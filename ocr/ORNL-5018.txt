1. PROGRAM PLAN OVERVIEW

1.1 INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY

The objective of developing breeder reactors is to obtain a reliable
and abundant source of energy through efficient use of our uranium and
thorium resources. Molten-salt breeder reactors have attributes of
fuel utilization, economics, and safety that make them well suited to
this objective.!l The highly successful operating experience of the
Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment and the developments in chemical proc-
esses that have allowed an important simplification in the breeder
concept support the belief that reactors having these characteristics
can be successfully developed. Because they differ in many aspects
from solid-fuel fast breeder reactors, MSBRs provide good insurance
for the nation's energy supply in case major obstacles are encountered
by the other concepts. In addition, the ability of the molten-salt
reactor to be started up as a breeder or operated economically as a
converter on plutonium, 235g, or 233U makes it particularly suitable
as a companion for other types of reactors in a balanced fuel economy.
It is believed that a strongly motivated and adequately funded program
can lead to molten~salt breeder reactors that can play a major role in
providing for our future energy needs.

This program plan for the development of the molten-salt breeder reactor
(MSBR) is based on two primary ground rules provided by the AEC. First,
a program will be undertaken to resolve the major uncertainties concern-
ing the technical feasibility of molten-salt breeder reactors. Then,
assuming favorable resolution of these uncertainties, development will
proceed in support of design and construction of a molten-salt test
reactor. The planning studies indicate that the crucial problem and
critical path item during the first phase of the work is demonstration
of an alloy for the structural material of the reactor primary system.
The alloy must have satisfactory resistance to surface cracking when
under stress in contact with the fuel salt in a reactor environment,
satisfactory corrosion resistance in fuel and coolant salts, and
satisfactory mechanical properties over the long-term under reactor
conditions.

In addition to demonstrating an acceptable material of construction for
the primary circuit, it is desirable to demonstrate, at least in principle,
the solutions to several other problems of molten-salt reactors before
proceeding with construction of a test reactor. A method should be
demonstrated for preventing tritium that is produced in large quantity

in the reactor fuel from transferring through the secondary coolant into
the steam system from which it would be released to the environment. In~
formation should be provided to assure that sodium fluoroborate will be
satisfactory for use as the secondary coolant of a breeder reactor or
that there is an acceptable alternate coclant. More complete information
should be obtained on the level of oxide contamination in the proposed
fuel salt that would cause troublesome precipitation of uranium from the
salt. The principles of any processes found necessary to control the
oxide concentration should be demonstrated.

Some further assurance should be provided that graphite can be obtained
commercially that will satisfy the minimum requirements for the core of

a large breeder reactor. Continuous on-line processing of the fuel will
be necessary to achieve a positive breeding gain in 2 molten-salt reactor.
Operation of the major process steps in engineering equipment should be
demonstrated.

Additional studies should be made for certain aspects of the reference
design MSBR in order to assure that an acceptable reference design has
been obtained. Finally, it will be necessary to show in a conceptual
design that the proposed test reactor is feasible to build and maintain,
that it can be operated safely, and that it can be expected tc provide
the information needed for proceeding with a larger demonstration plant.

It is estimated that with the funding currently projected for the Molten-
Salt Reactor Program these cbjectives can be achieved by the end of FY
1978. Conceptual design of a test reactor (estimated total cost, $450
million in FY 1975 dollars) and a test reactor mockup {estimated total
cost, $50 million in FY 1975 dollars) would be completed during FY 1979
for supporting requests for authorization of these projects in FY 1981.
It is anticipated that operation of the test reactor would begin in

FY 1989. The operating budget for research and development would rise
from $4 willion during FY 1975 to $11 million (in FY 1975 dollars) in

FY 1978. If it is determined that the Program is to proceed with de-
velopment for a test reactor, it is estimated that increases in research
and develepment funds will be required to a level of $13 to $19 million
per vear (im FY 1975 dollars) for the later years. The actual budgets
required for the years beyond FY 1978 will depend strongly on the size
and complexity of the test reactor. Since these are presently unknown,
the estimate of funds beyond FY 1979 involves large uncertainties.

1.2 STATUS OF TECHNOLOGY AND PLANNED DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES

In this subsection, a brief summary will be given of the status of the
technology and planned development activities for each of the major
areas of the Molten-Salt Reactor Program. A more detailed discussion
of the status of technology, the development plans, the estimated
schedule, the key program milestones, and the funds required for main-
taining the indicated schedule is given in the remaining sections of
this program plan for each of the major program areas.

1.2.1 Development of structural metal for primary and secondary circuits
Hastelloy N was developed for use with molten salts at the high tempera-

tures required by aircraft power plants, and since it has good strength
and good compatibility with fluoride salts, it was used for construction
 

 

1-3

of the 7.4-MW(t) Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE). While the MSRE
was being built, experiments revealed that the creep ductility of Hastel-
loy N is reduced by neutron irradiation. This embrittlement is caused by
helium produced by thermal neutron captures in the alloy in contrast with
the embrittlement due to void formation by fast neutrons that has been of
concern for fast reactors. Analyses showed that the stresses in the MSRE
would be sufficiently low for the reactor to be operated safely in spite
of decreased ductility, but this will not necessarily be true of future
reactors, and a development program was begun for finding a solution to
the embrittlement problem. The approach followed was that of adding
carbide-forming elements which have been used to ameliorate the embrittle-
ment of stainless steel by fast neutrons, and 0.5 wtZ Ti was found to
sustain the ductility of Hastelloy N at the MSRE operating temperature

of 1200°F. At 1300°F, the outlet temperature of the reference design
MSBR, sclution of the carbides in the alloy caused the remedy to be lost,
but this was overcome by raising the titanium content to about 27%. Some
further gain was made by adding niobium with the titanium, and hafnium

in conjunction with titanium was found to be very effective. However,
higher costs and problems with weldability decreased the desirability

of hafnium-containing alloys.

Small commercial heats (100 1b) of 27-Ti-modified Hastelloy N obtained
from three vendors were found to have minimum creep ductilities that
were greater than 47 at 1400°F after irradiation, which appears to be
adequate. The material is fabricable into small tubes and weldable
under high restraint; hence a solution to the embrittlement problem
appears to have been found.

Extensive natural- and forced-circulation loop tests, as well as operation
of the MSRE, have shown that the generalized corrosion rate of Hastelloy N
in fuel salt is very low; however, examination of specimens from the MSRE
indicated that standard Hastelloy N is subject to intergranular attack by
the fission product tellurium. Subsequent tests showed that a number of
materials are not attacked by tellurium, and among them are modifications
of Hastelloy N. The 2%-Ti-modified Hastelloy N is observed to have in-
creased resistance to tellurium attack, and the addition of small amounts
of rare earths or niobium has been observed to prevent tellurium~induced
intergranular attack.

The development program outlined in Section 2 includes further tests on
small commercial heats of titanium-modified Hastelloy N for demonstrating
that this material has adequate resistance to tellurium-induced inter-
granular attack, to irradiation embrittiement, and to generalized corro~
sion by fuel and coolant salts. It is anticipated that a decision on an
acceptable alloy composition can be made by the end of FY 1976. At that
time, several 10,000-1b commercial heats of modified Hastelloy N having
this composition will be procured from two or more vendors for extensive
evaluation tests. The tests will be concerned with complete characteri-
zation of the mechanical and physical properties of the large heats, and
test data of 10,000~hr duration will be obtained in some cases. In-pile
irradiation tests, as well as forced-circulation corrosion tests, will be
1-4

carried out for demonstrating the acceptability of the material for use
in the primary circuit of an MSBR. The data thus obtained will serve
as the basis for preparation and submission of a code case for the use
of modified Hastelloy N in the MSBR primary circuit. Subsequent work
on the development of materials for the primary and secondary circuits
of molten-salt reactors will be concerned with obtaining long-term
material test data and for further optimization of the alloy composition a
in order to further improve its materials properties.

1.2.2 Fuel processing

Operation of a molten-salt reactor as a high performance breeder is made
possible by the continuous processing of the fuel salt in a facility that
is located at the reactor site. As outlined in Section 3, the most im-
portant processing operations consist in removing the fission products
(principally the rare earths) and isolating 23°Pa from the region of high a
neutron flux during its decay to 233y in order to hold neutron absorption

in these materials to acceptably low levels. It is also necessary that

excess uranium produced in the system be removed for sale, that the fuel i
salt be maintained at the proper redox potential, and that oxide and

corrosion products in the salt be maintained at tolerable levels.

 

Processing of MSBR fuel salt is based principally on three types of oper-
ations: removal of uranium from the salt by fluorination; selective re-—
moval of protactinium, rare earths, and other fission products from the
salt by extraction into molten bismuth; and the hydrogen-reduction of a
UFg to UF, in the presence of the processed fuel carrier salt. In addi-

tion to these operations, there is the necessity for zuxiliary support

systems and operations required for close-coupled fuel processing. a

The chemical basis on which the processing system is founded is well
established; however, only small engineering experiments have been
carried out to date, and a considerable engineering development effort
remains. During the period FY 1975 — FY 1978, engineering experiments
will be carried out for demonstrating the individual processing steps
on a scale that ranges from 5 to 507 of that required for processing Gi
a 1000-MW(e} MSBR. This work will be carried out in the high bay area

of the MSRE building (Bldg. 7503) where adequate space is available.

Subsequent work on fuel processing will require the construction of FE
a new building (the MSBR Processing Engineering Laboratory) in which
the simultaneous operation of two or more process steps will be studied
and additional development work carried out. Authorization for this
facility, which is estimated to cost $12 million, is required early in
FY 1977. Subsequent to completion of engineering experiments dealing
with a single process operation, a system (the Integrated Process Test
Facility) will be constructed for the nonradioactive demonstration of i
processes and equipment for fuel processing at the pilot plant level.
This facility will be used to demonstrate the safety and performance
reliability of processing systems, to provide information for develop-
ment of maintenance methods, and to provide a basis for evaluation of
 

 

 

 

1-5

continuous on-site processing of MSBR fuel salt. Sufficient information
will result from operation of this and earlier engineering systems to
allow detailed design of a processing plant for a test reactor and com-
pletion of conceptual design studies for the reference design MSBR.

The actinides constitute a long-term waste hazard for all nuclear power
reactors, and it is desirable to develop means for recycling those pro-
duced in an MSBR to the reactor for transformation to less undesirable
isotopes via transmutation and/or fission. Studies will be carried out
during the early phases of work on fuel processing in order to determine
the potential for attaining actinide separation and recycle in an MSBR
and for the development of flowsheets and equipment necessary for effect-
ing this result.

1.2.3 Fuel processing materials development

 

The materials requirements for MSBR fuel processing systems are dependent
upon the processing methods utilized and the design of particular equip-~
ment items selected for effecting these processing steps. At this time,
studies aimed at final selection of processing steps are being completed;
hence, design of the processing plant equipment has not been carried out.
Processes involving removal of uranium from fuel salt by fluorination

and selective extraction of protactinium and fission products from fuel
salt inte liquid bismuth are considered the most promising methods avail-
able, and the current processing materials program is oriented in this
direction.

It is not necessary that a single material be compatible with all environ-
ments anticipated in the processing plant since the system can be designed
te allow segregation of particular portions of the plant. It is expected
that at least two classes of materials will be required: one for the
fluorination and fuel reconstitution steps and another for the reductive
extraction steps. Nickel or a nickel-based alloy, which in some cases
must be protected from corrosion by a layer of frozen salt, can be used
for construction of fluorinators, and for those portions of a plant which
contain fluorine, UFg, and HF. The corrosion of nickel and nickel-based
alloys during fluorination operations has been evaluated extensively at
ORNL. Much of the information has evolved from fuel recovery operations
conducted with molten fluoride mixtures using irradiated metallic fuel
elements. These data afford useful guidelines and background information
for the selection of materials for the proposed fluorination and recon-
stitution steps, but show the importance of inerting the metal surfaces

in fluorination systems with a passive frozen salt layer. In addition

to compatibility evaluations, many years of experience have been accumu-
lated in the fabrication and joining of this class of materials stemming
from the construction of reactors and associated hardware as well as
fluoride-salt purification equipment. Hence, very little research and
development work of a materials nature will be required for those portions
of the processing system that are fabricated from nickel or nickel-based
alloys.
1-6

Materials which have shown goed compatibility with bismuth solutions
during limited tests include graphite and refractory metals such as
tungsten, rhenium, molybdenum, and tantalum. Except for tantalum,
these materials are difficult to fabricate and join. All oxidize
rapidly in air at process temperatures and require atmospheric pro-
tection. It appears that the use of graphite for processing vessels
and molvbdenum or molybdenum alloys for interconmecting lines, agi-
tators, and other components, represents the optimum combination of
available materials for the reductive extraction portions of the
processing system.

Although molybdenum has excellent resistance to corrosion by bismuth
solutions or molten-fluoride mixtures, the use of molybdenum as a struc-
tural material requires highly specialized assembly procedures and imposes
stringent limitations on equipment design from the standpoints of geometry
and rigidity. Several advances in molybdenum fabrication techniques have
been made at ORNL. Although helium leak-tight molybdenum welds have been
produced consistently using both electron-beam and tungsten-arc techniques,
the ductile-brittle transition of the resulting welds is above room tem—
perature. Hence, each joint must be carefully designed to mechanically
support the resulting welds. The results of work to date on molybdenum
fabrication techniques have been encouraging, and it is believed that

the material can be used in constructing small components for processing
systems 1f proper attention is given to its fabrication characteristics.

In contrast to molybdenum, tantalum or the tantalum alloy T-111 is quite
ductile in the as-welded condition, and several complex assemblies have
been fabricated at ORNL using T-111. The resistance of this alloy to
corrosion by bismuth sclutions at 700°C is adequate; however, its resis-
tance to corrosion by MSBR fuel carrier salt is unknown and is considered
marginal from thermodynamic considerations. However, tantalum would with-
stand attack by molten LiCl which is present in some portions of the
processing plant. Tantalum, or 7-111, would require a higher degree of
protection from interstitial impurities (0, C, N) than would molybdenum.

Graphite, which has excellent compatibility with fuel salt, also shows
promise for containing bismuth solutions. Tests have shown no evidence
of chemical interaction between graphite and bismuth containing up to

50 at. % lithium at 700°C, although the largest pores of commercially
available graphite are penetrated to some extent by bismuth soclutioms.

It is believed that the extent of penetration can be reduced to tolerable
levels by the use of established surface-sealing techniques. Some work
on graphite~to-graphite and graphite-to-metal joints will be required.

It is expected that a combination of graphite, molybdenum, and perhaps
tantalum will be used in those portions of fuel processing systems that
contain bismuth. Although tantalum alloys present few engineering de-
velopmental problems, it is expected that compatibility with molten
fluorides and susceptibility to environmental contamination may limit
their use. From an engineering point of view the use of graphite will
require less development work than molybdenum and therefore major emphasis

 

 
 

 

 

1-7

will be placed on studies of graphite for the near term. The work to
be undertaken in the longer term, however, allows for additional de-
velopment of these materials for more extensive processing plant appli-
cations. Near—term compatibility results and fuel processing flowsheet
developments will dictate the extent to which subseguent work will be
undertaken for each of the materials.

As outlined in Section 4, work will be carried out initially to thoroughly
investigate the chemical compatibility of potential container materials
with fuel processing system environments under simulated processing con-
ditions. The work will include investigations of the chemical compati-
bility of graphite, molybdenum, and tantalum with bismuth sclutions and
molten-salt mixtures as well as compatibility of suitable braze alloys
with these sclutions. The work will involve a number of capsule and
thermal convection loop tests, as well as the operation of a graphite
forced-convection loop for study of graphite corrosion in the presence
of velocity and temperature gradients. If graphite is found to be un—
acceptable for use in processing plant applications, it may be necessary
to operate additional forced convection loops that are constructed of
tantalum.

Upon completion of the compatibility studies, the second phase of the
work will be undertaken which involves the development of the required
fabrication and joining techniques for materials whose compatibility has
been demonstrated. For example, the joining of graphite will be studied
by the techniques of brazing, adhesive bonding, high-temperature diffusion
bonding, and the use of mechanical joints. The extent to which fabrica-
tion and joining techniques will be studied for molybdenum and tantalum
alloys will be dependent upon the acceptability of graphite as a material
of comstruction.

The third phase of the processing materials development activity will in-

volve assistance during construction and operation of engineering experi-

ments on fuel processing. Information on materials relative to the design
and construction of experimental systems will be provided, and a surveil-

lance program will be carried out te evaluate the effect of fuel process—

ing operations on materials properties.

1.2.4 Chemical research and development

Molten-salt systems for high-temperature nuclear reactors have been under
development since 1947, and extensive experience with fluoride~based salts
has been accumulated. First developed were NaF-ZrF,-UF, mixtures which
fueled the Aircraft Reactor Experiment in 1954. As breeder reactor de-
velopment received increased emphasis, a fuel composed of ’LiF-BeF,~ZrF,~UF,
was developed and used in the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment which operated
for a total of 2.5 years beginning in 1966 and ending with the scheduled
reactor shutdown. Extensive experience with fluoride-based molten salts
was accumulated during this period; thus, the present MSBR fuel salt is
1-8

based on z long, well established background of experience and appears
quite likely to meet the requirements of MSBRs with a minimum of addi-
tional research and development. a

Previous work with coolant salts has been much more limited than that
with fuel salts. The coolant salt for the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment,
a LiF-BeF; mixture, was used to reject heat to an air radiator. The melt-
ing point of the mixture is higher than is acceptable for use with a con-
ventional steam system. The use of sodium fluorcborate as a coolant was

first suggested in 1966 and experience with this salt has been accumulated Gi
since that time. Considerable additional research is needed to assure

that the salt will be a satisfactory coolant. The salt is more corrosive

toward Hastelloy N than is the fuel salt, and additional knowledge of a
corrosion reactions is required. Interactions of the coolant with fuel

salt and with steam, which could result from steam generator leaks, need

to be more fully considered, and additional measurements of physical

properties are needed. Although fluoroborate can possibly be used as

the coolant salt for MSBRs, there is incentive to consider alternative

coolant materials and evaluation of alternate coolants will receive early

attention in addition to research and development on fluoroborate. ws

The objective of work outlined in Section 5 is to obtain the chemical

information necessary for the design of meolten-salt breeder reactors. i
Work in the activity will include studies of fuel and coolant salt chem-
istry, measurement of the required physical properties, studies relating
to tritium management and the delineation of operating parameters, and
chemical studies related to off-design events such as temperature ex—
cursion or leaks.

Laboratory~scale studies will be carried out which will involve detailed i
investigations of the chemistry of MSBR fuel salt including measurement

of solubility products for the actinide oxides, studies of the solution

behavior of tellurium under various redox conditions, phase behavior of Gi
PuF3, fuel~-cooclant interactions, and determination of physical property

data. Similarly, understanding of the chemistry of the coolant salt
must be greatly enhanced. Oxide and hydroxide chemistry in fluoroborate
will receive intensive study along with investigations of the corrosion
chemistry of this salt, methods for purifying the salt, and measurements
of physical properties. An assessment of alternate coolants will be

made. E

Tritium behavior in MSBR systems will also require a major effort. Im

addition to measurements of the permeability of various alloys to tritium, a
the possibility of sustaining an impermeable oxide film on the steam side
of steam generator tubes will be fully explored. Measurements of the
solubilities, diffusivities, etc. of tritium and HT in fuel and coolant
salts will be made to aid in predicting tritium behavior in MSBR systems. =
Studies of fission product chemistry will be focused chiefly on the

chemistry of nicbium, molybdenum, and other noble metals, and iodine 5
in order to allow the accurate prediction of fission product distribution
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

LEA

in an MSBR. Fundamental studies of LiF-BeF,~-ThF, mixtures will include
determination of activity coefficients of both major and minor components
of that system. Porous electrodes will be used to study the chemistry of
trace elements such as bismuth in MSBR fuel salt.

1.2.5 Analytical research and development

Substantial experience in the handling and analysis of nonradioactive
fluoride melts was gained in the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Program.
Methods were developed for analysis of most cationic constituents of
interest as well as for fluoride and various forms of sulfur. Applica-
tion of these techniques to the analysis of radicactive samples from
the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment required adaptation of the methods
to remote, hot-cell operations. More recently, the development of im-
proved analysis methods for discrete samples has continued as well as
the incorporation of a variety of improved instrumental methods as they
have become available.

Operation of an MSBR will require that adequate surveillance be maintained
on the composition of various reactor streams. The more critical determi-
nations are amenable to in-line measurement, and factors such as time,
cost, and difficulty of analysis by the discrete-sample approach argue
strongly that in-line techniques be developed when practical. There is
also the necessity for development of in-line and special analytical
techniques as required during the technology development activities of

the Program. It is anticipated that the development of analytical tech-
niques required for the technology phase of the Program will result in

an adequate base for further development as required by test and demon-
stration reactors.

For the analysis of molten-salt streams, electroanalytical techniques
such as voltammetry and potentiometry appear to offer the most convenient
transducers for remote in-line measurements. For example, determination
of the redox potential of MSBR fuel salt, as indicated by the US*/y**
ratio, as well as the concentration of corrosion product Cr2¥, has been
made on a completely automated basis over a period of several months in
thermal- and forced-convection test loops.

Other important analytical techniques include spectrophotometric methods
for both salt and gas streams, and the use of transpiration methods where-
by the composition of a molten—-salt phase is inferred by analysis of a

gas stream which has been equilibrated with the salt.

The work outlined in Section 6 allows for the development of devices which
show promise for in-line applications as required during the development
of MSBR technology as well as the operation of test and demonstration
reactors. Characteristically, development of a particular in-line ana-
lytical device will be concentrated initially on the acquisition of

basic information underlying operation of the device. There will then
follow the testing of prototypic devices in nonradioactive systems.
1-10

Finally, those devices which show promise for reactor applications will
‘be tested under conditions simulating the anticipated reactor environment
with particular emphasis on the effects of radiation damage.

1.2.6 Reactor safety

Advances in the area of reactor technology, in general, and the work in
the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion and Molten-Salt Reactor Programs at ORNL
have provided much of the information required to demonstrate the safety
of molten-salt reactors. None of the work has indicated any safety issues
that cannot be resolved with existing technology; however, MSR safety
technology and the issues that are specific to this reactor concept have
not been subjected to the comprehensive analysis and assessment that have
been applied to other reactor concepts. Consequently, some additional
technology development is required to demonstrate clearly the safety of
these reactor systems. wd

The dynamics of MSBRs are influenced by the circulation of the fuel, but

these effects are well understood and preditable. A prompt negative tem- is
perature coefficient and a long neutron lifetime contribute to the reactor
stability, and, as shown by operation of the Molten-S5alt Reactor Experi-
ment, the small delayed neutvon fraction of uranium-233 causes no problem.
There is ample basis for confidence that damaging nuclear excursions are
highly improbable. Of the potential sources of reactivity increases,

the one that will require the most study is hideout of fissile material.
Oxide precipitation could lead to such hideout, but conditions that would i
permit it can be safely avoided.

The afterheat situation in this reactor is unique. The major heat source i
is much less intense then in solid-fuel cores because in an MSBR the bulk

of the fission products is incorporated in a large mass of fuel salt.

Furthermore, this heat source can be transferred into a reliably cooled

situation (the drain tank} under any accident condition. On the whole, ww
afterheat promises to be less of a problem in MSERs than in other reactors,

and the dilute heat source makes the "China syndrome” of less concern.

However, reliable cooling must be provided for those components and sys- Fr
tems in which fission products are held or deposited.

The design~basis accident in an MSBR is a rupture in the fuel system that
quickly spills the entire fuel inventory. Containment of the radiocactiv~
ity in this event 1s the chief safety consideration for an MSBR. The con-
tainment must be tight, but the behavior of the spilled salt and its fisg-
sion products is predictable, and designing to handle a spill safely ws
appears to be straightforward. Further, iodine and strontium, two of the

most hazardous fission products, remain in the salt as stable compounds.

As outlined in Section 7, studies within the area of reactor safety will
be concerned principally with the characteristics and behavior of mate~
rials, components, subsystems, and systems in abnormal circumstances that
would be expected to occur very infrequently, 1f at all, during the anti-
cipated lifetime of any given molten-salt reactor plant. To the extent
Gn

1-11

that the more normal operations of a plant define system conditions that
may be affected by accidents, some consideration must also be given to
normal plant behavior, Existing safety and safety-related technology
developed either within the Molten-Salt Reactor Program or within other
domestic or foreign reactor safety programs will be assessed, adapted as
required, and adopted for application to the safety effort whenever such
adoptions are consistent with the overall program objectives, Additional
safety technology will be developed only when unique, specified needs

are identified.

1.2.7 Reactor design and analysis

 

Over the past twenty years, several molten-salt reactor plants have been
examined conceptually, and two experimental molten-salt reactors were
built and operated at ORNL. The Aircraft Reactor Experiment, which oper-
ated briefly in 1954, demonstrated the basic reactor concept; however,
since the mission of that project was not central-station power genera-
tion, the reactor lacked many features that are important for large-scale
breeder reactors. During the mid 1960°'s the Moltem-Salt Reactor Experiment
was operated for an extended period and yielded much valuable data on
which power reactor concepts could be based. This system used a fuel salt
generally similar to that proposed for the breeder, an unclad graphite
moderator, a secondary coolant salt circuit, and a structural alloy of
interest to the breeder concept.

Two basic breeder concepts have been studied: the first of these involved
two radicactive primary coolants, a fissile stream of uranium, beryllium,
and lithium fluorides, and a completely separate blanket or fertile salt
of thorium, lithium, and beryllium fluorides. This system appeared to
offer excellent breeding performance, and a relatively simple fuel proc=-
essing plant; however, maintaining separation of the two fluids via
graphite tubes in the core would be difficult in view of the dimensional
changes which occur’ in graphite during neutron irradiation. Developments
in the area of chemical processing and recognition of alternate neutronic
design possibilities lead to the adoption of a single-fluid concept in
which both the fertile and fissile materials are dissolved in the same
primary salt.

For the past several years, the MSR conceptual design effort has been
directed toward the single-fluid breeder system which features a single,
large reactor vessel and four primsry coolant pumps that circulate fuel
salt between intermediate heat exchangers and the core. The reactor
vessel contains unclad graphite to provide neutron moderation in three
recognizable zones consisting of the core, the blanket, and the reflector.
The fuel salt circulates through the three zones, which are not physically
isolated from each other. The different neutronic effects in the zones
are achieved by carefully selecting the fuel-to-moderator ratio for each
zone. Each primary loop contains equipment for helium injection and
removal to provide for stripping of 135%e and other volatile species.

Some fuel salt is continually circulated between the drain tank and the
1-12

primary loops in order to cool portions of major components and the off-
gas stream. The drain tank provides the initial holdup for decay of
fission-product gases as well as afterheat removal capability if the fuel
salt must be drained from the primary circuit.

Beyond the primary system, there are no major differences between the
one=-fluid and the older, two-fluid concepts. A secondary salt, sodium
fluorcborate, transports the fission energy from each intermediate heat
exchanger to a steam generator, which is coupled to a more-or-less con-
ventional supercritical steam system for generation of electricity.

Although the basic reactor concept is reasonably well established, there
are a number of aspects that have not yet been studied in sufficient detail
to resolve all potential questions. These include the layout and design

of all major parts of the primary system. In particular, additional

stress analysis work is required to show that ordinary mechanical as

well as thermal stresses throughout the system are compatible with design
and life requirements for all conditions. )

The physical arrangement of the graphite inside the reactor vessel is
important in determining the performance of the system. Since graphite
dimensional changes are an effect of neutron irradiation, the core must
be designed to accommodate such changes without unacceptably degrading
the reactor performance. Also, the graphite arrangement must allow for
periodic replacement of at least some of the moderator. Additional work
is required to ensure that radiation heating is appropriately handled in
the reference design. All of the primary-system components within the
primary containment must be physically supported in a way such as to
accommodate thermal expansion effects and major disturbances such as
earthquakes without loss of integrity.

Commercial-scale MSBRs will be designed mechanically for a useful life

of 30 years at temperatures as high as 1300°F with numerous thermal
cycles; however, the design pressure is relatively low. Much of the tech-
nology that is being developed for other reactor concepts will be appli-
cable or at least adaptable to MSBR design problems; however, the struc-
tural material for the MSBR primary circult (Hastelloy N) has different
physical and aging characteristics than materials that are being developed
for other high-temperature reactors. Therefore, considerable effort

will be required to adapt, demonstrate the applicability of, and apply
appropriate design methods to MSBR systems.

Capital cost studies on molten-salt reactor plants have been made in
recent years by ORNL as well as several independent organizations. The
conclusions from these studies are that MSBRs appear to be economically
attractive in the U.S. power economy. Each of the studies was necessar-
ily limited in precision by the state of development of the conceptual
design that was subjected to analysis, and such limitations will continue
until MSBRs reach commercial application. However, the levels of uncer-
tainty can be expected to diminish as the reactor design evolves. Thus,
capital costs and other aspects of MSBR economics will be frequently
reassessed to ensure that design and development efforts are being applied
to systems that are, in fact, attractive.

Gi

 

uh
 

1-13

Finally, an important aspect of the capital and operating cost assess-
ments for molten-salt reactors is determining the impact that various
design options have on overall costs. The reference MSBR uses a particu-
lar design configuration, a particular secondary coolant, and a particular
steam cycle. Various alternatives have been and will continue to be
advanced from time to time including converter and simple burner reactors,
smaller or multi-use reactors, alternate secondary coolants and coolant
circuit configurations, and alternate steam cycles. The economic effects
of such alternatives, singularly and in various combinations, will be
examined to provide a sound basis for choosing the most desirable system(s)
to be developed.

1.2.8 Graphite development

 

The graphite in a single~fluid MSBR serves no structural purpose other
than to define the flow patterns of the salt in the reactor core and,

of course, to support the forces resulting from its own weight and momen-
tum transfer from the flowing salt. The requirements on the material

are dictated most strongly by nuclear considerations, namely stability

of the material against radiation-~-induced distortion, nonpenetrability

of the fuel-bearing molten salt, and nonabsorption of xenon into the
graphite. The practical limitations in meeting these requirements in
turn impose conditions on the core design, specifically the necessity to
provide for periodic graphite replacement and to limit the cross sectional
area of the graphite prisms.

The graphite present in the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment excluded salt,
but the total radiation dose was too low to make radiation damage a prob-
lem, and exclusion of xenon was not a specification. Although a graphite
stringer from the MSRE showed no effect of 2.5 years in contact with fuel
salt, it would not have met the radiation damage and gas permeability
requirements of an MSBR.

Radiation damage in most graphites results in shrinkage followed by
expansion at neutron fluences below those of interest for MSBRs. How-~
ever, special grades of graphite show little shrinkage and a longer
period before rapid expansion begins. A commercially available graphite
irradiated at MSBR temperatures was found to meet the four-year-life
assumption of the reference design. Although a material having adequate
radiation resistance appears to be available, a growing understanding

of radiation behavior should lead to longer irradiation life, thereby
decreasing the frequency with which part of the graphite must be replaced.

Sealing graphite to exclude xenon involves the use of pyrolytic carbon
deposited in the surface pores or in a thin layer on the graphite surface.
Either method will seal the graphite adequately, but the permeability of
most of the small samples tested has increased excessively during neutron
irradiation. The failures are thought to result from defects in the sur-
face coating of the unirradiated material seen in photographs obtained
using the scanning electron microscope. A new procedure for depositing
1-14

the coating has produced flaw-free samples that have shown improved
irradiation properties. However, scale-up of the process to accommodate
large pieces remains to be accomplished after a succesful coating method
has been developed.

If a suitable method for sealing the graphite is not developed the breed-
ing ratio of the MSBR will decrease by 0.005 to 0.01 because of increased
neutron captures in 135%e, with the specific change in breeding ratio
depending on the effectiveness of the noble-gas sparging system.

Work will be carried out on graphite development which includes studies
of a basic nature concerning damage mechanisms, fabrication studies to
develop graphite with improved dimensional stability, development of
sealing methods for reducing the permeability of the graphite to 135%e,
and measurements of the physical properties of graphites having potential
for MSBR application.

1.2.9 Reactor technology development

 

Although many of the components and systems for an MSBR power plant are
similar to those for solid-fuel reactors, the design requirements for
other comonents are different, and a number are unique to molten-salt
systems. Many components were investigated in the development programs
for the Aircraft Reactor Experiment and the Molten-Salt Reactor Experi-
ment, but not all have been developed, and increases in size or perform-
ance are required in most cases. Vertical-shaft centrifugal pumps with
overhung impellers were developed and used satisfactorily on the Aircraft
Reactor Experiment (ARE), the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment, and a num-
ber of salt loops. Although a 10- to 15-fold increase in capacity will
be needed in progressing from the MSRE to full-size MSBRs, the same basic
design as that used on the MSRE is specified in the reference MSBR design,
and the scale-up should be relatively straightforward. The MSBR inter-
mediate heat exchanger operated without difficulty, and analyses showed
no decrease in performance throughout the plant life.

The aspects of the MSBR that differ from the MSRE, aside from size, have
to do with the need for high performance in the MSBR to limit the fuel
salt inventory, and the requirement that failed tubes can either be
located and plugged in place or that a tube bundle or entire unit can
be replaced. Both of these approaches create design problems. However,
new techniques for plugging heat exchanger tubes being developed for
other uses should be helpful.

There were no steam generators on the ARE and MSRE, and there has been

noe experience with the generation of steam using high-melting salts. The
major problem is that in conventional steam cycles, the feed water enters
the steam generator at a temperature below the melting point of the fluor-
oborate (725°F). As a result, unless other measures are taken, some salt
would freeze on the tubes. Allowing a layer of salt to form might be
acceptable, but in the reference concept, the steam cycle has been altered

 
 

 

 

1-15

to increase the inlet steam temperature. A small penalty results in the
form of some additional equipment and a small loss in efficiency. Other
ways of overcoming the salt-freezing problem also appear feasible, such
as the reentrant tube approach that appears in some sodium-heated steam
generator concepts. The likelihood of steam generator leaks that intro-
duce moisture into the coolant will require that a cleanup system be
provided. One way to prevent entry of tritium into the steam system may
be to trap it in the coolant from which it would subsequently be removed.
A single processing system for the coolant salt may be able to accomplish
both requirements.

The noble gases are only slightly soluble in fuel salt, and consequently,
the fission product poisoning in an MSBR can be greatly reduced by sparg-
ing xenon from the salt as was demonstrated in the MSRE where over 807

of the 13%%e was removed. However, the somewhat different sparging system
proposed for the MSBR requires demonstration, and tests with salt are
planned in a large engineering loop that has been completed recently.
Studies will alsc be carried out in this system for determining the be~
havior of tritium in a large fuel salt circuit and the level of oxide
contamination in the fuel salt that would cause troublesome precipitation
of uranium from the salt. The principles of any processes found necessary
to control the oxide concentration will be demonstrated.

Experience with the fluoroborate coolant proposed for the MSBR is not
extensive, but an isothermal MSRE-scale loop and a number of small forced-
and natural-convection loops have been operated with this salt. Fluoro-
borate has a greater tendency to pick up moisture than other salts that
have been used in molten-salt reactors which makes it more corrosive, but
the corrosion rate with clean salt is modest. The BF3 vapor pressure
requries special provisions in the cover gas system, but these have been
worked out satisfactorily in the loops that have been operated. Studies
will be carried out in the MSRE-scale engineering loop for determining
the behavior of tritium and hydrogenocus species in large coolant-salt
circuits, for determining the distribution and behavior of corrosion
products, and for developing further the technology required for use of
fluorcborate as the secondary coolant for large MSBR systems.

In addition to the reactor technology areas discussed thus far, addi-
tional work will be carried out for the further development of primary
heat exchangers, valves, control rods, and containment and cell heating
methods, as well as the operation of a component test facility that will
furnish much of the information required for design, construction, and
operation of components for test and demonstration reactors.

1.2.10 Maintenance

The maintenance of all reactors requires the performance of various
mechanical operations on equipment, which because of radioactive con-
tamination and activation, is not directly accessible to maintenance
personnel. Depending upon the level of activity, the size of equipment,
and the design provisions for maintenance, anything from simple, local
1-16

shielding to fully remote manipulations may be required. The time
required to do maintenance and the cost of the maintenance provisions
increase with the degree of remoteness required.

The circulating fuel reactor has fission products and intense radiation
with which to contend, not only in the reactor vessel, but also in all

of the primary circuit through which the fuel salt circulates, the off-
gas system, and in the fuel processing plant. Thus, this reactor concept
requires radicactive maintenance of a greater scope than does a fixed-
fuel reactor. On the other hand, the refueling operation is simpler,

the radioactivity is retained on-site within one containment, and the
necessity of a separate maintenance organization and equipment for a

fuel reprocessing plant at another site is avoided.

Although maintenance design efforts cannot affect the size and activity
level of the components in a reactor, much can be done in the design
stages of the plant to influence strongly the degree of accessibility
and the complexity of the maintenance operation. The maintenance concept
for an MSBR is characterized by the following general principles:

{1) Each system is composed of manageable units joined by
suitable disconnects and lines which can be cut and
rewelded remotely.

(2) Each unit is accessible and replaceable from directly
above through removable shielding.

(3) Failed units are removed and replaced.

Much of the maintenance experience on which this concept rests resulted
from application of this approach to the MSRE. Only the simplest of
inspections and repairs could be done on failed equipment for the MSRE;
however, in an MSBR, economic considerations will dictate consideration
of more extensive repair capabilities.

It is clearly essential that maintenance design and development be con-
current with plant design, and this has been the case in conceptual
design studies to date. These studies have not indicated any insurmount-
able problems in maintaining a 1000-MW{e)} MSBR, and no serious conflicts
have arisen in imposing the maintenance requirements on the reactor
system.

Most of the techniques and many of the tools required for maintenance
operations have been developed. Several versatile maintenance shields
have been built and used. Optical viewing equipment — window inserts,
periscopes, adequate lighting — all are available. The use of a shielded
maintenance control room with windows, remotely operated TV, and remotely
controlled cranes and tooling, has been successfully demonstrated.
Remotely operable disconnects for electrical power, instrumentation, and
service piping are at a satisfactory state of development. The remote
fabrication of brazed joints in small system piping has been demonstrated
in connection with the MSRE.

Gn
 

 

 

i

 

1-17

Two important techniques that are requisites for maintaining large power
reactors are not available, however. They are remote welding and post-
maintenance inspection. It is highly desirable from the standpoint of
reliability that the MSBR fuel circulation system be of all-welded con-
struction; thus, remote cutting and rewelding of the system piping will

be required in the replacement of major components. Present generation
automatic welding machines are reliable and capable of making high quality
welds. These machines are not now capable of fully remote welding, and
work will be carried out to adapt them for MSBR maintenance requirements.

The provisions in the MSBR for access to equipment for maintenance opera-
tions are equally applicable to in-service inspection. Dependable appli-
cation of common methods for nondestructive inspection of welds will be
difficult in high-temperature, high-radiation environments. Related
methods currently being pursued in AEC and industrial programs promise

to be succesful, and the necessary work will be carried out for develop-
ing remote inspection methods for reactor welds under MSBR conditions.

1.2.11 Instrumentation and controls development

 

A significant effort in the development of MSRs will be devoted to the
study of methods for controlling the reactor systems during startup,
part load, full load, and under upset conditions to allow proper assess-
ment of the operational and safety implications of various control
approaches, While it appears that instrumentation and controls systems
for MSBRs are relatively straightforward, a number of features inherent
in this reactor type dictate further development of the technology asso-
ciated with the control methods and systems.

Work in this area will be restricted initially to demonstrating that
satisfactory control methods can be devised for the various operational
modes necessary for molten-salt reactors, and the identification and
development of instrumentation required for utilization of control methods
having the greatest potential. The work will be concentrated primarily

on the requirements for a 1000-MW(e) MSBR in order to identify technology
areas requiring further development and demonstration before and during
operation of molten-salt test and demonstration reactors. Studies will be
carried out as necessary for characterizing transients which may occur
during normal accident conditions with the preferred control methods in
order that these conditions can be considered properly during the develop-
ment of components and materials for the various reactor systems. As

the designs progress for test and demonstration reactors, more detailed
attention will be given to the control requirements for these reactors.

1.2.12 Molten-Salt Test Reactor mockup

 

The development work outlined previously will be aimed at providing the
technology required for design of components for a molten-salt test
reactor; however, a number of important aspects related to test reactor
1-18

design and operation cannot be fully demonstrated by the outlined work.
For this reason, it appears desirable to design, construct, and operate
a mockup consisting of important portions of the test reactor. The
systems to be mocked up will consist largely of the primary and secondary
circuits for the reactor plus portions of the steam-raising equipment.
The mockup will be designed for operation in principally an isothermal
manner and will be used for testing of full-scale prototypic components
for the test reactor. It is intended that the test reactor mockup will
be operated in a parallel manner with other component development facil-
ities in which scaled-down versions of test reactor components will be
tested over the full range of anticipated operating conditions.

Other benefits which will accrue from work associated with the test
reactor mockup include obtaining experience during the design and con-
struction phases which will be directly applicable to the test reactor,
providing an opportunity for testing of remote maintenance equipment
and techniques prior to test reactor operation, and allowing an oppor-
tunity for operator training in support of the test reactor.

1.2.13 Molten-Salt Test Reactor

 

A number of important questions related to the design of moltem-salt
breeder reactors can be answered only through the construction and opera-~
tion of a test reactor. These include the need for additional reactor
operating and maintenance experience under conditions more closely resem
bling molten-salt power reactors in order to obtain improved estimates for
the availability and maintenance costs of molten-salt breeder reactors,
the need for operation of a continuous processing system in which repre-
sentative quantities of protactinium and fission products are present, and
the need for an improved definition of the behavior and distribution of
noble-metal fission products and tritium in a reactor system. Finally,
there is the need for the ultimate demonstration that a satisfactory
material of construction for the reactor primary circuit has been devel-
oped and the need for obtaining experience with design, fabrication, and
operation of larger reactor components.

Neither the optimum size nor complexity of the test reactor has been
determined at this time. If at all possible, the test reactor should be
sufficiently large that experience can be obtained with components that
are full scale for a demonstration reactor. It is anticipated that the
preliminary conceptual design studies outlined in Section 8 of this pro-
gram plan will lead to a clear definition of the design and operational
requirements for the test reactor. Final design of the system will be
completed by the end of FY 1985, and operation should begin early

in FY 1989. The estimated cost for the design and construction of the
test reactor is $450 million (dn FY 1975 dollars). This estimate should
be considered to be very preliminary since it is not supported by detailed
design or cost estimation.

Conceptual design of a molten-salt demonstration reactor would be ini-
tiated during FY 1982 in support of a request for obtaining FY 1985
authorization for the design and construction of a demonstratien reactor.

2. DEVELOPMENT OF STRUCTURAL METAL FOR
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY CIRCUITS

2.1 INTRODUCTION

The material used in constructing the MSBR primary circuit will operate
over the temperature range of 1050 to 1300°F. The environment outside
the primary circuit will be oxidizing and comprised primarily of nitrogen.
The interior surfaces of the primary circuit will be exposed to salt
containing fission products, and will receive a maximum thermal neutron
fluence of about 1 x 102! neutrons/cm?. The operating lifetime of a
reactor will be about 250,000 hr (about 30 yr). The material must be
fabricable into many products, and capable of being formed and welded by
conventional shop techniques.

In the secondary circuit, the material will be exposed to the coolant
salt over the temperature range 850 to 1150°F under much the same con-
ditions as for the primary circuit except for the absence of fission
products and neutron irradiation. Thus, the activities required for
development of material for the primary circuit will suffice for the
secondary circuit if supplanted by information on the compatibility of
the material with the coolant salt.

2.1.1 Objective

The objective of this program is to develop a material that will operate
successfully under the conditions described above.

2.1.2 Scope

Hastelloy N was the sole metallic material used in constructing the MSRE.
Although the mission of that reactor was not compromised, experience
revealed that Hastelloy N was embrittled by neutron irradiation and
formed intergranular cracks due to interaction with the fission product
tellurium. More recent experiments have shown that chemical modifica-
tions of Hastelloy N are quite effective in increasing the resistance of
the material to embrittlement by neutron irradiation and to cracking by
tellurium. The activities described in the remainder of this section

are aimed at continuing the alloy development effort in order to obtain

a code-approved structural material for the primary and secondary circuit
of molten-salt reactors having adequate resistance to embrittlement by
neutron irradiation and attack by the fission product tellurium. The
work areas to be undertaken in this activity consist of (1) determination
of an acceptable alloy composition, (2) procurement of commercial heats
of the selected alloy, (3) extensive evaluation tests on product shapes
from the commercial heats, (4) the development of design methods and data
for the selected alloy and submission of an ASME code case for use of the
material in nuclear service, and (5) studies for optimization of the alloy
properties.
2-2

2.1.2.1 Task Group 1.1 Selection of alloy composition

 

Tests will be carried out to determine basic information related to

chemical interactions between Hastelloy N, tellurium and salt. The et
reaction products formed in the alloy will be identified and rate data

associated with their formation will be measured. Various alloys will

be irradiated to determine their resistance to neutron embrittlement. is
An important variable in these studies will be the alloy composition.

Emphasis will be placed on a modified Hastelloy N having a base composi-

tion of 12% Mo, 7% Cr, 0.05% C, balance Ni. Additions of Ti up to 2%

and rare earths (e.g., Ce, La) up to 0.02% will be evaluated. The end

result of work in this task group will be the selection of an alloy

with adequate resistance to neutron embrittlement and intergranular

cracking for use in molten-~salt reactors having a 30-yr life. a

2.1.2.2 Task Group 1.2 Procurement of commercial heats wd

 

After the composition of modified Hastelloy N has been fixed by the
work in Task Group 1.1, at least four large commercial heats (v10,000
1b each) will be procured for evaluation. The specifications written
for the procurement of this material will form the basis for future
procurement for construction of reactor systems. Orders for the four

heats will be placed with at least two vendors by competitive bidding. EE:
The material will be obtained in product forms typically required in

reactor construction. These materials will be carefully catalogued and

evaluated extensively in Task Group 1.3. i

2.1.2.3 Task Group 1.3 Evaluation of commercial heats

 

Product forms from the four large heats will be evaluated with respect
to several properties including weldability, mechanical properties,
compatibility with fuel salt containing fission products and coolant ws
salt, and physical properties. These tests will confirm the desirability

of the composition selected and will provide the data base required for

design of MSR components and systems. Tests of at least 10,000 hr dura- -

 

 

tion will be carried out. The quality of testing will be maintained at =
a high level to provide information having the precision necessary for
design purposes.
2.1.2.4 Task Group 1.4 Development of analytical design

methods——-ASME code case submission EE
The data obtained in Task Group 1.3 will be analyzed and correlated in
analytical forms that are most easily used by designers. Model tests .

necessary to develop high-temperature design methods will be carried

out. The data and the design methods will allow preparation and sub-

mission of a high-temperature ASME Pressure Vessel Code Case for use

of the material in nuclear service. _.
2-3

2.1.2.5 Task Group 1.5 Long-term materials test

The tests performed in Task Group 1.3 will be adequate for the design

of a molten-salt test reactor. However, the operation of this and
subsequent reactors would profit from the availability of longer-term
information. Some of the corrosion, creep, and fuel irradiation tests
initiated in Task Group 1.3 will be continued to provide this information.

2.1.2.6 Task Group 1.6 Alloy optimization

Although the alloy that will result from work im Task Groups 1.1 through
1.4 should be adequate for construction of a molten-salt test reactor
(Section 14), a demonstration reactor (Section 15), and commercial power
reactors, it is likely that further alloy development will lead to mate~
rials having improved characteristics which may allow a higher reactor
cutlet salt temperature or significant relaxation of design and cpera-
tional constraints. Some attention will also be given in this task group
to the use of cheaper, more readily available materials for construction
of power reactors.

2.2 PROGRAM BUDGET AND SCHEDULE

2.2.1 Schedule and key program milestones

The schedule for work in this activity is given in Table 2.2.1.1. The
key program milestones associated with the development of the structural

metal for the MSR primary and secondary circuits are listed in Table
2.2.1.2 and occur at the times indicated in Table 2.2.1.1.

Capital equipment funds are summarized in Table 2.2.2.2. GPP funds in

the amount of $300,000 will be required during FY 1976 for modification
of the Mechanical Property Test Laboratory.

2.3 MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS, BACKGROUND, AND STATUS OF DEVELOPMENT

2.3.1 Material requirements

 

The material used in the primary circuit will be exposed to fertile-
fissile salt containing fission products over the temperature range of
1050 to 1300°F. In the intermediate heat exchanger and in the remainder
of the secondary circuit this material will be exposed to the coolant
salt. The outside surfaces of the alloy will be exposed to the cell
environment which will likely be nitrogen containing 2 to 5% oxygen.

No metallic structural members will be located in the highest flux

regions, but the vessel wall will be exposed to peak thermal and fast
(>0.8 MeV) fluxes of 6.5 x 102 and 1.2 x 10!! neutrons ° cm™2 - sec”!.
With a8 30-year lifetime and an 807 load factor, the peak thermal and
fast fluences will be 5 x 1021 and 1 x 1020 neutrons/cm?, respectively.

An obvious requirement of the structural material is that it be fabri-
cable into the forms needed to build an engineering system. The basic
shapes required include plate, piping, tubing, and forgings. For assembly,
the material must be weldable both under well-controlled shop conditions
and in the field. a

2.3.2 Background .

2.3.2.1 Initial objectives and screening tests

 

The nuclear-powered aircraft application for which molten-salt reactors
were originally developed required that the fuel salt operate at around
1500°F. Inconel 600, out of which the Aircraft Reactor Experiment was
built, was not strong enough and corroded too rapidly at the design
temperature for long-term use. The existing alloys were screened for
corrosion resistance at this temperature and only two were found to be
satisfactory — Hastelloy B (Ni-287% Mo-5% Fe) and Hastelloy W (Ni-25%
Mo-5% Cr-5% Fe).l»2 However, both aged at the service temperature and
became quite brittle due to the formation of Ni-Mo intermetallic com-
pounds. These observations led to an alloy development program in which
INCR-8, or Hastelloy N, was developed. 3s" i

2.3.2.2 The metallurgy of Hastelloy N i

 

The commercial chemical specifications for "standard" Hastelloy N out

of which the MSRE was built, and for an alloy modified to give it im-

proved properties, are shown in Table 2.3.2.2. The molybdenum is

present for strengthening, but is not in sufficient concentration to

cause the formation of brittle compounds. Chromium is added in the

minimum concentration required to form a spinel~-type oxide.’ Iron is EE
allowed in sufficient quantities to permit chromium to be added as

ferrochrome; however, it is not a critical element in the alloy.

Manganese has some effect on the alloy by reacting with sulfur, but

sulfur is usually dealt with during melting by additions of elements

such as magnesium. Carbon is important because it forms carbides that

improve the strength and restrict grain growth during high-temperature Lo
treatments. Elements such as sulfur, phosphorus, and boron, and many b=
others not included in Table 2.3.2.2 are tramp or impurity elements that

serve no known useful purpose in the alloy. These elements generally

have little effect on the alloy behavior as long as they are kept at

reasonable concentrations.

2-10

Silicon is introduced by the refractories used in the air melting prac-
tice and is an important element. Hastelloy N containing 0.5 to 1%
silicon contains stringers of coarse carbides and will form some fine
carbides during annealing at 1200 to 1600°F.® These carbides are of
the MgC type, with M having the composition of 27.9% Ni, 3.3% Si, 0.6%
Fe, 56.1% Mo, and 407% Cr. They are not easily dissolved during anneal-
ing, so the alloy has stable properties over a broad range of operating da
temperatures. However, these predominantly coarse carbide precipitates
produce less desirable alloy properties than fine carbide precipitates

of the MC and MyC type. Several melting practices are currently in use
that result in low silicon concentrations. The carbides in these alloys
are of the MC type, where M is 80 to 907% molybdenum with the remainder
chromium. They are more easily dissolved than the MgC type which contains
silicon.
Thus, Hastelloy N is basically an alloy strengthened with molybdenum and

containing enough chromium for moderate oxidation resistance. The car- ES
bide type is controlled by the silicon concentration.

2.3.2.3 Corrosion resistance of Hastelloy N

 

Several hundred thousand hours of corrosion experience with Hastelloy N
and fluoride salts have been obtained in thermal convectionl!:?2 and pumped
systems.’ These experiments showed that the predominant corrosion mech-
anism in clean fluoride salts containing uranium is the selective leach-
ing of chromium. Only 7% of the alloy is chromium and this must diffuse
to the surface before it can be removed by the salt. DeVan measured the
rate of chromium diffusion in Hastelloy N, 8 and the measured diffusion
coefficients were used to estimate the chromium profile after 30-year
service at 650 and 700°C in salt sufficiently oxidizing to completely
deplete the alloy surface of Cr. Even in this extreme situation, the
depth of chromium removal was less than 10 mils.

 

 

The early work with Hastelloy N and other alloys revealed the importance

of controlling impurities in the salt. Impurity fluorides such as FeF,,

MoF,, and NiF; will react with Cr to form CrF;, a more stable fluoride. i
Water will react with the fluoride mixtures to form HF that will form
fluorides with all the structural metals. Such impurities led to rela-
tively high corrosion rates of even Hastelloy N in the early experiments.
However, with pure salt mixtures, very low corrosion rates were obtained.
The ultimate proof of this was the operation of the MSRE where the over-
all corrosion was quite low during almost four years at temperature.

 

 

The preceding discussion applied to the removal of material, but deposi-
tion is also of concern. As the salt circulates from hotter to cooler
regions, the solubilities of the corrosion products in the salt decrease,
and if concentrations are high enough, material may be deposited. This
process is complex, depending upon chemical driving forces and factors
such as geometry and flow conditions. Fortunately, the salts being
2-11

considered for an MSBR tend strongly to deposit material rather uniformly
throughout the cold region and have a minimal tendency to plug heat-
exchanger tubes and salt passages in cooler parts of the system.

2.3.2.4 Physical and mechanical properties of Hastelloy N

The physical and mechanical properties of Hastelloy N were evaluated
rather extensively before the MSRE was constructed. These properties
have been summarized previously. ® The strength of this alloy is quite
good because of the 167 molybdenum. The property changes with time are
small since the alloy does not form intermetallic compounds but only
small amounts of fine carbides.

2.3.2.5 Experience with Hastelloy N in the MSRE
2,3.2.5.1 Fabrication

Although the power level of the MSRE was low, the system was complex and
required the ability to carry out all of the basic fabrication steps.!®
Many thousands of pounds of basic product forms were procured from three
vendors. Some of the components were built by commercial vendors, but
most of the fabrication was done in the AEC-Union Carbide shops at Oak
Ridge and Paducah. Welding, brazing, and inspection procedures needed
for constructing the reactor were developed. One of the final steps

was to make use of the heaters on the vessel to postweld anneal the
final vessel closure weld.

2.3.2.5.2 Operation

No difficulties related to materials were encountered during MSRE oper~
ation. The primary system was held above 500°C for 30,807 hours and
was filled with fuel salt for 21,040 hours. The only failure involving
Hastelloy N was through-wall cracking of a freeze valve coincident with
final shutdown of the system.l? This failure was due to fatigue from

differential thermal expansion in a part that was constructed too
rigidly.

2.3.2.5.3 Corrosion

Corrosion during the operation of the MSRE was followed both by analyzing
the salts and examining surveillance specimens removed from the core.

The primary corrosion product CrF,, remained below its solubility limits
in the salt; so its concentration could be used as a measure of the
amount of chromium being removed from the metal. The results of such
analyses have been described in detail.l? A simple summary is that the
chromium removal was very small: the total amount accumulated in the
2-12

fuel salt was equivalent to that which would be removed from all metal
surfaces to a depth of 0.4 mil; the amount appearing in the coolant
salt was practically nil.

Surveillance samples located in the core of the MSRE were periodically
removed for examination and testing. Samples of both standard and
modified Hastelloy N were always in excellent physical condition with
only a slight amount of discoloration, 3s1%,15,18 and visual metallo-
graphic examination failed to reveal any changes that were attributable
to corrosion. (As discussed in detail later, a serious problem was re-
vealed after examination of tensile specimens that were stressed to
failure; however, the cause of the problem is not considered to be
"ecorrosion.")

The chromium gradients in some of these samples were measured by the
electronmicroprobe analyzer, and the worst case was a gradient that
extended about 0.8 mil into the material.l’ Standard metallographicl?
(+100 magnification) examination of several tubes from the coldest part
of the heat exchanger revealed only deposits of a few irom crystals.

The MSRE coolant circuit contained LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) at 530-650°C
for about 26,000 hours. The chromium content of the coolant salt did
not change measurably during this time, and no chromium depletion could
be detected by metallographic methods.

Thus, the MSRE experience confirmed the basic compatibility of fuel
salt, Hastelloy N, and graphite that had been indicated by many tests.

2.3.2.5.4 Radiation embrittlement

Many of the surveillance samples from the MSRE were subjected to mechan-

ical property tests that confirmed the previous knowledge that Hastelloy N

is embrittled by neutron irradiation.l3:1%515:16 This embrittlement
occurs only at elevated temperatures and is due to helium formation in
the metal; it is quite universal among iron and nickel base alloys.18730
The degree of embrittlement in the MSRE was equivalent to that noted in
samples irradiated in the ETR and ORR. Thus, the mechanical properties

were not degraded differently when exposed to salt than when exposed only

to inert gas.

Fracture strain was the property of most concern with respect to the
MSRE. The fracture strains of some samples from the core were only 0.5%

in creep tests at 1200°F, in contrast to strains of 210% for unirradiated

samples. Surveillance specimens exposed alongside of the reactor vessel

at lower flux had strains of only 2%.1°:16 The control rod thimbles were

the only metal in the core, and they were subjected to small compressive
forces. The vessel was subjected to very small stresses. Consequently,
the rather low strain limits were not exceeded and the system operated
without failure from radiation damage.

 
2-13

= The entire area of the design of components for high temperature service
is receiving considerable attention. Although the strain limits have not
been firmly established, it seems likely that local strains above those
Eh allowed by standard Hastelloy N must be accommodated.

2.3.2.5.5 Grain-boundary cracks

 

A second problem noted with Hastelloy N removed from the MSRE was that
y shallow intergranular cracks formed in surveillance samples and on all
BE other surfaces in contact with the fuel.l3 17 These cracks generally
extended to depths of only about 5 mils, but some were as deep as 13 mils
in parts removed from the pump bowl. Although recognizable in metallo~
Sh graphic sections of some material removed from the MSRE, more were visible
and they were opened much wider after being strained in the hot cell.
Cracks found after straining material that had been exposed in the core
were no more pervasive or deeper than those in the heat-exchanger tubes,
which had been exposed to insignificant neutron flux. By controlled
dissolution of several samples, a number of fission products were found
within the material to a depth of several mils. This suggested that the
a cracking was caused by diffusion of fission products in the grain
boundaries — particularly tellurium, which was found at the highest
concentration.

2.3.3 Status of development

 

2.3.3.1 Generalized corrosion

Hastelloy N (both standard and modified) has been shown in the MSRE,
= other in-pile tests, and large number of ocut~of-pile loops to have ex-
cellent corrosion resistance in salts containing LiF, BeF,, ThF,, and
UF, .13257531 This extensive experience confirms the behavior that would
be predicted from diffusion calculations. Titanium forms a stable fluo-
ride, and the addition of this element to Hastelloy N could increase
the corrosion rate. However, diffusion measurements have shown that Ti
iN diffuses more slowly in Hastelloy N than Cr and that it would likely
a contribute very little to the corrosion rate. Several corrosion loops
containing insert samples of Ti-modified Hastelloy N confirm that the
modified alloy does not corrode more rapidly than standard Hastelloy N.
Ed In fact, the lower iron content (Table 2.1) causes the modifed alloy to
have a lower corrosion rate.

Corrosion studies with a proposed coolant salt, sodium fluoroborate,
have been more limited.32735 Four thermal convection loops and two
pumped systems have been operated for a total test time of about 140,000
hr. This experience reveals that the fluoroborate salt absorbs moisture
we guite readily, with attendant generalized corrosion. On occasions when
leaks developed, the corrosion rate has increased and then decreased as
the impurities were exhausted. During these periods of high corrosion
a all components of the alloy were removed uniformly from the hot leg and
2-14

deposited in the cold leg. Crystals of NasCrFg and NajFeFg deposited

in the cold regions as their solubilities were exceeded. Nevertheless,

pumped loops in which the ccolant salt is heated and cooled between
1270 and 795°F have been operated for several thousands of hours with =
corrosion rates of <0.1 mpy.

Screening experiments have shown that iron-base materials such as the wi

austenitic stainless steels and nickel-base alloys containing more Cr

than Hastelloy N have improved resistance to fission-product cracking.

For this reason, they may be considered as alternate candidates for use a
in the primary circuit if Hastelloy N cannot be modified to obtain

sufficient resistance.

The corrosion behavior of several other nickel-base alloys was investi-

gated in screening tests in the aircraft propulsion program. ls2 The

proposed service temperature was 1500°F and most of these alloys were

not considered further because in tests at that temperature large ws
amounts of chromium were removed, with formation of voids in the hot

regions of test loops and deposition of chromium crystals in the cold

regions. Inconel 600 received more study than any alloy besides an
Hastelloy N, and the evaluation program on it involved several thermal
convection loops and 9 forced convection loops that operated for a
total of 79,300 hr.’ Although the corrosion resistance of Inconel 600
was not as good as that of Hastelloy N, at MSBR temperatures the rates
were sometimes low enough to be of interest. For example, one Inconel
600 loop operated at a peak temperature of 1250°F for 8801 hr with
intergranular penetrations of 1.5 mils. This penetration is high by Gi
our current standards, but was only slightly higher than that observed

for Hastelloy N tested in salt of comparable purity. Thus, it is likely

that an alloy containing 157 chromium (e.g., Inconel 600} would have dd
acceptable corrosion resistance at 1200°F or less.

The compatibility of iron-base alloys with fluoride salts has received
relatively little attention because the thermodynamic data indicate that
nickel-base alloys with az minimum chromium content will be more corrosion
resistant than iron-base alloys. The initial screening tests on types

300 and 400 stainless steels indicated that these alloys were unsatis- i
factory.!s? However, one type 304L stainless steel thermal convection

loop containing a fuel salt has been in operation for over 9 years

without plugging;35 the corrosion rate at the peak temperature of 1270°F i
is about 1.5 mpy. It is quite likely that the corrosion rate could be
reduced to an acceptable value by decreasing the temperature to 1200°F,
but tests at higher velocities would be required to provide more con-
clusive information.

A most important comsideration in the suitability of iron-base alloys
is the possibility that, through some misoperation, the salt could be-
come sufficiently oxidizing to corrode the iron. This process would
not be diffusion controlled, and large amounts of material could be
transferred quickly from the hotter regions to the cooler regions of
the system. While this is also true for nickel, it can occur with iron

 

ta
2-15

at less severe conditions. However, the oxidation state can be con-
trolled closely enough for the salt to never become this oxidizing to
either material.

Iron-base alloys are not compatible with sodium fluoroborate since iron
seems to be attacked as readily as chromium. The use of duplex tubing
in the primary heat exchangers would likely be required if iron base
alloys were used for constructing the primary circuit.

2.3.3.2 Irradiation embrittlement

 

The peak fast fluence at the inside surface of the MSBR reactor vessel
will be of the order of 1020 neutrons/cm?, which is too low to cause
detectable swelling and void formation in the metal.3® However, the
peak thermal fluence of 5 x 102! neutrons/ecm? is great enough to pro-
duce significant amounts of helium, about 5 ppm from residual 108 and
possibly another 100 to 200 ppm by transmutations involving nickel.37
In standard Hastelloy N the helium would reduce the grain boundary
cohesion and increase the tendency for grain boundary fracture, with
the result that the fracture stains at elevated temperatures become
quite low.

The approach to combating embrittlement is to add elements such as
titanium, hafnium, zirconium and niobium that promote the formation of
finely dispersed MC type carbides.3® These carbides produce numerous
interfaces that trap the helium rather than allowing it to be swept
into the grain boundaries.

All of the carbide-forming elements are beneficial in improving the
fracture strain, but there are several practical reasons why titanium
and niobium are more desirable. Zirconium has been found to cause weld
metal cracking in concentrations as low as 0.057 and for this reason,
would be a very undesirable alloying addition.3® Hafnium causes weld
metal cracking at concentrations of about 0.7%, but the greatest

problem with using this element is its very high chemical reactivity.

In small laboratory melts in which the metal only contacts a water-cooled
copper mold, the hafnium is present as desirable finely dispersed car-
bides. In commercial melting practices where the melt contacts a re-
fractory crucible, the hafnium is primarily present as a coarse compound.
This likely occurs because hafnium is sufficiently reactive chemically
to reduce the oxides and other compounds in the refractory crucible.

The coarse compounds do not result in good mechanical properties after
irradiation. We have found that niobium additions alone do not improve
resistance to irradiation embrittlement, but they are beneficial when
titanium is present.38 However, both niobium and titanium form brittle
Nis (Ti, Nb} compounds and their total concentration must be limited.
Since titanium seems to be the most effective single additive in improv-
ing the resistance to irradiation, attention has been concentrated on
allovs which contain about 27 titanium.
2-16

The amount of titanium required for good resistance to neutron irradi-
ation depends strongly upon the service temperature.3® At 1200°F alloys
with 0.57 titanium have fracture strains of above 4%, but at an irradi-
ation temperature of 1400°F, 27 titanium is required to obtain the same
properties. Direct transmission electron microscope observations have
shown that this is due to the fine carbide becoming less stable, and
more titanium being necessary for stabilization as the service temper-

ature is

increased.

Several 100-1b commercial melts containing 1.5 to 2.17 titanium were

procured

from three vendors and evaluated. The mechanical properties

and weldability of the unirradiated melts are superior te those of

standard

Hastelloy N. The compatibility of titanium~containing alloys

with fuel salt has been investigated using specimens of modified alloys
in natural circulation loops, and some specimens were exposed in the
MSRE core. Although the titanium is reactive with the salt, it diffuses
less rapidly than the chromium and does not contribute detectably to the
corrosion rate.*® Hastelloy N modified by the addition of about 2%
titanium has thus been found to be adequately resistant to radiation at
1400°F, to be weldable without unusual difficulty, and to be free of
added corrosion problems. Commercial-scale production of this alloy
must be demonstrated, but the alloy composition does not appear to be
one that will present problems.

Exploratory irradiation studies have shown that Inconel 600 and all
other nickel-base alloys are embrittled at elevated temperatures by
thermal neutron irradiation.18,19,21,22,28-30 The fracture strains

vary for

different alloys, irradiation, and test conditions. However,

the fracture strains will likely be too low for alloys such as Inconel
600 without closer controls on chemistry, grain size, and other factors.

The stainless steels are also embrittled by irradiation, but it is pos-
sible that the fracture strains under MSBR service conditions will be

adequate.

“1 tf not, significant improvements have been made in types

304 and 316 stainless steel by controlling the grain size or altering
the composition {such as adding small amounts of Ti). 42

2.3.3.3

As noted earlier, intergranular cracking was observed in the surveillance

Intergranular cracking

 

samples and several components from the MSRE.17 The most significant
characteristics of the cracks are:

1.

2.

Cracks were formed on all surfaces exposed to fuel salt.

Irradiation of the metal did not seem to be a factor, since the
cracks were equally severe in components that were irradiated
and unirradiated.

 
 

2-17

3. Some cracks were visible in polished sections from some com~
ponents (particularly the heat exchanger) when they were
removed from service, but deformation at ambient temperature
was required to make most visible.

4. The material removed from the MSRE had been heated and exposed
te fission products for times ranging from 2500 to 25,000 hr.
Although the frequency of cracks increased with time, the
maximum depth did not increase detectably.

Similar intergranular cracks have not been produced by corrosion. To
determine whether corrosion could be the cause, the salt in one fuel-salt
loop was made quite oxidizing by adding FeF,. Selective integranular
attack occurred, but the attack was very shallow and the corroded grain
boundaries did not open further during straining. The second, and most
convincing evidence that corrosion (chromium depletion) did not cause
the cracks came directly from examination of MSRE samples. Although
chromium depletion could not be detected in samples from the heat ex-
changer and in a section of the control rod thimble that was under a
spacer sleeve, these samples were cracked as severely as those (e.g.,
the bare control rod thimble in which chromium depletion was detectable.
Thus, it seems unlikely that chromium depletion alone can account for
the observed cracking.

The next possible mechanism considered was that one or several elements
diffused into the material preferentially along the grain boundaries

and degraded them in some way. The process responsible for the cracking
could be (1) the formation of a compound that is very brittle, (2) for-
mation of low-melting phases along the grain boundaries that become
liquid at operating temperature, or (3) a change in composition along
the grain boundaries so that they are still solid but very weak. The
first and third mechanisms would require some deformation to form the
cracks, but the second mechanism would not require strain, and samples
could have cracks present before postoperation deformation. The results
of a number of tests and data from the literature'3>*" suggested strongly
that the intergranular attack is caused by the inward diffusion of ele-
ments of the sulfur, selenium, tellurium family with tellurium having
the most adverse effect, and subsequent studies were concentrated on
tellurium. Since these elements all behave similarly, an understanding
of how tellurium causes cracking should lead to an understanding of the
behaviour of the other elements.

Numerous laboratory experiments were run that demonstrate very clearly
that small amounts of tellurium will cause intergranular cracking in
Hastelloy N. These experiments include: (1) the measurement of grain
boundary and bulk diffusion coefficients of tellurium in Hastelloy N,

type 304 stainless steel, and nickel; (2) exposure of numerous materials
to electro- or vapor-plated tellurium with subsequent straining and
metallographic examination; (3) tube burst specimens of Hastelloy N

and type 304 stainless steel electroplated with tellurium and stressed

in salt; (4) creep tests of Hastelloy N, type 304 stainless steel, nickel,
2-18

and Inconel 600 in inert gas—-tellurium vapor environments; (5) strain
cycle experiments of Hastelloy N electroplated with tellurium to de~
termine crack propagation rates; and (6) mechanical property tests on
alloys containing small amounts of fission products.

The diffusion rate of tellurium into Hastelloy N was measured. Samples
with 127Te deposited on the surface were annealed for 3000 hr at 650

and 760°C. At 650°C the penetration was so shallow that the lapping
technique used did not give very reliable values, but accurate results
were obtained at 760°C and the diffusion coefficient in the bulk mate-
rial was 1.01 x 10-1" cm? /sec, about equivalent to that of chromium at
650°C. The penetration profiles also were used to obtain the product

of the grain boundary width and the grain boundary diffusion coefficient,
and measured quantities were then used with the Fisher model> to com~
pute the grain boundary penetration. On this basis, the maximum pene-
tration of tellurium in an MSBR at 760°C would be 8 mils in 30 years.
The less accurate experimental values obtained at 650°C were used to
estimate that tellurium should have penetrated the grain boundaries

in the MSRE to a depth of 2 to 3 mils, and the penetration of an MSBR
operating at 650°C for 30 yr should be about 4 mils. The relatively

low sensitivity of the penetration depth to the time is due to the
variation with time to the one-fourth power for grain boundary diffusion
compared with the one-half power for bulk diffusion. These computed
depths of penetration are quite acceptable, but several factors can
alter the results, hence they cannot be taken quantitatively.

Little is known about the chemistry of tellurium, but most likely it

is similar to that of sulfur. The basic problem with nickel alloys
containing sulfur is due to a low melting nickel-sulfur eutectic that
forms when sulfur segregates in the grain boundaries and causes these
regions to be weak relative to the matrix. Alloying additions such as
chromium raise the melting point of the eutectic and reduce the magnitude
of the problem. Some proprietary work on superalloys shows that about 16%
chromium is required to make a superalloy resist embrittlement by sulfur.
Assuming parallel behavior of tellurium, its deleterious effects on
Hastelloy N might be offset by the addition of chromium.

Additions of tellurium, selenium, and sulfur are often made to steels to
obtain improved machinability but they cause embrittlement at high tem-
peratures, Small cerium additions have been effective in reducing the
embrittlement. Thus cerium additions to Hastelloy N may also be effec-
tive in making the tellurium innocuous.

Tellurium probably behaves in non-fissioning melts much as it does in a
fissioning salt; hence, laboratory experiments can be used to answer
many questions related to tellurium—induced intergranular attack. A
large number of materials on which tellurium had been electrodeposited
or vapor deposited were annealed at 650°C for 1000 hr. Straining these
samples at room temperature resulted in intergranular cracks one grain
deep for standard Hastelloy N and a number of other materials. A num-~
ber of materials showed little or no intergranular attack, and those

Se

 
5

2-19

which are of interest for MSR's are shown in Table 2.3.3.3.1. Of these,
titanium-modified Hastelloy N may be sufficiently resistant to attack,
and no attack has been observed for the remaining materials. It is
believed that az satisfactory alloy can be obtained from one of the
first three categories, and it is known that these materials will also
have adequate resistance to neutron embrittlement and general corrosion.

If a higher chromium alloy were used (e.g., Inconel 600), it would be
necessary to test its neutron embrittlement characteristics and to de-
velop adequate resistance if this were not present. Neutron embrittle—
ment in type 304 stainless steel containing 0.2% Ti is not a problem.
Generalized corrosion could be a problem with both cf the latter
materials, and the reactor outlet temperature might have to be lowered
from 1300°F to 1200°F in the case of stainless steel. The nominal com-
position of the material of greatest interest is shown in Table 2.3.3.3.2.
The molybdenum and silicon contents have been decreased from those in
standard Hastelloy N, and 2% Ti has been added to provide resistance to
neutron embrittlement. The rare earths were added in low concentrations
to provide increased resistance to intergranular attack by tellurium.

2.4 TASK GROUP 1.1 DETERMINATION OF ALLOY COMPOSITION

Tests will be carried out to determine basic information related to
chemical reactions between Hastelloy N, tellurium, and salt. The
reaction products will be identified and the rate constants associated
with their formation will be measured. Various alloys will be irradiated
to determine their resistance to irradiation embrittlement. An important
variable in these studies will be the alloy composition. Emphasis will
be placed on a modified Hastelloy N having a base compositon of 127 Mo,
7% Cr, 0.05% C, balance Ni. Additions of titanium up to 2% and rare
earth (e.g., Ce, La) up to 0.02% will be evaluated. The end result of
this task should be the selection of an alloy with adequate resistance

to irradiation embrittlement and intergranular cracking which is also
compatible with the sodium fluoroborate coolant salt.

2.4.1 Objective

The objective of this task is to pinpoint the composition of modified
Hastelloy N that meets the requirements set forth in Subsection 2.3.1.

2.4.4 Facilities
This task will require use of the following facilities:

Bldg. 2013 — This building will house the mechanical testing equipment
(30 creep machines and strain cycle machines), data storage, research
material storage, some Te-Hastelloy N compatibility work, and alloy
annealing facilities.

Bldg. 4500S, Rm. T-40 — This laboratory will house the thermal convection
loops {(v12 loops).

 

Bldg. 9203-1 — The forced convection loops will be located on the
operating floor of this building.

ORR — Two poclside facilities and associated control rooms will be used
to irradiate mechanical property specimens of Hastelloy N and to irradi-
ate fuel capsules.

Hot Cells — One cell will be used in Bldg. 3025 for postirradiation creep
testing. Several other hot cells will be used for short periods of time
for experiment disassembly, metallography, and various other experiments
on irradiated materials.

Miscellaneous Labs in Bldg. 4500 — Several general purpose labs will be
used for this work.

2.4,5 Task 1.1.1 Procurement of test materials

The test materials to be procured focus on the further evaluation of the
effects of additions of titanium, rare earths, and niobium on the prop-
erties of Hastelloy N. The role of titanium in this alloy is reasonably
well established, and a 10,000-1b heat is being procured to obtain ex-
perience on melting and fabrication procedures. The addition of rare
earths or niobium in combination with titanium is aimed at obtaining
increased resistance to intergranular cracking. Only small heats of
these alloys will be prepared until the effects of these elements are
better understood. If the results from the small melts are encouraging,
commercial melts will be procured to further evaluate niobium and
rare-earth additions.

2.4.5.1 Subtask 1.1.1.1 Small commercial heats with
rare-earth additions

 

Four 125-1b commercial heats will be procured for evaluation. These
heats will consist of $0.01 to 0.02% additions of Ce, La, and Misch metal
(primarily Ce and La) to a modified Hastelloy N base containing 2% Ti.
The alloys will be prepared by vacuum induction melting followed by
electroslag remelting and relling to 1/2-in.-thick plate. The weld-
ability of the four melts will be determined, and the material will be
used in all portions of Task Group 1.1.

2.4.5.2 Subtask 1.1.1.2 10,000-1b commercial melt
containing 27 Ti

 

   

A 10,000-1b heat of modified Hastelloy N containing 27% Ti will be pro-
cured in order to obtain experience with the production of a commercial
heat of material which is believed to be close in composition to a number
of acceptable alloys. This alloy composition has been noted through
experience with several 100-1b heats to have excellent resistance to
irradiation embrittlement and better resistance to intergranular fission
product cracking than standard Hastelloy N. The large heat will be
fabricated into several product forms and will be utilized in many tasks
in Task Group 1.1.

2.4.5.3 Subtask 1.1.1.3 Laboratory melts having various
Nb=-Ti concentrations

 

 

Niobium additions improve the resistance of Hastelloy N te intergranular
cracking, but have very little effect on resistance to irradiation em-
brittlement. The combined use of titanium for affording resistance to
irradiation embrittlement and niobium for increasing the resistance to
tellurium intergranular attack will be explored. Niobium and titanium
are additive in inducing the formation of brittle gamma-prime in the
alloy, hence they must be added sparingly. About twenty laboratory
melts, each weighing about 2 1b, will be made with various additions of
titanium and niobium. These alloys will be evaluated in other tasks of
Task Group 1.1.

2.4.6 Task 1.1.2 Basic studies on interaction of tellurium with
Hastelloy N

Since actual reactor operating conditions represent an extrapolation

of experimental observations, it is imperative that reactions be under-
stood rather than their rates being measured over a relatively short

time period. This task is directed toward understanding the interactions
of tellurium, Hastelloy N, and salt in sufficient detail to define the
phenomena which lead to attack in standard Hastelloy N and to determine
how attack is prevented in potential materials of comstruction.
f=]

2.4.6,1 Subtask 1.1.2.1 Interaction of Hastelloy N
with tellurium vapor

 

 

Tellurium will be present as the metal dimer, Te,, and in smaller quan-
tities as the monomer, Te, and/or in a reduced state under the reducing
conditions that will be present in the MSBR primary circuit. Thus,
studies where Hastelloy N is exposed tc small amounts of tellurium

vapor are believed to simulate reactor operating conditions closely
enough to be valuable. Hastelloy N (modified and standard) will be
exposed tc tellurium vapor and the reacted metal will be used to identify
reaction products, evaluate effects on mechanical properties, and deter-
mine reaction kinetics. Variables studied will be tellurium concentration,
temperature, time, and alloy composition. Auger spectroscopy, electron-
microscopy, and x-ray diffraction will be used to identify reaction
products. Some samples will be deformed at ambient temperature after
exposure to tellurium. Samples will also be sectioned and viewed
metallographically to determine the extent of intergranular cracking.

2.4.6.2 Subtask 1.1.2.2 Interaction of Hastelloy N with tellurium
in fuel salt

 

The presence of salt is not likely to influence the interaction of
Hastelloy N and tellurium, but experiments are required to show that
this is the case. The principal source of compatibility samples will be
mechanical property test samples from Task 1.1.3 that will have been
exposed to salt which contains tellurium under well-defined conditions.
The reaction products will be identified by Auger and x-ray spectroscopy.
The extent of penetration of tellurium into the material will be deter-
mined by metallography.

2.4.7 Task 1.1.3 Effects of fission products on mechanical
properties

 

Review of the available information of the effects of fission product
elements on the mechanical properties of Hastelloy N indicates that
tellurium produces by far the largest effect; however, some work will be
continued on other elements to ensure that they do not also have adverse
effects which could be important under some conditions. Several alloys
have been prepared which contain small amounts of fission product ele-
ments, but most of the tests will involve undoped alloys that will be
stressed while also being exposed to a tellurium~containing environment.

2.4.7.1 Subtask 1.1.3.1 Creep tests

Small heats of Hastelloy N containing 0.01% Se, Te, Sr, Tc, Fu, Sn, and
Sb have been prepared previously. These materials will be tested under
creep conditions to determine how these elements influence the tendency
for crack formation during creep tests.
2-28

Creep tests of standard and modified Hastelloy N specimens will be run
in salt-tellurium environments to determine how the tendency to form
intergranular cracks varies with test conditions and metal composition.
Effects of tellurium on creep behavior will also be evaluated. About
6 creep machines with salt chambers will be used in this work.

2.4.7.2 Subtask 1.1.3.2 Tube burst tests

 

Tube burst samples of standard and modified Hastelloy N will be run in

a salt-tellurium environment. The tests will show the influence of tel-
lurium on the rupture life of a material, and post-test examination will
reveal the propensity for intergranular cracking. Variables studied will
include specimen composition, test temperature, stress, and tellurium
concentration. Twelve tube burst test positions will be in use continu-
ously during work on this subtask.

2.4.7.3 Subtask 1.1.3.3 Strain cycle tests

These tests will impose alternating strains on a tubular sample while

the outside surface of the sample is exposed to salt containing tellurium.
This condition will be similar to that experienced by a heat exchanger
tube being exposed to temperature transients. The time required for
cracks to propagate through the tube wall will be determined as a func-
tion of alloy composition, concentration of tellurium, strain limits,

and temperature. Five strain cycle machines will be used for this work.

2.4.8 Task 1.1.4 Thermal convection corrosion tests

 

Thermal convection lcops will be operated to study the corrosion of mod-
ified Hastelloy N in fuel salt. At least two loops will be comstructed

of standard Hastelloy N, and small coupons of the modified alloys will

be inserted im the loop for corrosion measurements. When tubing becomes
available from the large 2% Ti-modified heat, an entire loop will be
fabricated from this material. These loops will be equipped with electro-
chemical probes for measuring the u3t/u4* ratio and the concentrations

of Fe, Cr, and Ni in the salt. Loops of austenitic stainless steel and
Inconel 601 will be operated to determine the corrosion rates for materials
having chromium concentrations above that of Hastelloy N. At least one
Hastelloy N loop containing fuel salt will be used to determine the be-
havior of tellurium in a flowing system having a temperature gradient.

Two Hastelloy NK loops will be used to study the compatibility of Hastelloy
N with the coolant salt. Insert samples of modified Hastelloy N will be
exposed in this loop.

 
ih

2-29

2.4.9 Task 1.1.5 Forced convection corrosion tests

Thermal convection loops are a relatively inexpensive method for deter-
mining corrosion behavior. However, the salt flow velocity in a thermal
convection loop is only a few feet per minute as compared with velocities
up to 20 ft per second that will be present in an MSBR. These higher
velocities can increase the corrosion rate markedly over that observed
in thermal convection loops at the lower velocities. Thus, some corro-
sion testing must be done in pumped systems at realistic flow rates.

A versatile forced convection loop facility of near-standard design has
been developed for material tests of this type. Work in forced convee-
tion facilities associated with this task (designated FCL-2, -3, -4, and
-5) is discussed in more detail in the following sections.

2.4.9.1 Subtask 1.1.5.1 FCL-2

Portions of this facility which contact molten salt were constructed of
standard Hastelloy N and the facility was operated for 7,000 hours with
the sodium flucroborate coolant salt. The loop was modified in late FY
1974 to allow circulation of fuel salt. This loop, designed specifically
for materials testing, has a special pump designed toc give variable
pumping speeds. Test samples are located at three locations which can

be operated at different temperatures. The samples can be removed by
stopping the pump and melting a freeze valve at each location. The

flow passage geometries are such that the surface velocities at the test
coupons vary from 10 to 20 fps.

This loop will be used primarily for studying tellurium transport in a
flowing system having a temperature gradient. Two objectives that must
be accomplished before the loop can be operated as desired are (a) devel-
opment of on-line analytical technique to determine the ut/utt ratio and
tellurium-ion concentration in MSBR fuel salt (see Subtask 5.1.1.1),

and (b) measurement of the base-line corrosion rate of Hastelloy N under
the conditions to be used for the tellurium transport studies. Develop-
ment work in both of these areas is in progress; and tellurium will be
added to the system toward the end of FY 1975.

2.4.9.2 Subtask 1.1.5.2 FCL-3

This facility will be of the same basic design as FCL-2, but some design
improvements will be made. All parts of the facility which contact salt
will be fabricated from the 10,000-1b heat of 27% Ti-modified Hastelloy N.
This facility will be used primarily to study the corrosion characteristics
of the modified alloy in fuel salt. Work will begin on the facility early
in FY 1975 and the system should be in operation before mid FY 1976.
2-30

2.4.9.3 Subtask 1.1.5.3 FCL-4

 

The design of this facility will be the same as for FCL-3. Portions nr
of the facility that contact salt will be constructed of 2% Ti-modified
Hastelloy N. The facility will be operated with fuel salt, primarily

for study of tellurium transport in a flowing system having a temperature
differential. This loop will be in operation by mid FY 1976.

2.4.9.4 Subtask 1.1.5.4 FCL-5 Ga

 

This facility will be constructed of 2% Ti-modified Hastelloy N and will

contain coolant salt. The design will be quite similar to that of FCL-3
and -4, but will incorporate some changes due to the different physical
properties of the fuel and coolant salts. The primary objective of this
facility will be to determine the corrosion rate of the modifed alloy in
coolant salt. The facility will be equipped with on-line instrumentation
to chemically characterize the salt at all times. This loop will be in
operation by the end of FY 1976.

2.4.10 Task 1.1.6 In-reactor fueled capsule tests

Experiments have shown that intergranular cracking quite similar to that
noted in the MSRE can be produced in the laboratory by exposure of stand-
ard Hastelloy N to small amounts of tellurium. Thus, laboratory experi-
ments can be used as screening tests, but some in-reactor fueled tests wi
will be necessary as proof tests. Small {(v1/2 in. diam) tubes will be

partially filled with fuel salt and irradiated in the ORR. The fissile

content and irradiation time will be chosen to produce the desired a
amounts of fission products and alloy exposure interval. After irradia-
tion, the fuel pins will be sectioned and some portions will be deformed
to open intergranular cracks, while other strained and unstrained sec-
tions will be viewed metallographically to determine whether cracks were
formed. Samples will be examined from both the liquid and vapor portions
of the fuel tubes. In-reactor fueled capsule tests associated with this

task (designated TeGen-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, and -6) are discussed in greater ih
detail in the following sections.

2.4.10.1 Subtask 1.1.6.1 TeGen-1

In~-reactor capsule TeGen-1 will be irradiated for 1 cyele (1100 hr) in
the ORR poolside facility at 700°C. The 233U fuel loading was chosen
such that the amount of tellurium which will be produced is equivalent
to that produced in the MSRE during its entire operation. The fuel
pin materials are standard Hastelloy N, type 304 stainless steel, and ia
Inconel 601.
Ga

2-31

2.4,10.2 Subtask 1.1.6.2 TeGen-2

 

The design of capsule TeGen-2 will likely be the same as for TeGen-1.
The fuel pins will be made of the Ti-modified alloys containing rare-
earth additions as described in Subtask 1.1.1.1. The fuel pin design
will be modified to incorporate small sheet samples for Auger spectros-
copy. The experiment will run for 1 cycle (1100 hr) in the ORR.

2.4.10.3 Subtask 1.1.6.3 TeGen-3

The design of capsule TeGen-3 will likely be the same as that for TeGen-2.
It will contain samples from the large 10,000-1b 2% Ti-modified heat. The
exposure time will be two cycles (+2200 hr).

2.4.10.4 Subtask 1.1.6.4 TeGen-4

The purpose of this experiment will be to evaluate the cracking tendencies
of modified compositions of Hastelloy N under different conditions. The
design will be similar to TeGen-2, and the operating time will be 6 cycles
(v6600 hr). The most attractive alloys available will be included in this
experiment, and its purpose will be to evaluate the resistance of these
materials to intergranular cracking over long periods of time.

2.4.10.5 Subtask 1.1.6.5 TeGen-5

The purpose of this experiment will be to evaluate the cracking tendencies
of modified compositions of Hastelloy N under different conditions. The
design will be similar to TeGen-2, and the materials and operating con-
ditions will be selected on the basis of results from the development
program.

2.4.10.6 Subtask 1.1.6.6 TeGen-6

The purpose of this experiment will be to evaluate the cracking tendencies
of modified compositions of Hastelloy N under different conditions. The
design will be similar to TeGen-2, and the materials and operating con~
ditions will be selected on the basis of results from the development
program.

2.4.11 Task 1.1.7 Irradiation embrittlement of Hastelloy N

Exposure for 1 cycle (1100 hr) in the poolside facility of the ORR is
sufficient to transmute about half of the 0B normally present in
Hastelloy N to He. This is adequate exposure for evaluation relative
to performance in an MSBR. Specimens suitable for tensile and creep
tests will be irradiated at controlled temperatures after which they
2-32

will be removed from the irradiation capsule and subjected to post-
irradiation creep tests. Creep data will be recorded in a manner such
that adequate information will be available to assess the effects of
irradiation on creep behavior, the stress-rupture behavior, and the
fracture strain. Creep tests will alsc be run on unirradiated specimens.
These tests will allow one to distinguish the effects of thermal treat-
ment history and irradiation.

Some tube burst specimens will be run in which the specimens are irradi-
ated and stressed simultaneously. The time to rupture will be measured
directly from the test, and the rupture strain will be determined from
postirradiation measurements.

Microstructure is very imporant in determining the mechanical properties
of modified Hastelloy N, particularly in the irradiated condition. The
microstructure will be characterized by several electron optic techniques.
Facilities exist for the examination of both unirradiated and irradiated
samples.

2.4.11.1 Subtask 1.1.7.1 ORR irradiation of tensile specimens

 

The various heats of modified Hastelloy N will be irradiated in the CORR

to study their embrittlement during thermal neuton irradiation via

helium formation resulting from the transmutation of 108 and nickel.

The experiments will normally be operated for 1 cycle to a peak thermal
fluence of 3 x 1020 peutrons/em?. Irradiation temperature is an important
variable and will be varied from 1050 to 1400°F. The current design for
this experiment consists of 32 individually-heated positions, each con-
taining 2 or 3 specimens. About six experiments of this type will be

run in this subtask.

2.4.11.2 Subtask 1.1.7.2 Post irradiation creep tests

 

The samples irradiated in Subtask 1.1.7.1 will be creep tested to determine
the influence of irradiation on the mechanical properties. The samples
will be quite radioactive and these tests will be performed using creep
machines in the hot cells. Twelve machines currently exist for this pur-
pose. During these tests, stress, time, strain, and temperature will be
recorded. The data will be reduced analytically to strain-time plots

and various data correlations will be developed as required. About 500
tests of this type will be run.

2.4.,11.3 Subtask 1.1.7.3 Tube burst tests

 

The tensile specimens tested in Subtask 1.1.7.1 will be irradiated with-
out an applied stress and then subjected to peost-irradiation testing.

The work in this subtask involves tube burst tests which will be oper-
ated such that they are stressed and irradiated simultaneously. Although
postirradiation tests are adequate for most purposes, some stressed
 

ee)

in-reactor tests are needed. The specimens are pressurized internally
to provide the stress. The time to rupture is determined directly
during the test, and the fracture strain is measured after the experi-
ment is completed.

Tubing made from the 10,000-1b 2% Ti-modified heat will be available
late in FY 1975, and this material will be used for this work. Some
tubular material from other heats will be fabricated and one in-reactor
tube~burst experiment will be carried out.

2.4,11.4 Subtask 1.1.7.4 Control creep tests

 

Irradiation experiments subject specimens to neutron irradiation as well
as a period of thermal annealing. Each process can produce changes in
the mechanical properties, hence the effects must be separated in order
to evaluate the importance of each. The thermal annealing is approxzi-
mated by annealing unirradiated specimens at times and temperatures
equivalent to those encountered by specimens during irradiation. These
specimens will be creep tested and the results compared with those for
the irradiated samples. About 14 creep frames will be used for these
tests.

2.4.11.5 Subtask 1.1.7.5 Characterization of microstructure

 

The development of a modified Hastelloy N with improved resistance to
irradiation is based on developing a specific type of microstructure,

and continued study of microstructures is a very important part of this
program. Several analytical tools are used to characterize microstruc-
tures including transmission electrommicroscopy, extraction replication,
x-ray and electron diffraction, electron microprobe analysis, and opti-
cal metallography. Samples will be studied before and after irradiation
and after long periods of thermal exposure. The objective will be to
obtain an in-depth correlation of microstructure and mechanical behavior.
Variations from heat-to-heat will be correlated with chemical and process
variables.

2.5 TASK GROUP 1.2 PROCUREMENT OF COMMERCIAL HEATS

After an acceptable composition for modified Hastelloy N has been deter-
mined by the work in Task Group 1.1, at least four large commercial heats
(v10,000-1b) will be procured for evaluation. The specifications written
for the procurement of this material will form the basis for future pro-
curement. Orders for the four heats will be placed with at least two
vendors by competitive bidding. The material will be obtained in product
forms typically used in reactor construction. These materials will be
carefully catalogued and utilized extensively in Task Group 1.3.
2-34

2.5.1 OCbjective

The objective of this task is to obtain four large commercial heats of
the reference composition from two or more vendors for evaluation.

2.5.2 Schedule

The schedule for work on procurement of commercial heats is shown in
Table 2.5.2.

2.5.3 Funding

Operating fund requirements for Task Group 1.2 are shown in Table 2.5.3.
Capital equipment funds in the amount of $10,000 will be required in FY
1977 for storage facilities to be used in Task 1.2.4, Receipt and Cata-
loging of Materials.

2.5.4 Task 1.2.1 Specifications

The composition of the reference material will be fixed on the basis of
information developed in Task Group 1.1. Specifications will be written
that cover the allowable ranges for the important elements. These spec-
ifications will also cover melting practice and quality control proce-
dures for each product that will be produced.

2.5.5 Task 1.2.2 Bidding and vendor selection

 

The specifications will be submitted to several potential vendors for
consideration. Their respective quotations and their abilities to
satisfactorily prepare the materials will be considered, and purchase
orders will be placed with two or more vendors if possible.

2.5.6 Task 1.2.3 Surveillance of fabrication

Production of the four heats of material should develop adequate back-
ground information concerning the fabricability of this alloy. Fabri-
cation experience will be followed with each vendor and documented in

order that this information will be available to the MSR Program.

2.5.7 Task 1.2.4 Receipt and cataloging of material

The various product forms from the four commercial heats will be cata~
logued and made available for Task Group 1.3. The cataloging system
will be established so that all available processing information is
identified with the various product forms.

2.6 TASK GROUP 1.3 EVALUATION OF COMMERCIAL HEATS

The four large heats will be evaluated with respect to several properties a
including weldability, mechanical properties, compatibility with salt
containing fission products, and physical properties. These tests will
confirm the desirability of the composition selected and will provide
sufficient data for design of MSBR systems and components. Tests of

at least 10,000 hr duration will be required for design purposes. The
quality of testing will be maintained at a high level to provide infor-

mation with the precision necessary for design. i
2.6.1 Objective pe

The objective of this task is to determine the mechanical and physical
properties of the four reference heats and to demonstrate that the
properties observed in small heats can be reproduced in commercial heats.
Particular emphasis will be placed on evaluating the resistance of the
commercial heats to neutron embrittlement and tellurium-induced inter-

granular cracking. ii

2.6.2 Schedule i

The schedule for work in Task Group 1.3, Evaluation of Commercial Heats,
is shown in Table 2.6.2.

2.6.3 Funding

Operating fund requirements for Task Group 1.3 are given in Table
2.6.3.1, and capital equipment fund requirements are given in Table
2.6.3.2. GPP funds in the amount of $300,000 will be required in FY
1976 for modification of the Mechanical Property Test Laboratory.

2.6.4 Facilities Gi

The facilities described in Subsection 2.4.4 will be used for this task
group; however, additional mechanical property test facilities will be
required. These facilities will be obtained through the purchase and
construction of additional equipment and through subcontracts.

2.6.5 Task 1.3.1 Weldability

Test welds will be made in many of the products from the four large heats. Ga
Structural welds are usually made under conditions of high restraint,

hence test welds will be made in which the two test plates to be joined

together are each welded to a steel plate. This will require that the wi
weld metal deform to accommodate the dimensional changes resulting from

differential heating and cooling. The as-welded plates will be examined
by dye penetrant and x-ray techniques. Bead samples will be cut from
the test welds for bending and evaluation by ASME, Section VIII guide-
lines. Welding procedures will be developed which optimize the ease of
welding and the mechanical properties of the weld.

It is likely that some postweld heat treatment will be needed to reduce
residual stresses. Welded samples will be subjected to various postweld
anneals and tested to determine the most desirable postweld heat treat-
ment. Welded samples will also be irradiated and subjected to post-
irradiation creep tests (Subtask 1.3.2.4). The results from unirradiated
and irradiated samples will be used to determine the postweld anneal to
be used in fabrication.

Weld samples will be subjected to sufficient mechanical property tests
to develop basic data for design purposes. Information such as short-
term stress-strain behavior, creep behavior, stress-rupture data, and
strain to failure will be determined.

2.6.6 Task 1.3.2 Mechanical property tests

The mechanical property tests in this task will provide the data required
for design purposes. The basic types of tests required will be short-term
tensile, creep, fatigue, some special tests, and some tests of all types
on irradiated samples. The test techniques must be advanced somewhat

over those used in Task Group 2.1 in order to obtain the required degree
of precision. Tests will be run on several products from all four heats
to establish scatter bands.

2.6.6.1 Subtask 1.3.2.1 Short-term tensile tests

Time-independent stress intensities are based on short-term tensile
tests. These tests will be run at several controlled strain rates and
will cover the temperature range of 75 to 1500°F. Tests will be rum

on many product forms of all four heats. Samples will be annealed for
various lengths of time and tensile tested to evaluate property changes.
The test matrices for the four heats will include about 500 tests.

2.6.6.2 Subtask 1.3.2.2 Fatigue tests

Fatigue tests will be run at several strain ranges and the time to
failure measured. The strain ranges and the temperatures studied will
be similar to those anticipated in service. Fatigue properties are
quite sensitive to surface conditions, hence the tests will be carried
out in a salt environment of known composition. Some tests will be rum
in salt containing tellurium. These tests will cover the temperature
range of 75 to 1500°F and strain ranges of 0.05 to 1% per cycle.

 

 
 

2-41

2.6.6.3 Subtask 1.3.2.3 Long-term creep

Creep tests of at least 10,000-hr duration will be required for the design
of a test reactor. These tests must be very precise so that they accu-
rately describe the strain-time behavior. The temperature range of con-
cern for time-dependent properties is about 1000 to 1400°F. Many of the
tests will be carried out in salt-fission product environments, and others
will be run in air. Some samples will be annealed prior to creep testing
to determine the influence of annealing on the creep behavior.

2.6.6.4 Subtask 1.3.2.4 Special tests

 

Several types of specialized tests will be necessary to characterize the
mechanical behavior of material from the four large heats. One such type
of testing will be combined creep and fatigue tests to develop a method
of summing life fractions to predict failure. Multiaxial stresses pose
another problem. Analytical methods exist for predicting behavior under
multiaxial stresses on the basis of uniaxial test data. However, some
testing must be done to confirm that these methods will apply tec modi-
fied Hastelloy N.

2.6.6.5 Subtask 1.3.2.5 Irradiation damage

 

Samples of the four heats will be irradiated in the ORR to thermal flu-
ences of about 3 x 102% neutrons/em? and at temperatures of 1000 to
1400°F. The metal conditions will include as-received, solution
annealed, welded, and welded and stress-relieved. Most of the samples
will be irradiated in the unstressed condition and subjected to post-
irradiation creep testing. These tests are necessary for determining
the creep behavior and measuring the rupture time and strain. About 8
ORR experiments will be completed, each containing about 100 samples.
These samples will be subjected to postirradiation short-term tensile
and creep tests.

Some in-reactor tube burst experiments will be operated in which tubular
samples will be stressed and irradiated simultaneously. The time to
failure will be measured during irradiation and the creep strain deter-
mined by postirradiation measurements. About 4 experiments of this type
will be carried out.

2.6.7 Task 1.3.3 Physical property measurements

The physical properties of most importance in design are the elastic
constants, thermal expansion, thermal conductivity, and electrical con-
ductivity. These properties have been measured for standard Hastelloy
N, but may be somewhat different for modified Hastelloy N. Physical
measurements will be carried out for the modified alloy in order to
provide the data required for design purposes.
2-42

2.6.7.1 Subtask 1.3.3.1 Thermal expansion

Thermal expansion is a very important design parameter. Dimensional
changes which occur as a result of temperature changes often lead to
stresses. Accurate thermal expansion data must be available on the mod-
ified alloy so that these stresses can be accurately predicted. Measure-
ments will be made on several products from all four large heats over the
temperature range of 75 to 1800°F. Particular note will be made of heat-
to~heat variations and of anisotropy in the various products.

2.6.7.2 Subtask 1.3.3.2 Thermal conductivity

Thermal conductivity is a necessary parameter for design purposes. This
property will be measured on all four heats over the temperature range
of 75 to 1800°F. Measurements will be made on welds and base metal.

2.6.7.3 Subtask 1.3.3.3 Electrical conductivity

Electrical conductivity is a very basic physical property. It will be
measured on all four heats over the temperature range of 75 to 1800°F.

2.6.8 Task 1.3.4 Thermal convection corrosion tests

Thermal convection loops will be fabricated using material from each of
the four heats. The loops will be used to circulate fuel and coolant
salts and will operate over the temperature range of 1000 to 1400°F.
Electrochemical probes will be installed in each loop to measure the
oxidation state and the concentrations of corrosion products. Removable
samples will be placed in each loop and removed periodically for weigh-
ing and visual examination.

2.6.9 Task 1.3.5 Forced convection corrosion tests

Thermal convection loops are a relatively inexpensive method of deter-
mining corrosion behavior. However, the salt flow velocity in a thermal
convection loop is only a few feet per minute as compared with velocities
up to 20 ft per second in an MSBR. These higher velocities can increase
the corrosion rate markedly over that observed in thermal convection
loops at the lower velocities. Thus, some corrosion testing must be done
in pumped systems at realistic flow rates. A versatile forced convection
loop facility of near standard design has been developed for material
tests of this type. The test facilities developed for loops FCL-2, -3,
-4, and -5 will be modified by refabricating all parts that contact the
salt from the new modified materials. Work in forced convection facil-
ities associated with this task (designated FCL-6, -7, -8, and -9) is
discussed in more detail in the following sections.

2.6.9.1 Subtask 1.3.5.1 FCL-6

The portions of this facility which contact salt will be fabricated
from one of the commercial heats of modified Hastelloy N. The facility
will be operated with fuel salt between the temperature limits of 1050
and 1300°F. The facility will be equipped with electrochemical probes
for measuring the USY/U"Y ratio, and will have provisions for removable
samples.

2.6.9.2 Subtask 1.3.5.2 FCL=7

The portions of this facility which contact salt will be fabricated

from a different commercisl heat of modified Hastelloy N from that used
in Subtask 1.3.5.1, The facility will be operated with fuel salt over
the temperature range of 1050 to 1300°F. After operating for about 6
months to establish a base-line corrosion rate, tellurium will be added
to the salt, and subsequent operation will be concerned with the behavior
of this element. The facility will be equipped with electrochemical
probes for measuring the U(III)/U(IV) ratio snd the tellurium ion con-
centration. The facility will have provisions for removable samples.

2.6.9.3 Subtask 1.3.5.3 FCL-8

The portions of this facility which contact salt will be fabricated from
the heat of modified Hastelloy N used to construct the facility for Sub-
task 1.3.5.1. The facility will be used to circulate coolant salt over
the temperature range of 1000 to 1300°F. Electrochemical probes will

be installed to measure the oxidation state and the concentrations of
impurities. The facility will have provisions for removable samples.

2.6.9.4 Subtask 1.3.5.4 FCL-9

 

The portions of this facility which contact salt will be fabricated from
the heat of modified Hastelloy N used to construct the facility for Sub-
task 1.3.5.1. The facility will be used to circulate coolant salt over
the temperature range of 1000 to 1300°F. Electrochemical probes will

be installed to measure the oxidation state and the concentrations of
impurities. The facility will have provisions for removable samples.

2.6.10 Task 1.3.6 In-reactor fueled capsule tests

In~reactor fueled capsule tests will be run to demonstrate the compati-
bility of the four heats of modified Hastelloy N with fissioning fuel
salt. The capsules will contain small tubes (v1/2 in. diam) filled with
well-characterized fuel salt. The tests will be operated for periods
ranging from 1 ORR cycle (6 weeks) to 1 year. The concentrations of
fissile material and the irradiation periods will be chosen so as to
produce quantities of fission products equal to those that would be
2-44

produced per unit area of metal surface in a commercial MSBR. The pins
will be examined after irradiation to determine the extent of intergran-

ular cracking if any. Pieces of

the tubes will be deformed after irra-

diation to determine whether cracks form under these severe conditions.
About 6 experiments, each containing 3 fuel pins, will be carried out.

2.7 TASK GROUP 1.4 DEVELOPMENT OF ANALYTICAL DESIGN METHODS —

ASME CODE CASE SUBMISSION

The data obtained in Task Group 1.3 will be analyzed and expressed in
analytical formats suitable for use by designers. Model tests will be
carried out as necessary to develop high-temperature design methods.
The data and the design methods will be used for preparing a high-—

temperature ASME Pressure Vessel

The schedule for work in this task group is shown in Table 2.7.2.

2.7.3 Funding

Operating fund requirements for this task group are shown in Table
2.7.3. Capital equipment funds will be required in the amounts of
$50,000 and $100,000 during FY 1977 and FY 1978 respectively for work
related to the development of analytical design methods.

2.7.4 Facilities

It is quite likely that some model testing will be necessary for this
task group. Models of complex geometry will be stressed and the defor-
mation compared with that predicted analytically. This will be carried
out in the mechanics laboratory in Bldg. 9204-1. The other work will
be largely analytical in nature and will make extensive use of the

UCC-ND computing facilities.

2.7.5 Task 1.4.1 Data analysis

 

Large amounts of mechanical property data will be generated in Task Group
1.3. These data will be analyzed in detail and analytical expressions

developed for use by designers.

will be developed for (1) stress-strain behavior as a function of tem-
perature and strain rate, (2) stress-rupture behavior as a function of
temperature, (3) strain-time behavior as a function of temperature and
stress level, (4) fatigue response in the form of cycles to failure as

a function of strain range at various temperatures, and (5) cumulative
damage relationships for adding fatigue and creep damage. The expressions
will reflect the data spread due to heat-to-heat variations and experi-
mental uncertainties. Criteria will be developed for discarding erro-
neous data.

2.7.6 Task 1.4.2 Development of design methods

 

Design methods will be developed for designing complex systems constructed
of modified Hastelloy N. These methods will likely be patterned after the
existing high-temperature design code cases for type 304 and 316 stainless
steel. The test results from Task 1.3.2 will be used in developing design
methods specifically for modified Hastelloy N. Combined analytical and
experimental methods will be used to develop design methods for complex
stress histories. The initial analytical methods will be those currently
being developed for types 304 and 316 stainless steel. Model tests will
then be run to confirm that the methods developed for the austenitic
stainless steels can be used for Hastelloy N. One such type of loading

is multigxial stresses. Analytical methods exist for predicting creep
behavior under multiaxial stresses on the basis of uniaxial test data.
Scaled models of actual reactor components will be subjected to multi-
axial stresses and the resulting creep behavior measured. Model tests
will also be carried out to assist in the development of methods for
summing creep and fatigue damage.

The product of this task will be the development of analytical expressions
(with appropriate rules for their use) for designing MSBR components.

2.7.7 Task 1.4.3 Submission of code case

After adequate data are obtained and design methods established, a code
case will be submitted to the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Committee.
This case will officially establish the design rules as being accept-
able for use of modified Hastelloy N in nuclear service. A period of
6 months to 1 year will likely be required for approval after the case
is submitted. During this time it is quite likely that numerous ques~-
tions will arise concerning the submitted materiagl. Information will be
provided and some further analytical development work may be required.

2.8 TASK GROUP 1.5 LONG-TERM MATERIALS TESTS
Development of MSR's will involve a progression of reactors, each impos-

ing more demanding operation conditions. Task Groups 2.1 through 2.4
are aimed at obtaining materials data that are adequate for design of

i
es

2-47

the molten-salt test reactor (Section 14); however, additional long term
materials data will be required for design of subsequent reactors.

2.8.1 Objective

The objective of this task is to obtain long-term compatibility and
mechanical property data on modified Hastelloy N.
2.8.2 Schedule

Work on all tasks in this task group will be carried out continuously
during the period FY 1979 through FY 1985.

2.8.3 Funding

Operating fund requirements for this task group are summarized in Table
2.8.3.1, and capital equipment fund requirements are given in Table
2.8.3.2.

2.8.4 Facilities
This task will make use of most of the facilities described in Subsection

2.4.4,

2.8.5 Task 1.5.1 Mechanical property tests

 

Creep tests of 10,000 hr duration were run in subtask 1.3.2.3. Many of
these tests will be continued for times up to 50,000 hrs {v6 yr). Tests
of this duration are required to ensure that the material is structurally
stable for times within a factor of 5 of the anticipated operating life-
time of a reactor. Some of these tests will be run in salt-tellurium
environments so that the effects of this environment on the creep be-
havior can be assessed. It is likely that 16 long-term creep tests will
be run in salt and 14 will be run in air.

Some postirradiation creep tests will be continued for times up to
50,000 hr. These tests will define the strain-time behavior of the
irradiated modified material at low stresses comparable to those used

in reactor design. It is likely that about 12 long-term postirradiation
creep tests will be run.

2.8.6 Task 1.5.2 Forced circulation loops

The forced convection loops described in Task 1.3.5 will continue oper-
ation for 50,000 hours. Those loops were constructed of two heats of

modified Hastelloy N and two will circulate fuel salt and two will cir-
culate coolant salt, The first 10,000 hours of operation will provide
adequate information for design of a molten-salt test reactor (Section
14), but the additional 40,000 hr operation will be very useful for
future reactor operation. These four loops will have removable cor-
rosion samples, salt sampling and addition capabilities, and probes for
on-line chemical analyses. Continued operation of these loops will pro-
vide valuable information on corrosion behavior.

2.8.7 Task 1.5.3 In-reactor fueled capsule tests

 

At least four fuel pins will be placed in the ORR for long-term operation.
These pins will be designed similar to those described in Task 1.3.6.

The fuel pins will be fabricated from tubes of the four heats of modified
Hastelloy N. Fuel enrichment, irradiation temperature, and irradiation
time will be the variables. Operation of one capsule will be terminated
each year so that exposure times of 1, 2, 3, and 4 years will result for
the capsules. The pins will be examined after irradiation to determine
the extent of intergranular cracking, if any. Pieces of the tubes will
be deformed after irradiation to determine whether cracks form under
these conditions.

2.9 TASK GROUP 1.6 MATERIAL OPTIMIZATION

Although it is expected that the alloy resulting from work in Task Groups
1.1 through 1.5 will be adequate for construction of a molten-salt test
reactor (Section 14), a demonstration reactor (Section 15), and commer-
cial power reactors, it is likely that further alloy development will
lead to materials which have improved characteristics and may allow a
relaxation of design or operating constraints. Attention will also be
given to the use of cheaper, more available materials for construction
of power reactors.

2.9.1 Objective

The objective of this task is to develop structural materials for the
MSBR primary circuit that are superior to the alloy developed in Task
Groups 1.1 through 1.5. It is important that these improved materials
be pursued for future applications.

2.9.2 Schedule

Work on all tasks in this task group will be carried out continuously
during the period of FY 1979 through FY 1985.
2-50

2.9.3 Funding

Operating fund requirements for this task group are summarized in Table
2.9.3.1, and capital equipment fund requirements are shown in Table
2.9.3.2.

2.9.4 Facilities

This task will make use of the same facilities as required for Task wi
Group 1.3.

2.9.5 Task }.6.1 Further Hastelloy N improvement

 

It is likely that the modified Hastelloy N developed in Task Groups 1.1

through 1.5 will have a maximum service temperature between 1300 and EE
1400°F. This upper limit is set by the temperature at which the carbide

precipitates coarsen and resistance to neutron embrittlement decreases

sharply. It weuld be desirable to develop a material which has a higher

temperature limit so that higher temperature transients could be accom-

modated. Improvement of modified Hastelloy N can likely be effected by

additional chemical modifications.

2.9.6 Task 1.6.2 Consideration of other materials

 

Other potential materials for the MSBR primary circuit offer several
advantages over Hastelloy N, but have not been investigated sufficiently
to define their limitations. For example, the austenitic stainless steels
offer the advantages of lower cost, easier fabricability, and excellent
resistance tc intergranular cracking by tellurium, but it is not clear
what operating conditions (temperature, U3t/u*t ratio) must be maintained
in order to obtain an acceptable corrosion rate. Inconel 600 and several
similar alloys contain 15 te 20% Cr. The chromium offers improved resis-
tance to embrittlement by tellurium, but will also increase the corrosion
rate. The operating conditions will be defined for which the corrosion ga
rate of these materials is acceptable. If the resulting operating con-

ditions warrant further study, additional development work will be done

on these materials. Gi

3. FUEL PROCESSING

3.1 INTRODUCTION

3.1.1 Objective

The objective of this activity is the development of technology necessary
for the design of a processing system for a 1000-MW(e) MSBR, and for
estimating the system performance, reliability, and costs.

3.1.2 Scope

The scope of this activity includes development and analysis of process—
ing plant flowsheets; study of the chemistry on which process operations
are based; and design and operation of engineering experiments and facil-
ities required for developing the necessary fuel processing technology.

3.1.2.1 Task Group 2.1 Flowsheet analysis

 

As promising flowsheets are developed, existing computer codes will be
used and new codes will be developed, when necessary, to determine the
feasibility of the flowsheets and to identify proper operating conditions.
This task group covers heat and mass balance calculations, parametric

and optimization studies, waste characterization, processing plant cost
estimates, processing plant control studies, and identification of
alternate processes.

3.1.2.2 Task Group 2.2 Continuous fluorinator development

This task group is directed to the development of technology required for
the removal of uranium from fuel salt by fluorination. The work includes
development of heat sources for nonradicactive tests, fluorination chem~
istry, frozen wall corrosion protection studies, hydrodynamic and mass
transfer studies, and the design and operation of experimental facilities
for engineering studies of fluorination. This task group interfaces with
Task Group 2.3 in the Fluorination-Reconstitution Engineering Facility.

3.1.2.3 Task Group 2.3 Fuel reconstitution

 

This task group is directed to the development of technology required

for recombination of uranium removed in the fluorination step with the
processed fuel salt before its return to the reactor; this is accomplished
by absorbing the UFg into salt containing UF, to produce soluble UFs, and
subsequently reducing the UFg to UF, with hydrogen. This task group covers
investigations of the chemistry of the reconstitution process, engineering
studies for process development, and the design and operation of a com-
bined fluorination-reconstitution facility. This task group interfaces
with Task Group 2.2 in the Fluorination-Reconstitution Engineering
Facility.

3.1.2.4 Task Group 2.4 Protactinium removal

Protactinium-233 must be isolated and allowed to decay to 233y outside the
reactor in order to avoid an undesirable decrease in breeding performance.
The present flowsheet calls for extracting 233pa from the fuel salt into
molten bismuth containing dissolved reductant. This task group includes
development of salt-metal contactors for performing the extraction, de-
velopment of continuous hydrofluorinators and hydrochlorinators for salt-
bismuth systems, operation of a continoucus Reductive Extraction Process
Facility for carrying out engineering studies of the process, and the
design, construction, and operation of an experiment to demonstrate iso-
lation of protactinium using 231lps, This task group interfaces with

Task Group 2.5 in the development of salt-bismuth contactors.

3.1.2.5 Task Group 2.5 Rare-—earth removal

The present flowsheet calls for removal of rare earths from the fuel salt
using the metal transfer process. This task group covers the development
of salt-bismuth contactors, operation of Metal Transfer Experiment MTE-3B,
and design, construction, and operation of a facility for engineering
studies of the metal transfer process using flow rates which are about
10% of those required in a 1000-MW(e) MSBR.

3.1.2.6 Task Group 2.6 Fuel salt purification

Before fuel salt is returned to the reactor from the processing plant

the oxidation potential of the fuel salt must be adjusted to a proper
level and traces of bismuth and corrosion products must be removed. This
task group covers development of processes for continuously adjusting the
oxidation potential by means of measuring and controlling the [ot1/[ut3)
ratio in the fuel salt, and the development of processes for removing
entrained and dissolved bismuth from the fuel salt.

3.1.2.7 Task Group 2.7 Actinide-fission product separation and
actinide recycle

The actinides constitute a long-term waste hazard and it is desirable to
develop means for recycling them for transmutation to less undesirable
isotopes in the reactor. This task group covers the studies of the
necessary chemistry for separating actinides from fission products to
allow actinide recycle, the development and analysis of flowsheets for
implementing these types of processes, and the identification of the
required engineering development activities. This task group interfaces
with Task Group 2.1 in the development and analysis of flowsheets.

This task group covers the design (conceptual, Title I, and Title II},
construction, and acceptance testing for a general laboratory facility
in which large engineering development work can be carried cut. The
facility will be used for a number of engineering studies related to
processing MSBR fuel.

3.1.2.9 Task Group 2.9 Integrated Process Test Facility

The several process steps must be combined in an integrated pilot plant
which would demonstrate the operability of a fuel processing system
using flow rates that are 50 to 75% of those required for a 1000-MW(e)
MSBR in a nonradioactive system. This task group covers the preliminary
design, the development work required for final design, the design {(con-
ceptual, Title I and Title II), equipment construction and installation,
the initial testing and operator training, and the operation of the
Integrated Process Test Facility.

processing technology include the design, construction, and operation

of a processing system in the Molten-Salt Test Reactor Mock-up (Section
13}, the design, construction, and operation of a processing plant to be
operated in conjunction with the Molten—Salt Test Reactor (Section 14},
and the design, construction, and operation of a processing plant for in-

3.3 REQUIREMENTS, BACKGROUND, AND STATUS OF DEVELOPMENT

3.3.1 Processing requirements

 

Operation of a molten-salt reactor as a high-performance breeder is made
possible by the continuous processing of the fuel salt in a facility that
is located at the reactor site. The most important operations consist

in removing fission products {principally the rare earths) and isolating
233pa from the region of high neutron flux during its decay to 233y in
order to hold neutron absorption in these materials to an acceptably low
level. It is also necessary that excess uranium produced in the system
be removed for sale, that the fuel salt be maintained at the proper redox
potential, and that the oxide and corrosion product concentrations in the
salt be maintained at tolerzble levels.

The rates at which the fuel salt must be processed for 233Pa removal and
rare-earth removal are mutually dependent. It will be convenient to de-
fine the term "processing cycle time" as the time required for processing
a volume of fuel salt equal to that contained in the reactor system. The
"removal time" for a given material is then an effective cycle time that
is equal to the processing cycle time divided by the fraction of the
material that is removed in a pass through the processing system. For

a particular single-fluid MSBR having a breeding ratio of 1.07, the re-
quired rare-earth removal time can range from 50 days for a protactinium
removal time of 3 days to about 11 days for a protactinium removal time
of 20 days. The optimum choice of protactinium and rare-earth removal
times is largely dependent on the characteristics of the processes em-
ployed. For example, the present rare-earth removal process requires
that protactinium be removed from the salt prior to the removal of rare
earths. Hence, with this process, the rare-earth removal time will
always be as long as or longer than the protactinium removal time. A
protactinium removal time of 10 days and a rare-earth removal time of
about 27 days are used with the reference processing system.

3.3.2 Background

Processing of MSBR fuel salt is based principally on three types of
operations: removal of uranium from the salt by fluorination; the
selective removal of protactinium, rare earths, and other fission
products from the salt by extraction into molten bismuth; and the re-
combination of uranium with the processed salt by the hydrogen reduc-
tion of UFg to UF, in the presence of the processed fuel carrier salt.
In addition to these principal operations there is the necessity for
auxiliary support systems and operations required for close-coupled
fuel processing.

The chemical basis on which the processing system is founded is well
understood; however, only small engineering experiments have been carried
out to date and a considerable engineering development effort remains.

3.3.2.1 Removal of uranium from molten salts by fluorination

 

There is a considerable background and operating experience related to the
removal of uranium from molten fluoride mixtures by contact with elemental
fiuorine. Initial work in this area was related to the recovery of uranium
from the irradiated fuel salt of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment. The suc~-
cess of the development work led to formation of the Fused Salt Fluoride
Volatility Program at ORNL and operation of a pilot plant for batch fluori-
nation of the irradiated ARE fuel salt.22? Operation of the pilot plant was
highly successful, and upon completion of ARE fuel processing, laboratory
work was initiated for the development of a fuel element dissolution oper-
ation based on contact of fuel elements with hydrogen fluoride in the
presence of fused fluoride mixtures in order to extend the Volatility
Process to other reactor fuels. This work culminated in the highly suc~
cessful recovery of uranium from various irradiated zirconium—, aluminum~-,
and stainless steel-based fuels,?3 which in some cases were processed as
early as 30 days after fuel discharge.?“ Uranium recoveries greater than
99% and uranium decontamination factors in excess of 10° were consistently
demonstrated.

More recently the Fused Salt Fluoride Volatility Process was used for
removal of the 235U-238y mixture from the MSRE fuel salt at the MSRE

site after the reactor had operated for about 1.5 years.?® This opera-
tion was also highly successful, and the fuel carrier salt was subsequently
combined with 2330 and returned to the MSRE for an additional year of
operation.

While there are a number of differences between the experience gained
with the Fluoride Volatility Process and information required for con-
tinuous removal of uranium from MSBR fuel salt, the Volatility Process
experience indicates conclusively that uranium can be removed from a
variety of fused fluoride mixtures in essentially a quantitative manner,
and the broad experience on fission product behavicr, materials of con-
struction, and remote operation is directly applicable in many important
cases.

3.3.2.2 Recombination of UFg with processed fuel carrier salt

 

There is a vast experience in the high-temperature gas phase reduction
of UFg to UFy by contact with hydrogen, and this operation has been
successfully carried out in a number of uranium processing facilities.
Initially, attention was given to use of a scaled-down reduction reactor
of this type for recombining UFg with processed MSBR fuel carrier salt.
However, consideration of the difficulties associated with equipment
scale-down, UF; product collection and holdup, and remote operation
prompted a search for a more direct means for recombining UFg with
molten fluoride mixtures. The known interactions between UFg and UF,
in the absence of molten salt leading to the formation of slightly
volatile fluorides such as UFg, and -the observation that UFg is formed
during fluorination of molten fluorides containing UF,, suggested that

Am oe
3-10

UFg could be absorbed directly into molten salt that contained UF.
Subsequent experiments verified that the absorption reaction is rapid
and that UFg can be combined quantitatively with molten fluorides con-
taining UF, with the simultaneous formation of intermediate fluorides
having a low volatility.l

In the fuel reconstitution step, a gas stream containing UFg and F)
will be reacted with a recirculating salt stream containing dissolved
UF, according to the reactions

UF, (d) + 1/2F,(g) = UFg(d) (3.1)
and
UF, (4) + UFg (8) = 2UF: (4d) . (3.2)

The dissolved UFg will be reduced in a separate chamber according to
the reaction

UFs(d) + 1/2H,(g) = UF, (d) + HF(g) . (3.3) ws

Preliminary results! indicate that reaction (3.3) occurs more slowly
than reaction (3.2); however, the full significance of this in the fuel Li
reconstitution step is not known.

3.3.2.3 Distribution of metals between molten salts and bismuth

Bismuth is a low-melting (271°C) metal that is essentially immiscible

with molten halide mixtures consisting of fluorides, chlorides, and EE
bromides. The vapor pressure of bismuth in the temperature range of

interest (500 to 700°C) is negligible, and the solubilities of lithium,

thorium, uranium, protactinium, and most of the fission products are

adequate for processing applications.

Under the conditions of interest, reductive extraction reactioms be-
tween materials in salt and metal phases can be represented by the
following reaction:

MX (salt) + nLi(Bi) = M(Bi) + nLiX(salt) ,

in which the metal halide in the salt reacts with lithium from the
bismuth phase to produce M in the bismuth phase and the respective
lithium halide in the salt phase. The valence of M in the salt is +n,
and X represents fluorine, chlorine, and bromine. It has been found?
that the distribtution coefficient DU for metal M depends on the

 

lithium concentration in the metal phase (mole fraction, Xp 4) as a
follows:

log 2 =n log x. + log KL .
=]

 

ti

 

3-11
The quantity K * is dependent only on temperature, and the distribution
coefficient is defined by the relation:

_ mole fraction of M in metal phase
mole fraction of MX in salt phase

 

The ease with which one component can be separated from another is in-
dicated by the ratio of the respective distribution coefficients, that
is, the separation factor. As the separation factor approaches unity,
separation of the components becomes increasingly difficult. On the
other hand, the greater the deviation from unity, the easier the
separation.

Distribution data have been obtained? for a large number of elements,
including all of those of importance, between fuel salt (72-16-12 mole %
LiF-BeF,-ThFy) and bismuth. Under the expected process conditions, the
Pa~-Th separation factor is about 1200, which indicates that protactinium
as well as uranium and zirconium can be easily extracted from a salt
stream containing ThF,. However, the rare-earth--thorium separation
factors are close to unity (1.2 to 3.5), indicating that direct selective
extraction of the rare earths from a salt containing thorium fluoride
would be difficult. A previous rare-earth removal method was based on
these low separation factors and required a large number of stages, a
high metal-to-salt flow ratio, and a large electrolytic cell for provid-
ing thorium and rare-earth reflux at the ends of the extraction cascade
(ref. 3, pp. 170-78; ref. 4, pp. 52-77).

It was found subsequently that with LiCl or LiBr, much more favorable
thorium—-rare-earth separation factors are obtained (ref. 21, p. 285).
Distribution data for LiCl (ref. 5, p. 171;7) falls roughly into three
groups. The divalent rare-earth and alkaline-earth elements distribute
most readily to the LiCl, with thorium-~rare-earth separation factors of
about 108. The trivalent rare earths have thorium--rare-earth separation
factors of about 10%. Tetravalent materials, such as thorium and protac-—
tinium, distribute only slightly to LiCl. Studies on the temperature
dependence of the distribution data show essentially no effect for the
divalent elements, a minor effect for the trivalent elements, and a some-
what greater effect for the tetravalent elements. The distribution co-
efficient for thorium is decreased sharply by the addition of fluoride

to the LiCl, although the distribution coefficients for the rare earths
are affected by only a minor amount. Thus, contamination of the LiCl
with several mole percent fluoride will not affect the removal of the
rare earths but will cause a sharp increase in the thorium removal rate.
Data with LiBr® are similar to those with LiCl, and the distribution
behavior with LiCl-LiBr mixtures would likely not differ appreciably

from the data with the pure materials.

3.3.2.4 Protactinium removal system

The reference protactinium removal system (ref. 7, pp. 3-21) is based

on fluorination for uranium removal and reductive extraction for prot-
actinium isolation. Fuel salt containing 0.33 mole % UF, and approxi-
mately 0.0035 mole % PaF, is withdrawn from the reactor. About 99% of
the uranium is removed from the salt by fluorination in order to avoid
the use of large quantities of reductant in the subsequent protactinium
removal step. The salt stream is fed countercurrent to a bismuth stream
containing lithium and thorium, where the remaining uranium and the prot-
actinium transfer to the metal stream. These materials are transferred
from the bismuth to a captive secondary salt by hydrofluorinating the
bismuth stream leaving the extraction column in the presence of the
secondary salt. The secondary salt which flows through the hydrofluori-
nator alsc circulates through a fluorinator, where gbout 907 of the uran-
ium is removed, and through a tank that contains most of the protactinium.
Lithium is added to the bismuth leaving the hydrofluorinator, and the
resulting stream is returned to the top of the extraction column. The
salt leaving the extraction column is essentially free of uranium and
protactinium but contains the rare earths at essentially the reactor
concentration. This stream is fed to the rare-earth removal system.

3.3.2.5 Rare-earth removal process

In the reference rare-earth removal system (ref. 8, pp. 1-15) fuel salt,
which is free of uranium and protactinium but contains the rare earths,
is countercurrently contacted with bismuth containing reductant in order
to extract a significant fraction of the rare earths into the bismuth.
The bismuth stream, which contains the rare earths and thorium, is then
countercurrently contacted with lithium chloride. Because of highly
favorable distribution coefficients, significant fractions of the rare
earths transfer to the LiCl along with a negligible amount of thorium.
The final steps of the process consist in extracting the rare earths
from the LiCl by contact with bismuth having lithium concentrations

of 5 and 50 at. Z%.

This prccess has a number of very desirable characteristics. Of primary
importance is the fact that there is no net consumption of reductant in
the two upper contactors. The process is not sensitive to minor vari-
ations in operating conditions. Essentially no materials other than the
rare-earth and alkaline-earth elements are removed from or added to the
fuel salt; the major change consists in replacing the extracted rare
earths with an equivalent amount of lithium as LiF. The amount of LiF
added to the fuel salt in this manner during 30 years of operation would
be less than 10% of the LiF inventory in the reactor.

3.3.2.6 Conceptual processing plant flowsheet

The reference processing flowsheet (ref. 7, pp. 3-21) is shown in Fig.
3.1. Fuel salt is withdrawn from the reactor on a 10-day cycle; for a
1000-MW(e) reactor, this represents a flow rate of (0.88 gpm. The fluo-
rinator removes 997 of the uranium. The protactinium extraction con-
tactor is equivalent to five equilibrium stages. The bismuth flow rate
through the contactor is 0.13 gpm, and the inlet thorium concentration
in the stream is 90% of the thorium solubility at the operating tempera-
ture of 640°C. The protactinium decay tank has a volume of 160 ft3. The
uranium inventory in the tank is less than 0.2% of that in the reactor.
Fluorides of lithium, thorium, zirconium, and nickel accumulate in the
tank at a total rate of about 0.1 ft3/day. These materials are removed
by periodic withdrawal of salt to a final protactinium decay and fluori-
nation operation.

The bismuth flow rate through the two upper contactors in the rare-earth
removal system is 12.5 gpm, and the LiCl flow rate is 33 gpm. Each con-
tactor is equivalent to three equilibrium stages.

The trivalent and divalent rare earths are removed in separate contactors
in order to minimize the amount of lithium required. Only 2% of the LiCl,
or 0.66 gpm, is fed to the two-stage divalent rare-earth removal contactor,
where it is contacted with a 0.58-gal/day bismuth stream containing 50 at.
#Z lithium. The trivalent stripper, where the LiCl is contacted with bis-
muth containing 5 at. 7 lithium, is equivalent to one equilibrium stage.

The bismuth stream containing the reductant necessary for the isolation
of protactinium is actually fed to the recirculating bismuth stream in the
rare-earth removal system. An equivalent amount of bismuth is withdrawn
from the stream and is fed to the protactinium isolation column. This
allows for more nearly complete extraction of the protactinium and pro-
vides a means for removing materials which might otherwise accumulate in
the recirculating stream.

The remaining steps in the flowsheet consist in combining the processed
salt with uranium and purifying the resulting fuel salt. The uranium
addition is accomplished by absorbing the UFg-F, stream from the fluori-
nators into fuel salt containing UF,, which results in the formation of
soluble UFg. The UF; is then reduced to UF, by contact with hydrogen.
The HF resulting from reduction of UFg is electrolyzed in order to recycle
the contained fluorine and hydrogen. These materials are recycled in
order to avoid waste disposal charges on the material that would be pro-
duced if the HF were absorbed in an aqueous solution of KOH.? The salt
will be contacted with nickel wool in the purification step in order to
ensure that the final bismuth concentration is acceptably low.

The protactinium removal time obtained with the flowsheet is 10 days, and
the rare-earth removal times range from 17 to 51 days, with the rare earths
of most importance being removed on 27- to 30-day cycles. Calculations
(ref. 7, pp. 3-21; ref. 8, pp. 1-15) indicate that the flowsheet is rela-
tively insensitive to minor variations in operating conditions, such as

changes in temperature, flow rates, reductant concentrations, etc. It

was noted earlier, however, that the thorium--rare-earth separation

factor decreases sharply as the concentration of fluoride in the LiCl

is increased; contamination of the LiCl would result from entrainment

of fuel salt by the bismuth stream leaving the upper contactor. The
effect is largely an increase in the rate at which thorium is removed
with the rare earths. The thorium removal rate increases from about

0.4 mole/day with no fluoride in the LiCl to about 280 moles/day when
the LiCl contains the equivalent of 5 mole %Z LiF. It appears that the
fluoride concentration in the LiCl could economically be as high as

2 mole %, which corresponds to a thorium discard rate of 7.7 moles/day.
Discard of thorium at this rate would add only about 0.0013 mill/kWhr to
the power cost; however, the presence of thorium in the resultant waste
complicates waste disposal considerations. The effect of fluoride in
the LiCl on the removal of rare earths is negligible. In fact, the
rare-earth removal efficiency increases slightly as the fluoride concen-
tration in the LiCl increases. In addition, contact of LiCl containing
fluoride with volatile BiClj results in formation of volatile BF3 (ref.
10, p. 106), and thus fluoride can be removed from LiCl easily by this
means.

The reliable removal of decay heat from the processing plant is an impor-
tant consideration because of the relatively short decay time before the
salt enters the processing plant. A total of about 6 MW of heat would be
produced in the processing plant for a 1000-MW(e) MSBR. Since molten bis-
muth, fuel salt, and LiCl are not subject to radiolytic degradation, there
is not the usual concern encountered with processing of short-decayed fuel.

3.3.3 Status of development

 

3.3.3.1 Continuous fluorinator development

 

Studies have been carried out previously}?! on fluorination of molten salt

in a l1-in.~diam, 72-in.-long nickel fluorinator that allowed countercurrent
contact of molten salt with fluorine. In these tests, molten salt (41-24-35
mole % NaF-LiF-ZrF,) containing UF, was countercurrently contacted with a
quantity of fluorine in excess of that required for the conversion of UF,

to UFg. Experiments were carried out with temperatures ranging from 525 to
600°C, UF, concentrations in the feed salt ranging from 0.12 te 0.35 mole ¥%,
and a range of salt and fluorine feed rates. The fraction of the uranium
removed from the salt ranged from 97.5% to 99.9%.

Axial dispersion in the salt phase will be important in the design of
continuous fluorinators, and gas holdup and axial dispersion have been
measured in columns having diameters ranging from 1 to 6 in. using air
and aqueous solutions. Data were obtained for wide ranges of viscosity,
surface tension, and superficial gas velocity. Correlations for gas
holdup and axial dispersion were developed? which are believed to be
applicable to countercurrent contact of molten salt and fluorine in a
continuous fluorinator. These correlations and the data on uranium
3-16

removal in the l-in.-diam continuous fluorinator were used for estimating
the performance of larger diameter continuous fluorinators (ref. 12,
p. 41).

The combination of molten salt and fluorine results in a highly corrosive
environment, and it will be necessary to protect a continuous fluorinator
from corrosion by maintaining a layer of frozen salt on surfaces that a
would otherwise contact both molten salt and fluorine. Use of a frozen
salt layer for preventing the dissolution of nickel fluoride from a
nickel surface will allow passivation of the nickel to occur.

The feasibility of maintaining frozen salt layers in gas-salt contactors
was demonstrated previously® in tests in a 5-in.~diam, 8~ft-high simu-
lated fluorinator in which molten salt (66-34 mole Z LiF~ZrF,) and argon w=
were countercurrently contacted. An internal heat source in the molten

region was provided by Calrod heaters contained in a 3/4~in.-diam pipe

along the center line of the vessel. A frozen salt layer was maintained a
in the system with equivalent volumetric heat generation rates of 10 to

55 Kw/ft®, For comparison, the heat generation rates in fuel salt immed-
iately after removal from the reactor and after passing through vessels
having holdup times of 5 and 30 min are 57, 27, and 12 kW/fe3, respectively.

Operation of a continuous fluorinator with nonradicactive salt requires

a means for generating heat in the molten salt that is not subject to a
corrosion. Radio-frequency induction heating was studied in fluorinator

simulations using nitric acid!3 and auto-resistance heating using 60-Hz

power with molten salt (65-35 mole % LiF-BeF,) was studied in a 6-in.-diam as
fluorinator simulator.!* Autoresistance heating is the preferred method,
since it can be used over a wider range of operating conditions and since
the electrical power supply is much simpler than that required for induc-
tion heating.

3.3.3.2 Fuel reconstitution di

Studies of the absorption of UFg by MSBR fuel carrier salt containing UF,

have been carried out.l* Absorption of UFg in fuel carrier salt contain- a
ing UF, has been shown to result in the formation of soluble nonvolatil-~

UFs according to the following reaction:

UFg(g) + UF, (d) = 2UF5(d) ,
in which (g) denotes gas and (d) denotes species dissolved in the salt.

The recent studies have also shown that gaseous hydrogen .eacts with as
dissolved UFg according to the reactions:

2UF5(d) + Hy(g) = 2UF,(d) + 2HF(g) .

Since both UFg and UFg are strong oxidants, the initial experiments were
conducted primarily to find a material that was inert to these species.

 
3-17

It was found that at 600°C, nickel, copper, and graphite are not suffi-
ciently inert but that gold is stable both to gaseous UFg and to salt
containing up to 6 wt XZ UF5;. Consequently, current studies are being
conducted in gold apparatus. Future experiments will be carried out
with UFg-F, mixtures in order to determine the effect of the presence
of fluorine in the gas stream. The behavior of the fluorides of iodine
and neptunium in this step will also be determined.

Results from several experiments show that UFs undergoes gas phase dis-
proportionation to UFg and UF,. The studies also indicate that the
solubility of UFg in the salt is low. Engineering experiments are being
designed for further study of the absorption of UFg-F, mixtures in molten
salt containing UF, and the subsequent reduction of UF by contact of the
salt with hydrogen.

3.3.3.3 Protactinium removal

 

A salt-bismuth reductive extraction facility has been operated success-
fully in which uranium and zirconium were extracted from salt by counter-
current contact with bismuth containing reductant (ref. 7, pp. 64-89;
ref. 14). More than 95% of the uranium was extracted from the salt by

a 0.82-in.~diam, 24-in.-long packed column. The inlet uranium concen~-
tration in the salt was about 25% of the uranium concentration in the
reference MSBR. These experiments represent the first demonstration of
reductive extraction of uranium in a flowing system. Information on the
rate of mass transfer of uranium and zirconium has also been obtained in
the system using an isotopic dilution method, and HTU values of about
4.5 ft were obtained,

Correlations have been developed (ref. 15, pp. 102-17; ref. 12) for floed-
ing and dispersed-phase holdup in packed columns during countercurrent
flow of liquids having high densities and a large difference in density,
such as salt and bismuth. These correlations, which have been verified

by studies with molten salt and bismuth (ref. 7, pp. 64-89), were developed
by study of countercurrent flow of mercury and water or high-density
organics and water in 1- and 2-in.-diam columns packed with solid cylinders
and Raschig rings varying in size from 1/8 to 1/2 in. Data on axial dis-
persion in the continuous phase during the countercurrent flow of high-
density liquids in packed columns has also been obtained (ref. 16, pp.
58-89; ref. 17), and a simple relation for predicting the effects of

axial dispersion on column performancel® has been developed.

The successful operation of salt-metal extraction columns is dependent
upon the availability of a bismuth-salt interface detector. The success-
ful operation of an eddy-current-type interface detector that consists of
a ceramic form on which bifilar primary and secondary coils were wound
was demonstrated recently.“ Contact of the coils with molten salt or
bismuth is prevented by enclosing the element in a molybdenum tube.
Passage of a high-frequency alternating current through the primary

coil induces a current in the secondary coil whose magnitude is depen-
dent on the conductivities of the adjacent materials; since the conduc~
tivities of bismuth and salt are quite different, the induced current
3-18

reflects the presence or absence of bismuth. The detector appears to be
a practical and sensitive indicator of either salt-bismuth interface
location or bismuth level.

Because column-type contactors will be expensive to build and because of
the likelihood of entraining bismuth into the fuel salt and introducing

it into the reactor, a mechanically agitated contactor in which the a
phases are relatively mildly agitated and are not dispersed is being

considered. Most of the experimental work reported in the literature

for this type contactor has been done with partially miscible solvent- i
water systems that produce Reynolds numbers almost an order of magnitude
lower than those expected in salt-bismuth systems. The variables of
greatest significance in correlating mass transfer rates in this type
contactor are believed to be the surface tension and the kinematic vis-
cosity (u/p). These properties of the mercury-water system are close

to the same properties of molten salt-bismuth systems, and experiments
were carried out for determining mass transfer coefficients with the Es
mercury-water system in order to verify the applicability of reported
mass transfer correlations to salt-bismuth systems. The mass transfer
performance of this type of contactor is strongly dependent on cell
geometry, and tests were carried out using rectangular contactors having
cross sectional areas as large as 1 ft2. Agitators having a range of
diameters and paddle characteristics were used. In the tests, the rate
of transfer of lead from dilute Pb(NO3), solutions into a zinc-mercury
amalgam was measured and the mass transfer rates were compared with
literature correlations. Although all literature correlations reproduced

the aqueous-organic data fairly well, they did not correlate the mass
transfer data from the water-mercury system. A correlation was developed

which correlates the aquecus-organic data of others as well as the water-

mercury data. A 6-in.-diam contactor was installed in the flow-through i
reductive extraction facility in place of the packed column contactor
previcusly used in order to obtain additional mass transfer coefficient
data. The mass transfer rates observed in the salt-bismuth system are
higher than those predicted by the recently developed correlation.

Design and development work has been initiated on a Reductive Extraction

Process Facility!" that will allow operation of the important steps for E
the reductive extraction process for protactinium isolation. The facility
will allow countercurrent contact of salt and bismuth streams in various
types of contactors at flow rates as high as about 25% of those required
for processing a 1000-MW(e) MSBR. The facility will operate continuously
and will allow measurement of mass transfer and hydrodynamic data under
steady-state conditions.

 

3.3.3.4 Rare-earth removal

An engineering experiment was carried out which demonstrated all aspects
of the metal transfer process!? for the removal of rare earths. The
equipment consisted of a 6-in.-diam compartmented vessel in which were
present about 1 liter each of MSBR fuel carrier salt, bismuth saturated
3-19

with thorium, and LiCl. The fluoride salt initially contained 147NdF,
at the tracer level and LaF; at a concentration of 0.04 mole fraction.
During the experiment, the rare earths were selectively extracted into
the LiCl along with a negligible amount of thorium. Provision was made
for circulating the LiCl through a chamber containing bismuth having a
lithium concentration of 38 at. 7, where the rare earths and thorium
were removed. The distribution ratios for the rare earths remained
constant during the experiment at about the expected values. About 50%
of the neodymium and about 70% of the lanthanum were collected in the
Li-Bi solution. The final thorium concentration in the Li-Bi solution
was below 5 ppm, making the ratio of rare earths to thorium in the Li-Bi
greater than 10° times the initial concentration ratio in the fuel salt
and thus demonstrating the selective removal of rare earths from a
fluoride salt containing thorium.

A larger metal transfer experiment (ref. 19, pp. 254-55; ref. 20, pp.
209-12; ref. 14) has been operated that used salt and bismuth flow rates
that were about 1% of the values required for processing a 1000-MW(e)
MSBR, and the preliminary design has been carried out for an experiment
that will use a three-stage salt-metal contactor and flow rates that are
5 to 10% of those required for a 1000-MW(e) MSBR. 1 *

3.3.3.5 Bismuth removal and uranium valence adjustment

In a processing plant, the fuel salt will be contacted with bismuth con-
taining reductant in order to remove protactinium and the rare earths.
It will be necessary that entrained or dissolved bismuth be removed from
the salt before it is returned to the reactor, since nickel is quite
soluble in bismuth (about 10 wt %) at the reactor operating temperature.
Efforts to measure the solubility of bismuth in salt have indicated

that the solubility is lower than about 1 ppm, and the expected solu~
bility of bismuth in the salt is very low under the highly reducing
conditions that will be used. For these reasons, it is believed that
bismuth can only be present at significant concentrations in the salt

as entrained metallic bismuth.

In order to characterize the bismuth concentration likely to be present
in the salt after it is contacted with bismuth, we have done periodic
sampling of salt in engineering experiments involving contact of salt
and bismuth. The results indicated that the bismuth concentration in
the salt in most cases ranges from 10 to 100 ppm after countercurrent
contact of the salt and bismuth in a packed-column contactor; however,
concentrations below 1 ppm are observed in salt leaving a stirred-
interface salt-metal contactor in which the salt and metal phases are
not dispersed. One of the present difficulties is preventing contami-
nation of the samples with small quantities of bismuth during cleaning
of the samples and the ensuing chemical analyses.

A natural circulation loop constructed of Hastelloy N and filled with
fuel salt has been operated for about two years; a molybdenum cup con~-
taining bismuth was placed near the bottom of the loop. To date, the
3-20

reported concentrations of bismuth in salt from the loop (<5 ppm) are
essentially the same as those reported for salt from a loop containing
no bismuth. No degradation of metallurgical properties for corrosion
specimens removed from the loop containing bismuth has been noted.

Operation of a molten-salt reactor with a small fraction (less than 1%)

of the uranium present as UF3 is advantageous in order to minimize a
corrosion reactions and the oxidizing tendency of the fission process.

The [UF*]/[UF3] ratio in the MSRE was maintained at the desired level

by reduction of uth with beryllium metal, and a voltammetric method for »
the determination of this ratio in the MSRE fuel was developed. The
final step in the processing plant will consist in continuously measur-
ing and adjusting the (otty/ ute] ratio of the fuel salt returned to
the reactor.

 

3.3.3.6 Actinide separation and recycle po

It appears to be desirable to separate the transuranium actinides and

recycle these elements to the reactor for transmutation to less undesir- i
able isotopes in order to minimize difficulties associated with the
storage and disposal of wastes containing such materials. A preliminary
examination of a recycle flowsheet indicated that actinide separation
and recycle should be possible in a processing plant not significantly
more complex than the one presently being considered.

3.4 TASK GROUP 2.1 FLOWSHEET ANALYSIS AND DEVELOPMENT

Work in this task group is concerned with computer analyses of processing
systems, and the evaluation and development of processing plant flowsheets.

3.4.1 Ob jective Gi
The objective of this task group is to identify and to develop flowsheets
for processing the fuel from a molten-salt reactor which will be optimum i

with respect to criteria such as practicability, power costs, resource
utilization, and environmental effects.

3.4.4 Task 2.1.1 Heat balances

 

An existing general computer code will be used and additional codes will

be developed when necessary to calculate the amount of decay heat release
for each operation in the processing plant. This work is necessary to
determine the heat transfer area required in each piece of equipment.

Codes based upon equilibrium stage models will be modified to allow

models in which mass transport effects predominate. In some cases the
allowable heat release rate will limit the fission product concentrations
because of heat removal considerations. Decay heat generation rates will
be obtained from concentration data determined in mass balance calculations.

3.4.5 Task 2.1.2 Mass balances

 

For the more promising flowsheets, mass balance calculations will be made
for each fission product nuclide and for all transuranium isctopes using
the computer codes mentioned in the previous section. The mass balance
calculations will be coupled with a calculation for the reference reactor
design in order that the effect of calculated removal times and the effect
of recycle of transuranium isotopes on the reactor performance can be
determined. All calculations will be continually updated as new process
data (equilibria, mass transfer coefficients, etc.) become available.

3.4.6 Task 2.1.3 Parametric and optimization studies

 

The computer code which calculates mass balances, heat generation rates,
and waste production rates will be used to do parametric studies in order
that modifications of the reference flowsheet will reflect an optimization
of the effect caused by each characteristic which is studied. Parameters
to be varied include reductant concentrations, salt and bismuth flow
rates, and modifications to the flowsheet.

3.4.7 Task 2.1.4 Waste characterization

 

3.4.7.1 Subtask 2.1.4.1 Waste types and production rates

The material balance calculations using the previously mentioned computer
codes will be used to describe volumes and compositions of waste streams
associated with each proposed flowsheet. Waste disposal considerations
associated with each flowsheet will be assessed from these calculations.

3.4.7.2 Subtask 2.1.4.2 Waste hazard studies

 

For each waste stream, calculations using the computer code ORIGEN will
be made to determine the activity and waste hazard as a function of time.
This subtask is necessary for evaluating the environmental effects of
MSBR operation, and for comparing waste hazards of MSBR's with waste
hazards of other reactor concepts.
3-24

3.4.8 Task 2.1.5 Processing plant conceptual design and cost
estimate

For particularly attractive flowsheets, preliminary plant designs will
be performed in which equipment sizes, materials of construction, heat
transfer surface areas, line sizes, and pump sizes will be specified.
Material balance and heat generation calculations discussed in previous
sections will also serve as the basis for these studies in which plant
costs will be estimated.

3.4.9 Task 2.1.6 Processing system control

 

3.4.9.1 Subtask 2.1.6.1 Steady state analyses
An analysis of steady state operation of proposed flowsheets will be

done to identify those variables to which the process will be sensitive
and to identify possible control methods.

3.4.9.2 Subtask 2.1.6.2 Transient analyses

 

Once important control variables are identified from steady-state analyses,
transient analyses must be performed in order to assess the severity of
control problems and to suggest various means for effecting the desired
control. Equipment models which accurately describe time-dependent be-
havior would be developed.

3.4.9.3 Subtask 2.1.6.3 Effects of off-design operation

 

Off-design operation of the processing plant could result from startup,
undetected equipment failure, and control difficulties. The consequences
of events such as failure of the fluorinator to remove the required frac-
tion of uranium, increases in mass transfer resistances in salt-metal
contactors, changes in flow rates, etc., will be assessed. Actions neces-
sary for return to normal operation will be determined. The effect on
breeding performance of prolonged or periodic off-design operation will
be assessed.

3.4.9.4 Subtask 2.1.6.4 Information required for control

 

The analyses described above will identify those variables which must
be controlled and the degree of control required. Quantities which can
be measured and used as control signals will be identified.

3.4.10 Task 2.1.7 Resource requirements and utilization

The flowsheet analyses which have been discussed will allow the identi-
fication of the requirements for all material used in the construction

 

 
Ges

3-25

and operation of an MSBR processing plant. These material requirements
will be compared to projections of domestic and world resources and re-
serves of these materials in order to identify any materials that are
likely to limit a growing MSBR industry, and allow for any necessary
modification in order to avoid a significant resource limitation.

3.4.11 Task 2.1.8 Alternate process development

 

The current reference processing flowsheet consists of a sequence of
operations, the failure of any one of which has a significant effect
on the overall processing efficiency. Moreover, alternatives do not
presently exist for most of the processing steps. It is the objective
of this task to define alternates for each of the processing steps and,
if possible, define a completely new and different processing scheme.

Initially, the effort in this task will be devoted toc a thorough review
of the pertinent literature relating to the chemistry of protactinium
and fission products in molten fluoride salts. Hopefully, ideas for
new separations methods will be generated. Concurrently, preliminary
laboratory studies of potential sorption and ion-exchange processes will
be made. If attractive alternates are defined, they will be emphasized
in further work.

3.5 TASK GROUP 2.2 CONTINUOUS FLUORINATOR DEVELOPMENT

This task group covers activities necessary for the development of
technology related to the continuous removal of uranium from MSBR fuel
salt by contact with elemental fluorine. The initial work is concerned
with the development of autoresistance heating methods for simulating
heat generation resulting from fission product decay in fluorinators,

and with the study of the fluorination chemistry of uranium and other
elements which can be oxidized te higher valence states by contact with
fluorine. Subsequent work is related to the design, construction and
operation of a facility for engineering development and testing of con-
tinuous fluorinators. The task group culminates in the design, construc—
tion, and operation of a facility for engineering development and testing
of equipment in which the removal of uranium from MSBR fuel salt by
fluorination and the recombination of uranum with MSBR fuel carrier salt
can be carried out simultaneously.

3.5.1 Objective

The objective of this task group is to develop the technology required
for the design of fluorinators for the continuous removal of uranium
from salt streams in MSBR processing systems.

3.5.3 Funding

Operating funds required for Task Group 2.2 are shown in Table 3.5.3.
Capital equipment funds are required in the amounts of $50,000 during

FY 1975 for design and construction of the Continuous Fluorinator
Experimental Facility and of $125,000 during FY 1976 for covering one
half of the cost of the Fluorimation-Reconstitution Engineering Facility.
The remaining cost of this facility is covered in Task Group 2.3. Capital
equipment funds in the amount of $75,000 will be required during FY 1976
to provide automatic data-logging equipment for the Fluorination-
Reconstitution Engineering Facility.

3.5.4 Facilities

A Continuous Fluorinator Facility is planned for installation in Bldg.
4505 at ORNL. This facility will be used for study and demonstration
of continuous fluorination from mid FY 1976 through FY 1977, and will
require a capital equipment obligation of $50,000 in FY 1975. Im this
facility, a frozen-wall continuous fluorinator would be operated that
has a molten zone diameter of 5 in. and a height of about 5 ft. The
facility will operate with salt and fluorine flow rates up to 507 of
those required in a 1000-MW(e) MSBR.

A Fluorination-Recombination Engineering Facility is planned for installa-
tion in Bldg. 7303 at ORNL for study and demonstration of the integrated
operations of fluorimation and fuel reconstitution using flow rates that
are gbout 50% of those required for a 1000-MW(e) MSBR. The facility will
operate from mid-FY 1977 through FY 1978. This facility is also discussed
in Task Group 2.3 Fuel Reconstitution under Task 2.3.3 Fluorination-
Reconstitution Engineering Facility.

3.5.5 Task 2.2.1 Nonradicactive heat generation studies

The fluorinator will be an open bubble column made of nickel having a
frozen layer of salt on the walls to protect against corrosion by fluo-
rine. An internal heat source is necessary for maintaining the frozen
salt layer. Fission product decay will provide this heat source in the
processing plant, but in initial experiments where no radioactive heat
source is available another means must be found. This task would pro-
vide a heat source which can be used in nonradioactive experiments to
study fluorination in frozen wall fluorinators.

Studies of autoresistance heating must be done tc demonstrate the
operability of an electrode side arm design on a fluorinateor mockup

and the ability to maintain stable salt films using the LiF-BeF,-ThF,
salt mixture. Experiments with presently installed equipment indicates
that the wall temperature must be held significantly lower than the tem-
perature for which this equipment was designed. Experimental equipment
will be designed which will allow external heating and recirculation of

salt through the fluorinator mockup and forced cooling of the section
which will support the frozen salt film. This experiment will also
test a method for introducing a salt stream into a fluorinator heated
by autoresistance heating.

3.5.6 Task 2.2.2 Fluorination chemistry

 

The objective of this task is to demonstrate the removal of uranium from

MSBR fuel salt and to study the fluorination chemistry of uranium, prot-

ractinium, neptunium, plutonium, iodine, and other fission products that

will be oxidized to a higher valence state during fluorination. A second
objective of this task is to determine the extent to which oxide will be

removed from the salt by fluorination.

3.5.6.1 Subtask 2.2.2.1 Uranium removal from fuel salt

 

The initial objective of this subtask is to confirm the expected ease of
removal of uranium from MSBR fuel salt by fluorination to UFg. Later
objectives are to determine as a function of temperature the kinetics of
UFg formation and volatilization from the salt. The results of these
studies will allow selection of conditions that provide for rapid re-
moval of uranium from the salt with high fluorine utilizations.

3.5.6.2 Subtask 2.2.2.2 Fluorination chemistry of elements other
than uranium

 

The objective of this subtask is to define the behavior during fluori-
nation of elements that are present in the salt only at low concentra-
tion. Of particular interest are protactinium, neptunium, plutonium,
oxygen and iodine which form volatile fluorides under some conditions.
The extent to which such elements form volatile fluorides under optimal
conditions for uranium removal will be determined. The oxidation

states of these fluorides will be identified, since this knowledge is
required in defining the chemistry of the subsequent fuel reconstitution
step.

Certain elements (cerium, for example) attain higher oxidation states
during fluorimation, but the higher-valent fluoride is not volatile.
Studies will be made to determine which of the trace elements in the

salt are affected in this manner and to determine the ultimate oxidation
state of each. The effects of the presence of the higher-valent fluorides
on corrosion and on the chemistry of the subsequent reductive extraction
step will be assessed.

3.5.7 Task 2.2.3 Frozen wall corrosion protection studies

The objective of this task is to demonstrate that frozen salt films
will protect nickel from corrosion in fluorine-molten salt environments.

 

 
3=31

There are good reasons for believing that frozen salt films will protect
against corrosion, but this has not yet been demonstrated. An experiment
will be performed in which a frozen salt film is formed on a nickel tube
through which fluorine can be sparged into molten salt. This work re-
quires the installation of a fluorine supply system and a fluorine dis-
posal system. Installation of these systems is in progress.

3.5.8 Task 2.2.4 Mass transfer in open bubble columns

 

The objective of this task is to provide basic design data upon which
initial designs of open bubble columns operating with molten-salt systems
can be based. Later designs will be based upon this data plus actual
operating data obtained with molten-salt systems.

Mass transfer coefficients will be measured in sir-aqueous solution sys-
tems in order to provide correlations for estimating uranium removal rate
and fluorine utilization in the fluorinator. Mass transfer coefficients
which are corrected for end effects and for axial dispersion will be
measured in glass bubble columns for the bubble flow and the slug flow
regimes and for varying physical properties of the liquid phase. End
effects are important and methods for estimating the magnitude of end
effects will be investigated.

3.5.9 Task 2.2.5 Characterization of the Fy~H, reaction

 

The objective of this work is to provide guidance for the formulation of
safety policies concerning areas in the processing plant where fluorine
and hydrogen are used in close proximity. The literature will be re-
viewed for information on the kinetics and explosion (or reaction) limits
of the F,-H, reaction. Conditions will be sought under which Hp and Fj
might form a mixture which might react explosively and destructively if
an ignition source were supplied.

Fluorine and hydrogen gases will be mixed in a reaction vessel at low
temperatures and pressures. These mixtures will be pressurized at con-
stant temperature or heated at constant pressure until reaction occurs
in order to define the limits of spontaneous reaction of mixtures of
different compositions. Nonreactive F,-H, mixtures will be exposed

to ignition sources of varying types (the presence of atomic fluorine,
radiation, spark, light, etc.) in order to determine the effect of igni~-
tion source.

3.5.10 Task 2.2.6 Continuous Fluorinator Experimental Facility

The objective of this work is to provide a facility with which continuous
frozen-wall fluorinators can be tested.
3-32

3.5.10.1 Subtask 2.2.6.1 Definition of experimental program and
conceptual design

The work is this subtask will be directed to defining the experimental

program and completing the conceptual design for the Continuous Fluori-

nator Experimental Facility. The experiments carried out in this facility

will have the objectives of (1) demonstrating frozen wall corrosion pro- wi
tection in continuous fluorinators, (2) measuring the effect of operating

conditions on F; utilization, (3) measuring the effect of operating condi-

tions on uranium removal efficiency, and (4) corroborating the correlations a
derived from air-water measurements. The effect on Fp, utilization and U

removal efficiency of the following variables will be measured: gas flow

rate, liquid flow rate, temperature, and concentration of UF, in the salt.

Following the fluorination experiments, the facility will be used to study “=
reconstitution of UFg which is mixed with fluorine in order to test methods

of fuel reconstitution which do not require separation of the UFg and

fluorine. Frozen wall corrosion protection will be required. EE

Equipment for the experiment will include a fluoride salt surge tank,

a fluorinator, a salt-hydrogen contactor, UFg collection and fluorine ii
disposal systems, means for determining the UFg; concentration in the

fluorinator offgas, and means for sampling the salt streams present in
the system. Salt containing UF; will be withdrawn from the surge tank
and fed to the fluorinator where part of the uranium will be removed
as UFg. The salt leaving the fluorinator will be fed to the hydrogen-
salt contactor for reduction of uranium fluorides to UF, before the salt

is returned to the surge tank. Salt will be circulated through the sys- os
tem at flow rates in the range 0.3 to 3 liters/min. The fluoride salt
surge tank volume (about 5 ft3) is sufficiently large that the uranium
concentration in the salt fed to the fluorinator will vary over a useful
composition range (approximately 0.35 mole % to 0.00035 mole %) in about
3 hr at a molten salt flow rate of about 1 liter/min. The fluorinator
will consist of a 6-in.-OD vessel which will be heated by autoresistance
heating using 60-Hz power. The molten salt zone will be about 4.5-in.
in diam and the salt depth in the fluorinater will be about 6 ft.

Conceptual design of this facility will consist of a choice of the scale i
of equipment, identification of auxiliary equipment (gas supplies, excess
reagent and waste disposal systems, instrumentation calibration stations,
etc.) , location of equipment, and preliminary design and layout of
equipment.

 

3.5.10.2 Subtask 2.2.6.2 Final design i

 

The final design of the facility will involve detailed analysis and cal-

culations required to ensure that the facility will meet the desired a
objectives and that experiments which will be performed will provide the
necessary information. Thermal and mechanical stresses will be evaluated
and maintained within allowable limits. Instrumentation and control sys-
tems will be designed to provide information and necessary control action.
The final design will include provisions for equipment maintenance, re-
placement, or medificatien.
3-33

3.5.10.3 Subtask 2.2.6.3 Fabrication, installation and initial
testing

Construction of the facility will be Quality Level IIT and a quality
assurance plan will be prepared in accordance with ORNL quality assur-
ance procedure QA-L-1-104.

Following installation of the facility, the system will be leak checked
and salt will be charged to the experiment. Initial testing will include
recirculation of salt, formation and maintenance of the frozen wall, and
calibration of special instrumentation (salt flow meters, gas chromato-
graphs, etc.). A detailed safety analysis will be prepared before
operation of the facility.

Prior to startup detailed check lists will be prepared for the following
operations: (1) startup and shutdown of fluorine supply system; (2) start-
up and shutdown of the fluorine disposal system; (3) operation of instru-
mentation; (4) salt sampling; (5) operation of the UFg disposal system;

(6) operation of the hydrogen supply system; (7) formation of frozen salt
film; and (8) salt recirculation and drainage.

3.5.10.4 Subtask 2.2.6.4 Operation

The Continuous Fluorination Experimental Facility will be operated during
the period from mid FY 1976 te mid FY 1977 in order to develop the tech-
nology required for the subsequent design of the Fluorination-Reconstitution
Engineering Facility, and to provide improved data on fluorinator perfor-
mance for processing plant conceptual design and cost estimation studies.
Alternate fluorinator designs will be tested as required. Sufficient

data will be obtained to show the practicability of frozen-wall fluori-
nator operation.

3.5.11 Task 2.2.7 Fluorination—-Reconstitution Engineering Facility

The objective of this task is to provide a facility in which the opera-
tion of a continuous fluorinator and equipment for fuel reconstitution
can be integrated in order to determine operating characteristics for
the combined steps, to evaluate control methods, and to determine the
extent to which surge capacity must be provided between the two opera-
tions. Sufficient information will be obtained to allow design of the
fluorination-reconstitution systems for the Integrated Process Test
Facility as well as for the test reactor mockup.

This facility will allow the testing of fluorinators which will operate
under conditions very similar to those expected in a processing plant.
The fluorinators in this facility will be designed for much higher
uranium removal efficiences (>99%) than will be possible in the Contin-
uous Fluorinator Experimental Facility (80-90%). The information to be
determined from this facility is associated with long-term operability
and control of continuous frozen-wall fluorinators. Emphasis will be
3-34

placed upon frozen film stability and integrity, accurate corrosion
measurements and maintenance of high uranium removal efficiency and
fluorine utilization.

The facility will be located in Bldg. 7503 (MSRE Building) and is dis-
cussed in detail in Task 2.3.3.

3.6 TASK GROUP 2.3 FUEL RECONSTITUTION

This task group covers activities necessary for the development of tech-
nology related to the continuous recombination of MSBR fuel carrier salt
and the UFg produced by fluorination of fuel salt. The initial work is
concerned with the design and operation of small engineering experiments
on the recombination operation, and with the study of the recombination
chemistry of uranium and other elements which will form volatile fluo-
rides during fluorination. Subsequent work is related to the design and
operation of larger engineering experiments on fuel reconstitution. The
task group culminates in the design, construction, and operation of a
facility for development and testing of equipment in which the removal
of uranium from MSBR fuel salt by fluorination and the recombination of
uranium with MSBR fuel carrier salt can be carried out simultaneously.

3.6.1 Objective

The objective of this task group is to provide the technology necessary
for design of equipment for recombining UF; generated in the fluorinators
in the processing plant with the processed fuel salt stream returning

to the reactor to produce a salt mixture having the proper uranium
concentration.

3.6.2 Schedule

The schedule for this task group is shown in Table 3.6.2.

3.6.3 Funding

Operating funds required for Task Group 2.3 are shown in Table 3.6.3.
The operating fund requirements for Task 2.3.3 have been shared with
Task 2.2.7, since this is the same facility. Capital equipment funds
are required in the amounts of $5,000 during FY 1975 for gas density
cells for HF and UFg analyses in Task 2.3.2, and of $125,000 during
FY 1976 to cover one half of the cost for designing and comstructing
the Fluorination-Reconstitution Engineering Facility. The remaining
cost of this facility is covered in Task Group 2.2.

3.6.4 Facilities

A Fluorination-Reconstitution Engineering Facility is planned for instal-
lation in Bldg. 7503 for study and demonstration of the integrated oper-
ations of fluorination and reconstitution using flow rates that are about
50% of those required for processing a 1000-MW(e) MSBR. The facility
will operate from late FY 1977 through FY 1978. This facility interfaces
with Task Group 2.2, Continuous Fluorinator Development.

3.6.5 Task 2.3.1 Fuel reconstitution chemistry

The objective of this task is to determine the fuel reconstitution
chemistry of uranium and other elements which form volatile fluorides
during fluorination including neptunium, plutonium, and iodine.

3.6.5.1 Subtask 2.3.1.1 Uranium chemistry

The objective of this subtask is to elucidate the chemistry of the reac-
tions of gaseous UFg and fluorine with UF, dissolved in MSBR fuel salt
and the subsequent reduction of the product UFs by hydrogen. Previous
work has shown that the primary reactions are

UFg(g) + UF, (d) = 2UFg(d)

and
1/2 Fy(g) + UF, (d) = UFs5(d),

but that some UF5 is volatilized from the melt according to
UF5(d) = UFs5(g) .

Estimates of the equilibrium constant for these reactions will be made
to aid in the design of engineering-scale equipment for fuel reconstitu-
tion studies.

Previous work has also shown that the reaction

UF5(d) + 1/2 Hy(g) = UF,(d) + HF(g)
is slower than the UFg absorption reactions. Information on the kinetics
of this reaction will be obtained. Of particular interest are the deter-

mination of the rate-controlling step and the effect of temperature on
the reaction rate.

3.6.5.2 GSubtask 2.3.1.2 Chemistry of other volatile fluorides

The objective of this subtask is to elucidate the chemistry of such vola-
tile fluorides as NpFg, PuFg, OF, and IF7 in the fuel reconstitution step.
3-38

The initial work will establish whether dissolved UF, reduces the gaseous
species NpFg and IFy; if so, the stoichiometries and equilibrium constants
for the reactions will be determined. The oxidation state of the reduced
iodine species will be of special interest since this species will be
present in the subsequent step in which hydrogen is used to reduce dis-
solved UF;. Some attention will be paid to the fate of such noble metal
fluorides as MoFg which should be reduced to a lower-valent fluoride by
dissolved UF, and possibly would be reduced to the metallic state during
the hydrogen reduction of UFs. The extent to which oxygen is introduced
into the fuel salt during reconstitution via reactions involving OF, will
also be determined.

3.6.6 Task 2.3.2 Engineering studies of fuel reconstitution

 

The objective of this task is to study the absorption of UFg by salt con-
taining UF, and to study the reduction of the resulting UFs5 to UF, with
hydrogen in an engineering system on a scale which will allow sufficient
engineering design data to be obtained to design the Fluorination-
Reconstitution Engineering Facility. These tests will require a molten
salt metering system, a UFg supply and metering system, a UF. disposal
system, a hydrogen supply, an HF disposal system, and devices for mea-
suring UFg and HF concentration in gas streams. The use of gold plated
or gold~lined equipment for corrosion protection will be investigated.
Studies are planned in a l1-in.-ID combined absorption-reduction system
having the shape of a U-tube. The hydrogen reduction side of the U-tube
determines the overall height of the column, which will be about 10 ft.
Salt flow rates up to 300 cc/min, Ho, flow rates up to 720 std cc/min,

and UFg flow rates up to 360 std cc/min will be investigated. Reconsti-
tution experiments in which the UFg is associated with fluorine, as would
be the case from an actual fluorinator, will be carried out in the Con-
tinuous Fluorinator Experimental Facility. Frozen wall corrosion protec-
tion would be required in this case.

3.6.7 Task 2.3.3 Fluorination-Reconstitution Engineering Facility

 

The objective of this task is to provide a facility in which the opera-
tion of a continuous fluorinator and equipment for fuel reconstitution
can be integrated in order to determine operating characteristics for
the combined steps, to evaluate control methods, and to determine the
extent to which surge capacity must be provided between the two opera-
tions. Sufficient information will be obtained to allow design of
fluorination~reconstitution systems for the Integrated Process Test
Facility and for the test reactor mockup.

3.6.7.1 Subtask 2.3.3.1 Definition of experimental program and
conceptual design

The reconstitution experiments carried out in this facility will have
the following objectives: (1) to determine if uranium losses can occur
during long-term operation, (2) to test the effects of using recycle
streams in the reconstitution step, (3) to determine the need for surge
capacity between operations, (4) to determine long-term corrosion rates,
and (5) to test operability of combined processes. This facility will be
located in Bldg. 7503 (MSRE Building). Conceptual design will consist
of a choice of the scale of the equipment, identification of auxiliary
equipment (gas supplies, excess reagent and waste disposal systems, in-
strumentation calibration stations, etc.}, and preliminary design and
layout of equipment consistent with experimental objectives. The areas
which will require development work before completing the final design
will be identified.

3.6.7.2 Subtask 2.3.3.2 Development work required for final design

Plans for required development will be detailed, and schedules determined
which are consistent with the overall schedule for this task.

3.6.7.3 Subtask 2.3.3.3 Final design

The final design of the facility will involve detailed analyses and
calculations required to ensure that the facility will meet the objec-
tives and that experiments which will be performed in it will provide
the necessary information. Thermal and mechanical stresses will be
maintained within allowable limits. Instrumentation and control systems
will be designed to provide information and necessary control action.
The final design will include provisions for equipment maintenance,
replacement, or modification.

3.6.7.4 Subtask 2.3.3.4 Fabrication, installation, and initial testing

Construction of the facility will be to Quality Level III standards and
a quality assurance plan will be prepared in accordance with ORNL quality
assurance procedure QA-L-1-104.

Following installation of the facility, the system will be leak checked
and salt will be charged to the experiment. Initial testing will include
recirculation of salt at rates up to the design limit, formation of
frozen walls where required, and calibration of special instrumentation
(salt flow meters, gas chromatographs, etc.). A detailed safety analysis
will be prepared.

Prior to startup detailed check lists will be prepared for the following
operations: (1) startup and shutdown of the fluorine supply system;
3-40

(2) startup and shutdown of the fluorine disposal system; (3) operation
of instrumentation; (4) salt sampling; (5) operation of the hydrogen
supply system; (6) formation of frozen salt film; and (7) salt recircu-
lation and drainage.

3.6.7.5 Subtask 2.3.3.5 Operation

 

The Fluorination-Recomstitution Engineering Facility will be operated
from late FY 1977 through FY 1978 in order to develop the technology
required for the subsequent design of the associated portions of the
Integrated Process Test Facility, and to provide improved data on
fluorination and reconstitution equipment performance for processing
plant conceptual design and cost estimation studies. Alternate equip-
ment designs for the primary operations of fluorination and reconsti-
tution will be tested as required. Sufficient information will be
obtained to show the practicability of the combined fluorination-
reconstitution steps.

3.7 TASK GROUP 2.4 PROTACTINIUM REMOVAL

This task group covers activities necessary for the development of
technology related to the removal of protactinium from MSBR fuel salt
by selective extraction into liquid bismuth containing reductant. The
initial work is concerned with study of mass transfer and hydrodynamics
in salt-metal contactors, and with the development of equipment for
hydrofluorinating or hydrochlorinating molten salts in the presence of
liquid bismuth. Subsequent work is related to the design, construction,
and operation of a facility for engineering development and testing of

components necessary for protactinium removal. The task group culminates

in the design, construction, and operation of a small engineering exper-
iment that will use representative concentrations of 231pa (an energetic
alpha emitter) for demonstrating all steps in the protactinium removal
operation.

3.7.1 Objective

The objective of this task group is to develop the technology necessary
for designing systems for removing protactinium from the fuel salt in
order to allow it to decay to 233y outside the reactor.

3.7.3 Funding

Operating funds required for Task Group 2.4 are shown in Table 3.7.3.
Capital equipment funds will be required in the amounts of $190,000
in FY 1976 for the Reductive Extraction Process Facility (Task 2.4.3),
and $400,000 in FY 1977 for the Protactinium Isclation Demonstration
Experiment (Task 2.4.4).

The program will require alpha containment space for the Protactinium
Isolation Demonstration Experiment. This space will be provided by
converting cell 2, Bldg. 3019, into a multilevel alpha facility. GPP
funds in the amount of $355,000 will be required in early FY 1976 for
this modification.

3.7.4 Facilities

The Salt/Bismuth Flow-Through Facility is an existing facility for
studying various types of contactors for reductive extraction of 237g
and 27Zr from molten salt into molten bismuth, and for studying hydro-
fluorination of bismuth in the presence of molten salt. This facility
is located in Bldg. 3592 and will operate through FY 1975.

A Reductive Extraction Process Facility will be installed in Bldg.
7503 for study and demonstration of all steps of protactinium removal
with flow rates that are 25% of those required for a 1000-MW(e) MSBR.
This facility will operate from early FY 1977 to mid FY 1978. A
capital equipment obligation of $190,000 is required in FY 1976 for
construction of this facility.

A Protactinium Isolation Demonstration Experiment would be installed

in Cell 2 in Bldg. 3019 to demonstrate all process steps for the removal

from fuel salt using representative concentrations of protactinium.

This demonstration will begin in late FY 1977 and end in early FY 1979.

A capital equipment obligation of $400,000 is required during FY 1977.

3.7.5 Task 2.4.1 Salt-metal contactor development

The objective of this task is to provide the technology required for
designing equipment for contacting molten salt and molten bismuth

in order to carry out the transfer of protactinium from salt streams
into bismuth streams. The equipment which is developed must not be
unreasonably large; and must not be expensive to fabricate.

3.7.5.1 Subtask 2.4.1.1 Mass transfer in a stirred interface contactor

Measurement of mass transfer rates of 237U and %7Zr tracers between fluo-

ride fuel carrier salt and bismuth will be continued in a nondispersed

stirred interface contactor installed in the Salt/Bismuth Flow-Through

Facility.

These results will permit the evaluation of contactors of

this type for MSBR processing systems. A sufficient range of flow rates,
distribution coefficients, etc., will be used to allow testing of a
general design relation.

3.7.5.2 Subtask 2.4.1.2 Hydrodynamics and mass transfer in stirred
interface contactors

 

Development of correlations for predicting mass transfer rates and dis-
persion of phases in stirred interface contactors of the Lewis type will
be continued. Experiments with aqueocus-mercury systems will be conducted
to measure mass transfer coefficients in metal and aqueous phases. The
effect of physical property variations will be investigated. Improved
methods for predicting the conditions under which the phases are dispersed
will be developed. Mechanically agitated contactors in which the phases
are dispersed will be developed for use with LiCl~-Bi contactors where
bismuth entrainment in the salt will not be a problem.

3.7.6 Task 2.4.2 Engineering studies of hydrofluorination and
hydrochlorination in salt-bismuth systems

The objective of this task is to provide the three phase (two-liquid
phases and a gas phase) contactors which will be required for oxidizing
materials from bismuth streams to return them to salt streams. Such
operations will be required for the HF-fluoride salt-bismuth system in
the reference processing flowsheet, and for the HCl-chloride salt-bismuth
system for flowsheets under consideration for actimide recycle.

Following the salt-metal contactor studies in the Salt/Bismuth Flow-
Through Facility, this facility will be modified to allow testing and
development of the required three-phase hydrofluorinators.

Design, installation, and operation of an experimental hydrofluorinator
for use with the fluoride salt-bismuth system is planned. This system
will allow for the measuring of rates of hydrofluorination of materials
from the bismuth phase to the fluoride salt phase and for obtaining suf-
ficient information for the subsequent design of a hydrofluorinator for
the Reductive Extraction Process Facility (Task 2.4.3). This hydro-
fluorinator will use either HF or H,-HF mixtures. Experience gained

in the operation of this equipment will permit the design of a hydro-
chlorinator for use with chloride salts.

3.7.7 Task 2.4.3 Reductive Extraction Process Facility

The objectives of this task are: (1) to conduct engineering experiments

to measure mass transfer data in contactors of sufficient size and with
sufficient accuracy to be used in the design of processing plant compo-
nents and in the subsequent design of associated portions of the Inte~
grated Process Test Facility, (2) to advance the technology of manipulating
3-46

molten salt and bismuth in engineering equipment, and (3) to advance the
technology of fabrication of equipment suitable for use in an MSER proc-
essing system.

3.7.7.1 Subtask 2.4.3.1 Definition of program and conceptual design

The reductive extraction process facility will allow testing and develop-
ment of equipment of a design suitable for use in a full-scale protactin=-
ium removal process. The facility will operate continuously and will be

used to develop multi-stage salt-bismuth contactors, salt-bismuth hydro-

fluorinators, methods for reductant addition, and other equipment items.

An experimental program will be defined to accomplish these objectives.

Conceptual design of this facility will consist of a choice of the scale
of the equipment, identification and design of auxiliary equipment (gas
supplies, excess reagent and waste disposal systems, instrumentation
calibration stations, etc.), and preliminary sketching and layout of
equipment. This facility will be installed in Bldg. 7503.

3.7.7.2 Subtask 2.4.3.2 Development work required for final design

Components of this facility which require further development before the
final design include the following: (1) a continuous hydrefluorimator,
(2) mechanical joints between molybdenum and graphite components, (3) salt
and bismuth pumps, and (4) a device for continuous reductant addition.
These components will be designed and tested to the extent necessary be~
fore incorporation into the final design.

3.7.7.3 Subtask 2.4.3.3 Final design

 

The final design of the facility will involve detailed analysis and
calculations required to ensure that the facility will meet the program
objectives and that experiments which will be performed in it will pro-
vide the necessary information. Thermal and mechanical stresses will
be maintsined within allowable limits. Instrumentation and control
systems will be designed to provide information and necessary control
action. The final design will include provisions for equipment mainte-
nance, replacement, or modification,

3.7.7.4 Subtask 2.4.3.4 Fabrication, installation, and testing

Construction of the facility will be to Quality Level III standards and
a quality assurance plan will be prepared in accordance with ORNL quality
assurance procedure QA-L-1-104.

Following installation of the facility the system will be leak checked,
and the salt and bismuth will be charged to the system and will be

 
SE

3-47

purified by circulation through the hydrofluorinator. Initial testing
will include this operation and the calibration of special instrumenta-
tion (salt and bismuth flowmeters and interface detectors).

3.7.7.5 Subtask 2.4.3.5 Operation

 

Prior to initial testing and startup detailed check lists will be prepared
for the following operations: (1) startup and shutdown of HF supply sys-
tem; (2) startup and shutdown of the HF disposal system; (3) operation of
instrumentation; (4) salt and bismuth sampling; (5) salt and bismuth re-
circulation; (6) reductant addition; (7) hydrofluorinator operation; and
(8) salt and bismuth drainage.

The REPF will operate continuously and be used to develop multistage
salt-bismuth contactors, salt-bismuth hydroflucrinators, and other
required equipment items. Data will be obtained on materials of con~
struction, corrosion, the rate of mass transfer of uranium, zirconium,
thorium, and lithium between salt and bismuth phases and other data
required for evaluation and design of protactinium removal systems.
Sufficient information will be obtained for the subsequent design of
the associated portions of the Integrated Process Test Facility (Task
Group 2.9).

3.7.8 Task 2.4.4 Protactinium Isolation Demonstration Experiment

 

The objective of this experiment is to demonstrate with representative
concentrations of protactinium the process for removing Pa from fuel
salt. The process is based upon data from small equilibrium experiments
using Pa at the tracer level and upon extrapolations of results from
engineering experiments which did not actually use Pa. Completion of
this task is complicated by the fact that no stable isotope of Pa exists
and the resulting experiments must be conducted with 231pa which is an
energetic alpha emitter which requires special containment and operating
considerations.

3.7.8.1 Subtask 2.4.4.1 Modification of Cell 2, Bldg. 3019

A large laboratory area capable of containing high level alpha activity
is required for the demonstration. Cell 2 in Bldg. 3015 will be con~
verted into two alpha laboratory spaces in which MSBR fuel processing
experiments involving alpha-emitting materials, specifically protactinium,
will be conducted. This conversion will include extensive modification
of the present facilities including new flooring, a new hot change room,
modification of the present ventilation system, and new utilities.
3-48

3.7.8.2 Subtask 2.4.4.2 Program definition and conceptual design

4 review of the development program and identification of areas requiring
development will be completed. This will include locating and obtaining
sufficient quantities of protactinium for experimental purposes. Upon
determination of the amount of protactinium available, a flowsheet and
preliminary layout of equipment will be completed.

3.7.8.3 Subtask 2.4.4.3 Development work required for final design
Prototypes of the necessary experimental equipment will be designed,

constructed, and tested prior to the final design of the Protactinium
Isolation Demonstration Experiment.

3.7.8.4 Subtask 2.4.4.4 Final design

 

Final design, detailed flowsheet, and final equipment layout for the
Protactinium Isclation Demonstration Experiment to be installed in Cell
Z of Bldg. 3019 will be completed. A detailed safety analysis will be
prepared.

3.7.8.5 Subtask 2.4.4.5 Installation and initial testing
Fabrication of experimental equipment will be completed and the equip-

ment will be installed and tested before protactinium is added to the
system.

3.7.8.6 Subtask 2.4.4.6 Operation

 

Detailed check lists for all operations will be prepared. This experi-
ment will be operated continuously from late FY 1977 to late FY 1978.
These experiments will corroborate protactinium removal flowsheets which
were developed solely from chemical laboratory data and extrapolations
from engineering experiments in which no Pa was used.

3.7.8.7 Subtask 2.4.4.7 Equipment disposal and protactinium
reclamation

The protactinium will be recovered from the experimental equipment in a
form which will be convenient for storage and reuse, probably as a re-
duced form in Li-Bi alloy. The process will be designed for this re-
covery as the final step. The equipment will be decontaminated or
removed and the facility will be decontaminated.

3.8 TASK GROUP 2.5 RARE-EARTH REMOVAL

This task group covers activities necessary for the development of
technology related to the removal of rare-earth fission products from
MSBR fuel carrier salt by selective extraction into liquid bismuth con-
taining reductant and transfer to molten LiCl. The initial work is
concerned with study of mass transfer and hydrodynamics in salt-metal
contactors, and with operation of an engineering experiment that uses
salt and bismuth flow rates that are about 17 of those required for
processing a 1000-MW(e) MSBR. The task group culminates in the design,
construction and operation of a facility for engineering development
and testing of components necessary for rare-earth removal that will
use salt and bismuth flow rates which are about 10% of those required
for a 1000-MW{e) MSER.

3.8.1 Objective

The objective of this task is to develop the technolegy required for
design of equipment for separating the rare-earth fission products from
MSBR fuel salt.

3.8.2 Schedule

The schedule for execution of Task Group 2.5 is shown in Table 3.8.2.

3.8.3 Funding

Operating funds required for Task Group 2.5 are shown in Table 3.8.3.
Obligation of capital equipment funds in the amount of $200,000 will be
required during FY 1976 for construction of the Metal Transfer Process
Facility.

3.8.4 Facilities

The Metal Transfer Process Facility would be located in the high bay
area of Bldg. 7503. This facility will be used for study and demon-
stration of the metal transfer process for rare-earth removal with
flow rates which are about 10% of those required in a 1000-MW(e) MSBR.
This facility will operate continuously from early FY 1977 to mid FY
1978.

An existing facility, the Salt/Bismuth Flow-Through Facility, located
in Bldg. 3592 is currently being used to test mechanically agitated
non-dispersing salt-bismuth contactors.

3.8.5 Task 2.5.1 Metal transfer experiment MTE-3B

 

Metal transfer experiment MIE-3B is of similiar design to experiment
MTE-3, which was an engineering scale experiment using salt and bismuth
flow rates that were about 1% of the estimated flow rates required for
processing a 1000-MW({e) reactor. The rates of transfer of rare earths
between the three salt and metal phases in experiment MTE-3 ranged
between 10 and 30% of the rates predicted by literature correlations.

The study of mass transfer rates of rare earths in MIE-3B will be con-
tinued. Mass transfer rates will be compared with literature and other
correlations being developed. In addition, the long-term stability of
the transfer rates, the effect of solids accumulation at the salt-metal
interfaces on transfer rates, and the effect of rare-earth concentra-
tions on transfer rates will be investigated.

3.8.6 Task 2.5.2 Salt-metal contactor development

 

The objective of this task is to develop the technology necessary for
designing equipment for contacting molten salt and molten bismuth in
order toc carry out the transfer of rare earths from salt streams into
bismuth streams. This task interfaces with Task 2.4.1, Salt-Metal
Contactor Development.

3.8.6.1 Subtask 2.5.2.3 Removal of interfacial solids

 

One possible reason for the lower than expected rare-earth transfer
rates observed in MIE-3 could be that air and/or moisture entered the
equipment (in spite of careful operation to prevent such contamination)
and reacted with the salts, metals, or other constituents to form in-
soluble oxides, etc. These materials would collect at the interfaces
to perhaps form a thin film and be a barrier to material transfer.
Means to remove any such films during operation of metal transfer
process equipment will be developed.

3.8.7 Task 2.5.3 Metal Transfer Process Facility

 

The objective of this task is to provide a facility for testing and
development of equipment of & design suitable for use in a full-scale
process for removal of rare earths from a MSBR fuel carrier salt.
Experiments will be carried out in the facility to develop multistage
salt-bismuth contactors as well as other required equipment which will
provide data on the rate of removal of rare earths from the fuel carrier
salt and evaluate the suitability of materials of construction and long-
term reliability of system components. Provisions for maintenance of
process equipment and removal of system components for modification,
repair or installation of equipment of alternate design will be included
in the design of the facility.

 
an

3-53

The facility will be located in the high bay area of Bldg. 7503 and will
require the installation of purified HF, Hy, and Ar supply systems.
Initially the facility will be used for Metal Transfer Experiment MIE~4
with salt and metal flow rates 5 to 10% of those required for a 1000-MW(e)
MSBR.

3.8.7.1 Subtask 2.5.3.1 Definition of experimental program and
conceptual design

The experimental program to be conducted during Metal Transfer Experiment
MTE-4, which will be carried out in the Metal Transfer Process Facility,
includes the following objectives:

1. demonstration of the removal of rare-earth fission products from
MSBR fuel carrier salt and accumulation of these materials in a
lithium-bismuth solution in equipment of a significant size;

2. determination of mass transfer coefficients between mechanically
agitated salt and bismuth phases;

3. determination of the rate of removal of rare earths from the
fluoride salt in multistage equipment;

4. evaluation of potential materials of construction, graphite in
particular;

5. testing of mechanical devices, such as pumps and agitators, that
will be required in a processing plant; and

6. development of instrumentation for measurement and control of
process variables such as salt-metal interface location, salt
flow rate, and salt or bismuth liquid level.

The proposed metal transfer process facility consists basically of the
following systems: (1) a fluoride salt system with which molten fluoride
salt containing rare-earth fluorides can be circulated at a controlled
rate through a salt-metal contactor, (2) a salt-metal contactor in which
the rare earths are extracted from the fluoride salt and transferred to
a stream of molten LiCl, (3) a LiCl system for circulating the LiCl at

a controlled rate between the salt-metal contactor and a Li-Bi stripper
where the rare earths are removed from the LiCl and deposited in a bis-
muth solution containing from 5 to 50 at. %# Li, (4) a salt-metal hydro-
fluorinator for removing oxide impurities from the salt and metal or

for returning the rare earths from the Li-Bi solution to the fluoride
salt after a run has been completed, and (5) drain and waste tanks for
storing salt and bismuth that are removed from the system. The system
will contain provisions for sampling the salt and bismuth phases in

each vessel and for sampling the salt streams from the salt-metal
contactor.
3-54

The principal equipment items are the fluoride salt surge tank, which

has a volume of about 300 liters and will comsist of a carbon steel

liner in a stainless steel vessel; a three-stage salt-metal contactor Ee
made of graphite and enclosed in a stainless steel containment vessel;

a stainless steel vessel having a graphite or carbon-steel limer in

which rare earths will be accumulated in a lithium~bismuth solution

having a volume of about 100 liters; and a hydrofluorinator that has

a volume of about 150 liters and consists of a graphite crucible en-

closed in z stainless steel vessel. Conceptual designs for this

equipment will be completed. ws

 

3.8.7.2 Subtask 2.5.3.2 Development work required for final design i

 

Development work and further evaluation of existing process equipment
required before the final design of the facility can be completed are:

1. Design criteria from the standpoint of ease of fabrication and
accepted design technology for graphite vessels.

2. Instrumentation for measurement and control of process variables
such as salt-metal interface locations, salt flow rates, and salt
and bismuth liquid level. Gi

3. Pumps required to circulate the salts (fuel carrier salt and LiCl).
Check valve pumps were used satisfactorily in Metal Transfer Exper-
iment MTE-3; however, centrifugal salt pumps of the type developed
at ORNL for use in forced circulation salt loops may have advantages.

 

3.8.7.3 Subtask 2.5.3.3 Final design

The final design of the facility will involve detailed amalysis and =
calculations required to ensure that the facility will meet the program

objectives. The adequacy of the containment of the hazardous materials

such as beryllium and thorium at elevated temperatures, radicactive rare-

earth tracers and HF and H, gases require careful attention. Thermal and

mechanical stresses need to be evaluated and maintained within allowable

limits. The final design will take into account the planned operating

procedures so that these are not unduly difficult. Instrumentation and FE
control systems will provide information and control actions necessary

to maintain the specified operating conditions, take corrective action,

as needed, if operating limits (temperature, pressure, flow rates, etc.) Lo

are exceeded, and operating data required to evaluate experimental =
results.
Further, the final design will include provisions for equipment main= Ee

tenance, replacement, or modification.
i

3-55

3.8.7.4 Subtask 2.5.3.4 Fabrication, installation, and initial testing

Construction of the facility will be Quality Level III and a quality
assurance plan will be prepared in accordance with ORNL quality assurance
procedure QA-L-1-104.

Gas supply systems to provide purified HF, Ho, and Ar will be installed
in Bldg. 7503. An emergency electric power system cemsisting of a
300-kvA, 480-V, three-phase diesel-driven motor-generator will be used
to provide sufficient power to maintain experiment operating conditions
and prevent salt freezing in the event of loss of normal building power.

After installation of Metal Transfer Experiment MIE-4, the entire system
will be pressure tested to ensure that it is leak tight and then treated
with hydrogen at 650°C to reduce any oxides on the interior surfaces of

the vessels. After the hydrogen treatment has been completed, the sys-~

tem will be flushed with argon and maintained under an argon atmosphere

to prevent entry of air and moisture.

All heater, instrumentation, and control circuits will be checked for
proper operation. Calibration of temperature and pressure indicators
and controllers will be performed and documented.

Prior tc startup and initial operation of experiment MTE-4, detailed
operating procedures for all phases of operation will be written. These
will include: (1) heatup of the MTE-4 system, (2) bismuth purification
and addition, (3) fuel carrier salt purification and addition, (4) Li-Bi
preparation and addition, (5) LiCl purification and addition, (6) salt
and bismuth sampling, (7) system shutdown (normal and emergency),

(8) draining of salts and bismuth, and (9) addition of rare earths to
system.

After the hydrogen treatment has been completed the system will be
flushed with argon, and salt and metal will be charged to the indi-
vidual vessels. Fluoride salt that has previously been purified will
be transferred as a liquid inte the fluoride salt storage tank. Bismuth
that has previously been purified by treatment with hydrogen will be
charged in molten form to the salt-metal contactor. Initially, the
Li-Bi solution for the Li-Bi stripper may be prepared either in the
Li-Bi stripper or in the salt-and-metal hydrofluorination vessel to
remove oxide impurities before it is transferred tc the Li-Bi stripper.
All of these operations have been carried out successfully cn a smaller
scale in previous experiments.

After the salt and metal phases have been charged to the system, the
LiCl and fluoride salt pumps and flow meters will be tested and cali-
brated. To test the fluoride salt system, salt will be circulated from
the fluoride salt storage vessel to the salt-metal contactor and back
to the fluoride salt storage vessel. The LiCl pump and flow meter will
be tested and calibrated by circulating LiCl from the Li-Bi stripper to
the salt-metal contactor, and back to the Li-Bi stripper. The system
will then be ready to begin normal operation.
3-56

3.8.7.5 Subtask 2.5.3.5 Operation

 

Operation of Metal Transfer Experiment MTE-4 will begin with the addition
of rare-earth fluorides to the fluoride storage tank. Both stable rare
earths and tracer quantities of radicactive rare earths will be added.
During operation, the rate of removal of rare earths from the fluoride
salt and the concentration of rare earths at points throughout the
system will be determined by periodically taking samples of the various
phases. This data will permit evaluation of the effectiveness of
salt-metal contactors of various designs for transferring rare earths
between the salt and metal phases. The length of an experiment will
vary up to about a week depending on the operating conditions and the
rare earths used. After a run has been completed, the system will be
prepared for the next run either by adding additional rare earths to
the fluoride salt storage tank and reductant (lithium) to the Li-Bi
stripper or the rare earths used in the previous run can be transferred
from the Li-Bi solution to the fluoride salt by treating the two phases
with HF in the salt-metal hydrofluorination vessel.

Normally, the system will be kept at operating temperature between runs
with the normal charge of salt and metal in the system. For replacement
of the salt-metal contactor, the salt and bismuth will be drained from
the contactor into a drain tank. The salt-metal contactor and connecting
lines will be cooled to room temperature for maintenance or replacement.
Freeze valves and argon purges will be used to prevent air and moisture
from entering the remaining vessels when the lines to the contactor are
opened. During a complete shut down, salt and metal will be drained from
the salt-metal contactor, the Li-Bi stripper, and the salt-and-metal
hydroflucrination vessel into drain tanks before these vessels are

cooled down, since freezing of salt or bismuth in these vessels could
cause damage to the graphite or molybdenum liners. The salt will remain
in the fluoride salt storage vessel during a shutdown for maintenance.

Facility, and the Reductive Extraction Process Facility. Sampling tech-
niques will be developed for use with low bismuth concentrations in
fluoride salts. Tests to study the effectiveness of nickel wool beds

for removing entrained bismuth will be performed. Chemical studies to ws
identify the dissolved bismuth species will be carried out and methods

for removing these species will be developed.

of zirconium chloride dissolved in molten LiCl when the chloride melt
is in equilibrium with Li-Bi alloys or in equilibrium with HCl-H, mix-
tures. Initially, the oxidation state will be determined as a function
of the lithium concentration in the alloy. A special effort will be to
determine conditions under which gaseous zirconium chloride is present
at significant partial pressures above the LiCl solution. Some effort
will be devoted to determining activity coefficients for ZrCl, (or
ZrCly) in molten LiCl solution. Work in this task group is required for
determining the behavior of zirconium in actinide-recycle flowsheets
under consideration.

3.10.6 Task 2.7.2 Flowsheet analysis

 

3.10.6.1 Subtask 2.7.2.1 Heat balances

An existing general computer code will be used to calculate the amount
of decay heat release for each operation in the processing plant. This
is necessary to determine the heat transfer area required in each piece
of equipment. In some cases, the allowable heat release rate will limit
the fission product concentrations because of heat removal considera-
tions. Decay heat generation rates will be obtained from concentration
data determined in mass balance calculations.

3.10.6.2 Subtask 2.7.2.2 Mass balances

 

For the proposed flowsheet mass balance calculations will be made for
each fission product nuclide and for all transuranium isotopes. The
computer codes mentioned in the previous section will also be used
here. The mass balance calculations will be coupled with a calculation
for the reference reactor design in order that the effect of calculated
removal times and the effect of recycle of transuranium isotopes on the
reactor performance can be determined. All calculations will be con-
tinually updated as new process data (equilibria, mass transfer, etc.)
become available.

3-61

3.10.6.3 Subtask 2.7.2.3 Parametric studies ‘

The computer code which calculates mass balances, heat generation rates, i
and waste production rates will be used to do parametric studies in

order that modifications of the flowsheet will reflect an optimization

of the effect caused by each characteristic which is studied. Param-
eters to be varied include reductant concentrations, circulation rates,

and modifications of the flowsheet.

3.10.6.4 Subtask 2.7.2.4 Waste characterization

 

The material balance calculations using the previously mentioned com-
puter codes will be used to describe volumes and compositions of waste
streams associated with each proposed flowsheet. Waste disposal problems
associated with each flowsheet will be assessed from these calculations.

For each waste stream, calculations using the computer code ORIGEN will
be made to determine the activity and waste hazard as a function of time
and to compare waste hazards of MSBR's with waste hazards of other
reactors.

3.10.7 Task 2.7.3 Identification of required development

 

Analysis of flowsheets generated in this task will allow identification
of areas in which development work must be carried out in order to
assess the desirability and feasibility of the resultant flowsheets.

A report summarizing the results of this analysis and indicating the
required development work will be issued.

3.11 TASK GROUP 2.8 MSBR PROCESSING ENGINEERING LABORATORY
DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION

3.11.1 Objective

The objective of this task group is to provide space for engineering and
chemical development activities associated with the development of the
technology for processing the fuel from molten-salt breeder reactors.

The available work space for chemical and engineering development of
MSBR fuel reprocessing consists of one small alpha laboratory in Bldg.
3019; two standard chemical laboratories in Bldg. 4500; Bldg. 3592,
which has two equipment areas, each about 15 x 15 x 8 ft high; Bldg.
3541, equipped with three standard laboratory hoods and two walk-in
hoods; and Bldg. 4505, where two 6 x 8 x 26~-ft-high cell spaces have
been converted to permit experiments with beryllium salts; and a portion
of the high-bay area in Bldg. 7503 (MSRE building). These work areas
have been obtained by modifying existing facilities. The facilities
permit work with alpha materials in Bldg. 3019 and beryllium only in
3-62

all other areas. Change room entrances and other provisions are mar-
ginal for all areas except Bldg. 3541 and Bldg. 7503. The existing
facilities are adequate only for limited alpha laboratory work, small
bench-scale engineering tests of individual system components, and tests
of 1/2-scale individual process equipment units. None of the engineer-
ing facilities will permit proof-testing with alpha-active materials or
demonstration of a complete processing plant system, even on a very
small scale. Full-scale testing of the complete processing system with
molten salt and bismuth, alpha materials, and perhaps low-level beta=-
gamma radioactive tracers will be required tc demonstrate process per-
formance. The existing facilities are crowded, are inefficient because
of the assignment of personnel to widely separated facilities, and are
completely inadequate for the planned development program. No other
facilities exist at the Laboratory that could meet the specific and
unique requirements for engineering development of MSBR processing.

Engineering-scale experiments planned for the facility will range in
complexity from simple test loops for pump and valve development for
molten salt or bismuth systems to a full-scale integrated processing
equipment installation for operation with low-level beta-gamma tracers
and alpha materials.

3.13.2 Schedule

The schedule for Task Group 2.8, MSBR Processing Engineering Laboratory
Design and Construction, is given in Table 3.11.2.

3.11.3 Funding

The operating budget for Task Group 2.8 is shown in Table 3.11.3. This
task will require GPP funds of about $12,000,000, to be authorized in
FY 1977.

3.11.4 Task 2.8.1 Conceptual design

 

This project will consist of a new building which will be capable of
containing laboratory and large-scale engineering experiments with
beryllium and thorium compounds and alpha-emitting materials. The
building will be a three-story concrete and masonry building with a
metal high-bay area. Overall dimensions will be 125 ft by 152 ft by
45 ft high. The high-bay area will be 45 ft high. An 18 ft by 32 ft
by 15 ft truck air lock will be provided in the high-bay area. The
building, plus air lock, will have a gross floor area of 33,000 fr?
and a gross volume of about 800,000 ft3, Portions of the building
will be sealed and operated at a negative pressure of 6.3 im. H,0 to
provide suitable containment of hazardous materials,

Task 2.8.1 consists of establishing (1) the criteria for the building;
(2) preparing a safety analysis and an environmental statement; (3) de-
veloping preliminary site preparation plans, floor plams, architectural

and structural plans, utility plans, and waste disposal plans; (4) pre-
paring a cost estimate for the project; and (5) preparing and submitting
a long form construction project data sheet for FY 1977 project author-
ization.

3.11.5 Task 2.8.2 Title I design

 

Title I design for the building will begin after project authorization
in FY 1977. This work represents the first definitive design work and
must be completed before construction starts in order to verify the
conceptual design, the scope of the project, and the estimate of project
cost. Operating fund requirements during Title I design cover 5 to 6
personnel, including the program and project engineers; design work not
covered by capital funds; advance procurement, estimating, and liason
between the program and project activities.

3.11.6 Task 2.8.3 Title 11 design

 

Title II design will start immediately after the Title I design has been
completed. This effort defines the construction activities to be under-
taken and some construction, such as site preparation, will begin before
completion of Title II design. Operating funds are required during
Title II design for purposes similar to those discussed above for Title
I design.

3.11.7 Task 2.8.4 Construction

 

Construction will begin in mid FY 1978 and continue through FY 1980.
This period includes the time required for acceptance tests. Operating
funds are required for support of the project and program engineers.

3.11.8 Task 2.8.5 Acceptance of facility

 

All equipment in the facility must be tested before the facility will
be accepted. These systems tests will take place during the last three
months of construction.

3.12 TASK GROUP 2.9 INTEGRATED PROCESS TEST FACILITY

3.12.1 Objective

The objective of this task group is to provide a facility for the demon-
stration of processes and equipment for fuel processing at the pilot
plant level in a nonradioactive system. This facility is needed (1) to
demonstrate the safety and performance reliability of processing systems,
(2) to provide information for development of maintenance methods, and
3-66

(3) to provide a basis for evaluation of continuous, on-site processing

of MSBR fuel salt. Information will be obtained that is necessary for

the development of overall plant design for molten-salt reactor process-
ing systems. No viable alternative MSBR fuel processing development
facilities exist, and this facility cennot be deferred if the fuel proc-
essing data and plant design information are to be available on a schedule
allowing the timely development of molten-salt breeder reactors.

3.12.2 Schedule

The schedule for this task group is shown in Table 3.12.2.

3.12.3 Funding

The operating budget for this task group is shown in Table 3.12.3.1.
Authorization of capital funds in the amount of $7,000,00Q will be
required during FY 1978. Capital equipment fund requirements are shown
in Table 3.12.3.2.

3.12.4 Facilities

The Integrated Process Test Facility will consist of the equipment neces-
sary for the simultaneous operation of all parts of a processing system
for study and demonstration of continuous processing of molten-salt
breeder reactor fuel salt on a scale that is 25% to 75% of that required
for a 1000-MW(e) MSBR. Operation of the system will be carried out using
tracer-level activity suitable for determining the behavior of key acti-
nide and fission product elements. The operations to be tested include
fluorination of fuel salt for removal of uranium, reductive extraction
for removal of protactinium, rare-earth removal by the metal transfer
process, and reconstitution of MSBR fuel salt from UFg recovered in the
flucrination operation and the processed fuel carrier salt. The total
estimated cost for the Integrated Process Test Facility is $7 million

and authorization is required during 1978.

3.12.5 Task 2.9.1 Definition of experimental program and
preliminary design

 

The experimental program will be defined and the facility will be de-
signed accordingly. Preliminary design of this facility will consist
of a choice of the scale of the equipment, identification of auxiliary
equipment (gas supplies, excess reagent and waste disposal systems,
instrumentation calibration stations, etc.), location of equipment,
and preliminary sketching and layout of equipment. The areas where
further development will be required for completion of final design
will be identified. Experimental programs to carry out this develop-
ment will be planned.

4, TFUEL-PROCESSING MATERIALS DEVELOPMENT

4.1 INTRODUCTION

The materials requirements for MSBR fuel processing systems depend upon

the particular process operation considered and the design of the specific
equipment for effecting this operation. The most important operations
consist in (1) removing fission products, (2) isolating 233Pa during its
decay to 233y, and (3) removing excess uranium for sale. Processes in-
volving uranium removal by fluorination and selective chemical reduction

of protactinium and fission products from the fuel salt into liquid bismuth
appear to be the most promising process methods currently available.

4.1.1 Objective

The objectives of the fuel-processing materisls development program are
to identify materials capable of satisfactorily containing the fluids
present in an MSBR fuel processing system, and to develop the materials
technology necessary for constructing a processing system. It should be
clearly recognized that a satisfactory resolution of materials problems
will probably involve the use of several materials as discussed below.

4.1.2 Scope

The scope of this program consists in identifying materials which are
compatible with the fluids present in a fuel processing system, and
conducting fabrication and joining studies to provide information re-
quired for construction of processing systems.

4.1.2.1 Task Group 3.1 Identification of corrosion resistant
materials

 

Compatibility tests will be conducted with MSBR fuel salt, Bi-Li-Th
solutions, and LiCl under conditions which simulate fuel processing
systems in order to identify satisfactory containment materials for
the various process steps.

4.1.2.2 Task Group 3.2 Development of fabrication and joining
techniques

 

Based on information obtained in Task Group 3.1, materials will be
selected for fabrication of MSBR fuel processing experiments and systems.
Fabrication and joining studies will be conducted as required in order
to (1) develop fabrication procedures, (2) determine optimum fabrication
variables, and (3) develop a basis for improving present procedures.
4-2

4.1.2.3 Task Group 3.3 Construction of fuel processing experiments

 

and systems
Once the general details for a fuel processing experiment or system have =
been fixed, materials and fabrication procedures for construction of the
associated equipment will be selected and qualified. In some cases, proto-
typic construction of components using data obtained in Task Group 3.2 a
will be required.
4,2 PROGRAM BUDGET AND SCHEDULE -
4.2.1 Schedule and key program milestones i»

 

The schedule for work on fuel processing materials development is shown

in Table 4.2.1.1. The key program milestones associated with the develop-

ment of fuel processing materials are listed in Table 4.2.1.2 and occur at wi
the times indicated in Table 4.2.1.1.

 

4.2.2 Funding -
Operating fund requirements for work on fuel processing materials develop- i
ment are shown in Table 4.2.2.1, and capital equipment fund requirements =
are shown in Table 4.2.2.2.
4.3 MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS, BACKGROUND, AND STATUS OF DEVELOPMENT
4.3.1 Materials requirements da
In the reference fuel processing flowsheet a number of environments are
present: i
1. Molten salt and gaseous mixtures of F, and UFg at 300 to 550°C.
2. Molten salt and bismuth containing lithium and thorium at 55C to Gi
650°C.
3. Bismuth containing 5 to 50 at. % Li and LiCl at 550 to 650°C. i
4. HF-H, mixtures and molten fluorides at 550 to 650°C.

One of the principal requirements of a material (or materials) to be used
in constructing fuel processing components is compatibility with the en-
vironment which the component will encounter. It is not necessary that a
single material be compatible with all of the environments since the system Gi
can be designed to allow for segregation of a given environment to a par-
ticular portion of the system. It is expected that at least two classes
of materials will be necessary: one that can be used in the fluorinatiecn
and fuel reconstitution steps and another for the reductive-extraction
4-3

portions of the system. A fundamental requirement of the materials
selected is fabricability, for ultimately the materials must be used in
the construction of commercial processing plants. Availability and cost
are also important factors that must be considered.

4.3.2 Background

Nickel or a nickel-base alloy, which in some cases must be protected from
corrosion by a layer of frozen salt, can be used for construction of fluo-
rinators for removal of uranium from molten fluoride mixtures, and for
those portions of a plant that will contain F,, UFg, and HF. The chemical
corrosion of nickel and nickel-base alloys during fluorination operations
has been evaluated previously at ORNL. Much of this information has
evolved from fuel recovery operations conducted with irradiated metallic
reactor fuel elements using molten fluoride mixtures in which UF, was
converted to UFg by contact with fluorine. During these studies, a num-
ber of materials were exposed to gaseous fluorine and molten salt. Most
of the data were obtained during operation! of two plant-scale fluori-
nators constructed of L-nickel at temperatures ranging from 520 to 730°C
which contained a number of corrosion specimens (20 different materials).
Several specimens had lower rates of maximum corrosive attack than L-
nickel, and the specimen showing the least attack, Hymu 80, had a maxi-
mum bulk loss rate of 11 mils/month based on total time in molten salt.
Other corrosion coupon tests at 600°C showed that INOR-1 is alsc more
resistant to corrosion than L-nickel.? Although these materials exhibit
better corrosion resistance than L-nickel, this material should have
acceptable corrosion behavior if protected by a frozen-salt layer and

is preferred for use in MSBR processing plants since corrosion of the
other materials introduces volatile fluorides of chromium and molybdenum
into the fluorinator offgas.

The previous fuel recovery operations afford useful guidelines and back-
ground information for the selection of materials for the proposed proc—
ess applications. They also show the importance, however, of inerting
the metal surfaces in a fluorinator with a passive frozen-salt layer.

In addition to compatibility evaluations, many years of experience have
been accumulated in the fabrication and joining of this class of alloys,
stemming from the construction of reactors and associated hardware? as
well as fluoride-salt purification equipment.

For those portions of the process system that will be in contact with
bismuth or bismuth sclutions, conventional materials of construction
such as Fe-, Co-, or Ni-base alloys are not acceptable because of either
(1) excessively high solubility in bismuth or (2) a tendency to undergo
mass transfer when exposed to bismuth in a system having a temperature
gradient, Materials which have shown good compatibility with bismuth
include graphite and refractory metals such as tungsten, rhenium, molyb-
denum and tantalum,.3~® Except for tantalum, all of these materials are
difficult to fabricate and join. All oxidize rapidly in air at process
temperatures and require some type of atmospheric protection.

4.3.3 Status of development

 

For the past several years, materials have been investigated that can

be used to contain Bi-Li-Th solutions at temperatures ranging from 530 to
700°C. These studies have been concentrated on molybdenum and molybdenum
alloys, tantalum and tantalum alloys, and graphite. It currently appears
that the use of graphite for vessels and molybdenum or molybdenum alloys
for interconnecting lines, agitators, and other components represents

the optimum combination of available materials.

4.3.3.1 Molybdenum

The selection of molybdenum as a potential processing plant material was
based on corrosion investigations at ORNL3 and elsewhere“:> which showed
it to resist dissolution and chemical attack in molten bismuth. The
studies at ORNL were conducted in both static capsules and small thermal
convection loops which provided a temperature gradient of 100 to 200°C
in the bismuth circuit. Tests were conducted on low-carbon molybdenum
and the alloy TZM in pure bismuth and bismuth containing up to 3 wt %
(50 at. %) Li. Mass tansfer of these materials was negligible in the
temperature range 500 to 700°C for periods as long as 10,000 hr. Tests
carried out in static bismuth also have shown nc effect of stress on the
corrosion rate for molybdenum.

Although molybdenum has excellent resistance to corrosion, there are
difficulties associated with its use. Molybdenum is a particularly
structure-sensitive material; that is, its mechanical properties are
known to vary widely, depending upon how it has been metallurgically
processed. The ductile-brittle transition temperature for molybdenum
varies from below room temperature to 200-300°C, depending both upon
strain rate and the microstructure of the metal. Maximum ductility

is provided in the cold-worked, fine-grained condition. Recent advances
in vacuum-melting practices have led to the production of material with
improved and more reproducible metallurgical properties. The arc-melted,
low-carbon, low-oxygen grade of molybdenum, available commercially,
affords relatively good control of grain size and interstitial impurity
level. Nevertheless, the use of molybdenum as a structural material
requires highly specialized assembly procedures and imposes stringent
limitations on system design from the standpoint of geometry and
rigidity.

Several advances in the fabrication technology of molybdenum were made
at ORNL during construction of a molybdenum system in which bismuth and
molten salt could be countercurrently contacted in a l-in.~ID, 5-ft-high
packed column having 3.5-in.-ID upper and lower disengaging sections.’
Techniques were developed for the production of closed-end molybdenum
vessels by back extrusion, which involves the flow of metal into a die
and the backward flow of metal over an advancing plunger. This fabri-
cation process has the advantage that the diameter of the part produced
Ee

4-9

is as large as or larger than that of the starting metal blank; the con-
figuration of the part can be changed by relatively simple changes in

the die and mandrel design; and sufficient deformation can be accomplished
that a wrought or fine-grained structure having good mechanical properties
is produced. Parts that were free from cracks and had high-quality sur-
faces were produced consistently with this technique by the use of ZrG,-
coated plungers and dies and extrusion temperatures of 1600 to 1700°C.
Eleven closed-end forgings were produced that had a 3-7/8-in. outside
diameter, a 3.5~in. inside diameter, and lengths from 8 to 12 in. The
3.5-ft-long molybdenum pipe for the extraction column, having an outside
diameter of 1.16 in. and an inside diameter of 1 in., was produced by
floating mandrel extrusion at 1600°C. Three extrusions for producing

this material were performed; the second extrusion produced a pipe

11.5 ft in length that was concentric to within 0.007 in. with ex~

cellent external and internal surfaces.

In evaluating three sizes of commercially available molybdenum tubing
(1/4-, 3/8-, and 1/2-in. OD), it was found that the 1/2-in. tubing was
ductile at room temperature, while the 3/8-in. tubing was ductile only
at temperatures above 150 to 250°C and the 1/4-in. tubing was ductile
only at temperatures above 300°C. It was found, however, that the
3/8-in. and 1/4-in. tubing could be made ductile at room temperature
by the removal of 0.001 to 0.003 in. of material from the inside of
the tubing by etching. Further investigation showed that tubing which
is ductile at room temperature should be produced routinely by careful
control of surface contamination during tubing fabrication.

It was also demonstrated that complex components can be fabricated from
molybdenum by welding, using either the gas tungsten-arc or electron-

beam processes.’ Welding procedures were developed to deal with the
inherent tendencies of molybdenum toward hot cracking due to contami-
nation (such as from 0, or N,) as well as abnormal grain growth, which
results in welds that are brittle at room temperature. Mechanical tube-
to-header joints were also produced by pressure bonding, using commerical
tube expanders. Tubes which were rolled into headers at 250°C remained
leak-tight after repeated thermal cycling to 300°C. Welding studies

have centered on three major types of joint: tube-to-tube sheet, tube-
to~tube, and 3.5-in.-diam circumferential girth welds. Electron-beam

and gas tungsten-arc welding techniques both have been investigated. In
addition, a commercial orbiting-arc welding head was modified to produce
helium leak-tight (5 x 10-8 atm cm3/sec) tube~to~tube field welds. Two

of the most important factors found to minimize molybdenum weldment crack-
ing have been stress relieving of components and preheating prior to welding.

Although helium leak-tight molybdenum welds have been produced consistently
using both the electron-beam and tungsten-arc techniques, the ductile-
brittle transition of the resulting welds were above room temperature, and
it was necessary to design each joint te mechanically support the welds.
The joints were also back-brazed or vapor plated with tungsten to provide
a secondary barrier against leakage.

Studies have been carried out for the development of braze materials for
Joining molybdenum that are resistant to corrosion by bismuth and molten
salts.” An iron-base alloy of the composition Fe-Mo-Ge-C-B (75-13-5-4-1
wt 7%) has been found to have good wetting and flow properties, a moder-
ately low brazing temperature (<1200°C), and adequate resistance to
corrosion by bismuth at 650°C.

The results of work to date on molybdenum fabrication techniques have
been quite encouraging, and it is believed that the material can be used
in constructing components for processing systems if proper attention is
given to its fabrication characteristics.

4.3.3.2 Tantalum

Corrosion tests in molten bismuth and Bi-Li solutions have been conducted

with pure tantalum and the tantalum alloy T-111 (8% W, 2% Hf, bal Ta).
In quartz thermal-convection loops at 700°C, the mass transfer rate of
pure tantalum in these liquid metals was greater than that of molybdenum,
although the rate was still less than 3 mils/year. Mass transfer rates
for the alloy T-111 were comparable to those for molybdenum, but the
mechanical properties of T-111 were strongly affected by interaction of
the alloy with interstitial impurities, primarily oxygen, in quartz--
pure-bismuth loop experiments. A more recent test carried out at 700°C
with a Bi-2.5 wt 7 Li mixture in a loop constructed of T-111 tubing did
not measurably affect the mechanical properties of the T-111l, and the
mass transfer rate was again insignificant.

The resistance of tantalum or T-11ll1 to corrosion by fuel salt is unknown
at this time, but it appears marginal from thermodynamic considerations.

However, tantalum should withstand attack by molten LiCl, and experiments

are planned to investigate this.

Several complex assemblies have been fabricated at ORNL using the T-111

alloy, the largest of which was a forced convection loop which circulated

liguid lithium for 3000 hr at 1370°C.% In contrast to molybdenum, this

alloy is quite ductile in the as-welded condition; thus it appears promis-

ing for complex geometries that would operate principally in Bi or Bi-Li
solutions. The tantalum alloy, however, would require a higher degree

of protection from interstitial impurities (0, C, N) than would molybdenum.

4.3.3.3 Graphite

Graphite, which has excellent compatibility with fuel salt, also shows
promise for the containment of bismuth. Compatibility tests to date
have shown no evidence of chemical interaction between graphite and
bismuth containing up to 3 wt % (50 at. %Z) Li. However, the largest
open pores of most commercially available polycrystalline graphites

are penetrated to some extent by liquid bismuth. Static capsule tests®
of three commercial graphites (ATJ, AXF-5QBG, and Graphitite A) were

 

 
4-11

conducted for 500 hr at 700°C using both high-purity bismuth and Bi-3

wt Z (50 at. %) Li. Although penetration by pure bismuth was negligible,
the addition of lithium to the bismuth appeared to increase the depth

of permeation and, presumably altered the wetting characteristics of

the bismuth.

Although it is not known whether limited penetration of graphite by
bismuth solutions is tolerable, there are several approaches that have
potential for decreasing the extent to which a porous graphite is pene-
trated by bismuth and bismuth-lithium alloys. Two well-established
approaches are multiple impregnations with liquid hydrocarbons which
are then carbonized and/or graphitized and (2) pyrocarbon coatings.
Other approaches are based on vapor-deposited molybdenum coatings, and
the use of carbide—-forming sealants. Each of these sealing approaches
is being evaluated. The wetting characteristics of graphite are also
being studied as a function of surface pretreatments such as dedusting,
alcohol wash and oven dry, and vacuum degassing at 700 to 1000°C.

Fabrication of a precessing plant from graphite would necessitate
graphite-to~graphite and graphite-to-metal joints. Development
studies?:10 have been conducted on both types of joints using high-
temperature brazes and also metals which bond by carbide formation.
Several of these experimental joining techniques show promise for the
chemical processing application. Other workers!l,12 have pioneered
mechanical joints which may be satisfactory for the proposed application.

4.3.4 Basis for materials selection

 

It is expected that a combination of the above materials would be used in
the construction of a fuel processing system. Although tantalum alloys
present few engineering developmental problems, it is expected that com-
patibility with molten fluorides and susceptibility to environmental con-
tamination may limit their use. From an engineering view, the use of
graphite would require less development work than molybdenum and, there-
fore, major emphasis will be placed on studies with graphite for the near
term. The work outlined for the longer term, however, allows for more
complete development of these materials for more extensive processing
applications. Near-term compatibility results and fuel processing flow-
sheet developments will dictate the extent to which subsequent work will
be undertaken for each of the materials.

4.4 TASK GROUP 3.1 DETERMINATION OF CORROSION-RESISTANT MATERIALS

Bidg. 9201-3 — Forced-circulation loops will be conducted on the
cperating floor of this building. es
4.4.5 Task 3.1.1 Compatibility of molybdenum with molten salts a
and Bi-Li-Th solutions
4.4,5.1 Subtask 3.1.1.1 Thermal-convection loop test in molten salt I.
The corrosion of molybdenum in moltem salt can probably be described
by the reaction:
UF, (d) + 1/6Mo(s) = UF3(d) + 1/6MoFg(g) .
When compared with fluorides of other elements present in the system, Gi
MoFg is relatively unstable, and it seems unlikely that any serious
attack of molybdenum by the fuel carrier salt will occur. To verify
this hypothesis, a thermal convection loop test will be constructed of .

molybdenum and operated with fuel carrier salt at a maximum temperature
of 700°C and a temperature difference of approximately 100°C. Test cou-
pons and tensile samples will be included in both hot and cold sections.
In addition to mechanical properties changes, evaluation of leop compo- fii
nents will be obtained from weight-change measurements, chemical analyses,

and metallographic examination.

4.4.5.2 Subtask 3.1.1.2 Forced-circulation loop test with Bi-Li-Th
solutions

Previous thermal-convection loop tests have shown that molybdenum is
compatible with Bi-Li solutions under dynamic conditions. Additional
forced-~circulation loop tests will allow further testing under conditions
more closely simulating processing conditions, and a molybdenum loop will
be constructed as a test-bed facility. The design of the loop will allow
for removal of samples that will be exposed under varying conditions.
Solutions of Bi-Li-Th containing fission product elements will be circu-
lated at varigble flow rates, and corrosion rates of molybdenum will be
determined as a function of flow rate, fluid composition, and temperature
difference.

4.4.5.3 Subtask 3.1.1.3 Corrosion tests of molybdenum-coated components

The coating of conventional materials such as iron- or nickel-base alloys
with molybdenum, which does not require complicated fabrication and join-
ing procedures, has been under consideration as a technique for providing
resistance to corrosion by Bi~Li solutions. Two types of coating proc-
esses have been investigated thus far: chemical~vapor deposition by
hydrogen reduction of MoFg and deposition from molten-salt mixtures con-
taining MoFg by chemical reaction with the substrate. The latter method
looks especially promising because more complicated components could
probably be coated using this approach. Investigations of coating proc-
esses and variables will be continued. The r effectiveness can best be
determined from compatibility tests in Bi-Li solution. Both static and
thermal-convection loop tests will be conducted and evaluation will con-
sist primarily of chemical analyses of the solutions and metallographic
examination of the coated samples.

4.4.6 Task 3.1.2 Compatibility of graphite with Bi-Li-Th solutions

4.4.6.1 Subtask 3.1.2.) Penetration of graphite as a function of
lithium concentration and type of graphite

 

 

The purpose of this subtask is to determine the types of graphite that
will be satisfactory for use in constructing fuel processing systems and
experiments which contain Bi-Li solutions. Compatibility tests have shown
that bismuth and Bi-Li solutions penetrate the accessible porosity of some
graphites, and in several tests with low-quality graphite Bi-Li solutions
have penetrated the graphite completely. Capsule tests will be continued
te determine the extent of penetration as a function of time, graphite
pore size, graphite density, and the concentrations of lithium and fission
product elements in Bi-Li sclutions. The effectiveness of liquid impreg-
nation, pyrolytic coatings, and refractory-metal coatings for reducing

the extent of penetration will be evaluated. Studies will also be carried
out in which graphites that are permeated by bismuth solutions are thermal
cycled over a temperature range including the solution solidus temperature
in order to determine the allowable extent of permeation.

4-19

4.4.6.2 Subtask 3.1.2.2 Studies to determine whether Bi-Li-Th
solutions interact chemically with graphite

Some materials react with graphite to form lamellar or intercalation
compounds. These compounds are formed by chemical interaction at the
edge of the carbon layer planes and diffusion of the reactant into the
graphite between the layer planes. Compounds of this type are known

to form with a large number of salts, a few oxides, fluorine, chlorine,
bromine, potassium, rubidium, and cesium.13-15 Experiments conducted
thus far have not shown intercalation compound formation with Bi-Li
solutions at 650°C. Studies will be continued to investigate the effect
of temperature and the presence of fission product elements such as
cesium in Bi-Li solutions on intercalation compound formation. Studies
will also be carried out for determining the extent to which elements
dissolved in bismuth interact with graphite to form metal carbides, and
for observing the effect of carbide formation on the properties of the
base graphite.

4.4.6.3 Subtask 3.1.2.3 Determination of the solubility of carbon
in Bi-Li solutions

 

The solubility of carbon in bismuth has been reported!® to be <5 ppm at
750°C. In a thermal-convection-loop test in which graphite was in contact
with Bi-100 ppm Li for 3000 hr at 700°C (max) and with a 100°C temperature
difference between the hot and cold legs, corrosion and mass transfer
were not significant. However, recent capsule test results at 650°C

have indicated significantly higher carbon solubilities in Bi-3 wt Z Li.
Because rapid mass transfer kinetics have been observed in bismuth sys—
tems with materials having solubilities ranging from 50 to 100 ppm, it

is important that the solubility of carbon in Bi-Li solutions be more
accurately determined. One important factor in the determination is pro-
tection of the Bi-Li samples from exposure to air following equilibration
with graphite. When lithium is exposed to air, a surface product believed
to be LiyCO3 results. Thus, spuriously high carbon values can be obtained
if proper sampling and analysis techniques are not used. Samples of var-
ious types of graphite will be exposed to Bi-100 wt ppm Li, Bi-1 wt Z Li,
Bi-2 wt % Li and Bi-3 wt % Li for 1000 and 3000 hr at 650°C. Carbon
concentrations in the melt will be determined as a function of Li con-
centration, equilibration time, and type of graphite.

4.4.6.4 Subtask 3.1.2.4 Thermal-convection loop tests with Bi-Li
solutions

One of the principal compatibility problems between graphite and bismuth
is mass transfer in systems having a temperature gradient. Rapid kinetics
of dissolution and deposition have resulted in significant mass transfer
of iron and niobium even though their solubilities in bismuth are only
50-100 ppm at 600 to 700°C. If the solubility of graphite is appreciable
in bismuth containing 2 to 3 wt %Z Li, mass transfer of graphite may be a
4-20

significant problem. Graphite samples will be evaluated initially in a
molybdenum thermal-convection loop in which Bi-3 wt Z Li will be circulated
at a 700°C maximum temperature. When satisfactory joining procedures have
been developed, a graphite loop will be constructed and the test will be
repeated with a Bi-3 wt 7 Li solution. Tests will be continued to eval-
uate several grades of graphite using Bi-Li solutions, which in some

 

cases will contain fission-product elements. =
4.4.6.5 Subtask 3.1.2.5 Forced-circulation loop tests with Bi~Li a
solutions

These tests will be an extension of those described above in Subtask

3.1.2.4. The approach will be to construct a graphite loop test-bed =
facility in which samples of various types of graphite can be included.

Variables will include flow rate, temperature difference, and composition

of the Bi-Li solutions. Fo]

4.4.7 Task 3.1.3 Compatibility of tantalum and tantalum alloys with i
molten salts and Bi-Li solutions

 

4.4.7.1 Subtask 3.1.3.1 Thermal-convection loop test with molten salt

 

The thermodynamic stability of TaF, at 600-700°C is comparable to that of
CrF,. Since the activity of tantalum in unalloyed tantalum or Ta-10%Z W
is higher than that of chromium in Hastelloy N, its corrosion rate will
probably be somewhat higher for a given redox potential than that for
chromium, and the rate of attack will not be diffusion limited as would
be the case for attack of chromium in Hastelloy N. A series of thermal-
convection loop tests will be carried out to evaluate tantalum and tanta-
lum alloys. Initially, a loop will be constructed of the alloy 90% Ta-10%
W which will be used to circulate MSBR fuel carrier salt at a maximum
temperature of 700°C with a temperature difference of approximately 100°C.
Tabular and tensile specimens will be included in both the hot- and cold-
leg sections. Evaluation will consist of weight and mechanical proper-
ties changes, chemical analyses, and metallographic examination. Addi-
tional tests as indicated will be conducted in which time and alloy
material are varied.

rates were low (comparable to those for molybdenum). If the results from
tests with Ta=10%Z W in molten salt are promising (Subtask 3.1.3.1) a
thermal-convection loop will be constructed of Ta-10%Z W to circulate
Bi-2.5 wt % Li at 700°C (maximum) with a 100°C temperature difference.
Test coupons and tensile specimens will be included in both hot and cold
sections. In addition to mechanical properties changes, evaluation of
components will be made by weight change measurements, chemical analyses,
and metallographic examination. Additional tests will be necessary to
evaluate the effect of Bi-~Li composition including the addition of
fission product elements.

4.4.7.4 Subtask 3.1.3.4 Forced-circulation loop tests with Bi-Li-Th
solutions

 

Forced-circulation loop tests using Bi-Li-Th solutions will be required

to more closely simulate processing conditions. A tantalum alloy lecop
(probably Ta-10% W) will be constructed as a test-bed facility in which
removable samples can be exposed under varying conditions. Solutions of
Bi-1i-Th containing fission product elements will be circulated at variable
flow rates. Corrosion rates of tantalum alloys will be measured as a
function of solution composition, flow rate, temperature, and temperature
difference.

4.4.8 Task 3.1.4 Compatibility of braze alloys with molten salts
and Bi-Li-Th solutions

 

 

Brazing will be a very important joining process in making graphite-to-

. graphite, graphite-to-molybdenum and, perhaps, molybdenum-to-molybdenum

joints. Although it is likely that some portions of a processing plant
will require brazed-joint construction, the use of tantalum alloys will
not be as dependent on development of a braze alloy because tantalum
alloys are more readily weldable than other potential materials of con-
struction. One of the major requirements of a braze alloy is compati-
bility with molten salt and Bi-Li~Th sclutions. In addition, for joints
involving molybdenum, the melting point of the braze alloy should be low
enough that molybdenum, which is structure sensitive, does not recrystal-
lize during brazing. Alloys of Fe-C-B-Mo-Ge have shown promise for this
application. Braze alloys for graphite generally consist of metals or
alloys that are strong carbide formers such as molybdenum or titanium,
but work with these materials has been limited.

4,4,8.1 Subtask 3.1.4.1 Capsule tests

 

Initial brazed-joint evaluation will consist of exposure of samples to
salt mixtures or Bi-Li solutions in isothermal capsules, and this type
of screening evaluation will eliminate alloys which show little promise.
Conditions such as time, temperature and composition of the fluids will
be varied.

4.4.8.2 Subtask 3.1.4.2 Thermal-convection loop tests

 

Braze alloys which show promise in the screening compatibility tests
will be evaluated further im the thermal-convection loop tests described
in Subtasks 3.1.1.1, 3.1.2.4, and 3.1.3.1. Initially, brazed-joint test
coupons will be evaluated, but subsequently, loops will be constructed
with brazed joints and these will be evaluated as a function of braze-
alloy composition, time, and fluid composition.

4,4,8.3 Subtask 3.1.4.3 Forced-circulation loop tests

 

This is an extension of Subtask 3.1.4.2, above. Brazed joints will be
included as samples in several sections of the test-bed loops described
in Subtasks 3.1.1.2, 3.1.2.5, and 3.1.3.2. The variables to be studied
will consist of temperature, temperature difference, time, flow velocity,
and composition of the fluid.

4.5.5 Task 3.2.1 Fabrication development of molybdenum and molybdenum
alloys

The objective of this task is to evaluate the existing processes for
fabrication of molybdenum and to develop improved methods and materials
that will facilitate the use of molybdenum or molybdenum alloys in fuel
processing systems.

4.5.5.1 Subtask 3.2.1.1 Effect of very low concentrations of oxygen
and carbon on deformation behavior

Very little work has been published on the effects of very low concen-
trations of oxygen and carbon on the deformation behavior of molybdenum.
Recent advances in melting technology have resulted in production of very-
high-purity base metal which causes variations in the required parameters
for deformation. The levels of both oxygen and carbon dictate the tem-
perature required for forming and the forces that are necessary. Impurity
levels also have an effect on grain size of the starting blank which in
turn changes the fabrication parameters. The effects of impurity levels
will be studied by extrusion, back extrusion and tube drawing of selected
heats of material, and by comparison of the fabrication parameters required
for each material. Products will be evaluated visually and metallograph-
ically to determine grain size and microstructure.
4-30

4.5.5.2 Subtask 3.2.1.2 Effect of fabrication processes and variables
on mechanical properties

 

In order to assist in the design and construction of molybdenum components
for processing systems, it will be necessary to investigate the effect

of fabrication processes and variables on mechanical properties. Little
mechanical properties data is available on molybdenum product forms except a
for small diameter rod and sheet. This effort will use extrusion, back
extrusion and tube drawing to produce a wide range of specimens for
evaluation. Fabrication variables will include forming temperatures,
deformation rates and in-process heat treatment. Mechanical properties
tests will include measurements of toughness, tensile strength, and duc-
tility as a function of temperature and strain rate.

 

 

4,5.5.3 Subtask 3.2.1.3 Grain size control during secondary

fabrication processes a
Fine-grained molybdenum generally is easier to fabricate and has better
mechanical properties than material having a larger grain size. In order ws

to facilitate making molybdenum components for processing systems, it will

be necessary to carry out studies on the control of grain size during

secondary fabrication. Rotary forging of large-diameter pipe, back ex-

trusion of shapes, and tube drawing will be used in the study. The effort a
will be of much wider scope than that used previously on the production

of commerical arc-cast tubing.’

4.5.5.4 Subtask 3.2.1.4 Molvdenum alloying studies to improve
ductility of base material

 

Little, if any, work has been published on the alloying of molybdenum to

improve ductility because most work has been directed towards increasing

the base-metal strength. This effort will evaluate the effectiveness of at
small alloying additions for cleaning up grain boundaries and controlling

grain size. Elements such as yttrium, hafnium, titanium, and zirconium

have sometimes proved effective as oxygen and carbon scavengers. Rare~ EE
earth and boron additions have been reported!’ to improve crack resistance.
The addition of rhenium improves the ductility of molybdenum considerably,
and the alloy Mo-50%7 Re is reasonably fabricable and weldable. However,
high cost and limited availability of rhenium make this alloy less desir-
able. Alloys containing small concentrations of rhenium in combination
with other elements such as those discussed above will be investigated.

4.5.6 Task 3.2.2 Fabrication development of tantalum and tantalum
allo y Ss a

Tantalum and tantalum-base alloys are not considered to be difficult to
fabricate because of their good ductility. After a particular tantalum-
base alloy has been selected for use in fuel processing systems, work in
i

4-31

tliis subtask will be carried out to review fabrication process methods
and to determine optimum process parameters. In addition, the effect of
surface contamination during forming and fabrication will be determined.
The effect of surface coatings used for beth protection and lubrication
during forming will be evaluated by chemical analysis and changes in
mechanical properties. Methods of fabrication will include extrusion,
rolling, and drawing. Minor base-metal and alloy additions will be in-
vestigated to determine whether they improve fabrication parameters and
products.

4.5.7 Task 3.2.3 Fabrication development of graphite

 

The main fabrication problem associated with graphite for this application
is making it impervious to penetration by Bi-Li solutions. Since the
graphite used in chemical processing systems will not be exposed to signif-
icant neutron fluences, graphites of poor crystalline perfection can be
used. Rather than making the entire graphite body impervious, the fabri-
cated components will be surface sealed by liquid or gaseous impregnation.

4.5.7.1 Subtask 3.2.3.1 Evaluation of the resistance of commercially
available graphites to penetration by bismuth-lithium solutions

 

Compatibility tests have shown that Bi-Li solutions will penetrate the
open porosity of some types of graphite while high-density, low-porosity
graphites almost completely resist penetration. Determination of the

type of graphite required for fuel processing experiments and plant con-
struction is the objective of Subtask 3.1.2.1. Based on results from that
work, commercial graphite that is available in the size ranges that are
required for fuel processing applications will be evaluated by exposure

to Bi-Li solutions. Since pore size and pore accessibility of commercial
graphites often vary considerably, one important factor in this study will
be a statistical determination of the variability of these characteristics
for a particular grade of graphite.

4.5.7.2 Subtask 3.2.3.2 Development and evaluation of procedures to
reduce bismuth penetration in commerical graphite

If commercially available graphites do not adequately resist penetration
by Bi-Li solutions, suitable sealing procedures will be developed. Empha-
sis will be on conventional techniques that can be used by vendors during
fabrication or that are adaptable to complex system designs. The sealing
techniques of interest would primarily include liquid hydrocarbon impreg-
nation methods.
4-32

4.5.8 Task 3.2.4 Joining of molybdenum and molybdenum alloys

 

The objective of this subtask is to evaluate existing processes for join-
ing molybdenum and to develop improved techniques and materials that will
facilitate the use of molybdenum or molybdenum alloys in fuel processing
systems.

4.5.8.1 Subtask 3.2.4.1 Development of molybdenum having improved
resistance to contamination-induced embrittlement and/or

cracking

 

Welded molybdenum joints are generally brittle and somewhat fragile at
temperatures up to 200 to 400°C. This has been attributed to the presence
of carbides, oxides and nitrides, even at very low concentrations. 7-21
Oxygen has been found to be particularly harmful in causing weld cracking
because it apparently forms low-melting films with molybdenum that lead to
grain boundary separation. Recent advances in melting technology have
allowed the production of very-high-purity base material. However, impu-
rities are generally introduced during welding and studies will be under-
taken to evaluate the effect of alloying elements on reducing the tendency
for hot cracking and for increasing the room temperature ductility of the
weldments. There is evidencel” that the rare-earth elements and boron may
have beneficial effects, and molybdenum alloys containing these elements
will be evaluated initially. Standard weld-cracking tests (e.g., spot
Varestraint) will be used to evaluate weldability. Ductility and toughness
will be measured as a function of strain rate and temperature.

4.5.8.2 Subtask 3.2.4.2 Effect of joining processes and variables on
welding and mechanical properties

In order to assist in the design and construction of molybdenum components
for a processing system, it is necessary that studies be carried out to

determine how various joining processes (e.g., gas tungsten-arc and electron-
beam welding) and the procedural variables in a given joining process affect

the weldability of a particular molybdenum base metal. Work of this type
is quite important prior to system design so that components can be built
utilizing the optimum welding process, joint geometry, etc. Additionally,
the mechanical properties (particularly toughness and ductility) of any
candidate materials will be determined, especially in the welded condi-
tion. This effort will be similar to that carried out previously on com-
merical arc-cast tubing,’ but it would alse include other welding processes
and procedural variables for a given process as well as for other base-
metal forms such as sheet.

4.5.8.3 Subtask 3.2.4.3 Braze-alloy development studies
Although an iron-base alloy of the composition Fe-Mo-Ge-C=B (75-15-5-4-1

wt 7%) was previously developed which has good brazing characteristics and
adequate resistance to bismuth corrosion at 650°C, further development is

 

 
4-33

needed in this area. This alloy has several undesirable characteristics
which make its use difficult, such as a tendency to crack on cooling
after brazing and a brazing temperature that is above the recrystalliza-
tion temperature of molybdenum. Studies will initially emphasize modifi-
cation of this alloy to improve these characteristics. However, a more
nearly corrosion-resistant alloy would be desirable and later studies
will emphasize development of an entirely new braze material. Braze
alloys will be evaluated to determine their wettability, flowability,
mechanical properties and corrosion resistance to salt mixtures and
Bi~Li solutions.

4.5.8.4 Subtask 3.2.4.4 Mechanical joint development

The development of mechanical joints could be an important factor in
constructing complex systems with molybdenum. Previous work’ has shown
that resealable mechanical couplings can be made. The objective of this
subtask will be to extend the previous developmental work to joint sizes
that would be required in experimental and actual process equipment.
These studies would also seek to improve reliability and leak tightness
of couplings. Joint design and seals are two important factors that
will be considered.

4.5.9 Task 3.2.5 Joining of tantalum alloys

 

The object of this subtask is to provide joining information on specific
tantalum alloys selected for engineering experiments on fuel processing.

4.5.9.1 Subtask 3.2.5.1 Effect of joining processes and variables
on welding and mechanical properties

 

Tantalum and tantalum alloys are not generally considered to be difficult
to weld. Once a particular tantalum alloy is selected for a fuel processing
application, it would be the purpose of this subtask to review joining
process methods and determine optimum process parameters for the appli-
cation. The basic welding method tc be used would be gas tungsten-arc
and the variables to be optimized would be heat input, travel speed,
welding current and the method of filler-metal addition. In addition,
the effect of surface preparation and pre- and post-weld heat treatments
will be determined. Evaluation of weld joints will consist of penetrant
examination, helium leak tests before and after thermal cycles, Vare-
straint tests and ductility and toughness measurements as a function of
strain rate and temperature.

4.5.9.2 Subtask 3.2.5.2 Brazing development studies

 

If brazed joints are to be utilized with tantalum-base materials in
processing systems, a braze alloy must be developed. The principal
or =

4-34

requirements for such an alloy would be corrosion resistance and mechan-
ical strength and ductility. Brazing temperature would not be as crit-
ical as with molybdenum because tantalum alloys do not suffer such a
sharp drop in ductility upon recrystallization. Initially, the wettabil-
ity and flowability characteristics of several alloys will be evaluated
visually and metallographically. After these screening tests, brazed
samples will be exposed to molten-salt mixtures and Bi-Li solutions in
isothermal capsule tests. The mechanical strength and ductility of the
most promising alloys will then be determined as a function of tempera-
ture. Finally, samples will be exposed to molten-salt mixtures and Bi-Li
solutions in flow systems that simulate actual processing conditions.

4.5.10 Task 3.2.6 Joining of graphite

 

One of the requirements for the use of graphite in fuel processing appli-
cations is the development of joining techniques. Several types of joints
involving graphite are anticipated such as graphite~to-graphite and
graphite-to-refractory metal.

4.5.10.1 Subtask 3.2.6.1 Brazing development studies

 

4 prime difficulty in brazing graphite to graphite and to metals is the
differences in coefficient of thermal expansion between the graphite,

the brazing alloys, and the metals. In addition, one must alsc consider
the extreme difficulty in obtaining adequate wetting and flow. Other
requirements are adequate strength, suitable ductility, and good corrosion
resistance.

A limited number of brazing alloys have been developed at ORNL which con-
tain a sufficient amount of carbide-forming elements to adequately braze
graphite to itself and to metal. Graded-transition joints have also been
developed at ORNL and these appear to be suitable for overcoming large
mismatches in expansion.?2? However, none of the brazing alloys or tran-
gition joints have been corrosion tested in bismuth-lithium sclutioms or
molten~salt mixtures, and a development and testing program will be
required.

Initially, the program will consist of compatibility testing of the exist-
ing graphite-brazing alloys, and, based on these results, further alloys
may be developed. The subsequent brazing-alloy development work will
utilize the best-known corrosion-resistant materials, and alloys will be
formulated that melt and flow in the proper temperature range and which
wet and flow on graphite. These alloys will then be tested for compati-
bility with the appropriate environments (see Section 4.4.8, Task 3.1.4).

4.5.10.2 Subtask 3.2.6.2 Organic-cemented joint development

Various cements (such as those containing furfural alcohol), joint designs,
and curing techniques have been developed for HIGR applications. The pur-
pose of that work was to obtain cemented carbonaceous joints of the lowest-
possible permeability. In the HIGR study it was found that joint thickness
must be kept at a minimum, preferably at about 0.020-in. Uniform joint
clearances are necessary, and a load of about 200 psi must be applied to
the pieces being joined while the cement cures. Strict control over cement
preparation must be maintained, and the rate of heating during carbonizing
must be carefully controlled.

No evaluations of this type of joint have been performed for chemical
processing applications, and a compatibility and mechanical property test
program involving sample joints will be conducted. It will consist ini-
tially of a review of commercial practices and the construction and eval-
uation of prototype joints. The evaluation will consist of metallographic
examination, leak testing, corrosion testing and determination of high-
temperature mechanical properties.

4.5.10.3 Subtask 3.2.6.3 High-temperature diffusion-bonding studies

Solid-state joints of the diffusion-bonding type have been made, but

there is considerable difficulty in making engineering components using
this method. Most diffusion bonding applications utilize some deforma-
tion or plastic flow of the base materials during bonding. Two of the
most important considerations are joint design and selection of a carbide-
forming filler metal. A development and evaluation program will be re-
quired before suitable procedures can be formulated. Leak tightness,
mechanical strength, and corrosion resistance will be determined as a
function of time, temperature, pressure, and surface finish with various
intermediate filler metals such as tantalum, niobium, and titanium.

4.,5.10.4 Subtask 3.2.6.4 Mechanical joint studies

 

The development of high-reliability, leak-tight mechanical joints for
attaching graphite to graphite and to metals would be extremely bene-
ficial, and only limited information in this area is available.

An attractive alternate approach is that of combining a mechanical joint
with brazing. The mechanical joint would provide additional strength
while the braze material would provide leak-tightness. Development work
will be carried out to investigate these possibilities. The work will
consist of evaluating existing joint designs for fuel processing engineer-
ing systems. Leak tightness will be measured as a function of temperature
and thermal cycles. Based on these tests, second generation designs will
be developed and evaluated. Key requirements for these joints will be
reliability (leak-tightness), mechanical strength, and low cost.

4.6 TASK GROUP 3.3 CONSTRUCTION OF ENGINEERING FUEL PROCESSING
EXPERIMENTS

4.6.1 Objective

The objective of this task is to provide information on materials relative
to the design and construction of engineering fuel processing experiments.
In addition, a surveillance program will be carried cut to evaluate the
effect of fuel processing conditions on materials properties.

4.6.2 Schedule

The schedule for work in this task group is shown in Table 4.6.2,

4.6.3 Funding

Operating fund requirements for this task group are shown in Table 4.6.3.

4.6.4 Facilities
Facilities as specified in subsection 4.5.4, will be used in the develop-

ment of materials fabrication and joining processes which will be appli-
cable to work in this task group.

4.6.5 Task 3.3.1 Continuous Fluorinator Experimental Facility

 

The objective of this work is to provide and evaluate surveillance speci-
mens for a facility in which continuous frozen-wall fluorinators will be
tested, and to evaluate the extent to which a frozen-salt layer protects
the fluorinator material of construction (L-nickel) by allowing passiva-
tion of the nickel to occur. A description of the facility is given in
Task 2.2.6 (see Section 3).

4.6.5.1 Subtask 3.3.1.1 Evaluation of surveillance specimens

 

A series of surveillance specimens will be exposed in the Continuous
Fluorinator Experimental Facility to evaluate the effect of fluorine-
molten salt and hydrogen-molten salt environments on corrosion rate.
Variables will include flow rates, temperature, and concentration of
UF, in the salt feed. One of the principal objectives of work in this
facility is to demonstrate frozen-wall corrosion protection in con-
tinuous fluorinators. Therefore, the changes in wall thickness of the
fluorinator material (nickel) will be monitored using non-destructive
techniques such as eddy-current measurements. A comparison of results
for the surveillance specimens with those for the fluorinator wall
material will indicate the extent to which corrosion protection is
provided by the frozen-salt layer which should allow passivation of
the nickel to occur.

5. CHEMICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

5.1 INTRODUCTION

5.1.1 Objective

The objective of this activity is to obtain the chemical information
necessary for the design of molten-salt breeder reactors. Work in

this activity will include studies of fuel and coolant salt chemistry,
measurements of required physical properties, studies relating to

tritium management, delineation of operating parameters, and chemical
studies related to off-design events such as temperature excursions or
leaks. This activity will also provide chemical support during engineer-
ing development activities.

5.1.2 Scope

These laboratory-scale studies will involve detailed investigations of
chemistry in MSBR fuel salt including measurement of solubility products
for the actinide oxides, studies of the behavior of tellurium under
various redox conditions, phase behavior of PuFj3, fuel-coolant inter-
actions, and determination of physical property data. Similarly, under-
standing of the chemistry of the coolant salt NaBFy-NaF (92-8 mole %)
must be greatly enhanced. Oxide and hydroxide chemistry in fluoroborate
will receive intensive study along with investigations of the corrosion
chemistry of this salt, methods for purifying the salt, and measurements
of physical properties. An assessment of alternate coolants will also
be made. Tritium behavior in MSBR systems will also require major study.
In addition to measurements of the permeability of various alloys to
tritium, the possibility of sustaining an impermeable oxide film on the
steam side of the steam generator will be fully explored. Measurements
of the solubilities, diffusivities, etc. of T, and HT in fuel and coolant
salts will be made to aid in predicting tritium behavior in an MSBR
system. Studies of fission product chemistry will be focused chiefly

on the chemistry of niobium, molybdenum, other noble metals, and iodine.
The objective of these studies is the accurate prediction of fission
product distribution in an MSBR system. Fundamental studies of LiF-BeF,-
ThF, mixtures will include determination of activity coefficients of
both major and minor components of these systems. Porous electrodes
will be used to study the chemistry of trace elements such as bismuth

in MSBR fuel salt.

Work related to the chemistry of MSBR fuel processing is covered in
Section 3 Fuel Processing.

5.2 PROGRAM BUDGET AND SCHEDULE
5.2.1 Schedule and key program milestones
The schedule for work on chemical research and development is shown in

Table 5.2.1.1. The key program milestones for this activity are listed
in Table 5.2.1.2 and occur at the times indicated in Table 5.2.1.1.

5.2.2 Budget summary

A summary of the operating budget is given in Table 5.2.2.1. Table
5.2.2.2 shows requirements for capital equipment funds.

5.3 REQUIREMENTS, BACKGROUND AND STATUS OF DEVELOPMENT
5.3.1 Requirements
5.3.1.1 Basis for fuel salt composition

The fuel salt for a single-fluid MSBR must satisfy a number of stringent
requirements. ! It must

(1) have a low capture cross-section for neutrons,

(2) dissolve more than a critical concentration of uranium or plutonium
as well as high concentrations of thorium,

(3) be thermally stable,

(4) have a low vapor pressure at 600-750°C,

(5) possess good heat-transfer and hydrodynamic properties,
(6) be nonaggressive toward materials of construction,

(7) be stable to reactor radiation,

(8) tolerate fission product accumulation, and

(9) be amenable to recovery of bred fissile material and removal of
fission products.

 

 
 

 

5-3

Very few materials can meet these requirements. Fluoride salts of
71ithium and beryllium are among the few candidates for the molten
salt. Various compositions of UF, and ThF, dissolved in mixtures of
LiF and BeF, have been considered for the fuel salt. The most likely
choice — and the present design composition — is LiF-BeF,~ThF,-UF,
(71.7-16-12-0.3 mole 7). The fuel salt composition has been thoroughly
evaluated in the past and alternate fuel salts, with the exception of
minor adjustments in composition or the possible substitution of PuFj
for UF, in converter reactors or for MSBR startup, are not presently
under consideration.

5.3.1.2 Basis for coolant salt composition

 

The coolant salt, used to transfer heat from the fuel salt to the steam—
raising system, should meet a number of requirements and constraints?
which include the following:

(1) The consequences of an accidental mixing of coolant and fuel must
be minimal and reversible. Primary heat exchangers cannot be
guaranteed to be leak-free for the life of an MSBR plant; therefore,
there is a finite probability that mixing of fuel salt and coolant
will occur. The consequences of such mixing should not lead to
dire consequences (such as nuclear excursions, chemical explosions,

- rapid corrosion, or failure of major plant components) and must be
reversible. It is desirable that the expensive fuel salt not be
rendered useless.

(2) It would be highly beneficial and desirable if virtually all
of the tritium diffusing into the coolant circuit was sequestered.
This would aid in reducing the rate at which tritium transfers
to the steam system and minimize the amount released to the envi-
ronment. Because the fuel salt contains a high atomic density of
lithium, a significant quantity of tritium [2420 curies per day in
a 1000-MW(e) MSBR] is generated in the reactor core.® Structural
metals being considered for MSRs are permeable to tritium, and it
is likely that a significant fraction of the tritium will diffuse
into the coolant circuit.

(3) The coolant must be compatible with components which it contacts
normally. Only minimal corrosion of heat exchangers, pumps, steam
generators, reheaters, storage tanks, etc., can be tolerated in
normal operation or as a result of foreseeable leaks or operating
excursions.

(4) Small leaks in the steamraising system must be tolerable, and not
result in serious consequences. Steam leakage into the coolant
should not result in violent reactions with the coolant nor render
the coolant seriously corrosive. A practical means for reprocessing
the coolant to remove water or its reaction products should be
available. Coolant leaks into the steam system should not lead
to serious corrosion such as stress—corrosion cracking.

(5) Radiation within the primary heat exchanger should have minimal
detrimental effects upon the vapor pressure, composition and
compatibility of the coolant.

(6) The coolant should have acceptable heat-transfer and fluid proper-
ties. Film coefficients should be high; viscosity and density
should be low.

(7) The coolant should have a freezing point below 600°F. Any freezing
point below 600°F (316°C) would permit feedwater temperatures
(550-580°F) used in conventional supercritical steam cycles.

Higher cecolant freezing points, perhaps as high as 775°F, can be
tolerated if the feedwater is preheated with steam diverted from
the steam generators.

(8) The coolant should exhibit a low vapor pressure at normal operating
temperatures. If a significant vapor pressure (>0.01 atm) must be
tolerated, the vapor should have a low condensation temperature.

(9) The coolant should be inexpensive and available in high purity.
Elements rare in the earth's crust should not be considered for a
future multireactor MSBR system.

Only a few materials meet these requirements and constraints. The present
design composition is a mixture of 92 mole % NaBF, (sodium fluoroborate)
and 8 mole % NaF. The fluoroborate coolant does not completely satisfy
all of the above criteria, although its shortcomings can be accommodated
by design adjustments. Alternate coolants are alsc being considered
(Sect. 5.5.8, Task 4.2.4). Since some uncertainty exists as to the
ultimate choice of coolant, the coolant salt research and development
activities are not as firmly defined as those for the fuel salt.

5.3.2 Background

5.3.2.1 Experience with molten salt fuels

Molten salt systems for high-temperature nuclear reactors have been under

development since 1947 and extensive experience with fluoride-based salts
has been accumulated.” First developed were NaF~ZrF,~UF, mixtures, which
fueled the Aircraft Reactor Experiment in 1954. As breeder reactor
development received increasing emphasis, a fuel composed of 7LiF-BeF,~
ZrF,-UF, was developed and used in the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment
(MSRE) which operated for a total of 2-1/2 years beginning in 1966 until
the scheduled shut down. Extensive experience with fluoride-based molten
salts was accumulated during this period.® Thus, the present fuel salt
selected for MSBRs is based on a long, well-established background of
experience and appears most likely to meet the requirements of MSBRs

with a minimum of additional research and development.
5-8

5.3.2.2 Experience with coolant salt

Previous work with coolant salts has been much more limited than that
with fuel salts. The MSRE was designed as an evaluation of the fuel,
reactor vessel, and reactor operating characteristics. The coolant for
the MSRE, a LiP-BeF,; mixture, was used to reject heat to an air radiator.
Its melting point of 851°F is higher than acceptable for use in a com-
ventional steam-raising system.

The use of sodium fluoroborate as a coolant was first suggested in 1966
and experience has been accumulated since then. Investigations of the
phase behavior of the binary system identified the eutectic mixture as
NaBFy-NaF (92-8 mole 7) with a melting point of 384°C; this mixture was
tentatively selected as the reference coolant for an MSBR. Considerable
additional research is needed, however, to assure that this will be a
satisfactory coolant. In particular, the ability of NaBF, to trap
tritium by exchange with OH™ species in the melt remains undemonstrated
and alternate MSBR designs may be considered.’ The NaBFy-NaF mixture

is more corrosive toward Hastelloy N than is the fuel salt and additional
knowledge of corrosion reactions is needed. Interactions with fuel salt
and with steam, which could result from leaks, need to be more fully
considered, and additional measurements of physical properties are needed.

Although fluoroborate can possibly be used as the coolant salt for
MSBRs, there is incentive to consider alternate coolant materials. An
evaluation of alternate coolants will receive an early priority in addi-
tion to research and development on fluoroborate. Resolution of the
coolant salt selection must be made early in order that reactor design
and engineering development can proceed smoothly.

5.3.3 Status of development

 

5.3.3.1 Fuel salt chemistry

Phase equilibria among the pertinent MSBR fluorides largely have been
studied in detail, and the equilibrium diagrams are relatively well
understood. Diagrams for binary systems such as LiF-Be¥F,, LiF-UF,, and
LiF~ThF;, have been developed;®s gimilarly, those for ternary systems
such as LiF-BeF,;~-ThF, and LiF-BeF,-UF, have been established, 8510

The requirement that oxide ion either be absent or be present only in very
low concentrations in the molten fluoride fuel was recognized in the

early stages of development of molten-salt reactors.1l In the MSRE,

ZrF, served as an oxide ‘getter’, thus preventing the possible formation
and precipitation of the sparingly scluble U0,.1 The experience gained
with the operation of the MSRE indicated that no increase in oxide con-
centration had occurred during the lifetime of the reactor, and demon-
strated the feasibility of performing the necessary reactor operations

and maintenance without significant atmospheric contamination. Since

the MSBR fuel solvent will not contain ZrFy, more stringent restrictions

 

 
5-9

on the presence of oxide are required. If accidental contamination of
MSBR fuel with significant amounts of air or water should occur, then
not only could U0, precipitate but also ThO,, PaO, Pu0, and NpG,. It
has been established that the actinide dioxides all have the same fluorite
type structure; consequently, the presence of two or more actinides is
conducive to the formation of insoluble oxide solid solutions,i3716

The data obtained indicated that the distribution of heavier actinides
between the liquid and solid phases strongly favors the latter. A
correlation was found between the measured distribution quotients and
the lattice parameters of the pure actinide oxides which allowed predic~
tion of the precipitation behavior of neptunium!® and the distribution
of actinides between the melt and binary and ternary solid solutions.l?

The important effect of the redox potential of the fuel on the corrosion
of structural materials in a molten-salt reactor has also been recog-
nized.1® From an overall standpoint, the fission process is slightly
oxidizing; this effect was mitigated in the MSRE by using a redex buffer
established by maintaining a small fraction of the uranium present as
UF3. The UF3/UF, ratio thus established the redox potential of the fuel
salt. All of the actinides present in significant quantities im an MSBR,
with the exception of thorium, exhibit a multivalent character; thus,
the redox potential of the fuel will determine the oxidation state of
these elements and, consequently, the valence of the actinides in a
precipitated oxide phase. It has been determined that the solubility
behavior of the protactinium oxides Pay05 and Pal, is quite different.
The former appears as a single phase and has a much lower sclubility
than Pa0,, which appears in binary or tertiary solid solutions .!9s20
Similarly, it has been demonstrated that plutonium will precipitate only
as a dioxide in solid solution while trivalent plutonium does not appear
to precipitate at all as an oxide from the fuel salt,1®

From the standpoint of reactor safety, it is very important to evaluate
accurately the solubility behavior of the various actinide oxides and
their interactions as a function of temperature and as a function of
redox potential. Some actinide oxide—fluoride systems have been well
characterized with regard to their dependence on temperature and redox
potential while others are less well defined; thus, the research required
on this subject (discussed in detail later) has various degrees of
priority.

After shutdown of the MSRE, it was found that some intergranular attack
had occurred in Hastelloy N samples and reactor components, 21 Although
the attack was not catastrophic, it appeared to be significant when the
specimens were subjected to stress. Analyses of the specimens indicated
the presence of fission products, especially tellurium, Preliminary
scanning tests made in the laboratory with several of these elements
suggested strongly that tellurium was responsible for the intergranular
attack.?! Little is known about the behavior of tellurium in an MSR
environment, especially about the effect of the redox potential of the
fuel on the relative concentrations of the various tellurium species
5-10

0
Tes, TeZ™, etc., which may be present.2? It is necessary to study this
effect in order to develop methods for dealing with the presence of
tellurium.

Plutonium (as PuF3) has heen proposed as a component of the start-up fuel
for MSBRs?® or as the make-up fuel in molten-salt converter reactors; it
has already been used as fissionable make-up fuel, replacing the consumed
233y in the MSRE.S In order to start up a molten—-salt reactor with plu-
tonium and run it successfully, the behavior of this element under normal
operating conditions and in the presence of impurities such as 02” has to
be known. The solubility of PuF3 in molten fluorides must be adequate

to satisfy the requirements of converter or breeder reactors. Some solu-
bility measurements in LiF-BeF,-Th¥F, solutions were made at ORNL2" and

at Bhabba Atomic Research Centre, India.?® Although there is a discrep-
ancy between the values obtained by the laboratories, the results
obtained indicate that even the lower measured solubilities (India) amply
satisfy the requirements for an MSBR. Nevertheless, it is necessary to
determine the cause of the difference in the values. The effect of oxide
on the solubility of PuFj; under different redox conditions has been
studied to some extent at ORNL,1%>2"% but more research will be required
in order to completely define the system and to obtain useful thermo-
chemical data for the various plutonium species.

One of the safety aspects of the MSBR that requires scrutiny is the be-
havior of actinides in the event of accidental mixing of fuel salt and
the reference coolant, NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole %). It is known from prelim-
inary experiments2® that both phases exhibit partial miscibility under
some, although not well defined, conditions. The BF3 gas pressures thus
generated under static or dynamic mixing conditions are not well known
for the former condition, and are unknown for dynamic mixing. Although
it may be speculated that, in the event of mizing, the actinides may
separate as the triple fluoride salt 7NaF-6(Th,U)F, identified to have
formed in a large loop, 2’ the conditions under which separation can occur
(such as ratio of volumes of fuel to coolant salt, velocity of mixing,
and temperature) have not been defined.

Although physical properties of fluoride mixtures are, in general

quite well known , 2 329 those of the MSBR fuel salt in particular will
require more precise measurements, especially its thermal conductivity.

The vapor pressure, the predominant species in the vapor phase above the
residual fuel salt after vaporization of a specified fraction of the

initial liquid, and the latent heat of vaporization of the corresponding
liquid will have to be determined since ne direct measurements are currently
available; the present estimates were obtained by extrapolation from
measurements with the systems LiF-BeF,; and LiF-UFy.

A UF3/UF, ratio will have to be selected for the MSBR which satisfies or
reaches a compromise among the numerous equilibria occurring simultane-~
ously in the reactor; e.g. the depletion of chromium from the surface of
the Hastelloy N, the oxidation-reduction of tellurium species and of
protactinium 4+ and 5+ species, the reaction of UF3 with graphite leading

 

 

isi

E
3-11

to the formation of uranium carbides, etc. The latter equilibrium has
been studied, 3? and the results indicated that fuel salt with a UF,/UF;
ratio larger than 10 is stable at 550°C with respect to the formation

of the uranium carbide UC,. In the event of atmospheric contamination,
not only does the UF3/UF, ratio decrease but the concentration of 02-
increases. Evidence has been found recently which suggests that the
presence of oxide may lead to the formation of solid uranium oxycarbides,
more stable than the binary carbide.3Y Since no other data on the
subject are available, this aspect of the effect of oxide and redox
potential will be examined further,

5.3.3.2 Coolant salt chemistry

In an MSBR it is not possible to couple the circulating fuel directly to
the steam—generating system. Two reasons may be cited: first, the melt-
ing point of the fuel salt is considerably higher than the feedwater
temperatures desired for the steam system; second, leaks would have
undesirable economic and potentially hazardous consequences; e.g., steam
leaking into the fuel salt would precipitate uranium, thorium, and
beryllium as oxides and fuel leaking into the steam system would contami-
nate the latter with fission products, tritium, and other radioactive
substances (Pa, U, Th). Thus, an MSBR requires ag coolant system to act
as a protective barrier between the fuel circuit and the steam-generating
system and to transport the heat to the steam-raising system without
freezing either fuel salt or coolant.

Coolants being considered for other advanced reactors are less desirable
as coolants for molten-salt reactors. Sodium (as well as other alkali
metals) reacts vigorously with fuel salt and with steam. High-pressure
helium would require that the primary heat-exchanger system be very
large, thereby increasing the fuel inventory and the doubling time of
the reactor.

In the MSRE, the coolant was 7LiF - BeF, (66-34 mole %Z). This coolant
discharged its heat at 546°C (1015°F) to an air-cooled radiator which
was maintained above the coolant's freezing point, 459°C. The MSRE
coolant composition is not suitable for use in an MSBR since the freezing
point is too high for transmitting heat to a system in which the feedwater
is supplied at or below 371°C (700°F). In addition, there would be a
practical necessity for using isotopically pure (and expensive) lithium-7
in the coolant salt, If lithium in natural isotopic abundance were used,
leakage of coolant into the fuel circuit would require expensive pro-
cedures for removing lithium-6 or acceptance of decreased breeding
performance and increased tritium production.

There are twc important requirements for an MSBR coolant. One, which is
unique and stringent, is that the effects of leakage in the primary heat
exchanger must be minimal and reversible. It is also highly desirable
that all the tritium that diffuses into the coolant circuit be sequestered
in this circuit. The first requirement dictates that chemical reactions
between the fuel salt and the coolant must not lead to precipitation
5-12

of uranium (and other elements) from the fuel; neither should violent
{(i.e., strongly exothermic) reactions occur upon mixing of the fuel salt
and coolant. In meeting the second requirement, about 800 curies of
tritium per day3! would have to undergo oxidation, isotope-exchange or
some other interaction which interdicts the flow of tritium into the
steam system,

A molten mixture of NaBF, and NaF provisionally appears to meet the
necessary heat-transfer requirements for an MSBR coolant. It is rela-
tively inexpensive and, at normal operating temperatures (454 - 621°C),
exhibits acceptable thermal capacity, 28 thermal conductivity, 32 and
favorable viscosity and density.2? The vapor pressure of BF,, due to
thermal decomposition of this coclant, was found to be less than 1 atm
at the highest operating temperature for compositions containing less
than 93 mole % NaBFy. Accurate studies of phase behavior?® showed that
the composition NaBF;-NaF (92-8 mole %) had the lowest-melting point,
384°C, in the system.

Fluoroborate coolant contains protonic and oxide impurities which persist
at some low level despite attempts to eliminate them by chemical purifi-
cation. Oxide solubility is high in fluorcborate, indicating that strong
boron—-oxygen bonds exist, and these effectively resist chemical means of
replacing the oxygen with fluorine. The protonic impurities are partly
bound3? in the anion, BF3;0H . However, attempts to exchange deuterium
with the hydrogen in this anion have thus far been unsuccessful, 33
Oxidizing ions (Ni2¥, Fe2T, cx3ty, soluble in low concentration, 3%s35

may possibly be used in schemes for sequestering the tritium within the
coolant circuit.

The corrosivity of fluoroborate to Hastelloy N under normal reactor
operating conditions seems to be acceptably low, although delayed
neutron interaction with a small amount of boron, chemically reduced
from the coolant, could conceivably cause embrittlement of heat-exchanger
tubes if the diffusivity of the resulting borides in Hastelloy N is suf-
ficiently high. Steam greatly increases the corrosivity of fluorcborate;
much additional study of the corrosive effects of steam is necessary be-
fore the consequences of steam leakage into this coolant can be reliably
predicted.

The consequences of mixing fuel salt and fluorcborate have not been
extensively examined. Measurements of BF; solubility 3® suggest that
even gross mixing of coolant with fuel salt will not cause dangerously
high BF3; pressures provided equilibrium is reached; a real mixing situa-
tion can conceivably result in more detrimental consequences. Leakage
of fuel salt into coolant could pose important safety questions about
the precipitation of constituents from the fuel.

A study is underway to assess the attributes of other materials relative
to fluoroborate as a coolant. Until these other potential coolants are
adequately examined, it is prudent to continue investigating the relevant
chemistry of fluorcborate since NaBF,-NaF may yet be the best overall
choice for am MSBR coolant.

5.3.3.3 Tritium behavior

About 0.25 g of tritium is generated per day in a 1000-MW(e) molten-
salt reactor.3? Since metals at high temperatures are permeable to

the isotopes of hydrogen, the pathways for tritium flow from the reactor
to the environment are numerous. Although many of the pathways do not
present serious difficulty, the flow to the steam generator results in
tritium contamination of the steam system and release of tritium to the
environment via blowdown and leakage to the condenser coolant.

Calculations indicate that, in the reference MSBR, about 790 Ci/day of
tritium might reach the steam system. 3’ Virtually all of this would
be released by normal system blowdown into the condenser cooling water.
Discharge of 790 Ci/day in a 560,000 gal/min stream! produces a con-
centration of 260 x 1073 uCi/liter. This is 52 times the 5 x 1073
uCi/liter concentration used as a design objective for liquid effluents
for light-water-cooled nuclear power reactors.3® Molten-salt reactors
may possibly be required to attain similarly low concentrations, so the
unhindered discharge of tritium in liquid effluents from the reference~
design MSBR appears to be unacceptable.’

In addition to the loss of tritium to the environment, contamination
of the steam system could reach levels of 4-9 mCi/cc in the 300,000-gal
inventory of water in a typical plant .37 This concentration is about
the same as in the moderator of a large heavy water reactor,3® and ex-
tensive safety precautions would be required to permit maintenance of
the MSBR steam system.

Tritium transport to the steam system might be prevented if a combina-
tion of techniques can be used to contain and to process the tritium

in a MSBR. Containment might be achieved if, for example, an oxide
corrosion film formed by steam on steam generator tubing serves to
impede tritium permeation. Some varieties of corrosion films on
candidate steam generator materials have been found to offer significant
impedance to permeation, #0 The extension of this work to the conditions
expected in a steam generator will require experimental development.

Both the chemical form and the transport properties of tritium are
significant for consideration of tritium management in MSBR systems.
Solubilities and diffusivities of tritium-containing species in fuel

and coolant are needed for the development of adequate representations
of tritium behavior in MSBRs and for evaluation of potential methods for
tritium processing. Some measurements of hydrogen and deuterium solu~
bilities in fluoride salts have been made.®! The reaction of hydrogen
with uranium (IV) fluoride to produce UF3 and hydrogen fluoride has

been studied, *? as has the adsorption of hydrogen on graphite, 3 The
chemical reactions of hydrogen with candidate coolants have also received
attention. It is possible that a chemical processing method for removal
of tritium from the coolant may be developed. Such development would
require additional research and would not obviate the need for an in-
creased resistance to tritium permeation which may be afforded by a
corrosion film in the steam generator,
5-14

5.3.3.4 Fission product chemistry

 

Because of the effect of fission products on reactor operation and per-
formance with regard to breeding, materials behavior, afterheat and
maintenance, much attention has been given to understanding their fate
in the MSRE and more will necessarily be required in future MSBR de-
velopment. The fission products fall into several groups according to
their chemical behavior in molten fluorides. These groups, in order of
importance as neutron poisons, are: the noble gases, the stable salt-
seeking rare-earth fluorides, the noble metals, and the other stable
salt-seeking fluorides. Table 5.3.3.4 shows the distribution of fission
products found in the MSRE.

The noble gases have very low solubilities in the fuel salt®1,42-%6 znd,
consequently, can be removed by sparging with helium. This was effec-
tively demonstrated in the MSRE where over 80% of the 135%e was removed.’
More efficient methods of sparging have been proposed for the MSBR and,
consequently, noble gas poisoning is expected to be held at a minimum.
Since most of the 13°Xe is produced indirectly by decay of the 6.7-hr
half-life 1351, the usage of sidestream iodine strippers has been
suggested’® as a method of minimizing poisoning in an MSBR. This would
involve the reaction: HF(g) + I~ - F + HI(g), where HF{g) is added in
small amounts to the normal helium sparge. If the other methods for
holding the 135xe poison fraction"® at acceptable levels do not prove
successful, it has been proposed that the iodine stripping system might
be used in conjunction with the Xe removal process.

The rare earths and other stable soluble fluorides (e.g., Zr, Ce, Nd,
Sr, Cs, Y, Ba, Rb) are all expected to be found principally in the

fuel salt and can be removed by processing schemes currently under
development {see Section 3). The chemical behavior of the above fission
products is fairly well understood and, like the noble gas behavior, can
be anticipated in operating molten-salt reactors.

The chemical behavior of the so-called noble-metal fission products

(Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Ag, Sb, and Te) is considerably less predictable — as
has been borne out in MSRE operations - and warrants further study.
These fission products appear throughout the fuel system: in the salt,
metal, graphite and, possibly, the cover gas (Table 1). Based on avail-
able thermodynamic data, they are expected to appear in a reduced form
at UF,/UFy ratios less than 102. However, in the reduced and presumed
metallic state, these fission products can disperse via many mechanisms.

MSRE operation analyses of five noble-metal nuclides, 9%Mo, 103Ru,
106Ry, 129-1327, found in salt samples ranged from fractions to tens
of percent of inventory. Based on thermodynamic considerations and a
correlation of their behavior with that of !llAg for which no stable
fluoride exists under fuel salt conditions, it has tentatively been
concluded that they are also metallic species which occur as finely
divided particles suspended in the salt.

.The noble-metal fission products were alsc found deposited on graphite

and Hastelloy N specimens (i.e., surveillance as well as post-operation

specimens). However, their distribution on both sets of specimens =
varied widely and allowed for only very tenuous conclusions to be drawn.
It was evident from these studies that net deposition was generally
more intense on the metal than on graphite, and for the metal was more
intense under turbulent flow.

Gas samples taken from the pump bowl during 23°U operation of the MSRE
indicated that substantial concentrations of noble metals were present
in the gas phase, but improved sampling techniques incorporated during
the 233y operation of the MSRE failed to corroborate these observations.
Present interpretations of these conflicting data suggest that the a
earlier 235U-operation samples were contaminated by salt mist, and that

only a small fraction of the noble metal fission products escape to the

COVETr gas.

Niobium is the most susceptible of the noble metals to oxidation and

was found appreciably in salt samples at the start of the 233y MSRE

operation because of the high initial U*+/U3* ratio. It could be made a
to disappear by lowering the redox potential of the fuel,! but subse-

quently reappeared in the salt several times for not always explainable

reasons. The Nb data did not correlate with the Mo-Ru-Te data mentioned ga
previously nor was there any observable correlation of its behavior

with amounts found in gas samples.?

The actual state of these noble metal fission preducts is of importance

to the effectiveness of MSBR operations. If they exist as metals and

plate the Hastelloy N portions of the reactor, they will be of iittle

consequence as poisons although they can be of importance in determining =
the level of fission product afterheat after reactor shutdown and will

complicate maintenance operations and post-operation decontamination.

(The effect of Te on structural metal integrity is also realized here wi
but is treated in Section 5.4.6}. They can potentially cause difficulty
by carbide formation or by adhering in some other way to the graphite
moderator; however, examination of the MSRE graphite moderator indicated
that the extent of such deposition was limited.

Clearly, most of the future fission product chemical research should

be directed at increasing our understanding of noble-metal fission fi
product behavior to a level comparable to that of the other fission

products. The major objective should be to determine the controlling

mechanisms and associated reaction rates for noble metal interactions wl
with various portions of an MSBR in order that extrapolation to larger
and more complex systems can follow. Among factors of importance to
future reactors are the redox potential of the system (characterized by
the U*H/u3t ratio), the presence of oxide and its affinity for various
fission products, the possible agglomeration of metals onto gas and
bubble interfaces in the absence of colloidal (metallic, graphite,

oxide, etc.) particles, the deposition of noble metals onto colloidal E
particles, and the deposition and resuspension of particles bearing

noble metals. The exploitation of suitable mechanisms to remove noble
5-17

metal fission products or to control their deposition could be an
attractive result of such studies. Finally, future work should take
into account handling of the noble metals or structural components
contaminated by them.

5.3.3.5 Fundamental studies of molten salts

 

A fairly comprehensive knowledge of the formation free energies ach)

of solutes in molten Li,BeF, has been gained over the years from measure-
ments of heterogeneous equilibria involving various gases (e.g., HF or
Hy0) and solids (e.g., metals or oxides).*”~%% The list of dissolved
components for which formation free energies have been estimated in-
cludes LiF, BeF,, ThF,, several rare-earth trifluorides, ZrFy, UF3, UF,
PaF,, PaFs, PuF;, CrF,, FeF,, NiF,, NbF,, NbF;, MoF3, HF, Be0, BeS,
Be(OH)>, and BeI,. Some of these ack values, however, are presently
insufficiently accurate for the needs of the MSBR program (e.g., those
for PaFy, PaF5, ThF,, MoF3, NbF,, NbFs, BeS) and additional equilibrium
measurements involving these solutes are needed. Moreover, there is a
need for the AGL values of certain other fission product compounds such
as the lower fluorides of Tc and Ru, and various dissolved compounds of
Te. A more urgent need is an increased knowledge of how activity coeffi-
cients (which have been defined®0s5! as unity in Li,BeF,) vary as the
melt composition changes. Such knowledge is required to predict how the
numerous chemical equilibrium constants that may be derived from net
values in Li,BeF, will change as the melt composition is changed to that
of an MSBR fuel. It is clear from what is known that the variation of
activity coefficients with melt composition depends primarily on the
mole fraction of LiF and the size and the charge of the cation involved.
Enough additional data reflecting the variation of activity coefficients
with melt composition is needed to make this correlation sufficiently
quantitative to meet the needs of the MSBR program.

Porous or packed-bed electrodes have been demonstrated to have excellent
capability for removal or measurement of species at low concentration

in aqueous media, %,56 Application of suitable impressed electrochemical
potentials to such electrodes results in quantitative deposition of the
species of interest. Preliminary considerations suggest the successful
development of techniques for utilizing similar electrodes in fused salts
of interest to molten-salt breeder reactors. Successful development of
such techniques could lead to amalytical and process applications for
detecting and/or removing various chemical species such as oxide, tel-
lurium, or bismuth at the parts per million level.

5.4 TASK GROUP 4.1 FUEL SALT CHEMISTRY

5.4.1 Objective

Most of the chemical properties of the components of fuel salts have
been established either in the pure state or in mixtures. However,
due to the complex nature of the fuel salt in the reactor environment
5-18

some aspects need further research to determine the variables which will
allow the reactor to operate under optimum conditions. The studies
covered in this task group, with the exception of the determination of
some physical properties, lean heavily toward safety aspects of the
reactor, ranging from normal operating conditions to accidental contami-
nation with the atmosphere and accidental mixing of fuel and coolant.

These objectives are discussed below as tasks and subtasks and are itemized

in the schedule (Section 3.4.2).

5.4.2 Schedule

The schedule for this task group is shown in Table 5.4.2.

5.4.3 Funding

Anticipated funding requirements are shown in Tables 5.4.3.1 and 5.4.3.2
for operating and capital funds, respectively.

5.4.4 Facilities

The research in this task group can be carried cut in existing chemical
laboratories in Building 4500S and the High-Level Alpha Laboratory in
Building 4501. No additional special facilities will be needed.

5.4.5 Task 4.1.1 Solubility products of actinide oxides

The presence of oxide ion in fuel salt above some level has a deleterious
effect because it acts as a precipitating agent for the actinide ioms.
Because several actinides will be simultaneously present in the fuel
salt, it is desirable to have accurate measurements of the solubility
products of the pure oxides over the range of redox potential values of
interest for molten salt reactors. This, in turn, will allow calculation
of the solubility and composition of mixed oxides in solid solution.
Although thorium oxide exhibits the highest solubility among the actinide
dioxides, thorium is by far the most abundant actinide present in the
reactor and, thus, its oxide can lower the activity (by solid solution
formation) of other actinide oxides.

Additional studies are required on the solubilities of oxides of thorium,
protactinium, plutonium and neptunium in fuel salt. It is not believed
that data are required for oxides of higher atomic number than plutonium
since those elements will be present at very low concentrations.

5.4.5.1 Subtask 4.1.1.1 Thorium oxide

The solubility product of ThO; in molten mixtures of LiF-BeF,-ThF, has

oxides, Pa0, and Pay05.1651% Attempts to directly measure the concentra-
tion of oxide ion in ThOj;-saturated melts by chemical analysis yielded
less precise values®’ and EMF measurements using a LaFj electrode®® were
unsuccessful.®? At 550°C the solubility product of ThO, calculated from
the available datal%>19,57 jis respectively 6.9 x 1078, 14.8 x 1078 and
10.7 x 1078, Although these values disagree at most by a factor of 2,
they are presently quite useful for estimating the behavior of Th%" in

the presence of 02” and do not jeopardize reactor safety calculations
because ThO, is the most soluble of the actinide dioxides that could form
in an MSBR. Future research, however, should involve a reexamination of
this parameter, although not as a high priority topic. Unless an oxide-
sensitive electrode is developed for use in molten fluorides, the solu-
bility studies will be performed by equilibration of the oxide-melt system,
and subsequent sampling, grinding etc. in a moisture-free inert atmosphere
glove box. An alternative determination can be performed by means of the
metathesis reaction:

2Ni0(c) + Th* = 2NiZ% + Tho, (c)

in which the filtered samples will be analyzed for dissolved nickel.

5.4.5.2 Subtask 4.1.1.2 Protactinium oxides

 

Protactinium can be precipitated from molten fluorides as Pa,0; or as
binary or ternary solid solutions of Pa0,, depending on the redox
potential of the system and the other actinides present. The sclu-
bility of [ta20s was determined directly in molten fluorides saturated
with Tho, 1°? and from measurements of the equilibrium?’

PaF5(d) + 5/2 Hy0(g) = 1/2 Pa,05(c) + SHF(g)
together with measurements of the equilibrium®?
Hy,0(g) + 2F (d) = 027(d) + 2HF(g) .

Assuming that all the protactinium in the reactor is pentavalent

imposes a minimum limit on the concentration of allowable 02%=., If

the Past concentration in the reactor®! is 1.972 x 10° 6 mole/cm?®, the
oxide concentration allowed at 550°C is, respectively, less than 8.6 x
107% (ref. 19) and 1.23 x 10° (ref. 20). The disagreement in these
values is tolerable at 550°C but increases with increasing temperature
because the temperature effect on the solubility of Pa,05 is more pro-
nounced in the values obtained from ref. 19. Due to this large tempera-
ture effect, it was suggested!® that the precipitate may have been
solvated with LiF. In a long range plan, this discrepancy of the
temperature dependence and identity of the precipitate will have to be
resolved because Pa,05 also participates in other reactions of relevance
to the chemistry of the MSBR, such as

Pa,05(c) + 2UF3(d) + 1/2 UF,(d) = 2PaF,(d) + 5/2 UC, (c or ss) .
5-26

This reaction is important because it indicates the effect of redox
potential on the predominant species of protactinium in the melt. From
a safety point of view, these data can be used to estimate the minimum
ratio of UF3/UF, that should be used to keep the protactinium tetra-
valent, in which case the corresponding oxide exhibits a higher solu-
bility than Pa,0s.

Although measurements have been madel? to determine the effect of redox
potential by means of the equilibrium

Pas 0s (c} + 5/2 ThF; {(d) + H, (g) = 2HF (g) + 2PaF, (4d) + 5/2 ThO» (¢) ’

the data showed considerable uncertainty. The redox potential of the
couple PaFg/PaF, will be determined with higher precision by means of
electroanalytical and spectrophotometric methods or by a transpiration
technique.2? The electroanalytical method will determine the redox
potential by voltammetry in a system where the value of the ratio is
changed by means of sparging with HF-H, mixtures, i.e.

PaF, (d) + HF(g) = PaFs(d) + 1/2 H,(g).

The spectrophotometric method will use the difference in absorptivity
of both protactinium species®? to determine their ratio and the trans-
piration technique will be a repetition of earlier measurements?’ but
with significantly larger amounts of protactinium. Independent experi-
mental work will be performed with appreciable amounts of protactinium,
in the order of several grams, in order to provide unequivocal identi-
fication of the equilibrium solid phases present in the system.

5.4.5.3 Subtask 4.1.1.3 Plutonium oxides

The oxide chemistry of plutonium was studied in several molten fluoride
melts.15:2% Tt was found that the addition of oxide to PuF,-containing
melts did not precipitate any plutonium oxide under mild reducing
conditions, independent of the composition of the melt; i.e., LiF-BeF,
containing ZrFy or ThF, or the pure solvent LiF-BeF,. When Pu; was
added to a LiF-BeF; melt contained in nickel, 311 of the plutonium ended
up as PuF3 in solution. Spectrophotometric measurements in molten
LiF-BeF,-ThF, did not reveal the presence of any plutonium oxyflucride2"
although such a compound has been reported to exist in the solid state.
Bowever, when the oxidation state of the system was increased, e.g., by
the addition of NiF,, it was found that, in the presence of thorium, the
addition of oxide yielded a solid solution of Pu0,-ThO,. 1° The cor-
relation found between distribution quotients and lattice parameters

of pure actinide oxides!® led to the prediction of a large distribution
coefficient for Put (>10"); i.e., it is possible to obtain PuQ,-ThGs
solid solutions with virtually pure PuO,. Because the measured dis-
tribution quotient of plutonium corresponds to Pu*t, the determination
of a large distribution quotient will require a redox potential con-~
siderably more oxidizing than that of the couple Ni2+/NiC used in past
experiments; this in turn will require the use of metals more noble

than nickel for containers.

5.4.5.4 Subtask 4.1.1.4 Neptunium oxides

 

The correlation developed previouslyl!® was used for predicting that
tetravalent neptunium would behave similarly to tetravalent plutonium,
although with a slightly lower distribution quotient. Since no experi-
mental data are available, the behavior of neptunium in oxide-containing
molten fluorides will be studied under various oxidizing conditions.
These studies will be performed simultaneously with determinations of
the redox potential, in molten fluorides in the absence of oxide ion,

of couples formed by the most stable species of neptunium in solution.

5.4.6 Task 4.1.2 Tellurium chemistry

 

Tellurium, present in the MSBR fuel salt as a fission product, is
probably responsible for the intergranular attack observed in Hastelloy
N samples exposed in the MSRE experiment.2?! This was an unexpected
result and, until recently, the chemistry of tellurium in fluoride melts
had not been investigated. The fuel salt is reducing, due to the yt
content, and tellurium would be expected to be present as the dimer,
Te,, and in smaller quantities as the monomer, Te, and/or in a reduced
state. Two lithium tellurides are known®3 (LiTe3 and LiyTe) and the

two telluride ions are interrelated through the following equation:

2Te; = Te?” + 5/2 Te,’.

If the equilibrium constant for this reaction has a value near unity,
the melt could simultaneously contain significant amounts of both ionic
species. The oxidation state is, of course, controlled by the yt ut
ratio in the MSBR fuel salt, as shown in the following equation

2UF, (d) + LiyTe(d) = 2UF3(d) + 2LiF(d) + 1/2 Te, (g)

where the most reduced state of tellurium is the telluride Li,Te. If,

at USt/U%t ratios attainable in an operating MSBR, the equilibrium is
shifted predominately to the left, assuming Li,Te is the stable species,
the tellurium would not be available for reaction with structural metals
such as Ni~ or Cr since it cannot be further reduced. If, however,

Te; is present, this argument may not be valid due to the dispropor-~
tionation reaction yielding Te, . Conversely, if the equilibrium is
shifted predominately to the right, the tellurium would be present as an
elemental gas which is expected to have a very low solubility in fluoride
melts and thus should distribute to the cover gas where it could possibly
be removed in a side-stream purification step. Thus, it can be seen

that information on these two equilibria must be developed to understand
the chemistry of tellurium related to tellurium-induced cracking of
Hastelloy N. The following subtasks have been defined to elucidate

these reactions.
5-28

5.4.6.1 Subtask 4.1.2.1 Solubility of tellurium and tellurides in
molten salts

Before a systematic investigation of the equilibria listed above can

be initiated, it is necessary to determine the solubility of tellurium
gas and of the solid tellurides LiTej and LisTe in fluoride melts.

This will be done first in Li,BeF,, for experimental simplicity, and
then in fuel salt containing thorium fluoride at temperatures ranging
from 500 to 800°C to cover the expected minimum and maximum fuel salt
temperatures of 1000 and 1300°F to be encountered in an operating MSBR.
It has been calculated®” that the solubility eof tellurium in molten
fluorides at 600°C should be approximately 107 !! mole fraction Te, and
about 10713 mole fraction Te. Direct measurements? gave a value of
less than 7.7 x 107° mole fraction at 655°C in Li;BeFy. This apparent
low solubility will necessitate a relatively sophisticated experimental
design to obtain an accurate measurement of the solubility of tellurium.
The use of radiochemical-tracer tellurium may be necessary to obtain
analytical data, which could necessitate glove box isclation of the
apparatus. A Henry's law constant can then be calculated for the
solubility of tellurium gas in Li,BeF, and in fuel salt.

The tellurides LiTes and Li,Te may be more soluble than elemental
tellurium and a different experimental procedure will be required for

the determination of their solubility products. Preliminary results??
suggest an appreciable solubility of LiTez in molten fluorides; LijTe

is known to be scluble te at least 0.05 mole fractiom im LiCl-LiF
mixtures at 525°C.%° Prior to solubility measurements, however, it will
be necessary to synthesize LiTe3. The LizTe can be purchased but most
likely will have to be repurified. Attention will be drawn to the
detection of significant amounts of Te, in the gas phase as a conse-
quence of the dissolution of LiTes. This would indicate the stability

in solution of the Tes . A stirred pot or rocking vessel with a graphite
or boron nitride crucible or liner could be utilized in the temperature
range 500-800°C for these solubility measurements. Samples for analysis
would be withdrawn through filtersticks®® and the tellurium content of
the cooled samples could be determined down to the 1-10 ppm range by
isotopic dilution and mass spectrometry or, at higher levels, by wet
chemical analysis. If Tey” disproportionates significantly, the
behavior of this ion would be studied spectrophotometrically with a

cell and furnace in the light path of the instrument. Quartz cells

were used in previous studies?2s85 and, for longer-term stability,

cells cut from single crystals of lanthanum fluoride or diamond-window
graphite cells may be used. It may be possible to measure the concentra-
tion of these ions directly at temperature as a function of temperature,
melt composition, Te, pressure, etc. Since no light absorption which
would correspond to the absorption by Te?” was detected, 22 the determina-
tion of the solubility of Li,Te will indicate whether Te?= exhibits any
absorption in the common spectral range. If the spectra overlap to

some extent, it may be possible to resolve them through computer treatment
of the data. Measurements would be made in both LijBeFy and thorium-
containing fuel salt.

5.4.6.2 Subtask 4.1.2.2 Behavior of Tez~ in the presence of metals
of construction

 

Even though Tes3™ is stable in melts contained in quartz, and appears
unstable in the presence of strong metallic reductants such as chromium
and beryllium,2? it is necessary to know whether more noble metals and
alloys (Ni, Hastelloy, etc.) can decompose the Tez”. This can be learned
from spectrophotometric measurements similar to those described in the
previous tasks.

5.4.6.3 Subtask 4.1.2.3 Oxidation-reduction chemistry of tellurium
in fuel salt containing uranium

With the information developed in the two previous subtasks it will

be possible to design experiments to measure the effect of the p3tjutt
ratio in the fuel salt on the species of tellurium present and on their
distribution between gas, liquid and solid phases. The solids could be
insoluble tellurides of lithium or other melt constituents such as
uranium telluride,%7:68 UTe,. The free energies of formation of the
various tellurides are not known, with the exception®? of Li,Te, and

it is not possible to predict which telluride would be least soluble.
From the results of these experiments it may be possible to propose
methods for dealing with tellurium in the MSBR system.

The experiments would be carried out in a stirred vessel or rocking
reactor at temperatures of 500-800°C. Provision would be made for
adjusting the u3t/utt ratio during an experimental run. It would be
desirable to use spectrophotometric methods for on-line analysis;
however, if uranium absorbance negates that method it may be possible
to use potentiometric methods. If the tellurium solubility is high
enough, samples could be withdrawn through a filter stick and
subsequently analyzed.

5.4.6.4 Subtask 4.1.2.4 Preparation of metallurgical samples

A test facility to expose metallurgical samples to controlled amounts
of tellurium at elevated temperatures will be an integral part of the
program described in Section 2 to develop modified Hastelloy N alloys
which are resistant to tellurium intergranular attack. Facilities will
be designed to simulate exposure of the MSBR containment vessel both

to tellurium gas in the vapor space above the fuel salt and to contact
with salt containing tellurium and/or tellurides. It is important to
investigate the attack on samples in fluoride melts since the molten
salt could strip protective films of oxide or fluorides from the specimens
and accelerate grain boundary corrosion. For the vapor-phase exposure,
the tensile test specimens and a calculated amount of tellurium metal
will be placed in evacuated quartz tubes such that the sample and the
tellurium can be held at different temperatures. ’? Thus, the specimen
5-30

can be maintained at any designated temperature and the deposition rate
of the tellurium can be independently established. In the initial tests,
a 1000-hr deposition period will be employed.

A different experimental approach will be required to simulate exposure
to tellurium-containing fuel salt. Again, a reaction vessel with a
graphite or boron nitride liner will be employed. The samples would
be placed in the fluoride melt in the crucible and maintained at
temperature. The tellurium could be transferred at a controlled rate
to the melt by evaporation of tellurium metal at a lower temperature

or could be added at intervals as solid Li,Te and/or LiTes.

5.4.7 Task 4.1.3 Phase behavior of PuFq in fuel salt

 

The solubility of PuF3 in LiF-BeF,~ThF, (72-16-12 mole Z%)} has been
measured at ORNL?" and at the Bhabba Atomic Research Centre, India.?®
The values measured in India are about 20% lower than those at ORNL.
The ORNL data resulted from three independent methods of analyses:

¥ — counting of the 241 pm present, og-pulse-height counting, and neutron
activation. Determinations of plutonium in India were made by means of
potentiometry and a-pulse-height counting. A reexamination of the ex-
perimental techniques employed at ORNL and, to a lesser extent of those
at BARC, did not reveal the source of the discrepancy. ’?! The data
revealed good internal consistency for each set, thus suggesting that
the difference noted may be due to differences between the plutonium
standards used by each analytical group.

Since Bhabba Atomic Research Centre has measured the solubility of PuFj
in a wide composition range of molten fluorides, it seems reasonable to
reevaluate the analytical methods used for plutonium at ORNL followed,
if necessary, by measurements of the solubility of PuF3 in molten
fluorides of composition near that proposed for MSBR fuels.

5.4.8 Task 4.1.4 Fuel-coolant interaction studies

The conceptual design of a 1000-Mi(e) MSBR power station" calls for
four shell-and-tube type primary heat exchangers, each having 5896
tubes of 3/8-in.-diameter and 22.2 ft in length. It is assumed that
some tube failures will occur during the life of the power station;
therefore, the heat exchanger design incorporates provisions for tube-
bundle replacement or tube plugging by remote operation. Tube failures
will, of course, lead to mixing of fuel salt and coolant. It is
necessary that sufficient knowledge be developed to assure that events
resulting from such mixing do not lead to consequences which could
endanger the safety or viability of the reactor system.
 

 

5-31

Some experimental work has been done previously to investigate fuel

and coolant mixing. In some cases, however, the results were pre-
liminary in nature and, to some extent inconclusive, at least as far

as defining practical operating parameters with regard to reactor
safety. It was found?® that two immiscible phases resulted when NaBF,
or KBF, (these experiments did not use the eutectic coolant mixture of
NaBF, and NaF) and various fluoride mixtures were mixed at 480°C. No
chemical analyses of the major components of the phases were obtained
and no BF3 pressure measurements were made. The presence of UF, in

the NaBFy-rich phase could not be detected spectrophotometrically.

In another series of tests at 600°C, mixtures of NaBF, and Li,BeF, were
heated in nickel capsules, quenched, and the two phases analyzed. 4 The
regulting phases appeared to be reciprocal mixtures of the ions Li ,

Na , BF; and BeF,%” and appreciable quantities of all ions were found
in both phases. Changes in miscibility can occur rapidly with changes
in temperature, and quenching the melt prior to sampling is not an ideal
procedure since substantial redistribution of components could occur
during cooling.

One series of experiments was carried out to investigate the BF;
pressure over one mixture of LiF-BeF,~ThF, (72-16-12 mole 7%) and
NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole %) coolant.’? The mixture was not stirred and
was slowly heated in an autoclave. Pressure readings were recorded
to 647°C where an overpressure of 95 psia was obtained. The magnitude
of the reported pressure was 13 times higher than the BF; pressure
over NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole 7} at a given temperature. Equilibration
was achieved only slowly, and the pressure continued to increase
after the measurements were recorded and BF3; was then vented to the
hood. The BF3 can be considered to be generated by dissociation of
the NaBF, and dissolution of the NaF in the fuel salt, thus lowering
the NaF activity

NaBF, (2) = BF3(g) + NaF(d) .

Questions concerning the attainment of equilibrium in this experiment
suggest that the results may not represent the maximum pressure. Also,
the investigation covered only one ratio of fuel and coolant.

Subsequently, a careful investigation of the solubility of BF3 in fuel
salt was completed3® and the equilibrium BF3 pressures were measured

for several molten salt compositions over a wide temperature range. In
some experiments NaF was added, giving a composition of LiF-BeF,-ThF,-
NaF (66~15-11~8 mole %) to simulate the in-leakage of NaBF, coolant

to fuel salt. The equilibrated molten salt was not examined for two-
phase formation but discontinuities were not encountered in the BFj
pressure data, suggesting that no phase disengagement occurred. Consider-
ation of the result of small leaks and massive leaks of coolant into fuel
indicated that excessive BFj3 pressures would not be encountered.
5-32
In the operation of a large pump loop with NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole 7%)
coolant, ’3 a uranium-and thorium-containing precipitate was obtained
which resulted from the mixing of residual fuel salt in the loop with i
the flush charge of coolant. This was reported?” to be 7NaF+6(Th,U}F,.
These results are consistent with the previous finding2® that UF, was
insoluble in NaBF,.

These experiments are subject to criticism in that they are in some

instances (a) preliminary, (b) do not cover the temperature range of

850-1300°F expected in the primary heat exchangers," (c) cover only Ee
one or a limited range of fuel-coolant ratios and, (d) in one case,
represent a relatively uncontrolled mixing experiment. Regardless,
it is possible to draw some generalized conclusions concerning the
results of mixing.

If fuel leaks into the coolant, the uranium and thorium will precipi-
tate. Probably most or all of the trivalent or higher-valent cations,
such as protactinium, fission products, etc., would also precipitate.
Two immiscible phases may be formed when large volumes of fuel leak into
the coolant and many of the constituents may distribute between these a
phases. In addition, radicactive contamination of the coolant system

would result.

If coolant leaks into the fuel, it is less clear what events will occur.
The NaBF, will partially dissociate and BF3 gas will be evolved. It is

not known if this would evolve smoothly or in surges as the two immis-

cible liquids reacted. Eventually, after some unknown volume of coolant Bs
mixes with fuel, two stable immiscible phases may be formed and all the

ions may distribute between these two phases. It is not possible to

predict what the uranium or thorium concentration would be in each a
phase. In addition, of course, boron is a nuclear poison and must be

removed (as BF; gas) for the fuel to be operable; very small concentra-

tions would be removed by neutron absorption.

In order to resolve these important safety-related questions, the
following subtasks have been defined to investigate the phase equilibria,
the distribution of major and minor components between the two phases
and to simulate the dynamic non-equilibrium conditions to be encountered
in an actual leak. Leaks in either direction through the heat exchanger
will be considered; fuel inte coolant as well as coolant inte fuel. i
The experiments should also indicate the events to be encountered in
transient situations, for example cooling the salt after reactor shut-
down following detection of a leak. Since phase immiscibility can be
highly temperature dependent, two-phase formation could be more pro-
nounced at lower temperatures during cool down. If there is substantial
distribution of the components between the phases, the freezing point

of the new phases could be substantially different from fuel or coolant. E
If the freezing point is higher, then material could freeze in the heat

exchanger in the vicinity of a leak.

 
 

 

5-33

5.4.8.1 Subtask 4.1.4.1 Phase equilibria

The preliminary experiments?6 suggested that two immiscible phases could
be formed when fuel and coolant were mixed, but the ratio of fuel to
coolant over which this behavior occurs and the composition of the phases
were not well defined. The first series of experiments will investigate
the mixing at wide ranges of fuel/coolant ratio, thus simulating leaks

in either direction through the primary heat exchanger, and over a temper-
ature range from the maximum anticipated temperature to the freezing
point of the phases. The experiments will be designed so that the volume
of the resulting phases can be measured and the phases can be sampled at
temperature. For short term experiments, quartz containment may be
adequate and would simplify observation of the two phases. For longer
term experiments at the higher temperatures, the experiments could be
repeated in nickel or Hastelloy N reactors to avoid SiF, and oxide con-
tamination of the melt. The conductivity of the two phases may be
sufficiently dissimilar that an adjustable conductivity probe could be
used to locate the interface. A complete analysis would be performed

for all melt constituents, both major and minor. The pressure would be
maintained arbitrarily at 1 atmosphere and the quantity of BF3 evolved
would be measured. It may be necessary to stir the reaction vessel to
ensure rapid attainment of equilibrium. Since, in an MSBR, the gas

space over the fuel will be swept with helium, it may be desirable to
subsequently introduce that feature in the experimental design to evalu-
ate the residual BF3 composition of the melt. With the information
developed in these experiments, it will be possible to evaluate the
problems of phase immiscibility, uranium and thorium distribution and
precipitation, and freezing point depression.

Additional experiments may then be needed to define the distribution of
plutonium and possibly other actinides since some MSBR concepts include
using plutonium as the initial fuel, and molten-salt converter reactors
could operate with plutonium fuel makeup. It is desirable to investi-
gate the distribution of fission product elements in the two-phase
system. If radioactive tracers are used, these experiments may require
some shielding.

5.4.8.2 Subtask 4.1.4.2 Dynamic investigations

 

The phase equilibria experiments described in the preceeding section
plus the previously completed BF3 pressure data3® will be adequate to
evaluate the effect of small leaks. Large leaks, or the sudden mixing
of large volumes of fuel and coolant, present a more complex situation.
They involve a non-equilibrium situation and dynamic experiments must
be carried out to investigate reaction rates in addition to equilibrium
conditions.
5-34

The rate of evolution of BF3 gas following a sudden mixing is important
in determining the maximum transient pressure in a damaged heat ex-
changer and in evaluating the potential for physical failure of the
heat exchanger shell. To measure the rate of reaction of coolant and
fuel, a suitable experimental stand allowing for pressure transients
would be required. Pressure transducers capable of recording pressure
transients would be utilized and volumes of fuel and ccolant would be
mixed under well defined conditions.

In the case of a leak of coclant into fuel salt, the environment in

the area near the leak will be high in BF, concentration, and insoluble
fluorides such as the 7NaF-6(Th,U}F, previously observed?’ may be formed.
These would be dispersed by the fuel salt flow and mixed into the bulk
of the fuel salt in the reactor. If they do not readily redissolve,
deposits of solids could develop; thus, the rate of redissolution of the
uranium-thorium precipitate in fuel salt needs to be examined. Typical
solid precipitates would be prepared and their rate of dissolution
studied. These experiments could be carried out in conventional stirred
nickel reactors and the contents sampled.

The possibility of freezing a phase having a higher melting point in
the vicinity of a leak due to non-equilibrium concentrations near the
leak would be investigated. In addition to mathematical simulation of
the heat transfer in such a situation, a test apparatus could be built
to demonstrate the potential for freezing with various controlled leak
rates.

5.4.9 Task 4.1.5 Physical property determinations on fuel salt

 

The last critically-compiled set of physical properties of possible

fuel salt compositions was reported ?® in August 1968. Since then,
density and viscosity of several fluoride melts have been measured. 29
From these measurements, the density and viscosity of fuel salt are
known, respectively, to +3%Z and +10%Z. The heat-capacity of fuel

salt LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12 mole %) has been derived from drop calorim-
etry; 28 on the basis of this determination and a simple model for
predicting heat capacity of molten fluorides, one can reliably predict

the heat-capacity of the fuel salt.

Thermal conductivity is the key property for predicting heat-transfer
coefficients of molten fluorides. Measurements that are probably
accurate to +10 to 157 have been obtained for LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF,
(67.5-20-12-0.5 mole %).”% It will be helpful for future design con-
siderations te develop an apparatus to measure thermal conductivities
of fluorides with greater accuracy and to determine the conductivity
of the presently proposed fuel salt composition in such an apparatus.

The surface physical properties {surface tension and interfacial tension
between salt and graphite) are only known qualitatively. Such proper-
ties are important in assessing wetting behavior and in determining the
degree of penetration of salt into graphite.

 
 

5-35

The vapor pressure, as yet unmeasured, has been extrapolated from
measurements of LiF-BeF, and LiF-UF), mixtures. At the highest normal
operating temperature, 704°C, the estimated vapor pressure is approx-
imately 1072 torr. The vapor composition has not been measured but
would be considerably enriched in BeF, and, perhaps, in ThFy. Vapor
pressure and vapor composition are not high-priority measurements.
However, calculations of how much salt and of what composition is
transported by gas sparging to cool portions of the off-gas system in
the primary system will require something more than qualitative esti-
mates. A transpiration experiment would provide firm values of vapor
composition and improved values of the vapor pressure. Manometric
measurements combined with mass-spectrographic determination would
provide more precise information on both.

5.4.9.1 Subtask 4.1.5.1 Thermal conductivity

An investigation would be made to determine if the variable-gap appa-
ratus previously used’? is suitable for further measurements. If not,
consideration would be given as to whether a modified variable-gap,
hot-wire, or some other technique might be more suitable. There is

also some virtue in testing all molten-salt thermal conductivity data
against models by which thermal conductivity can be adequately predicted.

5.4.9.2 Subtask 4.1.5.2 Surface properties

 

A visual sessile-drop apparatus would be assembled to examine contact
angles of fuel salt on graphites; the same general apparatus would be
used with liquid metals and salts of interest to chemical processing.
Apparatus would be assembled and operated to measure surface tension
of salts (and perhaps metals) by the maximum bubble pressure technique.
The salt-graphite interfacial studies initiated previously would be
completed.

5.4.9.3 Subtask 4.1.5.3 Vapor pressure and composition
The pressure and composition of vapor of MSBR fuel salt would be

measured by a combination of transpiration, vapor-pressure and mass-
spectrographic determinations over the temperature range 500° to 1400°C.

5.4.10 Task 4.1.6 Uust/u4t equilibria studies

Experience with the fuel salt redox chemistry has shown that the upper
and lower limits of the U3H/U“T ratio that are permissible in an MSBR
are governed by several factors. The ratio must be high enough to
prevent corrosion of the container through the reaction:

UF, (d) + 1/2 Cr(ss) = UF3(d) + 1/2 CrF,(d)
5-36
and to prevent the precipitation of Pa,0g through the reaction:
ut + 5/2 027 + Patt = 1/2 Pa,05(c) + UST. ah
It has been estimated’® that ratios greater than 0.05 should be adequate
in controlling both of these processes.
On the other hand, the ratio must be low enough to prevent reaction of
ust with graphite through the reaction gE

4UF4(d) + 2C(graphite) = 3UF,(d) + UC, (s)

it has been shown3C that, at 550°C, ratios less than 0.1 for typical fuel

salt concentrations will be stable in solutions with free fluoride ion

concentrations similar to Li,BeF,. Evidence has also been found3® which =
suggests that oxide impurities may shift the above carbide equilibrium

to the right by the formation of more stable uranium oxycarbide phases.

If such oxycarbide phases do indeed form, the pdt yt ratio may have to a
be held at values less than than 0.1.

The effect of oxygen-related impurities on the UF3-UF, solution equilib-
rium will be examined to determine to what extent low concentrations of
oxide shift the maximum USt/U"t ratio which is otherwise determined by
4UF3(d) + 2C (graphite) = 3UF,(d) + UC,(s). The possible formation of
uranium oxycarbide phases when U3Y reacts with graphite in the presence
of oxide ion will be examined from 450 to 700°C. Identification of these
phases will be made and related to the oxide ion concentration of the
melt and/or oxygen partial pressure over the system. oo

The chief experimental technique to be used in this study is the measure-

ment of UF; and UF, concentrations of fuel salts in the temperature range y
of interest using a diamond-windowed cell.”’ Spectra in the near-infrared fe
and visible regions will be generated by means eof a Cary-14 HE spectrom~
eter. In addition, long term equilibration studies will be conducted

in sealed containers involving larger amounts of material in an effort

to generate, identify and characterize possible uranium oxycarbide phases
or other solid mixed-composition phases. Several analytical tools will
be used to characterize the isolated phases, such as x-ray diffraction, Co
chemical analysis, petrography and metallography.

5.5 TASK GROUP 4.2 COOLANT SALT CHEMISTRY

5.5.1 Objective

The objective of this task group is to develop an understanding of the
chemical parameters of the coolant. Particular emphasis will be given
to tritium trapping and corrosion reactions. This portion of the program
plan is complicated by the possible selection of an alternate coolant in
place of fluoroborate. If that occurs, the program plan must be changed
in light of the research needed for the new coolant.

5.5.2 Schedule

The schedule for work in this task group is given in Table 5.5.2.

5.5.3. Funding

The operating fund requirements for this task group are summarized in
Table 5.5.3.1, and the capital equipment fund requirements are summarized
in Table 5.5.3.2.

5.5.4 Facilities
No special facilities are needed for this research. Existing laboratories

in Building 4500S are adequate.

5.5.5 Task 4.2.1 Oxide and hydroxide chemistry of fluoroborate

 

The presence of oxide and hydroxide species in NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole 7%),
even in low concentrations, will have effects on corrosion of the
Hastelloy N and on reactions with tritium. At higher concentrations,
as would occur if steam leaked into the coolant circuit, more extensive
corrosion would occur; in addition, the vapor over the coolant would
change from all BF3 to vapor species also containing hydrogen and
oxygen. The hydrogen-containing species may be important in sparging
tritium out of the coolant circuit. The experimental efforts of the
past! have barely begun to elucidate the important, but complex, chem-
istry of these species.

It is clear that a much more complete understanding of oxide and hydroxide
species will have to be achieved before these species can be employed in
schemes to control tritium migration, before corrosion can be accurately
predicted, or fluorcborate produced at the required purity.

5.5.5.1 Subtask 4.2.1.1 Identification of oxide-containing species

The chemical formula and structure of oxide and hydroxide species both
in the melt and in the vapor are vital information that will be applied
to the practical problems of corrosion, tritium control and impurity
removal in fluorcborate coolant.

The ion BF30H has been positively identified in fluoroborate coolant
from measurements of its infrared absorption spectrum. 33 This species,
in low concentration at 425°C, is apparently stable for a few days.
Infrared study of the melts suggests that one or more additional oxygen-
containing species are also present. 33 Solid NaBF30H has been reported’?
to undergo a bimolecular condensation reaction at 100-120°C to yield
H,0(g) and Na,B,Fg0. The same paper notes that, at 240°C, NayByFg0
disproportionates into Na3B3FgO3 and NaBF,. It is possible that these
oxides may exist in molten fluoroborate.

These complex oxides along with some other related compounds will be
synthesized for the purposes of "finger printing" (by infrared, NMR,

and other techniques) and to study their dissolution and volatilization
behavior in melten fluoroborate. The compounds to be prepared will in-
clude Na,B,Fg0, NagB3Fg03, Na3B3Fs503(OH), BF3-H,0, BF3°2H,0, BF,0H and
BF,0H-H,0. This list is necessarily tentative because investigations

of reactivity and volatilization may decrease (or possibly increase) the
number of significant species in molten fluoroborate or its vapor. Nuclear
magnetic resonance (proton, fluorine, boron-11) will be the primary tool
by which volatile species will be identified. Infrared absorption spectra
will be used for identifying species in the solid or liquid states.

5.5.5.2 Subtask 4.2.1.2 Reaction of H,;0 with NaBF,

 

Hydrolysis equilibria, the simplest of which may be written as

H,0(g) + NaBF,(d) = NaBF30H(d) + HF(g), are particularly important in
assessing corrosion, in devising tritium contrel schemes, and in cecolant
purification. Study of these equilibria is hampered by the presence of
gaseous BF3 and B-O-F compounds and possibly by condensation of NaBF30H
into one or more complex oxides. Nevertheless, fluoroborates have been
purified to some extent by sparging with gaseous mixtures of HF and

BF, 9 the latter serving to maintain the composition of the melt. The
limited success of this procedure suggests that the reverse of the above
reaction may be used for initial purification of fluoroborate if vendors
cannot supply adequately purified material (see Task 4.2.3).

Hydrolysis equilibria will be investigated in parallel with the synthesis
and identification efforts (see Subtask 4.2.1.1). Composition of solid,
liquid and vapor phases will be studied at MSBR operating temperatures,
depending primarily, but not exclusively, upon chemical analysis and
upon infrared and NMR spectra.
5~44

5.5.5.3 Subtask 4.2.1.3 Tritium trapping in fluorcboroate

 

An important development objective in the development of molten-salt

reactors {converters as well as breeders) is tc prevent all, or virtually
all, of the tritium which diffuses into the coolant circuit from reaching
the steam system. The fluorcoborate coolant offers a reasonable potential

for meeting this objective through two types of chemical reaction —
oxidation and isotope exchange.

Initial attempts 80 to exchange deuterium for the protium in the ionic
species BF30H” were not successful. Instead, BF30D” formed in the melt;
this result suggested that oxidation (by structural metal ions) of
deuterium occurred rather than isotope exchange. By inference, then,
oxidation of tritium may be the more fruitful path toward trapping
tritium in the coolant. The reaction

1/2 Hy(g) + Ni?*t + 027 = Ni(alloy) + CH

will be studied in a systematic fashion.

Tritium removal schemes via complex volatile species will be investigated

after sufficient information has been obtained about these species (Sub-
tasks 4.2.1.1 and 4.2.1.2).

1f oxidation reactions can successfully lead to trapping of tritium in
fluorcborate coolant, it will still be necessary to process the coclant
for removal of the tritium. Reaction with CF; may be effective in this
regard. Study of the reaction

OT (d) + 1/2 CF,(g) = 1/2 CO»(g) + F (d) + TF(g)
would follow the demonstrated capability of using CF, in purification of
the coolant (see Subtask 4.2.3.2).

5.5.6 Task 4.2.2 Corrosion chemistry of fluorcborate

5.5.6.1 Subtask 4.2.2.1 Free energy of formation of corrosion products

The chemical nature of the coolant will be a significant factor in fixing
the form and stability of the containment metals that are oxidized (i.e.,

corroded) during reactor operations. With fluoroborate coolant salts,
loop and capsule experiments have shown that Ni%%t, Fe2*, and Cr3+ ions
are slightly soluble corrosion products. When the solubility limit of
these ions is exceeded, they precipitate as ionic complex compounds —
NaNiF3, NaFeF3, NazCrFg. The free energies of formation (AG2) of these
compounds must be known not only to characterize the extent of corrosion
in fluorcborates, but also to predict what redox reactions are likely to
reverse or counter the metal oxidation. The free energies of formation
of NaNiF; and NaFeF3 have already been published. 3 Experiments are

underway to obtain AGE of NajCrFg by means of the reaction,

 
Ca

 

5-45

3NaBF, (melt) + CrF3(s) = Na3CrFg(s) + 3BF3(g)

By combining the measured partial pressure of BFj3, the previously determined
activity of NaBFy,%! and the published®? 469 of CrF3(s), AGP of Na3CrFg
will be obtained.

It should be noted that the chemical formula and stability of chromium,
nickel and iron corrosion products formed in other NaF-containing
coolants may be similar to those which form in fluoroborate coolant.

Since titanium is a significant constituent of MSBR containment alloys,
the corrosion thermodynamics of titanium in the coolant will also be
studied. This includes investigations of the stability of trivalent
titanium and of the existence and solubility of Na3TiFg, NaTiF, or other
complex salts.

5.5.6.2 Subtask 4.2.2.2 Boride formation

Boron in fluorcborate coolant may possibly oxidize constituents of the
contaimment alloys such that reduced boron may deposit on metal surfaces.
Two examples of such possible reactions with negative standard free energy
changes are:

NaBF, + 2NaF + 3Cr = NajCrFg + CryB
NaBF, + Ti = TiF; + NaF + 1/2 TiB,

(The latter reaction may lead to Na3TiFg, whose formation free energy
will be investigated under Subtask 4.2.2.1). If boron deposition should
occur in MSBR primary heat-exchangers and if the diffusivity of the

boron in Hastelloy N is sufficiently high, embrittlement of the Hastel-
loy N might result via helium produced by delayed neutrons in the reaction
10g (n,a) Li. On the other hand, if the deposited boron remained on the
metal surface, radiation damage would be of little consequence. Thus,

as long as fluoroborate is a candidate coolant for breeder reactors, it

is necessary to investigate boride formation and diffusion in metals used
in the primary heat exchangers.

initial experiments of boride formation on Hastelloy N and other alloys
will be carried out with specimens in contact with NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole
%) for times varying between two weeks and six months; the specimens
will be analyzed for boron penetration. If these results indicate
significant penetration of boron into metal specimens, accurate deter-
minations of boron diffusion rates will be carried out.
 

 

5-46
5.5.7 Task 4.2.3 Coolant purification
5.5.7.1 Subtask 4.2.3.1 Initial purification i
It is known from loop tests that deliberate addition of water, even in
rather small quantities, will amplify the corrosivity of flucroborate

coolant.®® It is, therefore, necessary for the salt to be as dry as
practicable. Commercially available NaBF,, when recrystallized from
dilute aqueous HF, can be purified to concentrations as low as 4 ppm in
protons and 200 ppm in oxide.8% Other impurities that cause corrosion a
are metallic ions, notably ferrous or ferric ions; these may be introduced
into commercial RaBF, when steel equipment is used in the salt preparation.
It is also necessary to guard against the introduction of impurities such
as cobalt which would be easily activated by delayed neutrons in the
primary heat-exchangers. There is a need to contact and work with a
vendor (presumably Harshaw) to determine how the bench-scale purification
can be scaled-up and how harmful metallic ions can be either kept out

or minimized in the delivered product. If the vendor cannot supply an
adequately purified material, application of the HF(g) + BF5(g) sparging
method should be strongly considered (see Subtask 4.2.1.2).

 

5.5.7.2 Subtask 4.2.3.2 In-reactor purification

 

During the life of an MSBR there is a finite probability that a steam
lezk will occur and that it will be necessary to process the coolant

for proton removal and possibly to lower the oxide concentration. wi
Corrosion will have to be kept at a low level to prevent entrained

solids (like Na;CrFg) from clogging coolant passages in steam gener-

ators and heat exchangers. Accurate solubilities of corrosion product a
ions should be known (see Section 5.5.9.3, Subtask 4.2.5.3). Practical
on-line purification as well as tritium removal probably involves de-
signing by-pass facilities (such as a coclant drain tank lined with
graphite) where one or more processing operations can be carried out.

A possible method for removing oxide and protons (tritons) from the
coolant involves reactions with CFy:

 

027(d) + 1/2 CF,(g) = 1/2 CO,(g) + 2F (d)

OH (d) + 1/2 CF,(g) = 1/2 CO,(g) + F (d) + HF(g) . i
Preliminary experiments®’ failed to identify C0, as a reaction product,
but this may have been due to difficulties in analyzing a complicated
effluent gas stream containing HF, H,;0, BF3, CO, and unreacted CF.

A combination of gas chromatographic, mass-spectrographic and infrared
analytical methods should solve these difficulties. Experimental work
would focus on the equilibrium aspects of the above reactions. However,
studies of catalysis may be necessary should these reactions prove to
proceed slowly.

 
 

5-47

5.5.8 Task 4.2.4 Alternate coolant evaluation

 

Although it now appears that the fluoroborate coolant, NaBF,-NaF (92-8
mole %), can be utilized in an MSBR system with suitable compromise of
design parameters and previous considerations of alternate coolants have
not revealed a more ideal coolant, it was deemed desirable to make a
reevaluation of the coolant selection. Less than ideal attributes

of the fluoroborate are its high melting point and corrosivity toward
Hastelloy N upon the addition of moisture. Experimentally unresolved
aspects include compatibility with fuel salt and tritium trapping.
Therefore, alternate coolants will be evaluated.

5.5.8.1 Subtask 4.2.4.1 Interim report

In this investigation, fluoroborate and other fluids will be evaluated
in terms of the constraints and requirements imposed upon the coolant

of an MSBR. Nine general attributes {constraints and requirements) have
been identified:

1. The consequences of accidental mixing of coolant and fuel must
be minimal and reversible.

2. It is highly desirable that the coolant should sequester virtually
all tritium diffusing into the coolant circuit.

3. The coolant must be compatible with components which it contacts
normally.

4. Leaks in the steam-raising system must be tolerable.

5. Radiation within the primary heat-exchanger should have minimal
detrimental effects upon the vapor pressure, composition and
compatibility of the coolant.

6. The coolant should have acceptable heat-transfer and fluid
properties; the properties of the coolant should not necessitate
a greatly increased fuel inventory, thereby lessening the breeding
performance of the reactor.

7. The coolant should have a freezing point below 600°F.

8. The coolant should exhibit a low vapor pressure at normal operating
temperatures.

9. The coolant should be inexpensive and available in high purity.

An in-depth evaluation of potential coolants is underway. Since it is
possible that a single coolant may not fill all the requirements of an
MSBR, consideration will also be given to two-coolant loops.’ A draft
report will be prepared and circulated for comment. Comments will be
discussed and incorporated into a final report.
5-48

5.5.8.2 Subtask 4.2.4.2 Final evaluation

 

The results of the previous subtask will include recommendations for
laboratory experiments. The results of these experiments will have an
important bearing on the ultimate selection of the coolant. When the
coolant evaluation is completed, a final report containing the results
and recommendations will be issued.

5.5.9 Task 4.2.5 Physical property determinations on coolants

 

The number of measurements and general effort required will depend,

to some extent, upon the coolant chosen on the basis of the assessment
(Task 4.2.4) currently underway. Viscosity, 2? density, 2° and heat
capacity®® of NaBF,~NaF (92-8 mole %) are known with sufficient accu-
racy for most purposes.

5.5.9.1 Subtask 4.2.5.1 Thermal conductivity

 

If NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole %) is the ultimate selection as the coolant, its
thermal conductivity should be determined with higher precision than pre-
viously reported.®” The apparatus should be the same as that used for
determining thermal conductivity of the fuel salt (see 5.4.9.1, Subtask
4.1.5.1).

5.5.9.2 Subtask 4.2.5.2 Surface tension
The surface tension of the coolant should be measured in the same appa-

ratus as that used for the fuel salt (see 5.4.9.2, Subtask 4.1.5.2).

5.5.9.3 Subtask 4.2.5.3 Solubility of corrosion products

 

In order to properly assess the consequences of corrosion by the coolant,
it is necessary to have an adequate data base. Corrosion-product solu-
bility as a function of temperature is an integral component of the data
base. In fluoroborate coolant, the sclubility of NasCrFg (a corrosion
product observed in virtually all loop tests) has been measured. How-
ever, the reported data were quite scattered in the range 450-550°C;
also, the data were obtained at lower NaF concentrations than would be
used in the fluoroborate coolant. Since removal of NazCrFg would be
important in any coolant loop containing fluorcoborate, it would be use-
ful to determine more accurately the solubilities of NazCrFg in NaBF,-NaF
(92-8 mole %). Once corrosion of chromium becomes limited by diffusion
within Hastelloy N, structural metal corrosion in fluoroborate becomes
the oxidation of nickel; the corrosion product, NaNiF;, will precipitate
when the coolant is saturated with Ni2T, Accordingly, solubility measure-
ments of NaNiFj3 in fluoroborate are very desirable.

 
5-49

5.5.9.4 Subtask 4.2.5.4 Other physical properties of flucroborate and
alternate coolants

If an alternate coolant is chosen, physical properties would be determined
as required. For instance, if a BeF,-containing salt were the candidate,
the viscosity should probably be measured.

If fluoroborate is retained as coolant, the density change upon melting
should be measured. This information is probably necessary in order to
predict stresses that may occur in the steam-raising system, assuming
some of the coolant is allowed to freeze on baffle plates, etc.

5.6 TASK GROUP 4.3 TRITIUM BEHAVIOR

5.6.1 Objective

The objective of this task group is to obtain the data and develop the
technology necessary to limit to acceptable levels the rate at which
tritium is released from molten-salt reactors.

The necessary data include permeabilities, solubilities, and diffusivi-
ties of tritium, both pure and mixed with other hydrogen isotopes, in
salts and metals, and information on equilibria and reactions between
tritium and materials present in an MSBR. A major objective is to
determine whether an oxide film can be formed on the steam side of the
steam generator which will significantly reduce the tritium permeation
rate.

5.6.2 Schedule

The schedule for work in this task group is given in Table 5.6.2.

5.6.3 Funding

The operating fund requirements for this task group are summarized in
Table 5.6.3.1, and the capital equipment fund requirements are summarized
in Table 5.6.3.2.

5.6.4 Facilities

Construction of a high-pressure, high-temperature steam loop test facility
may be required as part of the study of oxide stability in steam systems,
Subtask 4.3.1.2. This major facility would permit studies to be made of
the solubilities, transport, and long-term effectiveness of oxide films

as tritium barriers. Contrcl of the steam chemistry and capability of
handling tritium could be achieved in the facility. Both permeation

rates and chemical changes of oxides with time could be studied. The
facility would cost approximately $200,000 and would require approximately
two years for design and construction.

5.6.5 Task 4.3.1 Permeation studies

 

5.6.5.1 Subtask 4.3.1.1 Permeation of clean and oxided metals

Measurements will be made of the rate at which tritium permeates candi-
date structural and steam generator materials in contact with gas of
controlled dewpoint and hydrogen content. Precise measurements will be
made using tritium as permeant in the presence of an excess of hydrogen
in order to minimize transient and wall effects.

Studies will be carried out to determine the range of alloy compositions
which will form useful tritium permeation barriers on potential steam
generator materials when oxidized by supercritical steam. Initial work
will include the construction of the appropriate apparatus and, then,
measuring permeation through clean structural alloys, and through
candidate steam generator alloys using steam having a dewpoint below
100°C. Oxides obtained on the potentially useful materials will be
analyzed by Auger and ESCA methods and compared with oxides formed with
other time-temperature histories. These latter oxides would be prepared
in a separate facility — an oxidation test stand. Subsequent work in
this subtask will involve additional screening tests for candidate steam
generator materials and determination of long-term changes in oxide com-
position and structure.

5.6.5.2 Subtask 4.3.1.2 Stability of oxides in steam systems

Work in this subtask is concerned with determination of the chemical
form, stability, and long-term effectiveness in retarding tritium per-
meation of oxide films formed on potential steam generator materials

in the presence of high-pressure steam. Since the characteristics of
corrosion oxide films formed in the boiler and superheater regions may
differ, two test devices of small scale (4-cm-diam x 70-cm-long) will

be constructed and operated with continuous monitoring of the tritium
permeation. Both cool-down and heatup cycles of the boiler will be used
to simulate thermal transients expected in MSBR steam systems. The test
barrier oxides will be subjected to a variety of operating conditions.

If it is shown that oxide films are stable on candidate steam generator
materials and that the oxides provide a significance resistance to tritium
permeation, determination of the role of steam chemistry on the oxide for-
mation and effectiveness will be needed. A larger-scale (10-cm-diam x
200-cm—long) pumped-loop facility would be used for studies in which the
steam composition would be varied to provide information on the tolerance
of the oxide to changes in chemical environment expected in a supercritical
steam system.

5.6.6 Task 4.3.2 Solubility of tritium~containing species in molten salts
5.6.6.1 Subtask 4.3.2.1 Solubility of tritium in fuel salt

This subtask is related closely to Task 4.3.6, since both solubility and
diffusivity are involved in transport of tritium to sparge gas bubbles
or graphite and heat exchanger tube surfaces. The purpose of this sub-
task is to measure tritium solubility in fuel salt.

This measurement for hydrogen has proven to be difficult in the past ,*1,88,89
principally because of leakage and permeation of the hydrogen from the
apparatus coupled with the very small quantities of tritium used in the
measurements. However, in the presence of an excess of hydrogen, tritium
permeates metals at a lower rate and also can be detected with great sensi-
tivity. A mixed-isotope method should therefore be useful in determining
tritium solubility. The high sensitivity with which tritium can be
detected will also permit saturation of the salt to occur without using

gas bubbles, which can complicate the interpretation of the data. Using

a large area of thin-wall tubing, tritium can be introduced by permea-

tion into a salt already saturated with protium. A second tubing section
also having a large area would serve to carry permeated tritium to a
tritium detector. The delay time between the introduction and detection

of the tritium will be a direct measure of the capacity of the salt for
dissolved tritium. This method is analogous to methods used to measure
hydrogen solubility in refractory metals.

5.6.6.2 Subtask 4.3.2.2 Solubility of tritium in coclant salt
The determination of tritium solubility in coeclant salt will be made in
the apparatus used in Subtask 4.3.2.1. Since chemically bound isotopes

may be present in NaBF,-NaF, additional planning based on results from
Task 4.3.4 will be required before this work is initiated.

5.6.6.3 Subtask 4.3.2.3 Solubility of tritium fluoride in fuel salt

 

The principal problems associated with the measurement of tritium fluoride
solubility in fuel salt are the chemical interaction with UF; and the
difficulty in obtaining saturation conditions. These problems probably
can be overcome by using a HF-H, mixture of appropriately chosen compo-
sition to maintain constant oxidation conditions. This mixture would be
recirculated through a quantity of salt and replenished at a low rate.

The transient behavior on adding tritium would be related to the TF and

Ty, solubilities. By appropriate choice of relative and total pressures,
salt compositions, container material and the scale of the apparatus, a
wide range of parameters relating to TF solubilities would be studied.
5-58

5.6.7 Task 4.3.3 Equilibria between important species containing
tritium in salt-gas systems

 

 

The motivations for studying these equilibria are to obtain methods for
preventing tritium, which is generated in the core, from reaching the
steam system of the reactor. There are basically three chemical inter-
actions for "trapping' tritium:

(a) oxidation of molecular or atomic tritium; the oxidized tritium is
then chemically bound in a species that does not permeate hot
metals,

(b) isotope exchange with hydrogen (mass number 1); for instance,
TH + OH = OT + Hy,

{(c) sorption onto graphite or carbon; in the reactor core, sorption

of tritium on graphite is helpful but insufficient for preventing
excessive release of tritium into the coolant circuit.

5.6.7.1 Subtask 4.3.3.1 Fuel salt equilibria

 

In the fuel salt, the oxidizing conditions are governed by the yght/u3t
ratio; this ratio will be fixed at about 100 by the need to prevent
corrosion of chromium, formation of uranium carbide, and oxidation of
the protactinium (see Section 5.4.10). Since strongly oxidizing condi-
tions, i.e. ght/pst ratios greater than 1000, appear to be necessary to
convert all the elemental tritium to tritium fluoride, it is likely that
both T, and TF will be present in the fuel salt. The TF/T, ratio will
be determined as a function of the U*t/U3Y ratio. Mixtures of TF and

Typ will be bubbled through molten fuel salt at constant temperature and
the resulting Ut /u3t ratios will be measured spectrophotometrically.

5.6.7.2 Subtask 4.3.3.2 Coolant salt equilibria

 

From previous measurements>° and from on-going studies (5.5.6.1, Subtask
4.2.2.1) oxidation equilibria of tritium in fluoroborate coolant can be
calculated. However, we do not know the solubility of TF in the coolant.
The solubility values determined under 5.6.6.2, Subtask 4.3.2.2, will be
complemented by study of the equilibrium

1/2 Dy (g) + 1/2 NaNiF3(c) = 1/2 NaF(d) + 1/2 Ni’(c) + DF(g).

In this study, known amounts of deuterium diffusing into a nickel capsule
containing NaNiF; and NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole %)} will be measured. The

same experiment will then be applied to other oxidants (e.g., Na3CrFg)
and, perhaps, to alternate coolants.

pe
5-59

5.6.8 Task 4.3.4 Isotopic exchange between tritium and chemically
bound hydrogen

Although previous attempts? to exchange deuterium for protium in the
species BF 30H have not proved successful, it is by no means certain
that isotope exchange reactions are not feasible in fluoroborate coolant.
Capsule experiments similar to that described above (Subtask 4.3.3.2),
will be performed to study the general reaction

1/2 Dy (g) + t= pt + 1/2 Hy(g)

In these experiments, partial pressures will probably be monitored by
mass spectroscopy.

5.6.9 Task 4.3.5 TF corrosion behavior at low TF activity

 

In the MSBR fuel salt, a large fraction of the tritium would be present
as TF if the USY/U*t ratio were reduced to 0.001. A significant frac-
tion of the tritium could therefore possibly be removed from the fuel
salt as TF if the gas sparge rate were high enough and/or the rate of
reaction of TF with the metal surfaces were very low.%! This subtask
will determine the rates of reaction of HF (or TF) with Hastelloy N

and similar alloys under conditions of low HF (or TF) activity. Since
TF can probably be used in this work, corrosion rates can be determined
by measuring the rate of release of T,.

5.6.10 Task 4.3.6 Diffusivity studies

 

5.6.10.1 Subtask 4.3.6.1 Diffusivity of HT and H, in fuel salt

 

A time-lag permeation method will be employed using deuterium permeation
coupled with an ultra-high vacuum system mass-spectrometer detection
method to determine both the solubility and the diffusivity of deuterium
(initially used as a stand-in for HT and as a calibrating gas) in the
salt. After ascertaining that there is adequate agreement with the in-
dependently measured values of solubility of tritium, Task 4.3.2, the
equipment will be modified for a determination with tritium.

5.6.10.2 Subtask 4.3.6.2 Diffusivity of tritium in coolant salt

Substantially the same approach and equipment used in Subtask 4.3.6.1
will be employed.
5-60

5.6.10.3 Subtask 4.3.6.3 Diffusivity of HF and TF in fuel salt

 

An electrochemical method is expected to be applicable to the determina-
tion of diffusion constants of hydrogen ions in fuel salt. With adequate
sclubility of hydrogen fluoride (Subtask 4.3.2.3), the sensitivity of

the electrochemical method should permit a relatively straightforward
determination as a function of temperature and composition,

5.6.10.4 Subtask 4.3.6.4 Diffusivity of HF and TF in coolant salt

 

Following the completion of Subtask 4.3.6.3, a study of coolant salts
would be undertaken using the same method and equipment.

5.6.11 Task 4.3.7 Modeling of tritium behavior in molten-salt reactors

 

The data on tritium reactions, solubilities, diffusivities, and permeation
obtained in the other tasks of Task Group 4.3 are needed to assess the
distribution of tritium in molten-salt reactors. This task is directed
toward mathematical modeling of the flow and processing of tritium in

the reactor. The approach taken in this task would be similar to that

of Briggs and Korsmeyer. 22 Additions of process variables and the best
new data as it is developed to the calculation would permit the neces~
sary detailed exploration of options for control of tritium in molten-
salt reactors. Work in this task interacts strongly with reactor design
and analysis (Section 8) and reactor technology development (Section 10).

5.6.12 Task 4.3.8 Tritium adsorption on carbon in contact with
the coolant

 

Some of the tritium generated by the MSRE was found within the graphite
moderator, 38 Although a similar situation in an MSBR will be helpful,
it is not likely to prevent excessive amounts of tritium from diffusing
into the coolant. However, it is possible that graphite (or carbon) in
contact with the coolant could adsorb a large fraction of the tritium.
Initial studies have shown that the capacity of carbon for tritium might
be adequate (v10 Ci of T,; per kg of carbon), but that kinetics may be
inadequate to permit high removal efficiency. A catalytic effect of
very thin nickel coatings in enhancing the kinetics would be expected
by analogy with many industrial catalytic processes. This subtask
would be directed toward the preparation and testing of nickel coatings,
and determining the feasibility of this approach for removing tritium
from the coolant.

5.7 TASK GROUP 4.4 FISSION PRODUCT CHEMISTRY

5.7.1 Objective

Emphasis will be placed on clarifying the behavior of the noble metal
fission products with particular attention focused on identifying actual
species (metallic or otherwise) which occur at defined redox conditions.
Subsequent studies will be aimed at characterizing those factors which
affect the transport behavior of these species in MSBR systems. Although
previous data have indicated that these fission products were present as
reduced metals in the MSRE, the redox chemistry of those most susceptible
to oxidation (e.g., Nb and Mo) should be examined as a function of
y4t/u3t ratio and oxide ion concentration to verify these former conclu-
sions. This information will be useful in predicting the amount and
nature of these elements entering the fuel processing system.

Other fission products will be investigated for the purposes of evaluat-
ing alternate xenon-control schemes (such as hydrofluorination of I”) and
developing structural component decontamination procedures. Finally,

in view of new information, a re-examination of the MSRE data may prove
fruitful in predicting effects from parameter variations during MSBR
operations.

5.7.3 Funding

The operating fund requirements for this task group are given in Table
5.7.3.1, and the capital equipment fund requirements are given in Table
5.7.3.2.

5.7.4 Facilities

No new major facilities will be required for this task.

5.7.5 Task 4.4.1 Noble metal chemistry

It is essential that the understanding of noble-metal behavior be in-
creased to a level comparable to that of the other fission products.

A wealth of fundamental chemical property and thermodynamic data exists
for fission products other than the noble metals. For example, their
oxidation states have been characterized and can be accurately predicted
based on available free energies of formation both in solution and in
pure compounds. The noble metals can exist in several oxidation states

(cf. Ref. 93 for a description of possible valences and compounds for
nicbium halides) while often forming species with unusual chemical bonds
(e.g., metal-metal bonded complexes) but details concerning their sta-
bility are not available.

Realizing that the fission products are formed in the reactor as highly
charged species which must rapidly acquire electrons, it is plausible
that some of these oxidation states may play key roles in the behavior
of the noble fission products as they progress toward the metallic state.
Such reduction processes may determine the ultimate particle size and
distribution found in the reduced state and should be examined.

5.7.5.1 Subtask 4.4.1.1 Redox chemistry as a function of ut udt ratio

 

First in the study of the noble metal redox chemistry will be a determi-
nation of the possible oxidation states and the nature of the species
which these elements form in molten fluoride solution. Spectroscopic
and electrochemical techniques will be used, but will require concentra-
tions of fission products several orders of magnitude greater than those
anticipated in an MSBR. These studies would nevertheless identify

those states which might merit further study.

Having identified the stable soluble species of these fission products,
experiments involving equilibration of these species under controlled
redox potentials would be made to determine their thermodynamic stability.
Standard procedures involving HBF-H, gas mixtures or U*+H/U%* solutions
will be used and will be accompanied by electrochemical or spectrophoto-
metric monitoring of the soluble species.

The noble metals will be studied in order of importance based on their
susceptibility to oxidation, their fission yield and their neutron cross
sections. Because niobium is the most easily oxidized,! it will receive
the greatest attention. Molybdenum and the remaining noble metal fission
product elements will be studied as the work progresses.

It is presently known that niobium can exist in the 5+ and 4+ oxidation
states in fluoride solution.?*~97 When Nb*' is reduced still further

in solution, lower oxidation states have been indicated but have not
been well characterized. The 3+ and 2.5+ states are known in pure
halide compounds,??® and could possibly occur in fluoride solutions. The
results of Weaver et al.?6® have not, however, indicated any valences less
than 4+ in molten LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole 7%).

Molybdenum is known to exist in the 6+, 5+, 4+ and 3+ states,®® with
the 3+ state being identified in molten fluoride solutions.®® Lower
valences have not been reported in fluoride melts.

Solutions of Nb“** and Mo3t will be prepared and reduced by equilibration
with their respective metals and eventually with the other redox mixtures
mentioned above. Species of lower valence and with unusual bonding
5-66

properties will be sought to determine if they can occur as kinetically
unreactive intermediates. These experiments are expected to clarify
many of the mechanisms and rates which have been presumed to occur under
operating reactor conditions.

5.7.5.2 Subtask 4.4.1.2 Reactions with oxide ion =

 

The redox chemistry of noble metals in MSBR fuels may be complicated

by reactions involving trace concentrations of oxide. Oxide may cause ee
formation of oxyions and precipitation of sparingly soluble oxides in
which the valence of the metallic element is higher than would be stable
at the same UST/U" ratio in the absence of oxide. Hence, the amount

of noble metal that can enter solution as an ionic species or be con-
verted to a solid oxide depends on the oxide concentration as well as
the redox potential.

A recent study!90% has revealed that Nbot forms the very stable oxyion

Kb0,t in molten fluorides, rendering the pentavalent state more stable

in solution and the oxide Nb,0O; more scluble than would otherwise be the F
case, The object of this subtask is to conduct similar studies of the

chemistry of molybdenum and ruthenium in molten fluorides in order to

define the behavior of these noble-metal fission products in an MSBR

fuel.

In the absence of oxide, molybdenum apparently!0! can be oxidized from

the metal to the trivalent state in molten fluorides at a redox potential

intermediate between that required to oxidize Fel to Fe?t and Ni to

NiZ*. In the presence of oxide, oxidation should lead to the formation

of very insoluble MoO,; however, from available formation free energies, wi
the reaction

 Mo(e) + 7 U0z(e) + 2 UF, (d) = UF3(d) + 7 M00; (c) .

should not proceed until the U3t/U%t ratio falls to <107°. Yet, the

Mo*t ion is smaller than Zr'*t ion (0.69 vs 0.79 A), which has a slight GE
tendency to form an oxyion. Formation of an oxyion of Mot sufficiently

stable to persist at the low oxide concentration of an MSBR fuel is a

distinct possibility that should be investigated. Gi

A similar study would be undertaken for ruthenium which is expected to
be more noble than molybdenum. The fluoride formed on oxidation of the
metal is expected to be RuF3, while the stable oxide is probably RuO,,
though its formation by a reaction analogous to the one above for molyb-
denum should occur at much lower yt ght ratios (v1079) The ion size
of Rut is somewhat smaller than Mo“t; hence, oxyions in solution are ss
again a possibility.

5.7.5.3 Subtask 4.4.1.3 Reactions with graphite

Molybdenum can form Mo,C and MoC at MSBR operating temperatures. The
free energies of formation of these compounds become negative at 450°C
and the compounds become more stable at increasing temperatures. 02
Niobium likewise forms two carbides Nb,C and NbC103 with negative free
energies of formation (<-20 kcal/mole) and would be stable at MSBR oper-
ating temperatures. Nothing appears to be known concerning the carbides
of technetium, but it seems certain that no carbide formation is expected
from the platinum metals, Ag, Te, Cd, Sb, and Sn.!

Experiments will be conducted with dilute solutions of potential carbon-
seeking fission products in graphite containers under various redox
conditions. It will be determined whether carbide formation does occur
and what factors govern it at typical MSBR operating conditions. Identi-
fication of the carbide phases will be made by x-ray analysis and the
soluble (partially oxidized) species giving rise to the carbides will

be followed by electrochemical and/or spectrophotometric means.

5.7.5.4 Subtask 4.4.1.4 Noble-metal agglomeration and deposition

The noble metals, molybdenum, ruthenium, etc., are formed atomically in
the fuel of a molten-salt reactor. Consequently, their fate in the
reactor depends on the kinetics of their agglomeration and deposition.
These phenomena are in turn expected to be dependent on the flow rates

of the liquid, the chemical environment of the atoms, their diffusivities,
and nature of the surfaces available for deposition.

The objective of this subtask is to define the significant parameters
which would permit estimates to be made of the fates of the noble-metal
elements.

The experimental approach to be followed initially will use nonradio-
active materials and would make use of the high sensitivity (v10!¢ atoms)
of Auger analysis. Exploding wire methods and chemical decompositions
would be attempted to prepare fine dispersions in flowing molten salt.
The deposition of these materials onto graphite and metals would be
characterized. Subsequent experiments would use tracer methods and in-
pile fission experiments to correlate the earlier results and to develop
a basis for the monitoring methods required for a reactor. During the
deposition studies, attempts to study agglomeration rates would be made
under conditions of very low flow rates.

5.7.5.5 Subtask 4.4.1.5 Distribution of noble metals between molten
salt and He

The use of techniques developed under Subtask 4.4.1.4 would be extended
to conditions of high flow in the presence of a dispersion of helium.
Both the agglomeration rate and the deposition process are expected to
vary from the patterns observed in the absence of helium. The helium
5-68

would be removed from the salt into a flowing gas stream of additional
helium which would be conducted into a deposition region in which the
gas with entrained noble metals would move with variable velocity across
test specimens or through filters. Auger analysis would be used to
characterize the deposits.

The size of the helium bubbles would be a strong variable in this study
and would be the principal independent variable in the work of this sub-
task. If adequate correlation is developed under Subtask 4.4.1.4 between
out—of-pile and in-pile depositicn in the absence of helium, in-pile
studies under the present subtask would not be required.

5.7.6 Task 4.4.2 Iodine distribution

 

The behavior of iodine and its removal from molten mixtures of LiF-BeF»
has been studied because of its relevance to the problem of 135%e removal
from MSBRs and to the containment necessary during maintenance operations.
It has been considered that, under the normal operating conditions of a
—s ~ 0. odd . : ;
moliten-salt reactor Eur, Xp, 0.01), iodine is present in solution

in its most reduced state, i.e., as I . Thus, its removal from molten
fluoride solution has been studied by means of transpiration experiments
using HF-H, mixtures as the sparging gas. Although the reaction studied

I + HF(g) = HI(g) + F

is metathetical, hydrogen was present to prevent corrosion of the metallic
container and to suppress dissociation of the HI. The data obtained
indicated that quantitative removal of HI, and thus of a significant
fraction of Xe, can be accomplished and that the rate-controlling step
of the reaction is the transport of IT from the bulk of the melt to the
surface.”’%s10% Since the concentration of 13%I in an MSBR has been
estimated to be about 20,000 times lower than in the laboratory experi-
ments and since MSBR fuel is a more complex redox system than the
solvent studied, additional research is required in order to test many
of the assumptions and calculations made and to further evaluate this
method for removing icdine from the reactor. Control of 135%e poisoning
in an MSBR via iodine removal would require the simultaneous removal of
135%e since the direct fission yield of 13°Xe is 18%.

5.7.7 Task 4.4.3 Decontamination of Hastelloy N

The maintenance of some parts of an MSBR may necessitate the decontami-
nation of moderately contaminated equipment. It is anticipated that
surface decontamination of Hastelloy N will not be appreciably different
than other metals for which there is a long history of experience.
Experiments to investigate decontamination will be carried out to
define practical operating procedures.

5.7.8 Task 4.4.4 Analysis of fission product deposition data from MSRE

The experience with the MSRE showed that the noble gases and stable
fluorides behaved as expected based on their chemistry. The noble metal
behavior and fates, 105 however, are still in part a matter of conjecture.
Except for niobium under unusual oxidizing conditions, it seems clear
that these elements are present as metals and that their ubiquitous prop-
erties stem from the fact that the metals are not wetted by, and have
extremely low solubilities in, MSR fuels. Unfortunately, the MSRE obser-
vations probably were substantially affected by the spray system, oil
cracking products, and flow to and from the overflow, all of which were
continuously changing, uncontrolled variables. The low material balance
on 1311 indicates appreciable undetermined loss from the MSRE, probably
as a noble metal precursor (Te, Sb).

Table 5.3.3.4 shows the estimated distribution of the various fission
products in a molten-salt reactor based on the MSRE studies. Unfortunately,
the wide variance and poor material balances for the noble metal data make
it unrealistic to specify their fates more than qualitatively. As a
consequence, future reactor designs must allow for encountering appre-
ciable fractions of the noble metals in a number of regions of the

reactor. As indicated in the table, continuous chemical processing

and the processes finally chosen will substantially affect the fates of
many of the fission products.

5.7.9 Task 4.4.5 Studies in the Gas-System Technology Facility (GSTF)

Noble metal behavior in the MSRE was most difficult to determine and,
therefore, will be difficult to predict in an MSBR. The noble metals
are born as atomic fission products and are insoluble in the fuel salt.
The atomic~size particles are not wet by the fuel salt and tend to
agglomerate, presumably as a dust or scum on the salt surface and as

a deposit on the Hastelloy N surfaces. It may be possible to design
experiments utilizing the Gas-System Technology Facility (GSTF)196 to
investigate metal mist distribution between the salt and gas stream

as a function of time, salt flow rate, temperature, and stripper gas
void volume. The metal mist could possibly be generated by exploding-
wire techniques to simulate formation of the atomic-size fission
products.

5.8 TASK GROUP 4.5 FUNDAMENTAL STUDIES OF MOLTEN SALTS

5.8.1 Objective

Any chemical reaction that is thermodynamically favored can be expected
to occur in an MSBR fuel environment. Kinetic barriers seldom prevent
such favored reactions from proceeding. As a consequence, thermodynamic
data for MSBR-related molten fluoride mixtures provide an extremely use-
ful means for predicting the extent of chemical reactions in such systems
and the accumulation of thermochemical data for actinide, fission product,
and structural metal fluorides from the measurement of selected chemical
equilibria has been an important part of the basic chemical development
effort which has supported the MSBR pregram at ORNL. "9751 The objective
of this task group is to accumulate formation free energies and activity
coefficient values for all important substances present in the fuel

with sufficient accuracy to define the course of all relevant chemical
reactions over the ranges of temperature and salt composition that can
cccur in an MSBR., Because of the transcendent nature of thermodynamics,
it is possible to achieve this ambitious goal through continued judicious
choices of chemical equilibria for measurement.

Parts per million concentrations of various chemical species (e.g., oxygen,
tellurium, bismuth) can profoundly affect molten salt reactor systems.
Porous electrodes have provided an excellent means of monitoring and
eliminating similar low-level impurities in aqueous systems and work

will be directed at developing techniques and equipment for use in

molten salts.

5.8.5 Task 4.5.1 Formation-free energy and activity coefficient

Measurements will first be made of the following equilibrium in LiF - i

ThO, (c) + 2NiF,(d) = ThF,(d) + 2Nio(c) (1) ss

Q = K1 Yip, Yopr,

Here Ky is the equilibrium constant, defined equal to Q in LijBeF,. From

well known, as is that for NiF; in Li,BeF, [AGyir, (a)! Hence, an

improved value of the formation-free energy of ThFy in Li,BeFy can be
cbtained from AGj.

 

The activity coefficient of NiF, in the fuel mixture will be derived
from a measurement of the solubility of NiF,,

NiF,(c) = NiF,(d)
where K;, the solubility in Li,BeFy, is

From YNiF, and the quotient YNiF, YThF, » obtained from Q; in the same
5-73
LiF-BeF,—-ThF, salt mixture, the activity coefficient of ThF, in this
fuel salt mixture can then be obtained.

In subsequent studies, other equilibria of the following general type
will be measured

Here the valence of the metal M in the fluoride (x) can be less than

or equal to that in the metal oxide (y). The MFx - MO, /, combinations
that will be considered for study include: UFy-UO,; ZYFy—2r0,; TiF3-TiO;;
FeF,-Fey03; CrFy ~ Cry03. From the corresponding equilibrium quotients

_ x/2 _ x/2
Qs = *ur / ir "Ks ar, Mr

the formation free energy To and the activity coefficient Vp of the

metal fluoride may be derived.

As data on activity coefficients effects are accumulated, it is planned
to improve the correlation of these with melt composition, cation size,
and cation charge. The goal is to computerize this information, along
with an updated tabulation of formation free energies, in a form con-
venient for those who wish to estimate the various chemical equilibria
in MSBR fuels.

5.8.6 Task 4.5.2 Porous electrode studies

Monitoring and/or removal of low concentration species such as 0, Te, and
Bi in molten salt fuels is essential to the satisfactory and safe
operation of molten-salt breeder reactors. Initial investigation of the
possible use of porous electrodes in molten-salt fuels are directed at
identification of materials and design of a suitable cell gnd auxiliary
equipment for conducting investigations in fluoride melts. This equip-
ment will be used to investigate the problem of monitoring and/or

removal of bismuth from the return stream from the chemical processing
operations. 107 Data to be obtained include total current requirement,
Faradaic efficiency, and potential drop through the porous or packed-bed
electrode as a function of electrode potential, salt flow rate, temperature,
and the concentration and identity of the bismuth species. This informa-
tion will allow the establishment of the feasibility of using a porous
electrode as a bismuth monitor or as a device for efficient removal of
bismuth from a flowing MSBR salt stream.

6. ANALYTICAL RESEARCE AND DEVELOPMENT

6.1 INTRODUCTION

6.1.1 Objective

Analytical research and development activities will be directed toward
providing the chemical devices and methods for the analyses required to
achieve a safe and efficient molten-salt breeder reactor. To this end
the highest priority will be assigned to demonstration of the feasibility
of in-line methods for constituents or properties of reactor streams

that are deemed essential for power reactor operation. Essential deter-
minations will include the redox condition of the fuel, total uranium
concentration in the fuel, oxide and bismuth contamination, corrosion
indicators in the fuel and coolant, and measurements of tritium distribu-
tion throughout the system. Because of the importance of such determi-
nations, a diversity of approaches will be investigated. A similar
redundancy may ultimately be employed in operating reactors to provide
"back-up" measurements for essential determinations.

A second important objective is that of developing the analytical devices
and methods required by the Program to conduct meaningful studies and
experiments on technology development in diverse areas including develop~
ment of materials for the reactor primary circuit, fuel processing, and
the distribution and containment of tritium. Such developments will,

as far as possible, be timed to coincide with the needs of the Program
and may in many cases precede the design of perfected transducers for
reactor application. Experience in this and other reactor technology
programs has generally demonstrated the value of in-line methods both

in more economical analyses and in more timely and frequently more mean-
ingful results. The nature of MSBR salt streams (sensitivity of samples
to atmospheric contamination, equilibrium shifts on cooling, and impor-
tance of oxidation state of constituents) further enhances the value of
in situ analysis. Therefore, the analytical research and development
program will be directed largely tc the development of in-line or in situ
methods. Development of methods for the analysis of discrete salt
samples will be considered individually as the need arises.

 

This development activity will generate a diversity of in-line analytical
techniques many of which will not be employed in an operating reactor.

A continucus evaluation will be made to identify those in-line techniques
that would provide the most valuable data and to develop as many as are
technically feasible in order that they can be incorporated into develop-
ment systems as well as test and demonstration reactors. In the final
application of analytical devices to power reactors, the number of
analytical transducers would be reduced to a more modest level that
includes only those essential to safe operation and those which have

been demonstrated to contribute to an economically justifiable increase
in plant efficiency.

6.1.2 Scope
The scope of this activity includes the following areas of methodology: a
In-line Electrochemical Analyses (Task Group 5.1)
Application of Spectrophotometric Methods (Task Group 5.2) a
Analyses by Chemical Methods (Task Group 5.3)
Analysis of Gas Streams (Task Group 5.4) ws
Detection of Fission Products and Pa by Gamma Spectrometry (Task
Group 5.5)
In-line Analytical Test Facility (Task Group 5.6) =
Special Studies (Task Group 5.7)
Each of these task groups is expected to contribute analysis methods
applicable to the three functional subdivisions of the reactor: the
fuel system, the reprocessing system and the coolant system. The last we
task group, Special Studies, incorporates a variety of activities in-
cluding the investigation of advanced approaches to which only cursory
study has yet been given; the simultaneous use of two or more of the Si
first six techniques; the exploitation of technological breakthroughs; =
the application, with automation where practical, of fully developed in-
line or in situ methods in support of other Program activities; and the
evaluation of the various methods in terms of final reactor requirements. EE

6.3 REQUIREMEKTS, EXPERIENCE, AND STATUS OF DEVELOPMENT
6.3.1 Requirements a

In order to exploit fully the unique features of the MSR concept and
ensure safe and efficient reactor operation, it will be necessary to Gi
maintain adequate surveillance of the composition of various reactor
streams. Ideally, all such analyses would be performed automatically
=]

6-3

with transducers located in the salt streams, since analysis of discrete
samples in hot cells is subject to unavoidable delays and is expensive.

At present, it appears that it may not be practical to measure major
fuel constituents such as Li, Be, Th, and fluoride, by in-line methods
in an MSBR. Fortunately, continuous monitoring of these constituents
will not be critical to the operation of a reactor. The more critical
determinations, on the other hand, are generally amenable to in-line
measurement. Determinations which appear to be of most significance
include the redox condition of the fuel,” corrosion product ions (partic-
ularly cr?t), oxide, bismuth, hydrogen and tritium, certain fission
products, and protactinium in fluoride streams. The accurate determina-
tion of total uranium concentration (with an accuracy of about 1 part in
10%) in the fuel salt would also be quite useful in the calculation of
long-term reactivity balances. Determinations for some materials will
be required in the chloride streams of the fuel processing system. Simi-
larly, methods will be required to monitor corrosion products in the
coolant salt together with free and combined hydrogen and tritium, oxy-
genated species and any redox buffer couple which may be incorporated
into the coolant salt. In-line analyses for permanent gas contaminants,
moisture, tritium, hydrocarbon, and fission product gases will be needed
in the fuel cover gas. To this must be added BF3, HF, hydrogen, and
hydrolysis products in the coolant cover gas (or analogous constituents
if an alternate coolant is selected), and perhaps HF, F», and UFg in
gaseous streams from the processing system.

It should be noted that in addition to economics of time and expense, the
in-line techniques will provide information not attainable by discrete
sampling methods. A notable example is the udt/u"t ratio in the fuel.
This ratio is prohibitively sensitive to atmospheric contamination during
sampling and sample transfer in hot cells, and is rather meaningless on
frozen samples because the ratio undergoes changes during cooling as a
result of shifts in equilibrium. Another example is the determination

of trace constituents in gases, which is notoriously difficult if not
impossible to effect by withdrawing samples.

It is evident that the ultimate need for an MSBR is an analytical system
that includes all needed in-line analytical measurements that are feasible,
backed up by adequate hot cell and analytical laboratories. In the interim
period it is also necessary to develop capabilities and to provide ama-
lytical support for the technology development activities in the Program.

*
The U3t/U*t ratio is a measure of the redox potential of the fuel which

influences the rate of corrosion and the distribution of certain fission
products and tritium in the reactor system.

6.3.2 Experience

The major development of analytical methods for discrete samples was
associated with the operation of the MSRE. The analytical methods for
this reactor were developed to support the objectives of the chemical
surveillance program.! With the exception of in-line analyses of the
off-gas and remote gamma spectrometry (described later in this section),
all analyses were performed on batch samples either in hot cells or by

bench-top methods.

Prior to the MSRE program, substantial experience was gained in the
handling and analysis of nonradioactive fluoride salts in the ANP Program.
Ionic or instrumental methods had been developed for most metallic con-
stituents, and methods were available for F  (pyrohydrolysis)? and
sulfur.3 For MSRE application, it was necessary to adapt these methods

to hot-cell operations. A technique involving the evolution of elemental
oxygen by reaction with BrF; has since resulted in the versatile KBrFy, Es
method” (for oxide in inorganic samples. A non-selective measurement of

"reducing power" of adequate sensitivity had been developed (hydrogen

evolution method).® A general expertise® in the radiochemical separation a
and measurement of fission products was available from earlier reactor
programs at ORNL, and useful experience with in-line gas analysis,
particularly process chromatograph,’ was available from other programs.
During the operation of the MSRE and in the subsequent technology pro-

gram, development of methods for discrete samples was continued, and the

Laboratory acquired instrumentation for newer analytical techniques. EE
Instrumental methods which have or are expected to contribute to the

program include: x-ray absorption, diffraction, and fluorescence tech-

niques; NMR; spark source mass spectrometry; ESCA and Auger spectrometry; i
electron microprobe measurements; scanning electron microscopy; Raman

spectrometry; Fourier transform spectrometry; neutron activation analysis;

delayed neutron methods; photon activation analysis; and scanning with

high-energy particles, e.g. protons. The detailed description of all

analytical methods available to the program is beyond the scope of this

discussion. Tabulation of analytical capabilities at ORNL and within

the Oak Ridge complex are reported elsewhere.® Certain developments Es
merit additional mention and are discussed below.

6.3.2.1 Sampling

The preparation of homogenized samples of MSRE fuel for elemental analyses

presented problems because of the radioactivity and the hydroscopic nature ws
of the salt.” Salt samples were taken in small copper ladles which were

sealed under helium in a transport container in the sampler-enricher!®

for delivery to the hot cell. There the ladle was unloaded and sectioned. Es
The salt was removed from the truncated ladle and homogenized by vigorous
shaking in a pulverizer vessel. Salt transfer was then made to a poly-
ethylene vial threaded in the bottom of the pulverizing vessel with
minimal atmospheric exposure. This procedure provided a free-flowing
 

 

6-9

powdered sample within two hours of receipt of the ladle. Atmospheric
exposure was sufficient tc compromise the determination of oxide and
ust, but did not affect other measurements.

6.3.2.2 Oxide

Because of the sensitivity of the pulverized salt to unavoidable atmo-
spheric contamination, transpiration techniques in which the entire
sample could be analyzed were adopted. For the more critical determina-
tions, the most successful application of transpiration techniques was
the determination of oxide by hydrofluorination.}! The method is based
on the evolution of water which occurs when melts are sparged with mix-
tures of anhydrous HF and hydrogen. By removing surface moisture with

a premelting hydrofluorination step and by measuring the water evolved
from 50-g samples as an integrated signal from an electrolytic moisture
monitor, oxide concentrations of about 50 ppm were measured with precision
better than +10 ppm.

6.3.2.3 Uranium

Analyses for uranium by coulometric titrationl? showed good reproduc-
ibility and high precision (0.5%), but on-line reactivity balance cal-
culations were about 10-fold more sensitive than this in establishing
changes in uranium concentrations within the MSRE fuel salt circuit.
Reactivity balance in an MSBR may be less useful, however, because of
uncertainties introduced by continuous processing of the fuel salt. It
was demonstrated that uranium from the fluorination of 50-g samples of
melten fuel could be quantitatively collected as decontaminated UFg. The
technique was used primarily to separate uranium for precise isotopic
analysis, but sufficient work was done to establish its potential for
more accurate uranium determination by measurement of the separated
uranium outside the hot cell.

6.3.2.4 us’

A hydrogenation-transpiration method was developed for the determination
of U3t in fuel salt.!3 The rate of production of HF from the sparging of
fuel with hydrogen is a function of the instantaneous ratio of USt/utt,

A computer program was developed to compute yields of HF from the reduc-
tion of UFy and corrosion product fluorides as a function of composition
and reduction conditions and thus permit estimation of UST concentrations
from the integrated HF yields from sequential reduction steps at two
temperatures. Results of such measurements were in reasonable agreement
with "book values" computed from reactor charging and operating data
during 235y operation. * The method proved inadequate for use with the
lower concentrations of uranium in the 233y fuel.
6-10

A voltammetric method was tested for the measurement of UST/U"F ratios
in remelted fuel samples?!® {see section on Electrochemical Research for
a description of voltammetry). Measurements were performed with elec-
trodes inserted in samples remelted in their ladles. More atmospheric
exposure was incurred than in the oxide determination, because it was
necessary to cut off the top of the ladles to accommodate the electrodes.
Accordingly, ratios below those expected were obtained. However, normally
shaped reduction waves for Crt and U* were recorded, and the reduction
of the fuel by hydrogen sparging was followed voltammetrically. Changes
in ratio with temperature were consistent with thermodynamic predictions
of equilibrium shifts between the uranium couple and corrosion product
ions. This indicated that the radiation level of the samples had negli-
gible effects on the method and supports the potential of voltammetry

for application to reactor salt streams.

6.3.2.5 Spectrophotometry of radioactive samples

 

A facility was constructed!® which permitted measurements with highly
radioactive samples within a hot cell by using the components of a
spectrophotometer located cutside the cell. A system of extended opcics
directed the chopped reference and sample beams through the cell walls,
focused the sample beam at the center of an optical furnace and returned
the two beams through the wall to the monochromator-—detector section of
the instrument. The system design included devices for remelting large
salt samples under inert atmosphere and dispensing portions to spectro-
photometric cells, but because of the pending shutdown of the MSRE, a
sample system was devised to fill windowless cells by direct immersion
in the fuel. Despite precautions tec prevent atmospheric exposure, the
UH in the samples was completely oxidized before measurements could be
made. The spectrum of Ut was recorded, however, as was that of ust
(following a reduction with uranium metal). Comparison of the spectra
of these samples with those of nonradicactive preparations indicated no
adverse effects from the activity of the fuel and demonstrated the
feasibility of the technique. The facility has since been used to measure
the spectra of transuranium elements and protactinium in molten salts.

6.3.2.6 Gas amalysis

Equipment was installed at the MSRE to perform limited in-line analyses

of the reactor off-gases, using a thermal conductivity cell as a trans-
ducer. By means of an oxidation and absorption train!” both total
impurities and hydrocarbons were measured in the off-gas. The sampling
station also included a system for the cryogenic collection of xenon

and krypton on molecular sieves to provide concentrated samples for

the precise determination of the isotopic ratios of krypton and Xenon

by mass spectrometry. During the last two runs of the MSRE, equipment !8
was installed at the reactor to convert the tritium in various gas streams
to water for measurement by scintillation counting.

 
 

 

 

6-11

6.3.2.7 Gamma spectrometry at the MSRE

 

By means of a precise collimation system mounted on a maintenance shield,
radiation from fission products deposited on reactor components was de-
tected by a high-resolution lithium~drifted germanium diode.!? From

the gamma spectra obtained, specific isotopes such as noble metal fission
products were identified and their distribution was mapped by moving the
collimating system.?? During the latter runs of the reactor such measure-
ments were made during power operation.?

6.3.2.8 Bismuth

Processing of the fuel salt by selective extraction into liquid bismuth
(described in Section 3) required the development of more sensitive
methods for the determination of bismuth in fuel salt. An inverse
polarographic technique was developed which has detection limits of
about 50 ppb .2! The bismuth is deposited on a pendent mercury drop
electrode from HCl solutions in which copper is masked with thiocyanate,
and measured during an anodic scan. A spectrographic method of at least
equivalent sensitivity was also developed; however, it incorporates a
preconcentration by extraction with dithizone and requires large salt
samples.

6.3.3 Status of development

 

Research and/or development studies in the area of analytical chemistry
have been carried out in all of the areas outlined in the scope of this
activity. Presently, investigations are being continued along lines that
emphasize support of technology development within the Program. Because
electrochemical methods have proven most successful at this stage of
development for in-line measurement, current work is concentrated largely
in this area. The status of earlier work on this activity is summarized
below.

6.3.3.1 Electrochemical research

 

For the analysis of molten~salt streams, electroanalytical techniques
such as voltammetry and potentiometry appear to offer the most convenient
transducers for remote in-line measurements. Voltammetry is based on the
principle that when an inert electrode is inserted into a molten salt

and subjected to a changing voltage relative to the salt potential, neg-
ligible current will flow until a critical potential is reached at which
one or more of the ions undergoes an electrochemical reduction or oxida-
tion. The potential at which this reaction takes place is characteristic
of the particular ion or ions. If the potential is varied linearly with
time, the resulting current-voltage curve follows a predictable pattern
in which the current reaches a diffusion-limited maximum value that is
directly proportional to the concentration of the electroactive ion or
ions.
6-12

Basic voltammetric studies have been made on corrosion product ioms in

the MSRE fuel solvent, LiF~BeF,~ZrF, 22725 and in the proposed coolant

salt, NaBF,-NaF.2%"26 Most of this work is concerned with the deter-
mination of oxidation states of the elements, the most suitable electrode
materials for their analysis, and the basic electrochemical characteristics
of each element. It has been shown that relatively high concentrations

(typically, 20 ppm) can be estimated directly from the height of the
voltammetric waves. Lower concentrations can be measured using the

technique of stripping voltammetry through observation of the current

produced when a corrosion product is oxidized from an electrode on which wi
it has previcusly been plated.” Only limited studies of the stripping

technique have been made in molten fluoride salts.

A voltammetric method has been developed for the determination of pdt ust
ratio in the MSRE fuel.!5 This method involves the measurement of the
potential difference between the equilibrium potential of the melt,
measured by a noble electrode, and the voltammetric equivalent of the a
standard potential of the Uy3tjutt couple. The reliability of the method

was verified by comparison with values that were obtained spectrophoto-

metrically.?® This determination has been completely automated with wi
a PDP-8 computers? which operates the voltammeter, analyzes the data,

and computes the USH/U*T ratio. Recently, the method was used to deter-
mine U3Y/u%t ratios in a thorium bearing fuel solvent, LiF-BeF,-ThF,
(60-20-12 mole %). Ratios covering the range of 107° to >1072 were
measured during the reduction of the fuel in a forced~convection loop
(FCL-2b}. The data, not yet completely analyzed, support the reliability
of the method in this medium.

Because the fuel processing operation3? presents the possibility for

introducing bismuth into the fuel, a method for bismuth determination wa
is required, The reductive behavior of Bi3* was characterized in LiF-
BeF,-ZrF, 2° and it was found that it is rather easily reduced to the
metal. As an impurity in the fuel salt, bismuth will probably be present
in the metallic state, so that some oxidative pretreatment of the melt
will be necessary before a voltammetric determination of bismuth can be
performed.

The measurement of the concentration of protonated species in the pro-
posed MSBR coolant salt is of interest because of the potential use of
the coolant for the containment of tritium. The measurement could also i
be used to evaluate the effect of proton concentrations on corrosion

rates and as a possible detection technique for steam generator leaks.

A rather unique electroanalytical technique that is specific for hydrogen

was investigated.2%s3! The method is based on the diffusion of hydrogen we
into an evacuated palladium-tube electrode when NaBF, melts are electro-

lyzed at a controlled potential. The pressure generated in the electrode

is a2 sensitive measure of protons at ppb concentrations. The technique a
offers the advantages of specificity, applicability to in-line analysis,

and the possibility of a measurement of tritium-to-hydrogen ratios in

the coolant by counting the sample collected from the evacuated tube. .
Measurements by this technique, together with observations in other areas
Ga

 

6-13

of analytical research, has led to the discovery that at least two forms
of combined hydrogen are present in NaBF, melts. In addition to in-
frared-active BF30H, which is not easily reduced, a more labile electro-
active species is present in equilibrium with a condensible species in
the gas phase. In all electreanalytical measurements it is a distinct
advantage to have an invariant reference potential to which other elec-
trochemical reactions may be referred on a relative potential scale. A
practical reference electrode must be fairly rugged and of unit construc-
tion. The major problem was to find non-conducting materials which would
be compatible with fluoride melts. Successful measurements were performed
with a Ni/NiF, electrode, in which the reference solution (LiF-BeF,
saturated with NiF,) is contained within a single-crystal LaF; cup.32,33
Standard electrode potentials were determined for several metal/metal-ion
couples which will be present in the reactor salt streams.?® These
electrode potentials provide a direct measure of the relative thermody-
namic stability of electroactive species in the melts. This information
can be used in equilibrium calculations to determine which ions would be
expected to be present at different melt potentials.

6.3.3.2 Spectrophotometric research

 

Because molten fluorides react with the usually employed light transmit-
ting glasses, special cell designs have been developed for the spectre-
photometric examination of MSBR melts. The pendent-drop technique3® that
was first developed was later replaced with the captive-liquid cel113% in
which molten salts are contained by virtue of their surface tension, so
that no window material is required. A concept has been proposed for

the use of this cell in an in-line system. 36 Although the light path
length through a salt in a captive-liquid cell is determinable, it is

not fixed. The need for a fixed path length promoted the design and
fabrication of a graphite cell having small diamond-plate windows37 which
has been used successfully in a number of research applications. Another
fixed-path~-length cell which is still in the development stage makes use
of a porous metal foil3® that contains a number of small irregular pits
formed electrochemically; many of the pits are etched completely through
the foil, so that light can be transmitted through the metal. Porous
metal made from Hastelloy N has been purchased to test its use for cell
construction.

The latest innovation in cell design is an optical probe which lends
itself to a sealable insertion into a molten salt stream.3% The probe
makes use of multiple internal reflections within a slot of appropriate
width cut through some portion of the internally reflected light beam.3?
During measurements the slot would be below the surface of the molten
salt and would provide a known path length for absorbance measurements.
It is believed that the probe could be made of LaFj; for measurements in
NaBF, streams.

Spectrophotometric studies of uranium in the +3 oxidation state have
shown that this method is a likely candidate for in-line determination
of Ut in the reactor fuel.*0s%1 An extremely sensitive adsorption peak
6-14

for U"t (42) may be useful for monitoring residual uranium in depleted
processing streams. Quantitative characterizations, including absorption
peak positions, peak intensities, and the assignment of spectra, have

been made for Nit, Fe2¥, cr?t, crt, ust, wo,2t, cu?t, Mn?t, Mud, cot, wa
Mo3*, ¢ro,2-, Pa bt pust, pr3t Na3t, su3t, Erdt, and Ho3t., Semiquanti-

tative characterizations, including beorpiion peak positions, approximate

peak intensities, and possible ass Jgnment of spectra, have also been made =
for Ti 3+ yet , y3t, Eu 2%, sm?t, ¢ , and Gy,”

Investigation of protonated species in the proposed coolant were made.
Evidence for the existence of hydrogen-containing impurities in NaBF,
was first obtained from near-infrared spectra of the molten salt and in
mid-infrared spectra of pressed pellets of the crystalline material “3

In deterium exchange experiments attempted in fluoroborate melts, two
sensitive absorption peaks corresponding to BF30H and BF30D” were iden-
tified. There was no evidence that deuterium would exchange with BF30H ,
rather, BF30D™ was generated via a redox reaction with impurities in the fi
melt."* The absorption spectra of several other species have been ob-
served in fluorcborate melts.*® Work on spectrophotometric methods is
also providing data for the identification and determination of sclute
species in the various melts of interest for the fuel salt processing
system.?

 

6.3.3.3 Transpiration and gas analysis

 

Although the transpiration approach offers the advantage of locating a
transducers for effluent gas analysis outside the highest radiation
zones, these devices will still receive exposure from fission-product
gases and their daughters and possibly from particulate radioactive mate-
rials, and thus they will require remote operation. The only research
performed on such transducers has been on methods for batch samples of
the MSRE fuel. The electrolytic moisture monitor was demonstrated to

provide more than adequate sensitivity for the measurement of water from wi
the hydrofliuorination method for oxide and to have adequate tolerance

for operation at the anticipated radiation levels.®® A method has been

developed for the remote measurement of micromolar quantities of HF a
generated by hydrogenation of fuel samples using a Jthermal- —conductivity

method after preconcentration by trapping on NaF.%

 

Commercial gas chromatographic components for high-sensitivity measurement
of permanent gas contaminants are not expected to be acceptable at the
radiation levels of the MSBR off-gas. Valves contain elastomers which

are subject to radiation damage and whose radiolysis products would a
contaminate the carrier gas. The more sensitive detectors generally

depend on ionization by weak radiation sources and would obviously be

affected by sample activity. A prototype of an all-metal sampling valve'*8 Li
has been constructed to effect 6-way, double-throw switching of gas
streams with closure effected by a pressure-actuated metal diaphragm. A
helium breakdown detector was found to be capable of measuring sub-ppm
concentrations of permanent gas impurities in helium. Use of this de-
tector in a simple chromatograph on the purge gas of an in-pile capsule

 
 

 

6-15

test (MTR-47-6) demonstrated that it was not affected by radioactivity.*?
Ironically, subsequent tests with a more highly purified carrier gas
revealed sporadically noisy operation caused by unstable discharges.8
Tests to circumvent this difficulty by controlled impurity additions were
suspended because of higher priority problems.

The analysis of the coolant cover gas involves less radicactivity but
more complex chemical problems. Methods are being investigated for the
determination of condensable material tentatively identified as BFj
hydrates and hydrolysis products’? and for other forms of hydrogen

and tritium. 'Dew-point' and diffusion methods offer promise for such
measurements .”! An improved Karl Fischer coulometric titrator was de-
veloped to provide calibration measurements of ''water" in both simulated
and actual cover gas samples.

6.3.3.4 In-line applications

 

The first successful chemical analysis of a flowing molten fluoride salt
stream®? was demonstrated by measuring u3t/u ratios in a loop being
operated to determine the effect of salt on Hastelloy N under both oxi-
dizing and reducing conditions. The test facility was a Hastelloy N
thermal-convection loop (NCL-21) in which LiF-BeF,~ZrF,~-UF, circulated

at about five linear feet per minute. The analytical transducers were
platinum and iridium electrodes that were installed in a surge tank where
the temperature was controlled at 650°C,

The pdt/ust ratio was monitored over a period of several months on a
completely automated basis. A new cyclic voltammeter, which provides
several new capabilities for electrochemical studies on molten-salt
systems, was designed for use with this system. The voltammeter can be
directly operated by a PDP-8 type computer.>3 A PDP~-8I computer was used
to control the analysis system, analyze the experimental output, make
the necessary calculations, and print out the results. As equilibrium
conditions were being established, increases in the U3* concentration
were followed as chromium was slowly dissolved from the Hastelloy N,
causing U*t to be reduced. Precipitous drops in the U3 concentrations
were observed due to the introduction of oxidizing contaminants when
metal specimens were inserted into the melt."

In-line measurements of udtyht ratios and crt concentrations are now
being made in fuel salt in a forced-convection loop (FCL-2b). Severe
vibration problems distort the waves and reduce the accuracy of the
measurements when the fuel is pumped at high velocity, but excellent
voltammograms are obtained when the pump is stopped. A special shielded
electrode assembly is being fabricated to reduce the effect of vibrations
in this and similar locations.

Provisions have been made in the design of the two engineering loops, the
Coolant-Salt Technology Facility {CSTF) and the Gas-System Technology
Facility (GSTF), for the installation of analytical transducers. In
6-16

brief studies in the CSTF, reduction waves for Fe3t, Felt, cr?t and
possibly Mo3t were observed at concentrations from 20 to 100 ppm. First
order decay of active protons was cbserved te concentrations as low as

a few ppb.

6.4 TASK GROUP 5.1 IN-LINE ELECTROCHEMICAL METHODS

6.4.1 Objective

The objective of Task Group 5.1 is to develop electroanalytical methods
for the analysis of fuel, coolant and processing salt streams of test,
demonstration, and power reactors on a schedule that will permit the use
of such methods in support of technology development activities for the
MSBR program. Experience has shown that certain electroanalytical methods,
voltammetry and perhaps potentiometry, offer the most convenient trans-
ducers for in-line installation. Therefore, such methods are expected

to receive the most usage — at least early in the development program.

The development of practical in-line methods must be preceded by the
generation ¢f basic data, such as standard electrode potentials, diffusion
coefficients, conditions of reversibility, etc. by using other electro-
chemical techniques as chronopotentiometry, and coulometry. These basic
studies will alse provide valuable data on the behavior of ions in melts.

6.4.2 Schedule

The schedule for work in this task group is shown in Table 6.4.2.

6.4.3 Funding

Operating fund requirements for this task group are shown in Table 6.4.3.1,
and capital equipment fund requirements are shown in Table 6.4.3.2.

6.4.4 Facilities

Most of the basic studies and initial development efforts will be per-
formed in existing facilities of rather modest requirements {analytical
laboratories with standard hoods). As the program proceeds and materials
involving progressively more severe radiation hazards are encountered,
space will be used in existing alpha-containment facilities either at
the Transuranium Laboratory or the MSRP alpha facility in Building 4501.
Ultimately, an existing hot cell facility such as the Hot-Cell Spectro-
photometric Installation may be required to contain melts emitting more
penetrating radiation. Also, the engineering installations in which
in-line measurements are made serve as facilities for this task group,
because the in-line measurements made therein may reveal practical
deficiencies in the methods. In addition, installations containing
large quantities of salt sometimes present opportunities for stability

studies and calibrations that are not feasible with small research melts.

Final perfection of many of the in-line electrochemical methods will be

performed with salt streams delivered by the Analytical Test Facility Et
(ATF) which is discussed in Subsection 6.9.

6.4.5 Task 5.1.1 Fuel salt analysis

 

The predominant emphasis of past research and development studies has
been on measurements in fuel or in melts of fuel solvent composition.
These studies have led to successful in-line analyses”? and to in situ
measurements during the loading of fuel pins under conditions requiring
radiation containment.®® It is expected that a strong emphasis on fuel ss
analysis will continue throughout the early stages of the program until
materials problems are resolved. All of the earlier work was performed

in melts of MSRE solvent composition and many of the basic measurements,
particularly diffusion coefficients, will have to be repeated in the
thorium-bearing breeder compositions. In-line applications may serve as
screening tests to eliminate some of the lengthy remeasurements. Measure-
ments will be greatly improved when an insulating material is found that =
is fully compatible with the fuel. Such a material would permit a more

precise definition of electrode areas and thus improve the precision of

the measurements. A search for better insulators will be pursued through- Gn
out the specific investigations outlined in the subtasks below. Fluoride
salt streams associated with the processing system will also be included
in this task group, since their properties will be similar to those of
the fuel.

6.4.5.1 Subtask 5.1.1.1 Determination of g3+/pit ratios fi

The fuel salt redox potential, as indicated by the uit/uht ratio, exerts
a profound influence on the chemical and, perhaps, some physical prop-
erties of the fuel. It determines the corrosiveness of the fuel with
respect to structural materials, influences the disposition of certain
fission products and tritium, and may affect the surface tension and
wettability of melts. The voltammetric determination of yd+/utt ratio
is the most fully developed of the present in-line electroanalytical
methods and has been profitably applied to in-line and ip situ measure-

ments. Although the method has not yet been studied thoroughly in MSBR Ei
fuel salt, it should be generally applicable to any melt in which re-

versible reduction waves can be recorded. In fact, waves recorded

recently during in-line measurements in a thorium~bearing fuel salt in Lo
a forced-convection loop exhibit no qualitative differences from those
obtained earlier in MSRE fuel salt. The precision of the method is
excellent; reproducibility of 2 percent was obtained in MSRE melts during
automated operation with digital smoothing and averaging of the voltam-
meter output. The accuracy of the method is not as well established.

It has been found that the potential developed by different noble-metal
electrodes may vary by as much as 15 mv when inserted into the same melt. Gi
This would correspond to an error in ud3t/utt ratio measurements of about

 
Re

 

6-23

20 percent. Other potential sources of error include IR drops resulting
from the resistance of the melt or of electrode leads, junction potentials,
and distortion of the reduction waves caused by melt flow patterns or
deposits on the electrodes. These variables are expected to introduce
only small and perhaps compensating errors, so that the accuracy of the
method is without doubt adequate for present usage in measuring and con-
trolling the redox potential of fluoride salts in technological experi-
ments. For future applications, such as measuring the charge balance

of an operating reactor to determine the oxidative effect of fuel burn-up,
the highest possible accuracy will be needed.

The effects of all conceivably significant variables will be studied to
establish their impact on the accuracy of the method. Where possible,
errors will be eliminated or quantified for correction, and specifications
will be established for the installation and operating requirements
necessary for a particular level of accuracy and precision. When prac-
tical, many of these studies will be performed during in-line measurements
to provide more realistic evaluation conditions and to effect economies

in overall Program effort. It is likely that final perfection of the
method will require the use of closely controlled salt streams in the
Analytical Test Facility (Task Group 5.6).

6.4.5.2 Subtask 5.1.1.2 Determination of ionic corrosion products

 

Methods will be required for the continuous determination of ppm concen-
trations of corrosion product ions, particularly chromous ions, in fuel
streams in order to monitor corrosion of reactor fuel systems and to
assist in basic studies of corrosion mechanisms. Complete electrochemical
characterizations!7»23725 have been carried out in MSRE solvents for

ions that might enter a moderately oxidizing fuel salt via corrosion of
titanium-modified Hastelloy-N, specifically: Fe2t, NiZt, cr2t, and Ti3%
and Ti%". Concentrations of the first three of these ions have been
estimated during in-line measurements; the measurement of cr? in actual
fuel melts is subject to interference from the adjacent uranium wave.

The electroanalytical chemistry of these ions will be characterized in
MSBR fuel salt along with molybdenum and those ions that may be generated
by other additions to Hastelloy N. Again, where practical, initial
screening studies will be performed during in-line measurements. Efforts
will be made to improve the resolution of closely associated waves and
the accuracy of the measurements (now estimated at 10 to 20 percent for
typical concentrations) by proper selection of electrode materials, better
definition of electrode areas, the use of pulsed and stripping techniques,
and digital processing of the resulting data (see Task Group 5.7). Such
improvements would permit more rapid detection of changes in corrosion
rates and, perhaps, the location of areas of more rapid attack in multi-
loop systems.
6-24

6.4.5.3 Subtask 5.1.1.3 Determination of bismuth

 

Because bismuth could damage nickel-based structural materials, its con-
centration must be maintained at tolerable levels in the salt returned
from the processing system. Continuous methods that are sensitive to

ppb levels of bismuth must be developed to monitor the effectiveness of
bismuth removal systems. Electrochemical studies in MSRE solvents have
shown that BiF3; is reduced to the metal at a potential more positive

than that for the reduction of nickel with evidence of alloy formation
with some electrode materials. In voltammetry, reduction wave heights
are proportional to the molar concentrations of the reducible species.
The high equivalent weight of bismuth, therefore, makes it highly im-
probable that the needed sensitivities can be achieved by direct voltam-
metric measurement. Although stripping techniques can, in theory, be
extended to almost any desired concentration level it appears likely

that interference from the adjacent nickel wave will limit this approach
at the Ni/Bi ratios expected in the fuel. The earlier studies also showed
that BiF3 disappeared slowly from fuel solvent melts, which was attributed
to reaction with or absorption by the container material. However, in
view of recently reported data,>® the observed behavior may have resulted
from volatization. In most reactor streams bismuth will be present as
entrained metal particulates. Since electrochemical techniques do not
respond to particulates, a necessary part of the analytical development
work will be the in-line oxidation of all forms of bismuth to the tri-
valent state.

High priority will be assigned to establishing the feasibility of in situ
bismuth determinations. Measurements will be resumed with the immediately
available MSRE solvents in a more impervious container (glassy carbon)
than used previously, and work will shift shortly to measurements with
MSBR fuel salt when this material is available from salt production
activities. The route of BiF3 depletion will be established. If the
material is volatized from the melt, a transpiratiocnal analysis approach
will be evaluated (Subtask 5.3.2.4). Studies will be made in melts con-
taining both BiF3; and NiF,. If the anticipated interference is observed,
the following approaches for circumventing this difficulty will be tested:
(1) Search for an electrode material that will selectively alloy bismuth
and thus provide the needed resolution from nickel, (2) removal of co-
deposited nickel as Ni(CO}y prior to measurement of bismuth by stripping,
and (3) further veltammetric reduction of deposited bismuth to the
bismuthide.”’ When electrochemical characteristics are adequately estab-
lished for in situ measurements, homogeneous reduction of BiF3 and reoxi-
dation of the dispersed metal will be studied. Efforts within the task
will include electrolytic oxidation at porous electrodes and oxidation
studies by transpiration metheds (Task 5.3.2). Unless unexpectedly
stable dispersions of bismuth in salt can be generated, completion of
oxidation studies must await availability of the Analytical Test Facility
(Task Group 5.6).

6.4.5.4 Subtask 5.1.1.4 Tellurium studies

 

Because evidence exists that tellurium contributed to intergranular cor-
rosion of standard Hastelloy N in the MSRE, knowledge of its chemistry

in fluoride salts is needed for the materials development program. Al-
though it is not expected that in-line electrochemical methods will be
practical for measurement of tellurium at concentrations anticipated in
an MSR, priority has been assigned to electrecanalytical characterization
of tellurium species in fuel solvents in order to establish meaningful
conditions for evaluation of the resistance of modified Hastelly N to
attack by tellurium. The data obtained (decomposition potentials of the
metal, diffusion coefficients and stability ranges of diverse oxidation
states) will be of value in designing and executing experiments on devel~
opment of modified Hastelloy N. Characterization studies have been
started in MSRE solvent, and work will shift shortly to MSBR fuel salt.
The data obtained in these studies will also be used to assess the poten-
tial for electroanalytical measurement of tellurium in materials develop-
ment experiments. Needed in-line support will be provided for research
and development studies in which tellurium concentrations are sufficiently
high for measurement.

6.4.5.5 Subtask 5.1.1.5 Determination of protactinium

 

In order to maintain an overall system doubling time of 19 yrs in an MSBR,
protactinium must be continuously removed on a cycle of about 10 days
from areas of high neutron flux density. Sensitive in-line methods for
its determination will be required to monitor the effectiveness of the
protactinium removal system. At steady state operation, the concentration
of protactinium in the fuel will be maintained by the processing system
at about one percent of that of uranium. Concentrations of this order
can be measured by present veltammetric techniques, and expected improve~
ments will provide sufficient sensitivity to detect residual concentra-
tions in processing streams, if interfering waves are not encountered.

No electroanalytical measurements have been made for protactinium because
of the lack of a facility in which alpha-emitting materials can be used,
but estimations of wave positions have been made from thermodynamic con-
siderations. The Pa“" to Pa3" reduction wave should occur at a more
negative potential than the U3t to U0 wave and hopefully will be resolved
from the Th*' to Th3* wave which determines the melt limits. The Pa

to Past oxidation wave should be more cathodic than (precede) the nickel
decomposition wave, Nil to NiZt, which is unlikely to be observed in fuel
melts: but may be subject to interference from an iron stripping wave.
The protactinium oxidation wave may also be complicated by deposition

of oxides since Pay05 is one of the least soluble oxides in fluoride
melts.

On the basis of these considerations, measurements of protactinium in

fuel melts may be difficult; however, measurements may be possible at
judiciously selected points in the processing system. The effluent from
the fluorinator will contain the same concentration of protactinium as

the fuel, but with only about equivalent quantities of interfering uranium.
6-26

Also, oxide, if present, would be substantially removed by fluorination.
Similarly, the concentration of protactinium in the effluent salt from
the protactinium extraction step will be essentially equal te that in
the stream returned to the reactor, but be largely free of uranium,
oxide, iron, and nickel. Thus, the most sensitive measurements can be
performed in this stream, which will contain the lowest concentration
of protactinium.

Electrochemical characterization of protactinium will be carried out in
MSBR fuel carrier salt when facilities and materials are available. It

is likely that work will be carried out initially during in situ analyses
in support of basic chemical research to determine the free energy of

the Pa t/rpaSt couple. Such investigations would be performed in a-facil-
ies in Building 4501, and would provide experience in eiectroanalytical
research on a-containing melts and allow development of criteria for the
design of an appropriate ag-facility for further electroanalytical research
and development. When analytical a-facilities are available, more refined
studies of protactinium will be made by using the most advanced electro-
analytical techniques in highly purified solvent and in admixture with
realistic concentrations of expected interferences. These latter studies
may lead to an alternate approach for the electroanalytical measurement

of traces of oxide in MSBR fuel salt.

6.4.5.6 Subtask 5.1.1.6 Determination of plutonium

 

Plutonium will be present in reactor fuels as a major constituent, if
PuF3 is used as a start-up fuel, or in trace concentrations in an MSBR
operating on the 232Th-233y fuel cycle. At this time, no electroana-
lytical studies of plutonium ions in fluoride melts have been made and
there are at present no imminent experiments within the MSR Program that
require the electroanalytical determination of plutonium. When alpha-
containment facilities are established, the electrochemistry of plutonium
will be thoroughly studied in breeder-composition melts. Particular
attention will be given to investigation of a reversible soluble redox
plutonium couple that cculd serve as an alternate to the pit ust voltam—~
metric method for the measurement of the redox condition of the fuel.
Plutonium is expected to be present predominately in the trivalent state
and, if another soluble oxidation state can be generated reversibly within
the solvent electrolysis limits, the voltammetric technique for ratio
measurements can be applied. The possible interference of major and
trace concentrations of plutonium with other electroanalytical analyses
will be evaluated. Studies with plutonium will be suspended after suf-
ficient basic data has been acquired to establish the feasibility of an
in-line plutonium analysis method.

6.4.5.7 Subtask 5.1.1.7 Determination of total corrosion products

 

Inferences from analytical data from the operation of the MSRE and from
thermodynamic considerations indicate that the major fraction of the
more-noble corrosion products such as iron and nickel will be present as

Fl

 
 

 

6-27

particulate metals in an MSBR. A significant fraction of chromium could
be incorporated in the particulates by alloying. The measurement of
these metallic corrosion products will be needed to provide a completely
effective system for monitoring corrosion within the fuel system. Elec-
trolytic techniques will be investigated as a means of converting the
particulate matter to measurable ions, perhaps with coulometric inte-
gration of the reduction current. Electrochemical methods will also be
used to support oxidation studies by chemical means (see Task 5.3.2).
Some of the early studies will be made in the GSTF which will be equipped
with large penetrations for analytical devices. This early work will
provide realistic samples in which the total corrosion product concen-
trations will be established by repeated chemical analyses.

6.4.5.8 Subtask 5.1.1.8 Determination of total uranium

 

The electroanalytical measurement of the total concentration of uranium
with the precision required to maintain adequate inventory measurements
within the primary system appears to be beyond the foreseeable capabili-
ties of these techniques. Precisions substantially better than +0.1%
would be needed to detect losses through deposition that could compromise
the nuclear stability of a reactor, and other methods will be developed
for determination of long-term reactivity balances (see Section 12).
Presently, it is estimated that in appropriate in-line system precisions
of +10% are achievable. Measurements with this precision could provide
useful data in some fluoride streams associated with the processing
system. Moreover, the precision may be improved to perhaps *17Z by use

of precisely defined electrode areas and by application of digital
techniques. Potential needs for in-line determination of uranium include
the measurement of high concentrations in return streams from the proc-
essing system, residual concentrations in processing streams from which
the uranium is removed by fluorination or reductive extraction, and trace
concentrations in waste salt streams.

Improved techniques for defining electrode areas and reducing salt flow
effects will be used to increase the accuracy and precision of the
measurement of moderate to high concentrations of uranium in fluoride
salts. Developments in pulsed and stripping techniques will be used

to increase the sensitivity of the measurements of trace concentrations.
Techniques such as chronocoulometry and controlled potential coulometry
will be tested for application to salt streams such as the effluent from
the protactinium extraction step in which the uranium will be in the
trivalent state.

6.4.5.9 Subtask 5.1.1.9 Determination of protonated species

 

One means of controlling tritium emissions from a molten salt reactor is:
to operate with the fuel salt at redox conditions that will retain a
major fraction of the tritium in a combined form and prevent diffusion
of tritium into the coolant salt. Since the concentration of oxide in
6-28

the salt will necessarily be low, it is expected that the predominant
tritium-containing species will be TF, rather than OT . Measurement of
the ratio of free to combined tritium would contribute to studies of
tritium distribtuion in fuel salt systems, and will perhaps be needed
to monitor protonated species in the reactor fuel. In the electro-
analytical studies involving coolant salts, Task 5.1.3, it has been

demonstrated that ppb concentrations of an active proton species, i
probably HF, in NaBF,, can be measured by controlled-potential electroly-
sis using an evacuated palladium electrode. Because the electrolyzed
hydrogen can be readily recovered in a countable form, the approach is
adaptable to the measurement of active tritons in the coolant. It has
been proposed, but not yet. demonstrated, that the ratio of elemental to
combined hydrogen can be determined by comparing the pressure rise rates
within an electrically isclated electrodes to that within a cathodically
poised electrode.

Applicability of the hollow palladium electrode will be tested in i
research melts of breeder composition that are subjected to varying over
pressures of hydrogen and HF. The effects of trace oxide additions om
such melts will alsc be studied. When the capabilities of the methods
are established, experiments will be designed to study the distribution
of protonated species in MSBR fuel salt the GSTF under realistic gas
stripping conditions. When all possible data has been obtained with
hydrogen and possibly deuterium, experiments with tritium will be per-
formed to provide final evaluation of the method.

6.4.5.10 Subtask 5.1.1.10 Determination of oxide

The in-line determination of oxide is of prime importance since oxide
could cause precipitation of protactinium and fissile and fertile materials
from the fuel. The sensitivity requirement for in-line measurements will
not be known until the oxide tolerance of the fuel is more accurately
established but could be as low as 20 ppm. Voltammetric techniques

respond to the activities of dissolved ions and are, therefore, unsuit-
able for the determination of total oxide if some of the oxide is present
as a precipitate. Thus, sensitive electroanalytical methods would be i
of greatest value during normal operations at oxide concentrations below
the tolerance level of the fuel and would complement rather than replace
transpiration methods which would be applicable at the higher oxide
levels . {Subtask 5.3.2.2).

 

In early experiments in MSRE solvent, a cathodic wave was observed that

was attributed to the reduction of hydroxide to oxide and hydrogen, and Bi
an anodic wave resulting from the oxidation of oxide to oxygen. Further

study of these waves was discontinued when it was found that they would

be subject to interference by the reduction and oxidation waves of UF. a
Studies of voltammetry of oxygen-containing species will be performed

in breeder fuel compositions. Techniques for resolving oxide waves from

interfering uranium electrode reactions will be evaluated (digital
processing and/or selective electrodes such as silver for oxide). If es
 

EE

6-29

direct electrochemical methods prove inapplicable, a combination tech-
nique will be developed, e.g., electrolysis of melts at controlled
potential with sparging and measurement of liberated oxygen or oxygen
compounds by gas analytical techniques.

For research studies in the breeder melts, it will be necessary to avoid
atmospheric contamination more rigorously than was required for MSRE
compositions. To this end dry box facilities are being upgraded with
dynamic purification systems to reduce oxide and moisture concentrations
to less than 1 ppm.

6.4.5.11 Subtask 5.1.1.11 Determination of niobium

 

Of the noble fission products, niobium is the most susceptible to oxida-
tion. During the operation of the MSRE, major decreases in I5Nb concen~
tration were observed in the salt phase when adjustments of fuel redox
potential were made by beryllium additions. > Thus, niobium merits
electrochemical investigation, both to assess its potential as an aux-
iliary index of fuel redox potential in future reactors and to provide

a tool for evaluation of MSRE data. Also, niobium may be used to modify
the properties of Hastelloy N and thus could enter the fuel as a
corrosion product. A rather extensive electroanalytical study of niobium
was carried out in earlier research in MSRE solvents. >? However, inter-
ference from traces of oxide in the melts prevented complete characteri-
zation. Electroanalytical studies of niobium will be carried out in
breeder solvents, from which oxide contamination is more carefully
excluded, to gain basic data and to assess the potential of the technique
for in~line measurements. The effects of oxide additions at levels below
the melt tolerance will be studied and limited measurements in MSRE
compositions will be made for comparison and further understanding of
MSRE experience.

6.4.5.12 Subtask 5.1.1.12 Determination of chloride

Chloride could enter the fuel via entrainment in bismuth streams from

the rare earth removal step of the processing system. It is anticipated
that chloride can be tolerated at low levels in the fuel salt, and its
concentration will be limited by removal of chloride during the fluorina-
tion step. However, a method will be needed for determination of chloride
in fluoride streams of the processing system. No measurements have yet
been made, but the voltammetric oxidation of chloride ion to the element
appears to be the most promising electroanalytical approach. An electro-
analytical investigation will be carried out to determine whether a
useful oxidation wave can be isolated from the possible interfering waves
of UF, or oxide. Selectively active electrodes will be sought; and, if
wave resolution proves impractical, the potential of a combination of
electrolytic and transpiration techniques will be assessed. The effect
of traces of chloride on the voltammetry of other ions in the fuel will
also be investigated as a possible approach to in-line measurement.
6-30

6.4.5.13 Subtask 5.1.1.13 Studies of noble fission products

 

At anticipated conditions of normal reactor operation it is not expected
that fission products more noble than niobium will be in ionic solution
in sufficient concentration to permit electroanalytical measurement.
Possible exceptions may be sub-zero oxidation states similar to those

in the case of tellurium. Electrochemical studies will provide basic i
chemical information such as redox potentials and stabilized oxidation
states under varying redox conditions. More practical information that
will be gained will be the effects of such elements on analytical methods.
The noble metals could deposit on electrodes and alter their character-
istics or possibly cause electrode damage. A roughly analogous problem
was encountered during voltammetric measurements in NaBF, coolant.

Nickel, a relatively noble metal in this environment, formed an unexpected EE
deposit on electrically isolated electrodes that prevented accurate

voltammetric measurement of Fed! and active protons.

Basic electrochemical studies will be performed on a low priority for
noble fission product elements in breeder fuel melts at various redox
potentials. For those cases in which evidence of potential problems

is obtained, such as anomalous stripping phenomena, plans for extended
exposure of electrodes will be established, and the physical and electro-
chemical properties of the exposed specimens will be compared with those

of fresh electrodes. The study will be extended to other noble trace ts
elements that may be present either in the initial fuel or introduced by

corrosion of special materials, such as precious metal brazing alloys,

or transmutation products. f=

6.4.5.14 Subtask 5.1.1.14 Determination of transuranium elements
and salt-soluble fission products

 

During the operating life of a power reactor, diverse transuranium

elements and electropositive fission products can be present in fluoride Gi
streams of the fuel and processing systems in concentrations sufficient

for measurement or detection by electroanalytical techniques. The concen-

tration of some of these elements may increase throughout the operation

of the reactor but many will reach a steady-state level as a result of

removal by the processing system. There are at present no anticipated

needs for the in-line measurement of these elements in an operating

reactor, and if such a need arises many of them can probably be measured

more effectively by y-spectrometry (Task Group 5.5). However, detection

of some of these materials may be required in the processing systems.

Electroanalytical characterization studies will generate data to predict bd
the electrochemical behavior of these elements and provide the necessary
information for in-line support activities. A more important product of
the basic studies will be to permit prediction of potential interference
by these elements with essential in-line methods. Should voltammetric
waves from such elements occur at potentials similar to those being
measured at trace concentration levels, the accuracy of needed measure-

ments could be compromised. The measurement of protactinium is i

 
 

Sa

 

6-31

particularly vulnerable to such interference. In all likelihood, compen-
sation can be made for moderate interferences by computer techniques
but only if the interference is anticipated.

A survey will be maintained of all trace elements that could be present
in the fuel at electroanalytically significant levels. Electroanalytical
studies will be performed for such elements on a schedule that will be
consistent with the needs of the Program. Unless special needs develop,
this will be a low-priority activity. As more sensitive analytical
methods are developed they will be used to scan samples of typical fuel
and solvent preparations to determine whether other trace constituents
should be included in this activity. Methods will be established to
handle interferences that are discovered.

6.4.5.15 Subtask 5.1.1.15 Development of reference electrodes

A reliable reference electrode would offer several advantages to the in~-
line analysis program. For basic studies, a reference electrode based
on a redox couple of established thermodynamic properties can be used
for the direct estimation of free energies of formation of electroactive
species in melts. A reference electrode of established reliability
would make it possible to utilize direct potentiometric measurements
instead of the voltammetric U3+/UY' ratio for the determination of redox
potentials in the fuel and the required instrumentation would be
simplified. Potentiometric methods would also be applicable to process-—
ing streams from which uranium has been removed. In such applications,

a reference electrode would prevent the possibility of the misassigoment
of peaks as a result of abrupt changes in the potential of a quasi-
reference electrode with redox conditions in the processing streams. Lt
should be noted that other voltammetric features, such as melt limits,
can serve as surrogates for a reference electrode, but excessive use of
such "markers' can cause degradation of indicator electrode performance.
The major problem in development of reference electrodes in fluoride
melts is associated with the unavailability of compatible insulting
materials that are needed to effect ionic contact between the melts and
reference compartments. Installation requirements will also limit an
in-line reference electrode to a small device of unit construction.

Reference electrodes for limited service have been fabricated using a
boron-nitride membrane as a "salt bridge."®? Devices that offer accept-
ably reproducible potentials for periods of months32 have been developed
by using a single crystal lanthanum fluoride as an ionic conductor. In
such devices the reference solution (a melt saturated with NiF,) is
contained in a cavity in the crystal and dissolution of the crystal by
the salt is limited by contact with the salt through a metal frit.
Problems with this electrode have included occasional cracking of the
lanthanum fluoride, presumably under thermal stress, and difficulties,
reported by others, in retaining the reference solution in the cavity.
6-32

Lanthanum fluoride reference electrodes will be installed in the GSTF

for testing in breeder fuel under realistic conditions. In these tests,

potentiometric response will be compared with values calculated from ws
U3*/u*t ratios to establish the validity of the technique.

An analysis of the present reference electrode design will be made te wi
devise modifications that will reduce stresses and ensure retention of
the reference solution. As better insulating materials are identified,
they will be incorporated into electrodes of improved designs. Existing
and future electrodes will also be tested in melt compositions corre-
sponding to processing streams.

 

6.4.6 Task 5.1.2 LiCl analyses

 

The metal transfer process will be used to remove high cross-section iin
rare-earth fission products from MSBR fuel carrier salt after the
removal of uranium and protactinium. This will involve the selective
chemical reduction of materials from the fuel salt into liquid bismuth
followed by back extractions into molten lithium chloride. In addition
to the rare earths, the alkali-metal and alkaline—earth fission products
and a number of the actinides will transfer to the LiCl. Also the use

of this versatile system for actinide recycle may introduce additional EE
constituents into the LiCl. Electroanalytical research in this area

will be carried out to develop in-line methods to monitor the accumu-

lation of constituents including corrosion products, uranium, thorium, wn

fluoride, and actinide elements, in the lithium chloride. It is ex-
pected that the electrode insulator problem will not be as severe as
that encountered in molten fluorides and therefore a more precise r

definition of electrode areas will bring about a significant improvement
in the precision of voltammetric measurements. Further refinement of
the data through pulsed veltammetric techniques and digital processing
methods will be used to improve precision and sensitivity. In view of @
more pressing electroanalytical research needs for fuel and coolant salt
analyses, the lithium chloride research is not expected to begin until
FY 1978. In the meantime, the literature will be surveyed and pertinent
information on chloride melts which has been reported by others will be
utilized whenever applicable. Also, the requirements for analyses in
this medium are speculative to a degree until further fuel processing
studies are performed.

 

6.4.6:1 Subtask 5.1.2.1 Determination of uranium GE

 

During normal operation of the processing system, uranium will be
largely removed upstream of the metal transfer process system by
fiuorination. Therefore, only trace concentrations of uranium will
normally be present in the lithium chloride. The measurement of such
concentrations may be needed for inventory purposes, for process con-
trols, or for ensuring against losses of uranium. The uranium will a
probably be present as UCly which should be measurable by anodic
 

 

6-33

voltammetry or perhaps chronocoulometry. Voltammetric techniques will

be used to characterize the electrochemistry of uranium in chloride

melts by measuring basic properties such as electrode reversibility,
diffusion coefficients, stable valence states. When the electrochemistry
of other species in lithium chloride has been studied, practical details
for in-line analysis will be considered. This will include the appli-
cation of pulse voltammetric techniques, digital methods for data
processing and perhaps stripping techniques to provide resolution from
adjacent waves and improve the sensitivity of the measurement.

6.4.6.2 Subtask 5.1.2.2 Determination of ionic corrosion products

 

Lithium chloride streams in the processing system may contain traces of
the typical corrosion products (iron, chromium, and nickel) that have
been transferred from the fuel, and also corrosion products from struc-
tural materials of the processing system. These latter materials

may include molybdenum, tungsten, and tantalum, and perhaps diverse
constituents from brazing alloys that may used to join refractory metal
components. Because the lithium chloride melts will be in contact with
solutions of electro-positive metals in bismuth, the melts are expected
to be quite reducing, and the concentration of ionic corrosion products
will assuredly be low. A possible exception is sub-zero oxidation
states that may be stable in these highly reduced melts. The studies
in this subtask will not be restricted to reducing melts, however,
because the electroanalytical methods may also be applied to the deter-
mination of total corrosion products after oxidation (see Subtask
5.1.2.7). Electrochemical characterization of these substances has not
been carried out in lithium chloride. Others, however, have reported
electrochemical measurements in similar melts, such as LiC1-KC1.61

Use will be made of this information wherever applicable when the lithium
chloride research is under way. It is expected that separations and
resolution of voltammetric waves will be comparable to that observed in
the fuel salt. The electrochemical properties of anticipated corrosion
product ions will be measured in melts of various oxidation potentials.
Application will be made of anodic stripping or pulsed voltammetric
techniques to provide improved sensitivities. In-line measurements on
process streams will also be made whenever practical for screening
purposes and for evaluation of the electroanalytical methods.

6.4.6.3 Subtask 5.1.2.3 Determination of thorium

 

The thorium which enters the lithium chloride will in large part be
transferred to the waste streams. It will, therefore, be desirable to
provide in-line methods for the measurement of thorium in the lithium
chloride. The equilibrium concentration of thorium in the lithium
chloride is expected to be quite low (v3.3 x 107% mole fraction). It
appears that voltammetric stripping or pulsed techniques have the greatest
potential for this determination. First efforts will be to characterize
the electrode reaction in molten lithium chloride in research melts:

then work will be directed toward adapting the most promising techniques
to in-line situations.
6-34

6.4.6.4 Subtask 5.1.2.4 Determination of plutonium

 

Plutonium will normally be removed from the fuel carrier salt in the
protactinium reduction step and would not normally enter the lithium
chloride stream. However, some carry-over may be expected, particularly
when the processing system is used after start-up with plutonium as a
fuel. The need for in-line measurements is therefore not thoroughly
established, but sufficient characterization will be made to establish
the basic electrochemistry of plutonium in lithium chloride and deter-
mine the feasibility of its measurement. No known electrochemical data
exists in this area. Characterization will be done when appropriate
alpha=-containment facilities are available.

6.4.6.5 Subtask 5.1.2.5 Determination of fluoride

 

The presence of fluoride in lithium chloride streams of the processing ei
system will increase the quantity of thorium that is transferred into

these streams. In order to reduce thorium losses, it is desirable to

contrcl the concentration of fluoride at low percentage levels. The Gi
possibility of developing a fluoride ion specific electrode will be
investigated. Single crystal LaF3 (a fluoride ion conductor at high
temperatures) will be used to construct a specific ion electrode provided
its solubility in lithium chloride is not too high. Parameters to be
delineated will be Nernstian response, response time, limits of detection,
reproducibility of the potential measurements, and useful life times of
the LaF; crystal in molten lithium chloride. =

6.4.6.6 Subtask 5.1.2.6 Development of reference electrodes Gi

 

Reference electrodes will be needed for basic electroanalytical studies
in molten lithium chloride. Potentiometric measurements will provide a
direct measure of the relative thermodynamic stability of electrocactive
species in this medium. A stable reference potential will also be needed
for measurements of the potential of a specific fluoride ion electrode
{Subtask 5.1.2.5) and for an oxide electrode {Subtask 5.1.2.8). The
electrode may also be used to measure the concentration of certain elec-
troactive species in the melt or in bismuth and to indicate divergence
from equilibration between the salt and bismuth alloy. The two most Gi
commonly used reference electrodes in molten chloride are based on the
silver~silver chloride and the platinum (I1)-platinum couples. Electrodes
based on these couples will be tested in synthetic melts at process
temperatures. Electrodes suitable for in-line measurements will be
developed and tested for various potentiometric applications.

 

6.4.6.7 Subtask 5.1.2.7 Determination of total corrosion products

 

It is anticipated that most of the corrosion products will be present i
in a reduced condition in the highly reduced chloride melts of the proc-—
essing system. Except for the possibility of a few elements that may
 

6-35

possess soluble sub-zero oxidation states, most corrosion products will
not be directly measurable by the electrcanalytical methods. In-line
electrolytic methods will be tested for the quantitative conversion of
corrosion products to soluble ionic species. Chemical methods such as
transpiration with HCl or chlorine will also be tested under Task Group
5.3. The most successful oxidation method will be combined with electro-
analytical methods to provide a device for the in-line measurement of

the total concentrations of individual corrosion products.

6.4.6.8 Subtask 5.1.2.8 Determination of oxide

The role of oxide in the metal transfer process is not yet thoroughly
understood. Oxide layers are believed to have decreased the rate of
transfer of materials between bismuth and salt in engineering experiments,
and significant oxide could increase the corrosivity of lithium chloride
and affect the distribution coefficients of certain metals between the
salt and metal phases. It therefore appears likely that it will be
necessary to monitor and control oxide concentration in the lithium
chloride streams and an in-line method for the determination of oxides
would assist such control. From thermodynamic considerations it appears
unlikely that a voltammetric wave for uncomplexed oxides will be avail-
able within the working limits of lithium chloride melts. This assump-
tion will, of course, be checked experimentally and a search for waves

of oxide complexes such as oxianions will be made. It is likely, there~
fore, that potentiometric measurements will offer the most fruitful
approach. Because it appears that ceramic materials will be less subject
to attack in this medium than in the molten fluorides, the development

of more conventional electrochemical cells should be possible. Appreaches
will include the use of selective ceramic membranes and the development
of capillary or porous ceramic salt bridges between electrochemical half
cells. Zirconia doped with calcium becomes an ionic conductor at high
temperatures by virtue of mobile oxide ions and will be tested for appli-~
cation to a specific oxide electrode. Electrode couples reported to
behave reversibly with respect to oxide ion in molten LiCl-KC1l include
Cu/Cuy0, Pt/Pt0, Pd/Pd0 and Bi/BiOCl.

The behaviour of these couples will be investigated in pure LiCl melts.
The most favorable of these couples and the most practical means of
developing ionic contact with the lithium chloride melts will be used

to design an electrode in accordance with the usual requirements of

unit construction for in-line application. Models of this electrode
will be evaluated for parameters such as Nernstian response, response
time, limits of detection, and reproducibility of potential measurements.
When a satisfactory electrode appears to have been developed it will be
subjected to long term exposures in research melts or in-line application
to establish its reliability and useful lifetime.
6-36

6.4.7 Task 5.1.3 Coclant salt analysis

 

Currently, a large fraction of the electroanalytical research and develop-

ment effort is being devoted to applications in the proposed eutectic

coolant, NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole %). These studies are primarily concerned

with the development of methods for the in-line measurement of corrosion

product ions and protonic species and with the establishment of the nature ss
and properties of protonated species in the molten coolant. The measure-

ment and control of protonated species in the coolant is of particular

interest because of the potential use ¢f the coolant for the containment hh
of tritium. Studies of protonated species are of high priority because
operation of the Coolant-Salt Technology Facility (CSTF) — the first major
facility to be equipped with a suitable system for in-line electroana-
lytical measurements — is about to be resumed. One of the first experi-
ments with this facility, the Deuterium Injection Experiment, 62 is
designed to provide definitive data on the effectiveness of fluorcborate
for the containment of tritium that will be generated in the reactor =
fuel salt. In-line measurements will be needed to determine the distri-
bution of deuterium which will be used as a stand-in for tritium. Mate-
rials compatibility studies will also be performed in this facility,
probably concurrently with the deuterium experiments. In-line support

of these activities will be provided by the electreoanalytical measurement
of corrosion product ions. Research and development studies will also

be carried out in alternate coolant compositions that may be selected
later. Many of the candidate coolant salts are expected to have similar
properties to the MSRE fuel solvent in which extensive electroanalytical

studies have already been made. Unless a really novel composition is wi
selected as an alternate coolant, the required development studies will

be limited to the measurement of essential constants such as diffusion

coefficients, and the characterization of new constituents that may be i
incorporated into container materials. Therefore, no details for studies

in alternate coolants will be projected for these subtasks.

 

6.4.7.1 Subtask 5.1.2.1 Determination of ionic corrosion products

 

 

As in fuel melts, in-line methods for the measurement of corrosion
product ions, particularly Crs , will be needed to monitor corrosion
within the coolant system. The measurement of chromic ions in fluoro-
borate melts will be of even greater importance because of the rather Gi
low solubility of CrFj3 in this coolant. The concentration of cr3* must
be limited to a value that will not permit the deposition of NajCrFg at
the coolest region of the heat exchanger. Corrosion products of new
alloying constituents (such as titanium, niobium, and cerium) that may we
be incorporated into the container material could also serve as effective

corrosion indicators and will require investigation. Exploratory voltam—

metric measurements have been performed for cedt, Fed+, Fe2t, Ti3t, and as
Ti and further work will be required for complete characterization of

these ions. Rather brief measurements during earlier operation of the

CSTF demonstrated that voltammetric reduction waves could be recorded »
with acceptable reproducibility (v10 to 20 percent at the 30 to 100 ppm -
 

 

 

6-37

level) for iron and chromium ions, and for a, newly discovered wave that
probably corresponds to the reduction of MoS". The measurement of nickel
was found to be impractical because of the low solubility of NiF, in
fluoroborates. Although each of the waves is distinctly observable,
quantitative interpretation of the waves from this multicomponent mixture
of ions is difficult because early (more cathodic) waves contribute a
significant but indeterminate current at the peak potential of the suc-
ceeding wave. Further measurements of individual ions and combinations
of ions will be performed in research melts to obtain data for quanti-
tative interpretation of voltammograms. Pulsed voltammetry and computer
methods®? will be tested for improving resolution of adjacent waves. In-
line measurements will be performed throughout the operation of the CSTF
to detect relative changes in the concentrations of corrosion products
that result from various experiments and to provide data that can be
interpreted more quantitatively after additional development work is
completed.

6.4.7.2 Subtask 5.1.3.2 Determination of protonated species

Because of the potential value of the coolant salt for the containment

of tritium, the measurement of protonated species in the proposed coolant
salt is of primary importance. The monitoring of protonated species
could also provide information on corrosion rates as a function of the
concentration of protonated species and serve as a possible detection
technique for steam generator leaks. We will continue investigating a
unique electroanalytical technique that is specific for hydrogen. The
method is based on the diffusion of hydrogen into an evacuated palladium
tube electrode when the coolant salt is electrolyzed at a controlled
potential. Both the amplitude of voltammetric waves recorded at the
palladium electode and the rate of increase of hydrogen pressure within
the electrode are proportional to the concentration of an active pro-
tonated species, probably HF, , in fluoroborate melts. The pressure
measurement provides the greatest sensitivity. Standard additions to

the 500 Kg of NaBF,-NaF coolant in the CSTF have demonstrated that active
proton concentrations of a few parts per billion will produce a measurable
pressure rise on electrolysis. An electrode of even better sensitivity
will be needed to support deuterium injection studies.

The sensitivity of the active proton measurement will be increased at
least tenfold by using an electrode of larger area that is coupled with
an improved vacuum system and a more sensitive pressure measuring device.
This improved system will be calibrated at the CSTF by standard addition
techniques (standard additions at these low concentration levels are

not practical for small research melts) and used in support of experi-
ments in which deuterium will be diffused into the coolant. The vacuum
system for the electrode will be designed in accordance with gas
sampling requirements for Subtask 5.1.3.3.
6-38

6.4.7.3 Subtask 5.1.3.3 Determination of hydrogen and its isotopes

In order to evaluate deuterium injection experiments at the CSTF®2 it
will be necessary to distinguish between active protons and active deu-
terons in the melt. Similarly, the measurement of tritons will be
required for later tritium injection experiments and for application

to actual reactor coolants. In conjunction with Subtask 5.1.3.2 (Deter-~ E
mination of protonated species}, the palladium tube electrolysis tech-

nique will be extended to the determination of isotopic forms of hydrogen.

This will be accomplished by applying counting and mass spectrographic »
methods to samples collected in the evacuated palladium electrode. This
approach offers the advantage of specificity and applicability to in-
line monitoring. When an in-line mass spectrometer becomes available,
it will be tested in conjunction with an improved palladium electrode as
a means for providing real time data for isotopic hydrogen measurements.
Also, methods for the in-line measurement of tritium by internal gas
proportional counting in flow-through cells will be studied. A further ee
extension of the application of the palladium electrode will be to
measure elemental hydrogen and its isotopes that are in solution in the
coolant. This can, in theory, be accomplished by measuring the hydrogen
that diffuses into an electrically isclated palladium electrode. The
capabilities and limitations of this approach will be established in
research melts that are subjected to an over-pressure of hydrogen. If
adequate sensitivity can be obtained, this method will be used to
measure the ratio of free and combined hydrogen and its isotopes during
injection experiments at the CSTF.

A predominant fraction of the proton content of the fluorcborate coolant
salt will be present as BF30H , a more stable species that does not reduce
at the palladium electrede. Its potential role in the containment of we

tritium is not thoroughly established. Spectrophotometric evidence has

shown that its proton does not readily exchange with deuterium that is

diffused into molten fluoroborate but that BF;0D is generated by oxida-

tion reactions. It has been suggested that this species could be used a
to retain a major fraction of the tritium that diffuses into the coolant

system. 5" At present the only established method for the measurement of
BFy0H involves the measurement of its infrared absorption at 364L cml, se
usually in a pellet pressed from pulverized samples. This is a lengthy

empirical procedure and an in situ or in-line method would contribute

greatly to the research and development studies on tritium containment. a
Anodic voltammetry will be investigated as a method for the determination

of BF0H . A wave recorded on gold electrodes has been observed to vary

in proportion to the BF3;0H concentration. This wave will be fully char-

acterized and used to develop a method for measurements in the CSTF, Ee

6.4.7.4 Subtask 5.1.3.4 Investigation of redox-buffer couples i
In the reactor fuel, the ust uit couple provides chemical inertia that

will prevent gross changes in redox potential from moderate additions
of oxidants or reductants. To our knowledge no buffer of adequate
 

 

 

6-39

capacity is inherently present in the fluoroborate coolant. The incor-
poration of a suitable redox buffer into this or alternate coolants would
make it possible to achieve better control of corrosivity and, perhaps,
more effective containment of tritium. Voltammetric methods provide a
very effective means for screening candidate redox couples by determining
such properties as standard potentials and reversibility. Voltammetric
studies will be used to characterize suggested redox couples for the
coolant, such as ce*t/Ce3+ and Ti%t/Ti3*. It should also be noted that
the incorporation of a redox couple will permit a convenient measurement
of the redox potential of the coolant.

6.4.7.5 Subtask 5.1.3.5 Development of reference electrodes

 

In electroanalytical measurements it is a distinct advantage to have an
invariant reference potential to which the potential of other electro-
chemical reactions may be referred on a relative potential scale. The
requirements for a reference electrode and problems associated with their
applications to molten fluoride systems are discussed in Subtask 5.,1.1.15.
Reference electrodes are of even more importance in coolant salt systems
than in fuel systems, because at present no suitable reversible couple

is available to serve as a potential marker. Moderate success has been
realized with an Fe/FeF, reference electrode in which the reference
solution (coolant salt saturated with FeF,) is contained in a single
crystal of lanthanum trifluoride. Nernstian response was obtained for
this electrode for EMF measurements on iron (II)/iron concentration cells.
However, occasional cracking of the LaFj crystals was encountered. Con-
sequently, futher efforts will be made to develop more rugged ionic con-
ductors. A practical reference electrode should be of unit construction
and sufficiently rugged to function for in-line situations over extended
periods of time. The present model reference electrode and any future
improved assemblies will be used in the coolant in the CSTF to obtain
practical experience.

6.4.7.6 Subtask 5.1.3.6 Determination of total corrosion products

Controlled-potential voltametry (Subtask 5.1.3.1) provides a measurement
of only the soluble ionic corrosion products. Corrosion products may
also be present as finely divided metals or as other insoluble forms.

A more meaningful measurement of the cumulative corrosion of the coolant
system would include the concentration of these non-ionic species.
Methods will be developed for the in-line conversion of the total cor-
rosion product content of coolant salt to soluble ionic species for
electroanalytical measurement. Both electrolytic and tramspirational
oxidation procedures will be tested. The first such test will probably
be made on isolated test portions of the coolant melt in the CSTF.
6-40
6.4.7.7 Subtask 5.1.3.7 Determination of oxygenated species a

Additional information is needed on the behavior of oxygenated species

in fluoroborate melts. For example, the sclubility of Na,B,Fg0O in the wh
coolant salt is not very well known and an understanding of the equilibria
among the various oxygenated species and the fluoroborate coolant also
awaits further study. Electroanalytical methods will be used to charac-
terize and measure the electroactive oxygenated compounds. Efforts will
also be made to develop an oxide ion specific electrode whereby the oxide
ion activity could be determined from potentiometric measurements.

6.4.8 Task 5.1.4 Effects of radiation on electroanalytical transducers
Electroanalytical transducers will in general be subjected to intense
beta and gamma radiation. Unless experiments to perform measurements
within the core of an experimental reactor are implemented, exposure to
neutrons will be limited to leakage and delayed neutrons and may be neg-
ligible at many locations. The effects of high beta and gamma radiation
levels will be studied to assure that in-line instrumentation will func-

tion properly in the ultimate application. Earlier work has afforded i
only very limited opportunities to test electroanalytical methods in

radiation environments. Measurements of the USH/U*' ratio in a sample

of fuel withdrawn from the MSRE!® tend to support the feasibility of such a
measurements in radioactive environments. However, because of the nec-

essary delays in transfer of the sample to a hot cell apparatus the

activity of the sample had decayed by more than an order of magnitude.

Also, the exposure was, perforce, of brief duration. It will therefore

be necessary to predict areas of potential detrimental effect in order

to design realistic exposure experiments that will establish the magnitude

of these effects. Tentatively, the order of increasing probability of EE
radiation effects would be damage to insulating materials for the pene-

tration of electrode leads into the reactor system, damage to the noble

metal electrodes themselves, damage to insulating materials that are a
exposed to the molten salt streams, and the effects on couples needed
for potentiometric measurements. Separate programs of experimental
exposure will be required in each of these areas.

Penetration insulators which are stable to radiation will be developed
in other phases of the MSBR Program or in other reactor programs. The

only need will be to select from such studies materials that will be g#
compatible with the cover gas of the appropriate salt system and perhaps
perform limited experiments to verify their performance in this
application.

It is not expected that the noble metals will receive sufficient radia-

tion exposure to cause unacceptable modifications of their structural

properties since little stress is anticipated. Surface properties of =
voltammetric electrodes can exert a significant effect on their response

that is not yet fully understood. For example, the operation of elec~

trodes beyond melt limits for even brief periods can distort the shape di

a
 

=

 

 

6-41

of voltammetric waves. In general, the damage from such excursions
"heals" rapidly during normal operation of the electrodes. The continu-
ous exposure of electrode surfaces to beta radiation could provide a
continuous surface damage that would introduce errors if its effect is
not predictable. The effects could, of course, be benign in some cases,
but must be studied before the application of electroanalytical methods
to actual reactor streams. An experimental program will be designed to
determine the effects of radiation on various electrode materials and

to select those materials least subject to damage. Because of the
transitory nature of such phenomena it will ultimately be necessary to
perform exposure tests during measurements in molten salts. Due to the
expense of such experiments, screening tests will first be performed
for various candidate electrode materials by exposing electrodes in
available material test facilities, and then comparing the response of
the exposed electrodes with those of virgin electrodes. Such tests may
eliminate certain materials from further consideration. The remaining
materials will then be tested under conditions of increasing severity
of exposure. The first salt test will be performed in melts to which
radiation energy is added as high~energy alpha emmitters. These tests
will not be realistic but can be performed within convenient alpha
enclosures. Subsequent tests on materials that survive the alpha expo-
sure will be performed with the addition of short-lived beta emitters in
hot cells. Proper functioning during these exposures should be suffi-
cient to establish the applicability to reactor systems. Measurements
under in-pile conditions will be made if possible.

An insulating material which can simultaneously withstand exposure to
salt and radiation would greatly assist the voltammetric measurements.
It is not essential, however, because, with voltammeters of higher cur-
rent capabilities and electrodes of appropriate geometrical designs,
adequate definition of electrode areas can probably be achieved without
insulators. A compatible insulating material will be required for the
development of reference electrodes, however, a program similar tc that
suggested for the study of radiation effects on electrode materials
will be used for the in-stream insulating materials. Work is now in
progress to discover insulating materials of superior compatibility with
non~radicactive molten salts. Those materials that prove suitable for
this application will be screened by fairly simple radiation exposure
tests that will detect deterioration of insulating properties under the
influence of approprate radiation at the temperature of the reactor
streams. Materials showing promise will in turn be subjected to more
strenuous tests to determine whether degradation will occur in molten
salts to which radicactive isotopes have been added. These tests will
be designed to determine whether an increased rate of dissolution or
attack will occur as a result of the absorption of radiation energy.
These tests will serve to select candidates for the fabrication of final
models of reference and specific-ion electrodes for even more rigorous
testing.
6-42

Reference electredes which involve a chemical couple for potential
measurements are possibly the most vulnerable to radiation effects. In
addition to the materials problem that are described above, the intro-
duction of radiant energy at these levels may be sufficient to affect

the chemistry of the reference couples. Normally one would expect the
radiation exposure to merely assure more rapid attainment of equilibrium
potentials; however, at the anticipated radiation levels a steady state
condition that deviates from equilibrium predictions could be generated.
Models of these electrodes will be subjected on a gradient scale to condi-
tions that ultimately approach or exceed those expected in reactor appli-
cations. This will include either in-pile testing in molten fuels or
measurements in fuels that have quite recently been subjected to appro-
priate levels of neutron irradiation.

Wherever possible these radiation-effect studies will be performed in
conjunction with other in-pile experiments that may be carried out by
the Program, which will permit more economical testing and provide more
realistic environments.

6.5 TASK GROUP 5.2 APPLICATION OF SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC METHODS

6.5.1 Objective

The objective of Task Group 5.2 is to develop spectrophotometric methods
that will be useful for the analysis of fuel, coolant, and processing
streams of test, demonstration, and power reactors, and to aid in the
evaluation of the chemistry of such streams. The studies will be carried
out on a schedule that will permit the use of such methods in support of
research and technological studies of the MSBR development program.
Spectral studies have been used to help establish the usefulness of

the voltammetric uranium method, to aid in the identification of chemical
species in molten fluoride salts, and to establish the nature of corrosion
ion solute species.

Such studies, to date, have been on a batch-wise basis with only explora-
tory consideration of in-line analysis. The advent of tunable lasers,
the development of suitable slotted optical probes, and the availability
of experimental salt loops, will accelerate the development of methods
for in-line spectral analysis.

6.5.4 PFacilities

Most of the basic studies and initial development efforts will be per-
formed in existing facilities of rather modest requirements (analytical
laboratories with standard hoods). For work in radioactive melts, space
and facilities are available at the Transuranium Laboratory or the
Analytical Chemistry Hot-Cell Facility in Building 3019. Engineering
installations in which in-line measurements are to be made will also
serve as facilities for this task because the in-line measurements made
therein may uncover practical deficiencies in the methods. In addition,
installations containing large quantities of salt sometimes present
opportunities for stability studies and calibrations that are not feas-
ible in small research melts. Application of in-line spectrophotometric
methods to engineering facilities is expected to be more limited during
the early stages of the Program because the installation of optical
devices will require more extensive modification of the equipment than
will electroanalytical probes. Initial demonstration of in-line spectro-
photometry may be made in the Analytical Test Facility (Task Group 5.6).

6.5.5 Task 5.2.1 Fuel salt analysis

Research and development studies carried out to date have been directed
toward the characterization and identification of solute species of
interest, and to the assessment of the potential of spectrophotometry
for their determinations. These studies have lead to identification of
important solute species, to an understanding of the coordination of
transition metal and actinide ions in these solvents, and to the analy-
tical determination of several solute species, including uranium. A
review of this basic research is given in Section 6.3.3.2. It is ex-
pected that a strong emphasis on fuel analysis will continue throughout
the early stages of the program until materials problems are resolved.
Our earlier work was performed in melts of MSRE solvent composition and
many of our measurements, particularly spectral sensitivities, will have
to be repeated in the thorium-bearing MSBR fuel salt.

It is important to carry out both spectral studies and electrochemical
studies (Task 5.1.1) of solute species in MSBR melts. These two dif-
ferent types of studies augment each other in that they yield mutually
beneficial information derived from different characteristics of the ion
in question. Also, each technique is vulnerable from different inter-
ferences since the measured characteristic is different. Electrochemical
studies are more easily adapted to in-line measurements, but, in general,
they vield indirect or inferred results. Spectroscopy has proceeded, on
an experimental and theoretical basis, to a stage where it can yield
direct results as to the identity, coordination, and concentration of
amenable species (in general, transition metal ions). At the present
state of the art, spectral studies can be carried out on very small
volumes of sample — thus permitting the characterization of rare or
hazardous materials. There are times when a comparison measurement of
both chemical activity, by electrochemistry, and chemical concentration,
6-48

by spectroscopy, would be of benefit. In general, spectral measurements
can be made with more precision so that overlapping absorption peaks can
be resolved; computer techniques can be and have been applied to such
data treatment.

Spectral techniques were applied to samples of fuel from the MSRE to

determine the presence of UST in remelted samples and to demonstrate i
that U3" was formed radiclytically when MSR fuel was allowed to stand

at temperatures below 200°C for periods of days. The measurements were

carried out with great difficulty in a hot cell. Tunable lasers of di
rather wide wavelength are now available, and such measurements will

be much easier. Throughout all the individual spectral studies to be
performed, the application of tunable laser light sources with improved
in-line spectral devices will be evaluated for ultimate application to
the analysis of molten salt streams. As soon as these improved systems
are developed and appropriate modifications are made to technology

facilities, in-line measurements will be started both to provide im- =
proved analytical data and to establish capabilities and limitations

of the method. The requirements for in-line spectrophotometric analyses

will, in general, be the same as those that were delineated for in-line i
electroanalytical measurements (Task Group 5.1) and will not be discussed

in detail in the following subtasks. Spectrophotometric analyses of

discrete samples will continue to be performed when needed by the Lo
Program.

 

6.5.5.1 Subtask 5.2.1.1 Determination of uU3t a

Further evaluation of the spectral determination of U3* will be made
with regard to establishing the sensitivity and molar absorbance index
{A _} of the analytically useful absorption peaks for U3t in MSBR fuel
solvents. Previous work has been done mainly in MSRE type solvents.
The precision of these spectral measurements will be established by
the use of the diamond-windowed spectral cell. Another critical area
of investigation is in the methodology of sample transfer.

 

Previous spectral determinations of ust, in which a sample had to be
transferred from an experimental facility to a spectral cell, has shown
that reliable values can result, but that the transfer is very critical.
This area must be further studied so that the parameters affecting a
sample transfer are clearly defined. A comparison of spectral and

electrochemical results with variation of transfer procedures will be

made. -As a result of these studies, a rather precise procedure for

general sample transfer will be developed.

The absorption peak of U3t at 360 nm is one of the stronger observed
in fluoride melts (A ~ 800). Spectrophotometric measurements could
therefore be competitive with electroanalytical techniques in the
measurement of total uranium in reduced streams of the processing
system. The capabilities of such measurements for the determination Co
of uranium in effluents from reductive extraction processes will be

evaluated.
 

 

6-49

6.5.5.2 Subtask 5.2.1.2 Determination of total uranium

 

The measurement of small variations in the concentration of uranium in
fuel is necessary to ensure nuclear stability in the operation of molten
salt reactors. During the operation of the MSRE, it was demonstrated
that reactivity balance measurements were capable of detecting short
term changes in uranium concentration much more precisely than existing
methods of chemical analysis. In the case of a breeder reactor, however,
concurrent decreases in the concentration of uranium and thorium would
have opposite and cancelling effects on reactivity; moreover, the re-
moval of fission products will complicate the calculation of a long-term
reactivity balance. Thus, the value of reactivity measurements for de~
termining uranium concentration could be compromised and a highly repro-
ducible method will be needed for the direct in-line measurements at the
required precision. Calculations have indicated that in a one-cm path
of fuel the absorbance of the U*t peak in the near infrared (1090 nm)
can be measured with a reproducibility of about 0.1 percent. Absorption
by other ions that have been measured is minimal in this region. The
achievement of such reproducibility would require a precisely defined
optical path that could be cbtained with a diamond-windowed optical

cell or a slotted probe (Subtask 5.2.1.9) and either the oxidation of
all of the uranium to UY" or a correction for the small fraction of

U3" in the fuel. It should be emphasized that the accuracy of these
measurements will depend on calibration and will not necessarily match
the precision.

In theory, the reproducibility could be further improved by at least an
order of magnitude by the use of high-intensity light from a tunable
laser to permit measurements through longer path lengths or by more
precise measurement of transmitted light from an isotopically excited
source. The achievement of the theoretical potential for practical
monitoring systems would require stringent measures to control experi-
mental variables, such as temperature and vibration, and to apply correc-
tions for variations in the concentration of even weakly absorbing ions,
for turbidity, and for effects of melt composition on the intensity of
uranium absorption. With digital data processing and careful design of
transducers such extreme precision appears feasible, and a significant
development effort is justified because of the value of assurance of
fuel stability during reactor operations.

The practicality of high~precision spectrophotometric measurements will
be assessed in more detail by examining measured or predicted spectra
of ions that may be present in sufficient concentration to affect the
measurements at 1090 nm, repeating measurements of the absorption
spectra of selected ions, estimating the effects of turbidity, and
analyzing experiments that are conceived to demonstrate the feasibility
of the method. Until a tunable laser and perhaps an in-line probe are
available, spectral measurements of UY will be limited to basic studies
of changes in intensity of absorption and peak shapes with variations
in composition in the region of the reference fuel mixture. Some of
these data are available from earlier research studies.®% When appro=
priate equipment is available, measurements will be made, probably in
6-50

the Analytical Test Facility, under conditions predicted to yield a
reproducibility of about 0.1 percent. The experimental data will be
compared with the theoretical predictions and any deviations will be
subjected to error analysis. Calculations will then be performed to
predict the requirements for extending the technique to any preselected
level of reproducibility and to estimate the development cost incurred.
On the basis of recommendations from reactor physics and safety groups,

a target precision will be established and the necessary development work
will be performed to provide a device for testing in the GSTF or another
equally appropriate facility.

Other areas where total uranium needs to be determined are in waste and
process streams and in the salt effluent from the fluorination facility.
These measurements are necessary for precise inventory contrel and will
be applied to streams that should contain no uranium or, at most, a very
low concentration of uranium. By making use of a very sensitive ultra-
violet peak of ght, at 235 nm, it should be possible to detect <10 ppm
of uranium. This absorption peak of g4t falls outside the transparency
range of diamond, therefore windowless cells must be used for this appli-
cation. Work directed toward proper cell geometry and assessment of
ultimate sensitivity will be carried out. In the reductive extraction
process streams, small amounts of Ut will be determined, as discussed
in Subtask 5.2.1.1.

6.5.5.3 Subtask 5.2.1.3 Determination of plutonium

 

The spectrophotometry of plutonium compounds in breeder compositions will
be studied to provide data for the development of analytical methods and
to contribute to the basic understanding of the chemistry of plutonium in
this medium. Preliminary absorption spectra for Pu3t in molten fluoride
salts®® exhibit a complex pattern with a wide variation of absorption
intensities. It appears that absorptiometric methods should be feasible
both for the precise measurement of high concentrations of PuFj3 that
would be present during start-up with plutonium fuel and for trace con-
centrations generated by nuclear reactions. There appears to be no
immediate need for in-line analytical methods for plutonium. Basic
studies will be carried out as soon as practical, however, to determine
whether its presence may interfere with the determination of other
constituents.

6.5.5.4 Subtask 5.2.1.4 Determination of protactinium

 

Control of the concentration of protactinium is necessary for attaining
a high breeding ratio in the reactor. The equilibrium level of protac-
tinium will be toc low to be determined in the presence of uranium.
However, the spectral determination of protactinium will be evaluated
for application to salt streams in the processing system which contain
lower concentrations of uranium. Some preliminary spectral studies of
Pa"? have been completed. Based on these studies, it should be possible
to determine Pa*% in processing streams or other fluoride melts of

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

HR

6-51

interest down to a concentration of less than 50 ppm. It may be possible
to extend this limit to lower concentrations as further studies are
carried out. ’

The precision and sensitivity of the spectral determination of Patt will
be evaluated for in-line measurements with improved spectrophotometric
techniques. Capabilities of the spectral methods will be compared with
those of electroanalytical methods in similar applications. A search
will also be made, in melts that are carefully freed of oxide, for
ultraviolet absorption of Pat. Sensitive Pa>t determination would
support basic studies of the chemistry of protactinium.

6.5.5.5 Subtask 5.2.1.5 Determination of UST

The absorption spectrum of UF; has been measured in MSRE fuel solvent. ®’
The spectrum includes a sharp peak at 1465 nm that is sufficiently in-
tense for the measurement of moderate concentrations of Ut in fluoride
melts. The spectrum will be remeasured in melts of breeder composition,
using diamond-windowed cells to provide improved accuracy for absorp~-
tivity measurements. These calibration measurements will be used to
provide analytical support for fuel reconstitution studies. Devices

for in-line measurement will be developed if needed.

6.5.5.6 Subtask 5.2.1.6 Determination of oxygenated species

An understanding of the chemistry of traces of oxide in fluoride melts
is of recognized importance to the stability of reactor streams and to
possible alternate processing schemes. It is probable that oxide can
exist in several forms in the fuels, such as 02™, OH , Mo”, etc. The
complete evaluation of the possible interactions of oxide ions requires
a knowledge of the type of oxygenated species that are present. Studies
in this area could also lead to new analytical approaches to the impor-
tant measurement of oxide activities in MSBR streams. If a strongly
absorbing oxygenated species is found to be in equilibrium with oxide
ions, its measurement could provide the basis for an in-line spectral
method for the measurement of oxide activity. Also, the determination
of trace elements by spectral and other techniques could be affected

by the formation of oxide complexes. The reaction of chromium (VI)

and vanadium (V) with oxide to form the strongly absorbing chromate and
vanadate ions will be evaluated as a method for the determination of
uncomplexed low level 027, or total oxide. The extraction of OH into
molten NaBF, will be studied. Once extracted, the hydroxide will be
determined by the infrared pellet technique (see Subtask 5.2.3.1).
Infrared spectra of oxygen-containing melts will be examined for

useful absorptions. Much of the exploratory work will be done in melts
that contain no thorium so that meaningful standard additions can be
made without exceeding the oxide tolerance. Any promising approaches
will then be studied in MSBR fuels for possible in-line applications.

6.5.5.7 Subtask 5.2.1.7 Measurement of turbidity

Some turbidity is expected in reactor fuel and within other salt streams
of molten salt reactors. Because no provisions for optical observation
of the fuel were available at the MSRE, no estimation of the degree of
turbidity of circulating fuel can be made. It will be necessary to per-
form experiments to obtain estimates of the sources and magnitude of
turbidity so that its effect on spectrophotometric and other in-line
optical methods can be predicted. Alsc, an in-line measurement of tur-
bidity could provide useful information in various areas of reactor
operations. It has been inferred (from the relatively stable concen-
trations of the more noble corrosion products, iron and nickel, in MSRE
fuel that was sufficiently reducing to preclude their presence in ionic
form) that these materials are present as particulate metals of submicro-
scopic size.®® Particles in this size range could cause significant
attenuation in the ultraviolet transmission of the fuel and thus inter-
fere with measurements in this region of highly intense absorptions.
Interference at longer wavelengths with important determinations such

as the precise determination of uranium (Subtask 5.2.1.2) could be in-
troduced by bubbles of helium and graphite particles. If the effect of
turbidity is low, an empirical correction that is correlated with a
measurement of light scatter would probably suffice. More serious in-
terference could be handled either by characterizing the scattering
material and computing its contribution to the attenuation, or by pre-
treatment of the streams to reduce turbidity. This could be accomplished
by filtration, settling, or chemical oxidation.

Many additional benefits could result from the optical characterization
of particulate matter in reactor streams. The most obvious is the direct
measurement of the concentration and size distribution of helium bubbles
to assist in achieving optimum stripping of the high cross-section 135%e,
A rather complete characterization of the total particulate matter in
salt streams would provide a new parameter for the evaluation of reactor
operation. For instance, it could provide early warning of precipitation
of fuel constituents by known or unexpected routes. It should be empha-
sized that since light scattering techniques involve a direct rather than
a subtractive measurement they can be used to provide some of the most
sensitive of optical measurements. The sensitivity is primarily a func-
tion of the intensity of incident light. In a thermally stable medium
such as molten salts, detection limits could be extended to almost any
desired level by using lasers as a source of incident light. A fruitful
area for this type of measurement would be in the study of the generation
of dispersions of bismuth metal during reductive extraction steps of
processing. Lf particulate matter that is originally present in the
entering steam is largely removed by reductive extraction, or if bismuth
particulates possess some optically distinguishable characteristic,
scattering measurements could be applied to a sensitive method for the
essential in-line measurement of bismuth in return streams. Scattering
techniques could readily be applied to the measurement of particulates

in cover gases. In this instance the streams could be diluted to a
concentration that would permit the measurement of scattering by indi-
vidual particles.

Initial turbidity measurements will be made by using the viewing ports
that are to be installed on the salt monitoring vessel of the GSTF.
Although the geometry of this system will severely limit the scattering
angle, these data should be adequate to estimate the order of magnitude
of interference to absorptiometric measurements to be expected from
particulate metals and the relative contribution of helium bubbles to

the turbidity of fuels. When a tunable laser is available, measurements
of scattering at different wavelengths will be used in this facility to
crudely estimate particle size distribution. More definitive experiments
will be made in turn of the size distribtuion of particulate metals that
are generated by the reduction of reseach melts or of the fuel in the
Analytical Test Facility. It is anticipated that a number of more con-
venient and sophisticated devices for particle size classification will
be generated by programs concerned with pollution abatement. These de-
velopments will be appraised for applicability to molten salt measure-
ments. In general, techniques that utilize wavelength and polarization
parameters rather than angle of scatter will be selected because of

their applicability to simplified cell designs. Practical in-line cells
will be developed and used to characterize particulate matter in fuel and
processing streams of various test facilities. From the data obtained,
computer programs will be developed to generate turbidimetric corrections
for spectrophotometric data.

6.5.5.8 Subtask 5.2.1.8 Study of tellurium in fuel

 

On the basis of our present knowledge it does not appear that the concen-
tration of tellurium in MSBR melts will be sufficient for measurement by
spectrophotometric methods. It has been established previously that the
species Tez can exist under isothermal conditions in MSRE fuel solvent
melts.®9 Further studies of this species and of other oxidation states
of tellurium, e.g., Te?~, Te2™, and Tel, will be made in breeder fuel
solvent to establish their possible existence, spectral characteristics,
and solution chemistry. Possible reaction routes leading to the con-
trolled removal of Te3 ions from these melts will alsc be investigated.
This work will be coordinated with basic chemical investigations of
tellurium chemistry (see Section 5) in order to provide analytical
support when needed.

6.5.5.9 Subtask 5.2.1.9 Development of a diamond-tipped optical probe

 

The simplest system for in-line spectral analyses of molten salt reactor
streams would incorporate an optical probe. With proper optical design,

a light beam could be directed into and cut of a molten salt stream through
only one penetration. Light would be transmitted within the probe by in-
ternal reflectance. The probe would be slotted to allow the light beam to
pass through a known length of the molten salt. The probe material must

be transparent, of high refractive index, and compatible with molten salts.
A diamond-tipped optical probe would meet these requirements for the fuel
salt, and studies leading to the fabrication and testing of such a device
6-54

will be carried out. A more detailed description of the principles of
optical probes is presented in Subtask 5.2.3.6.

6.5.6 Task 5.2.2 LiCl analysis

 

Spectral characterizations leading to in-line analytical methods will
ultimately be performed for the various solute species expected to be
present in molten lithium chloride streams of the processing system.

Except for requested analytical support studies, active investigations Ee
in this medium will be deferred because of more urgent problems in other

areas. This should actually lead to more effective utilization of the

research and development resources since research in the less hostile a
chloride media will provide much of the needed data and the analytical
requirements will be more thoroughly established after additional engi-
neering experiments. Spectral investigations will yield the same type
of useful information as direct analyses of solute species in molten
lithium chloride as described in the fuel analysis section (6.5.5,

Task 5.2.1), but with easier application.

6.5.6.1 Subtask 5.2.2.1 Determination of uranium

It is expected that uranium compounds in lithium chloride will exhibit
strong absorptions that can be used to develop in-line methods of com-
petitive sensitivity with electroanalytical methods. The spectra of
uranium in various oxidation states will be characterized to determine
basic chemical data such as coordination, and the applicability of
spectral methods for the in-line monitoring of uranium transfer into
the lithium chloride process streams. 2

 

6.5.6.2 Subtask 5.2.2.2 Determination of plutonium

 

Measurable concentrations of plutonium may enter the lithium chloride
phase particularly during initial processing for a reactor that was
started up on plutonium fuel. It is anticipated that PuClj; will exhibit
a strong and complex spectrum that can prove useful for spectral measure-
ments and may offer interferences to other spectral determinations.
Spectral characterizations of the various stable oxidation states of i
plutonium in lithium chloride melts will be made te assess the potential

for its in-line determination and its effect on other analyses.

 

6.5.6.3 Subtask 5.2.2.3 Study of oxides

 

Significant concentrations of oxide in molten lithium chloride are ex- i
pected to limit the rates of transfer of fission products between

bismuth and halide streams. For this reason, and because oxide may

attack structural materials, the chemistry of oxide in lithium chloride re
will have to be studied. The most promising spectral apprecach will be

 
 

6-55

to search for intensely absorbing oxycomplexes that may be formed by
the reaction of oxide with a solute that is normally present in the
processing streams or with some innocuous added solute. A systematic
survey of the absorption spectra of various solutes in oxide-~bearing
lithium chloride will be conducted throughout the range of spectral
transmission of this medium. The most useful absorptions will be char-
acterized more fully for applications to in-line measurements. If it
proves necessary to add a solute to develop oxide absorbancies, the
stability of this solute in process streams and its potential effect on
the reactor system will be evaluated. The measurement of absorptions
in solid samples will also be investigated.

6.5.6.4 Subtask 5.2.2.4 Study of hydroxide

 

Hydroxide in molten lithium chloride would cause corrosion of structural
metals and many ceramic materials that might be used in the fabrication
of analytical devices. Unless it is continually replenished, it appears
likely that the concentration of uncomplexed hydroxide in chloride
processing streams will be decreased to levels below spectral detection
limits through reduction by the bismuth streams. Therefore, the initial
activities in this task will be directed towards the development of
highly sensitive methods for the determination of hydroxide in samples
of lithium chloride. Methods based on infrared absorption appear to be
the most promising. These will be tested both for the measurement of
hydroxide that has been preconcentrated by extraction into immiscible
NaBF, melts and for the measurement of solid state hydroxide complexes
in pressed pellets. If unusually sensitive solid state absorptions are
discovered, a search will be made in melts for similar absorptions that
could serve as a basis for in situ determinations.

6.5.6.5 Subtask 5.2.2.5 Study of spectra of transition metal ions

 

The spectral characterization of diverse transition metal ions in lithium
chloride melts will provide basic chemical data and information for
possible analytical applications for this medium. It is anticipated that
the intensity of absorptions resulting from d-d transitions will be sig-
nificantly enhanced in this melt; therefore, useful analyses of ions such
as corrosion products will be possible although mutual interferences may
also be accentuated. Because actinides may be present in these process-
ing streams during special operations of the processing system, their
ions will also be measured. Spectral studies will be performed as time
permits of all such ions that may be present in the lithium chloride
streams with particular attention to lower oxidation states. Related
studies by others have been made in similar but not identical melts.
Missing information will be gathered experimentally and an assessment

of analytical capabilities will be made,
6-56

6.5.6.6. Subtask 5.2.2.6 Development of a sapphire optical probe

As described in more detail in Subtask 5.2.3.6, a simple optical probe
would offer significant advantages for practical spectral measurements
in lithium chloride melts. It is expected that synthetic sapphire,
which has suitable optical properties, will be compatible with molten
lithium chloride. Design, fabrication, and evaluation of such a probe
for spectral analysis will be made.

6.5.7 Task 53.2.3 Coolant salt analysis

 

The highest priority for research and development studies under this
subtask will be assigned to the generation of methods to support imminent
experiments at the CSTF that are designed to evaluate the potential of
the NaBF, coolant for the containment of tritium (cf. Task 5.1.3).
Immediate efforts will be concentrated on urgently needed methods for
the spectral analysis of discrete samples rather than the longer term
objective of providing in-line analyses. Priority will also be granted
to spectral support of associated development efforts of other areas of
the Analytical Chemistry Research and Development Program, such as the
identification of condensate from the cover gas of the CSTF {Subtask
5.3.1.3). Information gained in these developments will, in turn, be
applied to in situ studies of proton chemistry in fluoroborate melts

and to the development of in-line methods that will ultimately be needed
for a more efficient analytical system. Other solutes, such as oxide
and redox buffer couples, of possible significance to tritium contain-~
ment will be studied on a lower priority basis. When alternate coolants
are proposed, spectral methods will be applied to generate basic chem=-
ical data on solutes in these materials and to provide any needed
analytical support for their evaluation.

6.5.7.1 Subtask 5.2.3.1 Determination of BF30H and BF30D

 

The present analytical investigations indicate that the major fraction
of combined hydrogen in NaF-NaBF, coolant melts is present as the rela-
tively stable BF30H ion, typically in concentrations of about twenty
ppm as hydrogen. In the reference reactor design this concentration
corresponds to a quantity of hydrogen that is comparable to the total
tritium production during the operating lifetime of an MSBR reactor.
Therefore, it will be of major interest in the deuterium injection
experiment at the CSTF to determine whether deuterium, a stand-in for
tritium, can be incorporated into the hydroxyfluoroborate ion. The only
established method for distinguishing between hydrogen and deuterium in
this compound is the infra-red pellet technique. ’9 At present, the
detection limit (established by standard additions of NaBF 30H) is about
one ppm. Essentially identical sensitivities are predicted’® for the
measurement of BF30D . At least an order of magnitude improvement in
detection limit will be needed to evaluate the results of the deuterium

 

 
Sn

 

 

6-57

injection experiments. The use of thicker pressed pellets will be in-
vestigated as a means of improving the sensitivity of the infra-red
method. These development studies will also provide verification of

the calibration for BF3;0H measurements because standard additions of
deuterated compounds can be made without contamination. The techniques
developed will also be used in support of basic chemical studies on the
control of BF30H concentrations in melts. Studies of the direct infra-
red measurements of these ions in melts will be resumed to evaluate this
approach for the development of in-line analytical methods.

6.5.7.2 Subtask 5.2.3.2. Determination of oxide

 

Uncomplexed 02~ ion may not exist in NaBF,. Many oxides, however,
readily dissolve in this melt and the nature of the dissolved oxide
species must be characterized in order to assess their effect on
corrosivity and possible modes of tritium transport through the coolant
salt. For these types of studies, infrared analyses of molten and selid
NaBF, will be used to establish the molecular species that are present.
Similar investigations will be performed on alternate coclant composi-
tions which may be proposed during the course of the program.

6.5.7.3 Subtask 5.2.3.3 Determination of protonated species in
alternate coolants (AC)

 

 

As other coolant melts are developed to an experimental stage, an assess-
ment of their interaction with tritium escaping from the fuel salts will
need to be investigated. These considerations will require a knowledge
of the type and concentration of protonated species that are present in
the melt. Molecular spectroscopy, using infrared or near-infrared
measurements, will be applied in these studies. Recent research’! has
shown that infrared measurements can be used to measure complexes of
anions including hydroxides with di~ and trivalent cations at ppb con-
centrations. This solid measurement technique will be applied to the
characterization and determination of protonated species in the new
coolants, and possible extensions to direct measurements in melts will
be studied. Methods developed in this subtask will be used to provide
analytical support for experiments to study the exchange capabilities

of protonated species with deuterium or tritium.

6.5.7.4 Subtask 5.2.3.4 Determination of corrosion product ions

 

Earlier investigations of typical corrosion product ions, such as Fe2t,
NiZt, and Cr3 , have shown that their absorbancies are too weak for
profitable exploitation for in-line analytical methods in the present
MSBR coolant. Also, in the NaBFy coolant the solubilities were too low
to permit proper spectral characterization. It is assumed that the
spectra will be similar in alternate coolant compositions provided they
are made up of fluoride salt mixtures. Spectrophotometric studies will
6-58

be needed for these ions and those of other components of structural
alloys to provide basic chemical information and to predict possible
interferences with other spectral determinations. Characterization of
these species will be made in melts of proposed alternate coolants.

Also, the spectra of certain fuel constituents will be studied for poten-
tial application to the detection of leaks in heat exchangers during
periods of initial non-nuclear operation. ed

6.5.7.5 Subtask 5.2.3.5 Study of redox buffer candidates

For any MSBR coclant salt it will probably be desirable to incorporate
some type of redox buffer system to control corrosion or assist in
tritium containment. In general, these redox couples will involve multi-
valent solute species of transition metal ions, and one or both of the
oxidation states will be amenable to spectral determinations. Spectral
studies of proposed redox couples will be made to characterize the nature gi
of both solute species and to assess spectral methods for an in-line

determination of the redox condition of the coolant.

6.5.7.6 Subtask 5.2.3.6 Development of an optical probe for
coolant salts

 

The application of spectrophotometric methods to molten salt streams

can be performed much more conveniently if both the entrance and exit

beams can be conducted through a single penetration. For this purpose, Ei
a simple optical device has been developed that is generally applicable

to all fluid streams for which a suitable optical material exists.3

The optical material must be compatible with the fluid to be measured -
and must have a higher refractive index. The device is fabricated from

a cylindrical section of optical material for convenient sealing into

the system. Facets ground onto the external end of the material direct

a collimated beam of light (typically from a tunable laser) along a

longitudinal path in the probe and provide an exit window for the

attenuated exit beam. A prismatic configuration at the immersed end

cf the section reverses the direction of the beam by total internal i
reflection. A slot of appropriate length, cut to intercept one of these
light beams, contains the fluid and provides an invariant path length
for absorptiometric measurements. This device was conceived when it was
found that single crystal lanthanum fluoride — an optical quality
material available in massive shapes — was a suitable window material
for spectrophotometric measurements of at least limited duration in
fluoroborate coolant melts. Plastic mockups of such a device have been wa
tested with aqueous systems and found to give accurate absorbance measure-

ments. More recently, slightly more complex designs have been conceived

that will effect simultaneous measurements of absorption and scattering. a
Composite modifications will permit use of smaller quantities of optical
materials (see Subtask 5.2.1.9, Development of a diamond tipped optical
probe}. Lanthanum fluoride is being obtained to fabricate a probe for
tests in molten coolant salts. These tests will provide information for
general use of this technique in coolant salt streams.

6.5.8 Task 5.2.4 Effects of radiation on optical components
and spectra

 

Many of the in-line spectrophotometric measurements for an MSBR will be
performed in the presence of intense beta and gamma radiation and perhaps
moderate neutron fluxes. It was demonstrated by measurements of remelted
MSRE samples that meaningful spectral information could be obtained for
highly radioactive molten salt samples; however, because of unavoidable
delays, the activity of these samples had decayed to a level at least

two orders of magnitude below that anticipated during in-line applica-
tions. Methods for the elimination of the possible interference from
Cherenkov emissions will be established for these applications. The
possibility that other optical emissions can be stimulated by the intense
radiation in the fuel will also be considered. Should such emission be
possible it will be evaluated as an interference to analytical methods,
and then studied further as a separate investigation for possible ana-
lytical usefulness in the area of general or specific fuel characteriza-
tion. Measurements will be made of transient and long-term effects of
radiation on the transmission of diamond windows that will be used for
the most precise measurements (cf. Subtask 5.2.1.2). Less rigourous
measurements will also be made for other proposed optical components
including other probe and window materials and materials for containment
windows. Those materials that will be exposed to the salt will be

tested under simultaneous exposure to both radiation and molten salts.
Some of these studies may be carried out in conjunction with tests of
insulating materials for electroanalytical measurements. Effects of
radiation on optical sources and detectors will also be evaluated. It

is planned to use collimated beams from tunable lasers so that these
components can be located outside areas of intense radiation; however,
close mechanical coupling of optical elements may be required to minimize
vibration effects.

The capabilities of spectral methods for measurement of minute samples
will be used to study the effects of radiation on the chemistry of fuel
melts. Such measurements will be needed to predict effects on in-line
analytical determinations by spectral and other techniques and will pro-
vide basic chemical information. Initially, the spectra of small samples
that are spiked with radioactive isotopes will be measured. Later
attempts will be made to measure spectra in molten fuel in which realistic
fissioning levels are generated either by external or internal neutron
sources. Neutrons could be generated internally by interaction of the
beryllium with high energy alpha particles, or perhaps by the addition
of californium. Particular attention will be given to the effects on
couples that will be involved in potentiometric measurements with
reference electrodes.

6.6 TASK GROUP 5.3 ANALYSIS BY CHEMICAL METHODS

6.6.1 GObjective a

The objective of this task is to assure that the required chemical analysis

methods are available to the Program when needed and to develop in-line

chemical methods that will be essential to reactor operations. For the sa
examination of discrete samples the definition of chemical methods as

"methods in which the sample is altered by a chemical reagent" will be

arbitrarily extended to include analytical procedures in which the samples ES
may be subjected to analysis by diverse physical techniques such as X-ray
diffraction and fluorescence, emission spectrography, and various spectro-
physics approaches. Except for unusual circumstances, the actual perfor-
mance of service analyses will not be an objective of this task group.
Rather, the task group will provide liaison between users of analytical
services and the service laboratories in order to promote the optimum
selection of methods. Exceptions will include applications im which fii
unique competences may exist within the Analytical Chemistry Research

and Development Group and occasions in which onsite analysis can be

performed more efficiently by group members. Task Group 5.3 will not a
include measurement performed on remelted samples. Such applications

will be handled under the preceding tasks.

Operating fund requirements for this task group are shown in Table 6.6.3.1,

6.6.4 Facilities

With the exception of limited expansion into conventional laboratories,

no need for additional facilities is anticipated for Task Group 5.3

activities. Rather, the extensive facilities available at the Oak Ridge -
Complex will be utilized. Limited usage may alsc be made of facilities

at the University of Tennessee with which the Laboratory maintains a

close working relationship.

6.6.5 Task 5.3.1 Analysis of discrete samples

 

The need for analyses of discrete samples will continue throughout the
Program and, indeed, will persist even for the most completely instru-
mented operating reactor. A wide variety of analytical techniques have ”
already been applied to samples from the Program.’ The status of such

methods will be surveyed at intervals and a close liaison will be main-
tained with experimental investigators so that any required development
work can be carried out in anticipation of needs. Also, a surveillance
of new developments in the technology of analytical chemistry will be
maintained to uncover approaches that could yeild superior or more eco-
nomical analyses of MSBR samples. Promising advances will be submitted

to appropriate methodology groups for development or, when desirable, i
will be actively develeped as a part of Subtask 5.3.1.6. Another re-

sponsibility inherent in this subtask will be to provide a disinterested

third party on occasions when analytical results do not appear consistent wi
with experimental operations. In many cases this activity will be limited
to advisory actions, but may include performing the sampling and analysis
operations or developing new methods. An essential part of this work will
be to validate or improve methods for taking and preparing representative
samples for analysis.

6.6.5.1 Subtask 5.3.1.1 Determination of bismuth

 

Because of the potential damage to structural materials by trace concen-

trations of bismuth transferred to the reactor via processing streams,
extensive research and development studies will be carried cut to develop
methods of limiting such transfer. Methods of adequate sensitivity have i

already been developed to support such studies. An unacceptable scatter
has been experienced in the analytical data obtained during efforts to
megsure the solubility of bismuth in fuel salts. Since the concentrations
measured are below one ppm, the errors could readily have been introduced
by the entrainment of particulate bismuth during sampling or by contami~
nation introduced during sample preparation and dissolution. The entire
sampling and analysis sequence will be examined, when such experiments
are re-initiated, to locate possible sources of contamination and to
determine whether some unexpected interference could have contributed

to errors in the analysis. Remedial action will be recommended and
appropriate procedures will be developed for the sampling and analysis

of fuel salts for bismuth determination.

 

6.6.5.2 Subtask 5.3.1.2 Determination of oxide

 

Because trace concentrations of oxide can cause precipitation of fuel Ge
constituents, an accurate method for the determination of ppm concentra-

tions of oxide will be used extensively in research studies to determine

the tolerance of fuel for oxide and for determining the status of fuel

in engineering test facilities. The KBrF, method will be used for the

determination of oxide in discrete samples. Recently, the method was

improved to permit measurements to the 10 ppm level, a sensitivity suf-

ficient for the anticipated requirements of fuel analysis. Sample con~- a
tamination by atmospheric constituents is a severe problem due to the
small, typically 200 mg, pulverized samples that are used for the analysis.
Work in this subtask will be directed to the elimination of contamination
during the sampling sequence. Improvements in the quality of dry box

 
 

6-65

atmospheres are being made by the service groups and experiments have
been designed to determine the magnitude, and source of contamination
during sample preparation and transfer to the analytical apparatus. When
these experiments have been completed and corrective action has been
taken, similar experiments will be designed to study contamination during
the withdrawal of samples from experimental facilities. An investigation
of possible segregation of oxide during freezing will also be carried
out, and criteria for the pulverization required for representative
sampling will be established.

6.6.5.3 Subtask 5.3.1.3 Identification of condensate from the
cover gas of NaBFy

 

An oily condensate has been collected from the cover gas of engineering
test facilities for the evaluation of NaBF,-NaF eutectic as a coolant.
Elemental analyses of this condensate are consistent with the presence

of hydrolysis products of BF3, but are not definitive. It has been shown
that the condensible species is in equilibrium with active protoams in

the melt, and evidence exists that the material could serve as a vehicle
for collecting tritium that diffuses into the coolant system.’?2 The
identification of the individual compounds in this condensate is needed
to assist in the understanding of the chemistry of protonated species

in molten NaBF, and to design experiments to evaluate the potential of
this coolant salt for tritium containment. Diverse chemical and physical
methods such as NMR and infrared methods will be used to establish the
composition of the condensate. Efforts will also be made to identify

its precursor in the gas phase using either direct infrared measurements
possibly with Fourier-transformed spectrometry or measurement of the
spectra of matrix-isolated condensate. Once identified, the gases and
condensed species will be compared with a synthetic material of similar
properties that can be generated by the reaction of boron trifluoride
with water. If these materials prove identical, the synthetic products
will be used to establish analytical methods for the quantitative collec-
tion of condensate, its in-line measurement, and the conversion of its
hydrogen content to the elemental form for isotopic analysis. Methods
developed in these studies will be used at the CSTF in support of the
Deuterium Injection Experiment to determine the potential of NaBF, for
tritium containment.

6.6.5.4 Subtask 5.3.1.4 Determination of tellurium

 

Materials studies have indicated that tellurium is, at least in part,
responsible for the intergranular cracking that was observed in Hastelloy
N during operation of the MSRE. Concentrations of tellurium in the low
ppm range will be present in fuel salts to which metallurgical specimens
are exposed. Methods will be developed for the determination of tellurium
at the required concentration levels. Atomic absorption, perhaps with
pre—-concentration, is the most likely approach for such determinations.
6-66

6.6.5.5 Subtask 5.3.1.4 Precise determination of uranium

Methods of high precision will be needed to detect variations in the
concentration of uranuim in the fuel that could be of significance to
reactor operation (see Subtask 5.2.1.2}. Such methods must be adaptable
to remote determinations, because of the radioactivity of the samples,
and be accurate to better than 0.1 percent. During the operation of the
MSRE, it was shown that uranuim could be quantitatively volatized as UFg
from 50 gram samples of the fuel, and the resulting UFg could be decon-
taminated and collected for isotopic analyses that are performed cutside
the hot cell. It was calculated that an isotopic dilution method could
yield accuracies approaching 0.0L percent. The achievement of such
accuracy would require equivalent precision in the addition and thorough
mixing of a predetermined quantity of another uranium isotope to the
fuel sample. Such an isotopic addition is feasible but will require
extreme care in hot cell operation. Techniques will be designed to
precisely weigh a fuel sample, make an isotopic addition, melt and
homogenize the sample (possibly with hydrofluorination), and separate

a representative sample of the isotopically diluted uranuim for ratio

measurements. Equipment to accomplish these operations will be assembled

and tested in a hot-cell mockup.

6.6.5.6 Subtask 5.3.1.6 Development of special methods

This task will be devoted to the resolution of any special problems in
the sampling and analyses that remain unresolved from previous studies
or that will arise in the course of research and development studies for
the Program. One known problem of this type is the separation of suffi-
cient quantities of particulate matter, iron and nickel, from fuel for
characterization. The identification of the nature of such material
could assist in thermodynamic predictions of equilibrium conditions

and resolve anomalies that have been observed earlier in the Program.

6.6.6 Task 5.3.2 In-line chemical methods

 

Because of the nature of the application, in-line analysis of salt streams

by chemical methods will usually be limited to transpiration techniques;
that is, the introduction of a reagent as a dilute solution in an inert

gas stream followed by measurements on the effluent gas or, in some cases,
in the effluent salt by transducers described in the previous task groups.

Other methods of reagent addition, such as in a stream of salt or a
bismuth alloy, will be considered, but such approaches appear cumbersome
for high-temperature application. Transpiration methods will be closely
related tc developments in Task Group 5.4, Analysis of Gas Streams.

 

 
 

6-67

6.6.6.1 Subtask 5.3.2.1 Metering of salt flows

 

The chemical methods will, in general, measure an extensive property of
the molten salt as opposed to intrinsic measurements performed by electro-
chemical or spectrophotometric methods (Task Groups 5.1 and 5.2); there-
fore, a measurement of the quantity of salt subjected to analysis is
required. This could be accomplished by analyzing discrete samples that
are temporarily isolated from the streams, but this would not permit con-
tinuous measurement which may be required in some applications. Methods
will be developed for the metering of small flows of molten salt, and it
is estimated that flow rates of 2 to 3 ml per minute will be optimum for
many of the analyses. Flow metering might be accomplished by passive
fiow elements such as capillaries or orifices, but in view of the uncer-
tainties in wetting properties of the salts, a positive pumping action
would appear more reliable. Aqueous mockups of various conceptual de-
signs of salt pumps will be tested. These will include simple mechanical
devices, such as bucket lifts, an archimedian pump, and a pump utilizing
liquid bismuth valves. Final testing of workable devices will be done

in the Analytical Test Facility.

6.6.6.2 Subtask 5.3.2.2 Determination of oxide in fuel

 

A continuous surveillance of ppm concentrations of oxides in the fuel

salt of a reactor may be required. While it is anticipated that more
convenient methods will be devised for determination of the concentration
of soluble oxide ion (Subtask 5.1.1.10), a chemical method would be needed
to determine total oxide in the event that tolerance levels are exceeded.
Work will be initiated for adapting the hydrofluorination method for oxide
analysis!! to continuous in-line measurements; the extent to which the
necessary development work will be carried out will depend on the success
of developing alternate oxide analysis techniques, and determination of
the necessity for continuous oxide analysis. Aqueous mockups of a system
to deliver metered salt flows to a countercurrent hydrofluorination columm
will be tested. The results of these tests will be used to provide design
criteria for the Analytical Test Facility. Experimental investigations

in this facility will be used to develop a practical in-line system, which
will then be used to monitor oxide in the GSTF or other appropriate
facilities. Consideration will alse be given to the measurement of oxygen
or oxygen fluorides in the gas from the fluorinators of the processing
system in order to provide an alternate measurement of oxide.

6.6.6.3 Subtask 5.3.2.3 Determination of reducing power in fuel

 

Reducing power or reducing normality, the measurement of the hydrogen
liberated on dissolution of fuel samples in HCl, was the original method
used to determine the oxidation state of discrete samples. An equivalent
in-line determination together with a U3t determination would provide
information on the total quantity of particulate metals in the fuel and
contribute information on the redox potential in an experimental reactor.
6-68

The apparatus for the determination of oxide could readily be converted
to incorporate a reducing power determination. The substitution of
precious metal components and the use of HF-helium mixtures in place of
HF-hydrogen would lead to the oxidation of the particulate metals. A
measurement of hydrogen in the effluent gas would then complete the
determination. Such a procedure would also provide an effluent stream
of oxidized fuel that can be used to measure total quantities of indi-
vidual corrosion products by electroanalytical methods (see Subtask
5.1.1.7, Determination of total corrosion products). Rate data for the
estimation of needed countercurrent hydrofluorination conditions will
be established by measurements of the hydroflucrination of isolated
samples of fuel from the GSTF. The extent to which work in this subtask
will be pursued will depend upon a continuing analysis of the necessity
of determining fuel reducing power.

6.6.6.4 Subtask 5.3.2.4 Study of transpiration of bismuth

 

The in-line measurement of bismuth in the return stream from the proc-
essing system will require quantitative oxidation of entrained bismuth
and bismuthide to the trivalent state. A study will be made to determine
whether finely divided bismuth can be oxidized by a countercurrent hydro-
fluorination technique. It has been noted that bismuth trifluoride
slowly disappears from research fuel melts in contrast to other ions
which are quite stable. This phenomenon may reflect the volatility of
bismuth trifluoride under these conditions, and, in fact, a recent re-
port shows that solid BiF; has an appreciable vapor pressure at reactor
temperatures.®® Studies (Subtask 5.1.1.3) now in progress will determine
whether the loss of bismuth is through volatilization. If so, the dis-
tribution coefficient between fuel and cover gas will be determined, and
the possibility of using a transpiration method for isclating BiF; for
measurement will be investigated. Final determination of the bismuth
could be made with high sensitivity by atomic absorption, or perhaps by
advanced infra-red techniques, Thus, a single apparatus could provide
gas streams for the measurement of oxide, total reducing power, and
bismuth trifluoride, and a salt stream for the measurement of total
concentrations of corrosion products and possibily bismuth.

6.6.6.5 Subtask 5.3.2.5 Determination of reducing power in

bismuth alloys

 

At present, both the reference and alternate flowsheets for fuel proc-
essing include reductive extraction with lithium-bismuth alloys for
separation of the rare earth elements. A measurement of the total re-
ducing power of bismuth streams based on hydrofluorination could provide
data required to maintain alloy concentrations at optimum levels. In
conjunction with other analytical techniques, this method could alsc be
used to measure the concentration of the individual metals in the alloys
and thus detect undesirable accumulation of a particular metal such as
iron. Measurement of the hydrogen generated by the hydrofluorination of

 
 

 

6-69

a small side stream of bismuth alloy under conditions at which negligible
oxidation of the bismuth is incurred would provide a sensitive measure

of the total equivalents of oxidizable alloying constituents. Performing
the hydrofluorination in contact with a metered stream of purified LiF-
BeFy would provide a salt stream containing proportional concentrations
of the alloying constituents including thorium, for measurement by
electroanalytical or spectrophotometric methods.

Basic studies will be performed to determine the conditions under which
pure bismuth, in contact with LiF-BeF,, can be contacted with HF in an
inert gas without generating unacceptable quantities of hydrogen. If
such conditions cannot be established, trace additions of hydrogen will
be incorporated into the sparge gas to determine whether the oxidation
of bismuth can be suppressed without compromising the measurement of
hydrogen generated by the oxidation of alloying constituents. Oxidative
hydrofluorination of representative metals from bismuth alloys will then
be studied using the best compromise gas mixture as a transpiration
reagent. Much of this basic information will result from other research
and development activities of the Program.

The basic data will be used to design experiments to demonstrate the
feasibility of the approach and to establish its capabilities and limita-
tions for in-line measurement. This will prchably require the construc-
tion of a modest facility utilizing gravity-fed streams. The extent to
which work in this subtask will be pursued will depend on the success

in developing simpler alternate analysis techniques.

6.6.6.6 Subtask 5.3.2.6 Determination of oxide in coolant salts

 

The role of oxide in the present NaBF,-NaF coolant salt is not yet fully
understood. The oxide tolerance is apparently quite high; concentrations
in excess of 2000 ppm have been measured in filtered samples from research
melts to which oxide has been deliberately added. Also, it has been sug-
gested®" that substantial concentrations of oxide can exert a benign
effect by contributing to the sequestering of tritium that diffuses from
the primary system. It is, therefore, not certain that an in-line method
for oxide in fluorcborates will be essential to reactor operations. How-
ever, an in-line method might be more economical in the long run because
induced activity in the samples will probably be sufficient to require
expensive hot-cell analyses of discrete samples. Also, much of the basic
studies needed for an in-line method would be applicable to analysis of
individual samples.

A hydrofluorination method will be the first choice for testing. The
initial investigation will have to be indirect because BF3 in the effluent
gas will interfere with established methods for measurement of the "water"
generated by the hydrofluorination of oxide. Accordingly, melts con-
taining readily measurable concentrations of oxide will be subjected to
hydrofluorination by HF in a stream of helium that contains an equilib~-
rium concentration of BF;. Estimation of reaction rates will be made by
6~70

measuring the decrease in oxide concentration by the KBrF, method. (N.B.
It is not, at present, considered practical to adapt the versatile KBrF,
method to the analysis of highly radicactive MSBR samples. To avoid
contamination during transfer, it would be necessary to perform the
measurement within an inert atmosphere hot-cell. This concept was ex-
amined during the development of the analytical chemistry program for

the MSRE and found to be exorbitantly expensive and subject to potential
safety hazards). If the rate of hydrofluorination of oxides proves too
low for analytical applications, stronger oxidants, such as fluorccarboms,
will be tested in a similar manner. When an effective reactant is dis-
covered, methods will be developed for the measurement of oxygen-bearing
products in the transpiration effluent under Task Group 5.4. In the
case of fluorocarbon oxidation, infrared techniques will be tested for
the determination of expected constituents such as CO and COF,. For
hydroflucrination effluents, methods developed under Subtask 5.4.3.3
will probably be applicable because the oxygen is expected to be incor-
porated in the protonated species. Data from these studies will be used
to design a countercurrent transpiration system that will be functionally
similar to that used for the measurement of oxide in fuel. This system
will be tested in the Analytical Test Facility after fuel tests are
completed or by using salt streams from the CSTF.

6.6.7. Task 5.3.3 Effects of radiation on chemical methods

 

It is not anticipated that significant problems will be encountered in
the use of chemical methods for the analysis of discrete samples. The
intensity of radiation experienced in such measurements will in general
be reduced to more tolerable levels by the use of small or diluted
samples and by the decay that will occur during transfer to hot cells.

In the analysis of MSRE samples neo degradation of precision and accuracy
was observed that could not be attributed to problems of remote handling.
New technology in remote analysis will be incorporated as it is available
into the already developed methods for these radioactive samples. Any
additional developments will be based on established principles to limit
radiation effects and the new methods will be verified by standard addi-
tion techniques.

For in-line chemical methods, which will usually be based on transpiration
techniques, the gaseous reactants and products will be subjected to at
least transitory exposure to intense radiation. It is planned whenever
possible to conduct the reactants to analytical transducers that will be
located outside the area of highest radiation intensity. This may not

be possible in the case of products whose absorption in gas lines would
impose prohibitive time lags on the measurement. Even momentary exposure
to the radiation fields could cause sufficient radiolysis of the reactants
and products to compromise the analytical measurements; also, the tran-
spiration streams could carry fission product gases and particulate radio-
active matter to the analytical transducers. In cases where established

G values are available, the effects of radiolysis will be estimated. If
radiolysis effects are unacceptable, corrective measures will be taken.

 

 
fe

6-71

Analytical transducers will be modified to eliminate materials that are
known to be sensitive to radiation. Models of the analytical devices
will be tested under simulated exposures that will include the transpira-
tion of spiked salt samples and the addition of fission product gases

to the transpiration streams. More realistic testing will be carried

out under in-pile conditions if other activities of the program present
an opportunity.

6.7 TASK GROUP 5.4 ANALYSIS OF GAS STREAMS

6.7.1 Objective

The objective of this task is to assure that gas analysis methods will

be available when needed for reactor applications and for the research

and development studies of the program. Needed determinations will include
atmospheric contaminants, H,, HF, Fp, UFg, fission product gases, BFj

and its hydrolysis products, and tritium. As in the previous task group
(Analysis by Chemical Methods) this activity will not be of a predominantly
innovative nature. Many commercial instruments are available that can

be used directly or with modifications for these determinations. It is
anticipated that improved instrumentation will become available as a

result of pollution control developments. To achieve this objective it
will be necessary to maintain a surveillance of developments in the gas
analysis field so that appropriate instrumentation can be recommended.
Whenever possible, equipment that can ultimately be adapted to MSBR
applications will be recommended for research and development activities

of the Program. This will provide practical experience and limit eval-
uation of alternate equipment.

6.7.5 Task 5.4.1 Analysis of fuel cover gas

 

Purified inert gas will be used to protect both the coolant and fuel
from exposure to atmospheric constituents and to remove fission product
gases from the fuel in an MSR. Both the purification and analysis of
helium were successfully performed at the MSRE and no significant ana-
lytical development is anticipated for these operations. The determina-
tion of residual atmospheric gases, gases desorbed from the graphite
moderator, tritium, and possibly the isotopic composition of fission
gases in the off-gas from the fuel system will be required. Suitable
commercial analyzers exist for these determinations but may not be
universally applicable because of the radioactivity in the gas stream.
Limited in-line methods were applied to fuel off-gas during the MSRE
development and operation. A gas chromatograph that utilized a helium
break-down detector sensitive to sub-ppm concentrations of inorganic
gases was successfully applied to the analysis of off-gas from in-pile
fuel capsules.*® No evidence of radiation interference was encountered
but the instrument is not expected to be reliable for long term usage.
Simple devices involving thermal conductivity cells were used to deter-
mine the general purity and hydrocarbon content of cover gas from the
MSRE. Methods for cryogenically collecting fission product gases for
isotopic measurement were developed. Tritium was also collected for
counting outside the reactor area. The devices used for these measure-
ments are not considered adequate in both sensitivity and long-term
radiation stability for reactor applications and improved devices will
be developed during the course of the Program to meet reactor require-
ments.

6.7.5.1 Subtask 5.4.1.1 Development of gas chromatographic methods

 

Gas chromatography is one of the more versatile tools for in-line gas
analysis. However, the more sensitive detectors generally utilize ijoni-
zation phenomena and will thus be subject to severe interferences at the
anticipated levels of radiation. One solution is to concentrate the
impurities by cryogenic trapping and utilize thermal conductivity cell
detectors. This solution, however, would decrease the frequency of
analyses and require the use of liquid nitrogen in intense radiation
fields. Therefore, a search for more sensitive detectors which are not
affected by radiation will continue. Efforts will be made to discover
the reason for the sporadic unstable response of the helium break-down
detector, and modifications of an ultrasonic detector will be made to
eliminate materials that are subject to radiation damage. This latter
device could also serve as an improved katharometer in instruments for
the measurement of specific constituents or groups of constituents in
Subtask 5.4.1.3. Gas chromatographic sampling valves are also generally
subject to radiation damage because they contain elastomers which would
degrade under the anticipated radiation exposure and generate radiolysis
products that could interfere with the determinations. An all-metal,
pneumatically actuated sampling valve was developed earlier. The valve
is, however, rather complex and expensive and can easily malfunction if
6-76

contaminated by particulate matter. A novel concept that utilizes
fluidic control principles will be investigated. A chromatograph that
utilizes radiation-resistant components and inorganic absorption columns
will be developed and tested on the cover gas of the GSTF. Application
to radiation environments will be demonstrated subsequently in Task
5.4.4.

6.7.5.2 Subtask 5.4.1.2 Development of in-line mass spectrometric
methods

Quadrupole mass spectrometers can be installed near sources of gas samples

and could supplement and perhaps replace gas chromatographs in many ana-

lytical applications. They will be particularly valuable for the measure- =

ment of deuterium-to-hydrogen ratios when deuterium is used to study the

containment of tritium. An instrument that most closely meets the antic-

ipated requirements for the program will be selected and interfaced to da

gas streams of the GSTF. An additional analyzer head will be purchased

for applications to the CSTF.

6.7.5.3 Subtask 5.4.1.3 Development of specific constituent monitors

 

 

Many analytical gas devices have been developed for the measurement of
individual constituents or classes of compounds that may be present in
fuel cover gas streams. Such devices, which include nondispersive infra-
red equipment, various forms of moisture monitors, and newly developed &
solid state detectors, will be tested for providing measurements of
improved sensitivity or as back-up methods for the most important de-
terminations. A particular class of specific ion monitor is based on

the thermal conductivity cell. The measurement is related to the change
in the thermal conductivity of gas streams that results from the subtrac-
tion or alteration of a constituent or class of materials by trapping or

by chemical reaction. It is not expected that thermal conductivity cells Es
will provide sufficient sensitivity for most of the required measurements

of the program. If, however, an ultrasonic detector can be adapted to

this type of measurement, z class of devices that would provide continuous i
measurement of most of the constituents of interest could be developed.

Systems based on this detector will be developed with regenerable traps

and chemical reactants for long term usage.

6.7.6 Task 5.4.2 Analysis of gas streams from the processing system

In-line analyses of gas streams of the processing system will provide a
means of controlling certain processes and for indicating the operaticnal
status of parts of the system. In general, the required determinations
can be performed by established methods in devices which can be located
outside areas of intense radicactivity. The methods that are tentatively
proposed for such application are outlined below.

 
 

 

Ro)

6-77

6.7.6.1 Subtask 5.4.2.1 Determination of UFg

 

Measurements of UFg would be made in the effluent gas from the fuel
reconstitution system. Uranium that escapes hydrogenation could be
temporarily excluded from the reactor systems and thus effectively reduce
the breeding ratio. The intense absorption of UFg in the ultraviolet

has been used to measure concentrations at the ppm level. Practical
investigation including the selection of compatible window materials will
be performed to develop in-line instrumentation for this and similar
streams. Such methods will be tested in the Integrated Process Test
Facility or in support of earlier development activities.

6.7.6.2 Subtask 5.4.2.2 Determination of HF

 

HF in varying concentrations will be present in processing streams and
perhaps in the cover gas of the fuel system. During operation of the
MSRE, a method was developed for the determination of traces of HF in

the fuel off-gases.’3 This method was based on the depolarization of

an aluminum anode and utilized an aqueous absorber which would probably
be undesirable for use with reactor processing streams. Infrared absorp-
tion methods will probably be satisfactory for the measurement of HF in
the overhead of the distillation section of the HF recycle system. Infra-
red methods could alsc be applied to the determination of HBr and HI in
this stream. Practical in-line absorption cells will be designed and
tested for this application. A method developed to measure micromolar
quantities of HF that are generated during the transpiration of fuel with
hydrogent!?3 will be used if more sensitive measurements are needed.

6.7.6.3 Subtask 5.4.2.3 Determination of F,

 

In-line determinations of fluorine will be useful in controlling the
operation of the fluorinator section. The sample input to the analytical
system will be a binary mixture of fluorine and an inert gas. The
fluorine can then be readily determined with a thermal conductivity cell
or a gas density balance. The precisions and lifetimes of such devices
in this application will be evaluated. For excess fluorine in the ef-
fluent, ultraviolet absorption methods will be used, with preconversion
to chlorine if additional sensitivity is needed. A practical in-line
cell will be developed for this measurement and the interference of other
components of this stream will be evaluated.

6.7.6.4 Subtask 5.4.2.4 Analysis of H,-HF mixtures

 

The in-line measurement of the composition of the effluent gas from the
fuel reconstitution system will assist in the achievement of more effi-
cient reduction of UFg. The concentrations of H, and HF can readily be
measured with thermal conductivity cells. Components that provide long
lifetimes in this application will be selected.
6-78

6.7.7 Task 5.4.3 Analysis of coolant cover gas

 

As with previous tasks related to coolant studies, priority will be
granted to the development of methods for the coolant system in order

to provide amalytical support for the Deuterium Injection Experiment.

It is expected that in-line gas analytical devices in reactor applica-
tions will not be subjected to significant radiation exposure and, there-
fore, more conventional insulating materials such as Teflon can be used.
The work in this task will be associated initially with the measurement
of hydrogen and deuterium and later with tritium. If a fluoride salt is
chosen as an alternate coolant the methods developed for the fuel cover
gas (Task 5.4.1) are expected to be equally applicable to the cover gas

streams of the coolant system.

6.7.7.1 Subtask 5.4.3.1 Determination of elemental hydrogen isotopes

In order to interpret the results of experiments on the diffusion of
deuterium into the coolant salt it will be necessary to measure H,/D,
ratios and ultimately to measure the ratios of free te combined hydrogen

and deuterium in the cover gas streams.

A method based on the diffusion

of hydrogen through a heated palladium membrane inte an evacuated system
appears to be the most promising approach for the measurement of hydrogen
isotopes that are present in the cover gas. When equilibrium is attained,
the partial pressures of the elemental hydrogen will be equal on both
sides of the membrane. The measurement of pressure developed within the
evacuated system thus provides a sensitive determination of the concen-
tration of hydrogen within the gas stream. The hydrogen will also be in
a suitable form for the measurement of isotopic ratios. A system has
been fabricated which has a resistance-heated tube of silver-palladium
alloy as a diffusion membrane. Recently, commercial equipment to accom-~
plish similar separations has become available. The separation system

or its commercial equivalent will be tested with simulated cover gas
streams to which standard additions of deuterium and hydrogen have been
added. The most successful device will be used to provide measurement

in the off-gas of the CSTF. Initially,

isotopic measurements will be

made on samples collected for mass spectrometric methods. When a mass
spectrometer becomes available it will be coupled with the diffusion
system to provide real time data. A swept diffusion system will also be
developed to effect in-line measurement of tritium by internal gas pro-

portional counting.

6.7.7.2 Subtask 5.4.3.2 Identification of hydrogen compounds

This activity is closely associated with Subtask 5.3.1.3, Identification
of condensate from the cover gas of NaBF,. It has been definitely estab-
lished that at least one condensible species is in equilibrium with active
protons in fluoroborate melts. Evidence has alsc been obtained that
tritium is present in much greater concentration in the condensate than

in the salt from which it was derived.

The identification of the hydrogen

GE

 

 
 

6-79

compounds in the cover gas, which are tentatively postulated to consist
of hydrates of boron trifluoride, will be of considerable value in
establishing the chemistry of protonated species in the fluoroborate
melts and in identifying a possible mechanism for the collection of
tritium. Since rather complex equilibria are expected to be established
in the liquid condensate, direct measurements in the vapor phase must

be used for unambiguous identification. Attempts will be made to measure
infrared absorptions of the volatile species at their low concentrations
in the CSTF cover gas and in simulated cover gas streams that are pro-
duced by mixing boron trifluoride and water in varying proportions and
under diverse conditions. Mass spectrometric methods will be used to
examine these simulated cover gases. Matrix-isolation condensation will
also be used to collect samples of the protonated species for infrared
examination.

6.7.7.3 Subtask 5.4.3.3 Determination of hydrogen compounds and
distribution of isotopes

With data on elemental hydrogen concentrations from subtask 5.4.3.1, the
measurement of the combined hydrogen and deuterium in the CSTF cover gas
will permit the calculation of ratios of free to combined hydrogen and
deuterium. These ratios will be needed to evaluate the effectiveness

of fluorcborate coolant for tritium containment. The measurement of the
increase in concentration of elemental hydrogen that results from the
in-line reduction of cover gas streams will reflect the concentration

of combined hydrogen. Various in-line reductants including NaK and
heated magnesium will be tested for quantitative liberation of elemental
hydrogen. The hydrogen in the reduced streams will be determined by
means of the palladium membrane technique which will also permit the
measurement of hydrogen—-to-deuterium ratios in the hydrogen that is
liberated from these compounds. The possibility of distinguishing be~-
tween different hydrogen compounds by a sequence of reactions with
selectively stronger reductants will also be studied.

6.7.7.4 Subtask 5.4.3.4 Development of in-line mass spectrometric
methods

A heated interface fabricated from materials such as nickel that are
expected to be compatible with the constituents of the CSTF cover gas
will be used to introduce samples of the gas to the resolving head of

a quadrupole mass spectrometer. This system will be used to test the
feasibility of the measurement by mass spectrometry of the various con-
stituents that were measured by specific constituent monitors developed
in the above subtasks. An additional sample inlet will be provided to
permit the measurement of isotopic ratios in the hydrogen that is sepa-
rated by the palladium membrane analyzers.

6.7.8 Task 5.4.4 Effects of radiation on gas analysis equipment

Whenever possible the gas analytical equipment will be located outside
areas of intense radiation to minimize radiation effects. In the case

of trace element measurements this may not be possible because of the
excessive time constants of the sample transfer lines. Experimental
measurements of time constants for the transfer of simulated gas streams
of all expected types will be made to determine which analyzers must be
located close to the sample source. All possible means, such as heated
transfer lines of selected low absorbing materials, will be used to
minimize the time constants. As noted in Subtask 5.4.3.1, the analytical
equipment, even in optimum locations, can receive significant radiation
exposure from fission product gases and particulate radioactive material.
This exposure will be most significant in the analysis of gases from the
fuel and from the fluoride streams of the fuel processing system. The
use of filters to exclude particulate matter and thus simplify maintenance
will be evaluated. Models of analytical equipment that have bbeen modi-
fied to minimize radiation effects will be tested under exposure at
appropriate radiation levels. Industrial radiography sources will be
used to simulate external exposure and synthetic samples generated by the
addition of fission product gases will be used to study the effects of
internal exposure.

6.8 TASK GROUP 5.5 MEASUREMENT OF FISSION PRODUCTS AND PROTACTINICM
BY GAMMA SPECTROMETRY

6.8.1 Objective

The objective of this activity is to develop methods for the direct meas-~
‘urement of the distribution of fission products and protactinium by gamma
spectrometry. The deposition of certain fission products in reactor
components is of major interest te reactor safety and operations. The
in-line measurement of certain fission products and protactinium in salt
streams would contribute to the evaluation of the operation of the proc-
essing system. A wealth of information was obtained by gamma scans
during the latter periods of MSRE operation. This task group will be
devoted to the fullest possible exploitation of this technique.

6.8.2 Schedule

Ther schedule for work in this task group is shown in Table 6.8.2.

6.8.3 Funding

The operating fund requirements for this task group are shown in Table
6.8.3. Capital equipment funds will be required in the amounts of $50,000
and $30G,000 during FY 1981 and FY 1984, respectively, for purchase of
equipment for development of gamma spectrometry techniques.

6.8.4 Facilities
No additional facilities will be required for this activity. Existing

6.8.5 Task 5.5.1 Evaluation of method

 

A variety of fission products were located and identified on surfaces of
MSRE components by using a system comprised of a lithium-drifted germanium
detector, a 4096 channel analyser, and a lead collimator to permit exami-
nation of small areas, Much valuable quantitative and qualitative infor-
mation was obtained on the deposition of fission products on major com-
ponents and on the distribution of fission product gases in the system;
but some problems in the interpretation of data were encountered, partic-
ularly for scans made during full power operation.’% These problems were
generated by the multitude of overlapping photopeaks of short-lived
isotopes for which adequate energy characterizations were unavailable

and the inability of the computer program to resolve the large number of
higher order (greater than triplet) multiplets that were found in the
spectra. Since significant concentrations of 233pa were not present in
the MSRE, the experimental data does not permit evaluation of the poten-
tial of this technique for its measurement. The technique, in its present
state of development could probably be used to measure the simpler com-
binations of isotopes that will be present in some of the processing
streams, With improvements in resolution it could supply continuous data
that would contribute to the safe and efficient operation of an MSBR.

6.8.5.1 Subtask 5.5.1.1 Evaluation of MSRE data

 

The data obtained by gamma scans of MSRE components will be reevaluated
by using an updated library of isotopic spectra and any improved computer
programs for the resolution of gamma spectra that may become available.
From predictions of delays in transport and from chemical resolution

data that will be generated by other research and development activities
of the Program, the abundance of radioactive isotopes will be computed
for significant leocations within the primary and processing systems of

an MSBR. These computations will, in turn, be used to generate synthetic
spectra emitted from these selected areas and predict benefits that could
be expected from instrumentation of improved resolution.

6.8.5.2 Subtask 5.5.1.2 Evaluation of advanced equipment

 

Data derived from the preceding subtask will be used to assess the value
to reactor monitoring of any technological advances in high-resolution
gamma spectrometry. The most suitable combination of detectors and
analysers will be selected and acquired for experimental applications.
6-84

6.8.6 Task 5.5.2 In-pile activation experiments

 

In-pile activation experiments will provide a variety of information
that is relevant to general applications of gamma spectrometry, but will
be designed primarily to assess the potential of the technique for the

monitoring of protactinium — a determination that may tax the capabilities

of other in-line methods. The experiments will, in general, involve the
measurement of spectra of simulated fuel samples after neutron irradia-
tion, but may also be extended to include the characterization of emis-

sions of critically interfering short-lived isotopes that can be generated
by various available methods of activation. Fuel irradiation experiments

will progress from the recording of gamma scans from small fuel samples
subjected to brief irradiation in an analytical activation facility (to

measure photopeaks and decay rates of short-lived primary fission products)
to long-term irradiation of capsules of molten or solid fuel at realistic

fluxes in a research reactor (to generate measurable levels of 233pg).
If the detector system can be sealed for underwater operations, measure-~
ments immediately after withdrawal can be made conveniently at the ORR.
Sufficient measurements will be taken to determine the decay period
required to permit the measurement of protactinium over the range of
required concentrations. Supplemental data on the relative affinity of
individual fission products can be gained by performing the experiments
with capsules fabricated from composite materials or with capsules con-
taining metallurgical specimens.

6.8.7 Task 5.5.3 Selection and design of equipment for reactors

Components of experimental and power reactors that will require continuous

or intermittent gamma surveillance will be identified through consulta-
tion with other disciplines of the Program. From computations and ex-
perimental data, specifications will be prepared for transducers for

measurements at each of the required locations. Since requirements of
spatial and photopeak resolution will vary widely, performance specifi-
cations for each measurement will be determined individually and will

generally involve a compromise of resolution capabilities and practical

considerations such as reliability, coolant requirements, and adaptability

to remote maintenance. Appraisal of new developments {(Subtask 5.3.1.2)
will be continued to assure optimum selection of equipment. Each device
will require a complex and expensive installation; therefore, the use of
a single transducer device for intermittent monitoring of different com
ponents will be utilized when practical. Gimbal systems for the precise
aiming of the massive collimating and shielding assemblies will be de-
veloped or submitted to vendors.

If it proves impractical to measure protactinium at essential locations
with the decays inherent in transport of fuel through the processing
system, the concept of delay lines will be explored. A delay line would
consist of a parallel stream of salt in which the flow is restricted

to delay the arrival of fluid to the point of measurement by a period
sufficient to permit decay of interfering isotopes.

6.9 TASK GROUP 5.6 IN-LINE ANALYTICAL TEST FACILITY

6.9.1 Objective

The objective of this activity is to perform the necessary conceptual
design and development studies for the Analytical Test Facility, to
provide the guidance and direction that will be needed to design and
fabricate the facility which will deliver representative molten=-salt
streams of controlled composition to experimental analytical devices,
and to utilize the facility to perfect these analytical devices. As
this will be a unique facility of the Program, efforts will be made to
incorporate capabilities that will permit other applications such as
basic chemical studies for measuring reaction rates in MSBR melts.

6.9.2 Schedule

The schedule for work in this task group is shown in Table 6.9.2.

6.9.3 Funding

Operating fund requirements for this task group are shown in Table 6.9.3.
Capital equipment funds in the amount of $100,000 will be required during
FY 1976 for design and construction of the Analytical Test Facility.

6.9.4 Task 5.6.1 Conceptual design and definition of experimental
program

 

This activity will be directed to the complete delineation of the capa-
bilities that will be needed to evaluate the performance of various in-
line analytical transducers in terms of reliability, reproducibility,
time constants, and effect of variables such as temperature, flowrate,
etc. Presently, it appears that these requirements will be best ful-
filled by a small pumped system that will deliver gravity-fed and/or
pressurized salt streams to transducers for electroanalytical, spectro-
photometric, chemical, and special methods developed in Task Group 5.7,
and conform to additional requirements as follows. The salt capacity,
typically < 20 Kg of fuel, will be adequate to provide chemical inertia
against gross changes from the introduction of trace contaminants but
small enough to permit ease in making adjustments in composition.
Materials that contact the salt will be limited to noble metals such

as copper and nickel to permit stable operation with relatively oxidiz-
ing melts. Most of the above and many other features were incorporated
in an earlier design’® that utilized a gas 1ift instead of the proposed
mechanical pump.

The considerations leading to the initial design will be reviewed to
determine what additional capabilities will be feasible with increased
pumping capacity and what may be needed for the more complete evaluation
of in-line analytical devices. Consultations will be held with other
potential users of the facility to determine other needed capabilities

that can be incorporated, and with materials, mechanical, and safety

specialists to evaluate the practicality and cost of various features

of the facility. Data gained in these activities will be used to develop »
the conceptual design for a versatile system that will incorporate per- =
formance, dimensional, and materials specifications.

6.9.5 Task 5.6.2 Development work required for final design

The testing of transpiration equipment is expected to impose the most wi

critical requirement for salt streams delivered by the Analytical Test
Facility. Most of these requirements (adequate pressure and space for
metering systems and countercurrent comtactors) will be established by
mock up studies performed in Task Group 5.3. Any additional definition
of these requirements and those for the installation of other types of
transducers will be made by additional mock-up studies. Questions rela-
tive to the circulating system itself such as mixing times and effects a
of dead volumes, will be resolved by experiments in glass or plastic

models of sections of the system. Data acquired will form the basis

for specifications for the final design of the facility. ”

6.9.6 Task 5.6.3 Final design

 

 

Assistance will be provided as necessary to design engineers in order to
expedite the completion of an optimum design. This will include modifi-
cation of specifications to conform to practical considerations, and the
collection of information for the preparation of documents required for
approval of construction.

 

6.9.7 Task 5.6.4 Fabrication, installation and initial testing

As soon as the final design of each subsection of the facility is com- Ei
pleted and approved, materials will be ordered and fabrication started

in order to complete the installation during FY 1977. Initial testing

will be performed by circulating aqueous solutions or some other liquid &
that matches the rheological properties of molten fuel salt. These tests
will include the calibration of the volumes of various vessels and
verification of flows calculated from design specifications. Flow tests
of the more complex transducers will be performed concurrently.

6.9.8 Task 5.6.5 Operation i

 

The facility will be charged first with purified MSBR carrier salt and

used to test transpiration devices, particularly the one designed for Gi
the determination of oxide. Oxide will be adjusted by standard addition
to concentrations both above and below precipitation levels. Later, the
oxide will be removed by hydrofluorinaticn and similar tests will be
performed after addition of UF; to determine effects of this less~
soluble oxide. The facility will have the capability of delivering

 

 
6-89

several salt streams for the concurrent testing of different devices.
Because many of the tests require the addition of constituents that
cannot readily be removed from the salt, a careful sequencing of ex-
periments will be required to achieve effective and economical utiliza-
tion of the facility. Accordingly, long-term schedules will be devised
to perfect analytical devices and accommodate the experiments of others
in the most efficient sequence that is consistent with the needs of the
Program. When applications to fuel salts have been exhausted, modifica-
tion to permit usage with NaF-NaBF, or an alternate coolant will be made,
and a similar but briefer program will be started. It is not expected
that the same facility can be adapted to molten lithium chloride. Rather,
a more modest facility will be assembled from ceramic materials, if
necessary.

6.10 TASK GROUP 5.7 SPECIAL STUDIES

6.10.1 Objective

The objectives of work in this task group are fourfold: first, to develop
and assess the value of methods which, by virtue of their advanced nature,
or multidisciplinary character, cannot be logically assigned to any of
the previous task groups; second, to perform experiments to which spe-
cialized analytical capabilities are peculiarly suited; third, to
automate analytical methods and the acquisition and processing of data
through the use of digital computers and to apply developed methods in
support of activities of the Program; fourth, to select a rational
combination of in-line and discrete-sample analytical methods that will
assure optimum chemical surveillance of experimental and power reactors.
Predicted activities in this task group are described in the following
subtasks. It is expected that some expansion of special studies, par-
ticularly in the areas of the first objective, will result from new
technological developments in analytical chemistry.

6.10.5 Task 5.7.1 Special electrochemical investigations

The predominant electrochemical method used to date for molten-salt
research and development studies, particularly for in-line applications,
has been linear-scan voltammetry. Considerable effort has been devoted
to developing suitable instrumentation and electrode combinations for
these studies. Successful measurements have been made on electroactive
species at the ppm concentration level. Problem areas, however, still
remain. For example, suitable insulating materials which are compatible
with molten fluorides would allow a more precise definition of electrode
area and a corresponding improvement in the precision of the measure-
ments. The search for better insulators will continue. As it becomes
necessary to extend the electrochemical methods to lower concentration
levels, particularly in relation to Task 5.2.2 (LiCl analysis), other
electrochemical techniques will be investigated. Among these will be
stripping techniques and pulsed techniques. The present instrumentation
can be utilized in many instances for dc stripping applications; however,
instrumentation for pulsed techniques will have to be developed. Com-
mercial instrumentation for the latter which is suitable for in-line
molten salt analysis is presently not available. Studies will be made
to establish suitable guide lines for the fabrication of such electro-
chemical instrumentation. This will be followed by an evaluation of
prototype instruments as applied to research melts and in-line appli-
cations,

6.10.5.1 Subtask 5.7.1.1 Pulsed techniques

The feasibility of applying pulsed techniques to molten salts has been
demonstrated.’® In this technique, a square wave or sine wave of small
amplitude (millivolts) is superimposed on the voltage ramp that is
applied to the indicator electrode. The attractive features of pulsed
techniques are the increased sensitivity over limear-scan voltammetry,
the ability to measure the Faradaic current in the virtual absence of
charging current, and presentation of the current in the form of a
symmetrical peak rather than the usual waves cbtained with linear-sweep
voltammetry. Pulsed techniques allow precise measurement of the peak
height and exact location of the peak potential. Instrumentation for
pulsed techniques requires various timing and sampling circuits,
low-drift analog memories and good low-drift differential amplifiers.
Satisfactory component parts are presently available; however, commer-
cial instrumentation that can be used for research studies and in-line
measurements in molten salts is not. Studies will be continued to
establish suitable criteria for prototype instruments. Evaluation of
such instruments will be made on both research melts and in-line situ-
ations involving fuel and coolant salts and also for measurements in
molten LiCl.
6-94

6.10.5.2 Subtask 5.7.1.2 Stripping techniques

 

The electroanalytical stripping method, in which the current required to
remove an electrolytically deposited product is measured, is a powerful
technique for increasing the sensitivity and sometimes the selectivity

of electroanalytical measurements. Improved sensitivity results from

the fact that the quantity of deposited product, typically a plated

metal, increases with plating time. Since the integrated current re-
quired to oxidize the metal is proportional to the equivalents deposited,
much greater signals than obtainable by direct voltammetry can be produced
by applying an anodic potential scan to an electrode that has been plated
for extended periods. For direct current stripping, the most well-defined
waves and highest sensitivities are obtained when the stripping voltage is
increased at reasonably fast rates so that peak-shaped curves are obtained.
In the pulse stripping mode, all of the considerations for dec stripping
techniques apply. However, the far greater sensitivity and signal proc-
essing capability of the pulse detection technique yield cumulative
improvements. Another valuable application of stripping techniques is

in the measurement of a platable metal in the presence of another con-
stituent which is reduced to a soluble species at a similar potential.
Because the soluble species diffuses from the electrode, its reoxidation
wave does not increase significantly with plating time, and after extended
depositions the platable ion contributes a dominant signal to the stripping
wave. This technique has been used to record measurable chromium waves in
simulated MSRE fuel melts that contained a voltammetrically overwhelming
concentration of UF,.%%

It is evident that stripping techniques will be needed to achieve the
required sensitivities for the measurement of trace constituents, par—
ticularly bismuth at ppb levels. Enhancement of sensitivity has been
demonstrated in quiescent research melts that contained a single platable
ion. The application of stripping techniques to circulating melts in
loops has been found subject to complications. At elevated temperatures,
interactions (tentatively designated as alloying) frequently occur be-
tween different deposited metals or between a deposited metal and the
noble-metal electrode. Alloying can generate complex stripping patterns
that cannot, as yet, be interpreted quantitatively. Also, even moderate
salt flow rates can increase plating rates significantly and thus compro-
mise quantitative measurements. Conversely, selective alloying can
sometimes be used to resolve closely spaced stripping waves.

A comprehensive program of theoretical and experimental studies will be
undertaken to increase the understanding of practical aspects of stripping
methods in molten fluoride media, and later in LiCl. Investigations
will include the study of the stripping of co~deposited materials from

a variety of electrode materials, the use of vibrating or rotating
electrodes to minimize the effects of variations in flow, and consulta-
tions with materials specialists for understanding of alloying phenomena.
Pulsed stripping techniques will also be investigated when appropriate
instrumentation is available. The results of these studies will be used
to effectively exploit stripping techniques for the in-line measurement
of traces of metallic ions in MSBR melts. The use of stripping methods
to study the alloying of noble-metal fission products with structural
metals will be evaluated.

6.10.6 Task 5.7.2 Special optical methods

 

The activities of this task will be devoted to utilizing the in situ
capabilities of spectrophotometric methods, and optical methods in
general, (see Task 5.2.1) for special studies on MSBR melts. Included
in these studies will be application of established spectral methods to
investigation of significant chemical questions in radioactive fluoride
melts and the assessment of the value of advanced techniques. As these
latter techniques have had only limited application te fluoride systems,
preliminary evaluation must be largely based on applications reported
in other media.

6.10.6.1L Subtask 5.7.2.1 Investigation of radiolytic oxygen removal

The concentration of oxide determined in the MSRE fuel prior to criticality
was about 100 ppm; after criticality and throughout the rest of MERE oper-
ation the concentration was approximately 50 ppm. The higher initial
value may well be attributed to errors in sampling and analysis, but the
stable levels during operations must be considered as significant. On

the basis of estimates’’ of the quantity of oxygen entering the system
during maintenance, an 86 ppm increase in oxide concentration would have
been expected — a value readily detectable by analysis. One hypothesis

is that the oxide was converted by a radiolytic process either to the
element or gaseous compounds, such as CO and COp, which resulted in re-
duction of oxide concentrations to steady-state or limiting levels.

Below a critical temperature, radiolytic fluorine is liberated from solid
fuels. Above this critical temperature the rate of recombination with
reduced species in the fuel exceeds that of radiolysis and fluorine
evolution ceases.’® For the less electronegative oxygen, a higher crit-
ical temperature is expected, perhaps above the reactor operating temper-
ature. The verification (and quantification) of this "self cleaning"
hypothesis would have favorable implications to the inherent stability of
molten-salt fuels.

A simple test of this hypothesis will be made by using internal alpha
sources as a stand-in for in-reactor irradiation. The apparent relative
solubility or rates of solution of oxides of isotopes of widely differing
specific activities will be measured. Candidate compound pairs include
244Cm,03 and 248¢m,04, and 238py0, and 2%2Pu0,. Individual compounds

will be added to oxide-bearing melts of MSRE fuel solvent in the presence
and absence of graphite. Radiolytic remcval of oxide will result in the
more rapid dissolution of the more active compound as evidenced by growth
of its absorption spectrum, and perhaps changes of its spectrum as soluble
oxycomplexes, such as PuO?t are converted to fluorides. If positive re-
sults are obtained, more advanced experiments will be made in MSBR carrier
salt with gas-analytical capabilities for the measurement of radiolysis
products.

The initial work will be, in part, supported by the basic analytical
research program in transuranium chemistry and will utilize Transuranium
Research Laboratory facilities.

6.10.6.2 Subtask 5.7.2.2 Investigation of laser Raman spectra

The use of Raman spectroscopy for the study of polyatomic species in
ionic melts is well established.’%:8C By using "windowless" optical
cells, this method has been extended to molten fluecrides for the char-
acterization of the BeF,2~ ion®! in molten Li,BeF, and other melts, as
well as the Be, Fy 3- ion and higher polymers of beryllium fluorides. ®2
Quite recently®? Raman spectra of melts containing AlFy at temperatures
up to 1000°C have been obtained using a very simple experimental appa-
ratus. Spectra of AIF,” and AlFg3- ions were well defined; effects of
changing melt composition, temperature, and Al,03 content (0.5-2.5 mole %)
were investigated. At the present stage of development, the method is
primarily useful for the characterization of pelyatomic ions at concen-
tration levels as low as 0.1 mole % or less when one of the elements
involved has a high atomic number. In the MSR Program, Raman spectroscopy
will be useful for the characterization and analysis of beryllium=,
boron-, thorium~, and some uranium-containing species in fuel and coolant
melts. If the resonance Raman effect is observed, much lower concen-
trations can be determined; for example, it was possibled® to obtain

the resonance Raman spectrum of v0, 2 ion at concentrations of <60 ppm

in molten LiCl-KCl. The laser Raman approach is particularly attractive
because it is the only technique which offers promise for the in-line
determination of major constituents of the fuel solvent, such as BeF,

and ThF,, °

A systematic investigation of laser Raman spectra of fluoride melt com=
positions of interest to the MSBR Program will be undertaken with empha-
sis on quantitative aspects. Absolute accuracy of better than 0.5%
should be feasible with modern instrumentation. Analytical procedures
for the in situ determination of total uranium, beryllium, thorium, and
plutonium will be developed. This work will be accompanied by studies
of minor constituents, possibly some oxygenated species in the coolant
salt and lithium chloride, as well as protactinium and tellurium in the
fuel salt. In addition to the development of analytical procedures, the
Raman studies will result in increased understanding of the structure of
melts of interest to the MSR Program.

 

6.10.6.3 Subtask 5.7.2.3 Time-resolved Raman spectroscopy

 

The major remaining problem in Raman spectroscopy is elimination of
fluorescent background. 8° This problem may be acute in the detection

of ‘a weak Raman feature of colored or impure samples, and must be solved
before the simple Raman techniques used for the characterizations of
major polyatomic constituents in melts will become generally applicable
to the determination of minor constituents. In a potentially successful
approach, 8° a pulsed laser excitation source is used to achieve temporal
resolution between the short-lived Raman signal (vibrational lifetimes
on the order of 10713 to 107%! sec) and the relatively long-lived
fluorescence signal (fluorescence lifetimes on the order of 1079 to

10-7 sec). Further development work is necessary before this approach
is routinely applicable in Raman spectroscopic studies. The application

 

 

 

 

 
fn

 

 

6-97

of this approach to studies of ionic melts and other systems where fluo-
rescence is a serious problem will be investigated. This subtask will
be initiated shortly after proving the utility of Raman spectroscopy

for the quantitative determination of major polyatomic species in melts
of interest to the MSBR Program. Improvements in the precision of
measurement of major species and in the detection limits for trace
constituents will be evaluated.

6.10.6.4 Subtask 5.7.2.4 Infrared emission spectra

 

Determination of infrared spectra in addition to the Raman spectra is
required in order to understand fully the interionic interactions in
ionic melts containing polyatomic species. In addition to a more com-
plete understanding of the structures of these melts, new and improved
analytical procedures for certain polyatomic species should result from
the measurement of infrared spectra of melt constituents. Complete
characterization of major polyatomic constituents of melts by a combina-
tion of Raman and infrared measurements could fill a final gap in analyt~
ical capabilities by providing at least an indirect method for the
estimation of lithium and fluoride concentrations.

Recently, 86 infrared emission spectra of molten nitrates and chlorides
were obtained with a Fourier transform spectrometer (FITS). This approach
eliminates the necessity for contacting the melt with an optical material.
With the FTS, either the spectra can be recorded quite rapidly or the
results of many scans can be readily averaged using an on-line computer
which is part of the FIS. It is also possible to detect dissolved species
in low concentrations when they exhibit strong infrared bands in a
spectral region that is not overlapped by bands of the solvent.

The work will involve the development of techniques suitable for molten
fluorides and fluoroborates. In the latter case, the volatility of the
melt will have to be taken into account. After characterization of
species present in melts of interest to the MSR Program, the development
of analytical procedures for desired major species and the extension of
this work to minor constituents will be undertaken. Fourier transform
infrared spectra of gaseous constituents in equilibrium with fluorcborate
melts will also be obtained. These results should be of considerable
value for complete understanding of the chemistry of coclant melts.

6.10.6.5 Subtask 5.7.2.5 Radioisotopic light sources

 

Optical radiation generated from radioactive sources can be measured with
high and predictable precision by photon counting techniques and the
application of counting statistics. A theoretical and experimental
application of this principle to improved photometric analysis has been
developed using beta-activated scintillators as light sources.

Recently, in basic analytical research on transuranium chemistry, it

was discovered that crystals doped with o-emitters can function as iso-
topic light sources at temperatures at least as high as 500°C. Such
6-98

sources would be ideally suited for precise absorptiometric measurements
of optical radiation of predictable intensity that can be generated close
to the point of measurement. Moreover, these sources exhibit sharp peaks
in intensity that would aid in discrimination against radiation from the
melts themselves. Basic research in the study of these high-temperature
sources, in part supported by other analytical research programs, will

be supplemented by conceptual designs and experimental models of devices
to exploit this phenomenon. After such devices are evaluated in applica-
tions to non-radicactive streams of the Program, the effects of radiation
on the sources will be evaluated, both for the generation of extraneous
emissions and for damage to the crystal structure of the phosphors.

6.10.6.6 Subtask 5.7.2.6 Optoacoustic methods

 

The optoacoustic method is a new and powerful concept for gas analysis
based on the fact that radiant energy absorbed by constituents of a gas
mixture is usually converted to thermal energy in the gas phase. During
transmission of modulated monochromatic radiation, thermal expansions
from selective absorptions by constituents are converted to sonic signals
of intensity directly proportional to the concentration of the absorbing
species. By using laser sources, sensitive microphones, and computer
processing of signals, this technique has been used for a commercial
instrument that will automatically measure up to 10 atomospheric con-
taminants at ppb levels at five minute intervals.®% Methods based on
this principle would be of great value to the multicomponent analysis

of MSBR gas streams, particularly coolant cover gases, but would require
development of compatible optical and acoustical components. The
potential of applications in this area will be evaluated from gas
absorption data generated by other subtasks. Devices for its appli-
cation will be developed, either as new instruments or as modifications
of commercially available equipment.

6.10.7 Task 5.7.3 Spectroelectrochemical studies

 

In order to understand the chemical nature of melts of interest to the
MSBR program in both a thermodynamic and kinetic sense, the nature, sta-
bility, and mode of formation of various oxidation states of solute
species in these and related salts must be known. Electrochemistry
provides a clear and relatively efficient means to generate various
oxidation states of species of interest. This is an indirect technique,
however, in that the identity of the product species can only be inferred
and even then the inference can only be made when the electrochemical
reactions occur under conditions dictated by the medium of measurement,
e.g., voltammetric melt limits. Conversely, spectral techniques can be
used to characterize species that can be generated with low current
efficiency or in a transient state outside useful electrochemical limits.
Spectroscopy is a direct technique for identifying species in that the
theory is reasonably well advanced so that the identity, coordination,
and oxidation state of amenable dissolved species can be derived from a
given absorption spectrum. The simultaneous use of electrochemistry

and spectroscopy in a given experiment, therefore, can yield considerably
more information than either technique will yield when used alone.

6.10.7.1 Subtask 5.7.3.1 Characterization of unusual oxidation states

 

A knowledge of the basic chemical characteristics of all possible oxida-
tion states of many solutes that will be present in fluoride and chloride
melts is needed to predict reactions that may occur during operation of
molten—salt reactors. Spectral examination of electrochemically gener-
ated species in higher and lower oxidation states than are thermodynam-
ically stable in MSBR streams has been demonstrated to be a useful tool
for such studies.®? This technique will be used to characterize possible
unusual oxidation states for various transition ions including corrosion
products, lanthanides, transuranic elements and certain nonmetallic
elements such as iodine and tellurium. Measurements of transuranic
elements will also be supported by another program for basic analytical
research. When necessary, measurements will be made in other molten

salt media; e.g., KHF,, to obtain sufficient stability for complete
spectral characterization. Studies of the less-stable species in MSBR
compositions will be performed in the following subtask.

6.10.7.2 Subtask 5.7.3.2 (Characterization of transient species

 

This subtask is closely related to the previous subtask and to various
tasks associated with the effects of radiation on analytical methods.

In the chemistry of radioactive MSBR salts many unstable and, therefore,
transient species can be postulated. In the fissioning process very
strong transient oxidants are formed, for example, a fission product
nucleus stripped of a large fraction of its electrons. Also, the number
of valence electrons of nonnuclear constituents may be altered by colli-
sion with energetic particles. In returning to more stable oxidation
states these highly charged particles must traverse electron configu-
rations corresponding to unusual oxidation states. Since little is
known concerning homogeneous reaction rates in the fuel, it is possible
that especially the more dilute constituents could be present at
steady-state in an oxidation distribution that differs significantly
from equilibrium values. Such conditions could result in interferences
to in-line measurements by introducing unexpected spectral absorptions
and compromising potentiometric measurements.

Spectroelectrochemical methods will be used to investigate potential
interferences using techniques similar to those applied to the char-
acterization of unusual oxidation states. In this case, the species
will be generated in a deliberately hostile environment, for example,
unstable oxidized species would be generated in a reducing melt.
Spectral measurements in the immediate vicinity of the electrode
(using a carefully focused beam from a tunable laser) will be used

to provide estimates of reaction rates and predictions of possible
effects on analytical methods. More sophisticated electroanalytical
approaches (such as the ring-disc electrode system for the study of un-
stable species) will be coupled with spectral systems to provide addi-
tional measurements. Data obtained will be used to design experiments
and interpret results for Task 5.2.4, Effects of radiation on optical
components and spectra.
6-100

6.10.8 Task 5.7.4 Automation and application of analytical methods

 

The value of computers to in-line measurements has been demonstrated by
the application of a PDP-8I mini-computer to the measurement of y3tju
ratios in fuel salt in a thermal convection loop. Automated 24-hour
operation was achieved with about a 5-fold improvement in precision and

a more convenient presentation of data. It is evident that comparable
improvements can be achieved by automation and data processing operations
for analyses in all the methodology categories of the Program. Programming
activities will be started on the arrival of a replacement computer which
has increased capacity to control a variety of analytical equipment on
several installations. Also included in the activities of this task will
be the application of established in-line methods, either automated or
manually operated, in support of activities of the Program. This will es
include needed modifications for special installations, but will not in-

clude further basic development studies performed at the installation.

6.10.9 Task 5.7.5 Evaluation of analytical methods for an integrated
reactor surveillance system

 

 

The purpose of this activity is to develop an overview of reactor reguire-
ments and analytical capabilities to assure that all needed methods are
established in a form that is consistent with the needs for chemical sur- a
veillance of experimental and power reactors. Similar evaluations are,

of course, informally in progress and will continue during the course of

selection and development of methods; however, this task will incorporate i
the systematic practical assessment of methods after their capabilities
and limitations are established. With input from Chemical Research and
Development, Reactor Safety, Reactor Design and Analysis, Reactor Tech-
nology, and Maintenance, decisions will be made on the need for in-line
analysis of the various streams, the degree of redundancy for such
analyses, the hot-cell requirements for other methods, and back-up or
reference analyses. Also included will be practical considerations
such as the selection of locations for analytical devices that are
consistent with required response times and maintenance accessibility,
multiple containment of penetrations to meet safety requirements, cri- Go

teria for proof testing of the devices, the establishment of a quality -
control program, and the interfacing of the automatic control and out-
put of the devices with the computer system of the reactor. oo

The general approach will be to select, in consensus with other dis-
ciplines, those chemical variables for which reliable analyses are
essential to safe reactor operation and then recommend devices and
methods that will provide adequate measurement of these variables.

The installation of a multiplicity of devices for the measurement of

a critical variable may be recommended for test reactors. A reduction
in redundancy of measurements is expected for a demonstration plant
after the reliability of the devices has been established in nuclear
operations in a test reactor,

 

 
dg

 

aE

 

6-101

After the critical needs of the reactor are fulfilled, the value of other
in-line analytical determinations will be evaluated on a cost-benefit
basis. Computer models of reactor systems will be used to establish the
effects of off-design operations on performance parameters such as breeding
ratio and increased fuel inventory and to compare this cost with those

of installed analytical devices. It should be noted that many of the
proposed analytical devices can be modified to perform additional analyses
at nominal cost.

6.10.9.1 Subtask 5.7.5.1 Fuel system

Methods for the analysis of reactor fuel are the most completely developed;
therefore, evaluation for the primary system will be started whenever

the capabilities of an adequate fraction of the critical in-line methods
are demonstrated in application to the reference fuel. This activity

will then serve as a model for evaluation of methods for the other systems.
Critical determinations will include oxide, ust ust ratios or other redox
potential measurements, total uranium, and key corrosion products.

6.10.9.2 Subtask 5.7.5.2 Processing system

Since the processing system is still subject to extensive development
studies, general evaluation of methods in this area will have to be
delayed. Known critical determinations include protactinium in the salt
stream fed to the processing plant, and redox potential, protactinium,
uranium, bismuth, corrosion products and possibly oxide in the return
stream. Oxide in lithium chloride and some indicator extractants may
later be included as critical determinations for the rare-earth separ-
ation system,

6.10.9.3 Subtask 5.7.5.3 Coclant system

Evaluation will be started when methods are established for the coolant
that is finally selected for the reactor. Critical determinations will
include key corrosion products and determinations associated with the
distribution of tritium in the coolant system.

7. REACTOR SAFETY

7.1 INTRODUCTION

A significant effort in the development of MSR's will be devoted to a
comprehensive study of the safety of all aspects of such systems. In
general, the work in this area proceeds from the assumption that if such
reactors are constructed, they will be designed, built, and operated
normally so as to avoid any significant risks to the public health and
safety. In addition, it is assumed that the plants will be able to

deal safely with a variety of upset conditions which might reasonably
be expected to occur several times during the life of any given system.
However, it is also assumed that low-probability events, or combinations
of events, may occur with consequences that are more severe than those
associated with the more probable occurrences. These postulated events
and their consequences will be analyzed as completely as possible to
help define the margins of safety that are applicable to normal opera-
tion as well as to more clearly establish the safety characteristics

of molten-salt systems in highly abnormal circumstances.

7.1.1 Objectives

The primary objective of the work in reactor safety is to provide
analyses of postulated accidents in progressively greater detail as
the technology of molten-salt reactors evolves to ensure that the re-
quired degree of safety is achieved. It is anticipated that these
accident studies will contribute to the definition of component, sub-
system, and system safety requirements and, to some extent, to the
establishment of design and performance criteria that will make the
systems compatible with the overall safety objectives of the program.

Much of the technology that is developed within other areas of this
Program is safety-related and will, therefore, be applied toc the safety
analyses that are performed. However, some aspects of the overall
technology are uniquely identifiable with the question of reactor safety,
e.g., material or system properties and characteristics under conditions
that are encountered only during accidents. Thus, in situations where
the required safety technology cannot be developed by reasonable exten-
sions of established efforts within base-~technology areas, it will be
developed within the area of reactor safety. The objectives of such
safety technology development efforts are to provide all of the infor-
mation shown to be required for the comprehensive description of the
safety of molten-salt reactor systems.

7.1.2 Scope
Studies within the area of reactor safety are concerned principally with

the characteristics and behavior of materials, components, subsystems,
and systems in abnormal circumstances that would be expected to occur very

7-1
7-2

infrequently, if at all, during the anticipated lifetime of any given plant.
However, to the extent that the more normal operations of the plant define
system conditions that may be affected by accidents, some consideration Gu
must also be given to the normal behavior. Existing safety and safety-

related technology, developed either within the MSR program or within

other foreign or domestic reactor safety programs will be assessed,
adapted as required, and adopted for application to the safety effort
whenever such adoptions are consistent with the overall program objec-
tives. Additional safety technology will be developed within this area
only when unique, specific needs are identified.

7.1.2.1 Task Group 6.1 Guidance studies wi

The work in this task group is directed toward the qualitative, quantitative,
and ultimately probabalistic analysis of postulated safety-significant
accidents in MSR systems. Initially such studies will be applied to the
ORNL Reference Design MSBR. 1 However, as alternate designs are proposed

and developed, they will be similarly analyzed to clearly define their
safety characteristics.

Since the safety of MSR's has not been addressed completely to date, the

initial efforts will examine all postulated accidents to permit clear i
identification of the low-probability but potentially high-comsequence

events that will establish the safety characteristics of these systems

and help to define the needs for additional safety and safety-related -
technology. Detailed studies will be carried out primarily for those =
event sequences whose combined probability of occurrence and potential

consequences qualify them as high risk events. Some studies will also be

directed to the events with potentially very severe consequences to ed
determine the limits of MSR safety. Events whose potential consequences

do not reach safety significance will not be evaluated in detail.

These studies will rely extensively on analytical techniques, mathematical
models, computer programs, and data that are developed in other task groups
in this area as well as in other technology areas. However, special con-
solidated models and computer programs may be developed within this task
group if they are uniquely applicable to comprehensive MSR safety studies.

An important product of the guidance studies is the identification of tech- dE
nology and data needs for successful achievement of the area objectives.

It is anticipated that such safety and safety-related needs as are identi-

fied and justified in this task group will be fulfilled by activities in i
other task groups or technology areas. -

7.1.2.2 Task Group 6.2 Fission product behavior

The effort under this task group will develop data and models to describe

the behavior of fission products and tritium under conditions that are =
not encountered during either normal operation or reasonably anticipatable

transient situations. To the extent that other primary-system materials
[e2]

 

 

 

7-3

participate in the determination of fission-product behavior (e.g., forma-
tion of special chemical compounds or physical phases that contain fission
products}, this work will be coordinated with efforts in Task Group 6.3.
Data and models developed in other technology areas will be adopted when-
ever possible. However, specialized tests may be performed to verify the
applicability of base-technology data to accident conditions or to demon-
strate the validity of extrapolation from base to accident conditions.

7.1.2.3 Task Group 6.3 Primary system materials

 

The work in this task group will develop data and models to describe the
behavior, compatibility, and failure modes of primary system materials
(structural metals, graphite, and salts) under severe conditions that may
result from potentially high-consequence accidents. Only those mechanisms
and processes that are not treated in other technology areas and are not
amenable to extrapolation from base technology data, e.g., salt boiling
and the dynamic effects of the massive mixing of salts, will be examined.

7.1.2.4 Task Group 6.4 Components and systems technology

 

Data and models will be developed to define the responses and failure
modes of MSR components and systems under severe accident conditions
that are peculiar to this reactor type. In areas of commonality, compo-
nent and system safety technology that is developed in other reactor
programs will be adopted and applied to MSR system counterparts. How~
ever, the unique nature of many MSR components and systems, as well as
differences in conditions that may result from accidents, are expected
tc require some separate safety technology development.

7.1.2.5 Task Group 6.5 Safety imstrumentation and controls technology

 

This task group is concerned with the identification of needs for and the
development of specialized instruments and systems that are uniquely appli-
cable to postulated safety-significant situations in MSR systems. Tech-
niques and systems that are available or are developed to meet the needs
for normal operation and protection of the plant will be examined to de-
termine the degree to which they satisfy special safety needs. Equipment
and systems development will be undertaken only in those areas where safety
needs would not be met by other development activities.

7.1.2.6 Task Group 6.6 Maintenance technology

The technology for maintaining MSR's that is developed in other activity
areas will be examined in the light of conditions that may prevail during
and after high-risk accidents to determine if such accidents impose addi-
tional requirements on the maintenance technclogy. In general, the activity
in this task group will be limited to the identification of special condi-
tions, operations, and performance requirements that must be addressed.
7-4

7.1.2.7 Task Group 6.7 Safety technology of processing and by-product
storage and handling

 

Since the inventory of radioactive materials in an MSBR system is dis-
tributed throughout the complex, including the processing plant and short-
and intermediate-term by-product storage facilities, full consideration
will be given to the safety aspects of processing, storing, and handling
MSR fuel and by-product materials. These studies will identify needs for
and develop technology and methods required to protect against and miti-
gate the consequences of abnormal event sequences that could involve sig-
nificant risks. The work will address primarily any special aspects that
may arise from the facts that MSR materials and by-products may be dealt
with in different physical and chemical forms from those handled at other
nuclear facilities and that different mixes of potentially hazardous mate-
rials are involved (e.g., actinides and fission products are handled and
stored separately outside the reactor but both may be in association with
chemically toxic materials).

7.1.3 Relation to other technology areas

All other technology areas within the MSR program are strongly interre-
lated with the reactor safety area. However, as indicated above in the
discussion of the scope of the safety activities, this area draws heavily
upon the safety-related technology that is developed within other areas

as well as upon relevant safety and safety-related technology that is
developed within other reactor programs. Where practical, input and some
support will be provided from the safety studies to ensure that technology
is developed with sufficient capability, range, and accuracy to be directly
applicable to safety work. Independent development of safety technology
will be undertaken only if the required information is mot expected to be~-
come available from other sources. However, independent assessments of
technology developments from other areas will be performed to evaluate
their applicability to safety considerations.

7.2 PROGRAM BUDGET AND SCHEDULE
7.2.1 Schedule

Work in the area of reactor safety is expected to continue throughout
the MSR Program. As shown in Table 7.2.1, the initial activities are
associated with the analysis of postulated accidents in various con-
ceptual designs and the identification of needs for safety technology.
Subsequently, work is initiated to develop technology that is not likely
to become available through other reactor development activities. This
work could extend beyond the time periods shown if additional needs are
identified and justified. However, it is expected that most of the
technology will be developed in other activity areas in the program

and only minor efforts will be required to assess and adapt it for the
safety program.

7.2.2 Budget

The financial support required for the currently projected safety work

is shown in Table 7.2.2. The initial funding for accident analyses antic~-
ipates studies of several concepts. Later in FY 1979, there is a decrease
in this work as conceptual designs are being firmed up, and a subsequent
increase for the very detailed analyses in support of the design and con-
struction of particular systems. Only a small amount of support is shown
for developing safety technology. Additional support may be needed for
such work in the period beyond FY 1982 if technology needs not now iden-
tified must be satisfied. The projected funding is based on the assump-
tion that, as the construction of reactors is undertsken, there will be

a decreasing need for work in this area.

7.2.3 Xey program milestones

 

The reactor safety effort is closely tied to the work associated with the
development, design, and construction of reactors. Hence, the initial
round of safety analyses should be completed in FY 1978 to provide a
basis for the request for authorization of the MSTR and the MSTR mockup.
The development of needed safety technology should be largely completed
by FY 1983, so that it can be used in analyses to support licensing of
the MSTR. Most of the safety analysis of the MSTR should be completed

by 1985, when construction of that facility is projected to begin.

7.3 REQUIREMENTS, BACKGROUND, AND STATUS OF DEVELOPMENT

7.3.1 Safety requirements

The safety requirements, or safety performance criteria, that are appli-
cable to MSR systems are presumed to be equivalent to the intent of similar

requirements for nuclear facilities embodying other reactor concepts. Thus,

from the standpoint of safety, it is assumed that the numerical guidance
provided in 10 CFR 100 for doses from fission product releases applies to
an entire MSR complex, which includes the chemical processing system and
the on-site waste storage facilities.? (In the MSBR, all fuel reprocessing
is carried out at the reactor site, thereby eliminating routine releases of
radioactivity from other reprocessing facilities. While it is conceivable
that some cognizance may have to be taken of this fact in evaluating rou-
tine releases from normal operation, it is not clear that similar consider-
ations should be applied to safety analyses.)

Because of the fundamental differences between molten-salt reactors and
other reactor types, it is reasonably clear that different safety provi-
sions and engineered safety features will be required to help prevent

and, ultimately, mitigate the consequences of major accidents. For ex-
ample, it currently appears that emergency core cooling capability may

not be required but that a highly reliable, and possibly redundant, drain-
tank cooling system may be needed instead. Accurate descriptions of the
safety requirements of MSR's will be developed from the detailed safety
studies to be performed.

7.3.2 Background

In discussing the safety considerations of importance in MSR's it will be
convenient to treat three general areas — neutronic safety, which includes
primarily those characteristics of the plant that determine the possible
changes in the reactivity of the core and the resulting response of the
nuclear power and the temperatures and pressures in the primary system;
materials safety, in which the behavior and interactions of various mate-
rials in the system affect the safety consequences of important events;
and systems safety, which includes the safety behavior of major subsys-
tems, such as containment, as well as the system as a whole.

This section deals primarily with the ORNL reference design MSBR station,
including the processing plant and the interim waste storage facilities.
The purpose, however, is to delineate the important factors that must be
considered for any molten-salt reactor. The emphasis is on events with
potential safety significance but some discussion of less severe events
is included to provide perspective.

7.3.2.1 Neutronic safety considerations

 

The general principles of neutronic safety are the same for all reactors.
Small fluctuations in reactivity should produce only highly damped power
oscillations that do not lead to larger excursions. Large, rapid increases
in reactivity should be difficult to produce and be easily controlled before
the resulting power excursions produce damaging temperature or pressure
excursions. The characteristics of the MSBR plant are such that these
principles can be satisfactorily met.

The continuous removal of fission products and the adjustment of the fissile
inventory in the fuel salt during operation of the MSBR minimize the amount
of excess reactivity that must be compensated by control rods and hence
limit the potential for rapid increases in reactivity associated with this
excess. In the reference-design MSBR, the maximum amount of excess reac-
tivity that must be compensated by rods under normal conditions is expected
to be less than 1% Sk/k. Thus, the consequences of even the most severe
control-rod accidents are not likely to reach safety significance.

The fissile material in the on-line processing system amounts to less
than 1% of the reactor inventory. If all of this material could be re-
turned to the reactor, the excess reactivity would be increased only 0.47
or less. Furthermore, conceivable rates of reactivity introduction are
quite inconsequential ,® so accidents involving this material are well
below the range of safety concern.

*
The rate of reactivity increase would be only 5 x 1075% 8k/k per second

if the 3 liter/min salt stream from the processing plant to the 49,000~
liter reactor fuel system contained twice the normal uranium concentration.

Decay of precursors in the fuel circulating outside of the core reduces
the effective delayed-neutron fraction from 0.30% to 0.127 in an operating
MSBR. Thus one result of a cessation of flow is a 0.18% Sk/k reactivity
increase in a time on the order of the half-lives of delayed-neutron pre-
cursors. Somewhat larger reactivity effects of stopping and starting fuel
circulation could result from the perturbations of temperatures and the
effects of changing pressure on gas bubbles in the core.

The maximum effect of temperature changes is shown by the following argu-
ment to be quite manageable. The reactivity coefficient for changes in
temperature of the entire core (-0.9 x 10™° °C™1) is much smaller than the
coefficient for the fuel alone (-3.3 x 107° °C”! for a uniform change of
fuel temperature over the entire core). Thus the upper bound on reactivity
effects due to a temperature change in the core corresponds te cooling all
the core fuel (and none of the graphite) from the maximum operating temper-
ature (705°C) to the fuel liquidus temperature (500°C). This is only about
0.7% 8k/k. Effects actually attainable are smaller and, because they can
be produced only by inflow of cooler salt, occur with time constants of at
least several seconds. The safety rod system is quite capable of prevent-
ing power excursions due to such effects.

Because of the strong absorptions in thorium in the fuel salt, displacement
of a small fraction of the salt by voids has a positive effect on reactivity.
There are, in principle, two ways this could occur: (1) by increases in

the volume fraction of circulating, noncondensable gas, and (2) by boiling
of the fuel salt (vapor pressure equals 1 atm at v1400°C). Neither of

these processes appears to be capable of producing changes of sufficient
magnitude to represent a safety problem.

Under normal operating conditions the fuel salt in an MSBR contains 0.2
to 1.0 vol % of helium bubbles. This gas is introduced and removed con-
tinuously to strip 135%e., Thus, changes in the rate of addition or re-
moval or changes in system pressure will change the core void fraction.
At 1 vol Z, the voids in the reactor core represent about 0.039% in re-
activity. A complete depressurization of the fuel system, which would
allow these bubbles to expand by a factor of 2 to 3, would cause a reac-
tivity increase of only about 0.1% Sk/k. In addition to the bubbles, the
salt contains some dissolved helium and the pores of the graphite contain
substantially more. Although the total amount of helium in the graphite
is large, the rate at which it can diffuse out is' limited so that for
reasonably attainable rates of pressure loss in an MSBR (v-2 psi/sec)

the combined reactivity effect due to bubble expansion and graphite out-
gassing is only 0.005 (% &k/k)/sec or less.

Voiding of a few channels by local boiling (as might result if flow block-
ages occurred in individual fuel passages) is not a severe event. The
positive reactivity effect associated with 100 empty fuel cells” at the

*A fuel cell, as used here, means the 4 in. by 4 in. by 16 ft long region
associated with a single moderator piece.
7-10

average nuclear importance for the central core region is less than 0.5%
8k/k. Because the boiling temperature {at 1 atm) is more than 700°C above
the normal operating temperature of the salt, the energy input required to
heat the salt to the boiling temperature over a significant portion of the
core in a short time would require a nuclear excursion larger than any pro-
duced by credible reactivity inputs. Thus, boiling in the core will not
come into play as a positive reactivity feedback in any nuclear excursion
originating with the reactor at or near normal temperature.

Displacement of small amounts of fuel salt by graphite produces a positive
reactivity effect. At the center of the core (the most sensitive spot)

the effect amounts to 2.9 x 107%% §k/k per cm’. Conceivable events, in-
cluding sudden redistribution of clearances in response to flow changes

or accumulated stresses, produce no reactivity increase of much consequence.

A unique consideration in fluid-fuel reactors is the possibility of in-
homogeneity of the fissile material in the circulating fuel. Specifically
of concern is gradual segregation of fissile material outside the core,
followed by rapid introduction with the incoming stream. The MSER fuel
salt is quite stable over a range of compositions and conditions much
wider than the anticipated deviations. Segregation of uranium cculd
conceivably be produced by introduction of reducing agents or oxygen

inte the salt, so adequate protection against this must be provided in
the MSBR.

The response of the nuclear power to reactivity increases is governed by
the temperature coefficients of reactivity and the action of the control
rods and safety rods. Because the delayed neutron fraction is unusually
small, the MSBR power responds rapidly to reactivity increases.

The reactivity coefficients for uniform changes in fuel and graphite tem-
peratures are listed in Table 7.3.2.1. In response to reactivity transients,
core temperature changes will not be uniform, however. In particular,

the graphite will change temperature much more slowly than will the fuel
salt. (In the central core region, graphite comprises about 90% of the
heat capacity but only about 8% of the nuclear heat source is in the
graphite.) Consequently, heating of the fuel salt results in a prompt,
negative response of reactivity to a power excursion. This respense is
great enough to limit effectively the initial power surge caused by any
credibly rapid increase in reactivity. Thus safety rods are not required
to operate unusually fast. The total core temperature coefficient (fuel
plus graphite) is quite small; however, and might conceivably be positive.
{The calculated value is negative, but the current margin of uncertainty
is such that the coefficient could turn out to be positive.) As a result,
safety-rod action is required to prevent safety-significant variations in
temperature that might otherwise result from any reactivity change that
persists more than a few seconds.

In summary, the nuclear safety characteristics of the reference MSBER are
such that a reactivity excursion leading to a breach in the primary system
boundary appears to be highly unlikely.

7.3.2.2 Materials safety considerations

 

Although neutronically driven events appear to offer little likelihood of
causing serious damage to the primary system of an MSR, other events and

processes must be considered which might either cause such damage or in-

crease the vulnerability of the primary system to damage. Among these are

corrosion processes and possible interactions among the various materials a
of the primary, secondary, and steam systems.

Corrosion

Hastelloy N is corroded by MSBR fuel salt under normal conditions by
reactions of the type

2UF,, + M°® = 2UFy + MF, ,

where M° represents any metal that is thermodynamically capable of reduc-
ing the ut ion. The ratio UF3/UF, in the fuel salt is maintained at a
value such that equilibrium is reached with concentrations of Ni2¥, Fe 2%,
and Mo3" in the salt that are much less than 1 ppm and a chromium concen
tration less than one hundred ppm. The predominant corrosion reaction
then is reaction of UF, with chromium in the metal to form CrF, which
dissolves in the salt. Chromium becomes depleted near the surface and,
after the first few thousand hours, corrosion is limited by the rate of
diffusion of chromium to the surface. At MSBR temperatures this limit

is on the order of 0.1 mil/year of chromium depletion. is

Introduction of moisture and air into the fuel system produces HF and

metal oxides, which dissolve in the salt and make it more oxidizing and >
more corrosive to all constituents of Hastelloy N. During normal opera-
tion the contaminants can be kept low by controlling the composition of
the cover gas. Maintenance operations will almost inevitably introduce
some moisture, but with reasonable precautions to minimize air inleakage,
corrosion from this cause will have negligible effect on primary system
integrity. (Corrosion in the MSRE fuel system, which was opened two or
three times a year, averaged only 0.1 mil/year.}3 Thus, it does not appear Es
that normal corrosion processes will be involved in safety considerations.

A somewhat related process that might conceivably affect the safety of

MSR's is direct attack on the structural alloy by specific fission prod-

ucts — such as the intergranular attack by tellurium on Hastelloy N that

was observed in the MSRE. While this particular problem will presumably

be solved by efforts in other areas, studies will be needed to show that ee
no similar problems exist in the system that is finally evolved.

Salt-graphite interactions

 

The graphite in the core of a molten-salt reactor is essentially an inert
component under normal operating conditions. It is not subject to either
a

 

7-13

corrosive or erosive attack by the circulating salt. Since the salt does
not wet graphite surfaces, there is no permeation of salt into the graphite
pores and any tendency for such permeation would be further reduced if it
were necessary to seal the pores to reduce xenon poisoning. However, some
xenon (and other gases) will diffuse into the graphite and leave behind

the products of radiocactive decay. Additional fission products will be
deposited on the graphite surfaces. Except for their contribution to
afterheat (in the graphite) these fission products are not expected to
affect the graphite structure, even under accident conditions.

Interactions between the salt itself, or its major constituents, and
graphite have not been thoroughly examined for the conditions that might
develop in a serious accident. The boiling of salt at or near graphite
surfaces, as might occur under some core blockage conditions, has not
been studied with respect to effects of either the boiling itself or

the vapors that would be produced. Effects due to changes in salt chem~-
istry as a result of introduction of foreign materials during accidents
also have not been examined in detail.

Salt-to—-salt interactions

The eutectic of NaBF, _ NaF (92-8 mole %) was chosen as the secondary salt

in the reference MSBR because it has reasonably good coolant properties,
it is relatively inexpensive, and its melting point (725°F) is low com~—
pared to that of many other suitable fluoride mixtures. From the safety
standpoint it is important that mixing of fuel and coclant salt should
not give rise to situations that could endanger the health and safety of
the public or of the operators of the plant.

One event that could produce mixing of fuel and coolant salts is a leak
in a primary heat exchanger. The largest likely leak of this kind is
believed to result from the rupture of one tube in one of the heat ex-
changers. Depending on the location of the rupture, coolant salt would
enter the fuel salt in the primary system at an initial rate in the range
of 0 to 3.5 1b/sec and fuel salt would enter the coolant salt at a rate
in the range of 1.0 to 7.4 1lb/sec. That the leak existed would be sig-
naled by rapid loss in reactivity of the reactor or fission product
radicactivity in a secondary circuit or both. Upon either of these
signals the reactor would be shut down rapidly, the fuel salt would be
drained from the primary system into the fuel salt drain tank, and the
coolant salt in the affected secondary circuit would be drained into a
coolant salt drain tank.

The amount of mixing of fuel and coolant salts would vary widely, de-
pending on the design of the plant and the course of the event. We
estimate that as much as 450 ft3 of coolant salt could mix with 1700 fe3
of fuel salt in the primary system and 40 ft3 of fuel salt could mix
with 2100 ft3 of coolant salt in a secondary circuit of the reference
MSBR. No chemical reactions that would generate excessive heat or pre-
cipitate constituents of either salt would be expected to occur on
7-14

mixing, however additional work will be required to adequately substantiate
this expectation. Fuel salt and sodium fluoroborate are immiscible,
however, so two salt phases would be present in both systems. Although

the salts are immiscible, exchange occurs between the phases with lithium
and beryllium fluorides entering the lighter fluoroborate phase and

sodium fluoride and boron triflucride moving into the fuel salt phase.
Uranium and thorium fluorides remain in the heavy phase.

In the primary system the exchange of constituents between salts would

not be expected to have a significant effect on the melting point of the

fuel salt. The melting point of the coolant salt dispersed in the fuel

would increase somewhat, some BF; would be released, and the BF3 overpressure
in the primary system would be expected to rise to about 5 atm. In the
secondary system the interaction between the fuel and coolant salts would
tend to raise the liquidus temperature of the fuel-containing salt but

would not significantly affect the coolant salt. Since much of the secondary
system normally operates at a temperature below the liquidus of the

fuel salt, the fuel salt that leaked into the secondary system would
initially be dispersed as frozen particles throughout much of one cir-

cuit. Whether the particles remained as solids would depend on measures
taken to heat or cool the secondary circuit after the coolant salt had

been drained.

Another mechanism for mixing coolant salt into the fuel salt (but not
vice versa) is the failure of a secondary-salt line within the primary
containment. Since the primary containment of the reference design
funnels all salt spills to the fuel drain tank, such an event could
quickly add a major fraction of the coolant-salt inventory of the
affected loop to the fuel salt in the drain tank. If the four primary
loops continued to circulate salt at full speed, the drain-tank contents
would enter the primary system at about 650 gpm (170 1b/sec). However,
stopping the primary-pump motors and circulating the fuel salt with pony
motors would allow removal of shutdown heat without incurring the salt
mixing in the primary loop. In any event, it is likely that the two
salts would eventually become mixed in the fuel drain tank. The conse-
quences of mixing on this scale have not been examined in detail, but it
is not expected that they would represent a significantly greater safety
question than mixing via a failed heat-exchanger tube.

None of the conditions associated with mixing of fuel and coolant salts

in the primary or secondary systems appear to be capable of producing a
break in either gystem. The secondary circuits must be heavily shielded
against the radioactivity present in the coolant salt during normal opera-
tion. This shielding can be made adequate to protect against the fission
products that would be introduced by the fuel salt.

Salt-water interactions
Water and steam react with sodium fluoroborate to produce primarily hydro-

gen fluoride and sodium hydroxyfluorcborate. The reactions are not de-
structively exothermic, but the hydrogen fluoride is corrosive to the

 

 
 

 

 

7-15

metals of the reactor secondary system and the tubes that separate the
fuel salt from the coolant salt. Although the corrosion rates are not
catastrophic under any foreseeable circumstance, the leakage rate of
water from the steam system into the secondary system and the hydrogen
fluoride concentration in the secondary salt must be kept low in order
to maintain a low corrosion rate of piping and equipment.

In the event of a rupture of one or more tubes in a steam generator or
superheater, the rapid pressurization of the secondary system and the
possibility of transmitting that pressure to the primary system is the
major concern. Isclation valves must be provided to stop the flow of
feedwater and steam to the faulty steam generating equipment and pres-
sure relief devices must be provided on the secondary system to keep

the pressure below the system design pressure. The steam and salt that
are discharged through these devices must be contained but it has not

been determined if the reactor primary containment or some other secondary
system would be used.

Salt spills within the primary containment will not normally involve
water except for traces in the containment atmosphere. However, subse-
quent opening of the containment for maintenance may admit sufficient
moisture to allow some uptake by salt residues. In such cases it may
be necessary to examine the long-term safety consequences of possible
piping and containment corrosion by residual salt. Since the primary-
containment liner may be water-ccoled (much like the PCRV liner of an
HIGR) , assurance must be provided that the liner cooling water cannot
be mixed with spilled salt. Such a double accident, with sufficient
water, could lead to high containment pressures from steam generated
from the sensible heat of the salt.

7.3.2.3 System safety considerations

The preceding sections included discussions of some particular aspects of
safety technology and some specific postulated accidents, However, there
are additional safety considerations that are important throughout the
plant. Among these are the behavior of fission products in MSR systems
and the engineered safety features of the plant.

Radionuclide decay heating

From the standpoint of reactor safety, the chief importance of radio-
nuclide decay heat lies in whatever threat it may pose to the integrity
of the primary system.

In an MSBR, the fission products and transmutation products and the heat
produced by their decay are distributed through the reactor systems and
the processing facility in a manner that depends on the physical features
of the plant, the chemistry of the radionuclides, and the extent of re-
processing of the fuel salt. In the reference design MSBR, after several
7-16

months of operation at its design power of 2250 MW(t), the total decay
heat rate is about 152 MW, distributed as shown in Table 7.3.2.3.1. Most
of the heat is generated in the fuel salt by the decay of all classes of
radioactive products with half lives of a few minutes or less and of
longer lived products that are soluble in the salt.

Krypton and xenon diffuse into the pores of the core graphite or into the
helium bubbles that circulate in the fuel salt and are removed to the
drain tank. About 807 of the energy of decay of the gases that reach the
drain tank is released in the tank. The remainder is released in the
carbon beds. For the purposes of conservative design, each daughter atom
of a noble gas is assumed to deposit on the surface nearest the point of
decay of the parent atom and there to release its heat. This certainly
is the situation in the graphite and in the carbon beds. Depending on
the design, daughter atoms born in the off-gas lines or drain tank could
either be dissolved in fuel salt and returned to the primary system or

be carried on with the gas stream.

The fission products from element 41, niobium, through element 52, tellu-
rium, are not stable as metal ions under the normal redox conditions in
the fuel salt and are rapidly reduced to the elemental state.” These
metals are highly insoluble in the salt and are not wet by it, so they
tend to deposit on metal and graphite surfaces and collect at gas-liquid
interfaces. The distribution of the afterheat produced by these materials
depends on their distribution among the various surfaces. Table 7.3.2.3.1
shows two calculated distributions for the afterheat from metallic fission
products, reflecting uncertainties in their physical distribution. The
first is based on an assumed sticking coefficient — that is, the proba-
bility that a fission-product atom remains on the surface to which it
migrates — of 1.0 for metal and graphite surfaces and 0.1 for bubble sur-
faces. For the second distribution, the sticking coefficient for gas
bubbles was increased to 1.0 and no reentrainment was allowed in the salt
in the drain tank. The daughters of noble metals are also noble metals
which tend to remain where the parent was deposited except for iodine,

the daughter of tellurium. In the presence of flowing salt, iodine re-
turns to the liquid phase; otherwise it remains on or near the surface

at which it was formed.

The fuel processing system is the final location in which a substantial
amount of radiocactive decay heat is released. The source of heat there

is roughly equally divided between 23%Pa and fission products of inter-
mediate to long life. Decay heat generation is a most important factor

in the design of this system. The operation of the processing system
scarcely affects the decay heating in the reactor during operation, but
does reduce the heating rates at longer times after shutdown (and decay

of the shorter-lived fission products). From the foregoing, it is evident
that three conditions of operation must be considered with regard to

*
Because of this tendency to exist in the elemental state, these fission
products are frequently referred to as "noble metals" in MSR's.

release and removal of decay heat; normal operation at various power
levels, reactor shut down but fuel salt remaining in the primary system,
and reactor shut down with fuel discharged tc the drain tank. Only the
last two of these are regarded as having potential safety significance.
When the reactor is shut down, the radioactive decay heat decreases with

time as shown in Fig. 7.3.2.3. In a normal reactor shutdown, the fuel salt

is retained in the primary system for many hours, the primary pumps
continue to operate at full flow on the normal electric supply or at 10%
flow on pony motors driven by an emergency power supply. The secondary
pumps also continue to operate at flows in the range of 10 to 100%, de-
pending on the power supply. Heat is transferred from the primary salt
to the secondary salt; steam is produced at much reduced rates in the
steam generators and is discharged to the turbine condenser or to other
coolers. With 10% of their rated normal flow, two primary loops and
associated secondary loops will hold the temperature at or below the
normal level until 5 minutes after shutdown when one loop combination

is sufficient. In the absence of cooling, the temperature of the primary
system would rise to 1400 and 1500°F in 70 and 120 minutes, respectively.
The heat load in the drain tank begins to decrease immediately after such
a shutdown. Heat production in the off-gas system decays more slowly

and the heat production in the processing plant is little affected for
several hours.

Under accident or other unusual circumstances the fuel salt is discharged
to the drain tank for cooling. Discharge of salt from the primary system
into the drain tank could begin at shutdown and be completed in about

7 minutes. At this time the heat production rate in the drain tank would
be about 40 MW; the temperature of the salt would rise to a maximum of
1400°F in a few hours and then fall to about 1000°F in a few days, where
it would be maintained by control of the cooling.

Conditions in the off-gas system and in the reprocessing plant would not
be affected significantly by draining the reactor, but the conditions in
the reactor primary system would be markedly different. Draining of the
fuel salt would remove the fluid that transports the decay heat from the
graphite to the primary heat exchangers. If the secondary salt were
drained from the heat exchangers at the same time, the preferred means
for removing the heat from the decay of noble metal deposits on the heat
exchanger tubes would also be removed.

Calculations have shown that the components and piping in the primary
system could be designed to be cooled adequately by providing a system
that would maintain the cells walls at 1000°F. Heat would be transferred
by radiation and conduction within the components and would be radiated
to the cell walls. The temperature at the center of the graphite core
in the reactor vessel of the reference design was estimated to reach a
maximum of 1900°F after 14 hours, but the vessel walls would not exceed
1400°F. With some modifications of the current reference design, the
center tubes of the primary heat exchangers would not exceed 2000°F, and
the outer shell would not exceed 1400°F. Delaying the drain by 24 hours
and cooling the plant to 1050°F during that time would reduce the decay
heat rates by a factor of about 10 and would substantially reduce the
temperature rise.

Release of fission products

 

The potential release of fission products through multiple barriers and
their ultimate dispersion in the enviromment is a major safety considera-
tion in MSR's as in any other nuclear system. The processes governing the
behavior of fission products in the secondary containment, their leakage
to the outside, and their dispersion for MSR systems are not expected to
differ significantly from those in other systems. However, behavior in
and releases from the primary system and the primary containment may be
guite different. The chemical and physical form of the fission products,
their location within the system, and the conditions resulting from acci-
dents all may be expected to affect fission-product releases.

The fission products that are important from a radiological, or release,
standpoint are not necessarily those that are most significant in after-
heat considerations. For afterheat, all fission products with significant
decay energy are important, while for radiological safety, the emphasis
is on a more select group of biologically important radionuclides. For
purposes of orientation, Table 7.3.2.3.2 gives the calculated inventories
of some radiologically important nuclides (including actinides) in a MSBR
system and in PWR and LMFBR systems of comparable size. The MSBR in-
ventories are given just prior to shipment of high-level waste to a
federal repository while the PWR and IMFBR inventories are given just
prior to refueling. It is important to note the effect of continuous
processing on the in-reactor inventories for an MSBR, as these are the
inventories that would nominally be available for release during a
reactor accident. The inventories associated with the processing plant
and on-site storage facilities may not be ignored, but, because of their
isolation from the reactor, separate consideration must be given to the
different accidents that could lead tc their release.

Many radionuclides, including such radiclogically important species as Cs,
Sr, and I, exist in stable ionic forms in MSBR fuel salt and, therefore,
tend to remain in the salt even under upset conditions. However, it is
also necessary to know their behavior under highly abnormal conditions
where the salt may be subject to hydrolysis or te very high temperatures.

Another class of fission products, including the noble gases, is highly
volatile under MSR conditions and will tend to be found in the off-gas
system where release considerations again differ from those in the pri-
mary system. Daughters of the volatile nuclides, even though some of
them may tend to dissolve in salt, will generally appear in the off-gas
system, also. The amounts of Cs and Sr that lodge in the off-gas system
will depend on precursor half lives and the rates of precursor removal.

Yet another class of fission products, the noble metals, are found in
the elemental state throughout the reactor plant. Their importance from
the standpoint of activity release arises from the fact that some, like
tellurium, have important, volatile daughters (iodine, in this case).
Thus, the release characteristics of deposited fission products must
also be considered in safety studies.

Engineered safety features

 

Engineered safety features will be provided in all areas of MSR systems

to interrupt the progression of accident sequences and to help limit the
consequences of those events which may occur. An important safety feature,
the use of primary and secondary contaimment for the reactor system, has
been mentioned several times in this section. In addition, special con-
tainments will be provided for auxiliary systems such as the off-gas sys-
tem, the processing plant, and the waste storage facilities. Still other
safety features will be provided as their needs are established by contin-
uing safety studies.

The most unusual of the engineered safety features in the MSBR is the
provision for dealing with afterheat under accident conditions — the
heat source is led to the cooling instead of vice versa {as in the ECCS
for a light-water—~cooled reactor}. As described elsewhere, the bulk of
the fission products stay in the fuel salt, making shutdown cooling for
the fuel salt essential for prevention of excessive temperatures. The
ultimate cooling system is in the drain tank, so the reactor and con-
tainment are designed so that the fuel will get to that tank under any
credible accident conditions. The heat removal system is simple, rugged,
always operating (being used to remove heat from off-gas sources), and
can continue to operate without electric power and unattended to cool the
fuel as long as necessary.

In connection with the afterheat removal, it is worth noting that prob-
lems associated with it are much less intense in an MSBR because the
major source is inseparably associated with a very large mass of salt.
(The ratio of heat source at shutdown to heat capacity in the MSBR fuel
salt is only about one-tenth of the ratio in the dry core of an LWR.)
Because the heat source is sco dilute, the "China syndrome’ does not
appear to be a serious problem in an MSBR.

7.3.3 Status

Advances in the area of reactor technology, in general, and the work in
the ANP and MSR programs at ORNL have provided much of the information
needed to demonstrate the safety of MSR's. None of the work, to date,
has indicated any safety issues that cannot be resolved with existing
technology. However, MSR safety technology and the issues that are
specific to this reactor concept have not been subjected to the compre-
hensive analysis and assessment that have been applied to other reactor
concepts. Consequently, the safety assurance of MSR's is less firmly
founded and some additional technology development is required to demon-—
strate clearly the safety of these reactor systems. The following para-
graphs summarize briefly the current status of MSR safety technology.

 

 

 

 
 

7-23

7.3.3.1 Accident analysis

From the foregoing background discussion of MSR safety, it is apparent
that many postulated accident sequences have been examined for molten-salt
systems. In general, these studies have shown that none of the postulated
sequences is likely to lead to unacceptable consequences. However, the
entire spectrum of accidents has not been examined in sufficient detail

to ensure that no high-risk events have been neglected. Nor have the
postulated events been thoroughly sorted out from the standpoint of

risk. Consequently, further accident analyses are required to define
needs and provide guidance for additional safety technology development.
The methods and tools required for such analyses are, for the most part,
available within the general area of reactor technology. However, it will
be necessary to generate comprehensive system models of MSR systems that
will allow accurate evaluations of safety-significant events by adequately
describing all of the important plant processes, including those which

are peculiar to MSR's.

7.3.3.2 Fission product behavior

The general behavior of fission products in molten-salt systems has been
largely established by a variety of independent studies and by analyses of
the MSRE performance, both during and after its operation. As expected,
the noble-gas fission products (xenon and krypton) were readily removed
from the circulating fluid and transported to the off-gas system. Although
there was significant transport of these materials to the unsealed graphite
used in the MSRE, a factor of 6 reduction in xenon poisoning was achieved
with a simple gas-stripping system. Once removed, these gases could be
effectively and predictably handled in the off-gas treatment facility.
Post-shutdown release of gases previously held up on the graphite may,
however, be a radiological safety consideration in the primary system of

an MSBR.

In the MSRE, at least some of the noble-gas daughters formed in the off-
gas system were carried along by the gas stream, and large quantities
were accumulated in the particle traps upstream of the charcoal beds.
Since the off-gas had no further exposure to the fuel salt, no informa-
tion was obtained with respect to redissolution in the salt, which could
be important in the MSBR drain tank.

The fission products that, from thermodynamic considerations, were ex-
pected to remain dissolved in the fuel salt were shown in the MSRE to
behave as expected. Among the species of particular interest from a
radiological safety standpoint, both iodine and strontium showed no
tendency to escape from the salt. Some iodine did appear in the gas

in the reactor loop after salt drains, due to decay of precursors that
had been deposited on system surfaces. The safety consequences of such
releases from an MSBR, both during accidents and during maintenance,
must be examined. Many of the noble-metal fission products were found
on surfaces in the MSRE. If the apparent sticking coefficient of noble
metal atoms to metal surfaces is taken as 1.0, then data from the MSRE
7-24

indicate that the apparent sticking coefficient to graphite was 0.5-1.0

and to gas bubbles was <0.1. It is not clear whether the sticking co-

efficient to the bubbles was low because the metal particles did not

remain on the interfaces as the bubbles circulated in the primary system ws
or because the metal particles, after being released in the pump bowl

by the bubbles, were resuspended in the liquid and returned to the primary

system. This lack of conclusive data on noble-metal behavior led to the wi
range of distributions projected for the MSBR. Unless data are obtained

from other sources to permit better definition of the distribution, the

next molten~salt reactor will have to be designed tc deal with a substan-

tial range of noble-metal distributions. The principal safety considera-

tion with these materials and their daughters is ensuring that the heat

produced by thelr dazcay does not adversely affect the integrity of the

primary system components on which they are deposited. ws

The behavior of tritium in molten-salt systems is not yet well under-
stood. Although the control and handling of this material is not a a
safety consideration per se, the inventory and distribution of tritium
must be considered in evaluating the release of radionuclides during
accidents. In addition, any accident-related variations in tritium
behavior must be well known and protected against.

7.3.3.3 Primary system materials Bi

 

The area of materials technology for molten-salt reactors is not yet
fully developed, as indicated in other portions of this program plan.
Much of the safety and safety-related technology of structural materials,
graphite, and salts will be developed in conjunction with the efforts in
these other areas. From the information that is now available, it does
not appear that safety considerations will significantly affect the
choices of or the performance requirements on primary system materials.
While additional quantitative data on failure limits, failure modes,

and interactions under accident conditions will be needed for the de- é
tailed evaluation of accident sequences and consequences, the materials

that meet the requirements for normal operation and anticipated transients

will have suitable safety characteristics. a

7.3.3.4 Components and systems

 

Substantial effort has gene into the development of MSR components, but
much more remains to be done, particularly with respect to components

on which molten-salt service imposes special requirements (e.g., steam
generators and valves). However, as in the case of materials technology,
much of the safety and safety-related information will follow from the
basic development effort. Among the items of particular interest with
regard to safety are the containment and the provisions for afterheat
removal.

The ultimate reliance for protection of the public from an MSBR accident id
rests on the containment system that is in effect during operations.
El

wh

 

7-25

This system does not involve any untried construction techniques. The
inner walls of the reactor cell and the fuel salt drain tank cell must
be insulated and the cells must be heated and operated at temperatures
above 1000°F. The requirements for this system out to and including the
cell liner and liner cooling systems are very similar to those imposed
on the internal portions of the PCRV's used for HTGR's. However, because
of the lower design pressures involved in MSR containments, it is not
expected that prestressing of the concrete vessels (cells) will be re-
quired. As pointed out earlier, the characteristics of MSBR fluids
impose no severe problem with regard to pressurization or danger of
chemical reactions. Therefore, MSBR cells and buildings can be mostly
designed and built with the containment technology that has been thor-
oughly developed for other reactors.

In order to prevent potentially hazardous releases of radioactivity to
the environment during routine maintenance, as well as during accident
recovery operations, it will be necessary to provide special devices
and closed ventilation systems when the containment is opened. Some
experience was accumulated along these lines in the operation of the
MSRE, but on a much smaller scale than will be involved with the larger
MSBR system. This technology will have to be expanded to MSBR scale.

The technology associated with secondary containment is essentially the
same as for all other reactor containment systems.

The provision of shutdown cooling in an MSBR has as many facets as there
are repositories for the fission products. However, only the coeling of
the fuel salt in the drain tank appears to be a significant safety con-
sideration. Preliminary studies indicate that a natural convection
cooling system will provide the cooling required for safety.

7.3.3.5 Instrumentation and controls

 

No detailed studies have yet been performed to define the special needs
for safety instrumentation and controls in MSBR's. However, the postu-
lated accidents that have been examined do not appear to impose any re-
quirements beyond those needed for normal, safe operation.

7.3.3.6 Maintenance

The maintenance of molten-salt reactors, even under normal circumstances,
promises to be a challenging task. A number of techniques and procedures
were developed and demonstrated in the MSRE and some of these will, with
further development, be applicable to larger systems. However, additional
procedures, such as those for completely semi-remote cutting, cleaning,
and welding of large-diameter pipes must be developed for routine mainte-
nance, as well as for recovery from accidents. Preliminary studies have
indicated no major differences between the requirements for normal mainte-~
nance operations and those associated with major accidents. Similarly,
7-26

inspection techniques and procedures that are developed for normal, in-

service inspections are expected to be applicable to safety situations.

Special safety problems associated with maintenance will be addressed as
they are uncovered by the development program.

7.3.3.7 Fuel processing and waste handling and storage

No significant effort has yet been made to identify special safety problems
related to these operations in MSR systems. These areas will be addressed
as the system technology is developed.

7.4 TASK GROUP 6.1 GUIDANCE STUDIES

7.4.1 Objective

The primary objective of the work in this task group is the performance

of detailed analyses of high-risk accidents postulated for MSR systems

to: (1) quantitatively define the safety characteristics and safety
margins of such systems, and (2) identify any special needs for safety

and safety-related technology that must be developed to cause such systems
ta achieve levels of safety that would permit their application to the
generation of electricity on a large scale. A secondary objective is

the development of methods, consolidated systems models, and computer
programs required for the accurate analysis of significant safety events
and sequences.

7.4.2 Schedule and funding

The proposed schedule of effort for the studies to provide guidance for
the safety program is shown schematically in Table 7.4.2.1. For the
principal tasks, a continuing effort is maintained throughout the program
to ensure the availability of current results regarding accident pro-
gressions and consequences for safety assessments and the identification
of technology needs as they develop. However, the levels of effort,
particularly with regard to accident analysis, vary substantially. As
shown in Table 7.4.2.2, which shows the proposed funding for this task
group, studies to identify and describe accidents and accident sequences
rise to higher levels as designs for conceptual and proposed reactor
systems are evolved. The effort on transient analyses follows just behind
the descriptive analyses but with a similar pattern. Since these studies
are contingent on the development of reactor designs, their timing would
change with variations in the overall development schedule.

Risk analyses, being heavily dependent on the availability of performance
and reliability data for components and systems, cannot be pursued at any
substantial level until later in the program. However, some semiquantita-
tive information can be developed with very little input, so a small effort
will be undertaken early in the program to provide such guidance as can be
derived from these analyses.

The development of analytical methods for safety analyses depends first
on the identification of needs which have not been, and are not expected
to be, met by efforts within other technology areas. Although such needs
are expected to arise, particularly in describing the response of the
entire plant to major transients, work on this task will not begin for

a few years.

7.4.3 Facilities

The work in this task group is entirely analytical in nature, sc no ex-
perimental facilities are involved. The large-scale computing capability
implied by the transient analysis tasks is expected to be within the range
of existing digital, analog, and hybrid facilities currently available at
ORNL.

7.4.4 Task 6.1.1 Accident analysis

Several kinds of accident analysis, in increasing levels of detail and
accuracy, will be performed to provide a basis for assessing the safety
of MSR's. These analyses will be applied initially to the ORNL reference
design MSBR to establish, as quantitatively as possible, the safety
characteristics of a representative plant. As other conceptual designs
are developed, they will be subjected to similar studies to identify

any significant variations in safety characteristics or safety margins.
The analyses will be made progressively more detailed as the designs are
refined, and the most detailed studies will be made on systems actually
proposed for construction.

7.4.4.1 Subtask 6.1.1.1 Accident descriptions

The initial effort in the analysis of MSR will be a systematic, qualitative
description of possible accidents and event sequences. Although several
isolated transients have been examined in some detail and some accident
sequences have been proposed and studied, no organized effort has yet

been made to identify a major fraction of the possible accidents and the
interrelations between them. This effort is expected to result in the
identification of a full spectrum of events from minor upsets to acci-
dents with potential major safety significance.

The events will be classified and categorized to determine safety signif-
icance based on estimates of the likelihood for occurrence, severity of
consequences, and to some extent, availability of defenses against the
events. These classifications will be established with the aid of various
logical analysis tools, such as event-tree diagrams, which will also help
to clarify interactions among events and to identify available and/or
needed lines of defense. As additional design information and results of
transient analyses become available, the accident descriptions and event-
sequence diagrams will be refined to more clearly and quantitatively de-
scribe the nature and extent of the safety considerations associated with
each accident.
7-30

7.4.4.2 Subtask 6.1.1.2 Accident transient analyses

Representative accidents and event sequences identified in Subtask 6.1.1.1
will be subjected to quantitative transient analysis to determine the
magnitudes of the consequences of such accidents. The results of these
analyses will be used to identify those accidents whose safety significance
qualifies them for more detailed analyses. Later results, coupled with

the logical analyses, will provide the bases evaluating safety margins

as well as for defining additional technology needs and the needs for and
performance requirements of engineered safety features.

7.4.4.3 Subtask 6.1.1.3 Risk analysis

 

The final step in the definition of MSR safety is the performance of risk
analyses which entail the appropriate combination of accident occurrence
probabilities with accident consequences. Although some qualitative or,
at best, semiquantitative analyses of this kind must be carried out early
to help select the important accidents, definitive analyses require data
concerning component and system performance, reliability, and failure
characteristics that will not become available for some time. Thus,
studies of this kind, which serve primarily to reduce uncertainties in
safety margins, will continue even beyond the operation of prototypical
and demonstration reactor systems.

7.4.5 Task 6.1.2 Technology need identification

 

The accuracy of and, in some cases, even the performance of transient
and other accident analyses will be limited by the data that are avail-
able to describe material, component, sub-system, and system responses
under accident conditions. This task provides for the identification of
such needs and their publication so that the necessary information can
be developed. Additional technology needs can be expected to occur in
all the MSR technology areas, and most of them will be addressed under
this task. However, a separate, but complementary, need assessment

task is identified in the areas of safety instrumentation and controls
(Task Group 6.5) because of the highly specialized and diverse technical
requirements of such systems. Since the need assessment task spans the
entire range of MSR technology, the work will be shared among a number
of people with appropriate technical capabilities.

In general, it is expected that both safety and safety-related tech-
nology needs will be identified by this effort, and these categories
are addressed by separate subtasks below. It is assumed that needs
which are identified and appropriately justified will be fulfilled by
efforts in other parts of the overall program.

7-31

7.4.5.1 Subtask 6.1.2.1 Safety technology needs

This subtask is concerned with the needs for additional technology asso-
ciated specifically with the safety of MSR's. That is, it identifies and
justifies those needs which could not reasonably be fulfilled by activi-
ties in base technology areas. In addition, it will identify needs to
check or verify technology developed in other areas to ensure its appli-
cability to safety considerations. As such, it interacts most strongly
with other task groups in the area of reactor safety. However, close
correlation with base-program activities and need assessments is also
required to avoid non-productive duplication of effort.

7.4.5.2 Subtask 6.1.2.2 Safety-related technology needs

This subtask identifies those technology or data developments which,
although they are needed for safety studies, are also needed for the
design and safe operation of MSR's under more normal conditions. These
needs will in most cases have been recognized and be under development
as a result of other base-program investigations. However, this effort
will help ensure that no important safety-related needs are overlooked.

7.4.6 Task 6.1.3 Analytical methods

This task provides for the development of analytical methods, including
computational models, methods, and programs, which are needed for safety
analyses and which are not likely to become available from other sources.
Since safety analysis deals with transient events which are, by definition,
larger than those encountered in routine operation, the analytical tools
developed for design and routine analysis may not be adequate for safety
work. Among the areas where such inadequacies may occur are comprehensive
models to describe the behavior of an entire plant during severe or rapid
transients and models to describe large nuclear transients in circulating-
fuel reactors. (The "neutronic size” of the core may also be a factor.)
Wherever possible, existing models and methods will be adopted or adapted
for safety studies. Separate subtasks will be established to meet various
development needs.

7.5 TASK GROUP 6.2 FISSION PRODUCT BEHAVIOR

7.5.1 Objective

This task group is concerned with the development of the chemical and
physical technology required for accurate description of the behavior

of fission products in MSR systems under accident conditions. While
many safety and safety-related aspects of fission product behavior will
be elucidated by base program studies, the unusual conditions that may
arise in some accidents likely will require the initiation of special
efforts to obtain data. The work in this task group is directed primar-
ily toward the reactor primary system. Fission product behavior and
7-32

Possible releases associated with accidents in the waste storage facilities
and the more remote parts of the chemical processing system are treated
in Task Group 6.7.

7.5.2 Schedule and funding

Since the investigations of fission product behavior under this task

group are contingent upon the identification of safety-specific needs,

it is not anticipated that activities will be supported until a substan-
tial amount of safety analysis has been performed. Once the limiting
conditions of accidents have been established, it will be practical to
review the available technology and the ongoing base program effort to
determine what safety needs, if any, remain. Work will then be supported
to supply those needs. On this basis no activity is shown on the develop-
ment of fission-product safety technology for about three years (see

Table 7.5.2.1). Subsequently, the effort is expected to proceed at a
relatively low level as shown by the funding schedule (Table 7.5.2.2)
because essentially all, if not all, of the technology needs are expected
to be met by efforts in the base program. The technology development that
is supported by the safety program will be carried out by the same staff
who are involved in the base program effort.

7.5.3 Facilities

Any technology development that is performed under this task group is
currently expected to take the form of extensions in data ranges and in-
vestigations of phenomena which are chemically and/or physically similar
to studies in the base program. Consequently, it is not anticipated that
new or radically different facilities will be required beyond those used
in the basic studies. No additional facilities are, therefore, projected.

7.5.4 Task 6.2.1 Fission product release under accident conditions

The release of fission products from the primary system is an important
safety consideration in MSR accidents. The processes involved must also
be considered for normal operation and, particularly, when the primary
system is opened for maintenance. However, it is conceivable that condi-
tions during accidents may sufficiently alter these processes so as to
require additional study. Some of the mechanisms that may be investigated,
subject to establishment of need, are discussed in the following subtasks.

7.5.4.1 Subtask 6.2.1.1 Fission product release from salts

The release characteristics of fission products from fuel salts have been
studied extensively and the normal behavior is moderately well known.
Additionally, information will be developed within the base program for
normal and near-normal conditions. This subtask provides for investiga-
tions under special conditions that might result if, for example, the

primary system were breached and salt were spilled and dispersed in the
primary containment.

7.5.4.2 Subtask 6.2.1.2 TFission product release from metal surfaces

Fission product releases from MSR metal surfaces, both with and without
salt present, has received some attention but more studies are required
in the base program. This process is particularly important for mainte-
nance operations because deposited tellurium can be a source of free
iodine. From the standpoint of safety, releases from overheated sur-
faces or when the containment atmosphere is less well contrclled than
for normal maintenance may require special investigation.

7.5.4.3 Subtask 6.2.1.3 Fission product release from graphite

 

Fission products trapped in and on graphite may be subject to different
release processes when the graphite is strongly heated or exposed to
contaminants during accidents. If such processes are shown to have

the potential for altering the safety characteristics of MSR systems,
they will be investigated and evaluated.

7.5.4.4 Subtask 6.2.1.4 Fission product release from failed
charcoal beds

 

Although the charcoal absorber beds for retention of noble-gas fission
products are not an integral part of the reactor primary system, they are
sufficiently closely coupled to it that failure could lead to a release

of fission products into the primary containment. The high fission-
product inventory of these beds makes it desirable to examine their poten-—
tial effect on safety. Release processes that are peculiar to reactor
accident conditions would have to be defined before studies are initiated.

7.5.5 Task 6.2.2 Tritium release under accident conditions

 

Depending upon the nature of the tritium retention and control processes
that are developed for MSR's, either or both the primary and secondary
systems may contain substantial quantities of this radionuclide. It is
considered separately here because its behavior mechanisms differ signifi-
cantly from those of other fission-product radionuclides and because the
tritium handling technology for MSR's is a separate problem. Until the
tritium technology is developed further it will not be practical to iden~-
tify any specific investigations into safety problems in this task. How-
ever, such studies will be carried out when, and if, needs are identified.
7-36

7.5.6 Task 6.2.3 Fission-product behavior in primary and secondary
containments

The safety technology of fission-product behavior within containments

has been extensively studied in connection with other reactor types,

and applicable portions of that technology will be used in MSR safety
studies. However, the fundamental differences between MSR's and other
reactors could lead to different chemical and physical forms and mixtures
of fission products in the containment after an accident. Studies should
be performed to determine whether such differences occur and if they
significantly affect (either favorably or unfavorably} the in-containment
behavior of the radionuclides. If differences are found, their impact on
reactor safety should be evaluated.

7.6 TASK GROUP 6.3 PRIMARY-SYSTEM MATERIALS

7.6.1 Objective

The interactions, responses, and failure modes of primary-system materials
under accident conditions must be known if detailed safety analysis are

to be carried out. The objective of the work in this task group is the
quantitative establishment of any such safety-significant processes and
properties that are not established in base-program investigations.

7.6.2 Schedule and funding

 

The investigation of material properties and interaction processes re-
quires first that the parameter ranges that are peculiar to safety be
identified by extensive analysis of accidents and event sequences. Con-
sequently the schedule for this task group (Table 7.6.2.1) shows no
activity for three to four years. The schedule beyond that point is also
somewhat vague because of the strong pessibility that most of the required
safety technology will probably be developed by minor extensions of
established base technology tasks. The funding (Table 7.6.2.2) is
projected at a low level for the same reason.

7.6.3 Facilities
As is the case in the other safety-technology task groups, no special facil-

ity needs are projected because the same facilities used for the related
base program effort are presumed to be usable and available for this work.

7.6.4 Task 6.3.1 Materials compatibility under accident conditions

 

The effects and consequences of primary system material interactions will
be extensively investigated in establishing the technology required for
the design, construction, and normal operation of MSR systems. Abnormal

or unusual interactions that may be associated with accidents will be in-
vestigated in this task. Some of the areas in which such investigations

may be carried out, subject to need identification, are discussed in the

following four subtasks.

7.6.4.1 Subtask 6.3.1.1 Primary-to-secondary salt compatibility

This subtask will investigate primarily any unusual effects associated
with mixing of fuel and coolant salts in amounts and at rates which are
much greater than would ordinarily be anticipated. At the more severe
conditions (still to be defined} experienced in accidents, dynamic or
transient phenomena may have an effect on safety consequences and these
will be examined. The studies will be confined to salt mixtures whose
use in MSR's is rather firmly established.

7.6.4.2 Subtask 6.3.1.2 Salt-graphite compatibility

 

Possible unusual interactions between salts and graphite under accident
conditions will be examined to determine their safety consequences, if

any. Among the phenomena to be considered, subject to establishment of
need, are salt boiling near graphite and effects of vapors produced by
such boiling. Additional processes may be identified by accident analyses.

7.6.4.3 Subtask 6.3.1.3 Salt-metal compatibility

 

Interactions between salts, or salt vapors, and primary-system metals
under accident conditions, such as very high temperatures, will be in-
vestigated and evaluated for possible safety consequences. Only those
conditions will be considered that are not addressed in base-program
studies.

7.6.4.4 Subtask 6.3.1.4 Salt compatibility with drain tank coolant

 

No processes or mechanisms can be currently identified that would not

be evaluated for normal operation and anticipatable transient conditions.
If processes with potential safety significance are suggested by accident
analyses, they will be studied.

7.6.5 Task 6.3.2 Metal properties and failure modes

This task provides for investigations of metal properties in parameter
ranges that may be associated with accidents, but which would not other-
wise be required. Of particular interest are properties, behavior, and
failure modes of metals exposed to very high temperatures because of
their potential effects on the consequences of long-term loss of cooling
situations.
7-40

7.6.6 Task 6.3.3 Graphite properties and failure modes

 

Graphite characteristics and possible failure modes under extreme con-
ditions of thermal cycling or thermal shock should be examined for pos-
sible effects on reactor safety. Probably the most significant safety
consideration is that some degree of structural integrity be maintained
in the graphite moderator, but the integrity requirements have not been
determined. Since MSR graphite temperatures in severe accidents are at
least somewhat similar to those calculated for HTGR's, it may be possible
to make use of some aspects of graphite safety technology from HIGR
studies.

7.6.7 Task 6.3.4 Salt behavior at extreme conditions

 

Some consideration should be given to the safety aspects of salt behavior
at extreme temperatures or in the presence of contaminants that may be
introduced by accidents. Vapor and liquid compositions that result from
boiling, as well as possible sclid-phase separations, would be examined
if accident studies showed potential safety effect.

7.7 TASK GROUP 6.4 COMPONENT AND SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY

7.7.1 Objectives

This task group is devoted to the investigation of safety significant
processes, including failure, that may affect major components and sys-
tems in an MSR plant. The primary concern 1s with major safety systems,
such as containment, and highly abnormal processes, such as seismic
events, but other components, systems, and processes may be considered

if safety needs are identified. The objective of this work is to develop
those aspects of the relevant technologies that will help to define and
evaluate the safety consequences of accidents.

7.7.2 Schedule and funding

 

Development of component and system technology requires that the condi-
tions and performance requirements likely to be imposed on those systems
by postulated accidents be clearly defined by accident analyses. Such
analyses, in turn, require that reasonably detailed reactor-system con-
ceptual designs be available, Consequently, the major effort under this
task group, as shown in Table 7.7.2.1, begins after the development of
the needed design information. Some of the more readily apparent needs
can be identified from studies of current conceptual designs, so a small
amount of work can be started earlier. Table 7.7.2.2 shows the estimated
level of effort required for studies of currently recognized safety
questions. Since these studies are strongly dependent on the degree of
technology development under base programs, the amounts tend to be some-
what speculative.

7.7.3 Facilities

Major facilities will be required for development of the base technology
for MSR components and systems (see Section 10} and it is expected that
those facilities will be suitable and available for studies of safety
technology. One possible exception to this situation is in the area

of seismic studies. If the guidance studies reveal a need for a seismic
program that is specific to MSR's, and not satisfied by other seismic
study efforts, special seismic facilities might be required. Since no
special needs are currently recognized or anticipated, no facilities

are projected for the work im this task group.

7.7.4 Task 6.4.1 Containment systems

 

Because the materials to be contained as a consequence of MSR accidents
may differ from the materials of interest in other reactor systems, some
safety studies of MSR containments should be made. These studies would
be expected to delineate any unique requirements for or properties of
these contaimments. The following four subtasks describe possible areas
of investigation.

7.7.4.1 Subtask 6.4.1.1 Effects of salt spills-short term

Spills of primary and/or secondary salt into the primary containment
represent one class of possible consequences of MSR accidents. Since
the inside of the containment boundary may be covered by thermal insu-
lation and, presumably, an inner liner,” the possible effects of such
spills on the containment integrity and heat-removal capability should
be examined. Only short-term exposures need to be considered, however,
because all salt spills flow to the fuel drain tank.

7.7.4.2 GSubtask 6.4.1.2 Long-term effects of salt-spill residues

Major salt spills, if they occur, are almost certain to leave some salt
residues in the primary containment. The degree to which such residues
are removed is probably determined by requirements for opening the con-
tainment to perform maintenance. However, if residues are acceptable
from all other standpoints, is should be shown that they will have no
long term deleterious effect on the containment safety characteristics.
This subtask provides for the investigation of any such potentially
harmful effects.

*
This arrangement would be rather similar to that on the inside of a

PCRV for an HTIGR.
7-44

7.7.4.3 Subtask 6.4.1.3 Effects of other impurities

In addition to salt, the primary containment of an MSR could conceivably
be exposed to other impurities as a consequence of an accident. Among
the materials to be considered are air, drain-tank cooling fluid, and
water from the containment cooling system. The credibility of such in-
troductions must be considered, but the potential consequences of intro-
ducing the contaminants helps to determine the importance of excluding
specific materials. Thus, some study of the safety effects of other
contaminants is proposed.

7.7.5 Task 6.4.2 Seismic technology
Seismic events, at least up to the magnitude that may be used as a safe-

shutdown earthquake (SSE), should be examined in MSR safety studies,
partly to determine the responses of components and systems to such

events and partly to help define the safety requirements of plant designs

te survive the SSE without unacceptable consequences. Although methods
for analyzing and evaluating seismic events are reasonably well estab-
lished, additional work may be required tec permit analysis of the dif-
ferent components and systems associated with MSR's. This task provides

for any special development of seismic analysis capability that is needed.

7.7.5.1 Subtask 6.4.2.1 Failure of primary-system components

The ability of existing techniques to analyze response and describe
failure modes of MSR components under seismic stress will be examined

under this subtask. Any required capabilities that are peculiar to MSR's

would be developed and verified for use in accident analyses.

7.7.5.2 Subtask 6.4.2.2 Failure of engineered safety features

The same types of studies identified in Subtask 6.4.2.1 would also be
applied to the engineered safety features developed or specified for
molten-salt reactors. These efforts are assigned to a separate subtask
because of their importance to the overall safety of the plant.

7.7.6 Other safety technology tasks

Although no other needs for safety technology associated with components
and systems are currently identified, it is ~onsidered likely that such
needs will arise as the general techneclogy of MSR's evolves. Therefore,
it is anticipated that other tasks may, in the future, be added to this
group.

7.8 TASK GROUP 6.5 SAFETY INSTRUMENTATION AND CONTROLS

7.8.1 Objective

Preliminary studies of the needs for safety instrumentation and controls
for MSR's have revealed no major unusual requirements. Some consideration
must be given to the fact that the devices will be required to perform

at high ambient temperatures, but this is a normal operational as well

as a safety requirement. Nevertheless, it seems prudent to examine care-
fully the safety instrumentation and controls needs as reactor designs

are developed and general safety needs are defined to ensure that any
unique safety requirements are recognized and resolved.

7.8.2 Schedule and funding

The review of safety instrumentation and controls needs should be based
on a reasonably well established conceptual plant design. Therefore, no
effort is projected for the first several years of the program. However,
it is presumed that instrumentation and controls work in this task group
will be carried out during the period FY 1981 through FY 1985, and oper-
ating funds in the amount of $50,000 will be required in each of these
years. It is also possible that work would be required after this
period. Development to meet normal operational needs will proceed (see
Section 12) and if that work were to suggest a need for earlier safety
studies, they would be instituted as required. Since no special safety
needs are anticipated, the funding projected for this task group provides
only for surveillance of related activities and identification of possible
needs. If actual safety needs were identified, additional funding would
be required to support the associated development effort.

7.8.3 Facilities

No facility needs beyond those required for instrumentation and contrels
development within the base program are anticipated.

7.8.4 Task 6.5.1 Identification of instrumentation and controls
safety needs

This task provides for a review of safety instrumentation and control
requirements for MSR's under accident conditions and the identification
of any needs which have not been and are not likely to be met within the
base-program development effort. Also provided for is a review of the
existing technology for other reactor concepts to determine which needs,
if any, can be met by products of other development programs.
7-46

7.8.5 Technology development tasks

 

Tasks to develop instrumentation and controls safety technology will be
added to this program plan when, and if, needs for such development are
identified and justified. The nature of those tasks is dependent on the
results of Task 6.5.1.

7.9 TASK GROUP 6.6 MAINTENANCE TECHNOLOGY

7.9.1 Objectives

The primary effort to develop the maintenance technology for MSR's is de-
scribed in Section 11. Since the technology that is developed for normal
maintenance must be able to cope with high levels of radioactivity through-
out the reactor primary system, it is believed that some aspects of this
technology can be adopted or adapted to help mitigate accident consequences ws
and to recover from accidents. Among the situations in which maintenance
procedures could benefit reactor safety are those where the secondary con-
tainment remains accessible and work must be done to restore vital services,

Gi
such as afterheat removal capability. The objective of the work in this

task group is to identify ways in which maintenance technology could con-

tribute to reactor safety and to develop systems and procedures that are .
shown to be useful. he
7.9.2 Schedule and funding i

 

Application of MSR maintenance technology to safety situations will re-
quire substantially greater development of the methods and tools than is a
now available. In addition, detailed studies are required of situations
in which maintenance activities might be used to enhance safety. Conse-
quently, this work is considered to be a relatively long-range effort
which would proceed roughly in parallel with the design and construction
of reactor facilities. No work is projected before 1982, and subsequent
work is contingent on the success of the initial effort. The funding

for this work would begin at a low level and gradually increase to levels
indicated by then-established needs. It is currently planned that work
will be carried out during FY 1982 through FY 1985, and $50,000 in
operating funds will be required in each of these years. a

 

7.9.3 Facilities
Since it is presumed that the work in this task group would proceed along

lines generally consistent with normal maintenance technology, the facili-

ties established for development of that normal technology would be used. Eo
No special facilities are, therefore, projected for the safety effort.
 

7-47

7.9.4 Task 6.6.1 Development of maintenance technology to enhance safety

This task, and others in this task group which may subsequently be defined,
will develop special maintenance techniques, procedures, and equipment,
consistent with the normal maintenance technology, to help mitigate the
consequences of major postulated accidents and to assist in the recovery
from such accidents. Specific technology to be developed is contingent

on the definition and justification of safety needs.

7.10 TASK GROUP 6.7 SAFETY TECHNOLOGY OF PROCESSING AND WASTE STORAGE
AND HANDLING

7.10.1 Objective

Since an MSR plant incorporates its own fuel processing and intermediate-
term waste storage facilities, the safety technology associated with
these facilities must be addressed as part of the overall safety effort.
(Safety significant events in these ancillary facilities probably will
not directly affect reactor safety, and vice versa, but some safety-
related interdependence may be involved.) The purpose of the work in
this task group is to develop any needed safety technology to minimize
the possibility of major accidents in these facilities and to help miti-
gate the consequences of accidents which might occur.

7.10.2 Schedule and funding

Postulated accidents involving the fuel processing and waste facilities
will be examined as part of the safety guidance effort, Task Group 6.1.
Results of that effort, along with the onset of design and construction
of facilities for a reactor will determine the schedule for this work.
However, no significant effort is anticipated prior to 1982. It is
planned that work will be carried out during ¥Y 1982 and FY 1983, and
$50,000 in operating funds will be required during each of these years.
The schedule and funding beyond this period depends on the nature of

the safety needs that are identified. The initial funding for this work
is at 3 low level to permit planning of the safety development work re-
quired to meet the needs. Additional funding would be provided as needed
to carry out specific developments.

7.10.3 Facilities

No facility needs can currently be projected for this work.

8. REACTOR DESIGN AND ANALYSIS

8.1 INTRODUCTION

8.1.1 Objective

The objectives of this activity are: (1) to develep the conceptual
design for a commercial 1000-MW(e) MSBR in sufficient detail to identify
the major areas in which additional technology development is required
and to produce meaningful estimates of the nuclear and economic perfor-
mances of this reactor type, (2) to develop the design criteria and
conceptual design for a molten-salt demonstration reactor that will pro-
vide the information necessary for construction of commercial MSBR's

in sufficient detail to identify additional technology development which
is required for comstruction of the demonstration reactor and to provide
improved estimates of the capital and operating costs for the demonstra-
tion reactor, (3) te develop the design criteria and conceptual design
for a molten-salt test reactor in sufficient detail to identify additional
technology development which is required for construction of the test
reactor and to provide improved estimates of the capital and operating
costs for the test reactor, and (4) to develop the design criteria and
conceptual design for a molten-salt test reactor mockup in sufficient
detail to identify additional technology development which is required
for construction of the test reactor mockup and to provide improved
estimates of the capital and operating costs for the mockup.

An additional important objective of this activity is the examination

of alternate reactor types such as molten-salt converter reactors using
uranium or plutonium fuel makeup as well as uses for molten-salt reactors
other than large central station electric power generation in sufficient
detail to assess the likely economic importance of alternate molten-salt
reactor types. Limited conceptual design werk would be carried out on
alternate reactor types which show promise.

8.1.2 Scope

The scope of this activity consists of the general areas of (1) design
studies for MSR power plants, (2) systematic accumulation of design
information, (3) identification and development of codes and standards,
(4) examination of factors important in licensing MSR's, and (5) devel-
opment of computational methods for nuclear analysis of MSR systems and
their application.

8.1.2.1 Task Group 7.1 Design studies of MSR power plants

 

The scope of this task group includes completing conceptual designs for
a commercial 1000-MW(e} MSBR as well as for a demonstration reactor, a

test reactor, and a test reactor mockup in sufficient detail to identify
and guide the required technology development and to provide meaningful

8-1
8-2

cost and schedule projections. The intent of the design work is for
program guidance only, and no systems will be designed in sufficient
detail for component fabrication. Limited studies and conceptual de-
sign will be carried out for MSR types other than high performance
breeders in order to assess their likely economic impact.

8.1.2.2 Task Group 7.2 Design technology

The scope of this task group includes the areas of establishing design
bases and methods for equipment for 1300°F operation; the compilation

of design properties for fuel and coolant salts, graphite, Hastelloy

N, and other reactor materials; the preparation of design reports on
selected MSR systems; the compilation of cost data and analysis of plant
costs for MSR systems; and the operation of a comprehensive molten-salt
reactor information system.

8.1.2.3 Task Group 7.3 Codes and standards

The scope of this task group includes the identification and development
of the necessary codes and standards for design and construction of MSR
plants and component development facilities. Existing codes and stand-
ards such as ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section 3, Class 1, as
well as RDT standards and quality assurance procedures, will be carefully
examined with respect to MSR systems, and additional codes and standards
will be developed as necessary to ensure that satisfactory design, con-
struction, installation, and testing procedures are available.

Code cases required for use of materials in nuclear service, such as
the use of modified Hastelloy N in the MSBR primary circuit, will be
developed and submitted as necessary.

8.1.2.4 Task Group 7.4 Licensing of MSR's

The scope of this task group includes those activities required to iden-
tify any characteristic of molten-salt reactors which could adversely
affect obtaining a license for operation and to develop acceptable
alternatives to mitigate serious delay. In particular, it is intended
that sufficient attention be given to this area that questions affecting
licensing can be identified early and suitable alternatives developed
before significant investments are made in technology development and
conceptual design.

8.1.2.5 Task Group 7.5 Nuclear analysis of MSR power plants

The scope of this task group includes the nuclear analysis of control
systems and methods, and the development of additional computer methods
as required for analyzing the nuclear performance of MSR systems under
both steady-state and anticipated transient conditions.

8.2 PROGRAM BUDGET AND SCHEDULE
8.2.1 Schedule

The design studies will concern several different reactors and there will
be over lapping in time, as certain work on different concepts will be
carried on simultaneously. The studies having to do with the 1000-MW(e)
MSBR, as an example, will be a continuing study. The reference design
reported in ORNL-4541 will be used as a point of departure for these
studies. Nuclear calculations and cost analyses will be updated as the
supporting technology development progresses. Figure 8.2.1 shows diagram-
matically how the major reactor design efforts are interrelated and the
involvement of industrial participants in the work. Also shown, to add
perspective, is part of the reactor technology development effort (dis-
cussed in detail in Section 10) leading to the construction and operation
of a Components Test Facility (CTF) which will provide important input to
the reactor design work.

The studies on conceptual designs of commercial plants will guide devel-
opment work and will indicate areas in which further work is required.
Initial work on the 1000-MW(e) plant will deal primarily with safety.
During FY 1975, safety studies (see Section 7) will occupy most of the
design analysis work. Beginning in FY 1976, performance and economic
analyses will be started at a low level. Beginning in FY 1977, some
conceptual design work will be started on the 1000-MW(e) breeder. This
effort will be directed toward several features of the reference design
that are known to require additional study.

The schedule chart, Table 8.2.1, shows three large projects leading to
the commercial breeder: a molten-salt test reactor (MSTR), an MSTR
mockup, and a demonstration reactor. These will be started in a stag-
gered way as shown. After a serious review has been made of the MSBR
studies that have taken place in the past, a start will be made on
determining the preliminary design of the demonstration plant.

Factors related to the 1000-MW(e) MSBR which require further study in-
clude heat exchanger design, core design, moderator graphite removal,
and the drain tank cooling system. It is anticipated that by the be-
ginning of FY 1977, any remaining questions regarding the choice of a
secondary coolant will have been resolved. This is a rather urgent
question that must be answered as soon as possible as it influences
much of the design of the plant. All aspects of safety including
licensability will be studied thoroughly beginning during FY 1975.

Preliminary conceptual design of the demonstration plant will begin in
early FY 1978. Basic questions such as the number of primary loops,

type of heat exchanger, and maintenance philosophy (removal of heat ex-
changers versus tube plugging) will be considered. The number of pri-
mary loops will tend to determine the size of the components to be tested
in the reactor mockup. Conceptual design of the demo plant will continue
throughout the period covered by this activity as desirable changes in
design become apparent from the technology development studies.

A test reactor, intended to prove the features of the demonstration
reactor, will be operated prior to completion of the demonstration

plant design. Conceptual design of the test reactor will begin in

FY 1978. This timing allows two years of conceptual design to have
been completed on the larger plants in order to establish the basic
elements of the test reactor.

Alsc by FY 1978, enough of the design technology will have been completed
that high temperature design bases will have been determined so that the
conceptual design will be on reasonably firm ground. After two years,

by the end of FY 1979, the preliminary safety and hazard analyses will
have been completed so that authorization for the test reactor can be
requested. The period FY 1981 through FY 1984, will be required to
complete enough of the detailed design of the test reactor plant so that
construction can begin in early FY 1985.

When design of the test reactor plant has been largely completed, work
can be concentrated on the design of the chemical processing plant which
is scheduled for completion by mid FY 1986. The entire test reactor
plant should be completed by the beginning of FY 1989, and operation of
the system can begin.

The fourth major design effort will be concerned with a reactor mockup.
In crder to have the input from the other conceptual design studies,
design of the mockup will not begin until the start of FY 1979. All
major decisions about design temperatures, salt compositions and com-
ponent configurations will have been reached by this time. Also, code
cases will be in preparation so that the necessary technology to do the
design will be in hand. Authorization for the reactor mockup is to be
requested for the beginning of FY 1981 with completion of a major portion
of the detailed design by FY 1982.

Construction of the reactor mockup will begin in FY 1982 and will be
completed two years later. The design of the chemical processing system
will not be completed until about mid FY 1984, with construction of the
system to follow, aiming at a total reactor mockup completion date of

the end of FY 1985. The plant will then be operated as long as useful
information can be obtained from it. It is likely that, toward the end
of operation, some rather drastic off-design-point experiments will be
run. These tests might involve thermal shock, or similar kinds of exper-
iments which would yield valuable information.

The activities shown in Table 8.2.1 include substantial participation by
industry during the first few years, via work subcontracted by ORNL

and possibly by work supported by industry. (It is anticipated that
subsequent industrial activity would be associated primarily with the
large capital projects.) The primary purposes of this participation
are to further develop industrial interest and to allow the program to
benefit from industrial views and concerns while conceptual designs are
evolving. It is expected that the final conceptual designs of both the

 

 
Py

ee=]

8-7

MSTR and the demonstration reactor would be developed as a joint ORNL-
industry effort. In addition, industrial reviews and evaluations will
be extremely valuable in guiding the overall technology development
effort.

Mainly for comparison purposes, there are some other studies which will
parallel the continuing 1000-MW(e) studies. These will involve chiefly
nuclear and economic analyses of converter reactors and plutonium-fueled
MSR's. Some conceptual designs will likely be made to see where capital
costs can be reduced by the more simple plants. These studies will be
worked in as they are needed.

8.2.2 Budget

A summary of the funding projected for this activity area is shown in
Table 8.2.2, with separation of the ORNL and ORNL-subcontracted industrial
components. The industrial effort covers (1) early participation by
industry in helping to define the conceptual design of the 1000-Mw(e)
MSBR, and a test and demonstration reactor and (2) industrial assistance
on the design and construction of large component test and development
facilities. The low level of support for the ORNL effort during the
first two years reflects the fact that no conceptual design work is pro-
jected; only performance and safety assessment of the reference design

is planned. The ORNL design effort would increase with the onset of
conceptual design work in FY 1977 and reach a peak during FY 1979 as the
conceptual designs of the MSTR and the MSTR mockup are completed. The
required funding would then decline somewhat; however, significant support
would be required for more detailed conceptual design studies of the
demonstration plant, and especially for continuing work on MSR licensing
and the development of codes and standards.

8.2.3 Key program milestones

 

The completion of certain parts of the design and analysis effort of
MSR's will represent milestones of the program. The first of these,
expected to come in about two years (FY 1977), is a firming up of the
design technology to the point where materials and design bases for
their use at high temperatures can be considered to be established.
This should permit the second milestone, a commitment in early FY 1981
to build a test reactor.

A reactor mockup 1s to be built and operated prior to the construction
and operation of the MSTR, and the authorization of the mockup is co-
incident with authorization of the test reactor. Other significant
milestones that relate to design and analysis are the completion of
the MSTR mockup in FY 1984, and the start of MSTR construction in FY
1985.

8.3 BACKGROUND AND STATUS

A comprehensive summary of the background and status of the molten-salt

= reactor was issued in August 1972;! and since the program was interrupted
soon after the report was issued, the information contained in it is
still reasonably current.

Over the past twenty years, several molten-salt reactor plants have been
examined conceptually, and two experimental molten-salt reactors were
ps built and operated at ORNL. The Aircraft Reactor Experiment was operated
briefly in 1954 (ref. 2) and demonstrated the basic concept. However,
since the mission of that project was not central-station power genera-
tion, the reactor lacked many features that are important for large-
wa scale breeders. In the middle 1960's another molten-salt reactor, the
MSRE, was operated for an extended period of time and yielded much valu-
able data upon which power reactor concepts could be based. This system
sa used a fuel salt generally similar to that proposed for the breeder, an
unclad-graphite moderator, a secondary coolant salt circuit, and a struc-
tural alloy of interest to the breeder concept.
Two basic breeder concepts have been studied and reports have been issued
on the conceptual design studies.3*"% The first of these involved two
radioactive primary coolants, a fissile stream of uranium, lithium, and
id beryllium fluorides and a completely separate blanket or fertile salt
of thorium, lithium, and beryllium fluorides. This system appeared to
offer excellent breeding performance and a relatively simple fuel proc-
a essing plant, but maintaining the separation of the two fluids via
graphite tubes in the core would have been difficult in view of the
dimensional changes which occur in graphite during neutron irradiation.
Developments in the area of chemical processing and recognition of alter-
nate neutronic design possibilities led to the adoption of a single-fluid
concept in which both the fissile and fertile materials are dissolved in
one primary salt.

For the past several years, the MSR conceptual design effort has been
directed toward the single-fluid breeder system which features a single,
a large reactor vessel and four primary coolant pumps that circulate fuel
salt between intermediate heat exchangers and the core. The reactor
vessel contains unclad graphite to provide neutron moderation and three
"zones:'" core, blanket, and reflector. Fuel salt circulates through
all three zones which are not physically isolated from each other: the
different neutronic effects in the zones are achieved by carefully
selecting the fuel-to-moderator ratio for each zone. Each primary loop
contains equipment for gas (helium) injection and removal to provide
for stripping of !35Xe and other volatile species. Some fuel salt is
continually circulated between the drain tank and the primary loops to
a cool portions of major components and the off-gas stream. The drain
tank provides the initial holdup for decay of fission-product gases as
well as afterheat removal capability if the fuel salt must be drained
from the primary loop.

 
8-190

Beyond the primary system, there are no major differences between the
cne~fluid and the older, two-fluid concepts. A secondary salt, currently
sodium fluoroborate, transports the fission energy from each intermediate
heat exchanger to a steam generator which is coupled to a more-or-less
conventional supercritical steam system for generation of electricity.

All parts of the primary system are contained in metal-lined, hermetically
sealed cells which provide primary containment and radiation shielding.
Secondary containment is provided by the usual domed cylindrical structure
which encloses the reactor plant.

8.3.1 Primary systems layout and structural design

Although the basic reactor concept is reasonably well established, there
are many aspects that have not yet been studied in sufficient detail to
resolve all potential questions. These include the layout and design of
all major parts of the primary system.

Since the primary coolant in an MSBR contains the fissile material, both
the breeding performance (doubling time} and the economic performance

are influenced by the out-of-reactor inventory of fuel salt (i.e., that
in the drain tank, pumps, piping, heat exchangers, and processing plant).
Thus, there is considerable incentive to make the primary system as com-
pact as possible, consistent with the design requirements of adequate
heat transport, long life, maintainability, and safety and reliability
during both steady-state and transient conditions. While all of these
requirements were considered in the evolution of the conceptual design
and layout (from which inventory, performance, and cost data were devel-
oped), the required detailed reviews and analyses have not been performed
to fully prove the designs.* In particular, more stress analysis work

is required to show that ordinary mechanical, as well as thermal, stresses
throughout the system are compatible with design and life requirements
for all conditions.

The physical arrangement of the graphite inside the reactor vessel of

an MSBR is important in determining the performance of the system. In
the "core" and "blanket" zones, the fuel (or graphite} volume fraction
affects breeding performance, as well as the basic neutronic character,
of the plant and must, therefore, be carefully established and maintained
during all phases of operation. The reflector must be cooled by flowing
fuel salt, but the fuel volume fraction must remain low in the outer
regions to prevent high fission rates in these regions which would lead
to increased neutron losses {lower breeding gain) and greater irradiation
damage to the reactor vessel. Since graphite dimensional changes are an

*Substantial review and analysis work along these, and other, lines was
carried out by the Molten-Salt Group under the direction of Ebasco
Services, Inc., through a subcontract with ORNL. The results are re-
corded in internal correspondence.

8-11

effect of neutron irradiation, the core must be designed to accomodate
such changes without unacceptably degrading the reactor performance.
The power densities and attendant fast-neutron fluxes in the high-power
regions will limit the useful life cof present-technology graphite to
about four full-power years. Therefore, the graphite arrangement must
also allow for periodic replacement of at least some of the moderator.
Additional work is required to resolve remaining design questions re-
lated to the graphite configuration and the removal and replacement of
graphite in the core region.

Additional work is required to ensure that radiation heating is appro-
priately handled in the reference design. During operation, sufficient
salt or other coolant flow must be available to remove direct radiation
heat from all components; heat rejection from components must also be
adequate to prevent overheating due to the decay of deposited fission
products when no salt is present (as after a drain); the drain tank
cooling system must safely accommodate all normal and credible abnormal
heat removal situations. All of these considerations have been factored
into the design, but not with sufficient refinement.

All of the primary-system components within the primary containment must
be physically supported in such a way as to accommodate thermal expansion
effects and major disturbances, such as earthquakes, without loss of in-
tegrity. Although the internal construction of the cells is similar in
principle to the interior of the PCRV for an HTGR, the primary system
pressure boundary in an MSBR is independently contained by this structure
rather than being a near-integral part of it. Consequently, additional
design effort must be applied to equipment-support concepts.

8.3.2 Design methods

Commercial-scale MSBR's will be designed mechanically for a useful life
of 30 years at temperatures as high as 1300°F with numerous thermal
cycles. However, the design pressures are relatively low. These con-
ditions are generally similar to those for HTGR's and LMFBR's, and
considerable effort is being expended in those programs to develop de-
sign methods that will ensure that components and systems function
safely and reliably under such conditions. Much of the technology that
is being developed will be applicable, or at least adaptable, to MSBR
design problems. However, the primary MSBR structural material (Hastelloy
N) has different physical and aging characteristics than the materials
to be used in either HTGR's or LMFBR's. Therefore, considerable effort
will be required to adapt, demonstrate the applicability of, and apply
appropriate design methods to MSBR systems.

Since the fuel composition in an MSBR is uniform throughout the core,

the static neutronic design of such a core is relatively straight-forward
and can be adequately handled by any of a number of existing static design
methods. Available methods are expected to be adequate even for detailed
static design calculations. However, the circulation of the fuel adds

a level of complexity to the kinetic analysis of MSBR's. A good basis
8-12

exists for the kinetic analysis of circulating-fuel reactors, as evi-
denced by the successful design of the MSRE. Some additional methods
development will be needed for the accurate analysis of larger reactors
such as the reference MSBR, particularly for the larger and more rapid
transients that must be considered for off-normal and accident condi-
tions. In addition, methods will have to be developed to describe the
transient behavior of an integrated MSBR plant from the core through =
the steam system.

8.3.3 Capital costs

Capital cost studies on molten-salt reactor plants have been made in
recent years by several independent organizations. ORNL estimated the
costs for the 1000-MW(e) reference design. Independently, Black and
Veatch, the Reactor Assessment Panel of the Edison Electric Institute,
and the Molten-Salt Group of Ebasco estimated the capital costs of MSBR Ee
systems. The conclusions from all these studies were that MSBR's appear
to be economically attractive in the U.S. power economy. However, each
of these studies was necessarily limited in precision by the state of
development of the conceptual design that was subjected to analysis.

Such limitations will continue to exist until MSBR's reach commercial
application, but the levels of uncertainties can be expected to diminish
as the reactor design evolves. Therefore, the capital costs, and all
other aspects of MSR economics, should be frequently reassessed to ensure
that design and development efforts are being applied to systems that

are, in fact, attractive. EE

An important aspect of the capital (and operating) cost assessment of
MSR's is determining the impact which various design options have on
cost. The reference MSBR uses a particular design configuration, a
particular secondary coclant, and a particular steam cycle. However,
various alternatives have been, and will continue to be, advanced from
time to time. Among the possible alternatives that have been suggested
are converter and simple burner reactors, smaller or multi-use reactors,
alternate secondary coolants, systems with two (different) intermediate
coolant circuits in series, and alternate steam cycles. The economic ti
effects of such alternatives, singly and in various combinations, should
be examined to provide a sound basis for choosing the most desirable
system(s) to be developed.

8.4 TASK GROUP 7.1 DESIGN STUDIES QF MSR POWER PLANTS

8.4.1 OCbjective

The ultimate objective of design studies of MSR's is to be able to design i
a dependable, safe, molten-salt breeder reactor that will produce excess

fissile material from fertile thorium at a sufficient rate to contribute

significantly to the U.S. electric power demands. The reactor must have "
a capital cost that is competitive with other types of electrical gener-
ating plants of comparable size and the operating costs must also be
 

8-13

competitive with such plants. In attaining this objective, it is
obviously necessary to develop the technology, including viable com-
ponents to be used in such a plant. The contributing chemical, mate-
rials, processing, technology, and related programs are discussed in
other sections of this program plan.

8.4.2 Schedule

The design studies will be concerned with a number of separate reactors.
(See also Fig. 8.2.1 for a diagram showing the interrelation of these
activities). The initial advanced conceptual studies, in conjunction
with accomplishments in other technology areas, would be expected to
provide a basis for and approval of continuation of component technology
development on a larger scale. After receipt of such approval, the
preliminary conceptual design for the demonstration reactor would be
carried out and the major features of the molten-salt test reactor
(MSTR) would be defined. The next step would be the conceptual design
of the MSTR mockup as a lead-in to its detailed design and construction.
This facility, which would not be operated as a critical reactor, would
permit partial and, in some cases, complete testing of full-scale MSTR
components in a reactor-like environment. Simultanecus with operation
of the MSTR mockup, other aspects of operation and testing of develop-
mental equipment would be carried out in the Components Test Facility
(see Section 10). After operation of the MSTR, a demonstration reactor
plant would be constructed and operated. The schedule for this task
group, Table 8.4.2, indicates work done at ORNL and also work anticipated
to be done by industrial organizations.

8.4.3 Funding

The operating fund requirements for design studies are shown in Table 8.4.3.
The initial design effort would begin at a low level in FY 1974 and in-
crease slowly until efforts associated with major facilities are under-
taken. However, since the construction design efforts for those facilities
are included in other areas (see Sections 13, 14, 15) the funding for

work in this activity does not reach a high level. As work on the major
facilities becomes the primary effort, the required support for this
activity declines, but some support must be maintained to provide surveil-
lance, monitoring, and technical guidance of other activities.

8.4.4 Task 7.1.1 ORNL studies of 1000-MW(e) MSBR

 

The evolution of molten-salt reactors is expected to proceed from an
MSTR mockup, to the MSTR, to a demonstration reactor, and finally to
commercial plants. However, the incentive for following this path
derives from the attractiveness of the final objective system — the
1000-MW(e) breeder reactor. In addition, the intermediate reactor
systems will all be designed and operated to further the development

of the breeder technology. Consequently, it is important to have as
complete and detailed a conceptual design as possible for the breeder
to permit accurate assessment of its value to the U.S. power economy
and to help establish the design and performance requirements of the
developmental plants. The work in this task is directed toward the
production of an advanced conceptual design for a 1000-MW(e) MSBR

and a demonstration reactor.

8.4.4.1 Subtask 7.1.1.1 Overall conceptual design

 

A reference conceptual design was produced by ORNL," but that design
was based on particular requirements (e.g., for core moderator design
and equipment function, support, and layout) that are not necessarily
optimum. Specific portions of the design which should be reexamined,
and possibly revised, are discussed in other subtasks of this general
task. The initial work in Subtask 7.1.1.1 will be directed toward a
review of the reference system with emphasis on the process design.
Interelations between the steam cycle, the secondary coolant, and the
primary salt will be studied further, and a comprehensive study of
tritium management will be undertaken. Subsequently, as system design
modifications are developed, they will be integrated intc a compatible
overall conceptual design that will be susceptible to detailed perfor-
mance and economic assessment.

8.4.4.2 Subtask 7.1.1.2 Core design

The design criteria for an MSBR are determined by the neutronic perfor-
mance requirements, with appropriate considerations of operational
effects and maintenance needs. In the current reference concept, these
requirements were implemented by a graphite-moderator arrangement for
which it was assumed that the moderator in the core and blanket zones
would be removed every four years, as a unit, and replaced with a new
assembly. The reflector was designed for an initial fuel-volume frac-
tion of 1%, but without detailed consideration of long-term changes

due to irradiation effects. The moderator design will be reexamined in
this subtask and modified, as required, to satisfy the following needs:

a. graphite pieces that can be easily fabricated, coated if necessary,
and adequately inspected before use in the reactor,

b. graphite pieces, sub-assemblies, or assemblies that can be re-
placed with maximum safety (and with reasonable effort and cost)
when the design life is reached,

c¢c. a graphite reflector that limits neutron leakage to acceptable
levels and adequately protects the reactor vessel from fast-
neutron damage during its life,

d. appropriate distribution and orificing of salt flows throughout
the core, and

 
 

 

 

§-17

e. provision for regulating and shutdown control rods as required
for operation and safety.

In addition, the design of the reactor vessel will be reviewed to ensure
that requirements of fabricability and inspectability are met. The core
design studies will be supported by neutronic design calculations (in
Task 7.5.1) to ensure that the desired nuclear performance is met and
by additional technology development work if needs are identified. A
reduced-scale or a few-channel model of the core may be needed prior

to the operation of the MSTR mockup to help demonstrate the adequacy

of designs or to examine transient behavior. Such a model, if needed,
would be incorporated in the Components Test Facility (see Section
10.12).

8.4.4.3 Subtask 7.1.1.3 Primary system layout

The layout of the primary system in the current reference design repre-
sents a compromise between minimum fuel volume and a 30-year design life
in the face of normal and abnormal stresses and stress cycling — with
additional constraints of simplicity, inspectability, and maintainability.
In this subtask, the reference arrangement will be reviewed to determine,
first, if these design criteria have in fact been met. In particular,
steady-state and transient stress analyses will be performed to verify
the estimate of design life.

Alternate layouts will also be examined to determine whether simpler
and/or more economical arrangements can be devised. It has been sug-
gested, for example, that pipe and vessel liners in high-stress regions
might reduce thermal stresses and permit a more compact arrangement.

The attendant saving in fuel inventory would, in this case, have to be
weighed against the added system complexity to judge the value of such
a concept. Such tradeoffs will be evaluated for this and other layouts.

8.4.4.4 Subtask 7.1.1.4 System structure and support

The structural design of the major components and the methods for sup-
porting them inside the insulated and heated containment cells require
additional analysis for the reference design MSBR. The proposed arrange-
ment of suspension from above appears to offer simplicity but may have
disadvantages in terms of maintenance and seismic restraint. The
reference and alternate designs will be studied in this subtask to en-
sure that a viable concept is adopted.

8.4.4.5 Subtask 7.1.1.5 Rejection of radiation heat
In this subtask the major components of the reference design will be

examined to determine whether heat generated by nuclear radiation is
satisfactorily rejected, and the conceptual designs will be modified
8-18

where necessary to ensure such heat rejection. Both normal and off-

normal conditions will be considered. In normal operation, the primci-

pal consideration is surfaces that are not naturally cocled by flowing ws
salt — positive cooling must be assured. Under off-normal conditions,
particularly when the primary circuit is drained, less heat may have to
be rejected but its rejection is likely to be more difficult. (The

heat sources in the drained system arise from decay of deposited fission
products.) The primary heat exchanger is one example of a component
where some changes in conceptual design may be required in order to
limit temperatures in the drained system. The drain-tauk heat rejection i
system will also be carefully studied in this subtask. This system must
operate effectively under all conditions and should remain operable under
even the most severe accidents. A variety of alternative systems and
coolants will be studied and the most promising combination selected for
the reference design.

8.4.4.6 Subtask 7.1.1.6 Design alternatives

Although nominal choices have been established for all important features a
of the breeder concept, there are several areas in which alternative

possibilities exist that cannot yet be eliminated from consideration.

Among the more prominent areas of choice are the secondary coolant i
(nominally sodium fluoroborate) and the steam power cycle (nominally
supercritical with 700°F feedwater). When alternatives are considered,
as in Task 4.2.6 for alternate coclants (see Section 5), it will be
necessary to examine their effects on the conceptual design of the
system and components to provide a basis for factoring such effects
into assessments of the alternatives. In this subtask, preliminary
conceptual designs of components and subsystems will be generated to =
accommodate alternative choices of major system features. These designs
will then be used in assessing the performance and economics of modified
breeder concepts.

 

8.4.4.7 Subtask 7.1.1.7 Demonstration reactor

 

When the breeder concept is sufficiently well defined, it will be possible

to prepare a preliminary conceptual design for a demonstration reactor

which will ultimately provide the experience necessary for design of E22
commercial reactors. However, since other conceptual design work will
be in progress (Task 7.1.2), the demonstration breeder will represent

a concensus judgment of the most desirable system. Most features of
the demonstration system will be like those of the concensus commercial
system but this is not a universal requirement. It may be desirable,
for example, to design the demonstration plant for lower total power

or for a shorter operating life. However, it is anticipated that much ws
of the earlier conceptual design work will be directly applicable to

the demonstration reactor. The "final" conceptual design will be used

as a basis for selecting design criteria for a test reactor, as well Gi
as to more clearly estimate the cost and schedule for the demo plant.
 

8-19

8.4.5 Task 7.1.2 Industrial studies of 1000-MW(e) MSBR

In addition to the basic, conceptual reactor study, it is desirable to
obtain as much industrial input and participation in the program as
possible. Industrial organizations will be encouraged to participate
in the program, and will be at least partially supported through ORNL
subcontracts.

8.4.5.1 Subtask 7.1.2.1 System design description and cost analysis

A separate conceptual design for a 1000-MW(e) MSBR should be developed
by industry, probably through an ORNL subcontract. The design should
be sufficiently complete to identify unambiguously all major features
of the reactor system, and should be arrived at independently, but not
necessarily by ignoring previous work. Considerable progress toward
such a design was made previously by an industrial group” under sub-
contract to ORNL; however, the design was not fully developed. This
work, and the results of ORNL studies, could serve as a starting point
for further design effort. After the design is sufficiently well
established, it should be fully described in a preliminary System
Design Description (SDD) and evaluated in terms of performance and
economics. This design and its analysis should be available before

a detailed design effort is undertaken for subsequent development of
MSR's.

8.4.5.2 Subtask 7.1.2.2 Recommended research and development program

Although the conceptual designs should rely primarily on available tech-
nology, some credit should be taken for technical developments which are
expected to occur over the next two to five years (e.g., demonstrations
of Hastelloy N suitability and chemical processing methods). Despite
the taking of such credit, the detailed studies required to produce an
SDD can be expected to reveal inadequacies in the existing technology,
as it is applicable to MSR's. These inadequacies should be reduced to
a recommended program of research and development which would be pre-~
pared and documented in this subtask.

8.4.5.3 Subtask 7.1.2.3 Safety analysis

An independent analysis of the safety of MSBR's would be made by indus-
trial participants under this subtask. The analysis would be based,
initially, on available conceptual designs and would subsequently be
extended to examine possible differences associated with design varia-
tions. This study should begin with an appraisal of the basic safety
considerations for MSBR's and extend through transient analysis of
several postulated accidents which could have safety significance for
such systems. The results of the study would be documented.
8-20

8.4.6 Task 7.1.3 ORNL study of MSTR

 

As a result of the various studies of MSBR's, it should be possible to
describe a "most probable” breeder reactor — that is, ome that could be
designed, built, and safely operated with acceptable breeding and eco-
nomic performance. Those studies will alse identify specific aspects
of the technology that should be proved in a demonstration reactor and
developed to the demonstration stage in an MSTR. The purpose of this
subtask is to evolve a conceptual design of an MSTR that incorporates
all the features whose development and testing are required for the
demonstration plant.

The test reactor would probably be designed to operate at a moderate
power level (possibly a few hundred thermal megawatts) to generate
"breeder quality’ steam but not necessarily electricity. The system
would likely be equipped with extra instrumentation and testing facil-
ities, along with equipment for imposing transient conditions that would
not usually be encountered in normal operation. Breeding, as such,
would not have to be a design objective since it is believed that veri-
fication of a predicted conversion ratio would demonstrate the adequacy
of the neutronic design methods. Important design objectives would be
operation at breeder power densities, neutron fluxes, and temperature
differences; components would have to be large enough to test design
techniques, manufacturing capability, and performance characteristics.

The ORNL conceptual design, in conjunction with other independent con-

ceptual designs, would be used as a basis for specifying and guiding
the detailed design of an MSTR.

8.4.7 Task 7.1.4 Industrial study of MSTR

 

In this task, an independent industrial study of the MSTR would follow
close behind the ORNL study te allow for criticism of the initial effort
and the careful consideration of possible alternatives. Although the
basic design objectives for this study would be similar to those for

the ORNL work, the industrial view of testing needs may differ and the
separate implementation of the objectives would provide additional
options for the detailed design. This study could be, but would not
have to be, performed by the same organization that carried out the
breeder conceptual study.

8.4.8 Task 7.1.5 Studies of alternate designs and uses of MSR's

From the standpoints of resource utilization and overall economy, the
most likely long term application for MSR's is the single-fluid breeder.
However, other designs and uses should be examined to determine whether
shorter~term applications exist for simpler, smaller, or special pur-
pose systems. Among the alternate systems to be examined conceptually
in this task are low-power-density converters, simple plutonium burners,
and modest-size process heat systems.

 

 

i
8-21

The breeder reactor requires periodic replacement of high-quality
moderator graphite and continuous operation of an integrated, on-line
chemical processing plant. The difficult task cof graphite replacement
could be avoided if the core were sufficiently large and the power
density sufficiently low to permit a 30~year graphite life; and the
on-line processing plant could, in principle, be replaced by periodic
batch reprocessing of the fuel on a cycle of a few years. The conver-
sion ratio for such a system would be only about 0.9 to 0.95 (the low
power density prevents the breeding ratio from decreasing as much as

it would if only on-line processing were eliminated), although the cap-
ital costs could be significantly lower than for the breeder. This sys-
tem would be examined to determine whether the associated power costs
would be sufficiently attractive to justify further study.

A slightly simpler system could result if a reactor were designed to
simply "burn" plutonium that is produced in LWR's. It appears that
such burning could be accomplished more cheaply in MSR's than in other
systems, but such systems should be examined more carefully.

The high temperatures attainable in MSR's may offer the possibility

for process heat generation, and small systems may offer some advan-
tages for multipurpose heat and power applications. Again, studies

should be made to evaluate the desirability of developing MSR's for

these purposes.

8.5 TASK GROUP 7.2 DESIGN TECHNOLOGY

8.5.1 Objectives

The objectives of the work in this task group are the development of
design and performance criteria for components, subsystems, and systems
to be built into MSR's and the development of methods for analyzing and
designing such items. Current design data and related information will
be maintained and documented as required.

8.5.2 Schedule

Some work is currently being done in this task group and considerably
more will be required as the design characteristics of MSR's evolve
from the work in Task Group 7.1. This work is expected to continue
throughout the time span of the MSR program. The breakdown of the
effort among the various tasks and subtasks is shown in Table 8.5.2.

8.5.3 Funding

Although the work in this task group extends over a long time period,
the level of effort, as shown in Table 8.5.3, is relatively modest; a
number of the tasks require only part-time effort. The principal
effort is associated with the development and formalization of design
criteria and methods.

8.5.4 Task 7.2.1 Establish design bases and methods for equipment
for 1300°F operation

 

This task involves principally, two activities. The first is the develop-
ment of design and performance criteria for equipment which will operate
at the higher temperatures and the second is the development of design
methods for meeting the criteria.

8.5.4.1 Subtask 7.2.1.1 Design criteria

 

The conceptual designs of MSR systems will establish the service condi-
tions and many of the performance requirements for the reactor equipment,
including such items as chemical environment, temperature, pressure, and
material flow rates. Under this subtask, the relevant requirements for
each component or system will be assembled and compiled into a set of
design criteria. This work will be done in close cooperation with the
design and development efforts to ensure that realistic criteria are
established which meet the design needs and are capable of implementation.

8.5.4.2 Subtask 7.2.1.2 Design methods

 

Much of the equipment in an MSR will be expected to operate for up to

30 vears at conditions which are near the limits of applicability of
current design methods. Work is currently being done in other USAEC
programs {notably the ILMFBR and HTGR programs) to develop methods for
(1) designing equipment for long-term high-temperature service, and

(2) analyzing designs to demonstrate their adequacy. To the maximum
extent possible, these methods will be adopted and applied to MSR pro-
gram needs. Additional work will be done to extend the range of capa-
bility if it is required and to demonstrate applicability of the methods
to materials and components of interest to MSR's.

8.5.5 Task 7.2.2 Compile design properties

 

A complete, accurate, and current set of design-related properties of
all materials of interest in MSR systems must be maintained. These will
be used extensively in developing conceptual designs for components and
systems and in defining needs for equipment and technology development.
Conversely, the design and development efforts will help to establish
needs for specific properties and the accuracy requirements. This task
provides for the compilation of the relevant data and its distribution
to users within the program.

8.5.5.1 Subtask 7.2.2.1 Fuel salt

 

Properties of the nominal fuel salt are fairly well established, and
all physical and chemical properties will be tabulated and made avail-
able to the prospective users.

8.5.5.2 Subtask 7.2.2.2 Coolant salt

There is uncertainty concerning the optimum cooclant-salt composition,
and for some time the properties of several alternate secondary coolants
will be considered. Properties of the coolant that is finally chosen
will be collected as they become available.

8.5.5.3 Subtask 7.2.2.3 Graphite

 

The quality of the graphite used in an MSR has a direct bearing on the
reactor plant design. Isotropic graphite with good radiation-damage
resistance will allow the power density in the reactor to be higher
and therefore will, by lowering the specific fuel inventory, improve
the nuclear performance of the plant. Alsc, low permeability (coated)
graphite will improve the neutron economy by lowering neutron losses
to xenon. The characteristics of potential graphites for MSR's will
be tabulated and made available. Needs for additional data will be
determined.

8.5.5.4 Subtask 7.2.2.4 Hastelloy N

 

The structural alloy for the MSR primary salt circuit is expected to
be a modified Hastelloy N whose development is discussed in Section 2.
When the reference alloy has been adequately tested and proven, its
properties (strength, creep characteristics, thermal properties, radi-
ation resistance, etc.) will be collected in a form suitable for the
relevant design work, including the design of developmental items.

8.5.5.5 Subtask 7.2.2.5 Other reactor materials

 

Physical and chemical property data must also be compiled for a variety

of other materials of interest in MSR's. Structural materials other

than Hastelloy N may be selected for portions of the primary and secondary
systems; reactor control materials will be needed; special materials may
be specified for valve seating and bearing surfaces; and many other mate-
rials will be needed.

8.5.6 Task 7.2.3 Design reports on selected MSR systems

 

In a molten-salt breeder plant, as in any reactor plant, there are
many supporting systems that must be specified and designed. As these
systems become identified and conceptual designs are completed, the
systems will be described in autonomous design reports which emphasize
the performance requirements and criteria. Systems in this category
include the auxiliary power system, the after-heat removal system, and
the fission-product handling system. In many cases, reports on these
systems will constitute a basis for further discussion in draft SDD's.

8.5.7 Task 7.2.4 Compilation of cost data and analysis of plant costs

The anticipated capital and operating costs of commercial MSBR's are ex-
pected to be important factors in guiding development activities within
the MSR program. Moreover, since MSBR costs are likely to be compared
with costs of other energy systems, it is essential that cost estimates
be as realistic as possible and that they accurately reflect the avail-
able technology. Thus, capital and operating cost estimates will be
made as early as the conceptual designs are sufficiently advanced, and
the estimates will be updated and refined as necessary to incerporate
additional information that has been developed. Established procedures
will be used for estimating costs so that the results will be suitable
for comparisons with estimates for other systems. In addition to the
cost estimates for reference concepts, data will be generated to permit
economic evaluations of tradeoffs associated with various design alter-
natives (e.g., higher-cost secondary coolant vs. simpler or less expensive
equipment in the secondary system).

8.5.8 Task 7.2.5 Molten-salt reactor information system

A computerized data set containing abstracts of a large number (currently
373) of MSR-related documents is on file at ORNL. This data set, desig-
nated MSRIS for Molten-Salt Reactor Information System, was established
to provide program participants with a readily accessible, computer-
searchable summary of most of the technical information that is directly
relevant to MSR's. Although no complete documents are stored in the
system, information is provided about the sources and availability of
documents. This system, which can be made accessible (via telephone)

to qualified participants outside ORNL, will be updated on a continuing
basis to ensure maximum utility of the information.

8.6 TASK GROUP 7.3 CODES AND STANDARDS

8.6.1 Objectives

Codes and standards for the design, construction, operation, and mainte-
nance of nuclear power reactors have been and continue to be under develop-
ment throughout the nuclear industry. Many of these are generally applicable
to all nuclear systems, including MSR's, but many others are applicable only
to specific reactor types. Regardless of their range of applicability, the
ultimate purpose of such standards is the same — to ensure adequate safety
and reliability in the systems to which they are applied. The objective

of the work in this task group is the establishment of such standards and
codes, specifically applicable to MSR's, as may be required or desirable

to ensure for MSR's the same levels of safety and relisbility that are
required in other reactor systems.

§-27

8.6.2 Schedule

The initial work of establishing needs for standards and preparing pre-
liminary criteria could begin immediately, but, as shown in Table 8.6.2,
no direct effort is anticipated before FY 1977. This work would con-
tinue for the duration of the program with the major emphasis occurring
when material code cases are prepared and when standards are set prior
to the design and construction of specific nuclear facilities or major
developmental facilities.

8.6.3 Funding

As indicated in Table 8.6.3, the funding for this work will remain at a
low level until FY 1979, when a code case will be prepared for modified
Hastelloy N. As work related to modified Hastelloy N is completed, that
support will decline, but additional support will be required to develop
preliminary standards for the MSTR and for the demonstration reactor,
and for upgrading and refining the resulting standards.

8.6.4 Task 7.3.1 Standards for MSTR

 

The entire primary system of the MSTR will be designed and built in com-
pliance with all applicable parts of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel
Code, Section 3, for Class I components. Other applicable sections of
the ASME Code will be used, as appropriate, for other portions of the
system. These code requirements will be supplemented by applicable AEC-
RRD standards, AEC Regulatory Guides, and ANS standards.

The MSR is currently unique among U.S. power reactors in the use of a
circulating liquid fuel and an on-line fuel processing facility. For
these and other reasons, many standards may have to be modified, or
generated for MSR's; for example:

1. Since radioactivity is dispersed throughout the primary system,
MSR primary systems may be required tc have lower leakage rates.

2, Standards for routine release of radioactivity probably should be
modified to reflect the fact that the MSBR fuel cycle involves no
off-site fuel reprocessing or refabrication.

3. The low excess reactivity in the core and the fuel drain capability
may permit modification of requirements for control-rod shutdown
capability.

4, Standards for post-shutdown cooling should be modified te reflect
the fact that most of the afterheat is released in the drain tank
after a drain and that the fuel salt provides considerable thermal
inertia.

5. Maintenance and in-service inspection procedures are likely to
require different standards than for solid-fueled reactors.

After a thorough review of available standards and their adaptability
to MSR's, needs for modified or additional standards will be identified
and preliminary versions will be produced for application to the MSTR.
The design, construction, testing, operation, and maintenance of that
reactor will provide tests of the adequacy of the standards, as well

as of the ability of MSR systems to conform to required standards.

8.6.5 Task 7.3.2 Preparation of standards for MSBR's

 

The standards and codes developed for the MSTR will be reviewed and
revised to meet the needs of the commercial MSBR. This work will be
based on the information and experience developed in preparing earlier
versions of standards and the experience obtained from applying them
to the MSTR. The usual review, trial use, and revision procedures
will be employed in establishing MSBR standards.

8.6.6 Task 7.3.3 Preparation of code cases

 

Hastelloy N was used in the construction of the Molten~Salt Reactor
Experiment which was operated at ORNL between 1965 and 1969, and a
code case was submitted to cover that application. Before the next Ld
reactor can be built, additional code cases must be prepared for the

modified Hastelloy N which will be used. A case must be submitted to

obtain approval of the material as regards ASME Boiler and Pressure

Vessel Code Section III, Case I, Section VIII, and the high temperature ei
application covered in 1331-8, as well as the special section of RDT

standard E-15-2.

It will probably require about two years of further study of the modi-
fied alloy before it will be possible to finalize its formulation. It
is anticipated that two additional years will be required to obtain

data from large commerical heats of the material and to prepare the i
code case (see Section 2, Task 1.4.3).
Additional code cases are also likely to be required. For example, the i

primary materials for the fuel processing plant are probably not covered

by existing cases, and other materials that may be selected may require

special consideration due to the nature of the proposed applications. a
Such cases will be prepared and submitted as required to obtain the

approvals needed for the program.

8.7 TASK GROUP 7.4 LICENSING OF MSR's

 

8.7.1 Objective

All MSR's, including the MSTR and the demonstration reactor, will pre-
sumably be required to meet licensing criteria established for other power i
8-31

reactors. It is, therefore, essential that the first plant te which
these criteria are applied, the MSTR, be designed to comply with all
licensing requirements, or at least the intent of the requirements.
Since MSR's exhibit fundamental differences from solid-fueled reactors,
some of the requirements may have to be "interpreted" to make them
applicable to MSR's. It is the purpose of this task group to examine
the licensing positions of the conceptual MSR's in sufficient detail

to provide reasonable assurance that licensing applications can be acted
upon favorably.

8.7.2 Schedule

The licensing study should begin after a resonably firm conceptual design
has been established for the MSBR in FY 1978 and will continue through

FY 1985 in order to allow review with feedback to the design and develop-
ment effort to continue until the state of the technology is such that a
"trial" license application can be prepared. Depending on the results

of that effort, additional work would probably be required to support

the application for and receipt of the construction permit and operat-
ing approval for the MSTR. The actual preparation of applications for
specific plants are not included in this task group.

8.7.3 Funding

The funding for this task group, Table 8.7.3, is tentatively set at a
low level with additional support to prepare the "trial" application
and to assist in the MSTR applications. As this work proceeds, if
additional needs are identified, it will be necessary to increase the
support for this task group.

8.7.4 Task 7.4.1 Studies of MSBR licensing position

 

The requirements for nuclear plant licensing will be carefully reviewed

to identifv any areas in which special interpretations may be needed to
accommodate the unique features of MSBR's. After development of any such
interpretations, the MSBR conceptual design will be examined to determine
the extent to which it complies with licensing requirements and to iden-
tify any features that might require additional development or modifica-
tion to enhance licensability. When the design and the technology are
judged to be sufficiently well established, a trial set of licensing
documents, including a draft PSAR, would be prepared. These documents
would not be as comprehensive as those needed for a formal license appli-
cation, but they should be adequate to define the basic licensing position
of the reactor. These documents would be reviewed within the program, and
an attempt would be made to obtain review by licensing agencies. Based on
the results of such reviews additional work probably will be required to
further enhance the licensing position so that there can be reasonable
assurance that the MSTR can be approved for operation.

8.8 TASK GROUP 7.5 NUCLEAR ANALYSIS OF MSR POWER PLANTS

8.8.1 Objectives

The objectives of the work in this task group are to provide workable
neutronic designs for molten-salt reactor concepts under study and to
determine the steady-state and transient performance characteristics

of the designs. The design goals, in terms of breeding or conversion,
fuel-cycle performance, power densities, neutron fluxes, physical size,
etc., will be established by other design activities. This task group
also provides for the development of calculational methods that may be
needed to produce results with the required degrees of accuracy and
precision.

8.8.2 Schedule

Neutronic studies (see Table 8.8.2) will be initiated along with the start
of other preliminary conceptual design activities and will continue for
the duration of the design studies te permit needed adjustments and re-
finements of the conceptual designs. The required level of effort is
expected to be relatively low except for brief periods when studies of
new or alternate concepts are initiated. At those times, additional
effort will be expended to support the extra design work.

8.8.3 Funding

The funding required to support the anticipated nuclear analysis work
is shown in Table 8.8.3.

8.8.4 Task 7.5.1 Analysis of 1000-MW(e) MSBR's

Computer codes and methods for static nuclear analyses of MSBR's are
fairly well established, but as these studies continue, the codes will
be revised as necessary and cross-section libraries updated. All anal-
yses of MSBR's will be made to optimize one or more design parameters.
Studies will include optimization of fuel-cycle cost, breeding perfor-
mance, fuel inventory, doubling time, and chemical processing rate.
These studies will also provide data on core reactivity coefficients
and other properties that are important in the reactor kinetic behavior.
Additional computations will then be made to define the kinetic response
of the core to anticipated transient conditions. The models used for
such computations and some of the results will be incorporated in more
comprehensive models to examine the dynamic behavior of entire MSBR
systems.

8.8.5 Task 7.5.2 Control studies of MSBR plants

 

Control studies of these plants involve many areas. With respect to
neutronic processes, experience with two experimental MSR's showed that
they were easily controlled, and this is expected to be the case for
larger cores. However, plant control involves a great deal of inter-
action between the neutronic processes and other parts of the system.
These interactive control processes for steady operation, normal maneu-
vering, and upset conditions will be extensively studied with the aid
of analog, hybrid, and digital computer techniques to ensure that the
conceptual designs provide adequately for control needs. This task
interfaces strongly with Task Group 11.1 (see Section 12).

8.8.6 Task 7.5.3 Analysis of alternate MSR designs

 

Alternate MSR's are of two basic types, converters and plutonium burners.
A uranium burner which uses no fertile thorium is of course possible,
but would probably have little practical use. It is believed preferable
to incorporate thorium in a uranium-fueled reactor and achieve some con-
version. Non-breeder types of MSR's would be investigated in order to
determine their probable economic impact. Analyses would be done to
determine fuel-cycle costs and the performance of reactors designed for
maximum simplicity and minimum capital cost.

There are potential uses for MSR's other than central station power
generation. Many industries require large quantities of process steam
at temperatures which suggest the use of MSR's for steam production.

A parametric study of reactors of various sizes would be made to de-
termine the economics of heat sources of this type.

Analyses of these alternate MSR's will be done following the breeder
analyses, since MSBR development comprises the main line effort of the
program.

8.8.7 Task 7.5.4 Computer code development

8.8.7.1 Subtask 7.5.4.1 Static calculations

 

Currently available methods for performing reactor statics calculations
appear to be adequate for MSR conceptual design purposes, and no develop-
ment of statics codes, per se, is anticipated. A general design code
(ROD} is also available to perform parameter and fuel cycle studies. This
code could be modified tc a two-dimensional model in order to better ana-
lyze a multi-region reactor core. While the ENDF cross-section library

is expected to be adequate for design calculations, sensitivity analyses
would be done to determine the effect on neutron economy of uncertainties
in the cross section data.

8.8.7.2 Subtask 7.5.4.2 Dynamic reactor calculations

It is possible that additional codes will be needed to handle the kinetic
or dynamic analyses that will be needed for large MSR's. There are many
transient and off-design calculations for which nuclear analyses must be
performed, and this task provides for the development of programs to sup-
ply the analysis capability.

9. GRAPHITE DEVELOPMENT

9.1 INTRODUCTION

The graphite in a single-fluid MSBR serves no structural purpcse other
than to define the flow patterns of the salt and, of course, to support
forces resulting from its own weight and momentum transfer from the
flowing salt. The requirements on the material are dictated most strongly
by nuclear considerations, namely stability of the material against
radiation-induced distortion, nonpenetrability by the fuel-bearing molten
salt, and nonabsorption of xenon into the graphite. The practical limita-
tions on meeting these requirements in turn impose conditions on the

core design, specifically the necessity to provide for periodic graphite
replacement and to limit the cross-sectional area of the graphite prisms.

9.1.1 Objective

The primary objectives of this activity are to develop a core moderator
graphite having good dimensional stability under neutron irradiation and
a low permeability to 135%e which can be produced commercially at an
acceptable cost,

9.1.2 Scope

The scope of this work will include studies of a basic nature concerning
damage mechanisms, fabrication studies to develop graphite with improved
dimensional stability, development of sealing methods for reducing the
permeability of the graphite to 135%e, and measurements of the physical
properties of graphites having potential for MSBR application.

9.1.2.1 Task Group 8.1 Basic graphite studies

 

These studies will be concerned with basic irradiation damage mechanisms
in graphite. Single crystals will be used to determine the types and
numbers of defects produced during irradiation. Annealing kinetics will
be observed by transmission electronmicroscepy.

9.1.2.2 Task Group 8.2 Graphite base stock development

 

This work will involve a study of the basic raw materials and fabricat-—
ion processes used in making graphite. Commercial and experimental
graphites will be characterized and irradiated, and dimensional and
physical property changes will be measured. The goal will be to corre-
late starting material and fabrication variables with dimensional
stability during irradiation.
9-2

9.1.2.3 Task Group 8.3 Sealing of graphite for permeability reduction

 

The absorption of 135%e by the core graphite can result in reduction of
the breeding ratio. Most of the 135%e will be removed from the fuel

salt by contact of the salt with helium, but it will likely be necessary
to reduce the permeability of the graphite to prevent absorption of

xenon by the graphite. It is likely that graphite with surface perme-
abilities as low as 1078 cm?/sec will be required, and this low permea-
bility can only be obtained by (a) surface coating the graphite with
pyocarbon, (b) impregnating the graphite with carbon, or (c¢) impregnating
the graphite with salt. All of these techniques will be pursued to

some extent.

9.1.2.4 Task Group 8.4 Physical properties

 

The physical properties of graphite cover a wide range of values due to
the large number of starting materials and fabrication techniques used
in making graphite. The physical properties of graphite provide useful
information about the crystallographic structure and other properties.
Similarly, the changes in physical properties during irradiation provide
information about the crystallographic changes taking place. Thus
physical properties such as thermal expansion, thermal conductivity,
and electrical resistivity are very useful for characterizing graphites
and for evaluating structural changes during irradiation. The changes
of these properties are also of direct importance to the design of a
reactor core, since they affect dimensional behavior and heat transfer.
Work will be carried out in which graphite samples are alternately
irradiated and physical properties measured.

9.1.2.5 Task Group 8.5 Evaluation tests for MSBR graphite

Several tests must be made on the grade of graphite chosen for a
molten-salt test reactor. The work carried out in Task Group 8.1 through
8.4 will have involved small samples. Tests of a proof nature will be
run on large pieces having the full cross-section of a moderator element.
These tests will include long-term irradiation tests on uncoated and
coated elements, and subsequent evaluation of the irradiated specimens.

9.2 PROGRAM BUDGET AND SCHEDULE

9.2.1 Schedule and key program milestones

 

The schedule for work on graphite development is shown in Table 9.2.1.1.

The key program milestones for this activity are listed in Table 9.2.1.2
and occur at the times shown in Table 9.2.1.1.

9.2.2 Budget

The operating fund requirements for this activity are shown in Table
9.2.2.1, and the capital equipment fund requirements are shown in Table
9.2.2.2. This includes capital equipment funds in the amount of $300,000
in both FY 1980 and FY 1981 for construction of two facilities for in~-
reactor irradiation of large moderator graphite sections.

9.3 MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS, BACKGROUND, AND STATUS OF DEVELOPMENT

9.3.1 Material requirements

 

Graphite used in the highest power density portion of the core of the
reference design MSBR will be exposed to flowing fuel salt at tempera-
tures up to 1300°F, will receive fast neutron fluences of about 3 X 1022
neutrons/cm?, and will be in contact with fuel salt containing 135%e.

It is necessary that the graphite be chemically inert to the salt, that
it maintain reasonable dimensional stability and integrity during ex-
posure to this high neutron fluence, and that it have a low permeability
to 13%%e under the operating conditions.

Salt and graphite have been shown to be compatible by numerous exper-
iments with the most convincing proof being the operation cf the MSRE.
Graphite removed from the MSRE after 5 years of operation retained
preinstallation machining marks and documented surface imperfections.
Salt penetration into the graphite is prevented by surface tension
forces if the entrance pore diameters to the internal void structure of
the graphite are of the order of 1 um or less. Seepage of fuel salt
into the graphite would lead to local hot spots which could easily attain
temperatures of 1100-1200°C at which the graphite damage rate is in-
creased by a factor of two over that at 700°C.2 Fortunately the pore
size requirement is easily met by many high-quality, fine-grained
graphites, and this requirement leads to no design or material
restrictions.

Radiation damage in graphite has been studied extensively since 1945
relative to the Hanford production reactors, and more recently under the
various European and American gas-cooled-reactor programs.> In the mid
1960's it became increasingly apparent that graphite has a finite life-
time in a fast neutron environment, and that the anisotropically induced

crystallite growth resulting from irradiation damage ultimately causes
gross dimensional changes in the polycrystalline bulk material. The
fluence that is defined as the useful lifetime of the graphite depends
somewhat on the failure criterion employed. The gradual deterioration
of the material would first be reflected in increased xenon absorption,
followed by salt penetration and eventually loss of mechanical integrity.
The definition presently used, that the material undergo no significant
radiation-induced bulk expansion, is certainly a conservative assump-
tion. If the graphite lifetime were to be equal to the design plant
life of the reference design MSBR (which has a peak power density of
100 wattsfem®), the graphite would experience a damage fluence of about
3 x 1023 neutrons-cm™ 2, which is about ten times what the best material
will withstand.

The approach for excluding 135%e from the interior of the graphite with
its attendant improvement in breeding ratio is discussed in detail in
Section 8. Translated to a materials requirement, however, xenon ex-
clusion implies effective gas permeabilities of 1078 cm?/sec helium

STP or lower, which requires maximum pore entrance diameters of 0.01

um or less. Such pore sizes are not attainable in the ordinary fabri-
cation of bulk graphite. The requirement can be easily met by pyrolytic
deposition of carbon onto a bulk graphite, although it has not yet been
demonstrated that such coatings have adequate irradiation stability.

The existence of a graphite lifetime which is lower than the desired
plant life forces the reactor designer to accept low power densities or
to make provisions for pericdic removal of the graphite. The latter
approach has been adopted for the reference design MSBR as discussed in
Section 8. The requirement for salt exclusion, and thereby a fine-
grained graphite, also determines that the geometric cross section cf
the graphite prisms be kept low. This is necessitated by the inability
to control microstructure to the desired degree in forming and heat-
treating graphite members having large cross sections. Small cross
sections also have the advantage of minimizing thermal gradients in the
graphite during reactor operation and thus reducing the rate at which
radiation damage occurs.

In the several MSR design studies carried out to date, the problems of
graphite removal and prism geometry have been approached in several
different ways." ® Mechanical analyses’ have indicated there are no
significant thermal or radiation-induced stresses in graphite in any
of the designs.

9.3.2 Background
9.3.2.1 General

Graphite has been employed as a nuclear material for as long as there have
been reactors. It formed the moderator in the Stagg Field experiment
and in the prototype Oak Ridge Graphite Reactor. The first extemsive
 

9-9

experience with graphite was acquired in the Hanford production reactors
and somewhat later in the British gas-cooled reactors, albeit at lower
temperatures and fluences than apply to MSR's.

More recently the Dragon Reactor initiated the use of graphite at
temperatures in the 1000°C range, followed shortly by the Peach Bottom
Reactor in the U.S. and the AVR Reactor in Germany. Currently, gas-
cooled reactors are being designed or operated which have graphite
temperatures in the 1200-1300°C temperature range.

Much of the experience and data obtained in the gas-cooled reactor pro-
gram is directly applicable to MSR's. In particular, data obtained at
Hanford in the mid-1960's spanning the temperature range 300-1100°C
first indicated the finite lifetime of graphite resulting from neutron-
induced damage, i.e., its eventual dimensional expansion and loss of
mechanical integrity.

In late 1968, a program was initiated at ORNL to evaluate graphites

for melten-salt breeder reactor application, and more specifically, te
determine what limitations improved graphite might impose on reactor
design. A development program was proposed? to demonstrate feasibility
of improving graphite by 1975, and to bring such improvements to com-
merical application by 1980. However, the development program has not
been fully implemented due to funding limitations. Nevertheless, con-
siderable progress has been achieved toward demonstrating the capability
of existing materials to meet MSBR requirements and to delineate areas
for future development.

9.3.2.2 Basic graphite studies

Techniques were developed at ORNL for irradiating graphite with electrons
in an electronmicroscope and simultaneously observing the structural
changes as they occurred. Techniques were also developed for controlling
the specimen temperature, so that annealing and clustering of defects
could be observed. The studies carried out showed that the reported
value for the displacement energy for carbon atoms in a graphite lattice
was likely in error. This physics parameter is basic in predicting the
number of atomic displacements caused by a primary knock-on.

9.3.2.3 Irradiation damage studies

The basic irradiation damage phenomena in graphite arise from the extreme
anisotropy of the crystal. The carbon atoms are arrayed in tightly

bound hexagons in planar array. The planes are well-separated and weakly
coupled. Interstitials produced by neutron bombardment move freely
between planes and reintegrate as new planes. Vacancies left behind are
collapsed. One is thus left with the picture of a single crystal ex-
panding indefinitely in one direction and contracting in the other two
with little change in net volume. Thus, in a polycrystalline material,
9-10

each crystallite is expanding and contracting in varying directions, and
it is hardly surprising that the material eventually deteriorates. What
is remarkable is its ability to withstand these changes. Partially
oriented pyrolytic graphites irradiated in HFIR to fluences of 3 x 1022
neutrons/cm? at MSR temperatures expanded 500% in the preferred c-axis
direction without losing mechanical integrity!

During the period 1963-1971, over eighty different experimental and
commercially available graphites were irradiated in HFIR to establish
their dimensional behavior.? An understanding of the microstructural
properties of graphite that are of significance to radiation damage has
gradually emerged, and can be summarized as follows:

In the 600 tc 800°C temperature range of interest to molten-salt
breeder reactors, bulk graphites can be classified into three
behavior modes depending on their fabrication history, namely
conventional materials, black-based materials, and monolithic
materials.® Conventional materials include all normal commercial
graphites that are formed from calcined coke or graphite fillers,
bindered with thermosetting or thermoplastic materials, and sub-
sequently heat treated. These materials may be isotropic or
anisotropic, but show an immediate volume contraction during
irradiation followed by rapid and catastrophic expansion. Their
lifetimes are in the range from 1 to 2.3 x 1022 neutroms/cm?

(E > 50 keV). The rate of volume expansion is characteristically
parabolic with increasing fluence.

The second class, black-based graphites, employs carbon blacks as
fillers. The individual blacks have a roughly spherical crystal-
lite shape which is capable of withstanding high tangential strain.
Depending on heat treatment temperature, these materials will first
contract rapidly and then expand linearly with further irradiation.
The difference in the expansion behavior from that of the more
conventional graphites is tentatively explained by the ability of
the black particles to withstand strain.

The third class, and the one of interest for MSBR applications,

is the monolithic materials which appear to be binderless, or for
which the filler material is chemically active and reacts with the
binder. The result is an extremely homogeneous structure that is
usually unmarked by microstructures. Under irradiation, these
materials underge a prolonged stable induction period before
beginning a parabolic expansion period. The lifetimes of graphites
of this class tested to date lie in the range of 2 to 3 X 102
neutrons/cm? (E > 50 keV). The best materials of this type

are invariably isotropic, and their induction period is attributed
to their high micrestrength and ability to flow plastically to
relieve strain. The parabolic expansion of these materials and of
the conventional graphites can be related to void generation as
the structure finally fractures at the crystallite level.l0

 
 

9-11

In summary, the general nature of damage in polycrystalline graphite is
understood, and its relationship to microstructure is at least
qualitatively demonstrated.

9.3.2.4 Fabrication studies

Based on the HFIR irradiation data, a program was initiated in 1970 to
explore the fabrication of monolithic graphites with the specific aim
of improving irradiation damage resistance. Small samples up to three
inches in diameter were used, and the raw materials were limited to
three cokes and several thermosetting or thermoplastic binders. The
essence of the improved fabrication process is in the use of cokes in
their uncalcined condition in which they are still chemically active.
The chemical interaction between coke and binder and the similar
shrinkage rates of the two during carbonization result in the desired
monolithic structure.l

These materials have undergone irradiation testing to fluence levels as

high as 1.5 x 1022 neutrons/cm?. To this level, the materials have been
stable, and thus confirm our conclusions from hypotheses based on damage
models.

9.3.2.5 Stresses and creep

The graphite core prisms in an MSBR are required for no structural pur-
pose except to delineate the salt flow paths and to support their own
weight when the reactor primary circuit is drained. However, the
question remains as to the magnitude of thermal or radiation-~induced
stresses. These have been calculated with the reference design MSBR for
conventional graphite at the worst position in the core, i.e., on the
core center line just above the midplane.® The calculated stresses are
quite low and can be neglected. It is thus concluded that thermal and
radiation-induced stresses are no problem even for the relatively poorly
behaved conventional graphites for fluence levels up to the defined
graphite lifetime (the time at which the fluence level reaches that
required to cause expansion of the bulk graphite beyond its initial
volume).

9.3.2.6 Sealing to prevent xenon absorption

 

The approach used to effectively seal graphite with respect to xenon
permeation takes three forms: direct impregnation by hydrocarbons
followed by heat treatment to leave a carbon relic in the pore, surface
treatment to seal the pores at or near the surface, or impregnation
with a liquid or solid salt to fill the pores.
9-12

Sufficient experience exists in the graphite industry to indicate the
limitations of direct carbonaceous impregnation. The decemposing hydro-
carbon generates gaseous products which must escape to the surface or i
produce rupture in the bulk graphite. The lowest practical xenon
permeability which can be achieved by this approach is of the order of
10=¢ cm?/sec, which is a factor 100 larger than required for adequately

excluding xenon from MSBR graphite. This approach has therefore not =
been explored further in the MSR program.
The use of salts to fill the pores of the graphite has been locked at =

cursorily® and is still being considered. The difficulty anticipated

with this approach is that uranium may diffuse into the salt from the

fuel salt. Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that such a technique is
can reduce gas permeabilities to the desired range.

The use of pyrolytic decomposition of hydrocarbons has been extensively
studied for reactor applications, primarily under the gas-cocled reactor
programs. The background information on process parameters, properties,
and irradiation behavior developed in that work forms the basis for the
current work related to MSBR's. The first approach, !? utilizing a gas =
impregnation process to £ill the pores near the :=2xternal surface of the
graphite, was initially preferred over a coating process because of the
greater resistance which the resulting graphite would have to handling
damage. The process consists of alternately exposing the graphite to
hydrocarbon gas and vacuum, thus effecting decomposition of the gas deep
within the pores of the graphite. This approach has proven to be easily
controllable and effective, and apparent permeabilities™ in the 10-8

ew? /sec range and below are readily attained. Monolithic-type substrates
were impregnated and irradiated in HFIR, however, a rapid increase in

permeability during irradiation was observed.l3® Dimensional measurement di
data readily indicated that in filling the pores the crystallites in the

surface region of the base graphite had also been locked together which

prevented the plastic flow necessary to relieve the intercrystalline EE
strains produced during damage.

Coating of graphite was next investigated, utilizing base graphites and
coating structures known to be dimensionally stable under irradiation.

The initial irradiation rasults?® indicated limited success; a few samples
retained their initial lows permeabilities tc the maximum fluence employed,
about 2 x 1022 neutrons/cm?, but the majority had permeabilities which £5
were no better than that of the unimpregnated materials. It is now known
that the coatings were flawed before irradiation, and a revised coating
process was developed.l®

*

The permeabilities as used here are derived from gas flow measurements

through both the sealed region and the remaining unaffected substrate

graphite. The actual permeabilities at the sealed surface layer are

probably a factor of 100 lower. i
 

 

9-13

One of the recent major diagnostic advances has been development of
scanning electron microscopes that are capable of examining graphite
surfaces. The flawed samples alluded to above appeared perfectly sound
under even the light microscope. However, under the scanning electron
microscope, various types of flaws were readily apparent as well as
changes in microstructure. The defects were found to be due to faulty
gas circulation, scot inclusions, and the presence of sharp corners on
the graphite cylinders being coated. It is believed that these factors
have been eliminated in the current coating process, however, this has
not been verified by irradiation of test samples.

9.3.2.7 Thermal conductivity measurements

 

It was anticipated initially that changes in thermal conductivity due
to radiation damage under MSR conditions would be slight. Recent data,
however, have implied this may not be the case,’ and experiments have
been initiated in HFIR to determine the extent of the degradation in
conductivity.® Preliminary results imply the conductivity may decrease
to about one third of the initial value.

The thermal conductivity of graphite is important in controlling the
internal graphite temperatures, and thereby the rate of irradiation
damage accumulation. The average dimensional change observed for a
graphite prism undergoing radiation damage is essentially equal to that
which would be observed if the prism were at its mean temperature
throughout. ’ Since damage rate increases with increasing temperature,
it is desirable to minimize internal temperature gradients.

9.3.2.8 Manufacturing capability and costs

An extensive survey of various commercial graphites identified one
graphite that is acceptable for the MSBR reference design, a second
graphite that is acceptable but available only in limited sizes, and
two other graphites which are potentially acceptable. Fortuitously,
these graphites involve four separate vendors.

Great Lakes Carbon Corporation's grade H-364 is available in the desired
geometries and possesses a lifetime (before significant expansion occurs)
of the order of 2.5 x 1022 neutrons/cm? (E > 50 KeV) at 715°C. This is
17% less than the graphite life specified in the reference design but is
close enough to be compensatable by allowing more expansion, reducing
the maximum power density, or replacing the graphite somewhat earlier.
Poco grade AXF is the best commercial material which has been encountered
and has a lifetime of the order of 3 to 3.5 x 1022, but this material is
currently available only in short lengths. Material submitted by Airco
Speer and Pure Carbon Companies may also fall into the class of these
graphites but to date these materials have been irradiated to a fluence
of only 1.5 x 1022. Their behavior appears to be similar to that of

the best of the monolithic grades.
9-14

It has not been possible to obtain firm price estimates on the four
grades of graphite which are potentially acceptable for the reference
design MSBR, but they appear to fall into the range of $5 to $10 per
pound of finished graphite, even on a first-order basis. Prices of $5
per pound cor lower appear to be probable if the market becomes suffi-
ciently large to permit the graphite tc be handled as a stock item.

With regard to pyrolytic coating or sealing, there is an existing in-
dustry already producing such coatings primarily for aerospace appli-
cations. However, the most irradiation-resistant type of coating (LTI,
or low temperature isotropic) is produced using process parameters quite
different from those in use by the existing industrial firm. Estimating
the cost of coating operation is difficult since a process has not been
developed, but it is believed that $25 to $30 per 1b of finished graphite
for the proposed slab geometry should cover the coating operation during
its early development. Eventually, coating costs should drop to $5 to

$7 per 1b for production quantities.

9.3.3 Status of development

A number of uncertainties remain, none of which particularly affect the
viability of the molten-salt breeder concept. These uncertainties may
effect further compromises in design and perhaps economics, but in no
case are they vital to the technical or economic use of graphite in the
reactor. These uncertainties appear to be resolvable by further work
on graphite development.

9.3.3.1 Irradiation damage and graphite fabrication

The potential for developing improved graphites that can be employed by
MSBR's at fluence levels beyond 3.5 X 1022 is high. A question remains
concerning the degree of improvement to be anticipated. Confidence that
at least incremental improvements can be made has increased significantly
with improved understanding of the relationships between micro-structure
and irradiation damage. The availability of HFIR (or fast reactors in
the future) in which fluences can be attained in less than a year that
are equivalent to those for an MSBR after several years enables a
graphite development program to proceed at a reasonable rate.

The graphite fabrication process which is currently being studied at ORNL
has been explored only briefly. Areas awaiting examination where further
progress can be anticipated involve the use of blacks in processes anal-
ogous to the green-coke route, and the use of high-pressure processing
for both raw materials and carbonization. To date very little effort

has been expended by industry and other government laboratories toward
increasing the life or stability of graphite, and the development of new
processes and diagnostic techniques suggest that much more rapid progress
can be made. The alternate fabrication techniques and their relevance

to damage resistance can be at least indicated within two or three years
 

 

9-15

after work is initiated. The fact that pyrolytic materials have survived
to fluences greater than 1.5 x 1022 neutrons/cm? implies that lifetimes
of the order of 5 x 1022 neutrons/cm? at 700°C should be attainable.

9.3.3.2 Xenon control

The ability to exclude xenon from graphite in the MSBR core by means of
pyrolytic graphite impregnation or coating has not been demonstrated.
Alternative sealing techniques exist but currently remain unexplored.

Both coatings and substrates have been shown separately to survive to
fluence values greater than 3 x 10°2. Hence, this is strong reason to
believe that a coating will be satisfactory for the MSBR. However, in
the gas-cooled reactor program, where coatings have been shown to sur-
vive equivalent fluences, it has been found necessary to decouple the
substrate and coating. Both low density pyrolytic and silicon carbide
intercoatings have been employed, and analogous techniques could possibly
be utilized here. If such techniques are required, a period of two to
three years would be needed for their development. In any event, fur-
ther work to scaleup sealing methods and prepare for transition to
commercial suppliers will be required.

Two alternate sealing techniques involve filling the porosity in the
graphite with liquid or solid salt. Uncertainty remains as to whether
the diffusivity of xenon in the liquid or solid is sufficiently low and
whether uranium transfers rapidly between the fuel salt and the impreg-
nant salt. The potential of this approach could be determined in about
one year.

Underlying all of the work on graphite sealing are questions related to
the rate at which xenon will be transported into the graphite quite
independent of its permeability. For example, the current uncertainty
in the mass transfer coefficient between the fuel salt and helium
bubbles allows the possibility that unsealed graphite may be acceptable.
Information on this and other factors affecting xenon removal will be
studied in an existing facility (Gas Systems Technology Facility) that
is full scale for a 150-MW(t) MSR (see Section 10).

9.3.3.3 Thermal conductivity

The degradation of thermal conductivity with increasing fluence level
remains to be established, and this leaves uncertain the maximum cross-—
sectional area of graphite prisms that will be acceptable in an MSBR.
Although representing only a question of design, it must be answered.
9-16

9.3.3.4 Stresses and creep

Present knowledge on creep in graphite leads to an analysis indicating
that only trivial stresses are developed in the graphite. Recent
unpublished results obtained at Hanford may indicate that the ability of
graphite to creep deteriorates at high fluences. If so, the problem can
likely be avoided by changes in design, but the situation is uncertain
and requires additional study.

5.3.3.5 General evaluation

In general, graphite presents no serious problem to the molten-salt
breeder reactor. At least one vendor can supply a satisfactory material
in the required sizes, and there is every reason to believe the lifetime
of future graphites can be extended to perhaps twice that of the best
existing materials. Cost estimates utilizing present material capabili-
ties yield 0.17 mill/kWhr for replacement of the entire core on a four-
year cycle in the reference design, or a somewhat lower cost if only the
most highly irradiated material is replaced. Increasing the lifetime to
eight years reduces the contribution to fuel cycle cost by about 0.1
mill/kWhr. Thus, existing base graphites are acceptable, and future
graphites can probably be developed to reduce replacement costs.

The present methods for pyrolytically ceating graphite appear promising.

Alternative routes exist, but the question is eventually one of economics —

the value of marginal increases in breeding gain versus the cost of the
coated material.

Sufficient data on the thermal and mechanical properties of graphites
of the type required for the MSBR have not been obtained in the un-
irradiated and irradiated conditions. Enough is known to be certain
that mechanical properties do not affect the exact shapes of graphite
permitted nor the means by which the graphite is supported, but addi-
tional data must be secured for design purposes.

9.4 TASK GROUP 8.1 BASIC GRAPHITE STUDIES

These studies will be concerned with determining basic radiation damage
mechanisms in graphite. Single crystals will be used to determine the
types and numbers of defects produced by irradiation. Annealing kinetics
will be observed by transmission electromicroscopy.

The objective of this task will be to determine the basic mechanisms of
radiation damage and annealing for graphite.

9.4.5 Task 8.1.1 Irradiation damage and annealing in graphite single
crystals

High purity single crystals of graphite will be irradiated with electrons
in an electron microscope. The number and morphology of the defects

will be determined at various temperatures. Some of the ‘'damaged"

samples will be held at temperature and the annealing of defects observed.
This work should result in an accurate value for the energy required to
displace a carbon atom from the graphite lattice. Quantitative informa-
tion should be obtained sbout irradiation damage and annealing in graphite
single crystals.

Impurities are known to be important in stablizing irradiation-produced
defects in graphite. Impurities will be added to graphite single crys-—
tals and their effects on damage and annealing kinetics determined.

9.4.6 Task 8.1.2 Irradiation damage and annealing in polycrystalline
graphite

 

The presence of grain boundaries in graphite complicates irradiation
damage mechanisms over those occurring in single crystals. The boundary
serves as both source and sink for defects and as a surface to stablize
planar defects. It is anticipated that grain size and the angular mis-
match between adjacent grains will be important variables and a system-
atic study will be made of their influence.

9.5.5 Task 8.2.1 Evaluation of commerical graphites

 

Numerous grades of graphite are made commerically in the US and foreign
countries. Research quantities of the more desirable materials will be
procured and evaluated. Evaluation will include measuring several
physical properties such as pore size spectrum, gas permeability, crys-
talline anisotropy, density, electrical conductivity, and coefficient

of thermal expansion in the unirradiated condition. The most attractive
materials will be irradiated and the dimensional changes observed as

a function of fluence.

9.5.5.1 Subtask 8.2.1.1 Vendor liaison and procurement

The manufacture of graphite is a highly specialized and proprietary
operation. Continued liaison with the commerical vendors is required

to keep them knowledgeable and interested in the MSR Program needs. In
some cases, graphites of potential use are currently in production. In
other cases vendors can modify an existing formulation or fabrication
process to obtain a graphite useful for MSBR applications. Quite often a
commerical graphite will be of interest primarily because of the raw

material used or because of the fabrication process used. Research
quantities of numerous products will be procured for evaluation in
Subtasks 8.2.1.2 and 8.2.1.3.

9.5.5.2 Subtask 8.2.1.2 Characterization of commerical graphites

 

The commerical graphites obtained in Subtask 8.2.1.1 will be subjected

to several characterization tests in the unirradiated condition including
pore size spectrum, gas permeability, crystalline anisotropy, density,
electrical conductivity, and coefficient of thermal expansion. Some
graphites will likely be excluded from further testing by these results.
For materials that are carried futher, test results will serve as
baseline information.

9.5.5.3 Subtask 8.2.1.3 Irradiation of commerical graphites

 

The graphites used for irradiation tests will be chosen on the basis of
attractive properties as indicated by work in Subtask 8.2.1.2 or because
they involve raw materials or fabrication processes of interest. Small
cylindrical samples will be machined for irradiation in HFIR. The
samples will be removed periodically for dimensional measurements. Some
samples will be subjected to measurements such as density and pore spec—
trum as the irradiation schedule proceeds. The range of experimental
variables will include temperatures of 500 toc 800°C and fast fluences

up to 3.5 x 1022 neutrons/em?.

9.5.6 Task 8.2.2 Development and evaluation of experimental graphites

Previous studies have given encouragement that graphites with improved
dimensional stability can be developed. There is little financial in-
centive at this time for commerical graphite fabricators to develop such

a product, and the work will be pursued by the MSR Program. Research
quantities of graphite will be produced using well-characterized materials
and processes. Samples will be carried through evaluation steps similar
to those described for Task 8.2.1.

9.5.6.1 Subtask 8.2.2.1 Choice of raw materials

Several types of raw materials are used in fabricating graphite. Some
of these materials are highly graphitic (crystalline) and others are
almost amorphous. The less-graphitic materials were once thought to
adversely affect irradiation behavior, but recent studies indicate that
this is not the case under MSBR conditions. The combined use of highly
graphitic and amorphous materials appears attractive. The integrity of
the binder material is very important and it appears that the so-called
"binderless graphites' may be more resistant to loss of cohesion or
cracking between individual graphite particles. However, the "binderless
graphites" undergo large dimensional changes during fabricaticn, and
9-26

techniques must be developed for accommodating these changes. The choice
of raw materials will alsc be based on information from Subtasks 8.2.2.2
through 8.2.2.4.

9.5.6.2 Subtask 8.2.2.2 Study of fabrication processes

 

Forward extrustion, molding, and forward extrusion with back pressure

are the most common methods used for final graphite forming. However,
the entire process flowsheet involves a myriad of heating, mixing, crush-
ing, and sizing steps. One of the key factors appears to be the choice
of these processing variables such that the finished product is isotropic
on the smallest scale possible. That is, graphite which is isotropic

on the basis of relatively large particles has inferior dimensional
stability to that which is isotropic on the basis of the small crystal-
lites within the particles. This subtask will be involved with study

of the entire fabrication flowsheet, and its function will be to supply
material for the following two subtasks.

9.5.6.3 Subtask 8.2.2.3 Characterization of experimental graphites

 

The graphites produced in the above subtask will be subjected to a pro-
gression of evaluation tests. The first tests will be involved only

with assessing structural integrity. The subsequent tests will involve
determination cof bulk density, pore size spectrum, and crystalline
anisotropy. Additional tests such as coefficient of thermal expansion,
electrical conductivity, and gas permeability may be run on some of the
best grades. This information will be used in Subtasks 8.2.2.1 and
8.2.2.2. The more attractive materials will be tested further in Subtask
8.2.2.4.

9.5.6.4 Subtask 8.2.2.4 Irradiation of experimental graphites

 

The graphites for irradiation will be chosen on the basis of attractive
properties as indicated by the tests in Subtask 8.2.2.3 or because

they involve raw materials or fabrication processes of interest. Small
cylindrical samples will be machined for irradiation in HFIR. The
samples will be removed periodically for dimensional measurements. Some
samples will be subjected to measurements including density and pore
spectrum as the irradiation schedule proceeds. The range of experimental
variables will include temperatures of 500 to 800°C and fast fluences

up to 3.5 x 1022 peutrons/cm?.

9.6 TASK GROUP 8.3 SEALING GRAPHITE TO REDUCE PERMEABILITY

The absorption of 135%e by the core graphite can result in a significant
reduction in breeding performance. Most of the 135%e will be removed

from the fuel salt by contact with helium bubbles, but it will likely be
necessary to reduce the permeability of the graphite in order to prevent

 
 

9-27

the absorption of xenon. It is likely that graphite having surface
permeabilities of about 108 cm?/sec will be required, and this low
permeability can only be obtained by (a) impregnating the graphite with
salt, (b) impregnating the graphite with carbon, or (c) surface coating
the graphite with pyrocarbon. All of these techniques will be studied
to some extent.

9.6.1 Objective

The objective of this task is to develop a process for decreasing the
permeability of graphite moderator elements with respect to 135%e to
acceptably low values (about 1078 cm?/sec).

9.6.2 Schedule

The schedule for work in this task group is shown in Table 9.6.2.

9.6.3 Funding

Operating fund requirements for this task group are shown in Table
9.6.3.1, and capital equipment fund requirements are shown in Table
9.6.3.2.

9.6.4 Facilities

Several laboratories in Bldg. 4508 will be used for the development of
sealing techniques. Samples will be irradiated in HFIR, remecved from
the experimental capsule in the hot cells in Bldg. 3026D, and returned
to Bldg. 4508 for permeability measurements.

9.6.5 Task 8.3.1 Salt impregnation

Salt containing LiF and BeF, will be forced into graphite by gas over-
pressure. The permeability of helium through the impregnated graphite
will be measured over the temperature range of 500 to 700°C. If the
impregnated graphite has a suitably low helium permeability, tests will
be carried out to determine the rate of transfer of uranium from a
surrounding fuel salt into the impregnated graphite. Results from these
two tests must be available before further work on this sealing technique
can be planned.

9.6.6 Task 8.3.2 Carbon impregnation
Previous studies have shown that graphite can be sealed by impregnation

with carbon deposited from a gaseous mixture. However, subsequent
irradiation tests revealed that the useful lifetime of the graphite was

shortened by the presence of the impregnant. This technique can likely
be used only if the penetration of the deposited carbon is very slight
and the base graphite does not contract appreciably during irradiation.
This technique for sealing graphite would be pursued at a very low level
with variations in impregnation technique and base stock. Irradiation
in HFIR with periodic gas permeability measurements will be the prime
method of evaluation.

9.6.7 Task 8.3.3 Carbon coatings

 

Pyrocarbon coatings have been placed on graphite with moderate success.
Dense impervious coatings can be formed, but their helium permeability
increases during irradiation. Many of the failures were traced to flaws
in the coating; hence, emphasis will be placed on developing coating
techniques which minimize flaws. Only one graphite substrate was studied
previously (POCO AXF), and other materials will be included in future
studies. Samples will be irradiated in HFIR and removed periodically

for permeability measurements.

The potential of using decoupled coatings will be studied. The first
pyrocarbon layer will be of low density and easily deformable. The
second layer will be of high density and impervious to xenon. Techniques
will be developed for applying this type of coating, and coated samples
will be irradiated. Evaluation will be made by periodic removal of the
samples for permeability measurements.

Scaled~up coating techniques will be developed for the most attractive
process. The coatings must ultimately be applied to moderator elements
several feet long, and multiple injectors will be necessary for obtain-
ing satisfactory coatings.

9.7 TASK GROUP 8.4 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES

The physical properties of graphite cover a wide range due to the large
number of starting materials and fabrication techniques used in graphite
manufacture. The physical properties provide useful information about
the crystallographic structure and other properties. Similarly, the
changes in physical properties during irradiation provide information
about the crystallographic changes which occur. Thus, physical proper-
ties such as thermal expansion, thermal conductivity, and electrical
resistivity are very useful for characterizing graphite and for evalu-
ating structural changes during irradiation. The changes of these
properties are also of direct importance tc the design of a reactor core,
since they affect dimensional behavior and heat transfer. A program
will be carried on in which graphite samples are alternately irradiated
and physical properties measured.
9-32

9.7.1 Objective

The objective of this task group is to determine how irradiation changes we
the physical properties of graphite.

9.7.2 Schedule [2s
The schedule for work in this task group is shown in Table 9.7.2.

9.7.3 Funding

Operating fund requirements for this task group are given in Table
9.7.3.1 and capital equipment fund requirements are given in Table

9.7.3.2.

9.7.4 Facilities

This work will make use of the Physical Properties Laboratory in Bldg.
4508. Samples will be irradiated in HFIR, removed from the irradiation

capsule in the hot cells in Bldg. 3026, and returned to Bldg. 4508 for wi
postirradiation measurements. o
9.7.5 Task 8.4.1 Thermal conductivity measurements i

 

The thermal conductivity of the core graphite will have a direct bearing
on the peak temperature in the graphite. The rate of dimensional change
in graphite increases with increasing temperature, so the thermal con-
ductivity and the allowable neutren fluence are related. Irradiation

is known to decrease the thermal conductivity but this effect is thought
to saturate at fluence values of about 1020 neutrons/cm?. Equipment

for making thermal conductivity measurements and irradiation capsules
for exposing samples have been proven satisfactory. About three grades
of graphite will be irradiated at 550, 650, and 750°C to fluences i
ranging from 1 X 101° to 3.5 x 1022 neutrons/cm?. The samples will be

removed periodically for thermal conductivity measurements. A goal of

this work will be to relate changes in thermal conductivity to some i
basic characteristic of the graphite such as the raw material used in

its manufacture.

9.7.6 Task 8.4.2 Thermal expansion

 

The coefficient of thermal expansion is an indicator of the crystallo- EE
graphic structure. The differences in thermal expansion in different

directions is a measure of the crystalline anisotropy. The magnitude

of the thermal expansion is closely related to the raw material used si
in making the graphite. A number of theories dealing with radiation
damage utilize the coefficient of thermal expansion to predict the

dimensional changes that will occur during irradiation. The coefficient
of thermal expansion is also a necessary parameter for design purposes.

Measuring equipment and irradiation techniques have been developed for
incrementally following the thermal expansion of graphite during irradi-
ation. Samples of three graphites will be measured, irradiated in HFIR,
and removed periodically in order to repeat the measurements. (The

same samples used in the above task will be used for these measurements.)

9.7.7 Task 8.4.3 Electrical conductivity

 

Electrical conductivity of graphite is a measure of the mobility of
electrons through the material and is a rather basic parameter. This
property is closely related to the thermal conductivity and the measuring
techniques for thermal conductivity are such that electrical conductivity
measurements can be obtained at the same time. Thus, the experimental
plan described in Task 8.4.1 would be applicable to determination of
electrical conductivity.

9.7.8 Task 8.4.4 Elastic properties

 

The elastic properties of graphite are used in numerous design calcula-
tions, the most important one being the magnitude of the stresses devel-
oped in the moderator elements due to differential dimensional changes
across the element. The elastic properties are affected by irradiation
and this variable will be included in the test program. Sonic methods
will likely be used to measure the elastic constants. A sound wave is
pulsed through a sample and the times for obtaining reflected waves in
the transverse and longitudinal directions are measured. These data
define the velocity of sound in the two directions, and these values

can be used to calculate Youngs and shear moduli. These two elastic
constants allow calculation of all other elastic constants. The small
cylindrical samples used in Task 8.2 and 8.3 would be used for these
measurements. A key part of the measuring technique is not yet worked
out which concerns the means of coupling a transducer to the sample for
transmitting and receiving the sound pulse. The method currently in use
would contaminate the sample and would prevent further irradiation of
the sample.

9.8 TASK GROUP 8.5 EVALUATION TESTS FOR MSBR GRAPHITE

Several tests must be made on the grade of graphite chosen for the
molten—-salt test reactor and for the reference design MSBR. The work
carried out in Task Groups 8.1 through 8.4 will have involved small
samples. Tests of a proof nature will be run on large pieces having

the full cross section of a moderator element. These tests will include
long-term irradiation tests on uncoated and coated elements, and sub-
sequent evaluation of the irradiated specimens.
9-36

9.8.1 Objective

The objective of this task will be to evaluate in detail the properties =
of large moderator elements.

9.8.2 Schedule

The schedule for work in this task group is shown in Table 9.8.2.

9.8.3 Funding

Operating fund requirements for this task group are shown in Table
9.8.3.1, and capital equipment fund requirements are shown in Table
9.8.3.2. This includes capital equipment funds in the amount of $300,000
in both FY 1980 and FY 1981 for construction of two facilities for in-
reactor irradiation of large moderator graphite sections.

9.8.4 Facilities

Facilities will be required for irradiation of large-scale prototypic i
moderator graphite elements, and two instrumented, in-reactor test facili-

ties capable of independent temperature control will be constructed.

Location of the facilities in the ORR, the HFIR, or a Savannah River

reactor appears possible.

9.8.5 Task 8.5.1 Large-scale irradiation testing i

The irradiation testing performed in other tasks has invelved small test

samples, however, some proof testing on large elements will be necessary. i
The main variable not evaluated by the small samples is fabrication in-
homogeneities. Density gradients, variations in pore size distribution
and other inhomogeneities can be present in large elements. Large
elements that have been sealed to prevent xenon permeation can have areas
in which the coating will vary in its dimensional stability during irra-
dation. These coating inhomogeneities could lead to earlier localized
coating failures than predicted from data for small specimens.

9.8.5.1 Subtask 8.5.1.1 Base graphite

 

Graphite samples having the full cross section of an MSBR moderator
element and about 2 ft long will be irradiated in the core of the ORR
and likely some other reactor having a larger irradiation facility (e.g.,
a Savannah River reactor). It is likely that the experiments will be
instrumented to obtain continuous data on dimensional changes. The
experiments will likely be removed periodically for dimensional measure- Bi
ments and replacement of in-reactor instrumentation. These experiments

will likely involve two to four elements of the reference graphite, will

be exposed over the temperature range of 500 to 750°C, and will be
irradiated to a fluence of about 3 x 1022 neutrons/cm? over a period of
several years.

9.8.5.2 Subtask 8.5.1.2 Coated elements

Samples of the reference graphite will be coated by the most promising
techniques and irradiated in the same type of experiment as described in
Subtask 8.5.1.1. The specimens will have the full cross section of a
moderator element and will be at least 1-ft long. They will alsc contain
a small center annulus with lines for collecting and analyzing the gas
from this annulus. The permeability will be determined in situ from the
knowledge of the geometry, the pressure differential, and the rate of
ingress of gas into the inner annulus. These experiments will run for
several years to fluences of 3.5 Xx 1022 neutrons/cm?.

Since the permeability measurements will be made in situ, the experiments
will be removed only after the permeability becomes too high for the
experiment to be of interest or when the instrumentation must be replaced.

9.8.6 Task 8.5.2 Analytical evaluation of reference graphite

The large-scale irradiation experiments in Task 8.5.1 will provide data
of unique value for analytically analyzing the performance of graphite
in a reactor. The ability of graphite to creep under irradiation is
required to relax stresses that develop due to anisotropic dimensional
changes. The elements in these experiments will experience anisotropic
dimensional changes and the demonstrated ability of the graphite to
accommodate these dimensional changes while remaining integral will be
of extreme value. The demonstrated lifetime of the coatings will allow
a realistic assessment of the economics of graphite replacement at a
given fluence versus continued operation at a lower performance. The
information obtained from these experiments will be analyzed with regard
to performance and made available for use in reactor design and analysis
(Section 8).

10. REACTOR TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT

10.1 INTRODUCTION

10.1.1 Objective

The objective of this activity is development of the technology necessary
for designing and specifying the performance of components and systems
which would constitute molten-salt reactors including a test reactor, a
demonstration reactor, and a 1000-MW(e) MSBR.

10.1.2 Scope

This activity covers all development work associated with reactor systems
and components except for that dealing with fuel processing and instrumen-
tation development, which are covered in Sections 3 and 12, respectively.
In general, determination of basic physical properties of salts and the
development of materials of construction fall outside this activity:
however, some information of this type will result from work in this
activity.

Although the requirements for components and systems will be specified
largely by conceptual design studies for the various molten-salt reactors
considered in the activity Reactor Design and Analysis (Section 8), addi-
tional conceptual design studies would be carried out as necessary for
identifying problem areas in proposed component designs and for properly
orienting the component technology development.

In general, work in this activity proceeds from small equipment, which
may involve tests with aqueous sclutions rather than molten-salt, through
successively larger equipment sizes and culminates in tests using molten
salt on a scale sufficiently large to allow detailed component design

for test ana demonstration reactors.

After operation of the moltem-salt test reactor (see Section 14) and test
reactor mockup (see Section 13), additional development work will be re-
guired to scale up equipment which functioned satisfactorily, to develop
items the need for which is not now known, and to make improvements re-
quired for a demonstration reactor. This work is covered in Section 15.

In all of the development activities, industrial participation through
government-sponscred subcontracts as well as industry-sponsored work
will be solicited and encouraged. All large components will be purchased
from logical vendors, if available, in order to establish a source for
future reactor components.

The work associated with this activity area is divided into the following
task groups:

10-1
10-2

Fuel Salt Technology Development (Task Group 9.1)

Coolant Salt Technology Development (Task Group 9.2)

Steam System Technology Development (Task Group 9.3)

Cover and Off-Gas Systems Technology Development (Task Group 9.4)
Salt Pump Development (Task Group 9.5)

Primary Salt-Salt Heat Exchanger Development (Task Group 9.6)
Valve Development (Task Group 9.7)

Control Rod Development (Task Group 9.8)

Containment and Cell Heating Development {Task Group 9.9)
Components Test Facility (Task Group 92.10)

10.1.3 Relation to other activity areas

 

There is a close relationship between all activity areas in this program
plan, and careful coordination of the work is necessary. In many cases
the need for reactor technology development may originate in other
activity areas and, conversely, the reactor development activities may
dictate additional work elsewhere, such as chemical research or safety
analysis. Much of the instrumentation and controls development (Section
12} as well as the maintenance procedures (Section 11) will be governed
by the results of reactor technology development work. Especially close
contact will be maintained with the activities on reactor design and
analysis and on reactor safety.

10.2 BUDGET AND SCHEDULE
10.2.1 Schedule

The work in the Molten-Salt Reactor Program in the near future will be

of a technology nature; and, during this period, work in the Reactor
Technology Development area will be concerned mainly with development

and testing in the Gas-System Technology Facility, which circulates fuel
salt and in the Coolant-Salt Technology Facility, which circulates cool-
ant salt. Work in these facilities will be phased out during the period
FY 1977 to 1981. Other small-scale development of components and systems

will begin in the period FY 1977 to 1979, using small separate facilities.

Larger—scale component development will be done in the Components Test
Facility which will be completed during FY 1982.

The steam generator and salt pump development activities appear to be
critical path items, and work on these components will be carried out

as rapidly as funds allow. Some steam generator studies will be done
during FY 1975, with the work effort increasing rapidly in order to
effect the timely development of technology required for design of a
molten-salt test reactor. Salt pump procurement activities will begin

in FY 1878, which should allow testing of an MSTR prototype pump to begin
in FY 1983.

The schedule for work on reactor technology development is shown in
Table 10.2.1.

10.3 EXPERIENCE AND STATUS OF DEVELOPMENT

10.3.1 Fuel salt technology development

 

The MSRE was operated from 1964 to 1969 using a fuel salt similar to that
proposed for the MSBR. When it was shut down in December of 1969, the
reactor had accumulated 13,172 full-power hours of operation and salt had
been circulated in the fuel system for 21,788 hours. !

Although the MSRE was operated successfully using a fuel salt containing
2357 and later 233y, there are some significant differences relative to
the MSBR fuel salt which require additional study. The MSRE salt con-
tained about 5 mole % ZrF, for preventing U0; precipitation, whereas the
MSBR salt does not contain ZrFy. The proposed operating temperature and
power density of the MSBR are higher and the method for removing gaseous
fission products is somewhat more complicated. These differences, to-
gether with other uncertainties, dictate a number of developmental tasks
associated with the fuel salt system.

In a reactor which operates in the thermal energy range, continuous re-
moval of the gaseous fission product, xenon-135, is necessary to obtain
a breeding ratio greater than 1.0. In a molten-salt breeder reactor
(MSBR) , the xenon-135 circulates in solution with the molten fluoride
fuel salt, and the proposed xenon removal method consists of circulating
a low volume fraction (0.2 to 1% at core midplane) of helium bubbles
with the salt to serve as a sparging agent. The xenon-135 and other
gaseous fission products would transfer from the salt to the helium
bubbles by turbulent diffusion and would be stripped from the salt-
bubble mixture when the bubbles are removed. Calculations, based on
currently available information, have shown that stripping the bubbles
from a 10% side stream would reduce the xenon poisoning to an acceptable
level and that little advantage would be gained by stripping larger
streams. Supplementary iodine stripping would be needed only if
satisfactory methods cannot be developed for sealing the core graphite
with respect to xenon permeation. Work on xenon stripping has been
concentrated on the development and aqueous testing of in-line bubble
generators? and bubble separators.3 Based on tests of various bubble
generator types under different operating conditions and using different
aqueous solutions, a venturi-type generator was selected for further
testing in salt. The bubble size produced by the bubble generator is
believed to have a minor influence on the overall operation of a xenon
removal system because of bubble degradation and compression during
passage of the bubbles through the primary pump and other changes in
bubble size that may occur because of coalescence, gas solubility, and
pressure changes.

Tests of bubble separators have been conducted using demineralized water
and two modeling fluids, a 41% glycerin-water mixture and a 31% aqueous
calcium chloride sclution, both having kinematic viscosities equivalent

to MSBR fuel salt at 1225°F. These tests would be conservative in regard
to bubble separation efficiency at higher salt temperatures. The bubble
diameters at the bubble separator inlet using the test fluids were about
0.001 to 0.005 in. as compared with about 0.020 in. in demineralized water.
Since the bubble size characteristics in a molten-salt system were unknown
at the time, development tests were continued with the small bubbles
associated with the CaCl, solution rather than searching for a suitable
fluid having bubble sizes more nearly equivalent to those observed with
water. Based on these tests, an axial-flow, centrifugal-type bubble
separator was designed for testing in the Gas-Systems Technology Facility.
CaCl, solution tests on this design showed bubble separation efficiencies
of greater than 807% under normal operating conditions. Based on a bench-
scale comparison test of bubble formation and ccalescence, a higher sepa-
ration efficiency is expected with molten salt. Bubble size determination
would aid in further separator evaluation; however, instrumentation of
this type does not appear to be available.

Very little quantitative information is available regarding the distri-
bution of tritium in MSR systems. The amount of tritium that could
reach the steam system of the reference design MSBR is estimated to be
about one-third of the 2420 Ci/day production rate in the fuel." Tests
made shortly before the MSRE was shut down indicate that about half of
10-10

the tritium was discharged from the fuel off-system.® Less than 10%

diffused through the metal walls of the fuel system to the containment-

cell atmosphere, and less than 10% reached the air through the heat re- i.
moval system. More quantitative information regarding tritium behavior
in large molten-salt systems is needed.

The fission process is mildly oxidizing toward dissolved u3* in the fuel. =
At the MSRE, beryllium metal was dissolved in the fuel salt periodically

in order to adjust the redox potential of the salt, and some changes in

the physical properties of the fuel salt were noted at these times. ws
Since such changes could affect the efficiency of the bubble generator,
further studies of the variation of physical properties of the salt with
redox potential and their significance with respect to xenon removal are
needed,

Fissile material inventory and system corrosion rates will be indicated
by analysis of the fuel salt. On-line analytical devices will be de-
veloped for this application as outlined in Section 6. In addition, it
will be necessary to perform selected chemical analyses in a hot cell
laboratory. Obtaining a sample and delivering it to the laboratory wi
requires careful manipulation to prevent altering the salt chemistry.

In addition, adequate containment must be maintained. The experience

with the MSRE sampler,’ which functioned well during the entire period a
of operation, will be utilized in developing samplers for future molten
salt reactors.

The after-heat removal system for the MSBR utilizes the fuel drain tank
and a natural-circulation NaK cooling system. Heat is transferred from
the salt through an air gap to tubes through which NaK circulates. The
MSRE drain tanks were equipped with similar cooling tubes having an air
gap; however, boiling water was used as the cooling medium. The pre-
dicted heat transfer rates for this system were verified’ but no infor-
mation was obtained on system service life.

10.3.2 Coolant salt technology development

 

Molten—-salt breeder reactor systems require the circulation of an inter-
mediate coolant to (1) provide a barrier for protecting the steam system
from fission product contamination and for protecting the fuel system
from steam—system pressures, (2) transfer the nuclear heat from the fuel
salt to the water-steam system, and (3) bridge the temperature interval
between the fuel salt liquidus temperature and the steam system feed
water temperature.

A mixture of LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole 7) was used successfully as the coolant

in the secondary system of the MSRE, but its high liquidus temperature te
(875°F) and high cost ($600 to $1400/ft3) prompted a search for other

possible coolants.2’ Of the alternates considered, the sodium fluoro-

borate eutectic, NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole 7%), appears to be the most promis- EE
ing. It has a relatively low melting point (725°F) and cost ($60/ft3),
pd

and there is a possibility that it can aid in preventing transport of
tritium to the steam system by interaction with the tritium. Among its
disadvantages are (1) the need for BF; in the cover gas because of the
evolution of BF; from NaBF, at MSBR operating temperatures, and (2) the
corrosiveness of fluoroborate in the presence of water.

10.3.2.1 Experience

Sodium fluorchborate eutectic salt has been circulated for tens of thousands
of hours in natural- and forced-convection loops constructed of Hastelloy N
to obtain data on corrosion, mass transfer, and materials compatibility.

In addition, an MSRE-scale pump loop (PKP-1) constructed of 4-in.-diam
Inconel pipe was operated with a flow rate of 750 gpm at 800 to 1000°F
for over 11,000 hr to obtain experience with both the salt and the BFj3-
helium cover gas system required for salt composition control.?® Because
the configuration of the PKP-1 loop was not suitable for conducting the
additional required experiments and the material of construction was
atypical of current and proposed molten~salt reactors, an all Hastelloy N
loop was designed and constructed using the pump and piping salvaged from
the secondary coclant system of the MSRE. This loop, known as the Coolant-
Salt Technology Facility (CSTF), was undergoing shakedown tests when the
MSR Program was interrupted in 1972.

Evidence of the corrosion product, NajCrFg;, has been found in virtually
all loops circulating sodium fluoroborate. The corrosion preduct is found
in the coldest part of the circuit and is expected to deposit on tubes in
the steam-raising equipment. For this reason, the solubility of Na3CrFg
in sodium fluoroborate was determined and cold trapping techniques were
tested with limited success for isolating this material in natural- and
forced-circulation loops. Excessive drain times have sometimes been en-
countered which were attributed to the accumulation of Naj3CRFg in drain
lines.

10.3.2.2 Status of fluoroborate coolant technolegy

The compatibility of sodium fluoroborate with the proposed MSBR con-
tainer material (Hastelloy N)} is satisfactory (corrosion rate of 0.1 toc
0.2 mil per year) provided that moisture is excluded from the system. 2?

Heat transfer data obtained with the forced-convection loop FCL-2 are in
good agreement with the empirical correlation of Sieder and Tate. These
data indicate that sodium fluoroborate performs as a typical heat trans-
fer fluid.30

Experience with operation of the PKP-1 loop?® indicates that the salt
composition can be monitored by relating the thermal conductivity of

the off-gas to the total system pressure and salt temperature, and the
salt composition can be controlled by maintaining a suitable BF3 partial
pressure in the gas above the salt in the pump.
16-12

Fluoroborate salt mist is a potential problem with the large pumps con-

templated in future molten-salt reactors. Although sodium fluoroborate

undergoes a solid-phase transition at V470°F, no unusual problems asso-

ciated with this phenomenon were encountered with operation of the freeze i
valves used in the forced-convection and PKP loops.

New or additional work is needed in the following areas: we

1. Use of hvdrogenous species in the coolant salt to control
tritium migration (see Task 4.3.4 of Section 5}.
2. Effect of corrosion product (Na3CrFg) deposits on steam generator
performance and effectiveness of cold traps for ameliorating this
problem. i

3. Effect of solid-phase density change on system piping and com-
ponents (see Section 10.6). a

4. Feasibility of a BF3 recovery and recycle system (see Section
10.7.6)

5. Management of secondary circuit off-gas line restrictions (see
Section 10.7.6}.

6. Variation of BF3 partial pressure during gross mixing of fuel and
coolant salts.

10.3.3 Steam—-system technology development

The salt-to-steam interface in an MSR system will consist of steam gener-
ators and steam reheaters. The steam reheater is regarded as a conven-
tional heat exchanger with ne fundamental problems of heat transfer or
development foreseen. Even though the 650°F reheat steam enters the
reheater below the 725°F liquidus temperature of the coolant salt, the
low steam—side heat-transfer coefficient leads to the conclusion that
there will be no significant problem with freezing of the salt. —

 

The steam generator tubes will contain supercritical steam and, in the
reference design, will be in contact with sodium fluorcborate. The peak
temperature on the steam side will be about 1000°F and that on the salt
side will be 1150°F. Both of these fluids are corrosive under certain
conditions. Sodium fluorocborate is aggressive if the salt has been in
contact with water, and steam is oxidizing to metals and can produce i
stress corrosion cracking when it contains small concentrations of chlo-

rides. Thus, the material used for steam generator tubes in a molten-

salt system must resist corrosion by both sodium fluorcborate and steam, i
or duplex tubes must be used.

 

With the use of thermal baffles for the protection of the tube sheet,
the 700°F feedwater entering the generator will cool some of the static
salt below its 725°F liquidus temperature and the salt will freeze on
 

 

SEE

 

10-13

the colder surfaces. The steam generator design must accommodate the
freezing and thawing of this small amount of salt without structural
damage to the steam generator.

It is likely that direct maintenance of the steam generator will be
possible even though there will be some induced sodium activity in the
sodium fluoroborate. Estimates place the 2bNa activity at a sufficiently
low value (about 11 pu curies per gram of salt) to allow for direct mainte-
nance if the steam generator is drained of salt. Although the extent of
the problem is uncertain at this time, it is possible that the maintenance
plan will have to accommodate two other sources of radioactive contamina-
tion. Trace elements in Hastelloy N (such as cobalt) will be activated
and could be subsequently dispersed throughout the coolant circuit by

the corrosion process. Failure of a primary heat exchanger tube could
allow fission products to enter the coolant and be dispersed throughout
the secondary circuit. The design of the steam generator must accommo-
date the necessary maintenance and inspection to meet the requirements

for in-service inspection, for minimizing down time, and for detection,
location, and plugging of leaking or damaged steam tubes (see Section 11
for a discussion of maintenance technology development}.

The steam-power system proposed for the MSBR reference design consists
of supercritical cycle and equipment that is conventional except for
the feedwater and reheat steam preheating facilities. The cycle used
in the Bull Run steam station of the TVA was adapted for use with the
MSBR in order to make the plant cost and performance estimates more
realistic. The MSBR steam cycle uses steam at turbine throttle condi-
tions of 3500 psia and 1000°F. Steam generator outlet steam attempera-
tion is provided for control of turbine inlet conditions at part-load
operation.

One of the two unconventional features in ORNL's adaptation of the TVA
steam cycle is the two-stage reheat of extraction steam by use of a
prime-steam-heated preheater and a salt-~heated reheater. The other
unconventional feature is the heating of feedwater to 700°F by direct
mixing of the 866°F steam exiting the above preheater with the high
pressure 550°F feedwater leaving the top extraction heater. Two large
motor-driven, canned-rotor centrifugal pumps in parallel are used to
boost about 19,000 gpm of feedwater from about 3500 psia to 3800 psia.
Eight steps of feedwater heating are used in addition to the direct mix~
ing step to obtain the 700°F feedwater temperature. The use of the super-
critical cycle allows direct mixing without serious problems.

Based on the present conservative assumption that a 700°F feedwater tem-
perature is necessary, a supercritical steam system is the only reason-
able choice. Heating the feedwater to 700°F in a subcritical pressure
cycle would require a very large amount of heat transfer surface or,
more likely, use of the Loeffler cycle. The steam generator would be-
come a superheater requiring a steam compressor and a much larger mass
fiow rate.
10-14

If use of feedwater at 580°F is determined to be feasible, the mixing
chamber, pressure booster pumps, and reheat steam preheaters could be
eliminated from the supercritical cycle, The increase in efficiency
plus the simplification of the steam system would represent a substan-
tial savings. Alternatively, a subcritical pressure steam cycle becomes
feasible and can be included in the options for a MSBR power system.

The feasibility of using lower feedwater temperature should be investi-
gated for both subcritical and supercritical pressure steam cycles.

10.3.3.1 Experience

Since many of the problems of molten-salt and liquid-metal systems are
similar, the experience being gained in the LMFBR program will be helpful
in providing information which is either directly applicable or at least
sufficiently similar to provide guidance in planning the development pro-
gram. A few examples of IMFBR development areas in which problems are
similar are as follows:

1. Work done in the development of high-temperature design criteria
and thermal stress analysis of complex geometries will be appli-
cable although the materials are not the same.

2. The problems of stability and flow reversal at low load on the tube
and shell sides respectively are similar to those of a molten-salt
generator,

3. The problems of overpressure protection and pressure pulse analysis
of the secondary system are similar and portions of the ILMFBR ex-
perience will be helpful in planning the molten-salt tests.

4. The LMFBR experience in the development of techniques for the fabri-
cation of thick tube sheets and joining of tubes to tube sheets will
be of benefit to the molten-salt program.

The coolant salt composition used in the MSRE is not the same as that
proposed for the MSBR. However, preliminary heat transfer information
obtained during operation of a small corrosion loop with sodium flucro-
borate indicates general agreement with the Sieder-Tate correlation, and
indicates that the use of accurate physical property data with correla~-
tions used for normal fluids is adequate for heat transfer design in
fluoride salt systems. Correlations for heat transfer and pressure drop
were chosen from the open literature and adapted for use in designing the
MSBR reference primary heat exchanger and steam generator.

Although the operating experience with salts is quite extensive, there
has been no experience in the generation of steam in high-temperature,
molten—salt-heated steam generators. There is a considerable amount of
experience, both in the USA and Europe, with a low-melting salt (Hitec)

for the generation of low-pressure steam and as a heat transfer medium.®

The compatibility of Hastelloy N with steam has been investigated in a
test facility in the TVA Bull Run Steam Plant. Unstressed specimens that
were exposed to steam at 1000°F had very acceptable metal loss rates
(<0.25 mil/year). Work has been conducted to evaluate the possibilities
of stress corrosion of Hastelloy N in the presence of steam as reported
by Spalaris et al.® based on their rather limited work.

Some tests have been performed on duplex tubing manufactured by the
International Nickel Company which consisted of Incoloy 800 on the steam

i side (inside) and nickel on the salt side. In this arrangement, these
materials have excellent compatibility with salt and steam.

10.3.3.2 Status of technology

As previously mentioned, the unconventional feedwater heating require-
i ments of the MSBR reference steam cycle require the use of booster pumps
and mixing chambers. Although both of these components are currently in
use at conditions near those required, the sizes needed for a 1000-MW(e)
ss MSBR are not presently available. While carrying out work under an ORNL
subcontract, Ebasco Services, Inc., found that the canned-rotor booster
pumps needed for the MSBR steam cycle are about 507 larger than the
largest known pump built to date.l? Consequently, development of larger
capacity, multistage pumps would be needed. The mixing chambers needed
are also larger than those in use, but this does not appear to impose a
major development problem since a chamber similar to one specified for
a the MSBR system and about four-fifths as large is in use at the TVA Bull
Run Steam Plant.

a As an alternative, a high-pressure heat exchanger could be used to ob-
tain the 700°F feedwater. The exit heating steam could be then heated
to 1000°F in a salt-heated exchanger and reintroduced into the cycle,

. thereby eliminating the pressure booster pumps.

Working under ORNL subcontract, Ebasco Services, Inc., examined alterna-
tive steam systems but selected essentially the same steam system as the

Ha ORNL reference system.l! They concluded that the use of direct mixing
for feedwater heating and the special booster pumps is feasible and
within foreseeable technological development. With the background of

i MSRE experience and the subsequent development operation, there is con-

fidence in predicting salt-side heat transfer coefficients if accurate

physical property data are available. More testing and operating expe-
rience is needed with the reference-design salt compositions to verify
present information concerning physical properties, heat transfer and
pressure drop, and the avoidance of flow instability and stratification
problems.

 

The corrosion experience with Hastelloy N in steam is mostly favorable;

however, several questions must be resolved before a firm conclusion can
i be reached. The duplex tubing of nickel-Incoloy 800 looks promising:

the compatibility is excellent, and production methods for the tubing
10-16

have been developed so that a high quality product can be obtained at a
lower cost than Hastelloy N tubing. On the other hand, steam generator
fabrication would be complicated by use of duplex tubing.

A considerable amount of information is available on the use of super-
critical steam: over 140 supercritical pressure steam generation units
are now operating, under construction, or on order in the United States,
Europe, and Japan. Design of molten-salt steam generators can draw on
this experience,

Some work has been done with computer simulations of the control of the
MSBR system, as discussed in Section 12. The results indicated that in
order to maintain both the primary salt and the coolant salt cold leg
temperatures above their respective liquidus temperatures, either of two
control schemes would be satisfactory; both require a variable coolant
salt flow. One control scheme would require attemperation of outlet
steam before it reaches the turbine and the second would require a con-
trolled bypass flow of coolant salt around the primary heat exchanger.
The attemperation of outlet steam between the steam generator and the
turbine introduces some uncertainty in turbine protection, while the
controlled bypass flow would require the development of a salt throttling
valve. The problems of attemperation will be explored as part of the
steam generator industrial program. The salt valve requirements are
discussed later (Sectiom 10.3.7). Some work has been done at ORNL with

a hybrid computer to identify and define various control and emergency
transients which will be imposed on heat exchangers 2 so that the de-
signer can effectively deal with them by either control system design

or structural design.

A steam generator development report has been prepared! which presents
the basis for the development of melten-salt-heated steam generators and
associated auxiliaries such as a startup system and a secondary salt
pressure-relief system. This report reviews the LMFBR program experi-
ence in areas which appear applicable to molten-salt steam generators.
Also, a conceptual design description has been prepared for a 3-MW

Steam Generator Tube Test Stand (STIS) for the preliminary development
testing of multitube assemblies.

Conceptual designs of molten-salt primary heat exchangers and steam
generators have been or are being prepared by ORNL, Ebasco Services,
Inc., Foster Wheeler Corporation, and by Black and Veatch. The con-
ceptual design being considered for the reference MSBR system by Foster
Wheeler under an ORNL subcontract consists of an "L" configuration sized
at 483 MW for a single-unit-per-cooclant-lcop design. The unit would con-
tain 1032 tubes (3/4 in. OD, 0.125 in. wall), and would be about 116 ft
tall. Long flow (instead of cross flow) is being considered on the shell
side to avoid the high pressure drop which results from attempting to
meet conflicting requirements cof vibration and baffle spacing.

One steam generator configuration which will receive attention in future
design studies and has promise of alleviating the feedwater temperature

 

 
 

 

 

16-17

requirement uses the bayonet or re-entrant tube concept. Although in-
vestigations thus far indicate that the bayonet tube configuration is
not practical at supercritical pressures because of the thick tube wall
required, it has definite possibilities for a subcritical pressure
system.

10.3.4 Cover and off-gas svstem technology development

The cover and off-gas systems for a molten-salt reactor must (1) protect
the fuel and coolant salts from oxidizing atmospheres, and (2) provide
positive containment of the radioactive noble gases and daughters and
any other radioactive material which might be transferred from the fuel
system.

In the fuel off-gas system for the reference design MSBR,3! fission
product gases, together with helium carrier gas and entrained salt, are
stripped from the fuel system by means of a gas separator and venturi.
The gas passes first through the fuel-salt drain tank (and, if necessary,
a particle trap) where entrained salt and non-volatile fission products
are removed, and then through a 47-hr charcoal-bed holdup system where
97% of the Xe-135 is permitted to decay. The gas is then split into two
streams, one of which (80%) is returned to the fuel system via the bubble
generator. The other stream (20%) is passed through a long-delay charcoal-
bed holdup system where all radioactive gases except Kr-85 are allowed to
decay to insignificant levels, and through a cleanup system for removal
of gaseous fission products and other contaminants. This stream is then
recycled to the primary system for re-use as purge gas. No radicactive
fission products are discharged to the atmosphere.

10.3.4.1 Experience

Charcoal-bed holdup systems were used to treat the fuel system off-gas
streams from the Homogeneous Reactor Test (HRT) and the Molten~Salt
Reactor Experiment (MSRE). Also, charcoal beds are currently being used
to treat gas streams in solid-fuel reactors and processing systems. The
MSRE off-gas systems generally operated satisfactorily except for occa-
sional plugging of the off-gas lines due partly to organic material and
partly to entrained salt and non-volatile fission products. The MSRE
cover gas supply system used a titanium-sponge reactor and a moclecular-
sieve column for removal of trace quantities of water and oxygen from
the gas.

10.3.4.2 Status of cover and off-gas system technology

 

Dynamic adsorption coefficients have been measured for Kr and Xe on
charcoal in the temperature range 25 to 100°C. 32
10-18

Computer programs have been developed and used for the calculation of
charcoal bed temperature profiles, pipe sizes, and charcoal quantities
for both the HRT and the MSRE. However, the programs do not provide an
optimum design, and a certain amount of iteration and interpretation is
necessary.

The use of side-stream iodine strippers has been suggested as a method
for minimizing the Xe-135 poison fraction in the MSBR. This concept

was not included in the reference design, but conceptual design studies
were carried out in sufficient detzil to indicate that the gas flow would
be about 2.3 m3/sec (4800 cfm) and that the gas should contain 1% HF to
change the redox potential of the salt. If a decision were made to use
iodine strippers, a different approach to the design of the off-gas sys-
tem would be required since the high gas flow would make the charcoal-
bed holdup system impractical.

New or additional work is needed in the following areas:

1. The dynamic adsorption coefficients for Kr and Xe om charcoal
need to be experimentally determined for the temperature range
100°C to the highest anticipated operating temperature, currently
250°C. Other charcoal-related questions which need investigation
are thermal stability, nature and quantity of charcecal outgassing
at elevated temperatures, and effect of solids loading on the
adsorption coefficient.

2. Particle traps may be needed to prevent plugging of pipe lines in
both the fuel and coolant salt off-gas systems. Additional work
is needed to enable prediction of the character and quantity of
entrained solids and establishment of criteria for the design of
particle traps.

10.3.5 Salt pump development

 

The pumps for molten-salt breeder reactors must circulate fluoride salts
in primary (fuel) and secondary (coolant) salt systems reliably at tem-
peratures as high as 1300°F. Electromagnetic and centrifugal pumps have
been considered for this application. The low electrical conductivity of
molten fluoride salts hinders the application of electromagnetic pumps,
and, consequently, they are not used in fluoride salt systems. In con-
trast, centrifugal pumps have been applied very satisfactorily. A studyl®
of the problems of applying the canned-rotor motor and the short-shaft
and long-shaft configurations of the centrifugal pump to molten-salt
service was made in 1967. The canned-rotor pump was concluded to be a
very desirable configuration, since there zre no orientation or eleva-
tion limitations on its application. However, it would require difficult
and expensive development to provide pumps for an MSBR application, in-
cluding the development of a high-temperature electric motor having
electrical insulation that has a very high resistance to nuclear radia-
tion damage. Thus efforts have been centered on sump pumps, and all
pumps built or proposed for MSBR's are centrifugal sump pumps.
we

10-19

This pump can be considered to have two basic configurations that are
differentiated by shaft length and type of shaft support bearings. The
short-shaft pump has a rotary element which contains conventional, oil-
lubricated bearings that support the shaft from which the impeller is
overhung. In the long-shaft pump the lower end of the shaft is supported
by a molten-salt-lubricated bearing. This type of pump might be prefer-
able for reactor salt systems that require locating the impeller at
relatively low elevations in the system layout.

All salt pumps built for test facility and reactor operation at ORNL have
been of the short-shaft configuration, and this pump type is proposed for
the primary salt system in the reference design for a single fluid MSBR.16
Except for its larger capacity, this pump is very similar to those used

in 1954 in the ARE, those proposed for the Aircraft Reactor Test (ART)

in the late 1950's,t7 and those operated for over 20,000 hours in the
MSRE in the 1960's. Efforts were made to elicit industrial interest in
the production of salt pumps for the ARE, ART, MSRE, and associated
molten—-salt test facilities. However, the number of pumps to be produced
at any one time was apparently too small to obtain serious industrial
interest. In 1969, a specification'® was written for a short-shaft cen-
trifugal pump to provide the requirements of the primary and secondary
salt systems in a 100- to 200-MW(t) MSBE. Westinghouse Electro Mechanical
Division responded favorably to the request, but due to the deemphasis of
the MSBR in 1970 their proposal was dropped.

Although the long-shaft centrifugal pump having salt-lubricated bearings
has been proposed as an alternate to the short-shaft pump, experience
with molten—salt-lubricated bearings is very limited. Test bearings

were operated at ORNL in 1960, and a PKP model pump was modified in

1962 and operated for approximately 12,500 hr at 1225°F with the lower
end of the shaft supported with a molten-salt-lubricated bearing. Be-
cause large-scale pumps of this configuration were outside known experi-
ence, ORNL had the rotor dynamics of the shaft-bearing-housing system and
the characteristics of molten=-salt-lubricated bearings examined in some
detail by Mechanical Technology Inc.l?® This study defined many of the
remaining problems and produced recommendations for a development program.

10.3.6 Primary salt—salt heat exchanger development

 

The operation of the MSRE represents the most-recent large-scale experi-
ence with salt-to-salt heat exchangers.2® This operation provided a
considerable amount of confidence in the design techniques and in pre-
dicted performance information.

The heat transfer correlations used for the MSRE primary heat exchanger
were based on the previous development tests which showed that fluoride
salts behave as normal fluids. When the MSRE operation revealed thé
overall heat transfer coefficient to be less than predicted, a reevalu-
ation of the physical properties disclosed that the actual thermal con-
ductivities of the fuel and coolant salts were below those used in the
design calculations and accounted for the difference.?! The overall heat
10-20

transfer coefficient of the MSRE heat exchanger did not change during
some 22,000 hr of salt circulation and 13,000 equivalent full-power hours
of operation, thus indicating no buildup of scale and no evidence of gas
filming.

The fuel- and coolant-salt compositions used in the MSRE are not the same
as those proposed for the MSBR. However, some preliminary heat transfer
information from the operation of a small corrosion loop with sodium
fluoroborate indicates general agreement with the Sieder-Tate correla-
tion.22 Thus, the use of accurate physical property data with correla-
tions for normal fluids is adequate for heat transfer design with fluoride
salts. There is, however, nc molten-salt heat transfer experience with
the knurled tubes proposed for the primary heat exchanger in the ORNL
reference design, nor is information available on the effects of sodium
fluoroborate corrosion product deposition on the tubes.

The overall conditions in the MSBR system impose several specific design
requirements on the primary heat exchangers:

1. The volume of fuel salt in the heat exchanger must be kept as low
as practical to minimize the fuel doubling time for the reactor.

2. The entrance and exit salt temperatures, pressure drops, and the
total heat transfer capacity must conform with the overall system
operating conditions.

3. The type of heat exchanger, general location of nozzles, height of
the unit, and minimum tube diameter must be compatible with various
design, layout, and fabrication considerations.

4. The heat exchanger must be arranged for relatively easy tube-bundle
replacement by means of remotely operated tooling.

5. All portions of the exchangers in contact with the fuel or coolant
salt must have adequate corrosion resistance. As in any heat ex-
changer, the physical properties of the material establish maximum
allowable temperature gradients across walls, allowable stresses,
and the degree of flexibility required to accommodate differential
expansions.

6. Flow velocities, baffle thickness, tube clearance, and baffle
spacing should be selected to minimize possibilities of vibration.

Within the framework of the above requirements and guidelines, design

procedures?’ and a computer program?® were developed to produce an effi-
cient heat exchanger design having a low fuel-salt volume.

10.3.7 Valve development

Valves will be required in molten-salt reactors for isolating portions
of the reactor while the remainder operates, directing flow to alternate

 

 
 

 

 

16-21

paths, and providing flow variations for meeting start-up and off-design
conditions. For the MSBR, shut off valves will be required in sizes up
to 6 inches and throttling valves in sizes up to 24 inches.

Freeze valves operated successfully in the MSRE and in many out-of-pile
tests at ORNL in sizes up to 1-1/2-in. IPS pipe. More than 125 valves
of this type have been used, and more than 650,000 hr of operating time
has been accumulated. Freeze valves have been operated with salts as
diverse as the eutectic mixture of NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole 7), which has a
725°F melting point, and LiF, which has a 1560°F melting point.

Five 4-in. throttling valves were designed and fabricated at ORNL around
1955 for flow control in five pump loops that operated with molten salts
and liquid metals. The valves were designed for throttling service only
and were fabricated of Inconel. They were operated for a total time of
114,000 hr at temperatures ranging from 1000 to 1500°F, and no bellows
failure or significant mechanical problems occurred during that time.
Tests of bellows-sealed mechanical valves were conducted around 1957

in the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Program in an attempt to develop a
1-1/2~in. shut-off valve for molten salt at temperatures of 1200 to
1500°F. The valve seat material was considered to be the major problem,
and although a successful valve was not developed prior to cancellation
of the work, promising seat and plug material combinations were investi-
gated. Bellows-sealed valves up to a few inches in size have been used
successfully in many sodium applications. Most sodium valves of larger
size, however, have had sodium freeze seals on the valve stems, and this
option is not available for molten-salt valves. However, the valve de-
sign, fabrication, and operation presently planned in the LMFBR program
should provide much useful information to aid molten-salt valve develop-
ment.

10.3.8 Control rod development

 

The design of the MSBR takes advantage of the ease of adding fuel while
the reactor is operating to minimize the excess reactivity in the core,
and the ability to drain the fuel to effect complete reactor shutdown.
However, control rods which have both regulating and shimming functions
and safety rods used primarily for reactor shutdown are included in the
reference design. The control rods are graphite cylinders operating
directly in the salt. The safety rods are boron carbide (clad in
Hastelloy N) and also operate directly in the salt.

The control and safety rods of the ARE and MSRE were operated in metal
thimbles that separated them from the salt and therefore required aux-
iliary gas cooling. Because the rods and drives were separated from

the salt there was no problem of gas seals for fission product control.

The poison material for the ARE safety rod was B4C, and stainless steel
served as poison for the control rod.25 The poison element for the MSRE
control rod?® was a mixture of gadolinium and zluminum oxides, formed
10-22

and sintered into a number of short cylindrical tubes which were in turn
canned in Inconel. Visual observation of some of the canned elements

at the end of the reactor operation revealed no significant changes in
dimensions or external appearance.

There has been nc experience with control rods operated directly in the

salt; however, the physical arrangement and provisions for cooling might wt
be similar to that in the liquid-metal-cooled reactors. In one proposal

for a control rod for use with a liquid-metal-cooled reactor, the poison

section is guided within a duct which is positioned within the core. The i
MSBR reference design uses graphite ducts for guiding the safety rods

and the graphite control rods.

The materials proposed for the poison elements for the MSBR are similar
to those used in the ARE. There is wide experience with forming rare-
earth oxides and B,C into usable shapes and canning the elements to
protect them from the environment. Experience is lacking with such Ee
elements in a high neutron flux field; however, work is in progress

within the LMFBR Program.

10.3.9 Containment and cell heating development

 

The molten~salt reactor plant differs from other reactor plants in that
large amounts of fission products are dispersed throughout the reactor

primary system and several auxiliary systems. To alleviate the possi-

bility of escape of radioactivity, double containment is provided for és
equipment that contains the bulk of the radioactive liquids and gases.

For secondary containment, the general design for an MSBR can follow the

design that has come to be rather standard for nuclear reactors, and no i"
unusual construction techniques seem to be invglved in building the

cylindrical shell. Since much of the equipment and piping contain fuel

salt, heating must be supplied to preheat and maintain it at 1000°F or

higher. The MSBR primary system design calls for using the reactor

and fuel drain tank cells as ovens for preheating the equipment and

piping. The HIGR primary containment concept is very similar to this,

with comparable temperatures and much higher design pressures, and i
experience gained with supporting heavy equipment in this environment
and with cell wall cooling should provide much useful information and
guidance.

10.4 TASK GROUP 9.1 FUEL SALT TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT

16.4.1 Objective

The objective of this task group is to develop the technology associated ed
with the fuel salt system that is necessary for design of the primary

circuit of a molten—-salt test reactor and for confident scale up to a

molten—-salt demonstration reactor.
i

10-23

10.4.2 Schedule

As indicated in Table 10.4.2, construction of the Gas-Systems Technology
Facility will be completed for water operation in FY 1975, and the water
tests will be carried out. In FY 1976, modification of the GSTF for salt
operation will be completed, facility shakedown will be done, and test
operation will be started. The primary emphasis will be on evaluating
the performance of the bubble generator-bubble separator. In FY 1977,
testing of the bubble generator-bubble separator will continue but the
emphasis will switch te other tests such as tritium transport studies,
salt chemistry studies, and mass transfer measurements.

The work in FY 1976 and 1977 will be directed toward obtaining general
information in all problem areas related to fuel salt system technology
rather than refining the data in one specific area. With this approach,
there should be no overall uncertainties concerning the fuel salt system,
and refinement of data can be delayed until about FY 1980.

The remainder of the development work in the Gas-Systems Technology
Facility should be completed during FY 1981, as well as studies for
evaluation of xenon removal. The remainder of the known development
work in this task group can be finished by FY 1984.

10.4.3 Funding

The operating fund requirements for this task group are summarized in
Table 10.4.3.1. Capital equipment funds for this task group are shown
in Table 10.4.3.2.

10.4.4 Facilities

Most of the early work associated with this task group will be done in
the Gas-Systems Technology Facility (GSTF), a facility for circulating
molten salt at approximately 1000 gpm over the temperature range of 566
to 704°C (1050 to 1300°F). The salt to be used during most of the system
operation will be of the same composition as the fuel salt proposed for
an MSBR.

Figure 10.4.4 is a simplified diagram of the main systems of the facility.
The salt circulating system consists of a modified MSRE MARK II pump and
two parallel pipe loops. The main loop contains a flow measuring venturi,
a bubble separator, a flow restrictor, and a bubble generator. The
supply and discharge from the salt pump contain supply and return con-—
nections for future auxiliary loops. The loop piping and the bulk-salt
separator are fabricated from 5-in. Hastelloy N pipe. Metallurgical
surveillance specimens are installed in the main loop to allow periodic’
checks on the extent of corrosion of the system.

A small stream of salt is diverted to a salt-monitoring vessel which has
provisions for inserting probes for on-line monitoring of the chemical
composition of the salt. Samples of the salt can be removed from the
salt-monitoring vessel, the salt pump, or the drain tank. The drain
tank is separated from the loop by a freeze valve in the connecting salt
line.

411 salt-containing components are heated with electrical heaters which
are capable of holding the component temperatures as high as 704°C (1300°F).

Helium is supplied to the loop by the cover-gas system which contains
dryers and oxygen-removal units. The largest flow of gas is te the bubble
generator with smaller flows to the salt pump shaft and to the bubbler-
type level elements. The combined off-gas stream flows through a holdup
volume and a pressure-throttling valve to simulate the MSBR off-gas
system.

In normal operation the gas space in the salt pump operates at a pressure
of 15 psig. The pump has a rated flow of 1000 gpm at a discharge pressure
of 156 psig. The salt flow through the main loop is 500 gpm. Gas can be
injected into the bubble generator at flow rates as high as 37 std. liters/
min and is removed at the bubble separator along with an accompanying salt
flow ranging from 11 to 9.5 gpm. Almost all of the salt is separated from
the gas in the bulk-salt separator and returned to the salt pump. The gas
flows to the drain tank where it combines with the other gas flows. The
gas from the drain tank is either discarded to the stack or recycled to

the bubble generator. The bubble fraction in the loop is measured by a
gamma densitometer downstream of the bubble separator. The salt and gas
flow rates which can be obtained in the GSTF are equal to those anticipated
in the xenon removal side stream of a 150-Mw(t) MSR, and allow for large-
scale testing of many aspects of the xenon removal system.

Other work related to the fuel salt system will be carried out in indi-
vidual facilities or in the Components Test Facility (see Section 10.13).

10.4.5 Task 9.1.1 Gas-Systems Technology Facility water tests

After construction of the facility has been completed, components and
systems will be tested. In addition, the salt system will be operated
with water to determine the system operating characteristics and to test
various components such as the bubble generator-bubble separator.

10.4.5.1 Subtask 9.1.1.1 Test of the salt pump and variable flow
restrictors

The salt pump being used is a MSRE MARK II pump which has been modified
to obtain characteristics similar to the MSBR pump by altering the pump
inlet and volute. Since confidence in the calculations for mis-matched
impellers and volute is not adequate, the hydraulic performance of the

 

 

 
i

Sa

10-29

pump will be tested during the first stage of the water runs. The shaft
deflection will also be measured during this period. Based on this infor-
mation, the final pump modifications will be made including sizing of the
impeller. The pump and variable flow restrictors will then be calibrated.

The time and operating funds required for completion of facility con-
struction and shakedown are included in this subtask.

10.4.5.2 Subtask 9.1.1.2 Tests of the bubble generator-bubble separator

 

Helium will be injected into the water through the bubble generator and
removed at the bubble separator at flow rates in the range of those
anticipated for salt operation. The efficiency of the bubble separator
for gas removal will be determined, using the measured bubble fraction
downstream of the bubble separator and the gas flow rate tc the bubble
generator.

Some mass transfer information may be obtained by injecting oxygen inte
the bubble generator in order to saturate the water with oxygen; the rate
of change of oxygen concentration with time would then be determined after
resuming helium injection.

10.4.6 Task 9.1.2 Gas-Systems Technology Facility fuel-salt studies

 

10.4.6.1 Subtask 9.1.2.1 Bubble generator-bubble separator evaluation

 

After modifications have been made to the facility to allow salt operation,
the performance of the bubble generator and bubble separator will be eval-
uated using salt under various operating conditions. The effects of salt
redox potential on bubble generator-bubble separator performance will be
determined. If necessary, modifications to the bubble generator or bubble
separator will be made as the work progresses.

The time and funds spent modifying the system for salt operation, addition
of salt, and shakedown are included in this subtask.

10.4.6.2 Subtask 9.1.2.2 Tritium transport studies

The need for resolution of questions related to tritium management and
disposal has led to laboratory investigations of the chemical relation-
ships which govern tritium transport (see Section 5). As these studies
advance, it will be desirable to corroborate laboratory tests in an oper-
ating salt loop. Use may be made of tritium as a tracer in the investiga-
tion of diffusion or mass transfer. Alternately, deuterium might be used,
although its detection (by mass spectroscopy) is a factor of 103 less
sensitive than that for tritium.
10-30

106.4.6.3 Subtask 9.1.2.3 Salt chemistry studies

A number of studies related to salt chemistry are of interest, and the
need for others may become apparent as work progresses. One series of
experiments will be performed for determining the relationship between
u%+/U3t ratio and salt surface tension. This work is motivated by

the observations in the MSRE of lowered salt surface tension after ad-
justment of redox potential by the addition of metallic beryllium to

the fuel salt, and by questions relating to the effect of redox potential
on xenon removal efficiency.

The role of non-wetted metal particulates, and their relation to bubble
behavior also needs further study. Provisions will be made, if possible,
for careful evaluation of gas—borne species in terms of particle size
distribution and composition of particulates and gas, as a function of
the controlled chemical and operational parameters.

Sodium fluorocborate injection, detection and removal from fuel salt will
alsc be investigated.

10.4.6.4 Subtask 9.1.2.4 Mass-transfer studies

The mass transfer coefficient between a gas dissolved in a liquid and a

gas bubble is in general a function of the Schmidt and Reynolds moduli.

The parameters varied in water tests to date have been velocity, pipe
diameter, and kinematic viscosity: and since the tests were both isothermal
and isobaric, the diffusion cecefficient in the Schmidt modulus was a con-—
stant. The bubble size must also be known to determine the mass transfer
coefficient uniquely from the concentration-versus-time data taken in the
water tests. Until the advent of suitable instrumentation for determin-
ing bubble size in a high-temperature circulating salt, and in the absence
of knowledge about molecular diffusion of gases through salt, mass trans-
fer experimentation will be limited to a determination of the product of
the mass transfer coefficient and the effective bubble surface area.
Although this does not permit a general correlation, such information
would be useful in conjunction with data from the bubble generator tests
under the same conditions of salt flow, chemistry, temperature and stripper
gas void fraction. Measurements will be made of dissolved noble gas
(possibly using a radioactive tracer) as a function of time under various
conditions of salt flow rates, temperature, chemistry, and stripper gas
void fraction. Variation of test section diameter and orientation may
alsc be included.

10.4.6.5 Subtask 9.1.2.5 Heat transfer tests

 

To date; heat-transfer tests with MSBR fuel salt have involved once-through
test sections without the presence of gas bubbles. The Gas-Systems Tech~
nology Facility allows not only the corroboration of previous data but also
the determination of the effect of various gas void fractions on the heat-
transfer coefficients, both im fully-developed flow and in regions where
HER

pg]

10-31

boundary layers are developing. A resistance-heated tube, possibly similar
to the proposed primary heat-exchanger tubes, will be connected across two
of the capped pipe stubs provided. The variation of heat flux with Reynolds
modulus will be measured over the range of values expected in the MSBR core
and heat exchanger.

10.4.6.6 Subtask 9.1.2.6 Materials studies

 

Most of the materials development work for molten-salt reactors is covered
in Sections 2, 4, and 9. This subtask covers work for determining com-
patibility of materials with fuel salt under operating conditioms. Spec-
imens will be exposed to flowing salt streams and side loop studies will
be made using potential materials of construction.

10.4.6.7 Subtask 9.1.2.7 Salt jets development

Jets will be used in the MSBR to return overflow salt to the fuel-salt
circulating systems and to transfer salt between the drain tank, the salt
storage tank and the chemical processing facility. The design of these
jets should be similar to that of water jets; however, prototypes will
be tested in the Gas-Systems Technology Facility along with the proposed
siphon-break piping.

10.4.7 Task 9.1.3 Afterheat removal systems development

 

A drain tank system is needed for molten-salt reactors which will cool
the off-gas which passes through it and will remove the afterheat in case
of a quick drain after shutdown of power. The proposed cooling system is
similar to that used for the MSRE except that NaK thermal convection is
used instead of condensing steam. Although this is a very important
system, the design is straightforward and a minimum of development work
should be required. Details of the development work required have not
been determined.

10.4.8 Task 9.1.4 Salt sampler development

 

Although in-line analytical devices will be developed for future molten-
salt reactors, cccasional samples will need to be removed and analyzed
in a hot cell. A suitable sampling method will be developed.

10.4.9 Task 9.1.5 Parametric evaluation studies for xenon removal

Studies will be made tc determine the effects on xenon poisoning of such
variables as bubble diameter distribution, void fraction, bubble sep-
arator efficiency, mass transfer coefficients, permeability of graphite,
off-gas recycle time, iodine removal time, loop temperature, and loop
pressures. If additional development work is identified by these studies,
the work involved will be described in future subtasks.

10.5 TASK GROUP 9.2 COOLANT-SALT TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT

10.5.1 Objectives

The objective of this task group is to develop the technology that is
required for design, construction, and operation of the coclant-salt

system of a molten-salt test reactor, and for confident scale~up to a
melten—-salt demonstration reactor.

10.5.2 Schedule

Work on this task group is scheduled to begin in FY 1975 and will continue
through FY 1977 (see Table 10.5.2).

10.5.3 Funding

Operating funds required by this task group are shown in Table 10.5.3.

10.5.4 Facilities

The Coolant-Salt Technology Facility (CSTF) will serve as the primary
tocol for work in this task group. The facility, 33 shown schematically

in Fig. 10.5.4, consists of a pump, a salt-to-air heat exchanger, a load
orifice, a drain tank, a surveillance specimen assembly, a corrosion-
product trap, a salt monitoring vessel, and the necessary connecting
piping and auxiliary equipment. The main loop is constructed of 5-in.
Hastelloy N pipe and is equipped with smaller diameter pipe taps on both
the pump discharge and the pump suction lines to permit attachment of
parallel salt circuits that will be used individually or simultaneously
for future experiments. A fixed orifice, located at mid-loop, preduces

a pressure drop of 500 KN/m? (72 psi) and limits the main loop salt flow
to 50 liters/sec (785 gpm). Impact tubes and orifices are used to control
the salt flow at 0.13 liter/sec (2 gpm) in the salt monitoring vessel and
0.01 liter/sec (0.15 gpm) in the economizer loop. A mixture of helium
and BF; is supplied to the vapor space of the pump bowl for salt compo-
sition control, and pure helium enters the pump bowl as shaft purge. The
gas spaces in the pump bowl, float-type level chamber, salt monitoring
vessel, and cold trap are interconnected for liquid level control in
these chambers.

In addition to the CSTF, the Components Test Facility, the test reactor
mockup, the test reactor, and the demonstrator reactor will also advance
coolant-salt system technology.

10.5.5 Task 9.2.1 CSTF studies (fluoroborate salt)

 

This task group includes experimental studies performed in, or in connec-
tion with, the CSTF. The work consists of tests for determining the dis~-
tribution of hydrogen and deuterium in the CSTF from which the distribution
of tritium in the coolant system of an MSBR can be inferred, study of
corrosion product trapping, materials surveillance studies, and evaluation
of in-line analytical devices. Work is also included on the design and
evaluation of full-scale coolant-salt components; however, no experimental
work on the larger components is covered in this task group.

10.5.5.1 Subtask 9.2.1.1 Tritium distribution studies

 

Mathematical models have been devised for predicting the distribution of
tritium in molten-salt reactor systems.3s" A review will be made of all
pertinent calculations and additional calculations will be carried out as
necessary for planning and analyzing the experimental program prior to,
and in conjunction with, the deuterium-injection tests.

10.5.5.2 Subtask 9.2.1.2 Hydrogen- and deuterium—iniection tests

 

The objective of this work is to simulate the anticipated hehavior of
tritium in the coolant-salt system and to investigate the possibilities

of using that system as a barrier to resist migration of tritium from the
fuel system to the steam system and thus to keep the concentration of
tritium in the MSBR steam system from rising above the maximum acceptable
level.3¢ It is possible that certain hydrogenous materials in the coolant
salt may serve to sequester the tritium and thus prevent its diffusion
into the steam system.

The procedure for the initial injection experiments will be to allow a
known volume of deuterium to diffuse directly into the circulating salt
and, by appropriate sampling and analytical techniques, to determine the
resulting change in the deuterium concentrations in the salt and off-gas
streams.

The initial injection tests are expected to provide quantitative data

only on the deuterium content of the salt and the off-gas. Later tests
will be designed to yield quantitative data on the amount of deuterium
which diffuses through the walls of the salt piping, since this informa-
tion is essential to obtaining a meaningful deuterium material balance

and to predicting behavior of tritium in an MSBR. The equipment for these
tests may take the form of a test section inserted in one of the side loops
of the CSTF.

10.5.5.3 Subtask 9.2.1.3 Corrosion product trapping
The objectives of the corrosion-product trapping studies are to (1) demon-

strate that NajCrFg can be deposited onto a cold surface in an engineering-
scale sodium fluoroborate circulating loop, and (2) determine the character

 

 
 

 

10-37

of the deposit. A cold trap unit, installed in a side loop of the CSTF,
will be used for the corrosion product trapping studies. A description
of the cold trap and associated flow circuit is given in the Final Sys-
tem Design Description33 for the CSTF.

The corrosion product trapping studies will be carried out im two phases.
The first phase will consist of observations and studies which are made
while other work, such as deuterium injection and salt chemistry studies,
is being carried out. During this phase, the cold trap studies will be
of lower priority than the other work. The second phase of the experi-
mental work will consist of studies wherein the types of deposits and
rates of deposition are observed under conditions where the impurity level
in the salt is adjusted by means of controlled additions. Tests will be
carried out in which the chromium content of the salt will be changed by
direct chromium addition, and in which steam will be injected directly
into the salt.

10.5.5.4 Subtask 9.2.1.4 Salt chemistry

The chemistry of sodium fluoroborate is being studied to (1) develop
information in support of the tritium and corrosion experiments, and
(2) develop techniques for sampling and in-line analysis which are suit-
able for large molten-salt reactors. A salt-monitoring vessel is pro-
vided in the CSTF which will be used for testing in-line analytical
techniques for measurements such as proton concentration in the salt.
The primary work regarding salt chemistry is covered in Sections 5 and
6. The effort in this subtask will be restricted to (1) assisting in-
vestigators in application of the CSTF to the various problem areas,
and (2) demonstrating through operation of the CSTF that proposed solu-
tions are applicable to an actual reactor system.

10.5.5.53 Subtask 9.2.1.5 Materials surveillance tests

 

The materials surveillance tests will be conducted using the specimen
surveillance system which is provided in the CSTF. Because of plans

for using the specimen surveillance assembly in the deuterium-injection
tests, the assembly has been redesigned so that it will be able to serve
the dual role of injection tube and specimen holder. 36

The objective of the material surveillance tests is to provide informa-
tion on the compatibility of the NaBF,~NaF salt with Hastelloy N and
with other selected materials. Corrosion, as indicated by the surveil-
lance specimens, will be determined by weight change measurements,
dimensional changes, and metallography on portions of the specimens.
Execution of these tests will be handled as a part of the materials
development effort which is covered in Section 2.
 

 

10-38
10.5.6 Task 9.2.2 Evaluation and design of larger components for
coolant-salt technology development

The objective of this task is to evaluate the performance of full-scale

coolant-salt components and systems. A single coolant loop in the ref-

erence design MSBR operates with a salt flow rate of 1 m3/sec (16,000

gpm) which is a factor of 20 larger than that for the CSTF. The experi- a
ence gained in the execution of Task 9.2.1 in the CSTF will be applied

to the designs of full-scale models of the celd trap, the BF3; economizer,

and the particle traps, and components of similar design will be tested .
in the Components Test Facility.

10.6 TASK GROUP 9.3 STEAM TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT

10.6.1 Objective

The objective of this task group is to develop the technology required
for the reliable evaluation, design, and fabrication of molten-salt-
heated steam generators. wi

Liquid-heated steam generators are relatively new in the power generation
field, and much development effort will be required to provide a molten-

salt-heated steam generator with the essential characteristics of relia-
bility, safety, performance, maintainability, and economy.
In order that steam generators can be supplied that will operate in a i

safe and reliable manner, work is outlined in this task group for de-
veloping the technology and skills required to complete this objective.
Portions of the extensive development work being done with liquid-metal- wa
heated steam generators will be useful to the Molten-Salt Reactor Program.
The liquid-metal and the molten-salt steam generators have many problems
in common and the LMFBR experience will be used in planning the necessary
development program to achieve the objective of this task group.

10.6.2 Schedule Fd

The schedule for work in this task group is shown in Table 10.6.2.
The plan for the development of steam-system technology is aimed almost
entirely at the interface between the coolant salt and the steam system.
The plan is divided into five progressive tasks, with interfaces between
tasks selected to provide advanced levels of confidence in the technology
before the commitment is made to proceed into the next task. The first
task (9.3.1), which is presently in progress, is the beginning of the
industrial program and involves industry in performing conceptual design i
studies of molten-salt steam generators. This design-study task, which
will be completed in FY 1976, will provide industrial recommendations
for development requirements.

The second task (9.3.2) will consist of small-scale exploratory develop-
ment necessary for the design and operation of a multitube steam generator
assembly described under the third task (9.3.3). Also, the second task
will begin preliminary design of startup and control systems for steam
generators, and development of fabrication techniques and alternate mate-
rials in support eof the third task. Small-scale tests of 100 to 150 kW
will be performed using a side stream of the CSTF. The work of this

task should be well underway by the end of ¥Y 1978 to provide a firm

basis for beginning design of the Steam Generator Tube Test Stand (STTS)
of the third task (9.3.3).

The third task (9.3.3) will incorporate the development results obtained
thus far into the design of a Steam Generator Tube Test Stand incorporat-
ing several full-size steam tubes (STTS). Multitube test assemblies of
industrial design will be operated in the STTS.

The fourth task (9.3.4) will involve the design, construction, and opera-
tion of the Steam Generator Model Test Installation (SGMTI). Although
task 9.3.3 will not be complete in FY 1981, the necessary information
from this task will be available for the design of the model steam gen-
erator and the SGMTI by this time.

The fifth task involves establishing the equipment and controls criteria
necessary for all steam generator operating modes. After the successful
test has demonstrated the adequacy of the basic design criteria of the
model steam generator and its support equipment, the final design, fab-
rication, and testing of MSTR prototype steam generators will begin in

FY 1981 (see Section 13). The molten-salt test reactor mockup (MSTRM)

will contain at least one steam generator unit in the mockup of the coolant
system along with the required over-pressure protection system. Although
only limited steam generator performance tests can be performed in the
mockup, the safety of the steam generator and its over-pressure protection
system will be demonstrated by simulating a steam tube rupture. Procedures
for semi~direct maintenance, cleanup after a tube rupture, and inservice
inspection will be tested by FY 1686.

10.6.3 Funding

Operating fund requirements for this task group are given in Table 10.6.3.1,
and capital equipment fund requirements are given in Table 10.6.3.2,

Authorization of funds for the design and construction of the Steam Generator
Tube Test Stand in the amount of $4 million will be required early in FY
1979. Authorization of funds for the design and construction of the Model
Steam Generator Test Installation in the amount of $20 million will be re-
quired early in FY 1981.

10.6.4 Facilities

The facilities necessary for steam-system technology development will con-
sist for the most part of molten-salt facilities with the steam generator
as the primary focus. Steam-system equipment not in contact with salt
will involve the scale-up and adaptation of existing technology and will
be done by industrial firms.

The facilities required for the development of molten-salt steam generators

are covered in the following subsections.

10.6.4.1 Facilities for Task 9.3.1 Industrial steam generator
conceptual design studies

 

 

No hardware is required for this portion of the industrial program which
is presently in progress. As discussed in Subtask 9.3.1.4, the industrial
firm performing this study will make recommendations for a development
program for molten~salt steam generators.

10.6.4.2 Facilities for Task 9.3.2 Small-scale exploratory development

 

Exploratory development will be performed both as secondary function tests
in other salt test facilities and as primary function tests in new test
facilities.

The Coolant-Salt Technology Facility will be utilized for small-scale,
single-tube, steam generation tests (Subtask 9.3.2.1), and for preliminary
development of a steam-leak detector system (Subtask 9.3.2.3). Separate
facilities will be required for development of a pressure relief device
(Subtask 9.3.2.2) and for steam wastage parameters (Subtask 9.3.2.4).

The development of fabrication techniques and alternative materials
(Subtasks 9.3.2.6 and 9.3.2.7) are material development problems and

will be performed in existing materials development facilities.

Small-scale facilities will be required for obtaining precise thermal,
hydraulic, and physical data for the coolant salt (Subtask 9.3.2.8) such

as have been measured for other salts. In addition to the engineering
properties data at normal operating temperatures, a special investigation
will be made of the coolant salt near its liquidus temperature (Subtask
9.3.2.9) since portions of a steam generator will operate near the liquidus
temperature. Investigations will be performed to determine the macroscopic
density change of the coolant at both the liquidus and the solid-phase
transition temperature. Information on the resistance of the salt to ex-
trusion will be measured.
10-48

10.6.4.3 Facilities for Task 9.3.3 Preliminary steam generator
design and development

The major facility for this task is the Steam Generator Tube Test Stand
{STTS) which will require a heat source of about 3 MW(t) and must accom-
modate full-length, multitube test assemblies, which will be designed

by industrial firms. See Subtasks 9.3.3.1 through 9.3.3.8.

The SITS will include a system for circulating molten salt and a steam~
feedwater system that can be operated at subcritical or supercritical
pressures. Feedwater treatment will be equivalent to that of super-
critical power plants. In addition to the required subsystems for support
of the salt and steam—-feedwater systems, a pressure relief system will

be required to protect the salt piping from overpressure in the event

of a steam-tube failure.

10.6.4.4 Facilities for Task 9.3.4 Model testing in the Steam Generator
Model Test Installation (SGMTI)

 

 

Steam generator models of 20- to 25-MW({t) capacity will be tested in the
Steam Generator Model Test Installation which will be located in the Com-
ponents Test Facility (described in Task Group 9.10). This installation
will consist of a 30-MW{t) salt heater, coolant salt system, over pressure
protection system, supercritical steam system, heat dump and other support
equipment necessary to simulate important portions of a steam generator
and allow study of the phenomena which take place in a molten-salt~heated
steam generator.

10.6.5 Task 9.3.1 Industrial steam generator conceputal design studies

 

A conceptual design study, presently in progress by Foster Wheeler Corpo-
ration, under OBNL subcontract, will include conceptual designs, recom-—
mendations for steam generator development and critical reviews of present
plans.

10.6.5.1 Subtask 9.3.1.1 Conceptual design for a 1000-MW{e) MSBR

Foster Wheeler Corporation, under ORNL subcontract, is preparing a con-
ceptual design of a steam generator for the 1000-MW(e)} MSBR reference
‘plant. This steam generator is to utilize a supercritical steam cycle
to produce steam at 1000°F and 3500 psia from feedwater at 700°F.

10.6.5.2 Subtask 9.3.1.2 Feasibility study for use of lower
feedwater temperature

 

Foster Wheeler Corporation, under ORNL subcontract, will investigate the
feasibility of using a lower feedwater temperature of 500 to 600°F with

 
 

ER

10-49

both supercritical and subcritical steam systems. If the results of the
investigation are favorable, conceptual designs will be prepared for one
or both conditions.

10.6.5.3 Subtask 9.3.1.3 Conceptual design of MSTR steam generator

A steam generator conceptual design will be prepared of a size appropriate
for the MSTR; however, the steam generator size has not been fixed at this
time, The design will be based on an evaluation of the results of sub-
tasks 9.3.1.1 and 9.3.1.2 above.

16.6.5.4 Subtask 9.3.1.4 Recommend R & D program

After completing Subtasks 9.3.1.1 through 9.3.1.3, Foster Wheeler Corpora-
tion, under ORNL subcontract, will recommend a research and development
program for carrying out the work necessary for development of steam
generators in view their experience with conventional steam generator
design and with the background of having performed molten-salt steam
generator studies. A reevaluation and possible redirection of emphasis
for the remainder of the steam generator development program is possible
as a result of these recommendations.

10.6.5.5 Subtask 9.3.1.4 Critical review of Hastelloy N—steam
corrosion work

Foster Wheeler Corporation, under ORNL subcontract, will provide a crit-—
ical review of past and present Hastelloy N-to-steam corrosion work and
make recommendations on steam generator materials. It is likely that these
recommendations will lead to further materials studies since only limited
work has been done on materials behavior in salt-steam environments.

10.6.5.6 Subtask 9.3.1.6 Critical review of ORNL plans for CSTF

Foster Wheeler Corporation, under ORNL subcontract, will review and
evaluate ORNL's steam generator technology loop (which will operate in
conjunction with the CSTF, Task 9.2.1). A small test of 100 to 150 kW(t)
will be described in a conceptual design report. See Subtask 9.3.2.1.

10.6.6 Task 9.3.2 Design studies and small scale exploratory
development

10.6.6.1 Subtask 9.3.2.1 Small scale steam generator tests in the
CSTF (See para 10.5.4)

Important preliminary information concerning the generation of steam

in a molten-salt-heated exchanger will be obtained as a basis for pro-
ceeding with larger-scale steam generator development. A small bypass
on the CSTF will be used to supply salt at a sufficient rate to provide
10-50

50 to 150 kW of heat to the exchanger. Information will be developed
on desirable tube configurations, heat transfer coefficients, and flow
stability.

10.6.6.2 Subtask 9.3.2.2 Development of a molten-salt pressure relief
device ss

To prevent overpressure of the coolant-salt system in the event of a

steam tube failure, a pressure relief device and a collection system a
for the effluent must be provided. A device must be developed which

will operate reliably at high temperature and in contact with molten

salt. This device may be an adaptation of an existing device.

16.6.6.3 Subtask 9.3.2.3 Development of small-leak detection system

 

The CSTF will be used to develop methods for detecting small steam leaks
into the coolant salt. Early detection of a small steam leak from the
steam generator will allow shutdown and repair before the failure pro-
gresses to the stage where the pressure relief system would be brought
into service. Injections of water inte the coolant salt of the CSTF
and the evaluation of various leak-detection methods will form the
basis for further development in the larger steam generator facilities
to follow.

16.6.6.4 Subtask 9.3.2.4 Determination of small-leak wastage parameters

 

Information on the extent of damage and the wastage rate of steam tube Li
walls vs leak size will provide plant shut-down criteria. Wastage
parameters will provide input to the steam generator design concerning
tube geometry, spacing, etc. The experience of the LMFBR program will
be utilized in obtaining wastage parameters with static-pot tests.

10.6.6.5 Subtask 9.3.2.5 Preliminary design study of steam generator i
startup and control systems

 

The startup system must provide for the initial coupling of the salt- Hs
heated steam generator to the steam system without freezing of salt and

with a minimum of thermal shock. A separate fossil-fired startup system

with a capacity of about 10Z of rated plant capacity may be necessary.

Preliminary studies, including computer simulations, will investigate &
various startup and control schemes and provide a basis for further

development in the large steam generators to follow.

 
10-51

10.6.6.6 Subtask 9.3.2.6 Develop fabrication techniques for steam
generator

Specific joint designs, fabrication procedures, and inspection procedures
have not been chosen at this time. Problems will be resolved as they
arise in the design and with the participation of industrial firms.

10.6.6.7 Subtask 9.3.2.7 Investigate and develop alternative steam
generator materials

In the event that Hastelloy N is incompatible with steam under stress,

other materials will be investigated. Information on the compatibility
of many materials, including Incoloy 800 and Inconel 600, with steam is
available. However, the evaluation of these materials in contact with

coolant salt will be necessary.

An evaluation will be made of duplex tubing as a solution to the materials
problem, where each side of the tube is compatible with its respective
environment, namely, Incoloy 800 with steam and nickel with the coolant
salt. The main problems to be resolved are the integrity of the bimetal
interface and joining techniques.

10.6.6.8 Subtasks 9.3.2.8 and 9.3.2.9

 

These two subtasks are concerned with physical properties of the coolant
salt that are of particular importance to the steam generator design.

In addition to the more accurate engineering data necessary over the
normal operating temperature range (Subtask 9.3.2.8), additional informa-
tion is needed in the region near the salt liquidus temperature.
Temperatures at the inside tube wall at the tube sheet surface near the
feedwater inlet will be below the salt liquidus and, therefore, some

salt freezing will occur. The nature of the frozen salt layer and the
possible mechanical consequences of the freezing and thawing of this
layer must be better understood. This subtask will investigate the
possibility of determining an extrusion coefficient by methods similar

to those used in the extrusion of metals. With this information, stresses
resulting from the density change in thawing salt could be calculated

and accommodated in the steam generator design.

The two subtasks associated with coolant-salt properties are as follows:
Subtask 9.3.2.8 — Assess the adequacy of the thermal-hydraulic and
physical property data for the coolant salt (see Task Group 9.2)

for steam generator design needs.

Subtask 9.3.2.9 — Determine extrusion coefficient and investigate
other physical properties of coolant salt near liquidus temperature.
10-52

10.6.6.9 Subtask 9.3.2.10 Update R & D program plan

 

As a result of the industrial design studies of steam generators (Sub-
task 9.3.1.4) and the small scale exploratory development work (Task
9.3.2) up to this point, the overall development plan will be reexamined
for proper direction and emphasis.

10.6.7 Task 9.3.3 Steam Generator Tube Test Stand design,
construction, and operation
The purpose of task 9.3.3 is to establish a more firm understanding of

the critical engineering features of molten-salt-heated steam generators.

10.6.7.1 Subtasks 9.3.3.1 through 9.3.3.8

 

The subtasks of this task are concerned with a 3-MW(t) molten-salt Steam
Generator Tube Test Stand (STTS) in which three or more full size steam
tubes will be tested. These tests will range from evaluation of the
thermal and mechanical stability of some design features to the operation
of some full-size steam tubes in the STTS for evaluation of performance
under full heat flux conditions. The larger-scale tests requiring a
heated circulating salt system would be conducted in the STTS.

A Conceptual System Design Description of a 3-MW facility of this type
has been completed. The primary functions of the SITS are to:

1. Perform steady-state part- and full-rated load tests on clusters
of full-size, full-length tubes in a configuration representative
of MSTR-MSBR steam generators.

2. Perform transient studies associated with load changes at rates
up to 5%Z/min over the range from 20 to 100% of full load.

3. Demonstrate startup of steam generators that use high-melting-
point salts for the heat source.

4. Provide a single test facility for the evaluation of steam
generator test sections from several industrial firms.

5. Continue the demonstration of the technology for sodium fluoro-
borate or other fluoride salts necessary for their application
to steam generation in the following task (9.3.4) of model
testing.

The power rating of 3 MW for the test stand is based on the need to
evaluate the flow stability in the tubes of a multi-tube test assembly.
Although the design provides for a minimum of three tubes in a test
assembly, studies of steam generators for the MSBR reference design
indicate that none of the systems proposed would have tubes of 1-MW (th)
size, and that the size would be closer to 1/4 MW(th). Seven to 12

 
po

10-53

tubes would be used in the stability tests. The design of the facility
may have to be modified to satisfy requirements resulting from the in-
dustrial design studies conducted in Task 9.3.1 in order to incorporate
recommendations of the industrial designer.

The subtasks associated with the STTS are as follows:

Subtask 9.3.3.1 — Conceptual design of Steam Generator Tube Test
Stand (STTS)

Subtask 9.3.3.2 — Establish criteria and design pressure relief
systems for the SITS

Subtask 9.3.3.3 — Establish maintenance criteria and develop
necessary procedures for maintenance, cleaning, and in-service
inspection

Subtask 9.3.3.4 — Title I and Title II design of the STTS
Subtask 9.3.3.5 — Fabrication of the STTS

Subtask 9.3.3.6 — Industrial design of multi-tube test assembly
for STTS

Subtask 9.3.3.7 — Industrial fabrication of test assembly for STTS

Subtask 9.3.3.8 — Operation of the STTS with multitube assemblies

10.6.8 Task 9.3.4 Model testing in the Steam Generator Model Test
Installation (SGMTI) — Subtasks 9.3.4.1 through 9.3.4.11

Model testing of a molten-salt steam generator will be done in a test
facility with functions and a size similar to that of the Sodium Compo-
nents Test Installation (SCTI) of the IMFBR Program. This test facility
will supply about 20 to 30 MW of heat to a molten-salt-heated steam
generator model and will include all of the auxiliary systems and support
equipment necessary to subject the model to conditions simulating those
expected in service.

The test facility will include the necessary salt handling and circulating
system, salt heater, cover gas and leak detection system, overpressure
protection system, salt diversion valves and system controls to apply
temperature ramps and control transients, a supercritical steam generator,
and a startup system to provide initial coupling without excessive thermal
shock and without freezing salt.

The steam generator model will be designed and fabricated by industry
and will incorporate the results of the design and preliminary testing
experience available at that time. The industrial firm supplying the
model steam generator will participate heavily in the definition of the
test program and the development of its supporting systems.

10.6.9 Task 9.3.5 Equipment and controls criteria development

 

The type and size of equipment for the steam generator auxiliary system
is a major uncertainty due to the lack of experience in this area.

size of the startup system, for example, will depend on how stably the

steam generator operates at low loads.

the best thermal-hydraulic characterisitcs available at the time will

guide the design of the steam generator and provide feedback to the con-

trol criteria. Temperature transients due to both normal and abnormal
operating conditions and the thermal stresses they bring about must be
included in information available to the designers. Other equipment

development needs such as a bypass or diversion valve will be evaluated

on the basis of computer simulator studies. This subtask interfaces
strongly with Tasks 11.1.1 and 11.1.2.

10.7 TASK GROUP 9.4 COVER- AND OFF-GAS SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT

10.7.1 Objective

The objective of this task group is to develop the technology that is
needed for the design of the cover- and off-gas systems and components
of a molten~salt test reactor and for confident scale-up to a molten-
salt demonstration reactor.

10.7.2 Schedule

The schedule for work in this task group is given in Table 10.7.2.

16.7.3 Funding

The operating fund requirements for this task group are shown in Table
16.7.3. Capital equipment funds in the amount of $40,000 will be re-

quired during FY 1978 for equipment and instrumentation to be used in

the charcoal tests (Subtask 9.4.2.1).

10.7.4 Facilities

The Gas System Technology Facility (GSTF) and the Coolant-Salt Tech-
nology Facility (CSTF) will be used for work in this task group during
the initial phases of the program. These facilities, which are described
in Sections 10.4.4 and 10.5.4, will be used for particle trap studies
(Subtasks 9.4.1.1 and 2), BF; management studies (Subtask 9.4.2.4), and
removal of tritium from coolant salt (Subtask 9.4.2.5).

The charcoal tests (Subtask 9.4.2.1) will require a special test facility
but one which should be modest in size, complexity and cost. The facility
will include charcoal-filled pipes equipped with heaters and temperature
controls, a gas supply system with flow controls, and provisions for
cbtaining gas samples and making radiation counts. The arrangement will
be similar to that used previously. 32

Special test facilities will be required for the tritium and noble-~gas-
removal tests (Subtasks 9.4.2.2 and 3). The facilities will be scale
models of systems which are proposed for the molten-salt test reactor
and they will be designed as a proof test of system performance. These
same facilities may also be adapted for use in performance testing of
the recycle gas compressor (Subtask 9.4.2.6).

10.7.5 Task 9.4.1 Handling of non-volatile constituents
The offgas stream from the reference MSBR31 primary system will contain

mists or smokes at relatively low concentration (probably somewhere be-
tween 100 and 10600 ppm by volume) and constituted as follows:

1. Fuel salt particles, generated in the pump bowl and the bubble
separator, having potential sizes ranging from 1 to 10 microns.

2. An estimated3’ 1% to 50% of the noble metal (“!Nb through 52Te) -
fission products as particles ranging in size from 0.01 to 10 u.
For a 2250-MW(t) reactor, the mass flow rate could be as high as N

300 grams per day.

3. Non-volatile fission product daughters of Kr and Xe. The assump-
tion is made that noble gas daughters which are born in the salt i
will be retained in the salt as fluorides. For a 2200-MW(t)
reactor, and assuming a 2-hour gas holdup volume, an estimated
140 grams per day of noble-gas daughters will be formed im the
primary salt drain tank.

The off-gas stream from the coolant salt system is expected to contain
salt mist particles in about the same size range and concentration as

the fuel system off-gas. However, the composition of the salt will be
different and there will be no fission products, no radioactivity (except
for some short-lived induced activity), and no decay heat. Er

10.7.5.1 Subtask 9.4.1.1 Particle trap for fuel system off-gas

 

In the MSBR reference design, 31 a particle trap may be required at the
cutlet of the fuel salt drain tank. A particle trap will not be required
if the drain tank serves as an efficient particle trap.

 

The objective of this task is to develop the technology related to the

removal of particles by the drain tank to the point where a firm decision Gi
can be made regarding the need for a particle trap. The initial approach
will be to assume that the Gas-System Technology Facility (GSTF) is repre-
sentative of a reactor system. The rate of salt mist carryover from the
GSTF drain tank will be measured and, if possible, tests will be devised

to study the carryover of noble metals and noble-gas daughters. If the
test results indicate that solids carryover will be a problem and that

a particle trap will be required, work will be initiated on particle trap
concepts and any accompanying experimental effort which might be indicated.

10.7.5.2 Subtask 8.4.1.2 Particle trap for coolant system off-gas

 

The initial objective of this task is to examine the problem of coolant-
salt mist carryover and to determine whether a particle trap will be
required. If a trap is required, criteria will be established for its
design. Input data for the evaluation and design will be obtained from
the operating experience with the CSTF off-gas system.

10-59

10.7.5.3 Subtask 9.4.1.3 Non-volatile fission product disposal

 

The objective of this task is to determine an acceptable procedure for
disposing of solid fission products which accumulate in the charcoal beds
or other parts of the off-gas system.

10.7.6 Task 9.4.2 Handling of volatile constituents

 

The off-gas stream from both the fuel system and the coolant system of

the reference MSBR3! will contain volatile constituents which will pre-
sent management or disposal problems. The fuel system offgas will con~
tain radioactive krypton and xenon as well as tritium. This gas will be
passed through charcoal delay beds to allow the decay of short-lived iso-
topes, after which the Kr-85 and tritium would be placed in a satisfactory
form for disposal. The coolant-system offgas will contain BF; and tritium
which must be placed in a form allowing disposal.

10.7.6.1 Subtask 9.4.2.1 Charcoal bed holdup test for fuel system off-gas

The reference design MSBR includes a charcoal delay bed through which the
fuel system off-gas passes. Parts of the delay bed system operate at
temperatures as high as 250°C. The effluent gas, after suitable cleanup,
is recycled to the purge gas supply system. Adsorption coefficient data
will be determined experimentally for the expected operating temperature
range in order to augument the present data which extend to only 100°C.
Also, tests will be made to determine the effect on the adsorption co-
efficient of solids deposition resulting from fission preduct decay. A
study will be made to determine what procedures will be necessary to
handle adsorbed materials such as oxygen and water which might be present
in the as-received charcoal. Also, the thermal stability of charcoal will
be examined to determine whether operation at 250°C causes evolution of
organic materials or degradation of physical properties.

For determining the adsorption coefficients, a test setup similar to the
one used for making the low temperature tests32 will be required. By
also adding the necessary sampling or analytical equipment, the same sys-
tem can be used for the cleanup and thermal stability tests.

10.7.6.2 Subtask 9.4.2.2 Removal of tritium from fuel system off-gas

In the reference design MSBR, tritium in the fuel system off-gas will be
reacted with hot CuO to form tritiated water which will be isolated by
means of a refrigerated adsorbent. The technology for this process is
well established and experimental work will be limited to proof-testing
of the method in a mockup of the system.
10-60

10.7.6.3 Subtask 9.4.2.3 Removal of Kr-85 and stable Kr and Xe from
fuel system off-gas

A 2250-MW(t) reactor will produce sbout 60 liters per day of Kr-85 plus
stable Kr and Xe. This material, along with the tritiated water (see
previous section) will be isclated by means of a refrigerated adsorbent.
The technology for this process is well established and experimental work
will be limited to proof-testing of the method in a mockup of the system.
The mockup would be designed to demonstrate the performance and reliabil-
ity of the Cul reactor for tritium oxidation and the refrigerated adsor-
bent and liquid-nitrogen trap for isolating the noble gases and the
tritiated water.

10.7.6.4 Subtask 9.4.2.4 Management of BF3 in coolant system off-gas

 

Methods will be developed for safe and economical management of BFj3 in
the coolant cover~ and off-gas system. This subtask would include design
and experimental work needed to develop a BF3 recycle system. Input data
for this task will be obtained through operating experience with the BF;
economizer which is installed in the CSTF.

16.7.6.5 Subtask 9.4.2.5 Removal of tritium from coolant system off-gas

About 2500 curies per day of tritium will be produced in a 2250-MW(t)
molten-salt reactor. A large fraction of this gas is expected to be
transported from the fuel system into the coolant system. A method will
be developed for handling and disposing of the tritium which is trans-
ported into the coolant salt off-gas system. Work in this subtask will
be closely coordinated with the previous subtask (BF3 management) to
ensure that the respective approaches are compatible. The approach to
this problem may be strongly affected by information developed in the
deuterium—injection tests (Subtask 9.2.1.2) and related work.

10.7.6.6 Subtask 9.4.2.6 Recycle-gas compressor

 

The reference design MSBR specifies that the primary system off-gas will
be recompressed and reused as purge gas for the primary system. The
objective of this subtask is to provide the engineering effort needed to
identify a commercial compressor, or develop a compressor which will do
the job effectively and reliably without contaminating the pumped fluid
with wet air or other materials. Design criteria will be established
after which the availability of commerical units will be determined.

10.8 TASK GROUP 9.5 SALT PUMP DEVELOPMENT

10.8.1 Objectives

The objectives of this task group include the development of the tech-
nology necessary for design of short-shaft salt pumps for molten-salt
test and demonstration reactors and the procurement and testing of full-
scale prototypical pumps for the test and demonstration reactors. It

is recognized that industrial participation via ORNL subcontract or
industry-supported development is an important factor, and appropriate
measures will be taken to ensure that this input will be forthcoming.
Another objective is the investigation of salt-lubricated bearings, and
their development to a point that a long-shaft prototype pump can be
designed.

To the extent possible, the pumps required for the molten-salt test
reactor will be the same as those to be used in the demonstration reactor
in order that the number of prototype salt pumps to be developed will be
minimized.

10.8.2 Schedule

The schedule for work in this task group is shown in Table 10.8.2. Work
on the short shaft pump will start as soon as pump requirements have
been determined in FY 1978. The specifications would be completed, and
requests for industrial bids would be issued in FY 1978. After bid
evaluation, conceptual design by industry of the MSTR prototype pump
would be started in FY 1979. Detail design will start in FY 1980, and
construction in FY 1981. Delivery of a prototype pump would be expected
by the end of ¥Y 1983. The design of the pump test stand for the Compo-
nents Test Facility would start in FY 1979, which would be sufficiently
early for the test stand to be ready by the time the pump arrives. Pump
testing will start in FY 1983.

The development of molten-salt-lubricated bearings for a long-shaft pump
will be started in FY 1980 in case the design indicates an advantage to
using this type pump. If this occurs, additional work would be required
to develop this pump type.

10.8.3 Funding

Operating fund requirements for the task group are shown in Table 10.8.3.
The largest expense item is associated with the design and construction

of the prototype pump. Authorization of funds ($1 million) for the design
and construction of the Salt Pump Test Stand will be required in FY 1980.

10.8.4 Facilities

Most of the development will be done in the Salt Pump Test Stand in the
Components Test Facility (10.13).

10.8.5 Task 9.5.1 Development of short-shaft pumps

10.8.5.1 Subtask 9.5.1.1 Develop specifications for a pretotype pump
for the molten-salt test reactor

 

In 1969, detailed specifications were developed for a primary salt pump
(Spec. M-10554-RB-001-X-0) and a secondary pump (Spec. M-10554-RB-002-X-0)
for the Molten-Salt Breeder Experiment. These specifications would be
thoroughly reviewed and modified as necessary in view of the molten-salt
test reactor requirements, and industrial bids would be solicited for a
prototype pump for the molten-salt test reactor.

10.8.5.2 Subtask 9.5.1.2 Evaluate industrisl bids for the prototype pump
After all the bids have been received they will be thoroughly analyzed

to ensure that the desired design procedures will be carried out.

10.8.5.3 Subtask 9.5.1.3 Industrial design of prototype pump

 

This subtask will involve both conceptual and final protoype pump design
and will include independent review and approval.

10.8.5.4 Subtask 9.5.1.4 Construct protoiype pump

 

One or more prototype pumps will be constructed by one or more qualified
vendors with periodic consultations and inspections by an independent
reviewer.

10.8.5.5 Subtask 9.5.1.5 Design pump test stand in the Components Test
Facility

 

A preliminary design description for a pump test stand for an MSBE size
pump was written in 1969. This information will be the basis for the
design of the pump test stand in the Components Test Facility.

10.8.5.6 Subtask 9.5.1.6 Construct pump test stand in the Components
Test Facility

 

This subtask covers the construction of the pump test stand and in-
stallation of the prototype pump.

10.8.5.7 Subtask 9.5.1.7 Test prototype pump

 

Some cf the tests to be done in the pump test stand are listed below:

 
10-65

1. Obtain the pump hydraulic performance and cavitation inception
characteristics over a wide range of pump speeds, capacities,
and temperatures.

2. Determine the startup and coastdown characteristics of the pump
and drive motor under load conditions.

3. Determine the characteristics of the purge gas flow in the shaft
annulus.

4. Determine the distribution of salt aerosols produced by pump
operation and obtain the performance characteristics of aerosol
removal devices, if necessary.

5. Demonstrate the operability of the incipient failure detection
(IFD) devices.

6. Obtain long-term endurance operation with prototypic pumps.

7. Make molten-salt proof tests of advanced instrumentation for
molten~salt systems as it becomes available.

10.8.6 Task 9.5.2 Development of molten-sazlt-lubricated bearings
10.8.6.1 Subtask 9.5.2.1 Status of technology report

This subtask will involve a literature search and consultations with
IMFER personnel and with Mechanical Technology, Inc. personnel in order
te determine and summarize the status of development of long-shaft
pumps for molten-salt service.

10.8.6.2 Subtask 9.5.2.2 Define and perform development program

Based on the technology report, a detailed development program will be
outlined and carried out which will provide information necessary for
the design of large scale long~shaft pumps. Current information indi-
cates that this will include fabrication of long shafts to precise
concentricity, straightness, and dymamic balancing, as well as provid-
ing mechanical devices to accommodate the relatively large differential
thermal expansion that occurs between a shaft and bearing support con-
structed of Hastelloy N and journals and sleeves constructed of refrac-
tory metals or cemented carbides having smaller coefficients of thermal
expansion.

10.9 TASK GROUP 9.6 PRIMARY SALT-SALT HEAT EXCHANGER DEVELOPMENT

10.9.1 Objective

The objective of this task group is to develop the technology which will
allow detailed design of a primary heat exchanger for the molten-salt
test reactor. Final optimization of heat exchanger design tc minimize
fuel salt inventory for the molten-salt demonstration reactor and MSBR
will be done after tests in the molten salt test reactor.

10.9.2 Schedule

As indicated in Table 10.9.2, the status of technology report should be
completed in FY 1981, and development work finished in FY 1983.

10.9.3 Funding

Operating fund requirements for this task group are shown in Table 10.9.3.

The higher rate of spending in FY 1983 is associated with proof testing
for the molten-salt test reactor. Capital equipment funds of $50,000
will be required during FY 1982 for modification of the GSTF and CSTF
to allow heat exchange studies.

10.9.4 Facilities
Some of the early work in this task group will be dome in the Coolant-
Salt Technology Facility (CSTF) (10.5.4) and Gas-Systems Technology

Facility (GSTF) (10.4.4) with later development in the Components Test
Facility.

10.9.5 Task 9.6.1 Status of technology report

 

A literature search will be carried out with special emphasis on recent
enhanced tube development work which would reduce the required heat
transfer surface area and the fuel salt inventory requirements.

10.9.6 Task 9.6.2 Define and perform development program

 

Based on the technology report, a development program will be outlined
and carried out to obtain the additional technology necessary for design
of a primary heat exchanger for the molten-salt test reactor. Small
scale heat transfer studies with enchanced tubes will be made in the
Coolant-S5alt Technology Facility and Gas-Systems Technology Facility.
The effect of gas voids on heat transfer will be studied in the latter.

10.10 TASK GROUP 9.7 VALVE DEVELOPMENT

The Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment used no valves in salt in the reactor i»
primary system and only small freeze valves in the drain line and in the =
drain tank system. Larger freeze valves and/or mechanical valves for use

in salt will be needed for molten-salt breeder reactors.

10.10.1 Gbjective

The cbjective of this task group is to advance high-temperature valve

technology sufficiently to enable design of shuteff, throttling, and

diversion type valves for MSR applications. »
10.10.2 Schedule

The schedule for work on valve development is shown in Table 10.10.Z.
Work will begin in FY 1978 with preparation of a status of technology
report, definition of the development program, and conceptual design -
of the Valve Test Facility. Detailed design and construction of this
facility will be completed during FY 1980. Work will continue through
FY 1984 for developing valves as required for the molten-salt test
reactor.

 

Operating fund requirements for this task group are shown in Table

10.10.3. Capital equipment funds in the amount of $250,000 will be i
required in FY 1979 for design and construction of the Valve Test

Facility.

10.10.4 Facilities

The Coolant-Salt Technology Facility and the Gas-System Techmology Facility — &
will be used for some of the early valve development work; however a sep~
arate small facility is needed for use in making preliminary tests on
models or prototypes of reactor valves. This facility, known as the Valve
Test Facility, will consist of several supply vessels and drain vessels

for containing molten salt at temperatures to 750°C, essential auxiliaries,
test stands on which the equipment will be mounted, a housing around each
test stand, and a common ventilation system. For testing, a valve will

be installed in the pipe between a supply vessel and a drain vessel,
Transfer of salt between the vessels will be effected by adjusting the
cover gas pressures. The vessels, piping, and valves will be heated
electrically and will be heavily insulated. Air cooling will be provided
for some of the tanks. The tests on the valves will include determination
of leakage rates under various conditions of temperature and pressure and
investigation of the effects of thermal transients and thermal cycling on

the valves. The facility will include the instrumentation and controls
necessary for operation of the equipment but no special instrumentation
for obtaining test data. Cover gas will be supplied from a system
common to several facilities and the off-gas will be discharged to a
common off-gas system. The valves used in the tests will be provided
by the valve development activity. Final testing of larger size valves
will be done in the Components Test Facility (10.13) and the molten-salt
test reactor mockup (see Section 13).

10.10.5 Task 9.7.1 Status of technology report
This task will involve a literature search and consultation with valve
manufacturers and LMFBR personnel to establish present state-of-the-art

for high temperature valves and operators as well as a detailed evalua-
tion of experience with freeze valves in the MSR Program.

10.10.6 Task 9.7.2 Define and perform development program

 

Based on the technology report, a detailed development program will be
outlined. Design and construction of the Valve Test Facility will be
completed, and work on valve development will be carried out. Two major
uncertainties related to valve development involve selection of the plug
and seat materials and design and development of high temperature oper-
ators. The fabrication of reliable bellows or some other hermetic stem
seal, such as the torque-tube seal, must be demonstrated. A commerical
capability for fabricating large Hastelloy valves would be developed.

10.11 TASK GROUP 9.8 CONTROL ROD DEVELOPMENT

Control rods that have been conceived for molten-salt breeder reactors
represent a marked departure from present technology. In one type, the
active section is of graphite, in another it is of metal. In both types,
the active section operates in highly radicactive fuel salt at temperatures
to 750°C, but the directly coupled rod drives must operate at temperatures
below about 200°C.

10.11.1 Objective

The objective of this task is to investigate and develop control rods
and control rod drives which meet the safety and other requirements for
the molten-salt test reactor. Efforts will be made to use a similar
design to that proposed for the molten-salt demonstration reactor in
order to reduce duplication of development effort.

 
SE

 

10-71

10.11.2 Schedule

The schedule for the development of control rods for MSR's is shown in
Table 10.11.2. A status of technology report and the conceptual design
of the Control Rod Test Facility will be completed in FY 1981. Final
design of the facility will be completed in FY 1982, and construction
of the facility will be completed during FY 1983. The major portion of
the development effort will be done in conjunction with the design of
the molten-salt test reactor which will begin in FY 1985.

10.11.3 Funding

Operating fund requirements for this task group are shown in Table
10.11.3. Capital equipment funds in the amount of $250,000 will be
required during FY 1982 for design and construction of the Control
Rod Test Facility.

10.11.4 Facilities

As noted earlier, the control rods proposed for the MSBR are markedly
different from present technology, and a facility will be required for
testing prototypes of MSR-type rods and drives in a simulated reactor
environment. No facility exists where such tests could be made, and it
will be necessary to construct a rod-test facility.

The Control Rod Test Facility will consist primarily of a rod test thimble,
a small molten-salt circulation system and essential auxiliary systems, a
test stand on which the equipment will be mounted, a housing around the
test stand and a ventilation system. The rod test thimble will simulate
the reactor vessel and upper shield structure. Molten salt will be re-
circulated through a rod channel formed by graphite pieces in the lower
section of the thimble. The rod will be moved in the rod channel by a
drive mounted in the upper shield section of the thimble. Appropriate
seals in the upper shield section will provide the necessary separation
between the environments of the rod and the drive. The reactor section

of the thimble and the salt circulation system will be heated electrically
and will be heavily insulated. A cooling system will be provided for the
upper shield section of the thimble. A drain tank will be provided for
the salt. Cover gas will be supplied from a system common to several
facilities, and the off-gas will be discharged to a common off-gas

system. An instrumentation and control system will be provided for the
test facility. The control rods and drives and their instrumentation

and controls will be provided by the control rod development activity.

10.11.5 Task 9.8.1 Define development program and construct test facility

 

Most of the work on development of control and safety rods will be directed
toward the needs for the molten-salt test reactor. The work in this task
will be concerned with preparing a status of technology report, defining

a control rod development program, and completing the design and construc-
tion of the Control Rod Test Facility.

There has been no experience with control rods operating directly in salt
and problems of physical arrangement, cooling and containment must be de-
veloped. Drive mechanisms developed for the LMFBR program possibly could
be adapted for use in the MSBR control drive system. The "roller nut"
concept as depicted by the Marvel Schebler drive by Borg Warner and the
"magnetic jack" drive by Westinghouse are possibilities which would be
considered because of the design and development already accomplished in
support of the LMFBR program.

10.11.6 Task 9.8.2 Perform development program

 

Most of the work in this task will be associated with development of the
drive mechanism and methods for guiding the rods. Shielding and contain-
ment will also be considered.

10.12 TASK GROUP 9.9 CONTAINMENT AND CELL HEATING

10.12.1 Objectives

The objective of this task group is to provide sufficient testing of
the proposed oven-type heating of the salt-containing systems to deter-—
mine the constraints which this approach places on maintenance, opera-
tion, and instrumentation selection, and to compare its economic impact
with that of other containment and equipment heating methods.

10.12.2 Schedule

As indicated on Table 10.12.2, the definition of the development pro-
gram is divided into two periods, one in FY 1980, and the other in FY
1984. The first period covering FY 1981 and 1982 is for obtaining basic
data needed for design. The work in FY 1985 is intended to test detailed
design of the primary containment for the molten-salt test reactor.

10.12.3 Funding

Operating fund requirements for this task group are given in Table
10.12.3. These figures, especially those shown in FY 1984 and 1985,
should be considered preliminary. Capital equipment funds in the
amount of $77,000 will be required during FY 1981.

Preliminary development of various items will be done on an individual
basis but the oven~type heating and containment system will be tested
in the molten-salt test reactor mockup (see Section 13).

10.12.5 Task 9.9.1 Define development program
Although the containment philosophy and the idea of using the cell as
an oven appears straight forward, these need to be studied carefully in

order to uncover any ucertainties and to define a program to resolve
these. The HTIGR experience will be fully utilizied.

10.12.6 Task 9.9.2 Perform development program

 

This task involves the accomplishment of the work outline above.

10.13 TASK GROUP 9.10 COMPONENTS TEST FACILITY

10.13.1 Objectives

The objective of this task group is to provide a location equipped with
the necessary services and utilities to permit development and testing

of large-scale reactor components and systems under design conditions

as well as unusual operating conditions. A 30-MW MSR steam generator
model will be tested which will produce steam at temperatures and pres-
sures proposed for the test reactor. Information will be obtained on
various items including the startup procedures, the overpressure pro-
tection system, and the steam-leak detection system. A prototype pump
will be tested to obtain information on factors including the flow
characteristics and the effects of temperature transients. Large-scale
valves, cold traps, core components, heat exchangers, tritium management
schemes, etc. will be tested under all conditions which are likely to be
encountered in an operating reactor. Development of some components will
be carried out concurrently in a single development facility, while others
will require individual facilities.

This work cannot be done in existing facilities, due to the large space
requirements. For instance, the steam generator model will be about
145-ft high, a 30-MW salt heater will be needed, and large cooling towers
will be required for a heat sink.

The CTF is intended primarily for the development and testing of compo-
nents associated with the test reactor. However, the facility design
will be such that it could be modified or expanded for use in additional
component development for a demonstration reactor.
10-76

Although some components to be tested in the Components Test Facility
will be full scale, additional prooftesting of all components will be
carried out in the molten-salt test reactor mockup. This system will
be a full-scale integrated facility having a configuration similar to
that of the molten-salt test reactor. However, it will operate iso-

thermally and only slow temperature transients will be possible.

10.13.2 Schedule

As indicated in Table 10.13.2, conceptual design of the Components
Test Facility begins in FY 1978 and construction will be complete by
FY 1982.

10.13.3 Funding

Operating fund requirements for this task group are shown in Table

10.313.3.1. Authorization of funds to cover the design and construction

of the CTF will be required in early FY 1980. A preliminary estimate

of the cost of the basic facility in which test systems would be located

is $10 million; however, no detailed design and cost analysis has been
carried out for obtaining this estimate. Capital equipment fund requirements
for this task group are shown in Table 10.13.3.2.

10.13.4 Facilities

The Components Test Facility will consist of a location that is suffi-
ciently large to house the Steam Generator Model Test Stand and the
Prototype Pump Test Stand, as well as individual test facilities for
large-scale components such as valves, control rods, and core components.
A large electrical power supply will be installed to operate pumps and
other equipment and to provide electrical heating for salt-containing
lines and components. A ventilation system will be provided with ade-
quate filtration and air cleanup to assure containment of hazardous
materials including beryllium-containing compounds and BF3. Cooling
water and other utilities will be installed; as well as general-purpose
modular instrumentation. Computer systems for recording and analyzing
data will also be included. An early activity associated with the con-
ceptual design of this facility will be to survey potential space for
housing the facility, and to complete the conceptual design of a building
if suitable space is not available.

10.13.5 Task 9.10.1 Conceptual design of the facility

In this task compilations will be made of all components and systems to
be tested, the type of test to be made, the utilities, salt requirements,
and other pertinent information in order to complete a conceptual design.
This facility will be used to test large-scale steam generators, pumps,
valves; heat exchangers, and other components. Adequate electrical supply

will be provided for operating large loops. Filtered exhaust systems,
overhead cranes, and modular instrumentation and heater controls will
be installed to accommodate various types of development.

This task consists of (1) establishing criteria for the CTF, (2) pre-
paring a safety analysis and environmental statement, (3) developing a
preliminary layout and design for the CTF, including instrumentation and
controls, (4) preparing a cost estimate for the project, and (5) prepar-
ing and submitting a long form construction project data sheet for FY
1980 authorization.

10.13.6 Task 9.10.2 Title I and Title II design of the facility

 

Title I design of the facility will begin after project authorization in
FY 1980 and Title II design will be completed during early 1981. Operat-
ing fund requirements during design of the facility cover personnel in-
cluding the program and project engineers, design work not covered by
capital project funds, estimating, and liaison between program and project
activities.

10.13.7. Task 9.10.3 Construction of the facility
Construction will begin in mid FY 1980 and will continue until late FY

1982. Operating funds are required for support of the program and
project engineers.

10.13.8 Task 9.10.4 Operation of the facility

 

Operation of the facility will begin in late FY 1982 and will continue
for an indefinite period. The initial activity will be associated with
the requirements for the MSTR, however, the later work will be in support
of subsequent reactor component development requirements.

11. MAINTENANCE

11.1 INTRODUCTION

The maintenance of all reactors requires the performance of various
mechanical operations on equipment which, because of radioactive con-
tamination and activation, is not directly accessible to maintenance
personnel. Depending upon the level of activity, the size of equipment,
and the design provisions for maintenance, anything from simple local
shielding to fully remote manipulation may be required. The time re-
quired to do maintenance and the cost of the maintenance provisicns
increase with the degree of remoteness required.

The circulating-fuel reactor has fission products and intense radiation
to contend with not only in the reactor vessel but also in all of the
primary circuit through which the fuel salt circulates, the off-gas
system, and in the fuel processing plant. Thus the circulating-fuel
reactor requires radicactive maintenance of a greater scope than does

a fixed-fuel reactor. On the other hand, the refueling operation is
simpler, the radioactivity is retained on-site within one containment,
and the necessity of a separate maintenance organization and equipment
for a fuel reprocessing plant at another site is avoided.

Although maintenance design efforts cannot affect the size and activity
level of the components in a reactor, much can be done in the design
stages of a plant to influence strongly the degree of accessibility and
the complexity of the maintenance operation. The maintenance concept
for an MSBR is characterized by the following general principles:

1. Each system is composed of manageable units joined by suitable
disconnects and lines which can be cut and rewelded remotely.

2. Each unit is accessible and replaceable from directly above
through removable shielding.

3. Failed units are removed and replaced.

Much of the maintenance experience on which this concept rests resulted
from application of this approach to the MSRE. Only the simplest of
inspections and repairs could be done on failed equipment for the MSRE;
however, in an MSBR economic considerations will dictate consideration
of more extensive repair capabilities.

11.1.1 Objective

The objectives of work in this activity are to develop the technology
required for maintaining those portions of an MSBR which require remote
or semiremote maintenance techniques, and to obtain improved estimates
of the impacts of maintenance on the economic and nuclear performance of
MSBRs. The work in this activity will interface strongly with that in
Reactor Design and Analysis (Section 8).

11.1.2 Scope
The scope of work in this activity consists of the consideration of a

remote maintenance requirements during the preliminary and conceptual
design of molten=-salt reactovs (including the 1000-MW(e) reference design
MSBR, a demonstration reactor, and a test reactor), the development of

 

the remote maintenance technology required by these reactors, and the “
development of equipment and techniques for remote inspection of welds.

Consideration of in-service inspection of all types alse falls within

the scope of this activity. ws

11.3 REQUIREMENTS, BACKGROUND, AND STATUS OF DEVELOPMENT

 

11.3.1 Technological background

 

During the past 15 to 20 years, the nuclear industry has acquired a great
deal of experience in the maintenance of radicactive systems. Some has
come from having to make repairs under very difficult conditions. A few
such jobs have necessitated undesirable exposure to personnel; others
have required ingenious devices and very long times to accomplish.
Although these feats have been instructive, they are not models to follow.
The goal in designing a reactor is not only to make maintenance possible,
but to make it as sure, as safe, and as economical as it can be. The
experience that points the way to this objective is that acquired with
those plants in which maintenance was planned, provided for, and un-
eventfully carried out despite high levels of radioactivity. There has
been experience of this sort in various USAEC installations, both with
reactors and with chemical processing plants, that provides a broad
technological basis for developing the maintenance system for an MSBR. Edie

11-3

At ORNL, four circulating-fuel reactors (ARE, HRE-1, HRE-2, and MSRE)
have been operated, as well as processing facilities of various kinds.
Although the level of radicactivity varied, they all contained complex
systems for circulating, processing, and storing radioactive materials
whose activity levels denied direct access. The need for maintenance
was recognized in advance, and maintenance provisions were made in
their design. Development programs also included maintenance planning
and practice. The preparations for maintenance of the MSRE, the orga-
nization, and the conduct of the maintenance operations actually
performed on the MSRE are described in reference 4 and the MSR Program
semiannual progress reports from 1967 through 1971.

11.3.1.1 Preparations for MSRE maintenance

 

Preparations for maintaining the MSRE began with the involvement of
maintenance specialists in the design, and continued through the con-
struction and startup phases.” The first scheme visualized for the
MSRE featured a bridge-mounted manipulator, operated in an enclosed
space above the reactor cell and controlled remotely with the aid of
television. (A maintenance development facility including a manipulator,
viewing devices, and equipment mockups had been used at ORNL toc show
the feasibility of this approach.) Smaller jobs in the MSRE were to be
done by the semi-remote technique proved in the HRE-2, using simple,
long-handled tools manipulated by hand through small penetrations in a
portable shield set up over an opening in the cell's concrete roof.
Design and planning soon showed that the maintenance work anticipated
in the MSRE could be done in this simpler way, and the manipulator idea
was set aside.

The MSRE portable maintenance shield was a set of tracks and several
12-in.-thick steel slabs, with holes for tools and viewing devices, that
rolled on the tracks. Inserts for the holes included shielding windows,
lights, and split bushings to fit around tool shafts. When very free
tool movement was required, bags of steel shot around the shaft blocked
the radiation. Lifting devices permitted the remotely controlled
building crane to remove shield blocks or major equipment items. Each
removable item had a bail at the center of gravity or other provisions
to simplify lifting. Guides were provided where necessary to steer
replacement parts into place. To ensure proper fit, jigs were built for
all of the major replaceable components. The 5-in. salt lines were
provided with flanges that used frozen salt as a barrier to keep molten
salt away from the ring gasket. Machines were developed (and fixtures
installed in the cell for them) that could cut the 1-1/2-in. lines to
the drain tanks, prepare the ends, bring old and new pieces together,
and join them by brazing. The only tools required for most operations
were simple, long-handled hooks, wrenches, and clamps characterized by
their reliability rather than by their versatility.

During the installation of the reactor equipment and the prepower test-
ing, many of the maintenance provisions were tested. All of the primary
loop was assembled on a large jig before going into the cell and optical

tooling was used to locate reference points in the cell precisely.
Maintenance items that were tested included the crane, lifting and
viewing devices, and the various types of disconnects. Freeze flanges
were opened and closed; a cell-space cooler, the control rods, rod
drives and a core-sample array were removed and replaced; the primary
heat exchanger and fuel pump bowl were installed using in part the
remote maintenance provisions. After the nuclear startup experiments
the fuel pump rotary element was removed, inspected and reinstalled.
During this time personnel were trained and procedures were perfected.

11.3.1.2 Extent of MSRE experience

 

The semi-remcte jobs that were accomplished in the reactor and drain tank
cells during the 4-1/2 years of nuclear operation are summarized in Table
11.3.1.2. With the exception of those carried out in 1965 (before high-
power operation), all of the jobs involved components that were lccated in
radiation fields of several thousand R/hr. The radioactivity of the items
that were removed varied widely; some, such as the specimens that were
removed from the core 5 to 7 days after shutdown, read several hundred
R/hr at several feet. All of the jobs involved use of the remote-
maintenance control room, at least for setting up and removing the
maintenance shield. The cell-top membrane was cut, welded, and inspected
each time maintenance was done.

In addition to the maintenance in the reactor and drain-tank cells,
there were several jobs involving highly radicactive components in other
parts of the building. Valves and filters in the off-gas system were
removed and replaced, and heaters were installed on the inlets of the
off-gas charcoal beds. The fuel-sampler drive mechanism had to be
repaired on several occasions, which required that a temporary wood-and-
plastic containment enclosure be set up inside the reactor building.

The post-operation examinations carried out between November 1970 and
February 1971 involved viewing in the core and in the fuel pump, cutting
out several parts of the fuel salt system, and plugging some lines.

The general technique was the same as was used in maintaining the reactor:
long~handled tools through the maintenance shield. Some of the tools
were quite different, however, to handle the special tasks.

The control rods and drives were removed, the 10-in. core-access plug
with the rod thimbles was taken out, and a section of rod thimble was
cut off with a grinding wheel. A grinding wheel, mounted on a special
tool, was alsc used to cut through the pump tank around the sampler cage
so that it could be removed. An 1ll-in. section of the heat exchanger
shell was cut out with a plasma torch, then sections of six tubes were
cut with an abrasive cutoff tool and removed for inspection. Examination
showed that, as suspected, a small amount of salt (v2 in.3?) had leaked
near a freeze valve in a drain line. The freeze valve and adjacent
piping was cut out and removed. The holes in the pump tank and the heat
exchanger shell were patched, the latter by welding, and plugs were
installed in the severed ends of the drain lines.

11.3.1.3 Significance of MSRE maintenance experience

 

Although the major components of the fuel system, whose replacement would
have been more complicated than any job that was done, required no main-
tenance, the MSRE experience was sufficient to thoroughly test the gemeral
maintenance strategy and many of the specific design features.

The MSRE maintenance system was reliable: no job arose that could not
be done. An important factor was the flexibility of the maintenance
system which allowed obstacles to be circumvented and unforeseen jobs
(such as those in the off-gas system} to be accomplished.

The experience with the MSRE emphasized that the payoff for preparation
is tremendous in the case of radioactive maintenance. Jobs such as
replacing the core specimens went very quickly compared to others that
were basically less difficult, but for which no special provisions had
been made.

Especially valuable information on fission-product contamination came
from the MSRE experience. Noble gases behaved predictably and could be
purged before systems were opened. Salt-seeking fission products were

no problem — the salt drained cleanly and any that was trapped froze and
retained the fission products. There was no corrosion film or scale to
flake off and become airborne. At least part of the noble metals that
deposited on surfaces in the off-gas system were fairly easily transfer-
rable, but particulate contamination was generally confined to the tools,
which were swabbed znd bagged as they were pulled from the shield.

Iodine that was produced by the decay of tellurium on surfaces soon
appeared in the air in the reactor cell. Ventilation air from the re-
actor building and from the containment cells was passed through partic-
ulate filters and up a stack. The greatest amount of activity discharged
in any week was less than 0.2 Ci (mostly iodine) and occurred during work
on the off-gas system.

Although radiation levels in the reactor cell were typically om the
order of several thousand R/hr while maintenance work was going on, the
general background to which workers were exposed while manipulating
tools was only about 0.01 R/hr. Procedures were planned to minimize
personnel exposure in locally higher radiation fields and the work was
never seriously inconvenienced by having to rotate workers. No main-
tenance worker ever received more than the normal limit of 3 rem in any
quarter.

11.3.2 MSBR maintenance requirements

 

In designing and planning for the maintenance of the MSBR, the experi-
ence with the MSRE and other radioactive systems has been evaluated and
adapted to the extent possible. The maintenance system for the reference
MSBR is discussed in some detail in ORNL~4541.°

 

 

 
11-11

11.3.2.1 Classes of maintenance

 

MSBR maintenance requirements fit into the following four general classes.

Class I — Permanent Equipment. This category contains all items
which can reasonably be expected to require no maintenance during
the design lifetime of the plant. Examples are the reactor vessel,
the pump vessels, primary heat exchanger shells, the fuel=-salt
drain tank, thermal shielding, thermal insulation, the connecting
EE process piping, etc. No special provisions are included for main-
tenance of these items. Emergency maintenance to some extent is
possible, however, because of the access that is provided primarily
for in-service inspection.

 

Class II — Equipment Allowing Direct Maintenance. This group
includes the items which can normally be approached for direct
maintenance within a reasonable period of time (typically after

the secondary salt has been drained and flushed and the remaining
activities allowed to decay for about ten days). The steam gener-
wa ators, reheaters, coolant-salt pumps, and the equipment in the heat
rejection cell fall into this class. In the unlikely event that
one of these components did become highly contaminated with fission
products, its removal would be treated as a Class III or IV item,
discussed below. Once the sources of activity were removed from
the cell, cleanup and component replacement could proceed in the
normal fashion using direct maintenance.

 

Class III — Equipment Requiring Semidirect Maintenance. Much of

the equipment in the off-gas and chemical processing cells, such
is as pumps, blowers, valves, processing vessels, filters, etc., will
become radioactive. In general, the sizes of these items are com-
parable to the MSRE equipment. MSBR radiation levels may be a
factor of 10 higher than in the MSRE, however. The maintenance
tools for this class of equipment could be similar to those for
the MSRE, but the shielding and containment provisions would

have to be more effective because of the more intense sources
a of radiation.

Class IV — Large Equipment Requiring Remote Maintenance. This
FE group includes items which are clearly beyond present experience
because of a combination of size, radiation level, afterheat
removal, and disposal considerations. Examples are the pump
rotary element, the primary heat exchanger tube bundle, and the
core graphite.

 

 

The reactor primary system, because of the large size of the

Ha highly contaminated equipment, presents the greatest problems in
containing the radicactivity and dealing with afterheat and is
therefore used as the basis for the discussion which follows.

 
11-12

11.3.2.2 Containment considerations

 

Although the fuel salt and highly radioactive gases will be removed

from any system before it is opened for maintenance, the reactor primary
system will still contain large amounts of radioactivity, some of which
will be transferable. The MSBR building and cells and the maintenance
equipment and procedures must, therefore, be designed so as to limit

the spread of radioactive material within the reactor building and to
prevent more than trivial amounts from being released outside the
building during maintenance.

The fission-product decay heating and the amounts of short-lived activity
that must be dealt with decrease rapidly during the first few days after
cessation of power operation. For this reason, it is unlikely that the
primary system will be opened sooner than ten days after full-power
operation is stopped.

Ten days after shutdown from sustained operation at 2250 MW(t), the
noble-metal fission products on surfaces may total about 2.2 x 108 curies,
or roughly 3 x 10° Ci per ft2 of metal surface that had been exposed to
the fuel salt. (This figure is based on the assumption that 75% of the
noble metals deposit on metal surfaces in the loop.) The deposited
tellurium will be generating iodine, some of which will go into the gas
or air contacting the surface. At 10° sec (11.6 days) the calculated
total rate at which 2.3-hr 1321 is generated from 78-hr Te on surfaces is
2 x 10% ci/hr or about 30 Ci/hr per ft? of surface in the fuel circulating
system. Eight-day 1311 will be generated on surfaces at a total rate

of about 5 Ci/hr or 7 x 1075 Ci/hr per ft2.

The noble gases in the graphite after 10 days could amount to as much
as 1.2 x 10% Ci (almost all 13330), assuming none diffused out during
the cooling period. The radioactive daughters of ncble gases in the
graphite would likely range up to 1 x 107 Ci.

The inventories of the fission products that dominate at 10 days after
shutdown may be as much as 170 times those in the MSRE. (This factor
may be considerably lower if the MSBR gas-stripping system removes a
substantial fraction of the noble metals.) The amounts per unit area
should be less than 5 times as great as in the MSRE, however.® Thus
the observed behavior of the deposited fission products in the MSRE
should be rather similar to that to be expected in the MSBR.

*For the shortlived noble metals that are dominant a few days after
shutdown, the intensity on fuel loop surfaces is nearly proportional to
the ratio of power to loop surface area. For the reference MSBR, this
is 2.25 x 108/5.2 x 10% = 43 kW/ft?; for the MSRE the ratio was 7.4 x 103/
8.5 x 102 = § kW/ft?,
 

 

11-13

Based on the MSRE experience, we expect that the noble metals on surfaces
will be more or less adherent, depending on whether they are on surfaces
in the salt loop or in the off-gas system, but that care must be used

to avoid knocking or scraping them off. Although there was uncertainty
in the fraction of the surface-generated iodine that was released into
the gas in the MSRE, it is clear that in the MSBR measures must be pro-
vided that are adequate to deal with all of the iodine so generated.

The noble-gas daughters in the graphite will not be readily transferable,
and should cause no contamination problem.

The MSBR building and equipment layout are intended to permit safe con-
tainment of the radioactivity during maintenance. Before maintenance
is started, the fuel salt will be secured in the drain tank. (Normally
it will be circulated for several days te help remove afterheat before
it is drained.) The system requiring maintenance will then be purged
of radioactive gases and, if necessary, cooled down. The containment
cell will then be unsealed and a maintenance shield set up. The cell
will be maintained at a slight negative pressure by an air exhaust
system. Tools and other items penetrating the maintenance shield will
be sealed to the shield so as to minimize air leakage into the cell.
(Boots or gas-buffered seals might be used.) Primary systems will

not be left open to the cell longer than necessary; if an equipment
item cannot be replaced immediately a temporary closure will be applied
in order to minimize both the radicactive contamination of the cell and
the ingress of oxygen and moisture into the system. When contaminated
items are removed through the shield, they will be withdrawn into casks
through openings equipped with valves or flanges that will close the
reactor cell and the cask except during the transfer. Generally, the
gas streams passing through the cell will be filtered, passed through
absorbers and recirculated. Any excess gas will be stripped of radio-
activity before it is discharged to the atmosphere. Items removed from
the primary system will be repaired or prepared for disposal in a hot
cell where similar precautions must be observed. All operations will
be carried out inside the reactor building to assure complete containment.

The assurance of public protection during maintenance is comparable to
that during operation, although the lines of defense are different.
During operation, the fuel salt and highly radioactive gases are circu-
lating within the vessels and piping, which are in turn doubly contained,
being inside sealed cells inside the reactor building. During mainte-
nance, the fuel salt with most of the fission products will be sealed

in the drain tank, and the precautions that ensure that it will not be
brought out during the maintenance operations constitute primary contain-
ment for it. Any system to be opened will be drained and purged so that
when it is finally opened, the amount of radioactivity that could con-
ceivably escape into the cell will be far less than that circulating

(and liable to being spilled through a pipe rupture in the design-basis
accident) during operation. The first line of defense ("primary contain-
ment") for this limited amount of radioactivity is the ventilation system
that maintains the cells at a negative pressure and removes any radio-
active contaminants from the exhaust stream before it is discharged into
the reactor building. Secondary containment during maintenance is the
same as during operation — the sealed reactor building.
11-14

11.3.2.3 Afterheat considerations

 

The fission products that will remain in the graphite and on surfaces

in the fuel system will produce significant heating in the large equip-
ment items while maintenance operations are going on. This must be
taken into account in the provisions for the major operations: replace-
ment of the core graphite, the tube bundle of a primary heat exchanger,
and perhaps the rotary element of a primary pump.

it is estimated that 10° seconds (11.6 days) after shutdown from 2250
MW(t) the total heat generation rate in the primary system would be 770
kW, consisting of 210 kW in the graphite of the core, 125 kW in each of
the four primary heat exchangers, and 60 kW distributed over the other
surfaces. What the temperature in the primary system must be before it
is opened has not been determined. With the cell cooling system that
is envisioned, the fuel system temperature 10 days after a shutdown
would likely be in the range of 500 to 100CG°F. If further study of the
maintenance procedures indicates that this would be unacceptable, addi-
tional heat removal must be provided, additional time allowed to reach
a satisfactory temperature, or more likely, local cooling would be
employed to lower the temperatue at the point of critical operations to
200 to 400°F. Some cooling must be continued while the item is being
removed, but the rate of temperature rise in the absence of cooling
would be low — 30°F/hr for a heat exchanger bundle and 2.4°F/hr for the
graphite core. The temperatures of the piping and rotary element of
the pump would rise even more slowly.

11.3.2.4 Graphite replacement

 

Because of neutron irradiation damage, it will be necessary to replace
the core graphite several times during the life of an MSBR plant. Con-
sideration of the effects on breeding and possibly on power distribution
leads to removal of the graphite while it is still structurally sound.
Thus, although the removal procedure must be capable of dealing with
broken graphite elements, the strength of the graphite should not

hamper its removal.

In the ORNL reference MSBR,® the upper head of the reactor vessel and
the entire core (176 toms of graphite and 97 tons of metal) are replaced
as a unit. This constitutes by far the largest maintenance task in

this conceptual design, and explains some important features of the
building layout and equipment. The major item of special maintenance
equipment required for the core replacement is a 20-ft-diam x 40-ft-high
shielded transport cask. The carbon steel walls of the cask are about

2 in. thick, which is sufficient to reduce the radiation level on con-
tact with the outside of the cask to about 1000 R/hr and at the outside
wall of the reactor containment vessel to less than 0.1 R/hr after'a
10-day decay period for the core. Conservative estimates indicate that
the 210 kW of heat being generated in the core can be safely dissipated
through the cask wall so that no cooling system for the cask will be
required. The reactor core assembly is prepared for removal in a

 
[22)

 

 

11-15

semidirect fashion through a work shield. The lifting of the core
assembly into the transport cask and transport to the spent—-core
storage cell, the installation of the new core assembly, and the re-
placement of the shielding are accomplished from the remote maintenance
control recom in the same fashion as the removal and replacement of
large items of MSRE equipment.

Ebasce Services and their associates in an industrial design study
carried out under subcontract to ORNL questioned the desirability and
practicality of replacing the core graphite as a unit. They investigated
making the core of individually replaceable elements, and decided that
15-in. hexagonal elements were the optimum. ’ Some of the graphite
elements would be replaced at 4-year intervals, during major turbine-
generator overhauls. Adoption of this scheme would obviously greatly
alter the requirements for handling tools and casks for the exposed
graphite; however, additional work is necessary for demonstrating the
feasibility of this approach.

11.3.3 Status of development work

 

As stated earlier, the MSBR maintenance concept depends upon access from
above, a system of replaceable units, appropriate disconnects and tools
to operate them, and lines which can be cut and rewelded remotely. Thus,
it is clearly essential that maintenance design and development be con-
current with plant design. This has been the case in the conceptual
studies to date. The maintenance techniques for fluid-fuel reactors have
evolved as the size, complexity, and radiation levels of the reactors
have increased. Design studies have not indicated any insurmountable
problem in maintaining a 1000-MW(e) MSBR, and no serious conflicts have
arisen in imposing the maintenance requirements on the reactor system,

Most of the techniques and many of the tools have been developed.
Several flexible maintenance shields have been built and used. Optical
viewing equipment — window inserts, periscopes, adequate lighting — all
are available. The use of a shielded maintenance control room with
windows, remotely-operable TV, and remotely-controlled crane and tooling
has been successfully demonstrated. Remotely-operable disconnects for
electrical power, instrumentation, and service piping are at a satisfac-
tory state of development. The remote fabrication of brazed joints in
small system piping has been demonstrated in connection with the MSRE.Z

Two important techniques that are requisites for maintaining large power
reactors are not available, however. They are remote welding and post-
maintenance inspection.

It is highly desirable from the standpoint of reliability that the MSBR
fuel circulation system be of all-welded construction. Thus, remote
cutting and rewelding of the system piping will be required in the
replacement of major components. The status of remote welding as of
1969 and the required development program were presented in reference 8.
11-16

A portion of that program has been accomplished and the present generation
of automatic welding machines are reliable and capable of masking high-
quality welds.? These machines are not now capable of fully remote
welding, but appear to be adaptable to this purpose.

The provisions in the MSBR for access to equipment for maintenance
operations are equally applicable to in-service inspection. The state-
of-the-art of remote inspection of welded joints is reviewed in reference
10. Dependable application of common methods for nondestructive inspec—
tion of welds is difficult or impossible in high-temperature, high-
radiation fields. Some methods promise to be successful, however, and
current AEC and industrial programs are developing equipment, manipula-—
tors, and interpretive methods for acoustic emission and ultrasonic
holography monitoring and inspection. These programs are expected to
culminate in remote inspection methods for reactor welds which should

be adaptable to MSBR conditions and needs. The equipment and techniques
for remote repair do not exist; however, much of that development as
well as the inspection development is interchangeable with remote
welding development.

11.4 TASK GROUP 10.1 CONSIDERATIONS OF REMOTE MAINTENANCE DURING
PRELIMINARY AND CONCEPTUAL DESIGN

It is highly important that remote maintenance be given adequate consid-
eration during the preliminary and conceptual design stages for molten-
salt reactors in order that (1) the required maintenance technology can
be identified, (2) provisions for remote maintenance requirements can

be properly incorporated in the design of reactors and components, and

(3) improved estimates of the cost of remote maintenance can be developed.

11.4.1 Objective

The objectives of work in this task group are to develop a maintenance
approach that is consistent with the overall design objectives for the
MSBR, and to identify the required maintenance technology which will
allow reliable remcte maintenance of MSBR's at an acceptable cost.

11.4.4 Task 10.1.1 Remote maintenance for 1000-MW(e) reference design
MSBR

 

Although many aspects of remote maintenance development for a 1000-MW({e)
MSBR must be carried out during the final stages of design for a parti-
cular reactor, a number of important factors must be considered during
the preliminary and conceptual design stages in order that a consistent
approach can be adopted for demonstration and test reactors, and in order
that the required maintenance technology can be identified and developed
in a timely manner. Work in this task will consist of a general survey
of MSBR maintenance needs during the preliminary conceptual design stage,
identification of maintenance requirements for individual components as
the conceptual design for the reference MSBR is defined sufficiently,
determination of the required remote and semiremote maintenance func-
tions, definition of restrictions on the reference design which result
from maintenance requirements, and evaluation of the impacts of mainte-
nance on the economic and nuclear performance of the reference design
MSBR.

11.4.4.1 Subtask 10.1.1.1 General survey of MSBR maintenance needs

Work in this subtask will consist of a review of previous werk on remote
maintenance for MSBRs and an extension of previous work as necessary to
provide a general description of maintenance requirements for MSBRs.
Many aspects of current MSBR reference design are sufficiently complete
for work in this subtask, and the remaining aspects will have been defined
by the end of FY 1978 (see Section 8). The maximum temperatures and
radiation intensities under which the various maintenance operations
would be carried out will be identified. The work will also determine
which components are to be replaced and which will be repaired in place.
The extent of primary-circuit cell cooldown necessary for the various
maintenance operations will be defined, and an overall maintenance
philosophy will be developed. The work will also determine where inter-
connects and maintenance-related pipe cuts and welds will be made.

11.4.4.2 Subtask 10.1.1.2 Maintenance requirements for individual
components

Work in this subtask will determine the probable maintenance requirements
for individual components for the reference design MSBR. Remote main-
tenance techniques will be developed for each component including methods
for in-service inspection, breaking of component disconnects and optimum
location of pipe cuts, methods for component support and transport during
maintenance, techniques for component inspection in order to determine
whether repair or disposal of a component will be effected, methods for
precise positioning of each replacement component, techniques for making
up disconnects, and methods for remote pipe welding and weld inspection.
11-20

11.4.4.3 Subtask 10.1.1.3 Determination of required maintenance
functions

Based on work described in Subtasks 10.1.1.1 and 10.1.1.2, a determination
will be made of the probable maintenance functions which will be required
for remotely maintaining an MSBR, and of the likely conditions, including
temperature and radiation level, under which these functions must be
carried out. The aim of this subtask will be to categorize maintenance
functions in a manner which shows clearly not only the type of function
but the range of variables which must be considered such as pipe diameter,
wall thickness, allowable work space, degree of visibility, etc.

11.4.4.4 Subtask 10.1.1.4 Determination of design restrictions
resulting from maintenance requirements

Work in this subtask will determine the design restrictions which are
necessary for the reference design MSBR as a result of maintenance re-
quirements and will identify any locations where maintenance considera-
tions dictate modification of the reference design.

11.4.4.5 Subtask 10.1.1.5 Estimation of impacts of maintenance
on economic and nuclear performance of 1000-MW{(e) MSBR

Work in this subtask will be aimed at obtaining an improved estimate of
the impacts ¢f remote maintenance on the economic and nuclear performance
of the reference design 1000-MW(e) MSBR. If maintenance operations are
identified which result in unacceptable nuclear or economic impacts,
alternate maintenance approaches and design changes will be evaluated.

11.4.3 Task 10.1.2 Remote maintenance for demonstration reactor

 

As discussed in Section 8 (Subtask 7.1.1.7), after the reference design
for the 1000-MW(e) MSBR has been sufficiently well defined, a preliminary
conceptual design will be prepared for a demonstration reactor which will
ultimately provide the experience necessary for design of commercial
reactors. Work will be carried out in this task during development of
the preliminary conceptual design for the demonstration reactor to ensure
that the additional maintenance technology, if any, required for the
demonstration reactor is identified, and to ensure that the maintenance
approach for the demonstration reactor will resemble as closely as is
practical that for the reference design MSBR. The general approach to

be followed in this task will be similar to that outlined in Subtasks
16.1.2.1 through 10.1.2.4. However, since the conceptual design for the
demonstration reactor will not be investigated as fully as the 1000-MW(e)
MSBR reference design, there will be a corresponding reduction in the
extent to which remote maintenance considerations are developed for the
demonstration reactor.

11-21

11.4.6 Task 10.1.3 Remote maintenance for test reactor

 

As discussed in Section 8 (Tasks 7.1.3 and 7.1.4), after the conceptual
designs for the 1000-MW(e) reference design MSBR and a demonstration
reactor have been defined sufficiently, a conceptual design will be
developed for a test reactor which would provide the technology required
for design of the demonstration reactor. Work in this task will consist
of determining the maintenance requirements for the test reactor and for
the individual components that will constitute the test reactor, deter-
mination of the required remote and semiremote maintenance functions,
and definition of restrictions on the test reactor design which result
from maintenance requirements. An important function of this task will
be the identification of any critical maintenance technology required
for design of the demonstration reactor which will not be provided by
the test reactor.

11.4.6.1 Subtask 10.1.3.1 Determination of MSTR maintenance requirements

 

Work in this subtask will be aimed at determining the maintenance require-
ments for the test reactor, retaining to the extent practical the mainte-
nance approach and techniques required for the demonstration reactor and
the 1000-MW(e) reference design MSBR. The maximum temperatures and
radiation intensities under which the maintenance operations will be
carried out will be identified. The work will define the probable mainte-
nance requirements for the individual components of the test reactor.
Remote maintenance techniques will be developed for each component in-
cluding methods for in-service inspection, breaking of component dis-
connects and optimum location of pipe cuts, methods for component support
and transport during maintenance, methods for precise positioning of each
replacement component, techniques for making up disconnects, and methods
for remote pipe welding and weld inspection.

11.4.6.2 Subtask 10.1.3.2 Determination of required maintenance
functions

 

The work discussed in Subtask 10.1.3.1 will serve as the basis for de-
fining the probable maintenance functions for the test reactor, and the
conditions under which the maintenance operations will be carried out.
The maintenance functions will be categorized in order to show clearly
the types of maintenance functions required, and the range of maintenance
parameters which must be covered. The resulting requirements will be
compared with those established for the demonstration reactor and the
1000-MW(e) reference design MSBR in order to identify those requirements,
if any, which fall outside the previously established requirements. A
composite list of maintenance functions including the required ranges

of maintenance-related parameters will be developed which will serve as
the basis for development of MSR maintenance technology.
11-22

11.5 TASK GROUP 10.2 DEVELOPMENT OF REMOTE MAINTENANCE TECHNOLOGY

In molten-salt reactor systems, maintenance of components of the primary
circuit will be effected by using remotely operated tools and equipment.
System components, such as pumps, heat exchangers, and valves will be
replaced by remotely breaking disconnects and cutting pipe connections,
replacing the component, remaking disconnects and making remote pipe
welds, and inspecting the welds by remote techniques.

Remote maintenance requires suitable equipment for viewing and inspection
of equipment and systems at temperatures in the range cof 500 te 1000°F

in the presence of radiation levels of about 10° R/hr. Local cooling

can probably be employed te lower the temperature te 200 to 400°F. The
main steps in remote replacement of components will be cutting pipe
connections and breaking disconnects, spreading the pipe ends to provide
clearance for component removal, and transporting the component from the
cell. Installation of a new or repaired component will involve the steps
of maintaining cleanliness control, transporting the replacement component
to its in-cell location, aligning the component and pipe ends for welding,
tack welding the pipe ends to maintain alignment during final closure
welding, and remotely inspecting the weld to ensure that quality and
reliability standards have been met,

Many maintenance operations will be undertaken as a consequence of incip-
ient failure detection during operation or in-service inspection, and the
detection of incipient failures is a part of this task group. In some
situations, in situ repair may be preferred over component removal and
replacement.

11.5.1 Objective

The objective of work in this task group is the development of technology
required for remote maintenance of molten-salt reactors as identified

by work in Subtask 10.1.3.2, and by subsequent experience on the design,
fabrication, and cperation of components and systems for molten-salt
reactors.

11.5.3 Funding

Operating fund requirements for this task group are shown in Table
11.5.3.1, and capital equipment fund requirements are shown in Table

required in FY 1978 for the design and construction of a Maintenance
Development Facility.

require development of methods and equipment for remote maintenance of
the highly radioactive reactor primary and auxiliary systems. A facility
will be required in which the methods and equipment can be tested on
mock-ups of reactor systems. No facility presently exists in which such ws
tests could be made.

A Maintenance Development Facility will be constructed which will consist ws
initially of a mock-up of parts of a reactor cell and an auxiliary equip-
ment cell, mock-ups of parts of typical reactor and auxiliary equipment
and piping systems, some automatic cutting, welding, and positioning
equipment and equipment necessary for handling remote maintenance tools.
This facility will be installed in an existing building. Initially, the
work in the facility will be concerned with adapting the automatic cutting,
welding, and positioning equipment for remote operation and demonstrating a
those operations on a simulated reactor system. As designs are evolved

for reactor equipment, models of the equipment will be installed in the

cells, and methods for maintaining the equipment will be tested and wi
improved. It is anticipated that much of the reacter maintenance will
have to be done at temperatures of 200 to 300°C and with special venti-
lation. Part of the facility will be equipped for conducting maintenance

tests at elevated temperatures. This activity will require obligation es
of $200,000 in capital equipment funds during FY 1978.
Subsequent development work on remote maintenance techniques for a molten- di

salt test reactor will be carried out in the molten-salt test reactor
mockup (see Section 13).

11.5.5 Task 10.2.1 Development of improved viewing devices

Work in this task will be concerned with the development of improved = %
viewing devices for remote maintenance applications. The use of mirrors
has been beneficial in many applications, and commercially available
periscopes, ocmniscopes, telescopes, and fiber optics equipment have been i
used for a variety of needs in nominal-radiation and high-temperature

environments associated with reactor repair and hot cell work.

The application of fiber optics devices to observations in areas where

access limitations or obstructions prevent the use of conventional viewing

equipment is relatively new, and work in this task group will consist

of a survey of fiber optics applications and availability in order to a
identify potential applications of such devices to remote maintenance

operations, and to recommend additional work in areas of promise.

Werk in this task group will alse include a survey of radiation and
high-temperature-resistant television equipment, and procurement and
testing of equipment which appears suitable in order to evaluate the
need for additional development work in this area.

11.5.6 Task 10.2.2 Development of remote pipe cutting equipment

Considerable experience has been developed at ORNL on the development

and use of automated, orbital pipe cutting machinery as part of a feasi-
bility study for the MSR maintenance program. Machining heads were shown
to be capable of cutting pipe, trimming the ends square, and preparing
end bevels on schedule 40 stainless steel pipe in sizes up to 6 in.

with little difficulty. Problems arose in cutting Inconel because of its
work-hardening tendencies, which are similar to those of Hastelloy N.
Additional difficulties are anticipated for pipe sizes larger than 6 in.
since the cutting operations are slow, cutter feed rates are minimal,

and cutters dull rapidly and require frequent replacement. Observations
indicated that the carriage drive is the limiting factor on cutting
ability. Improvements are required to provide a stronger and more
positive cutter depth control and more stable longitudinal adjustments.

A split-bearing sleeve carriage was proposed for development which could
be installed remotely and used for in-cell pipe cutting.

Commercially available pipe cutting equipment appears to be adaptable

to remote pipe cutting; however, conventional equipment requires consid-
erably greater clearance than equipment developed by ORNL. Currently,
work is underway at the Hanford Engineering Development Laboratory for
development of equipment for remotely cutting and welding of the open-
and closed-loop reactor top closures for removal and reinstallation of
experimental assemblies. The equipment, which is applicable to relatively
small (6.72-in. mean diam) pipe, is being tested at temperatures as high
as 500°F and is designed to withstand exposure to 10° R/hr gamma radia-
tion. It is anticipated that work in this task will benefit greatly
from this work as well as from advances in commercial pipe cutting
equipment.

Work in this task will be directed toward further evaluation and develop-
ment of improved carriages including the split-sleeve type. Particular
attention will be given to the effect of pipe spring back during the
cutting operation which may result in damage to the sleeve end bearings.
Work will alsc be carried out for surveying commercially available
equipment and adapting equipment having potential.

11.5.7 Task 10.2.3 Development of seal weld cutting and welding
equipment

Work in this task will be directed to the development of techniques and
equipment for the remote cutting and welding of seal welds. New types
of carriages and weld-head propulsion schemes will be developed for seal
weld applications.
11-28

11.5.8 Task 10.2.4 Development of preweld cleaning techniques

   

Final preweld pipe-end preparations include kerf and/or chip removal
from the open ends of the pipe joint, removal of salt from the pipe wall,
and the installation of a suitable purge block plug into the pipe near
the open joint. Acceptable environmental, off-gas airlock, and venti-
lation conditions must be established within the cell. Cutting chips
from mechanical sawing, kerf from plasma flame cutting, and salt residue
on the pipe walls adjacent to the cut joint must be removed before the
installation of purge blocks or the taking of a facsimile in preparation
for final pipe welding.

Work in this task will be directed to the development of preweld cleaning
techniques and equipment, and to development of methods for the proper
introduction of replacement components. Existing tools and equipment
will be modified when possible to provide the necessary cleaning action.

11.5.9 Task 10.2.5 Development of pipe spreading and alignment
equipment

 

There is only limited experience with the use of remotely controlled
equipment for spreading the ends of pipe after cutting, positioning
replacement components in proper alignment, and holding them in position
during welding. Most of the available reactor maintenance experience
relates to underwater maintenance, whereas MSBR maintenance must be
performed under dry conditions. The limited dry maintenance experience
results from work with the MSRE mockup and with MSRE maintenance; how-
ever, work is currently underway on other reactor concepts which should
be applicable in part to MSBR maintenance requirements. Techniques for
pipe alignment were partially developed as part of the Westinghouse
Pennsylvania Power and Light Company study for the Pennsylvania
Advanced Reactor Program (PAR) during the late 1950's.

Work in this task would determine pipe flexibility requirements and de-
fine the extent to which pipe sizes, wall thickness, length, and method
of attachment influence flexibility. In a tightly coupled system, such
as the reference design 1000-MW{e) MSBR, flexibility is limited and it
may be necessary to use tailored spool pieces for joining short sections
of large diameter pipe. An analysis will be made of all in-cell pipe
systems for anticipated pipe deflection shifts and movements when pipes
are severed during maintenance operations. The equipment and pipe support
devices required for maintaining alignment, the locations of the cut
planes, and the space required for insertion of pressure cylinders for
moving the pipe ends will be defined. The potential of split-bearing
sleeves for realigning pipe for preweld and weld tacking assembly will
be evaluated, and devices of this type will be developed if warranted.

11.5.10 Task 10.2.6 Development of remote pipe welding techniques

 

Work in this task will be directed toward the development of remote pipe
welding techniques for MSBR maintenance. There are currently a number
of commercially available automatic welding devices, as well as an ORNL-
developed automatic welder which will automatically butt-weld pipes from
3 to 6 in. in diameter having wall thicknesses ranging from 3/16 to

1.5 in. The resulting welds have been shown to meet ASME codes and RDT
standards for nuclear-quality gas--tungsten-arc welding of pipe.
Presently, the commercial machines must be mounted on pipes manually,
and operator judgment is necessary for achieving satisfactory operation.

Work in this task will consist of surveying the commercially available
automatic welding devices, procuring one or more devices which show the
greatest potential for adaptation to remote maintenance welding appli-
cations, and carrying out remote welding tests under simulated remote
maintenance conditions. Particular attention will be given to modifica-
tions necessary for ensuring adequate resistance to temperatures in the
range of 300 to 500°F and gamma radiation levels as high as 10° R/hr.

11.6.5 Task 10.3.1 Interpretation of automatic welder records

It appears possible to interpret the data that is recorded during the
remote automatic welding of pipe in order to determine the likelihood

of a flaw in each weld pass. It is known that excessive arc voltage and
low current will cause lack of weld penetration; low arc voltage and high
current, or low wire feed and high weld current will cause melt-through;
and irregular carriage and weld speeds will result in uneven bead depth
and contour.

Work in this task will be directed to determining the extent to which
data recorded during remote welding can be interpreted and relied upon
for determining the likelihood and location of a weld defect. The
feasibility of incorporating this type of weld inspection technique in
codes covering remote-pipe welding will be determined, and further work
will be carried out if warranted.

11.6.6 Task 10.3.2 Adaptation of customary methods of nondestructive
examination of welds

 

Maintenance and repair of MSBR components by remote welding will require
techniques for nondestructive examination to ensure the integrity of
welds. It is likely that the inspection techniques will have to be
suitable for use at temperatures in the range of 500 to 700°F and in the
presence of gamma radiation levels as high as 10° R/hr. If necessary,
it is probable that the temperature at the point of weld inspection
could be lowered to 200 to 400°F by local cecoling. Work im this task
group will be aimed at adapting customary methods of nondestructive
examination of welds to use at the conditions outlined above in cases
where this is feasible.

11.6.6.1 Subtask 10.3.2.1 Liquid penetrant examination

Liquid penetrants containing visible or fluorescent dyes are used routinely
for detecting surface-connected flaws in welds. However, commonly used
materials will not be applicable at the high temperatures anticipated

for MSBR maintenance. Products currently under development show promise
for use at temperatures as high as 600 to 900°F; however, little data is
available on the sensitivity of such products to surface connected flaws.

Work in this subtask will be aimed at surveying commercially available
penetrant examination materials that have potential for high temperature
application, and for determining the sensitivity and suitability of the
products for MSBR maintenance applications.
11-34

11.6.6.2 Subtask 10.3.2.2 Radiographic examination

 

Radiography is a primary means for examination and acceptance of welds.
The high gamma radiation levels and high temperatures which will be
associated with MSBR maintenance appear to rule cut the use of conven-
tional radiography because of the sensitivity of x-ray film to gamma
radiation. A potential alternative radiography method uses neutrons as
the penetrating radiation, and detection methods which are not sensitive
to gamma radiation. It is possible that with improved neutron sources
(e.g., 252¢f), acceptable techniques can be developed for inspection of
remotely welded joints.

Work in this subtask will be directed to evaluating the feasibility of
using neutron radiography techniques for remote inspection of welds in
MSBR systems, and to preparing a plan for effecting the required develop-
ment work necessary for use of this technique if this is justified.

11.6.6.3 Subtask 10.3.2.3 Ultrasonic examination

 

Ultrasonic examination methods have been used increasingly during recent
vears for weld inspection because of the ability of this technique to
detect discontinuities such as cracks and lack of fusion. The mechanical
convenience of ultrasonic probes and their minimal sensitivity to high
levels of radiation have led to their use in a number of reactor and
hot-cell applications. While welds have been examined successfully with
a number of materials, difficulty is encountered in the application of
ultrasonic techniques to nickel-base alloys and stainless steels because
of variable attenuation of sound and the presence of grain boundary
reflections. Additional work is also needed on the development of
improved methods for coupling ultrasound from the transducer into the
weldment.

Work in this subtask will be directed toward determining the feasibility
of and potential for using ultrasonic techniques for remote inspection
of welds in MSBER systems, and toward developing plans for work required
for use of this technique if this appears to be justified.

11.6.7 Task 10.3.3 Development of advanced methods for nondestructive
examination of welds

 

 

Because of the difficulties foreseen in applying conventional methods

for nondestructive remote inspection of welds, work will be carried out
in this task for evaluating the potential of advanced examination methods
including eddy current examination and acoustic emission techniques.

11.6.7.1 Subtask 10.3.3.1 Eddy current examination

 

Methods based on electromagnetic induction of eddy currents have been
utilized for detecting flaws, measuring materials properties, and deter-
mining the space between adjacent components. Application of this tech-
nique to the inspection of welds has been quite limited because spurious
signals result from variations in coil-to-specimen spacing such as might
result from roughness of a weld bead. Recent advances in eddy current
theory and modeling as well as instrumentation suggest that eddy current
examination may have potential for remote inspection of welds and deter-
mination of pipe joint spacing prior to tack welding. The extent to which
eddy currents penetrate a metal is limited; however, it is possible that
eddy current techniques could be developed sufficiently for consideration
as a replacement for liquid penetrant examination techniques.

Work in this subtask will be aimed toward determining the feasibility

of eddy current examination techniques for remote maintenance inspection
of welds in MSBR systems, and toward defining the development work
required for application of eddy current techniques if this appears
justified.

11.6.7.2 Subtask 10.3.3.2 Acoustic emission techniques

 

The previously discussed nondestructive examination techniques are used
to determine the as-fabricated condition of a weld after the welding
operation has been completed. Each is an active technique in that matter
or energy is applied to the weld in order to determine its condition.
The acoustic emission technique is a passive methed in which detectors
are used for monitoring the sonic energy released within the weld as it
is completed produced by actions such as crack formation or propagation.
Recent data indicate that acoustic emission techniques have promise for
detection of flaws during remote welding operations. The transducer
materials required for this technique would likely withstand short term
exposure to high temperature and gamma radiation, and coupling of the
transducers to the weldment would be simpler since the transducer would
not be required to traverse the weld area. If acoustic emission signals
were observed, supplementary examinations using other weld inspection
techniques would be necessary for determining the location of a flaw.

12, INSTRUMENTATION AND CONTROLS DEVELOPMENT

12.1 INTRODUCTION

A significant effort in the development of MSR's will be devoted to the
study of methods for controlling the reactor systems during startup, part
load, full load, and under upset conditions to allow proper assessment

of the operational and safety implications of various control approaches.
While it appears that instrumentation and control systems for MSR's are
relatively straightforward, a number of features inherent in this reactor
type dictate further development of the technology associated with control
methods and systems.

12.1.1 Objective

The general objective of this activity is the development of technology
necessary for the design of instrumentation and control systems required
for the safe and efficient operation of molten-salt reactors. Specifi-
cally, the objectives include (1) the development of computer programs
required for transient representation of MSR systems operating under
various control modes, (2) the analysis of control systems having promise
for molten-salt reactors, (3) the characterization of power, pressure,
and temperature transients and levels in MSR systems under normal and
upset conditions for the more promising control metheds, and (4) the
identification and development of instrumentation required for control
of MSR's.

12.1.2 Scope

The scope of this activity will be restricted initially to demonstrating
that satisfactory control methods can be devised for the various oper-
ational modes necessary for molten-salt reactors, and the identification
and development of instrumentation required for utilization of control
methods having the greatest potential. The work will be concentrated
primarily on the requirements for a 1000-MW(e) MSBR in order to identify
technology areas requiring further development and demonstration before
and during operation of molten-salt test and demonstration reactors.
Studies will be carried out as necessary for characterizing transients
which may occur during normal and accident conditions with the preferred
control methods in order that these conditions can be considered properly
during the development of components and materials for the various reactor
systems.

As the designs progress for molten-salt test and demonstration reactors,
more detailed attention will be given to the control requirements for
these reactors.

12.1.2.1 Task Group 11.1 Control analyses

 

The work in this task group will be directed toward developing computer
representations of MSR plant operation under a variety of conditions,
developing and analyzing various contrcl methods, determining the re-
quirements for meaningful flux measurements in MSR's, characterizing
pressure and temperature transients for various operating modes, spec-
ifying the requirements of special instrumentation and control devices
such as a salt throttling valve for partially by-passing the secondary
coolant around the primary heat exchangers, further evaluating the need
for fast scram capability in MSR systems, and determining the need for
instrumentation in MSBR processing systems. The modeling and analysis
of plant transient behavior will be coordinated with similar efforts
associated with safety studies (see Section 7) to ensure optimum utili-
zation of analytical and computing capabilities.

12.1.2.2 Task Group 11.2 Instrumentation development

The work in this task group will be directed toward developing high tem
perature flux sensors capable of operation at 1000°F and higher with the
high reliability required for reactor control systems; the development

of improved instrumentation allowing direct measurements of pressure,
flow, and level in molten-salt systems; and the assessment of the avail-
ability of instrumentation for MSR's and the need for additional develcp-
ment and adaption.

12.3 REQUIREMENTS, BACKGROUND, AND STATUS OF DEVELOPMENT

The control system requirements of an MSBR are basically the same as
those of other power reactors; however, a number of features which are
peculiar to this reactor concept affect the instrumentation and control
systems.

In the reference MSBR design, the entire primary salt system is located
in a primary containment that is maintained at about 1000°F. This
arrangement makes it unnecessary to insulate the pipes and vessels and
removes from the reactor cell a multitude of electrical cables, thermo-
couples, disconnects, and containment penetrations that would be required
for heaters located directly on the pipes and vessels. Some connectors
and signal transmission lines must either be designed to operate properly
in such an environment or must be located in penetrations that are cooled
reliably.

The high freezing points of the MSBR fuel and coolant salts impose rather
stringent control and protection system requirements. Care must be ex-—
ercised to prevent freezing of the salt in auxiliary lines, as well as

in main salt lines and heat exchangers. ! The filling and startup proce-
dures, although simplified by the oven concept, will be somewhat complex,
as will be the procedure for admitting feedwater into the steam-generator
system. Reliable instrumentation must be provided for determining the
condition of the salt when it is outside the reactor vessel as well as
within.

The effects of fuel circulation on the effective delayed neutron fraction
must be considered in designing for transient conditions involving pri-
mary system flow changes. These effects are well understood, and expe-
rience in the design and operation of circulating fuel reactors gives
confidence that this feature will not cause any particular problem.

Fission products in the primary circulating loop present the usual
problems of handling radioactive fluids. The presence of these highly
radioactive loops also has a potential for increasing background signals
in nuclear instrumentation. Replacement of instrument sensors and inter-
connecting signal lines will in some cases require remote maintenance
techniques.

The reference MSBR is designed to have a core differential temperature
of 250°F. As in other reactors operating with a large AT, means must be
provided to limit thermal stresses during abnormal operational events.

The MSBR does not require that a large amount of excess reactivity be
available. The ability to adjust fuel concentration during operation
and the reduction of !3%Xe poisoning by gas stripping reduce two of the
largest reactivity requirements of other types of plants. Total control
reactivity required for operation will probably be on the order of 1%
§k/k. This small amount of excess reactivity greatly reduces the poten-
tial for large reactivity excursions, thus easing requirements on safety

rods. The ability to drain the fuel away from the moderator into a
noncritical configuration is a very important feature of the molten salt
reactor concept. The intent is not to use the fuel drain for fast shut-
down but to assure long-term shutdown margin under unusual circumstances,
hence fast-acting drain valves are not required.

12.3.1 Requirements and current concepts

12.3.1.1 Systems for normal operation

 

Normal operation of an MSBR includes all phases of startup from celd or
hot standby conditions, production of electric power at demand loads
between 20 and 100% of design capability, and scheduled shutdown. The
contrel systems must allow for the different requirements for the various
operating modes and establish and maintain safe and appropriate operating
conditions. The systems must coordinate the operation of the reactor,
the primary- and secondary-salt loops, the steam generators, and system
auxiliaries. In general, load demand is the primary signal to which the
control subsystems must respond. However, while matching the power
generation with the load, the control system must also maintain system
temperatures and their rates of change within acceptable limits. Specific
areas of concern are the temperature in the salt loops, and the salt
temperatures which must be maintained well above the freezing point
throughout the circulating systems (with the possible exception of some
areas in the steam generator).

The present concept is to control the nuclear power level by graphite

rods which are used in an automatic control loop to maintain reactor
temperature at a set pecint programmed according to the needs of the steam
system. This arrangement is a variation of a scheme successfully demon-
strated on the MSRE, where the temperature set peint was defined by the
operator. In such a control system, the reactor power is determined by
the load, with a temperature base line independently determined to provide
steam at the desired temperature.

Maneuvering from one power level to another requires control of steam
temperature during the transient. The current concept invelves auto-
matic control of secondary salt flow rate through the steam generator

in order to take advantage of the thermal capacity of the salt while the
reactor power level is being readjusted to the new requirement.

In a multiloop plant, such as the reference MSBR, the control system
must adequately respond to loop interactions. The most satisfactory
approach appears to be one in which each loop is controlled as a wmic to
produce a specified amount of steam under well-defined conditions, with
the balancing of the loops being controlled by a master programmer —
perhaps a digital computer — that is responsive to the needs of the power
grid. This programmer would adjust set points on appropriate closed-loop
controllers associated with the coolant loops.

.12.3.1.2 Emergency systems

In addition to providing normal control functions, the instrumentation
and control system must provide protection against a variety of anomalous
or accident conditions. Although the entire control system should con-
tribute to safe and orderly operations, there will be a system dedicated
entirely to protection of personnel and to the prevention of major
equipment damage. This latter system, the plant protection system (PPS),
includes monitoring instrumentation to detect off-normal conditions,
logic subsystems to make decisions and initiate corrective actioms,
actuators to effect system control actions, and post—accident monitoring
systems.

The plant protection system must be capable of shutting down the plant
when necessary and carrying out other protective functions, such as
ensuring that systems are in order for containing the radioactivity in
the event of a major accident and the removal of afterheat following an
emergency shutdown where normal cooling is impaired.

Whereas the control rods will be graphite partially inserted into the
core so that positive and negative reactivity changes can be made, the
safety rods will be neutron-absorbing poison rods of considerably more
reactivity worth. Because of their effect on neutron economy and
breeding, the safety rods would normally be withdrawn out of the active
core region. However, continuous adjustment of their position should
be possible to facilitate recovery from off-normal conditions.

It is not clear at this time that a fast "scram" capability will be
required. The prompt negative temperature coefficient of the fuel plus
the significant thermal capacity of the salt and graphite are factors
which make the plant less sensitive to reactivity excursions. However,
detailed analyses of a particular plant design will be necessary to
establish the precise requirements of the PPS.

12.3.1.3 Instrumentation

The operational control systems and the plant protection system will
require extensive instrumentation to provide input to the automatic
decision-making process of control. Measurements of neutron flux levels,
as well as of the nonnuclear variables such as flow rates, pressures,
temperatures, etc., will be vital to effective control of the plant.
Some instrument sensors and signal transmission lines, and possibly some
containment penetrations will be required to operate reliably in hostile
environments of high temperature, high radiation levels, or both. The
high residual radicactivity in the reactor cell will make direct mainte-
nance impossible in many locations, and accessibility of instrument
components for remote disconnect and replacement will be necessary.
12-8

In general, conventional electronic or pneumatic signal conditioning
equipment can meet the needs of the MSBR. However, the size and com-
plexity of the plant will make it highly desirable to use digital computer
techniques for multiplexing, data storage and retrieval, calculation,
and other functions. Optimization of the plant output will require
development of sophisticated control schemes. A high degree of auto-
mation and supervisory control will be necessary im the MSBR, as in any
large multiloop plant, because of the large number of interacting
processes. Use of automatic control loops for a large number of system
control functions is commonplace; however, the integration of these into
effective system control is often left to the operator. Significant
improvements in operation can be achieved if overall system control is
highly automated using well-established techniques.

12.3.2 Experience with the MSRE and other facilities

 

A large number of out-of-pile and in-pile loops and other facilities
have been operated with molten salt at ORNL over the past 20 years which
have had instrumentation and control systems of varying degrees of com-
plexity. In addition, ORNL and others have operated high-temperature
systems containing molten metals or gases, and a number of reactors of
these types have been operated in the U.S. and abroad. Although these
have provided experience in instrumentation that is applicable to MSR's,
the most direct and useful information has come from the operation of
the MSRE.?

Successful operation of hundreds of thermocouples attached to the salt
system walls in the MSRE gives confidence that reliable temperature
measurements can be made at the elevated temperatures of moltem-salt
reactor systems. Although there was considerable scatter in the readings
of the couples under different heaters when the salt was actually iso-
thermal, techniques of biasing the outputs were used to provide thoroughly
acceptable measurements.> The importance of careful selection and cali-
bration, details of fabrication and installation, and strict quality
control was evident, in that only 12 of the 330 thermocouples failed
during five years of operation.

Pressure and differential pressure measurements in the coolant salt
systems were made using NaK-filled transmitters. No direct measurement
of salt pressure was made in the primary system, where gas pressure
measurements were used to infer salt-system pressure. Direct measure-
ments are desirable in an MSBR, and additional development may be
required for such applications.

The measurement of salt flow rate in the secondary system was made by
means of a venturi and a NaK-filled differential pressure transmitter.
No direct measurement was made of flow in the primary system. Inasmuch
as the reactor was operated with constant primary-salt flow rate, no
particular problem existed in normal operation. As part of the plant
protection system instrumentation, pump motor current was measured.

 

 
SE

 

12-9

Though not a precise indication of flow, this measurement plus pump speed
gave adequate assurance of flow. That is, the pump motor current would
be less than normal even though the speed was normal if for some reason
the salt flow was reduced. Direct measurement of the flow in the primary
systemr would be desirable for a power reactor, especially if variable
flow is used.

Level measurements were made with single-point probes as well as bubblers
and float level systems. These operated very well over the life of the
plant, but each has limitations which may necessitate additional develop-
ment for application to MSBR service.

Containment penetration cable seals were difficult and costly to install,
and their performance was marginal .? In the furnace concept of the MSBR
it will be desirable to locate the seals in thermally insulated areas.

In addition to valuable experience in instrumenting molten-salt systems,
the MSRE gave an opportunity to verify methods of analysis of the dynamics
of circulating-fuel reactors. The operation with 2337 was particularly
interesting because of the unusually small effective delayed neutron
fraction (Bers = 0.0019). Analyses and tests made prior to loading
into the MSRE gave confidence that the system would be well behaved with
regard to stability and controllability .%s° Results of tests performed
after loading were in good agreement with the predictions.®

233g

The MSRE rod controller was designed to make the reactor cperate in a
load-following, or reactor-slave-to-load, mode in the power range. In
this mode the operator selected the desired temperature of the salt
leaving the reactor core, and the steady-state reactor power was deter-—
mined by the rate at which heat was rejected by the air-cooled heat
exchanger in the secondary salt system. From an experimental viewpoint
this allowed easy automatic control of temperature and power level, with
practically no interaction between them. For a power reactor this scheme
has the potential for controlling steam temperature independently of power
level. The control system used on the MSRE met the specific requirements
of that reactor and encourages the use of such a controller as part of
the overall MSBR plant control system.

The digital data collecting and computing system for the MSRE was used
extensively with excellent results. The overally availability after an
initial debugging period was over 95%.7 The system proved invaluable
for the timely and economic collecting, logging, and analyzing of experi-
mental data generated by the MSRE. In addition, it was used to provide
operator guidance through the standard printout of signals in the form
of routine periodic logs, alarm signal printout, routine calculations
such as heat balance and reactivity balance, and operator-demanded func-
tions and calculations. It was used extensively for the control and
instrumentation of reactor dynamic tests, such as frequency response and
temperature response experiments, ® for retrieving and processing data
previously stored on magnetic tapes for analysis, and toc provide infor-
mation relative to the time, cause, and effect of abnormal operating
12-10

events. Programs were developed to aid in calibration of analog systems
and in diagnosis of troubles. A program was developed for a fast Fourier
transform which was programmed to run on line in background time and
which was used routinely for on-line analysis of neutron fluctuation
data. By use of this program it was possible to monitor the bubble
fraction in the fuel salt.?>10

The overall experience with the computer system was excellent and demon-
strated the tremendous value of such a system in a complex plant. A
comprehensive data collecting and computing system for an MSBR is con-
sidered to be indispensable.

The MSRE experience is valuable in demonstrating that most of the unique
instrumentation and control problems associated with circulating fuel
reactors are amenable to solution with familiar techniques. Those
problems which were not solved or which were circumvented due to limited
time or funds will be easier to resolve for MSBR applications by the
insight gained from MSRE operation.

12.3.3 Status of control analyses

 

Preliminary studies of startup, standby, and shutdown procedures have
been carried out for the reference design MSBR, although only to the
point of determining feasibility. In making these analyses, several
basic restraints on operation of the plant were recognized. The freezing
temperatures of the primary and secondary salts are such that the salt
systems must be filled and salt circulated isothermally at 1000°F before
power withdrawal can be initiated by decreasing the coolant-salt temper-
ature. To avoid freezing of the salt and to prevent excessive temperature
gradients, the minimum feedwater or steam temperature to the steam
generators for the reference design system must vary between 1000°F at
zero load and 700°F in the 8 to 100% power range. In addition, the
afterheat load in the reactor system, which decays slowly, may require
that the feed water and heat rejection systems remain in operation
following shutdown of the main steam system.

Most of the special systems and equipment needed to handle the startup

and shutdown conditions in an MSBR station are associated with the steam-
power system.!l The requirements impose some departure from the equiv-
alent systems used in conventional fossil-fired supercritical-pressure
steam plants and will require further study. Different steam generator
designs, for example reentrant or concentric-tube types, would not require
heating the feedwater as hot as 700°F, and would alter the steam plant
arrangement. An auxiliary boiler is necessary for startup from the cold
condition.

12.3.3.1 Computer models

The dynamics and control studies of MSBR plants have been concentrated
about the normal operating power range, and a series of studies has been
made to examine these operating characteristics. ?°!3 The studies have
been implemented with analog and hybrid computer simulations of the plant
characteristics.l»15 All of the simulations have been patterned after
the MSBR reference design, ! but the nature of the models is such that
they would have general applicability. For the purpose of these analyses
the MSBR plant consisted of a simplified graphite-moderated, circulating~
fuel reactor, a shell-and~-tube heat exchanger for transferring the gener-
ated heat to a secondary ccolant salt, a shell~and-tube supercritical
steam generator, and several possible control systems.

Due to the very nonlinear nature of the once~through steam generator,
it was necessary to develop a highly detailed model of this part of the
system. In order to approximate overall plant performance, the earlier
models used lumped-parameter, log-mean—differential-temperature analog
simulation of the steam generator, although the accuracy was known to be
severely limited. At the same time, a hybrid digital-analog model was
developed and used initially to examine the stability of the steam
generator.l® The hybrid model of the steam generator was combined with
an analog representation of the other plant components, resulting in an
overall simulation in which considerable confidence could be placed.
Representative transient responses using this model are described in
Reference 15.

The general validity of the all-analog models was confirmed, although,
as expected, some disagreement in absolute values was observed. The
trends indicated in the analog studies are correct, but the magnitude
and rates of change of variables during transients should be used only
as general guides.

The hybrid model was used to study control schemes and normal plant
maneuvering. Some more severe transients were examined to determine
system response to abnormal situations. The severity of the transients
that could be run on the hybrid simulation model was, however, limited
by the steam generator model, which used 0.5-second calculational time
steps. Consequently, it will be necessary to improve the accuracy with
which the steam generator can be represented (probably using a digital
computer) in order to study more severe transients and complement the
plant safety analysis.

12.3.3.2 Analysis of steady-state conditions

The first step in the formulation of a control system to enable the plant
to undergo changes in load was to determine the steady part-locad temper-
ature and flow profiles for operation between 20 and 100% of full load.
For initial considerations it was desirable to fix or predetermine the
steady-state values of some variables for part-load operation. Turbine
12-12

limitations require that the turbine throttle temperature be held nearly
constant (1000°F for the cases studied), and the feedwater temperature

was held constant as well (700°F). The primary salt flow rate was as-
sumed constant at design point for steady-state considerations. With
these limitations imposed, it was found that the secondary-salt temper-
ature at the steam generator outlet could not be held above the salt
freezing point at part loads below about 507%. Thus methods must be
developed which allow more effective decoupling of load effects on salt
temperatures. Some possibilities are: (1) allowing the steam temperature
to increase above the 1000°F design point as the load decreases, with
subsequent attemperation of the steam with injected feedwater; (2) in-
creasing the feedwater temperature above the 700°F design point as the
load decreases; (3) reducing the number of steam generators in use as

load decreases; and (4) using a salt throttling valve to bypass some of
the secondary-salt flow around the primary heat exchanger to reduce the
temperature of the salt entering the steam generator. Steam attemperation
and secondary salt bypass were the subject of additional steady-state
analysis of the plant concept. Either scheme or a combination of the

two appears to permit the establishment of acceptable part-load operating
conditions.

12.3.3.3 Apalysis of transient behavior

 

The models described have been used for transient analysis of the plant
and proposed control schemes. The power operating range for a typical
plant is expected to range from approximately 20% to 100% of full design
load. Throughout this load range the steam temperature to the turbine
throttle must be held essentially constant, the primary-and secondary-
salt temperatures and flow rates must be kept within acceptable limits,
and the resulting stresses due to induced thermal gradients must remain
within acceptable ranges.

A master load programmer may be needed to divide the required load demand
among the multiple coolant loops and steam generators. It should be
possible to operate the plant at partial loads by operating some loops

at 100% capacity while other loops deliver no power. The control studies
have shown that stable plant load control may be accomplished using two
basic control loops: a steam temperature controller and a reactor outlet
temperature controller. To achieve close control of steam temperature
during load transients it is necessary to vary the secondary-salt flow
rate in the steam generator. An additional control subsystem may be
necessary if a salt bypass valve is used in order to maintain the desired
coolant salt temperatures. The reactor outlet temperature controller
examined was similar to that used successfully on the MSRE.!7

A load demand signal determines the reactor outlet temperature set point.
The measured reactor inlet temperature is subtracted from the reactor
outlet temperature set point, and since the primary-salt flow rate is
constant, a reactor power set point is generated by multiplying this AT
by a proportionality constant. The measured value of reactor power (from
neutron flux) is compared with the reactor power set point, and any error

 
 

 

 

12-13

is fed to the control rod servo for appropriate reactivity adjustment.

The reactor power set point, generated from the outlet temperature, is

a function of the reactor inlet temperature during a transient and thus
a function of dynamic load.

There are certainly other possible control schemes for achieving satis-
factory plant performance. Analog simulations have shown that an inte-
grated control scheme is essential to good performance. If excessive
thermal stresses are produced by the transients that accompany load
changes, they can be reduced by varying the primary salt flow rate as a
function of load.

The small isothermal temperature coefficient of reactivity implies that
only modest amounts of control reactivity are needed to accomplish plant
load maneuvering. For the reference design, a typical maneuver from 50%
to 100% power at a rate of 57%/min required 0.05% 8k/k and a rate of
0.0001%/sec 8k/k. The maximum system temperature rate of change for this
transient was about 0.3°F/sec at the reactor outlet.

12.3.3.4 Accident analyses

The most likely abnormal power excursions would result from sudden changes
in load demand or rapid changes in salt flow rate in either the primary

or secondary system, as a result of pump or power failure. A few limited
cases of this type have been examined on the hybrid simulation. Some
less~likely reactivity anomalies were alsc briefly examined on the hybrid
model. Conceivable reactivity changes may result from primary flow vari-
ation, fuel addition accidents, core geometry changes, or failure of one
or more control rods.

A reactor shutdown or protection system must be coordinated with the

salt circulation loops and the steam plant. If the load is suddenly
lost, the reactor power generation must be reduced to avoid overheating.
Similarily, if the reactor is shut down the steam load must be quickly
reduced to avoid subcooling or freezing of the salt. Similar situations
arise due to salt circulation pump failure. For example, if primary

flow is lost, followed by an appropriate reduction in load demand and
reactor power, the primary salt could still freeze in the heat exchangers
because of the increased residence time unless secondary flow is alsc
reduced.

The plant emergency procedures clearly will be somewhat complex because
of the high salt freezing temperatures, and a careful analysis will be
needed to derive satisfactory solutions.

12.3.3.5 Reactivity control

Long-term reactivity adjustments are expected to be accomplished by
varying the fuel concentration. Normal regulating and shimming funtiomns
for load following and shutdown are within the calculated capabilities
12-14

of a system containing a few graphite rods, as proposed for the reference
design.l®

Some events may be anticipated that would require additional negative
reactivity or reactivity rates beyond the capability of the graphite

rods alone. Poison rods could be used to provide this additional
reactivity control and to provide substantial shutdown margin. However,
having poison rods in the core during normal operation is undesirable
because of their adverse effect on breeding. The poison rods will prob-
ably be held outside of the core poised for rapid shutdown if needed.
They may alsc be used for additional shimming during core loading or for
other operations or abnormalities but the exposure at power will be short
.and the effect on breeding and rod life will be small. We do not presently
anticipate that extremely fast insertion, or "scram" of the rods will be
necessary, although reliable insertion must be assured.

12.3.4 Status of instrumentation development

12.3.4.1 High-temperature flux sensors

 

In the reference MSBR, the entire reactor cell will operate at about
1000°F. Thus any nuclear detectors which are located in this space must
be capable of operating at such high temperature or else they must be
cooled. If in-core detectors are required the service conditions will
be even more severe. No detectors are presently available for operation
above 9G0°F, and even for the higher temperatures only special develop-
mental models exist. Similar problems exist in the liquid metal fast
breeder reactor program, and development work is being done. It may be
possible to locate ionization chambers in specially cooled wells or
thimbles located outside the reactor vessel. For use in the reactor
protection systems, such chamber wells would have to be designed with
the same performance reliability as required of the protection system,
since failure of the cooling systems would bring about failure of the
detectors.

Neutron fluctuation analysis proved to be a valuable tool for monitoring
anomalous behavior in the MSRE.9:!0 Unfortunately, one of the require-
ments for obtaining good results with this technique is a high detection
efficiency for core-coupled neutrons. While no detailed calculations
have been made of neutron fluxes outside the reflector and vessel, it

is possible that in the MSBR these fluxes will be too low to provide

the desired signal-to-noise ratio for some types of fluctuation analysis.

A411 of the proposed nuclear detector locations are within the high-
temperature primary containment oven and have in common the problem of
containment penetration seals. Generally, the specifications for pene-
trations for nuclear detectors are more demanding that those for process
sensors because of the typically very small signal currents delivered.
The location and detailed requirements of these penetrations have not
yet been determined, but the need for some development work in this area
 

 

 

12-15

is anticipated. The signal transmitting lines will require special design
and some development because of the high-temperature environment.

12.3.4.2 Plant instrumentation

 

Although MSBR system instrumentation can reasonably be expected to require
some designs beyond the present state of the art, no problems are foreseen
that could not be resolved by further development of components and
techniques.2519 Many instrument components used successfully in the MSRE
and others being developed for the LMFBR will be directly applicable to
the MSBR. Similarly, experience being gained by the utilities industry
with instrumentation of supercritical pressure steam systems will be
applicable to the MSBK.

MSBR process instrumentation located outside the biologically shielded
areas and not an integral part of the containment system can be conven-
tional equipment. Some standard components, however, may require up-
grading, and a strict quality control program will be required to ensure

a level of reliability and performance commensurate with MSBR requirements.

All process instrumentation components located within the containment

cells or as an integral part of the containment system probably should be
considered developmental. These components are predominantly primary
sensing elements for measurement of flow rates, pressures, levels, weights,
and temperatures in the salt-containing pipes and vessels, in the associ-
ated purge and off-gas systems, and in the salt chemical processing
facilities. Other such components are final control elements (such as
off-gas control valves), lead-wire and piping connections to the sensing
and final control elements, remotely operated disconnects, and containment
penetration seals.

The electrical conductivity of the MSBR salts will be a factor in selecting
the type of primary sensing elements than can be used. The conductivities
of MSBR salts are estimated tc be about 1 mho/cm — about the same as MSRE
salts. This means, for example, that magnetic flowmeters probably cannot
be used, and most of the devices will be similar to those used on the

MSRE.

Some development will be required toc adapt MSRE control components to
the higher pressures and temperatures that will exist in portions of the
MSBR. Development of other equipment and techniques, such as electrical
penetrations into salt-containing pipes and vessels, would undoubtedly
lead to improved instrumentation.

12.3.4.3 Salt throttling valves
One of the more promising plant control schemes depends upon throttling

in a secondary salt bypass around the primary heat exchanger. (Tight
shut-off is not required of the valve in this bypass.) The maximum and
12-16

minimum flow rates and the rate of change of flow rate necessary tc achieve
satisfactory plant control will need to be factored into the development
of a valve for this service.

12.3.4.4 Digital computer application for contrcl and data handiing

 

The reference design includes the reactor, four primary loops, four
secondary loops, each having four reheaters and four steam generators,
and a multi-stage turbine. All of the loops interact or require respon-
sive action from other loops when perturbed, and the correct action to
take may not be simply perceived. Computer control and surveillance of
the plant is desirable tc relieve the operators of difficult tasks and
can be expected to improve the safety and reliability of operation.
Design planning should include from the beginning provisions for optimum
utilization of computer techniques.

12.3.4.,5 Chemical plant instrumentation and control

 

The instrumentation requirements of a full-scale chemical processing plant
have received only minimal attention from instrument designers. The
processes involved have been instrumented and controlled on laboratory

or pilot plant scales, but not with the volumes and radiation levels
expected in the full-scale plant. Early evaluation of potential problems
is needed to enable initiation of required development on a timely basis.

12.4 TASK GROUP 11,1 CONTRCL ANALYSES

The work in this task group is concerned with the analysis and development
of control systems required for MSBR operation under startup, standby,
part load, full load, shutdown, and accident conditions in a 1000-MW(e)
MSBR; and the characterization of MSBR operation with control systems
showing the greatest potential.

12.4.1 Objective

The objective of this task group is to develop the necessary technology
required for design of control systems for a 1000-MW(e) MSBR, and to
identify the operating characteristics of the reactor system in sufficient
detail to guide Program activities in areas including the development and
testing of materials, development of high temperature design methods and
data, safety analyses, and component development.

12.4.3,

12.4.4 Task 11.1.1 Computer representation of plant operation

 

The work in this task will be directed toward the development of improved
computer representations of the MSBR primary, secondary, and steam systems
and the control systems which influence their operation. Analog and
hybrid computer simulations along with digital computer representations
will be extended or developed as necessary toc allow dynamic and control
studies required for characterizing the operation of an MSBR under a
variety of operating conditions. It is believed that analog modeling

can be used to advantage when determining general system behavior, how-
ever, digital representations will be required for the more complex and
detailed calculations necessary for final evaluation and study of reactor
plant operations. The computer representations thus developed will be
sufficiently general to allow study of alternate control methods and
systems, and will be sufficiently detailed that meaningful characteriza~
tions of reactor plant operation can be obtained for the purposes of
specification of operating transients for component design studies,
determination of materials requirements and probable service conditions,
and some accident analysis work.

12.4.5 Task 11.1.2 Development of control methods

 

Studies will be carried out using the computer representations of MSBR
systems developed in Task 11.1.1 to identify and investigate various con-
trol methods which adequately decouple load effects and temperature levels.
Both steady state and transient conditions will be examined. The studies
will be carried out initially in sufficient detail to demonstrate the
feasibility of one or more control methods, and systems showing the
greatest potential will be investigated in greater detail. Control
methods which will be considered include: (1) allowing the steam tem-
perature to increase above the 1000°F design point as the load decreases,
with subsequent attemperation of the steam with injected feed water;

(2) increasing the feed water temperature above its 700°F design point

as the load decreases; (3) reducing the number of steam generators in
operation as the load decreases; and (4) by-passing some of the secondary
salt around the primary heat exchanger to reduce the temperature of the
secondary salt entering the steam generators.

12.4.6 Task 11.1.3 Flux measurement analyses

 

The work in this task will be directed toward determining the accuracy
with which core-coupled flux measurements can be made in an MSBR and to
defining the extent and type of information which can be obtained through
analysis of neutron fluctuation data. Particular attention will be given

to use of this approach for obtaining long-term reactivity measurements.
Sufficient work will be carried out to determine whether out-of-core
measurements will suffice, and to determine the characteristics of an
acceptable measurement system.

12.4.7 Task 11.1.4 Calculation of pressure and temperature transients a

 

The work in this task will be directed toward calculating the pressure

and temperature transients at a number of critical locations in the su
vessels and piping during a full load, part load, changing load, and
accident conditions for the more promising control methods in order to
help guide the development of technology related to materials development
and evaluation, development of high temperature design methods and data,
component design and testing, and safety analyses.

12.4.8 Task 11.1.5 Determination of requirements for salt throttling
valves

 

The work in this task will be directed toward characterizing the require-
ments for salt throttling valves which are employed in one of the more
promising plant control schemes. The maximum and minimum flow rates and
the rate of change of flow rate necessary to achieve plant control will
be determined, and other characteristics of the valves determined as
necessary.

 

 

12.4.9 Task 11.1.6 Development of methods for inventory accounting
and control

The work in this task will be directed toward developing methods for
maintaining a long-term reactivity balance in an MSBR system. The estab-
lished technique of accounting for all significant reactivity additions
and withdrawals from the reactor system, including the calculation of
buildup and burnout of poisons, will be complicated in an MSBR because
many factors that can affect reactivity may not be determinable in a Gi
system utilizing continuous fuel processing. Methods based on subcrit-
icality measurements will be considered. The accuracy with which a long
term reactivity balance can be established will be defined in order to

 

provide Program guidance in the areas of technology development related

to control systems and equipment and to safety analyses.

12.4.10 Task 11.1.7 Evaluation of need for fast scram capability

The work in this task will be directed to evaluating the need for fast a

scram capability in MSBR systems, and to defining the consequences of
fast scram in terms of system transients and the effects on control
systems, components, and system temperatures and pressures.

12.4.11 Task 11.1.8 Determination of processing plant instrumentation
needs

The work in this task will be directed to determining the instrumentation
required for safe and efficient operation of the fuel processing system.

This task interfaces closely with Task 2.1.6 (Processing System Control)
in which the primary control variables for the processing system will be
identified and their relation to the desired control action specified.
The work in this task will be concerned with developing the control sys-
tems necessary for maintaining important process variables within desired
limits.

12.5 TASK GROUP 11.2 INSTRUMENTATION DEVELOPMENT

12.5.1 Objective

The objective of this task group is to develop the technology required
for design and specification of instrumentation for a 1000-MV(e) MSBR.

12.5.2 Schedule

The schedule for this task group is shown in Table 12.5.2.

12.5.3 Funding

The operating funds required by this task group are shown in Table 12.5.3.
Capital equipment funds in the amount of $170,000 will be required during
FY 1980 for design and construction of the Instrumentation Test Facility.

12.5.4 Facilities

Melten-salt breeder reactors will need instrumentation for sensing flows,
temperatures, pressures, liquid levels, and other parameters in molten
salts at temperatures as high as 750°C. Such instrumentation, satisfac-
tory for use in an MSBR, does not presently exist. Much of the testing
of instrumentation that is developed will be done in facilities provided
for testing of major components. A separate small facility is needed
for making preliminary tests on models or prototypes of new sensors as
they are developed. No facility presently exists in which such tests
could be made.

An instrument test facility will be constructed which will consist of a
small salt circulation loop, a set of tanks containing salt for static
tests, essential auxiliaries, test stands on which the equipment will be
mounted, housings, and a ventilation system. The facility will include
the instrumentation and controls necessary for operation of the equipment.

Cover gas will be obtained from a system used by several facilities.

Qf f-gas will be discharged to a common off-gas system. The facility will
provide for simple static and dynamic tests of models and protoypes of
reactor instruments as they are developed. Simple thermal transient and
thermal cycling tests can be made prior to more elaborate and extensive
tests in other facilities. Electrical heating and air cooling will be
provided so that testing can be done at temperatures from the liquidus
temperature of the salt in use (as low as 350°C) to 750°C. This activity
will require obligation of $170,000 in FY 1980.

12.5.5 Task 11.2.1 Development of high temperature flux sensors

 

The work in this task will be directed to the development of devices for
measurement of neutron flux level at temperatures of 1000°F, or higher

if necessary, which will meet the high standards of reliability required
for use in MSBR control and protection systems. Attention will also be
given to the requirement that the flux sensors and associated signal
transmitting lines must operate in a high-temperature, high-radiation-
level environment. Prototypic flux sensors will be fabricated and tested
under representative conditions for MSBR application.

12.5.6 Task 11.2.2 Development of improved pressure, flow, and level
devices

 

The work in this task will be directed to the development of improved
devices which will allow direct measurement of pressure, flow, and level
in the primary and secondary salt circuits of an MSER.

12.5.6.1 Subtask 11.2.2.1 Direct differential and absolute pressure
transducers

 

The work in this subtask will be directed to the development of devices
and techniques allowing the direct measurement of differential and abso-
lute pressure in MSBR primary and secondary salt circuits, and which are
capable of operation at 1000-1300°F. Potential approaches for these
transducers will be identified, and the more promising approaches will
be considered in detail. Prototypic transducers will be constructed for
long-term testing under service conditions anticipated in MSR systems.

12.5.6.2 Subtask 11.2.2.2 Direct primary circuit flow measurements

 

Several of the more promising methods for MSBR control utilize variable
flow of fuel salt through portions of the primary circuit. Utilization

of these methods will be dependent upon the availability of highly re-
liable instrumentation allowing the direct measurement of salt flow rate
at one or more peints in the reactor primary circuit; such instrumentation
does not now exist. The work in this subtask will be directed initially
to the identification of potential methods for direct flow measurement

in the primary circuit, and tec the selection of those approaches which
offer the greatest potential. Development work will be carried out as
necessary leading to the fabrication and testing of prototypic devices
under service conditions anticipated in MSBR systems.

12.5.6.3 Subtask 11.2.2.3 Improved level devices

 

The level-measurement devices employed in the MSRE were based largely

on the indirect measurement of level via measurement of gas pressure in
bubbler devices. While satisfactory for many applications, it is highly
desirable that level devices be developed which measure directly the

salt level at critical points in an MSBR system. The work in this sub-
task will be directed to identifying potential level devices capable of
direct measurement, and to the necessary development of the more promising
devices. The work will culminate in the fabrication and testing of proto-
typic level devices which are capable of direct level measurements and

of operation at 1000 to 1300°F.

12.5.7 Task 11.2.3 Assessment of instrumentation availability
The work in this task will be directed to assessing the availability of

instrumentation required for MSBR operation and to identifying areas
where additional development work will be required.

13. MOLTEN-SALT TEST REACTOR MGCKUP

13.1 INCENTIVE FOR CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION OF REACTOR MOCKUP

The development work outlined in the earlier sections of this program
plan is aimed at providing the technology required for design of com-
ponents for a molten-salt test reactor. However, a number of important
aspects related to test-reactor design and operation cannot be fully
demonstrated by the outlined work. For this reason, it appears desirable
to design, construct, and operate a mockup consisting of important por-
tions of the test reactor. The systems to be mocked up would consist
largely of the primary and secondary circuits for the reactor plus por-
tions of the steam~raising equipment. The mockup would be designed for
operation in principally an isothermal manner and would be used for
testing of full-scale prototypic components for the test reactor. It is
intended that the test reactor mockup would be operated in a parallel
manner to other component development facilities, such as the Steam
Generator Model Test Installation, in which scaled-down versions of test
reactor components would be tested over the full range of anticipated
operating conditions.

Other benefits which would accrue from work associated with the test
reactor mockup include obtaining experience during the design and con-
struction phases which would be directly applicable to the test reactor,
providing an opportunity for testing of remote maintenance equipment and
techniques prior to test reactor operation, and allowing an opportunity

for operator training in support of the test reactor.

13.2 SCHEDULE AND REQUIRED FUNDING

Conceptual design of the test reactor mockup will be completed during
FY 1979, and FY 1981 authorization for final design and construction
will be requested. Detailed design of the MSTR mockup will be completed
by the end of FY 1983, and operation will begin during FY 1984. The
estimatad cost of the facility is $50 million. Operating fund require-
ments for the test reactor mockup through FY 1985 are shown in Table
13.2.

14. MOLTEN-SALT TEST REACTOR

A number of important questions related to the design of molten-salt
breeder reactors can be answered only through the construction and
operation of a test reactor. These include the need for additional
reactor operating and maintenance experience under conditions more
closely resembling molten-salt power reactors in order to obtain improved
estimates for the availability and maintenance costs of molten-salt
breeder reactors, the need for operation of a continuous processing
system in which representative quantities of protactinium and fission
products are present, and the need for an improved definition of the
behavior and distribution of noble-metal fission products in a reactor
system. Finally, there is the need for the ultimate demonstration that
a satisfactory material of construction for the reactor primary circuit
has been developed and the need for obtaining experience with design,
fabrication, and operation of larger reactor compcnents.

Neither the optimum size nor complexity of the test reactor has been
determined at this time. If at all possible, the test reactor should
be sufficiently large that experience can be obtained with components
that are full-scale for a demonstration reactor. It is anticipated that
the preliminary conceptual design studies outlined in Section 8 of this
program plan will lead to a clear definition of the design and operational
requirements for the test reactor. Final design of the system will be
completed by the end of FY 1985, and operation should begin early in

FY 1989. The estimated cost for design and construction of the test
reactor is $450 million. This estimate should be considered to be very
preliminary, since it is not supported by detailed design or cost esti-
mation. Operating fund requirements associated with the test reactor
through FY 1985 are shown in Table 14.1.
