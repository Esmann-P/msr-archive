ABSTRACT

An experimentel determination has been made of the heat transfer coefficients
for molten sodium hydroxide flowing in turbulent forced convection through a tube
of circular eross section and a length to diameter ratio of 200. Heat transfer
coefficients in the region of fully developed turbulent flow are reported for the
Reynolds modulus range of 6000-12000 and the temperature range of T00-900°F. The
equation, Nu/Pr0-}4 = 0.021 Re0-8, was found to correlate the data for (L/D) values
above 100. Thermal entry lengths are calculated for each run. Results show that
molten sodium hydroxide may be considered an ordinary fluid - i.e., any fluid other

than the liquid metals - as far as heat transfer is concerned.

INTRODUCTION

Sodium hydroxide can be used as a high temperature heat transfer medium.
This fluid freezes at 604LOF and possesses temperature stability to at least
1200°F. No data on the heat transfer properties of molten sodium hydroxide
are available in the technical literature. Therefore, an experimental in-
vestigation was undertaken to determine the convective heat transfer coefficient
for this fluid in turbulent flow within tubes of circular cross section.

In designing heat transfer equipment it is necessary to know the conductance,
or coefficient of heat transfer, between a surface and the fluid flowing past
the surface so as to be able to estimate the amount of heat transferred or to
predict the temperature differences existing within the system. This coefficient
is defined by the equation
where (q/A) is the heat flux through the metal fluid interface in Btu/hr-f£t2,
tg, the temperature of the metal surface at this interface and tj, the fluid

mixed-mean temperature. A number of investigators? 5+ &*

have developed systems,
both of the double-tube exchanger type and the single-tube electrically heated
wall type, which enable determination of the temperature, tg. For reasons of
simplicity of assembly and more accurate determination of the heat input and the

heat transfer area, the electrically heated test section was chosen for this

experiment.

 

*Numbers refer to references to the literature given in section V

Several factors must be considered in designing this type of test unit

for use with molten sodium hydroxide.

1.

Corrosion. The extreme corrosiveness of molten sodium hydroxide
drastically restricts the materials available for constructing the
system. At the time the problem was begun, static corrosion tests?
indicated that only three construction materials would be acceptable
for a system containing sodium hydroxide. These were pure silver,
graphite and A-nickel. Of these silver appeared to be the best
material. However, silver is structurally weak and at high tempera-
tures is unable to support its own weight. To be effective corrosion-
wise the silver must be oxygen free and thus the cost of a silver-
lined system becomes prohibitive. Graphite would require heavy,
ewkward structural sections to give sufficient strength. Hence,
nickel remains as the only feasible construction material. While
weaker than most construction metals it still possesses reasonable
strength at high temperatures and is commercially availeble in most
of the required forms.

Electrical Conductivity. While the electrical conductivity of molten
sodium hydroxide is not high as compared to the liquid metals, it is
still sufficiently large to necessitate that the system be designed to
minimize the heat generation in the test fluid. From this aspect
nickel was also satisfactory since its electrical conductivity was

such as to allow 95% of the heat generation to occur in the tube well

for a reasonably sized experimental system.
3. Pumps. Due to the unavailability of pumps for handling molten
sodium hydroxide another method of causing fluid flow through
the system must be devised. This was accomplished by pushing
the fluid through the system under the pressure of an inert gas,

argon.

4. Melting Point. The high melting point of sodium hydroxide (604°F)

increases the difficulty of system design.

II. EXPERIMENTAL WORK

A. Description of Apparatus

 

The experimental system designed to measure the heat transfer
coefficient is illustrated schematically in Figure 1. It consisted of
a sump tank, a test section with associated power supply and temperature
and power indicating devices, a tank resting on a seale for measuring the
fluid flow rate and a gas system for moving the fluid through the test
section. Figures 2, 3, and 4 present several views of the apparatus.

The sump and weigh tanks were electrically heated by strip heaters,
end the lines connecting the test section to the tanks were traced with
Calrod heaters. The entire system was well-lagged and was maintained ab
a ‘temperature of 650°F. Preliminary tests indicated that even when the
weigh tank was rigidly connected to the rest of the system the scale
readings were consistent and accurate. This was checked by visually
observing the scale action while introducing weighed amounts of water into
the tank and while placing weighed lead bricks on the scale. It was possible
to read the weight of fluid entering or leaving the weigh tank to within

1/2 pound.

In the design of an electrically heated test section, the size of
the tubing used is dictated by several factors; namely, allowable pressure
drop through the test section, desired length to diameter ratio, avail-
ability of the proper size tubing, the temperature drop through the tube
wall as related to the temperature difference between the inside tube
surface and the fluid mixed-mean, the physical size of the system as
related to the fluid inventory, the minimization of heat generation in
the test fluid and the total power available. On the basis of these
considerations a test section was designed of nickel tubing, 3/16" 0.D.

x 0.035" wall thickness, 24 inches long. With this test section a flow
at a Reynolds modulus of 10% could be obtained with a pressure drop of
35 psi. The heat generated in the tube wall accounted for 95% of the
total heat generation.

Since gas pressure was used to move the molten sodium hydroxide
through the test seetion, the system was capable only of intermittent
operation with the fluid flowing first from the sump to the weigh tank
and then from the weigh to the sump tank. A total of 220 pounds of sodium
hydroxide was put into the system.

The power was supplied to the test section by a transformer capable
of delivering a maximum of 360 emperes at 7.5 volts. This was introduced
to the test section through small rectangular copper flanges silver-soldered
to the tube at the inlet and outlet of the test section. The current to
the test section was measured with a multi-range ammeter. The accuracy of
this meter is claimed as 3/4%.

The temperature of the outer surface of the test section was measured
at 20 points along the tube and at the power flanges at the inlet and outlet

of the test section. The couples were of 36 gage chromel and alumel wire
 

15

and were welded to the tube surface by a single-pulse resistance welder.
They were then wrapped around the tube for about one-quarter of a turn

in order to minimize conduction losses along the thermocouple leads. At
the two ends of the test section thermocouples were encased in pieces of
two-hole ceramic insulator, inserted in small holes in the power flanges
and arc-welded to the tube wall. All couples were then connected to a
Leeds and Northrup portable precision potentiometer through selector
switches. A common cold Junction was used. This consisted of an ice-water
mixture in a one pint Dewar flask which was jacketed by a can filled with
thermal insulation.

Temperatures for control purposes were measured by thermocouples of
28 gage iron and constantan wires located along the tubing and in thermo-
wells in the tanks. The temperatures were indicated on a precision
temperature indicator.

The voltage was measured at the 10 locations along the test section
indicated in Figure 5. Two of these voltage taps were located on the power
flanges to the test section. The voltage taps were of 28 gage bare copper
wire, arc-welded to the tube. These were then coated with #7 Sauereisen
cement to reduce oxidation of the copper at the operating temperature of
the system. The voltage was measured by a multiple-range Ballantine
electronic voltmeter, for which an accuracy of 2% is claimed.

The mixed-mean temperature of the fluid entering and leaving the
test section was obtained by inserting mixing pots in the test line. These
were located one inch from the inlet and outlet of the test section. The
mixing pot was a two inch length of standard one inch nickel pipe capped
at both ends. A perforated nickel disc was located at the center. The

inlet and outlet were tangentially positioned at the top and bottom.

Thermowells were placed immediately behind the inlet and before the
outlet. A mixing pot is shown in Figure 4. It is believed that with
the whirling flow caused by the tangential inlet and the mixing eaused
by the diffuser disc, a good mixed-mean temperature was obtained. An
analysis of the error due to conduction losses by the thermowell at an
average fluid temperature of 950°F shows the correction to the observed
thermocouple reading to be negligibly small. The mixing pots were
wrapped with a double layer of monel-sheathed nichrome heating wire.
The current ‘through these heaters was adjusted to maintain a temperature

of approximately 650°F in the mixing pot so as to prevent freezing of

4he sodium hydroxide and reduce heat loss from the fluid.

The entire test unit - test section plus mixing pots - was jacketed

by a metal container filled with thermal insulation.

System Calibration
l. Heat Loss

In order to obtain an estimate of the heat loss from the
system, current was passed through the tube wall without fluid
flow through the test section. At equilibrium, the power input
for a given average tube wall temperature with no fluid flow was
taken to be the system heat loss for the same average tube wall
temperature with fluid flow. The outside tube wall temperature
is shown in Figure 6 as a function of the distance along the test
section for various power levels. Figure 7 shows the system heat
loss as a function of At, where At is the average outside tube wall
temperature, ty aye, minus the temperature of the system environment,

te. The average outside tube wall temperature was obtained by

graphieal integration of the curves of Figure 6.

2. Thermocouple Calibration

 

Bead thermocouples of 36 gage chromel and alumel wire were
calibrated at the melting points of lead and zine. Samples of
the wire used for the tube wall thermocouples were calibrated
in a tube furnace. The results of these calibrations are in-
dicated in Figure 8. A maximum correction of 5°F at 900°F was
observed.

3. Effect of Tube Current on Thermocouples

 

The possible effect of the current flowing through the tube
wall on the readings of the thermocouples attached to the wall was
considered. Therefore, with no flow through the tube, the system
was allowed to reach equilibrium and the reading of one wall thermo-
couple recorded. The power to the tube was then turned off and
readings of this thermocouple taken every 15 seconds. These yower-
off readings were then extrapolated back to zero time. As is seen
from Figure 9, the current in the tube wall has no effect on the

readings of the thermocouples.

Method of Operation

Prior to operation, the entire system - sump and weigh tanks and the
test unit - was heated to an average temperature of 650°F. During a
sequence of runs this temperature would drift up to about 750°F due to the
heat put into the fluid by the test section. The desired flow rate was
obtained by proper adjustment of the gas pressures at the sump and weigh
tanks. Runs lasted from 20 to 40 minutes depending on the fluid flow
rate. Tt was found that during this period the system reached approximate

equilibrium. This is indicated in Figure 10 which gives the readings

from a given thermocouple as a function of time during an experimental
run. The tube wall thermocouples were read every 3 to 5 minutes during
a run. Data were obtained with the fluid flowing from the weigh to the
sump tank, as well as from the sump to the weigh tank.

The sodium hydroxide charged to the system had an original assay of
98.5% NaOH, 0.31% NapCO3 and the rest water. The water was removed during

the melting cyele by maintaining the system under vacuum.

III. RESULTS
A. Method of Calculation
The coefficient of heat transfer at any point, x, along the test
section is known as the local coefficient of heat transfer and is defined
by the equation

hy = (a/A)x 2)

(ts - tm) x

For values of x large enough to be beyond the thermal entrance region,
hx reaches a limiting value, h, the coefficient of heat transfer for the
region in which turbulent flow has been fully established both thermally
and hydrodynamieally.

In order to determine the local coefficient of heat transfer, it is
necessary to obtain from the experimental data the heat flux, the tempera-
ture of the inside wall of the tube and the fluid mixed-mean temperature
at each point along the tube.

Phe inside tube wall temperature is calculated from the measured

outside tube wall temperature by the equation

2.2
- W (r2 r /r. . Ty -Is
ty-tg = = (Typ" In w/Ts Hog) (3)

where the subscripts w and s indicate the cutside and inside tube walls,
respectively, and r is the tube radius; ky; is the thermal conductivity of

the nickel tube.

This equation takes intc account the effect of the heat generation
in the tube wall on the temperature drop through the wall. The
derivation of this equation is given in Appendix III. The source term,
W, is glven by
w= & = I (4)
vhere E and I are the voltage and current at the test section, c¢ is

 

the conversion factor, 3.413 Btu/hr-watt, and V is the volume of metal
in the tube wall of the test section.

It is assumed that the heat generation is uniform in the tube wall.
This is borne out by Figure 5 which shows the voltage impressed on the
test section as a function of distance along the tube for a typical
run. With uniform heat generation, the fluid mixed-mean temperature
as a function of the distance down the tube is given by a straight line
drewn between tp j and ¥m,o, the fluid mixed-mean inlet and outlet
temperatures, respectively. Actually, dve to heat losses in the vicinity
of the power flanges, not all of the heat generated is transferred into
the test fluid. This results in a slightly lower slope for the mixed-
mean temperature curve in the immediate vicinity of the power flanges
and a correspondingly slight raising of the slope through the central
portion. However, since the heat loss through the power flanges was
found to be low, less thar 2% of the total heat input, the errcr intro-
duced by assuming a straight line between tm, 1 and 45,0 is small.

The total heat generation in the tube wall is debermined from the
measured voltage drop across the test section and the current passing
through the tube wall. Part of the total heat goes to external loss

and the rest into heating the fluid in the test section. The external
 

20

heat loss can be obtained from Figure 7 for the average outside
tube wall temperature for the given set of experimental data. The
heat transferred into the fluid in passing through the test section
is given by the equation

Qp = W ep(tm,0 = tm, 1) (5)
where w is the fluid flow rate in lbs/hr, and tm,0 and tm,i the
fluid mixed-mean outlet and inlet temperatures, respeetively. The
heat transfer area is taken as the inside surface area of the test
section between the two power flanges. The heat flux wae based on the
heat gained by the fluid as given by equation (5). This was checked
by the electrical power input corrected for the measured external heat
loss. A maximum deviation between these two of 9% was observed. The
heat balance for each run is shown in Teble I.

A sample calculation for the determination of the loeal coefficient
of heat transfer is presented in Appendix I. Figure 11 shows a typical
temperature profile for the inside tube wall.

The physical properties of sodium hydroxide necessary to these
calculations are presented graphically in Appendix II. The physieal

properties were evaluated at the average fluid mixed-mean temperature.

Correlation of the Heat Transfer Coefficient

By considering the dimensionless differential equations describing
heat transfer and fluid flow, a number of dimensionless moduli arise
which characterize forced convection heat transfer in similar systems.
These dimensionless parameters (Nusselt, Reynolds and Prandtl moduli)
are functionally related by the equation

Nu = o (Re, Pr) (6)

Reynoldsl2, Prandt11l, von Kérman®, Boelter, Martinelli and
Jonassen’ and others have determined the analytical form of the
funetion, ¢ , for turbulent flow by comparing heat and momentum
transfer within the fluid for several ideal systems approximating
real systems.
For convenience, equation 6 is usually written in the empirical

form
Nu = a Rel PrP (7)

where the constants a, n and p are experimentally determined. In
general n is taken as 0.8. Dittus and Boelters found that equation 7
could be written as

Nu = 0.023 ReO-8 pr0-% (10)

In Table I are listed the pertinent measurements and calculated re-
sults of the present sodium hydroxide experiment. The heat transfer
coefficient was calculated for a position for down-streem (I/D = 100 or
greater) where fully developed turbulent flow existed.

Plotting the experimental data as Nu vs Pr for various values of
Re, it is seen that P in equation 7 is approximately 0.4. A least
squares analysis of the data then yields the result, a = 0.021. That is,
the experimental turbulent forced convection data for molten sodium
hydroxide ean be correlated by the equation

Nu = 0.021 ReQ-8 prO.% (11)

for values of the Reynolds modulus between 6000 and 12000.

The standard deviation of the data from this equation, assuming that
the Reynolds modulus is exactly known, is 0.001.

The experimental data are shown in Figure 12 with relation to
the derived correlating equation,ll, and the McAdams equation,l0. It

is seen that the data lie approximately 9% below equation 10.

Thermal Entrance Region

It was possible to obtain from the experimental data for each rum,
the thermal entrance length. This length is defined as the distance
from the entrance of the test section at which the heat transfer
coefficient has reached a value within a given percentage of the
established value. The entrance length is normally expressed in terms
of the number of tube diameters from the entrance.

The local coefficient of heat transfer is shown in Figure 13 as
a function of the ratio, (L/D), for a typical experimental run. Figure
14 gives the variation of the thermal entrance length, (L/D)e; with the
Peclet modulus (Re:Pr). In the present investigation (L/D)e was teken
as the (L/D) at which the loeal conductance had dropped to a value of
1.1 of the established value.

PoppendieklO reviews the thermal entrance length data for an air
system (Humble, Lowdermilk and Desmon® measurements) and for a mercury
system (English and Barrett* measurements). Both of these experiments
were conducted under conditions of uniform heat flux. Based on the
thermal entrance length eriterion used in the present report, he found
that for air, (L/D)e = 15 or greater, and for mercury, (L/D)e = 5 or

greater.

Analysis of Errors
Error theory shows that for a function of several variables,
M=f(m, mp, ..., my), the maximum error in M, AM, can be approxi-

mated by the expression,

Am= OM oM veo + OM :
m Sm OL Sm; Ome + + =o Arn

 

 

However, it is to be noted that the actual error in M might not
equal the maximum error calculated, as errors in the various
measured quantities might offset each other.
Applying this type of analysis to the present experiment,
the following errors can be tabulated:
1. For the heat flux, (ar/A),
a. error in (tm,o - tm, 1), 1%
b. error in flow rate, w, 0.6%
c. error in heat transfer area, A, 1.4%

for a total error of 3

2. For the temperature difference, (tg - tp),
a. error in temperature, ty, 0.5%

b. error in temperature drop through tube

wall, ty - tg, 2b

c. error in fluid mixed-mean temperature,
tm,

for a total error of 4.5%
Thus, the maximum possible error in h is 7.5%.
The precision of the experiment as indicated by the standard

deviation obtained through a least squares analysis of the data

is 4.5%.

Derivation of Equation for Temperature Drop Across

The transient conduction equation for the case in which heat generation

exists within the solid is

where
¢ = thermal diffusity = an

vot = Laplacian of t

W = source term in Btu/br. £t5
Then for steady state conditions, ~2t = 0, and uniform heat generation,

= constant. For a circular tube, the Laplacian as expressed in cylindrical
coordinates is

ot = Ea 13.2, 1%

Since the temperature distribution is symmetrical with respect to 0, 2% = 0
