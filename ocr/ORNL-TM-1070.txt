STABILITY ANALYSIS OF THE MOLTEN-SALT
REACTOR EXPERIMENT

S. J. Ball T. W. Kerlin

Abstract

A detailed analysis shows that the Molten-Salt Reactor
Experiment is inherently stable. It has sluggish transient
response at low power, but this creates no safety or opera-
tional problems. The study included analysis of the tran-
sient response, frequency response, and pole configuration.
The effects of changes in the mathematical model for the
system and in the characteristic parameters were studied.

A systematic analysis was also made to find the set of
parameters, within the estimated uncertainty range of the
design values, that gives the least stable condition. The
system was found to be inherently stable for this condition,
as well as for the design condition.

te pm
ol o"

The system stability was underestimated in earlier
studies of MSRE transient behavior. This was partly due to
the approximate model previously used. The estimates of
the values for the system parameters in the earlier studies
also led to less stable predictions than current best values.

The stability increases as the power level increases and
is largely determined by the relative reactivity contribu-
tions of the prompt feedback and the delayed feedback. The
large heat capacities of system components, low heat transfer
coefficients, and fuel circulation cause the delayed reac-
tivity feedback.

 

: | 7 UU) mntroduckion

| Investigations of inherent stability constitute an essential part of
a reactor evaluation. This is particularly true for a new type of system,
such as the MSRE. The first consideration in such an analysis is to de-
- termine whether the system possesses inherent self-destruction tendencies.
"Other less important but significant considerations are the influence of
inherent characteristics on control system requirements and the possi-
bility of conducting experiments that require constant conditions for ex-

" tended periods.

 
 

Several approaches may be used for stability analysis. A complete
study of power reactor dynamics would take into account the inherent non-
linearity of the reactivity feedback. It is not difficult to calculate
the transient response of nonlinear systems with analog or digital com-
puters. On the other hand, it is not currently possible to study the
stability of multicomponent nonlinear systems in a general fashion. The
usual method is to linearize the feedback terms in the system equations
and use the well-developed methods of linear-feedback theory for stability
analysis. This leads to the use of the frequency response (Bode plots or
Nyquist plots) or root locus for stability analysis. This study included
nonlinear transient-response calculations and linearized frequency-response
and root-locus calculations.

The stability of a dynamic system can depend on a delicate balance
of the effects of many components. This balance may be altered by changes
in the mathematical model for the system or by changes in the values of
the parameters that characterize the system. Since neither perfect models
nor exact parameters can be obtained, the effect of changes in each of
these on predicted stability should be determined, as was done in this
study.

The transient and frequency responses obtained in a stability analy-
sis are also needed for comparison with results of dynamic tests on the
system. The dynamic tests may indicate that modifications in the theo-
retical model or in the design data are needed. Such modifications can
provide a confirmed model that may be used for interpreting any changes
possibly observed in the MSRE dynamic behavior in subsequent operation
and for predicting, with confidence, the stability of other similar

systems.

2. Description of the MSRE

The MSRE is a graphite-moderated, circulating-fuel reactor with fluo-
ride salts of uranium, lithium, beryllium, and zirconium as the fuel.?
The basic flow diagram is shown in Fig. 1. The molten fuel-bearing salt
enters the core matrix at the bottom and passes up through the core in
channels machined out of 2-in. graphite blocks. The 10 Mw of heat

generated in the fuel and transferred from the graphite raises the fuel
temperature from 1175°F at the inlet to 1225°F at the outlet. When the
system operates at lower power, the flow rate is the same as at 10 Mw,
and the temperature rise through the core decreases. The hot fuel salt
travels to the primary heat exchanger, where it transfers heat to a non-
fueled secondary salt before reentering the core. The heated secondary
salt travels to an air-cooled radiator before returning to the primary
heat exchanger.
Dynamically, the two most important characteristics of the MSRE are
that the core is heterogeneous and that the fuel circulates. Since this =

combination of important characteristics is uncommon, a detailed study Oo.

of stability was required. The fuel circulation acts to reduce the ef-
fective delayed-neutron fraction, to reduce the rate of fuel temperature
change during a power change, and to introduce delayed fuel-temperature
and neutron-production effects. The heterogeneity introduces a delayed
feedback effect due to graphite temperature changes.

The MSRE also has a large ratio of heat capacity to power production.
This indicates that temperatures will change slowly with power changes.
This also suggests that the effects of the negative temperature coeffi-
cients will appear slowly, and the system will be sluggish. This type
of behavior, which is more pronounced at low power, is evident in the
results of this study.

Another factor that contributes to the sluggish time response is the
heat sink — the air radiator. An approximate time constant for heating

vp »

and cooling the entire primary and secondary system was found by consider-
ing all the salt, graphite, and metal as one lumped heat capacity that
dumps heat through a resistance into the air (sink), as indicated in Fig.
2. For the reactor operating at 10 Mw with a mean reactor temperature

of about 1200°F and s sink temperature of about 200°F, the effective re-

sistance must be

1200°F — 200°F

TB = 100°F/Mw .

For the reactor operating at 1 Mw, the sink temperature increases to about
400°F. This is due to a reduction in cooling air flow provided at low
power to keep the fuel temperature at 1225°F at the core exit. In this

case the resistance is

This very long time-response behavior would not be as pronounced with a
heat sink such as a steam generator, where the sink temperatures would

be considerably higher.

3. Review of Studies of MSRE Dynamics

 

Three types of studies of MSRE dynamics were previously made:
(1) transient-behavior analyses of the system during normal operation
with an automatic controller, (2) abnormel-transient and accident studies,
and (3) ‘transient-behavior analyses of the system without external con-
trol. ‘The automatic rod control system operates in either a neutron-flux
control mode, for low-power operation, or in a temperature control mode

at higher powers.?

The predicted response of the reactor under servo con-
trol for large changes in load demand indicated that the system is both
stable and controllable. The abnormal-transient and accident studies
showed that credible transients are not dangerous.>

The behavior of the reactor without servo control was initially in-
vestigated in 1960 and 1961 by Burke.%7 A subsequent controller study

by Ball® in 1962 indicated that the system had greater inherent stability

than predicted by Burke. Figure 3 shows comparable transient responses
for the two cases. The differences in predicted response are due to dif-
ferences both in the model and in the parameters used and will be dis-
cussed in detail in Section 6.

There are two important aspects of the MSRE's inherent stability
characteristics that were observed in the earlier studies. First, the
reactor tends to become less stable at lower powers, and second, the
period of oscillation is very long and increases with lower powers. As
shown in Fig. 3, the period is sbout 9 min at 1 Mw, so any tendency of

the system to oscillate can be easily controlled. Also, since the system

is self-stabilizing at higher powers, it would not tend to run away, or

as in this case, creep away. The most objectionable aspect of inherent
oscillations would be their interference with tests planned for the re-

actor without automatic control.

4. Description of Theoretical Models

 

Several different models have been used in the dynamic studies of
the MSRE. Also, because the best estimates of parameter values were modi-
fied periodically, each study was based on a different set of parameters.
Since the models and parameters are both important factors in the predic-
tion of stability, their influence on predicted behavior was examined in
this study. Tables 1, 2, and 3 summarize the various models and parameter
sets used. Table 1 lists the parameters for each of the three studies,
Table 2 indicates how each part of the reactor was represented in the
three different models, and Table 3 indicates which model was used for
each study. The three models are referred to subsequently as the "Re-
duced," "Intermediate," and "Complete" models, as designated in Table 2.
The models are described in this section, and the equations used are given

in Appendix A. The coefficients for each case are listed in Appendix B.

transfer rate between the graphite and the fuel stream on the difference
of their average temperatures. The outlet of the first lump or "well-
stirred tank" in the fuel stream is taken as the fluid average temperature.
Thus a dotted arrow is shown from this point to the graphite to represent
the driving force for heat transfer. However, all the mass of the fluid
is in the lumps, and the heat transferred is distributed equally between
the lumps. Therefore solid arrows are shown from the graphite to each
fluid lump to indicate actual transfer of heat.

This model was developed by E. R. Mann* and has distinct advantages
over the usual model for representing the fluid by a single lump in which
the following algebraic relationship is used to define the mean fuel tem-
perature:

Tp inlet + Tp outlet

. Tp mean = 7 .

The outlet temperature of the model is given by

Tp outlet = Ty, mean — Tn inlet

Since the mean temperature variable represents a substantial heat
capacity (in liquid systems), it does not respond instantaneously to
changes in inlet temperature. Thus a rapid increase in inlet temperature
would cause a decrease in outlet temperature — clearly a nonphysical re-
sult. With certain limitations on the length of the flow path, ? Mann's
model avoids this difficulty.

The reduced MSRE model used one region to represent the entire core,
and the nuclear average temperatures were taken as the average graphite
temperature (Ty) and the temperature of the first fuel lump (Tgp )- The
nuclear average temperature is defined as the temperature that will give
the reactivity feedback effect when multiplied by the appropriate tem-
perature coefficient of reactivity.

The intermediate and complete models employ the nine-region core

model shown schematically in Fig. 5. Each region contains two fuel lumps

and one graphite lump, as shown in Fig. 4. This gives a total of 18 lumps
(or nodes) to represent the fuel and nine lumps to represent the graphite.
The nuclear power distribution and nuclear importances for all 27 lumps
were calculated with the digital code EQUIPOISE-3A, which solves steady-
state, two-group, neutron-diffusion equations in two dimensions.

Tests were made on the MSRE full-scale core hydraulic mockup*© to
check the validity of the theoretical models of core fluid transport. A
salt solution was injected suddenly into the 1200-gpm water stream at the
reactor vessel inlet of the mockup, and the response at the reactor outlet
was measured by a conductivity probe. The frequency response of the sys-
tem was computed from the time response by Samulon's method! for a sam-
pling rate of 2.5/sec. The equivalent mixing characteristics of the
theoretical models are computed from the transfer function of core outlet-~
to-inlet temperature by omitting heat transfer to the graphite and adding
pure delays for the time for fluid transport from the point of salt in-
jection to the core inlet and from the core outlet to the conductivity
probe location. A comparison of the experimental, one-region, and nine-
region transfer functions is shown by frequency-response plots in Fig. 6.
Both theoretical curves compare favorably with the experimental curve,
especially in the range of frequencies important in the stability study
(0.01 to 0.1 radians/sec). The relatively large attenuation of the mag-
nitude ratios at frequencies as low as 0.1 to 1.0 radians/sec is due to
a considerable amount of axial mixing, which is to be expected at the
low Reynolds number of the core fluid flow (~1000). This test indicates
that the models used for core fuel circulation in the stability analyses

are adequate.

Neutron Kinetics

The standard one-point, nonlinear, neutron kinetics equations with
one average delayed-neutron group were used in all the analog and digital
transient response studies. Linearized equations were used for all the
other studies. In the studies of a nine-region core model, weighted
values of nuclear importance for each of the 27 lumps were used to compute

the thermal feedback reactivity. Six delayed-neutron groups and the

dynamic effects of the circulation of the precursors around the primary

loop were included in the complete model.

* Heat Exchanger and Radiator

The lumping scheme used to represent heat transfer in both the heat
exchanger and the radiator is shown in Fig. 7. As with the core model,
two lumps are used to represent each fluid flow path. The reduced and
~ intermediate models both used one section as shown. The complete model

used ten of these sections connected sequentially.

Fluid Transport and Heat Transfer in Connecting Piping

The reduced model used single well-stirred-tank approximations for
fluid transport in the piping from the core to the heat exchanger, from
the heat exchanger to the core, from the heat exchanger to the radiator,
and from the radiator back to the heat exchanger. Since the flow is
highly turbulent (primary system, Re w 240,000; secondary system,

Re w 120,000), there is relatively little axial mixing, and thus a plug
flow model is probably superior to the well-stirred-tank model. Fourth-
order Padé approximations were used in the intermediate model ‘and pure
delays in the complete model (see Appendix A). Heat transfer to the pip-

ing and vessels was also included in the complete model.

Xenon Behavior

The transient poisoning effects of xenon in the core were considered
only in the complete model. The equations include iodine decay into xe-

non, xenon decay and burnup, and xenon absorption into the graphite.

Delayed Power
In all three models, the delayed-gamma portion of the nuclear power

was approximated by a first-order lag.

5. Stability Analysis Results

Data were obtained with the best available estimates of the system
parameters for analysis by the transient-response, closed-loop frequency-
response, open-loop frequency-response, and pole-configuration (root
locus) methods. The advantages in using various analytical methods are
that (1) comparison of the results provides a means of checking for com-
putational errors; (2) some methods are more useful than others for spe-
cific purposes; for example, the pole-configuration analysis gives a
clear answer to the question of stability, but frequency-response methods
are needed to determine the physical causes of the calculated behavior;
and (3) certain methods ‘are more meaningful to a reader than others, de-
pending on his technical badkground. The differences between the results
and earlier results’ are discussed in Section 6, and the effects of
changes in the mathematical model and the system parameters are examined
in Section 7.

The results show that the MSRE has satisfactory inherent stability
characteristics. Its inherent response to a perturbation at low power
is characterized by a slow return to steady state after a series of low-
frequency oscillations. This undesirable but certainly safe behavior at

low power can easily be smoothed out by the control system. ?

Transient Response

The time response of a system to a perturbation is a useful and
easily interpreted measure of dynamic performance. It is not as useful
in showing the reasons behind the observed behavior as some of the other
methods discussed below, but it has the advantage of being a physically
observable (and therefore familiar) process.

The time response of the reactor power to a step change in k ee was

calculated. The IBM-7090 code MATEXP*? was used. MATEXP solves general,

nonlinear, ordinary differential equations of the form

where
Xx = the solution vector,
A = system matrix (constant square matrix with real coefficients),
AA(x) = a matrix whose elements are deviations from the values in A
[thus AA(x) x includes all nonlinear effects],
f(t) = forcing function vector.

The A matrix was developed for the intermediate model and resulted in a
59 xX 59 matrix.

The transient response of the neutron level to a step change in k off
of +0. Ol% is shown in Fig. & for initial power levels of 10 and 1 Mw.
The slow response is evident. Figure 8 also clearly shows that the re-

actor takes longer to return to steady state in a 1-Mw transient than in

. a 10-Mw transient. It is also clear that the power does not diverge

(i.e., the system is stable).

It should be emphasized that this transient analysis included the
nonlinearities inherent in the neutron kinetics equations. The fact that
the results of the other analyses presented below, which are based on
linear models, agree in substance with these results verifies the adequacy

of the linear analyses for small perturbations.

Closed-Loop Frequency Response

The closed-loop transfer function is defined as the Laplace trans-
form of a selected output variable divided by the Laplace transform of
a selected input variable. If the system is stable, it is possible to
replace the Laplace transform varisble, s, with ju, where j =v~L and
w is the angular frequency of a sinusoidal input. A transfer function,
G(w), evaluated at a particular w is a complex quantity. The amplitude
of G(w) physically represents the gain, or the ratio of the amplitude of
the output sinusoid to the amplitude of the input sinusoid. The phase
angle of G(w) represents the phase difference between the input and out-
put sinusoids. A logarithmic plot of amplitude ratio and phase angle as
a function of w is called a Bode plot, or frequency-response plot.

The relationship between the frequency response and the time response
due to a sinusoidal input is useful conceptually and experimentally. How-
ever, it may be shown that the Bode plot for a linear system also provides

in the amplitude ratio curve. High narrow peaks indicate that the system

The MSFR code (a special-purpose code for the MSRE frequency-

for this calculation. The results for several power levels are shown in
Fig. 9. Fewer phase-angle curves than magnitude curves are shown in order
to avoid cluttering the plot.

Several observations .can be based on the information of Fig. 9.
First, the peaks of the magnitude curves get taller and sharper with lower
power. This indicates that the system is more oscillatory at low power.
Also the peaks in the low-power curves rise above the no-feedback curve.
This indicates that the feedback is regenerative at these power levels.
Also, since the frequency at which the magnitude ratio has a peak approxi-
mately corresponds to the frequency at which the system will naturally
oscillate in response to a disturbance, the low-power oscillations are
much lower in frequency than the 10-Mw oscillations. The periods of os-
cillation range from 22 min at O.1 Mw to 1.3 min at 10 Mw.

Figure 9 shows that the peak of the 10-Mw magnitude ratio curve is
very broad and indicates that any oscillation would be small and quickly
demped out. The dip in this curve at 0.25 radians/sec is due to the 25-
sec fuel circulation time in the primary loop [i.e., (2m radians/cycle)/
(25 sec/cycle) = 0.25 radians/sec]. Here a fuel-temperature perturbation
in the core is reinforced by the perturbation generated one eycle earlier
that traveled around the loop. - Because of the negative fuel-temperature
coefficient of reactivity, the power perturbation is attenuated.

The relatively low gains shown at low frequencies .can be attributed
to the large change in steady-state core temperatures that would result
from a relatively small change in nuclear power with the radiator air
flow rate remaining constant. . This means that only a small change in
power is required to bring about cancellation of an input 8k perturbation

by a change in the nuclear average temperatures.

Open-Loop Frequency Response

A simplified block diagram representation of a reactor as a closed-
loop feedback system is shown in Fig. 10. The forward loop, G, represents
the nuclear kinetics transfer function with no temperature effects, and
the feedback loop, H, represents the temperature (and reactivity) changes
due to nuclear power changes. ‘

The closed-loop equation is found by solving for N in terms of Bk:
N =G 8k, = GHN
in

or

N G -
8k, 1 +0GH (2)
an

The quantity GH is called the open-loop transfer function, and represents
the response at point b of Fig. 10 if the loop is broken at point b.
Equation (2) shows that the denominator of the closed-loop transfer func-
tion vanishes if GH = —1. Also, according to the Nyquist stability cri-
terion, the system is unstable if the phase of GH is more negative than
-180° when the magnitude ratio is unity. Thus it is clear that the open-
loop frequency response contains information about system dynamics that
are important in stability analyses.

A useful measure of system stability is the phase margin. It is de-
fined as the difference between 180° and the open-loop phase angle when
the gain is 1.0. A discussion of the phase margin and its uses may be
found in suitable references on servomechanism theory.1® For this appli-
cation, it suffices to note that smaller phase margins indicate reduced
stability. A general rule of thumb in automatic control practice is that
a phase margin of at least 30° is desirable. Phase margins less than 20°

indicate lightly damped oscillation and poor control. Zero degrees in-

 dicates an oscillating system, and -negative phase margins indicate insta-
bility. LL

The phase margin as a function of reactor power level is shown in
Fig. 11. The phase margin decreases as the power decreases and goes below
30° at about 0.5 Mw. However, the phase margin is still positive (12°)
at 0.1 Mw. These small phase margins at low power suggest slowly damped

oscillations, as has been observed in the transient-response and closed-
loop frequency-response results. The period of oscillation as a function
of power level is also shown in Fig. 11.

Figure 12 shows Nyquist plots for the open-loop transfer function,
GH, at 1.0 Mw and 10.0 Mw. It is clear that the unstable condition of
(Jou) = 1 and phase angle —180°) is avoided. In order for the phase mar-
gin to be a reliable indication of stability, the Nyquist plot must be
"well-mannered" inside the unit circle; that is, it should not approach
the critical (~1.0 +j0) point. Although the curves shown in Fig. 12 be-
have peculiarly in approaching the origin, they do not get close to the

critical point.

Pole Configuration

The denominator (1 + GH) of the closed-loop transfer function of a
lumped-parameter system is a polynomial in the Laplace transform variable,
s. The roots of this polynomial (called the characteristic polynomial)
are the poles of the system transfer function. The poles are equal to
the eigenvalues of the system matrix A in Eq. (1). A necessary and suf-
ficient condition for linear stability is that the poles all have nega-
tive real parts. Thus, it is useful to know the location of the poles in
the complex plane and the dependence of their location on power level.

The poles were calculated for the intermediate model of the MSRE
(see Section 4). The matrix used was the linearized version of the
59 X 59 matrix used in the transient analysis. The: calculations were
performed with a modification of the general matrix eigenvalue code QR'4

for the IBM-7090. The results are shown in Fig. 13 for several of the

‘major poles. All the other poles lie far to the left of the ones shown.

It is clear from Fig. 13 that the system is stable at all power levels.

The set of complex poles that goes to zero as the power decreases is the

- set primarily responsible for the calculated dynamic performance. The

imaginary part of this set approximately represents the natural frequency

of oscillation of the system following a disturbance. The frequency of

oscillation decreases as. the power decreases, as observed previously.

6. Interpretation of Results

Explanation of the Inherent Stability Characteristics

A physical explanation of the predicted stability characteristics
is presented in this section, and an attempt is made to explain the rea-
sons for the changes in inherent stability with power level. The reasons
for the behavior are not intuitively obvious. Typically a feedback system
will become more stable when the open-loop gain is reduced. The MSRE,
however, becomes less stable at lower powers. In the discussion of open-
loop frequency response (Sect. 5) it was noted that the forward-loop
transfer function G represents the nuclear kinetics (N/8k) with no
temperature-feedback effects, and from the equations (Appendix A), the
gain of G is directly proportional to power level. Thus the MSRE is not
"typical" but has the characteristics of what is known as a "conditionally
stable" system.’

The MSRE analysis is complicated further by the complexity of the
feedback loop H, which represents the reactivity effects due to fuel and
graphite temperature changes resulting from changes in nuclear power. A
more detailed breakdown of the components of H is given in Fig. 14. This
core thermal model has two inputs, the nuclear power N and core inlet tem-
perature T.5» and three outputs, nuclear average fuel and graphite tem-
peratures 8 and Ta and the core outlet temperature Too The block "Ex-
ternal Loops" represents the primary loop external to the core, the heat
exchanger, the secondary ‘loop, and the radiator. All the parameters are
treated as perturbation quantities or deviations from their steady-state
values. Also the radiator air flow rate is adjusted so that with a given
steady-state power level, the core outlet temperature is 1225°F. This
means that the feedback loop transfer function H also varies with power
level. i |

If we look at the effect of perturbations in power, N, on the core
inlet temperature, T,;» We can see that the effects of different air flow
rates are only apparent at low frequencies, as in Fig. 15, which shows
the Bode plots for T,/N at Ng = 1 and 10 Mv. Tt is important to note
that at low power and at low frequency, the magnitude of the temperature

change is large, and it lags the input N considerably. For example,

at No = 1 Mv and w = 0.0005 radians/sec, the magnitude ratio is 170°F/Mw
and the phase lag is 80°. The block diagram of Fig. 14 indicates that

the nuclear average temperature perturbations in TX and Tg can be con-
sidered to be caused by the two separate inputs N and Tose For example,
the open-loop transfer function TX/N (with Tos constant) is 5.0°F/Mw at
steady state, and there is little attenuation and phase lag up to rela-
tively high frequencies; as in Fig. 16, which shows the open-loop transfer
functions of the nuclear average temperatures as functions of N and Tose
Returning to the example case of Ng = 1 Mw and w = 0.0005 radians/sec,

we note that the prompt feedback effect of 5°F/Mw from T#/N is very small
compared with temperature changes of the entire system represented by a
Toy /N of 170°F/Mw at —80°. (Note that T/T; = 1.0 at 0.0005 radians/sec.)
The important point here is that for low power levels over a wide range

of low frequencies, the large gain of the frequency response of overall
system temperature relative to power dominates the feedback loop H, and
its phase angle approaches —90°.

The no-feedback curve in Fig. 9 shows that at frequencies below about
0.005 radians/sec, the forward-loop transfer function N/8k (open loop)
also has a phase approaching —90° and a gain curve with a —1 slope (i.e.,
one-decade attenuation per decade increase in frequency). With both G
and H having phase angles approaching —90°, the phase of the product GH
will approach =180°. If the magnitude ratio of G were such that lea} = 1.0
under these conditions, the system would approach instability. From the
Bode plot of Fig. 9, it can be seen thet at a power of 0.1 Mw, |GH| s 1.0
at 0.0045 radians/sec (22 min/cycle), since the peak in the closed-loop

occurs there. At lower powers and consequently lower gains G, lau] ap-

proaches 1.0 at even lower frequencies, where the phase of GH is closer
to —180°. This accounts for the less stable conditions at the lower

) powers and lower frequencies.

At the higher powers, |GHI approaches 1.0 at higher frequencies

where the effect of the prompt thermal feedback is significant. For ex-

“ample, the peak in the 10-Mw closed-loop Bode plot of N/ok, Fig. 9, occurs

at 0.078 radians/sec. At this frequency, lz ./Nl has a value of 2.0
(Fig. 15) compared with a T%/N of 4.4 at =15° (Fig. 16). Consequently,
the prompt fuel temperature feedback term has a dominant stabilizing effect.

The relative importances of the various components of feedback re-
activity are shown in the directed-line diagrams of Fig. 17 for power
levels of 1 and 10 Mw and at the frequencies at which the oscillations
occur. The vectors labeled —Bk, and —Bk, represent the products of the
nuclear temperature components and the reactivity coefficients that re-
sult from a unit vector input Bk, The vectors labeled "prompt" are
the effects due to the nuclear power input based on no change in core
inlet temperature. Those labeled "loop" are caused by changes in core

inlet temperature alone. For example:

The net 8k vector is the sum of the input and feedback vectors. For the
1-Mw case, dk net is greater than Bk, 3 this indicates regenerative feed-
back and shows up on the closed-loop Bode plot (Fig. 9) as a peak with a
greater magnitude ratio than that of the no-feedback curve.

The increased stabilizing effect of the prompt fuel temperature term
in going from 1 to 10 Mw is also evident. These plots clearly show the
diminished effect of the graphite at the higher frequency.

In both cases, too, the plots show that a more negative graphite

temperature coefficient would tend to increase the net 8k vector and

“hence destabilize the system.

Interpretation of Early Results

The previously published ‘results of a dynamic study performed in
1961 predicted that the MSRE would be less stable than is predicted in
this study. This is partly because of differences in design parameters

- and partly because of differences in the models used. These differences

were reviewed in Section 4 of this report.

The most significant parameter changes from 1961 to 1965 were the
values for the fuel and graphite temperature coefficients of reactivity
and the changes in the fuel heat capacity. Table 1 (Sect. 4) shows that
the new fuel coefficient is more negative, the new graphite coefficient
is less negative, and the fuel heat capacity is smaller than was thought
to be the case in 1961. All these changes contribute to. the more stable
behavior calculated with the current data. (The destabilizing effect of
a more negative graphite temperature coefficient is discussed in Section
7.) }

The most important change, however, is the use of a multiregion core
model and the calculation of the nuclear aversge temperature. In the
single-region core, T¥* is equal to the temperature of the first of the

F
two fuel lumps or the average core temperature (in steady state). In

‘the nine-region core, T¥* is computed by multiplying each of the 18 fuel-

¥
lump temperatures by a nuclear importance factor, I. In the single-

region model, the steady-state value of TX/N (with Toi constant) is only
2.8°F/Mw compared with 5.0°F/Mw for the nine-region core model. This
difference occurs because in the nine-region model, the downstream fuel-
lump temperatures are affected not only by the power input to that lump
but also by the change in the lump's inlet temperature due to heating of
the upstream lumps. This point may be illustrated by noting the differ-
ence between two single-region models, where in one case the nuclear im-
portance of the first lump is 1.0 and in the other case the importance

of each lump is 0.5. As an example, say the core outlet temperature in-

. creases 5°F/Mw. The change in TX for a 1-Mw input would be

ATE =I, ATy + Ip ATy

In the first case Tp = 1.0 and ATy = 2.5°F, 50 ATE = 2.5°F. In the sec-
ond case, I = Ip = 0.5, ATy = 2.5°F, ‘and AT, = 5°F, so AT = 3.75°F, or

a 50% greater change than in casé one. For many more lumps, this effect

is even greater.

As wes shown above; ‘the prompt ‘fuel reactivity feedback effect was

the dominant stabilizing mechanism at both 1 and 10 Mw, so the original

single-region core model would give pessimistic results.

7. Perturbations in the Model and the Design Parameters

Every mathematical analysis of a physical system is subject to some
uncertainty because of two questions: How good is the mathematical model,
and how accurate are the values of the parameters used in the model? The
influence of changes in the assumed model were therefore investigated,
and the sensitivity to parameter variations of the results based on both
the reduced and complete models was determined. An analysis was also
performed to determine the worst expected stability performance within

the estimated range of uncertainty of the system parameters.

Effects of Model Changes

 

The effects of changing the mathematical model of the system were
determined by comparing the phase margins with the reference case as
each part of the model was changed in turn. The following changes were
made: a
1. Core Representation. A single-region core model was used in-
stead of the nine-region core used in the complete model.

2. Delayed-Neutron Groups. A single delayed-neutron group was
used instead of the six-group representation in the complete model.

3. Fixed Effective B's. The usual constant-delay-fraction delayed-
neutron equations were used with an effective delay fraction, B, for each
precursor. The effective B was obtained by calculating the delayed-
neutron contribution that is reduced due to fluid flow in the steady-
state case. This is in contrast to the explicit treatment of dynamic
circulation effects in the complete model (see Appendix A).

4. First-Order Transport Lags. The Laplace transform of a pure
delay, eS, was used in the complete model. The first-order well-
stirred-tank approximation, — was used in the modified model.

5. Single-Section Heat Exchanger and Radiator. A single section
was used to represent the heat exchanger and radiator rather than the
ten-section representation in the complete model.

~ 6. Xenon. The xenon equations were omitted in contrast to the ex-

plicit xenon treatment in the complete model.

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

35

The results are shown in Table 4. The only significant effect is
that due to a change in the core model. The results for the one-region
core model indicate considerably less stability than for the nine-region
core model. This difference is due primarily to the different way in
which the nuclear average temperature of the fuel is calculated, as was

discussed in detail in Section 6.

Effects of Parameter Changes

© Frequency-response sensitivities and pole sensitivities were cal-

‘culated. Frequency-response sensitivities are defined as fractional

changes in magnitude or phase per fractional change ina system parameter.

The magnitude frequency-response sensitivities were calculated for sev-
eral important parameters with the MSFR code (see Appendix C) for the

complete model. The sensitivities were obtained by differences between

 

 
 

36

the results of calculations at the design point and those of calculations

with a single parameter changed slightly. The results of these calcu-

- lations are shown in Fig.

18. Calculations were also performed on the

system with the reduced model with a new computer code called SFR (Sensi-

tivity of the Frequency Response). This code calculates magnitude and

phase sensitivities for a

general system by matrix methods. This calcu-

lation was restricted to the reduced system representation because of

the large cost of calculations for very large matrices. The results of

this calculation are given in Fig. 19. In Figs. 18 and 19, a positive

sensitivity indicates that a decrease in the system parameter will de- -

crease the magnitude of the frequency response. The situation is re-

versed for negative sensitivities.

‘The sensitivities shown in Figs. 18 and 19 can be used to estimate

the effects of possible future updating of the MSRE design parameters
used in this study. In addition, they support other general observations

obtained by other means.

For instance, Fig. 19 shows that the sensitivi-

ties to loop effects, such as primary and secondary loop transit times,

are important relative to

core effects. This indicates that the external

loops strongly influence the system dynamics, as was concluded in Sec-

tion 6.

Similar information may be obtained from pole sensitivities (or

eigenvalue sensitivities).

These are defined as the fractional change

fractional change in a system parameter. The

sensitivity of the dominant pole (the pole whose position in the complex

plane determines the main

characteristics of the dynamic behavior) is

usually the only one of interest.

The dominant pole sensitivities for a number of system parameters

are shown in Table 5 for power levels of 1 and 10 Mw. These results may
be used to estimate the effect of future updating of the MSRE design

parameters, and they also

furnish some insight as to the causes of the

calculated dynamic behavior. For instance, it is noted that the sensi-

tivity to changes in the graphite temperature coefficient is only about

one-fourteenth the sensitivity to changes in the fuel temperature coef-

om

ficient at 10 Mw. At 1 Mw, the graphite effect is about one-third as QO

large as the fuel effect.

This indicates that a decrease in power level

causes modifications in the dynamic behavior that accentuate the relative
effect of graphite temperature feedback. It is also noted that the vari-
ous heat transfer coefficients have a much larger relative effect at 1 Mv
than at 10 Mw; this indicates that the coupling between system components

has a larger influence at low power than at high power.

Effects of Design Uncertainties

A new method!® for automatically finding the least stable condition
in the range of uncertainty in the design parameters was used. A com=
puter code for the IBM-7090 was used for the calculations. The method
is described in some detail in Appendix D. The least stable. condition
is found by using the steepest-ascent (or gradient-projection) method of
nonlinear programming.

The quantity that is maximized is the real part of the dominant pole
of the system transfer function (or equivalently, the dominant eigenvalue
of the system matrix). Less stable conditions are accompanied by less
negative values for the real part of the dominant pole, and instability
is accompanied by a pole with a positive real part. The maximization
involves a step-wise determination of the particular combination of sys-
tem parameters within the uncertainty range that causes the real part of
the dominant pole to have its least negative value. If the maximized
pole has a negative real part, instability is not possible in the uncer-
tainty range. If the maximized pole has a positive real part, instability
is possible in the uncertainty range if all the system parameters deviate
from the design point in a particular way.

A key factor in the stability extrema analysis is the availability
of the appropriate ranges to assign to the system parameters. The ranges
appropriate for the MSRE were furnished by Engel.*7 It was decided to
use a wide range on the importent nuclear parameters (neutron lifetime,
fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity, and graphite temperature co-
efficient of reactivity). These parameters were allowed to range between
two-thirds and three-halves of the design values. All other ranges were
assigned by considering the method of evaluating them and the probable
effects of aging in-the reactor environment. The ranges of the 16 system

parameters chosen for this study are given in Table 6.

The reduced model was used with current parameters for locating the
least stable condition in the uncertainty range. This gave results at
a much lower cost than with a more complete model. This wes considered
adequate because other calculations showed that the reduced model predicts
lower stability than the complete model. The reasons for this were ex-
plored in Section 6. Experience with other calculations also showed that
changes in system paremeters gave qualitatively the same type of changes
in the system performance with either model.

The set of parameters for the least stable condition is listed in
Table 7. The least negative value of the dominant eigenvalue calculated
with the reduced model changes from (—0.0187 + 0.0474 j) sec” at the de-
sign point to (—0.00460 + 0.0330 j) sec” at the worst condition for 10
Mw. For 1 Mw, the change is from (—0.00182 # 0.0153 j) sec” to
(+0.000574 * 0.0134 j) sec=®. This indicates that instability is im-
possible in the uncertainty range at 10 Mw but that the reduced model
predicts an instability at 1 Mw for a combination of parameters within
the uncertainty range. This condition gives a transient with a doubling
time of about 1/2 hr and a period of oscillation of about 8 min per cycle.

It is evident that the calculated instability at the extreme case
for 1 Mw is due to the inherent pessimism of the reduced model (see Sect.
6). This was verified by using the MSFR code for the complete model with
the parameters describing the extreme case. It was found that the phase
margin for 10 Mw was 75° for the extreme condition (versus 99° for ‘the
design condition), and the phase margin for 1 Mw was 21° for the extreme
condition (versus 41° for the design condition). Thus, it is concluded
that the best available methods indicate that the MSRE will be stable
throughout the expected range of system parameters.

8. Conclusions

This study indicates that the MSRE will be inherently stable for =211
operating conditions. Low-power transients without control will persist
for a long time, but they will eventually die out because of inherent
feedback. Other studies have shown that this sluggish response at low

sients rapidly.

The theoretical treatment used in this study included all known
effects that were considered to be capable of significantly influencing
the system dynamics. Even so, for safety and also for obtaining basic
reactor information, system stability will be checked experimentally in
dynamic tests, which will begin with zero power and which will continue

through full-power operation.

Multiregion Core
The overall transfer functions for an axisl section of core consist-
ing of several regions in series are. complicated by the fact that the in-
puts to the upper (or downstream) regions are affected by the response
of the lower regions. A block diagram illustrating the coupling in terms
of the transfer functions H_,(s) is shown in Fig. A.1l.

W = mass flow rate, 1b/sec.

Since it is the radiator air flow rate that is varied to change the
load demand, the radiator shell-side coefficients will vary with power
level. The coefficients listed in Appendix B are for a 197-1b/sec air
flow rate, corresponding to 10-Mw power removel at design temperatures.
In all the studies, h was varied as the 0.6 power of the flow rate,

air
and W , as the first power.

- Appendix C. General Description of MSRE
Frequency-Response Code

 

The MSRE frequency-response code (MSFR) is written in FORTRAN IV
language for the IBM 7090 computers at the Oak Ridge Central Dats Pro-
cessing Facility. This language has builtin capabilities for handling
complex algebra that result in considerable savings of programming effort.

MSFR uses transfer function techniques (rather than matrix methods)
to compute frequency response. It exploits the fact that a reactor sys-
tem is made up of separate components, each having a certain number of
inputs and outputs, which tie in with adjacent components. The subrou-
tines written for each subsystem were useful in other reactor and process
dynamics calculations. The MAIN program of MSFR performs input, output,
and supervisory chores, and calls the subroutines. A subroutine called
CLOSED must be written to compute the desired closed-loop transfer func-
tions from .the component transfer functions.

The transfer function approach has several advantages over the ma-
trix methods:

1. Input parameters are the physical coefficients of the subsys-
tems, rather than sums and differences. This not only makes generating
input data easy, it allows the computer to carry out the sum-difference-
type arithmetic internally. Several matrix type computations for which
the matrix coefficients were generated "carefully" with long slide rules
resulted in large errors in the frequency response.

2. The frequency response Of distributed-parameter models can be
computed exactly with MSFR, while most matrix calculations are limited
to lumped-parameter models.- oo |

3. MSFR calculations are much faster. The 7090 can put out between

-1000 ‘and 2000 frequency-response points per minute for the complete

model. Typical running times for current matrix calculations are much
longer. Le Lo |
The matrix technique has the advantages that special programming

is not required for each different problem, and no algebraic manipulations

of the equations are required. Also, matrix manipulations can be used

 
72

for optimization calculations, eigenvalue calculations, time-response
calculations, and possibly many others, all with the same input data.

The advantages of both methods were exploited in this study.

The following subroutines of MSFR have potential as generally use-
ful packages:

1. PWR; which calculates the frequency response (N/5k) of the
nuclear kinetics equations for up to six groups of precursors, with an
option for including circulating precursor dynamics.

2. CLMP, which computes the frequency response of a "typical" core
region (as noted in Appendix A). Inputs are power and inlet temperature,
and outputs are outlet temperature, nuclear average temperatures, and Bk.

3. CORY, which calculates the overall frequency responses of the
MSRE nine-lump core model using CLMP outputs. oo

4. LHEX, which calculates the transfer functions of a lumped-
parameter heat exchanger (as in Appendix A), with an input option for

Each of these closed-loop equations can be written as a single
FORTRAN IV statement, so it is a simple matter to generate different
functions. An option is also available in MSFR to print out all the
internal or component transfer functions. FORTRAN IV listings, decks,
and input information may be obtained from S. J. Ball.

Appendix D. Stability Extrema Calculation

For a linear description of a reactor system, the eigenvalues of
the system matrix must all have negative real parts for stability. A
techniquel® was developed that systematically seeks out the combination
of system parameters that causes the least stable condition in the
feasible range (causes the dominant eigenvalue to become as positive as
possible). This technique utilizes a form of the gradient-projection
method to explore the hypersurface that defines the stability index (the
negativeness of the real part of the dominant eigenvalue) as a function
of the system parameters. The upper and lower limits on the expected
ranges of system parameters constitute constraint surfaces that limit
the area of search on the performance hypersurface.

The real part of the dominant eigenvalue is labeled 8. The change

in B due to small changes in the system parameters, Xs is given by

dB = VBdX = |v] Jax | cos 0 , (p.1)
where
dB = incremental change in B,
oB J
vB = ex by + ep £- Foeee

dX = e; dx3 + €3 4X3 + «ea ,

a unit vector,

e,
i
8

angle between the vectors.

Thus the maximum change in B occurs when 6 = O; that is, the changes
in the system parameters are in the same vector direction as the gradient
vector. It is therefore expected that the greatest change in 8 will
occur when the system parameters change in proportion to their corre-

sponding elements in the gradient vector:

ax, = 7 %- s | | (p.2)

l

 
 

76

where 7 is a real positive coefficient whose magnitude is chosen to
insure that constraints are satisfied.

It is clear that the calculated values of the components of VP are
the key quantities in implementation of this method. The method for
finding VB can be developed from the characteristic equation for the

system given in determinant form:

p=la-s1|=0, (0.3)

where

A = the systém matrix,
8 = an eigenvalue of A,
IT = the unit diagonal matrix.

We now write D with some arbitrary eigenvalue, Spr factored out:

D={(s— 8,) F(s) = 0, (D.4)

where F(s) is a nonzero determinant if Sy is a simple eigenvalue. We
differentiate Eq. (D.4) with respect to an element, a, # of the matrix,

A, and with respect to s:

oD OF(s) ds,
s— = (5-5) 57 Fs) 3p » ~ (p.5)

®1 #13 "13 |
D = (s -— 8) ors + ?(s) . (D.6)

We then evaluate Eqs. (D.5) and (D.6) for s = s, and take their ratio to
get Eq. (D.7):

dD
ds, 2p les,
%.,, = e~ 01 . (0.7)

The derivative, 3p/3e., ig is just the cofactor of a, 13 in [A — sI],
and OD/ds is the negative of the sum of the cofactors of diagonal ele-
ments of [A — sI]. Thus Eq. (D.5) may be written

0s, Cc Co
% = Ta . (p.8)
Y, Cer

f=1 -
If we choose 8) to be the least negative eigenvalue, the real part of

8) is just B. Since 8 3 is real, we may write
»B c, |

oc Re bP . (p.9)

f=1

The derivative with respect to a system parameter, x), is easily ob-
tained from Eq. (D.9), since the following relation holds:

» LB
CLE
ij Ti Tt

We use this in Eq. (D.9) to obtain

 

B 1 n day
14 ‘eo i=1
£f j=l

The usefulness of Eq. (D.10) rests on the ability to calculate the
system eigenvalue, 8, to give [A — 8 Le This may be readily accom-
plished by using one of the standard E genvalue computation methods,

such as Parlett's method® or the QR method.l#

The cofactors in Eq. (D.10) could be calculated directly with a
method such as Gaussian eliminstion., However, this tedious procedure may
be circumvented by application of a useful theorem from matrix algebra.

 
 

78

It is known that the cofactors of parallel lines in a matrix with order

n and rank n — 1 are proportional.Z° Since [A — 8,11 is a matrix with
these properties, the cofactor calculation may be simplified. For in-
stance, if the cofactors of the first row and first column of [A — 5,1]
are calculated, all other cofactors are given by

C,, C :
Cc. =i 13 (D.11)

ij C1

Use of Eq. (D.11) to find the cofactors shown in Eq. (D.10) gives a prec-
tical method for finding the derivatives 3/dx, needed to carry out the
gradient-projection step shown in Eq. (D.2).

Gradient methods are useful for finding local extrema for nonlinear
problems. However, it may be possible for the surface of B versus sys-
tem parameters to have many peaks. The only technique currently suitable
for handling this provlem is to use multiple starts. The computer code
developed to implement this method is set up to use multiple starts au-~
tomatically.

The procedure for carrying out the maximization from a given base
point is to recalculate the eigenvalues for several new parameter sets
specified by steps out the gradient vector. The point that gives the
system with the largest value of Bp is then used as a new starting point.
This is repeated until a maximum within the constrained set of system

parameters is found.
