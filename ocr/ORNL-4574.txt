MOLTEN-SALT FLUORIDE VOLATILITY PILOT PLANT: RECOVERY OF
ENRICHED URANIUM FROM ALUMINUM-CLAD FUEL ELEMENTS

ABSTRACT

We have developed and successfully demonstrated a molten-
salt fluoride-volatility process for recovering decontaminated
uranium from spent uranium-aluminum alloy ORR and LITR fuel
elements clad in aluminum. The facilities and the process
were essentially the same as those used for zirconium- and
Zircaloy-clad fuels except that an aluminum-potassium-zirconium
fluoride mixture was used as the carrier salt. The development
program included the processing of both unirradiated and irrad-
iated fuel elements. Fission product decontamination factors
(fuel to UFg product) for the UFg products in the four hot runs
were generally 10% to 1010, The uranium concentration in the
salt after fluorination ranged from less than 0.1 to 9 ppm;
total nonrecoverable losses in scrubbers and waste salt averaged
less than 0.9%. Dissolution of the fuel elements required 8
to 17 hr for 90% completion, and 12 to 25 hr for 100% comple-
tion; average dissolution rates were 0.6 and 0.4 kg of aluminum/
hr, respectively. The release of fission products to the atmos-
phere during the first three hot runs was confined to 120 mCi
of technetium, 5 mCi of ruthenium (which occurred in one run),
Wndetectable amounts of !31I, and 47 to 60 Ci (calculated) of

Kr.

In the fourth run, an ORR element that had been cooled
less than four weeks was processed. Radiation exposures to
personnel were controlled within tolerable limits. The de-
contamination factors (DF's) in this run ranged from 2 x 10°
to 108. Two major exceptions were the DF's for 9%Mo and
125gy, which were 36 and about 500 respectively. The product
had a high radioactivity level due to the presence of 37y.
The uranium concentration in the selt after fluorination in
this run was approximately 0.1 ppm, and the total nonrecov-
erable loss was 0.4%. In the short-cooled run (RA-L4), 24 Ci
of 85Kr and 2260 Ci of 133Xe (calculated) were released to
the atmosphere during hydrofluorination; 20 Ci of technetium,
along with barely detecteble amounts of 1311 (102 ci)
and ruthenium (10-3 Ci), were released during fluorination.
The 85Kr and 133Xe were released over an extended period so
that actual ground-level concentrations did not exceed a
small fraction of the maximum permissible concentrations
(MPC's) at any time.
 

 

 

 

1. INTRODUCTION

At ORNL, uranium-zirconium alloy fuels containing highly enriched
urenium and irradiated to burnups of 32% have been successfully pro-
cessed, using the molten-salt fluoride-volatility process, after cooling
periods as short as six months. * However, the anticipated quantity of
spent uranium-zirconium alloy fuel is insufficient to justify a molten
salt-fluoride volatility processing plant. To be economically practi-
cal, such a plant would have to be capable of processing other types of

nuclear reactor fuel as well.

In order to provide a larger processing load (and thereby improve
plant economics) for a molten-salt fluoride-volatility plant, a devel-
opment program was undertasken to extend the use of the volatility pro-
cess mentioned above to the decontamination and recovery of unburned
uranium in uranium-aluminum alloy (U-A1) fuel elements. This program
culminated in the processing of highly enriched fuels, with approxi-
mately 30% of the initial 235U fissioned, within 25 days of discharge
from a reactor operating at a flux of greater than 2 x 101% neutrons
=2 -1

Five cold runs and four hot runs were made in the Volatility Pilot
Plant* (VPP) at ORNL. In the first two cold runs, multiplate aluminum
dummy fuel elements were dissolved; dummy fuel and unirradiated UF,
were processed in the remaining three cold runs. In the hot runs, fuel
from the Low Intensity Test Reactor (LITR) and the Oak Ridge Research
Reactor (ORR) was processed after cooling periods ranging from less
than 30 days to 18 months. The hot runs were followed by an additional
dummy dissolution, four barren salt flushes, aqueous decontamination,

corrosion measurements, and, finally, equipment sectioning.

The purpose of this report is to present the information obtained
in the VPP runs; primary emphasis is on the four hot runs (LITR fuel
cooled 18 months and ORR fuel cooled 6 months, 3 months, and 25 days
respectively). The molten-salt fluoride-volatility flowsheet and a

summary of the operational experience and results for the processing

of aluminum-base fuels in the VPP are included. The irradiation his-
tories of the fuel elements that were dissolved, the compositions of
the molten salts employed, and the two principal chemical reaction steps
of hydrofluorination and fluorination are discussed in detail. Special
attention is given to the distribution and release of fission products.
Data regarding the purity of the UFg products, the nonrecoverable uran-
ium losses, the uranium and salt balances, and the radiation experience
(radiation intensity measurements as well as personnel exposures) are
also presented. Equipment design and performance, and operating proce-
dures that differ from those used in the earlier zirconium program, are
described elsevhere.” Complete discussions of equipment and procedures
in the zirconium progrem may also be found elsewhere, 1s3>
In this report, the molten-salt fluoride-volatility process as
applied to U-Al fuels is referred to as "the volatility process," even
though it is only one of many volatility processes. This particular
volatility process essentially consists of four steps: (1) dissolution
of fuel elements in a molten fluoride salt, by reaction with anhydrous
HF, to produce UF, and AlFj3; (2) removal and partial decontamination of
the uranium by fluorination with fluorine, which converts the UF, to
UFgs (3) further purification of the UFg by passage through beds of NaF
and MgF, pellets, utilizing sorption and desorption techniques; and
(4) recovery of the UFg product by solid-phase condensation. A more

detailed description of the process follows in the next section.

2. DESCRIPTION OF THE MOLTEN-SALT VOLATILITY FLOWSHEET

A simplified schematic diagram, or flowsheet, of the equipment
used in the VPP is shown in Fig. 2.1. In accordance with this flowsheet,
each irradiated fuel element was brought into the pilot plant in the
shielded carrier-charger (FV-9501). The carrier-charger was centered
over the charging chute, and the multiplate element was lowered (by a
zirconium wire) directly into the 5-in.-diam bottom section of the
dissolver (FV-1000), where it rested on the distributor plate. In

most instances, a second element was placed on top of the first. The

K-Zr-Al fluoride salt was mixed as a powder, added to the barren salt
transfer tank (FV-1500), melted (mp = ~600°C), sampled, and transferred
to the dissolver (also called the hydrofluorinator), which had been pre-
heated to 600-650°C.

Anydrous HF was distilled batchwise into the system through the
HF cooler (FV-2004) to the HF accumulator (FV-1006). A stream of li-
quid HF was pumped from the accumulator to the HF vapor generator
(FV-1207), where it was vaporized; the vapor was superheated to 100°C,
metered, and fed to the dissolver beneath the distributor plate. The
HF dissolved in the salt and reacted with the elements to produce
AlF3 and UF, (which became part of the melt), and hydrogen. The hydro-
gen, unreacted HF vapor, and inert gases from instrument purges left
the dissolver and entered the flash cooler (FV-100l1), where they con-
tacted a second stream of liquid HF pumped from the HF accumulator.
Solids that had been entrained from the dissolver were removed here,
in the condenser (FV-2001), and in the HF catch tank (FV-1003). Solids
that collected in the catch tank remained there until the end of the
dissolution step, when the contents of the tank were transferred to
the caustic neutralizer (FV~1009). In turn, the contents of the neu-
tralizer were pumped to the hot chemical waste. The HF was distilled
from the HF reboiler (FV-1005), and was collected in the HF accumulator
after passing through filter FV-T001C and the HF cooler. The hydrogen
and inert gases passed through the -50°C HF condenser (FV-2005), which
removed traces of HF, and were then bubbled through approximately 2 M
KOH in the caustic neutralizer. This off-gas stream then joined the
cell off-gas stream, received another caustic scrub, passed through
absolute filters (AEC type), and was then released to the atmosphere
through the 3020 stack.

After dissolution was complete (i.e., there was no further decrease
in off-gas volume or HF inventory),the HF recirculation was stopped,
and the melt was sparged with nitrogen to remove the dissolved HF. The
molten salt (mp = 550°C) was then transferred to the fluorinator
(FV-100), which had been preheated to approximately 600°C; enough salt

was left behind to fill the horizontal section of the connecting line
 

 

 

and thus form a plug,or "freeze valve, to separate the hydrofluorina-

tion equipment and the fluorination equipment.

The fluorinator was sparged with nitrogen to mix the new charge
with any "heel" that remained from the previous run, and then the salt
was sampled by lowering a copper ladle (on a chain) directly into the
molten salt and "dipping" a small volume from beneath the surface of
the melt. From such a "feed salt" sample, the uranium and fission
product concentrations after hydrofluorination @nd before fluorination)
could be determined. After the sampling procedure was complete, ele-
mental fluorine was passed through the melt to convert the UFy to UFg
and to thereby remove it from the melt. The only important higher
fluorides of fission products that were formed during fluorination and

were not retained by NaF were MoFg, TeFg, and TcFg.

Fluorine at 12 to 60 psig was supplied by a tank trailer parked
outside Bldg. 3019; it entered through a NaF trap (inlet end heated to
100°C), which removed HF. The purified fluorine flowed into the fluori-
nator through a draft tube, which induced circulation of the melt and
improved gas-liquid contacting. Volatile UFg, volatile fission product
fluorides, and unreacted fluorine passed out of the fluorinator through
the movable bed absorber (FV-105); the higher fluorides of most of the
fission products are nonvolatile, and they remained in the salt. This
gas stream passed, first, through a section of the movable bed absorber
containing NaF pellets at 400°C. Here, the bulk of the fission product
fluorides that were volatilized or entrained were deposited; the Fj,
essentially all of the U, Mo, Np, and Te, and significant quantities of
Zr, Nb, Ru, I,, and Te proceeded to the next section containing NaF
pellets at 150°C. The UFg and most of the conteminants were sorbed
under these conditions, while the fluorine, MoFg, and some tellurium
fluorides passed on to the chemical trap (FV-121), which contained NaF
at ambient temperature. The MoFg and any traces of UFg were removed
by this trap. Fluorine was removed in a caustic scrubber (FV-150).

The off-gas was then vented to the cell off-gas system (which included
another caustic scrubber) and was filtered before being exhausted.

Generally, a small amount of tellurium was released in the off-gas.
=}

[3]

+)

Desorption of UFg (but not fission products) from the 150°C NaF
pellets in the movable bed absorber was achieved by heating to 400°C
in a fluorine sweep. This gas stream passed, first, through the
impurity trap (FV-120), containing MgF, at 100°C, for the removal of
any technetium and neptunium present and, then, through the product
filter (FV-723) into the small product cylinder (FV-223) maintained
at -70°C by dry ice--trichloroethylene slush. About TO to 100% of the
UFg was removed; the remainder was deposited in the UFg cold traps
(FV-220 and FV-222) held at -50 to -60°C. The off-gas exited through
the chemical trap (FV-121) to remove any traces of uranium and then
passed to the caustic scrubber as previously. After HF had been
flashed from the UFg product under vacuum at 0°C, the small product
cylinder was removed from the system, weighed, sampled, and assayed

to confirm weight, composition, and enrichment of the product.

After fluorination, the melt in the fluorinator was sampled to
determine the degree of removal of UF, from the salt. Analytical re-
sults were received (usually <3 pg of uranium per gram of salt) before
a portion of the NaF pellets from the LO0°C section of the movable bed
absorber was dumped into the fluorinator. In the event that the uran-
ium concentration was higher than desired, the fluorination could be

continued until an acceptable value of residual uranium was obtained.

The NaF pellets that were transferred to the fluorinastor were
from the lower section (400°C) of the absorber; since these pellets
were the first to be contacted by the fluorination off-gas, they had
the highest concentration of sorbed fission products. The salt was
sparged with nitrogen to aid in the pellet dissolution; then another
waste salt sample was taken to determine the amount of uranium held
by the pellets. After this uranium analysis (usually <8 ppm) was
received, the waste salt was transferred to a waste salt can (FV-112)
located inside a shielded carrier. Enough salt was left in ‘the trans-
fer line to form a freeze valve, as was done for the molten salt line
between the dissolver and fluorinator. After cooling, the waste salt
carrier was transported to the burial ground, where the waste salt can

was dropped into an underground vault for long-term storage.
 

 

3. PREPARATION OF THE K-Zr-Al FLUORIDE DISSOLVENT SALTS

The ternary salt KF-ZrF,-AlFj was considered for the dissolvent in

> had shown

the aluminum cempaign in the VPP since Thoma, Sturm, and Guinn
it to be the most suitable solvent system for the processing of alumi- |
num-urenium fuels. The use of this salt would permit us to operate at
relatively low temperatures, thus minimizing corrosion and avoiding

the difficulties that would otherwise result from the low melting point

(660°C) of aluminum.

A portion of the revised triangular plot of liquidus temperature
as a function of composition for the system KF-ZrFy-AlF3 is shown in
Fig. 3.1. This portion includes the only region with melting points
less than 600°C. It is easily seen that any dissolution path (e.g.,
heavy, ‘dashed lines) that is chosen to maximize capacity will start at
the maximum allowable melting point, cross a region of lower melting
point, and terminate at the maximum melting point that is allowable
during fluorination. Obviously, the higher the temperature that can
be tolerated, the greater the capacity of the salt for eluminum. A
maximum melting point of 600°C was chosen for the beginning salt. This
permitted operation at a temperature slightly above the melting point,
and still allowed for a reasonable temperature rise (due to reaction
heat) without attaining the melting point of aluminum. The melting
point at the end of dissolution was held to 550°C to limit the corro-

sive effect of elemental fluorine on the nickel fluorinator.

For all four hot runs, barren salt containing 64.3 to 63.0 mole
% KF and 35.7 to 37.0 mole % ZrFy (mp, 600°C) was transferred to the
hydrofluorinator. These salts, when mixed with the small "heels"
carried over in the hydrofluorinator, gave the desired initial composi-
tions. The binary salts were prepared by dry-mixing commercial grades
of K,ZrF, (containing 27% potassium and 32.1% zirconium, by weight) and
ZrFy (54 to 54.5% zirconium). The granular salts and mixtures were
handled in air; no special precautions were taken, except that a rea-
sonable effort was made to minimize the time during which the salt was

exposed to moisture.

The mixture was melted in a closed vessel; a nitrogen purge was
maintained through the vapor space, and a nitrogen sparge was used to
promote mixing when melting began. There was no evidence (thermal) of
H20 evolution at any temperature, although the odor of HF was quite
evident. The melt was clear and had a low viscosity; transfer of the

barren salt into the system was accomplished without difficulty.

Although the binary salt just described provided a highly satis-
factory starting material for processing U-Al fuels, we wanted to de-
monstrate dissolution with a salt initially containing aluminum. The
aluminum could easily be supplied by leaving an aluminum-rich heel in
the hydrofluorinator. The remainder of the charge would then consist
of K,ZrFg and KF; the substitution of low-cost KF for ZrF, would greatly
reduce the cost of the salt components. Although the addition of solid
KoZrFg-KF, as outlined, could not be done in VPP equipment because of
design limitations, partial transfer (i.e., terminating a molten salt
transfer at a specified point) had been demonstrated during the zir-

conium campaign.

We encountered difficulty in all early attempts to prepare a ter-
nary Kp-ZrF,-AlFj3 barren salt. Although salt materials (i.e., commer-
cial KpZrFg and KF, and specially-dried AlF3) were carefully pre-mixed,
fusion was always incomplete. A sediment, having the consistency of
coarse sand, was evident in the bottom of the melt vessel, while a
layer of undissolved material floated on the surface of the melts,

When the ternary phase diagram (liquidus temperature vs composition)

was examined, revised data showed that these melts had liquidus tempera-
tures about 85°C higher than those indicated by the former triangular
plot. However, mixtures whose compositions had been adjusted to the
data of the new diagram exhibited the same characteristics. Although
the dissolvent salt could not be fused completely, experiments showed
that the product salt, after aluminum dissolution and HF sparging, was

a single-phase melt and could be transferred readily in the liquid
state. Hence, for initial operations in the VPP, the ternary salt

was prepared by mixing, melting as much as was possible, allowing the

salt to freeze, and breaking the frozen salt into chunks of
«)

11

non-homogeneous solid. These chunks were then dropped into the dissol-
ver. This experimental procedure was used only for cold runs (liquid
binary salt was used in the hot runs); it was reasonably satisfactory
for cold runs, but would be hazardous if used to charge a highly con-

taminated hydrofluorinator.

After the last run in which irradiated fuel was processed (RA-Y4),
a cleanout run was made using a dummy aluminum element. In the latter
run, & molten KF-ZrFu-AlFj3 ternary salt was transferred successfully
into the system. The target composition was 63-21-16 mole % KF-ZrF,-AlF3,
which was thought to be the composition of a ternary eutectic with the
lowest-melting salt in the immediate area of interest. Heating to
650°C appeared to clarify the melt; however, a few inches of sediment
was found in the bottom of the melt vessel. When ZrF, was added, to
increase the ZrF, content to 22.33 mole %, the sediment disappeared.
It did not reappear upon cooling to 600°C. Thus the final composition
of the barren salt that was transferred into the system was 61.94-22,33-
15.73 mole % KF-ZrF,-AlFj.

4. DESCRIPTIVE DATA FOR THE IRRADIATED U-Al FUEL ELEMENTS
PROCESSED IN RUNS RA-1, -2, -3, AND -L

4.1 Configuration, Composition, and Method of Handling

The irradiated U-Al fuel elements processed in this campaign were
of the multiplate box type, with curved fuel plates, that is used in
the Oak Ridge Research Reactor (ORR) and the Low Intensity Test Reactor
(LITR). When received, the elements had overall lengths of 26 to 27
in. (the end boxes had been removed), and the overall cross section of
each was essentially 3.0 by 3.1 in. There were nineteen 2.8-in.-wide
fuel-bearing plates brazed or swaged between two slotted (inert) side
plates. The cladding and structural material was aluminum, and the
"active" core alloy was approximately 18% uranium--82% aluminum. The
17 "inside" fuel plates were 24.625 in. long (active length, 23.625 in.)
and 0.050 in. thick overall (core alloy, 0.020 in.; cladding, 0.015 in.
 

 

12

each side). The two fuel plates comprising two sides of the box had
the same alloy core as the "inside" plates, but were 2.520 in. longer
(overall), and the aluminum cladding was 1-1/2 times as thick (for an
overall thickness of 0.065 in.).

Prior to processing, the elements were stored in a canal under
approximately 10-1/2 ft of water. To transfer the elements to the pro-
cessing plant, a shielded (9 in. of lead) charger-carrier was lowered
to the bottom of the canal. A 0.060-in.-diam zirconium wire, which
had been threaded between the plates of the elements and through an
opening in the closed end of the carrier, was used to slide the ele-
ments, horizontally, from a loading table into the cavity of the charger-
carrier. The carrier was closed, hoisted from the canal, and, after
appropriate procedures to prevent the spread of contamination, brought
into the processing plant. It was placed on the enclosure that shielded
the top of the charging chute (centered above the dissolver), with its
axis vertical and the closed end up. The carrier drawer and the charg-
ing chute valves were opened, and the elements were lowered directly
into the 5-in.-diam section of the dissolver by means of the zirconium
wire that was used to load the elements into the carrier. The wire was
cut while still under load (the elements were allowed to drop a few
inches); the severed wire withdrew into the charging chute sufficiently

The elements processed in runs RA-2, -3, and -4 had been used in
ORR cores, while the RA-1l charge was part of an LITR fueling. In the
ORR, elements are usually irradiated for periods of 10 to 14 days;
then they are removed from the reactor and allowed to cool for 12 to
180 days before being reinserted for the next cycle. Burnups of 2 to
10% per cycle are accumulated over four or five cycles until a total
burnup of about 28 to 32% is achieved. (Here, burnup is defined as the
number of atoms of 235U that have fissioned, divided by the number of
atoms of 235y initially present; thus burnup does not include the 235y

depletion suffered in the formation of 236y py neutron capture.)

The irradiation cycles for the fuel elements that were processed
in the VPP during the aluminum campaign are shown in Table L.1l., For
fuel elements Tu4C, 47C, 60D, 58D, and 93D, each line represents an
irradiation cycle for a specified time (shown in hours) in the reactor
at the indicated average neutron flux for the element's particular
location. Both the burnup achieved during each cycle and the cooling
(or decay) period observed prior to the subsequent cycle are given.
The decay time listed for the last cycle for each element is the time
from reactor shutdown to the beginning of the dissolution step in the
VPP. This value is used throughout this report to designate the cool-

ing time for the element(s) in each rum.

In the LITR, elements are placed in the core, where they remain
until the desired burnup is achieved. New elements are initially placed
on the periphery of the core and later, during the appropriate shutdown,
are transferred to the center section. The irradiation times listed in
Table 4.1 for the fuel elements processed in run RA-1 are the total
times the elements were in the reactor. These times are much longer

than those for ORR fuels because of the much lower flux in the LITR.
4.3 Significant Fission Products

The quantities of the principal fission products that were present
in the irradiated fuel elements at the time of their dissolution are
shown in Table 4.2. These fission products are divided into two
slightly overlepping categories: nuclides contributing a significant
part of the total radioactivity, and nuclides that, due to volatility
at various. times during processing, must receive special consideration
regardless of the amount present. The quantities given in the table
were calculated, using the CRUNCH code, and take into account the alter-

given in Table A-l in Appendix A.)

The most important determinant of the radioactivity contributed

by a particular nuclide at a specific cooling time is its half-life

(t, Ja): The radiation intensity [determined by its decay constant

(A) = 2523 sec] of a long-lived nuclide is relatively low. On the
other hand, a short-lived nuclide may almost completely disappear (i.e.,
it decreases by a factor of n103 after ten half-lives) in a relatively
short time; however, as long as any significant fraction remains, the
radiation intensity may be quite high due to the higher A. For these
reasons, the quantities of long-lived nuclides shown in Table 4.2 de-
crease only slightly as decay times increase. Examples are gp,

106Ry, end 137¢s, which comprise a large fraction of the activity in

the long-cooled run, (RA-1), but are relatively insignificant in the
short-cooled runs (RA-3 and RA-l). Nuclides with intermediate half-
lives (t) 0 = 30 to 90 days), such as 32-day l4lce, do not appear until
shorter cooling times. Insignificant in run RA-1, 14lce increases from
minor significance in RA-2 to become the highest listed intensity in

run RA-k. Four important short-lived (ty 5 = <6 days) nuclides —

390, 1275p, 132Te, and !33%e — are not encountered until run RA-k;

four others —- 1317, 140pgq,, 43py, and 1%7N@ — with slightly longer half-
lives (ty
the decay time is the variable that determines which nuclides will have

<1h dsys), are hardly notable until run RA-L. Obviously,

decayed to insignificance and which remain.

The cyclic irradiation has en effect on the fission product spec-
trum at the time the fuel is discharged, but it is not nearly as impor-
tant &s the cooling time prior to processing. Since the cooling time
between irradiation cycles is generally less than 135 days, the concen-
trations of long-lived (t)/0 >290 days) nuclides increase steadily.

The nuclides with intermediate lives (30 days < 1/0 <90 days) alter-
nately grow in and decay to give, when plotted, a "sawtooth" curve
having gradually increasing maxima. The short-lived (t)/5 <1 days)

nuclides decrease to near 50% or below on each cooling cycle.

5. DISSOLUTION OF FUEL ELEMENTS, AND VOLATILIZATION OF
UFg FROM THE MELT BY FLUORINATION

5.1 Dissolution of Spent Assemblies in Molten K-Zr-Al
Fluoride Salts

During the dissolution (hydrofluorination) of U-Al fuel elements,
HF is vaporized in a steam jacketed vessel, superheated to 100°C in an
electrically heated coil, and fed to the dissolver (hydrofluorinator)
through a line maintained at an average temperature of approximately
500°C (by autoresistance heating). The HF, which enters the dissolver
beneath a distributor plate, is assumed to be at the temperature of the
salt by the time it contacts the element, Although the HF feed rates
may sppear low (20 to 130 g/min), they represent fairly high volumetric
rates at 400 to 600°C. For example, each gram of HF, fully dissociated,
represents about 0.1 ft3 at 410°C and 0.127 £t3 at 600°C (average salt

temperature).

The conditions and results (including data for the fuel charge,
salt compositions, dissolver temperatures, dissolution rates and times
required to attain 90% and 100% completion, and HF feed rates, consump-
tion, and utilization) for the ten aluminum dissolutions in the VPP
are shown in Table 5.1. The runs were made in the chronological order
shown. The runs in the RA (Radioactive, Aluminum) series are listed in
order of decreasing cooling time for the fuel elements processed: RA-1,
approximately 540 days; RA-2, approximately 180 days; RA-3, approximately
80 days; and RA-4, 25 days. A cleanout run, DA-3, is discussed only be-
cause it involved a dissolution of aluminum compareble to others in the

series.

The elements dissolved in the DA (Dummy, Aluminum) and UA (Uranium-
Aluminum) runs were 17-plate aluminum dummies cut to the appropriate
length to give the desired weight. In the UA runs, the uranium was
added as finely powdered UF, packaged in aluminum foil that was less than
1 mil thick. A double charge of UF, was added in run UA-1 so that a mea-
surable amount of UFg product (>100 g) could be withdrawn from the system

after a uranium inventory near the normal steady-state value was established.

In the RA runs, the charges were LITR (RA-1) and ORR elements (RA-2
through RA-4) that had been irradiated to burnups of 22 to 32%.

The barren salts for all the runs except three (DA-2, UA-1, and
DA-3) were binary mixtures consisting of approximately 64 mole % KF
and 36 mole % ZrF,. They were prepared from commercial-grade K;ZrFg
and ZrFy. The "initial" salts (Table 5.1) in four of the runs con-
tained 0.4 to 3.3 mole % AlF3; supplied by heels left in the hydro-

 

fluorinator from the previous runs. In runs DA~2 and UA-1, the high
initial AlF3 was obtained by adding a ternary salt to the hydrofluori-
nator as a solid; in run DA-3, the target composition was a ternary
eutectic with a melting point sufficiently low to permit the ternary
salt to be transferred as a liquid. All the "final" melts contained 54
to 58 mole % KF and either 29 to 32.5 mole % ZrFy--10 to 16 mole %
AlF3 or 18 to 21 mole % ZrFy--23 to 27 mole % AlF;, depending on the

initial AlF3 content; each was readily transferable.

Temperature was not investigated as a process variable; the tem-
peratures used were simply those which we believed would approach the

minima needed to give acceptable operational performance.

The range of the HF dissolvent flow rate was also chosen from the
standpoint of operational experience. Systematic changes in this
variable were not made, and no attempt at optimization with respect
to any particular parameter was made. It was not necessary to keep the
HF flow rate low, since the HF that was not utilized in a particular
pass was recycled; the only additional costs related to high flow rates
were those connected with pumping and heating (or cooling). At very
high gas flow rates, salt entrainment could be troublesome. In the
equipment at Bldg. 3019, the practical upper limit of the HF flow rate
(v130 g/min) is determined by the refrigeration capacity at low HF uti-
lization. At high utilization, pressurization of the off-gas system
can impose an upper limit on HF feed rate. Heat evolution during dis-
solution was never & problem during the aluminum campaign. A lower
limit would probably be imposed by the control system, but this was
not explored; the equipment functioned very satisfactorily at the lowest

HF rate used, 20 g/min.
 

 

 

20

The 9- to 23-hr periods required for 90% dissolution, and the 13-
to 28-hr periods required for 100% dissolution, are based on the actual
volumes of HF consumed, which were recorded as a function of time dur-
ing each run. These volumes ranged from 100 to 116% of the theoretical

HF consumptions.

The tabulated HF utilization values range from 8 to 50% and corre-
late rather well with the HF flow rates; that is, the higher the flow
rate, the lower the utilization. This means that the rate of HF sparging
was too rapid to be effective. However, if this added throughput in-
creased the reaction rate even slightly, by such means as increased tur-
bulence, better film coefficients, gas phase reaction, or improved

temperature distribution, it might be justified.

Correlation of aluminum dissolution rates with run parameters is
difficult since three aluminum-uranium systems, two salt compositions
(as well as intermediate ones), and two schemes of feeding HF were used.
The aluminum dissolution rate and the HF feed rate are plotted vs run
time for each of the ten dissolutions in Appendix A. Figures A-1 through
A-10 show that the average rates and times for dissolution are not en-
tirely representative of what is taking place. Some runs show high rates
initially, while others start low and gradually increase for several |
hours. Some decrease rapidly, whereas others tend to become constant
at different levels. All are characterized by a "tailing out" as total
dissolution is approached, although the length of this tailing varies
widely.

As mentioned earlier, aluminum dissolution rates and the completion
of dissolution are inferred from periodic readings of the inventory of
liquid HF in the recirculating system. These readings are subject to
the usual instrument and reading errors; this may explain some of the
roughness of the plots, which were smoothed to some extent by averaging.
The initial dissolution rate is probably the least reliable of all
since changes in inventories in pipes, vapor spaces, the salt itself,
etc. are also involved. The point at which dissolution is complete is
very difficult to detect. The 90% level of dissolution is considered
to be the point at which 90% of the HF required to achieve 100%

21

dissolution (the point after which no further decrease in HF inventory
occurs) has been consumed. This time is then used to calculate the

90% dissolution rate.

Although the data for 100% dissolution are admittedly not precise,
and the dissolution rate curves are somewhat erratic, the dissolution

times and average rates based on 90% dissolution are fairly accurate

and meaningful and can be used to draw some valid conclusions regarding

the principal variables. By comparing runs DA-1 and DA-2, which were
similar except for the aluminum contents of the initial salt charges,

we must conclude that the salt with the higher aluminum content exhibits
dissolution rates two to three times that of salt containing no alumi~
num initially. The short dissolution time in run DA-3 (i.e., 9.7 hr to
90% completion) confirms this. (Note that the dissolution rate in DA-3
is only one-half that of DA-2; however, the times are consistent since
the weight of fuel used in run DA-2 was twice that in DA-3 and hence
twice the area was available for dissolution.) The salt dissolved in
run UA-1 was similar to that dissolved in DA-2, except that it contained
a relatively large amount of UFy. We believe that the longer dissolu-
tion time that was required to achieve 90% completion in run UA-1 (see

Tgble 5.1) is a statistical variation since the RA- runs give no indi-

cation that the presence of uranium inhibits dissolution. Run UA-2 was

similar to DA-1 except that small amounts of aluminum and uranium were
included in the initial salt; the same slow dissolution was observed.
From a comparison of runs UA~3 and RA-1, we conclude that irradiation
has no discernible effect on dissolution rate; dissolution times for
equal-sized salt charges were equal, although the weight of metal in
the charges differed by a factor of 2. Further justification for

this conclusion was provided by the results obtained in run RA-2, which
was a duplicate of run RA-1 except that the salt for RA-2 initially
contained 3 mole % AlFj. oo

Dissolution rates were considerably higher (from the standpoint
of total time required or in terms of rate per unit area of aluminum)

in runs RA-3 and -U4 than in runs RA-1 and -2. Three variables, which
 

 

 

22

could cause different dissolution rates, were: the ZrF, content, the
temperature, and the HF flow rate. The effects of these parameters

on dissolution rate have not been studied. Based on results in other
runs and on previous operating experience, we would not expect the

first two to cause significant changes in dissolution rate. In all the
runs prior to RA-3, the HF flow rate was increased up to the maximum
(125 to 130 g/min) as soon as possible. As cooling times became shorter,
however, we decided to react the bulk of the elements at lower flow
rates and not risk the production of "bursts" of off-gas, which, in

turn, would cause pressurization of the off-gas system. It is possible

‘that local cooling effects of the excess gas or hydraulic effects

(especially while the multichannel configuration is still intact) could
affect dissolution rate.

5.2 Conversion of the Dissolved UFy to UFg, and Transfer of the
Volatilized UFg from the Melt to
NaF Absorber Beds Using Elemental Fluorine

During the fluorination step, elemental fluorine is admitted at
the bottom of the fluorinator through a draft tube. The purpose of
this tube is to increase circulation within the melt. In the fluorina-
tor, the fluorine contacts the molten selt and reacts with the dissolved
UF,. Both the UFg that is formed and the excess fluorine pass up through
the vapor space into the movable-bed (NaF pellets) absorber. The lower,

or nearly horizontal,* section of this absorber, which is maintained

¥The movable-bed absorber was originally constructed with a horizon-
tal section and a vertical section. During initial testing, it became
apparent that tilting the unit down (with respect to the entry point)
would result in a longer effective length of horizontal section due to
the angle of repose of the pellets (v45°). Absorption in the horizontal
section, rather than in the vertical section, is desirable since the
horizontal piston can easily move any sintered pellets in this section.
Hence, the unit was tilted 15° in the VPP, resulting in the displace-
ment of the horizontal and the vertical sections 15° from the horizontal
and the vertical axes, respectively.

at 400°C, removes most of the fission product fluorides that are vola-
tilized from the melt; the UFg passes to the upper, or vertical, section
(maintained at 150°C), where it is sorbed quantitatively. At 150°C the
MoFg passes through to a 20 to 30°C NaF trap, which is used to remove any
UFg that could have passed through the 150°C trap. The off-gas is
scrubbed with an aqueous caustic solution (thus removing the fluorine)
and then combined with the cell off-gas; the resulting off-gas stream

is scrubbed with caustic and, finally, is filtered and vented to the

stack.

The conditions and results for seven fluorination-sorption and de-
sorption runs and two simulations are presented in Table 5.2. In each
run, the melt-gas interface was within the lower 15-1/4-in.-ID cylin-
drical section of the fluorinator. The temperature of the salt was
measured by a thermocouple in a well situated beneath the surface of
the melt. This temperature was held only as high as was considered

necessary to maintain the salt as a liquid; the purpose of such tempera-

ture control, of course, was to minimize corrosion. The density of the

salt was measured by a differential-pressure cell that was placed across

two bubbler probes stationed 5 in. apart.

The uranium concentration in the fluorination salt was obtained

by analyzing a sample of the salt in the fluorinator. Salt samples

were taken from beneath the surface of the melt by using a copper ladle

suspended on & Monel chain. Each sample that was withdrawn was actually
a composite of the dissolution product from the current run (including
the heel left in the hydrofluorinator from the previous run) and the
heel left in the fluorinator from the previous run. The latter heel

contained very little uranium; thus it acted only as a diluent.

Fluorination rates for the hot runs were 6 and ll std liters/min.
The lower rate was used in the first parts of the runs in an effort to
produce more uniform loading of the NaF pellet bed during the period
when UFg evolution was most repid. The higher rate, which served to
improve the circulation of the salt through the draft tube, was used

later in the runs in an attempt to minimize the amount of uranium lost
 

Table 5.2.

Conditions and Results for Fluorination-Sorption and Desorption Runs in the VPP

First two runs were practice runs with no uranium; solid UF, was added to the salt in the next three runs;

in the last four runs, irradiated fuel elements were processed.

in the waste salt. Fluorine utilization was calculated by assuming
that one mole of fluorine reacted per mole of UF, present in the salt.
The absorber temperatures shown in Table 5.2 are averages over the

fluorination period.

The most important values in Table 5.2 are the uranium concentra-
tions in the vaste salt (shown in the last column). The first value
listed for runs UA-2 through RA-1 and for RA-4 is the uranium content
of the melt after fluorination; the second value is the concentration
after the UFg had been desorbed from the NaF-filled movable-bed absorber
and a batch of NaF pellets had been discharged from the horizontal sec-
tion, which is maintained at 400°C, into the fluorinator. In runs RA-2
and -3, two fluorinations were made without an intervening desorption
or pellet discharge. All salt samples (except in run UA-1) were taken

from the fluorinator in the manner described earlier.

As in the zirconium campaign,” the uranium concentration in the

melt after fluorination seemed to vary in a random fashion when it was

~only a few parts per million. Any correlation of this concentration

with fluorination time, temperature, initial concentration, irradia-
tion, batch size, or melt depth was not obvious in the range of the

variables investigated.

The amount of uranium returned to the fluorinator in the NaF pellets
from the 400°C absorber bed should be a function of sorption and desorp-
tion conditions, but not of fluorination conditions. The higher losses
in runs RA-2 and -3 were probably the result of loading the bed via two
fluorination-sorption cycles prior to desorption. Possibly, longer
times at the meximum desorption temperature (400°C) would have reduced
the amount of uranium that was returned. In instances where the amount
of uranium returned might be greater than that which could be economically
discharged, the melt could be fluorinated repeatedly until the uranium

concentration reached the desired terminal level.

5.3 Distribution of Significant Fission Products During

Dissolution, Fluorination, and Desorption

During the dissolution step, unreacted HF was condensed into a
catch tank and then revaporized and returned to the recycle system.
Any particulate matter was collected in this catch tank. Hydrogen (a
reaction product) and noncondensables passed through to a tank contain-
ing caustic (2 M KOH), called the caustic neutralizer (KN), where the
gaseous mixture was bubbled through approximately 3 ft of liquid. At
the end of each run, the HF heel in the catch tank was discharged to
the KN; thus, all of the fission product materiel that was collected
from the hydrofluorination off-gas was represented by samples from the
KN. In a somewhat similar manner, the unreacted fluorine from the
fluorinator, after passing through an NaF absorber and a urenium
clean-up trap, entered a scrubbing tower where it was reacted with cir-
culating 2 M KOH. A sample of the scrub solution was representative
of the radioactive material that was evolved during fluorination or

desorption and removed in the scrubber.

The amount of radioactive material that was released to the stack
was calculated from the analyses of a charcoal trap through which a sam-
ple of gas from the bottom of the stack had been drawn. The radio-
active noble gases were assumed to be released upon dissolution (measure-
ments of the radioactivity level of the off-gas being discharged through
the stack were made, but the relatively small amount of radioactive
material that was released during dissolution precluded quantitative
results using this method ). The molten salt was not sampled until it
had been transferred to the fluorinator after hydrofluorination. Here
it was sampled both before and after fluorination, end after the NaF
pellets had been discharged from the absorber bed. Agreement between
samples taken before and after fluorination was not good. In general,
the values obtained for most fission products were higher (as predicted
by laboratory investigation) after fluorination; this was unexpected,
based on representative samples of a homogeneous melt. In one run,

radiochemical analyses were made of samples withdrawn before and after

the NaF pellet discharge, but the sensitivity of the results was not
high enough to permit an estimation of the activity returned to the
melt by the pellet discharge. In all cases, the "salt" activity
values presented later will be the higher of the pre- and postfluorina-

tion samples.

The amounts of significant fission products found in the salt,
HF, fluorine, off-gas scrubber solutions, the UFg product, and the
stack effluent are tabulated later in this section for each hot run.
As mentioned in Sect. 4.3, a particular fission product may be impor-
tant because it is troublesome (volatile, etc.) or because it contri-
butes significantly to the general radiation background. In the earlier
runs, the long-lived fission products were the most important; however,
as cooling times decreased, the nuclides with intermediate and short
half-lives received more attention. In run RA-lU, emphasis was on nu-
clides with half-lives on the order of eight days or less; these
nuclides had not been present previously in appreciable quantities in
molten salt processing. In comparing quantities of the various nuclides
expected at the time of processing (machine calculation by the CRUNCH
code) with the totals actually found by radiochemical analyses, we con-
cluded that agreement of these values within a factor of 2 is satis-
factory and that agreement within an order of magnitude is not to be

considered grossly in error.

In run RA-1 (two LITR elements cooled 19 months, Table 5.3), the
long-lived nuclides %%sr, 106gu, 137¢s, and ““Ce provided the major
percentage of the radioactivity; in addition, some 93Zr-%5Np (t1/5 =
65 days) end 1271 (tp
period of 570 days. Only a low yield of 2355p (0.023%) was obtained,
but this nuclide has a long half-life (2.7 years) and is expected to

= 90 days) were still present after a cooling

be volatile (as in the zirconium cempaign)® during hydrofluorination.
Results confirmed that the antimony and the tellurium were volatile,

while the other nuclides remained in the salt.

In run RA-2 (two ORR elements cooled 175 days, Table 5.4), three

additional nuclides - 89gr, 103gy, and 129Te - are present; however,

An addition to the quantities listed, the following quantities of fission products were found on the nickel wool trap (FV-154)
between the F, system caustic scrubber and the off-gas scrubber: 44 uci of 129m, 164 uCi of 106Ry, and 17 pCi of 103Ry,

they do not represent any new chemical species. In instances where we
are interested in two isotopes of the seme element (e.g., strontium
end ruthenium), we did not feel that it was necessary to obtain a com-
plete set of analyses for both nuclides since it was assumed that their
chemical behavior is similar. The material balances for the nonvola-
tile elements in this run are considerably better than in run RA-1.
Again, antimony and tellurium were volatilized during hydrofluorina-
tion, and tellurium and ruthenium were partially removed from the salt
during fluorination. A small quantity of tellurium was carried through

the off-gas scrubber and released to the stack.

In run RA-3 (two ORR elements cooled 80 days, Table 5.5), three
new species (21y, 1311, and !%0Ba) and one additional isotope (1*1ce)
were present; of these, only the 131 proved to be of any concern.
The iodine balance in this run was excellent; greater than 90% remained
in the salt, while about 9% was found in the caustic used in the HF
system. Traces were also found in the other two scrubbers and on the
stack sampler. As previously, the tellurium was volatilized in both
major processing steps, and about 5% of the total found was released
to the stack; a small amount of ruthenium was also released. Most of
the antimony and some ruthenium and niobium were found in the ceustic
used in the HF system. The material balances for all nuclides except
103gy, 106Ry, ana 12721297 ranged from 67 to 152%, which is considered

to be excellent.

In run RA-4 (one ORR element, cooled 25 days), the presence of
greater than 2-1/4 kilocuries of 133%e made the total activity from
the noble gases 100 times that of the 85kr; however, high dilution
factors and high MPC values made rapid release safe. In RA-kL, the
total release required more than 10 hr; if it had been accomplished
over a 3-hr period, the ground-level concentration would still have
been less than 1% of the MPC.

The significent fission products for run RA-l4 are shown in Table
5.6. Three short-lived nuclides, absent in runs RA-1, -2, and -3, were

present in this run: 9%Mo, !llAg, and 132Te. The 132Te represented

e 60% increase of the 12751297¢ total, and the 127qy, activity was a
factor of 5 times the customary activity of 125Sb. The presence of
33Mo presented a serious problem since special procedures had been
necessary to prevent stable molybdenum from following the UFg product.
In general, the results obtained in RA-4 confirmed the trends observed
in the earlier runs; however, the data of RA-L should be considered to
be more significant because of the appreciably higher activity levels.
(Note that in Table 5.6 some of the units are larger than in preceding
tables.) As previously, tellurium and ruthenium were volatilized
principally during fluorination; antimony and iodine, along with frac-
tional percentages of niobium and cesium, were evolved during the
hydrofluorination step. Some antimony also appeared in the UFg product
and in the caustic used in the fluorination system. Although greater
than 90% of the 99%o was found in the salt, the remainder was well dis-
tributed. Analyses showed that greater than 3% of the 99%Mo was present
in each of the two system scrubbers, 0.16% was present in the off-gas
scrubber, and 2.3% was found in the UFg product. None was detected

in the stack sampler. About 20 curies of tellurium and traces of 131I
and ruthenium were released through the stack, but the ground-level
concentration was calculated to be much less than 5% of MPC, assuming

a UO0-min release time and a stack-to-ground dilution factor of 103

(see Sect. T).

With only one exception, no unusual or unexpected events occurred
as a result of processing at the higher activity level of run RA-4
(about 1-1/2 times that in RA-3, even though twice as many fuel elements
were processed in RA~3). Upon sparging the salt prior to withdrawing
the first samples from the fluorinator, there was a rapid increase in
the background radiation in the vicinity of the chemical trap (FV-121).
The increase continued until sparging was stopped; the radiation inten-
sity then decreased in a typical manner (i.e., an exponential decay
curve). The rate of decrease indicated that 1321 (t1/5 = 2.4 hr), the
daughter of 1320, was the source of the activity. The salt had been
gllowed to remain static (i.e., only low-rate nitrogen purges were

allowed to flow) in the hydrofluorinator for several hours while
 

 

 

3h

temperatures were adjusted preparatory to transferring the salt to the
fluorinator. Evidently, during this period, a sizable amount of 1327
grew in from the decay of 132m, and largely remained in the salt until
fluorination. Sparging in the fluorinator caused the 1321 to be carried
through the 150°C NaF absorber and heated piping to the ambient-tempera-
ture trap (FV-121), where it deposited on the relatively cold surface.

The decay product was stable xenon, which could not be traced.

Table 5.7 presents a comparison of the important data (from the
standpoint of radiation background) from Tables 5.3-5.6, expressed on

a percentage basis.
6. QUALITY OF UFg PRODUCT, AND URANIUM INVENTORY

The uranium hexafluoride product was collected by desublimation
as it was desorbed from the NaF pellets in the movable-bed absorber
(FV-105). As the bed was heated from 150 to 400°C, the UFg-2NaF
complex decomposed. The UFg was carried, via fluorine, through a porous
metal filter into the product cylinder, which was cooled with a dry
ice--trichloroethylene mixture. After the product had been collected,
HF was removed from the cylinder by flashing (7 min at 0°C under vacuum);
the cylinder was then weighed and sampled. Teble 6.1 gives the weights,
the uranium contents, and the isotopic analyses of the products col-
lected in the four hot runs. Results for an additional run (UA-3) are
included to show an "unburned" isotopic composition. Obviously, all
the uranium added to the system in a particular run does not appear in
the product for that run since, in this seven-run campaign, about one-
third of the uranium was held up in cold traps, NaF traps, salt heels,
ete. This holdup led to a blending, or an overlap, of products from
run to run. The analysis of the uranium product, as reported, is the
result of a coulometric determination in which all the uranium was
assumed to be 238y, the values in the table have been corrected for
the appropriate isotopic analysis. All of the values are in reasonable
agreement with the theoretical uranium content of UFg (67.36%) for the

assays involved.

6.1 Fission Product Decontamination Factors
for the UFg Product

Most of the fission products remained in the melt and were dis-
carded with the waste salt. Portions of the fission products that were
volatilized during fluorination were sorbed on the NaF pellets in the
movable-bed absorber (FV-105). The small fractions of these radio-
nuclides that were desorbed along with the UFg usually constituted the
contaminants in the product cylinder. (However, it is possible that
some of these contaminants were deposited in earlier runs and were
acquired from the connecting piping.) The decontamination factors
(DF's) for various fission products in the four hot runs are shown ‘in

Table 6.2.

The first of the four columns for each run lists the activity for
each nuclide in the fuel, as calculated by the CRUNCH code. (Techne-
tium-99 is omitted from the table and is discussed in Sect. 6.3.)

This value, which is given on a per-milligram-of-uranium basis, was
obtained by dividing by the number of milligrams of uranium remaining
in the fuel as determined by the reactor operations burnup calculations.

(This is also the uranium content of the fuel for accountability pur-

poses.)

The second and third columns show the results of the analysis of
the UFg product for radioactive contaminants. Multiple samples of the UFg
product (as a liquid) were analyzed; the second column gives the acti-
vity level (on the date of analysis) that was thought to be most repre-
sentative for each nuclide. Sampling was done by heating and tipping
the product cylinder; hence the tabulated values do not reflect the
degree of purification that would have been afforded by vapor sampling
of the UFg. In the third column, the activity is placed on a per-

milligram-of-uranium basis.

The DF's in the first three runs were quite satisfactory, generally
ranging from 107 to 101%, The 125gsb DF, which decreased to 1.4 x 106
in run RA-3, is an obvious exception. The 196Ru DF was low (10% to 107)

in the first two runs, but its improvement in RA-3 (to 1.8 x 108) and

the fact that 103Ry was not detected lead to the conclusion that 106Ru
may have been acquired from incompletely decontaminated (from the pre-
vious campaign) process piping. Tellurium and iodine decontamination,
although not high, was satisfactory; the principal concern with these
radionuclides is release to the atmosphere, which is discussed in Sect.
T. The DF for cerium, representing the rare earths, was consistently
high.

In run RA-L, the decontamination factors were somewhat lower than
in the first three runs, generally ranging from 2 x 10° to 108. The
low antimony DF mey have been caused by the transfer of a large amount
of antimony into the fluorinator as a result of the shorter hydrofluo-
rination period employed in RA-4. The low 99Mo DF was not surprising
since the chemical properties of MoFg are quite similar to those of UFg.
The "molybdenum stripping" feature of the process was intended to keep
the bulk of the stable molybdenum from contaminating the UFg product,
but was not expected to effect the complete removal required for radio-
chemical decontamination. The 2%Mo (t)/0 = 2.8 days) would not be pre-
sent in fuel processed after a cooling period of 60 days; it would decay
out of the product (to <0.1%) 30 days after processing. Such a cooling
period might be desirable to allow for decay of the unavoidable 237y,
The 11g is believed to be of no concern since none of the scrubber
solutions showed any appreciable concentrations of it; a low yield and

a high limit of detection combined to give an indeterminate DF for this

nuclide.

Generally speaking, the DF's obtained in the first three runs were
gbout one order of magnitude lower than those achieved in the earlier
zirconium program.’ We believe that this is due, at least in part, to
fluorinating at 550°C rather than at 500°C. The lower DF's in run RA-k4
may be due to one or more of the following factors. First, if the
sintered-metal filter located just upstream of the product cylinder had
failed, NaF fines could have carried fission products into the UFg
cylinder. Second, in run RA-4, the additional HF sparge carried out

after dissolution was complete was shortened; therefore, the molten

 

 
 

 

 

ko

salt may have carried a higher percentage of the fission products into
the fluorinator. Finally (end this factor seems most significant), the
quantity of NaF pellets discharged from the movable-bed absorber may
have been insufficient. In the aluminum program, 3.8 kg of NaF (about
11% of the bed) was discharged during each run, as compared with about
6.5 kg in the zirconium program. Insufficient bed discharge would
result in an upward migration and eventual breakthrough of some fission

products.

6.2 Primary Radioactive Contaminants in the
Product from Run RA-k4

The gamma scan for the product samples in run RA-4 (the short-
cooled run) indicated that the radioactivity of the product was almost
entirely due to the presence of 2%Mo and 237U. The 237y content of the
product was equivalent to a radioactivity level of 2.53 x 10!! disin-
tegrations per minute per gram of UFg at a cooling time of approximately

39 days.

The gross beta activity of the product in run RA-4 was 2.7 x 101!
disintegrations per minute per gram of UFg, assuming a 10% geometry
during analysis. This value is 102 to 103 times the gross beta activity
of the product in run RA-3 (3.66 x 108 disintegrations per minute per

gram of UFg).

Radiation readings for the product cylinders in runs RA-3 and RA-L,
taken with a cutie pie at various times after the run was completed,

were as follows:

Approximate Cutie Pie

Cooling Time Reading
Run No. (days) (r/nhr)
RA-3 ~85 0.5
RA-4 28 (completion of run) 50
RA-k4 36 6.2
RA-L 39 4.2

RA-h4 Lo 2
 

 

Li

The decrease in the readings of the RA-4 product reflects the decay
of both 2%Mo ana 237v.

6.3 Removal of Technetium, Neptunium, and Plutonium
from the UFg Product

The removal of technetium, neptunium, and plutonium from the UFg
product is discussed separately in this section because of the incom-
pleteness of the data. This, in turn, is due to the difficulty of
obtaining valid analyses of highly radioactive material. Most of the
data for these three elements were discarded as meaningless; for example,
one set of analyses indicated that the 237yp content of the fuel was

20 times as great as the total uranium content.

The recovery of plutonium in the processing of highly enriched
uranium fuels is not economically feasible. Hence the only concern,
with respect to plutonium, in the runs discussed in this report is
assurance that the plutonium content of the UFg product is within rea-
sonable limits. Past experience in molten-salt volatility processing
has shown excellent plutonium decontamination; the data from the alumi-

num program are given later in this section.

In general, technetium and neptunium fluorides tend to follow UFg
through the sorption-desorption cycle in the NaF bed, although the data
below suggest that the cycle might be arranged to achieve some decon-
tamination. Thus a separate purification step, in which TcFg and NpFs

were sorbed on MgF, pellets, was employed.

Some technetium apparently remained in the off-gas stream during
sorption; for example, analysis of the NaF in the chemical trap down-
stream from the sorber showed 3.6 ppm of technetium at the entrance and
0.5 ppm at about the middle of the trap at the conclusion of runs RA-1,
-2, and -3. However, most of the technetium was found on the MgF,.
Inlet and outlet samples of the sorbent from the MgF, bed showed the
following 99Tc concentrations: RA-1, -2, and -3 (combined), 1540 ppm
and not greater than 0.15 ppm respectively; RA-L4, 8.8 ppm and 1.7 ppm;
 

 

 

Lo

and T-18,%¥ 970 ppm and 2 ppm. Results of the analyses of samples of
the composite bed for the entire series indicated that a total of 390
mg of %9T¢ was present in the 973-g bed. The products in the first
three runs contained very little 9°Tc: 4.6, 2.4, and 1.1 parts of
technetium per million parts of uranium respectively. However, in
run RA-4, the product analyzed 440 ppm. This discrepancy has not, as

yet, been explained.

The results for neptunium were similar to those for technetium.

Some neptunium reached the chemical trap during runs RA-1, -2, and -3;
the 237yp concentrations in the NaF at the inlet and at the middle of
the trap were 23 ppm and 1 ppm respectively. Analyses of samples of
MgF, (inlet and outlet respectively) showed: RA-1, -2, and -3, 2310
ppm and 40 ppm; RA-4, 490 ppm end 150 ppm; and T-18,% 1140 ppm and 420
ppm. Analyses of samples of the composite bed indicate that 785 mg of
237Np was present in the bed. Analyses of the UFg products for runs
RA-1 through -4 showed no consistent trend: 140, less than 12, 1670,
and 1860 parts of 237Np per million parts of uranium.

Plutonium data are available from runs RA-3 and RA-L. Data from
run RA-3 confirm the difficulty of fluorinating plutonium from a molten
salt. For the first fluorination in run RA-3, the feed salt and the
waste salt showed essentially the same plutonium concentration (1.19
x 10% ana 1.25 x 10% counts per minute per gram of salt, respectively);
the feed salt concentration was equivalent to 1.2 x 10° counts per minute
per gram of wranium, For the second fluorination, the plutonium radio-
activity in the feed salt was 1.26 x 106 counts per minute per gram of
salt (equivalent to 1.6 x 10° counts per minute per gram of urenium),
but the analysis of the waste salt showed only 5.1 x 105 counts per
minutes per grem of salt. Radiochemical analyses of four product (UFg)
samples from run RA-UI for plutonium yielded the following results:

3.1 x 10%, 5.1 x 103, 1.7 x 10%, and 4.5 x 10% counts per minute per
gram of UFg. If we discard the second value, the average is 3.1 x 10%

®
T-18 was a cleanup run (using barren salt) made following run RA-k.
 

43

counts per minute per gram of UFg, or 4.6 x 10% counts per minute per
gram of uranium. Based on a 51% counting geometry, 4.6 x 10% is equiva-

lent to a 23%pu concentration of 0.63 ppm.
6.4 Nonradioactive Cationic Contaminants

Contamination of the UFg products (Table 6.3) with nonradioactive
cations was higher than desirable. Analyses of the products from indi-
vidual runs (even when multiple samples from the product of a single
run were used) were too inconsistent for valid interpretation. However,
results of the analysis of the composite product, consisting of a com-
bination of these products in a form suitable for shipment, appear
quite reasonable. The concentrations of most of the cationic contami-
nants, including Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, and Zr, were less than 50 parts per
million parts of uranium, The boron and potassium contents were about T5
ppm and 500 ppm respectively. Three other metals were present in the
following (approximate) quantities: molybdenum, 0.1%; aluminum, 0.3%;
and sodium, 1%. The molybdenum content of the product was dependent on
the conditions under which the movable-bed absorber was operated. The
high sodium content led us to suspect that the sintered-metal filter
located just upstream of the product cylinder had failed, allowing NaF
fines to be released. The high aluminum content has not been completely

explained, but is believed to be nonrepresentative.

6.5 Cumulative Material Balances for Salt and Uranium

A cumulative salt balance was maintained throughout each run in
the aluminum-uranium campaign (Table 6.4). This allowed us to obtain
a uranium balance (uranium concentrations were reported as grams of

uranium per gram of salt), and it also provided a check on the instru-

mentation that was used to measure the level and density of molten salt.
It was imperative that the volume of salt in the fluorinator be known

accurately in order to avoid overfilling the waste salt can. The

volume of waste salt that was transferred was measured by difference

in the fluorinator, since the waste can contained no instrumentation.

(FV-100) are the quantities that were indicated by instruments on the
vessels; the quantities of barren salt and AlFj3 were based on known
weights; and the NaF that was added to FV-100 from the absorber (FV-105)
- was measured by FV-100 instrumentation. The recovery for each run is
the total of the final heels (as measured by vessel instrumentation)
and the waste salt (as measured by "before and after transfer readings"

on FV-100 instruments).

The column labeled "FV-100 after DPT" is included to indicate the
degree of religbility of vessel instrumentation. Theoretically, the
value for each run should be equal to the weight of the initial salt
charge minus the sum of the weights of the NaF from FV-105 and the
final heel in FV-1000. Experience has shown that measurements of changes
in vessel contents are reasonably relisble when they are made using a
single set of instruments. The data in Table 6.4 indicate discrepancies

between instruments.

A very poor material balance was obtained for the freeze valve salt
charging (FVS). Since only a small quantity of material was charged and
since instrument heels and line volumes would account for some salt, a
low material balance was expected. However, the balance for the subse-
quent run compensated for the low balance; thus the weights of the final
heel after FVS and the initial heel for run DA-1 are probably incorrect.

Each of the two runs RA-2 and RA-3 consisted of a complete dissolu-
tion, a partial transfer of salt from FV-1000 to FV-100, fluorination,
transfer of waste salt, transfer of remaining salt from FV-1000 to FV-100,
fluorination, discard of NaF pellets from FV-105, end transfer of waste

salt. Hence, a salt balance is shown for each fluorination.

An overall material balance of 101.1% is within the anticipated
accuracy of the measurements involved. Therefore, the reliability of
the instrumentation was adequate for process control, and experience
in the first few runs generated a high degree of confidence in the

measurements.

The uranium content of the salt was calculated from the salt bal-
ance data presented in Table 6.14 and from analyses of salt samples.
This information was used, along with weights and analyses of effluents
(including the product) and accountability data for the material

charged, to obtain the uranium material balances shown in Table 6.5.
T. RELEASE OF FISSION PRODUCTS TO THE ENVIRONMENT

Various quantities of fission products were released through the
3020 stack to the atmosphere during the fluorination step in the hot
runs (see Table T.1l). Noble gases were released during dissolution, but
they were not detected at ground level. In the least desirable case
(Run RA-b), less than 1 mCi of }96Ru and less than 10 mCi of !3!I were
released. A total of dbout 20 Ci of tellurium was released; of this,
6 Ci was T8-hr 132Te, which decays to 2.3-hr !32I and, in turn, to
stable xenon. Calculations to determine the percentage of the maximum
permissible concentration (MPC) represented by these releases were made
by assuming a constant rate of release during the fluorination period.
The most unfavorable case was 1311 (<0.1% of MPC); however, even if the
entire quantity of 1317 had been released during a period as short as
1 min, the combined fraction of MPC for all three fission products
(1297e, 1311, ang 106Ru) would still have been below 5%. We conclude
that fuel that has been cooled for as long as 25 days can be processed
by the molten-salt fluoride-volatility process with no hazard relative

to the release of fission products.

The quantity of tellurium (20 Ci) that was released during run
RA-4 represented only sbout 5% of the calculated quantity in the fuel
element. The major fraction of the tellurium that was volatilized
(i.e., less than one-half of the tellurium in the fuel) was removed by
the KOH scrubber solution. An attempt was made to remove tellurium in
a trap located downstream from the fluorine scrubber. This trap con-
sisted of nickel mesh heated to 400°C, a gas cooler, and an activated-

charcoal bed meintained near ambient temperature (<50°C). Although

Bpeses for calculation: (1) rate of air flow through the stack was 43,000 cfm; (2) atmospheric dilution of air discharged from the 3020 stack was 105;
(3) fission products were released at a constant rate during the entire fluorination period (40 min). Quantities of fission products were determined

appreciable amounts of tellurium were held by the trap, a significant
fraction was allowed to pass through to the off-gas stack. Some of the
trapped material was subsequently released after evolution from the
fluorinator had ceased; thus, the trap helped extend the release period.
It appears that, although the quantity of tellurium that was dispersed
did not constitute a hazard, further developmental work in this area

would be advisable.

All of the effluent streams in run RA-U4 were analyzed to determine
the fate of iodine. Of the 2293 Ci of 1311 present at the time of dis-
solution, only 110 Ci was accounted for by analyses. Since laboratory
experience has indicated that there is a low probability of finding the
jodine in a fused salt, we believe that the remainder of the iodine was
either "plated out" in the vessels or was discharged in the waste salt.
Of the 110 Ci accounted for, 109 Ci was found in the caustic solution
used for scrubbing the dissolver off-gas and 0.8 Ci was found in the
caustic used for scrubbing the fluorinator off-gas. The quantities of
iodine found in the other streams were insignificant; essentially none
was released to the atmosphere. We conclude that molten—salt fluoride-
volatility processing of nuclear fuels presents no iodine release
hazard, regardless of the length of the cooling period between irradia-

tion and processing.

10.3 Appendix C: Decontamination of
Pilot Plant Equipment

Decontamination methods similar to those described for decontami-
nating the plant after the zirconium program was completed were used
to reduce radiation levels in excess of 5000 r/hr to levels sufficiently
low to permit the plant to be dismantled. Radiation dosage to indivi-
duals who did the mechanical work did not exceed the quarterly 1.3-r
allowance (see data in Table E-1). Final backgrounds (prior to equip-
ment removal) were 1 to 5 r/hr in the majority of cell 1 locations; a
maximum reading of 60 r/hr was obtained adjacent to the HF inlet line
to the dissolver. Backgrounds in other areas of the plant were generally
less than 1 r/hr.

The decontamination sequence included flushing with a molten salt,

followed by treatment with three types of aqueous solutions for removing

‘salt film, metal scale, and deposits of radioactive nuclides. The

compositions of the three solutions were, respectively:
Ammonium oxalate, 0.3 to 0.35 M
Aluminum nitrate, 0.1 M; or A1(NO3)3+HNO3, 0.1 to 0.01 M
Sodium hydroxide~-hydrogen peroxide--sodium tartrate, sbout
5-1-1 wt %.

This procedure is suitable for use with radiation levels at least
as high as those encountered in the operating period cited, and it does
not result in excessive personnel exposure during the decontamination

and subsequent equipment removal.

10.4 Appendix D: Corrosion of Vessels

Corrosion studies in the Volatility programs were directed pri-
marily at the dissolver (hydrofluorinator) and the fluorinator for
three reasons. First, these two vessels were located in a congested
"no-access" area that was accessible only after extensive decontamina-
tion, whereas many of the other vessels were located in limited-access
areas. Second, these vessels, which were a part of the head-end por-
tion of the plant, were essential to the operation of the plant, and
their replacement would require a major shutdown (in addition to the
necessary decontamination). Third, corrosion observed on the other
vessels and components was slight, probably because the conditions
under which they were operated (especially temperature and contact with

corrosive chemicals) were less drastic.

Earlier Studies at BMI. Studies made at BMI (Battelle Memorial
Institute) of the dissolver under run conditions indicated a metal
loss of 0.2 mil/month for INOR-8 during aluminum processing as com-
pared with 2.5 to 5 mils/month during zirconium processing. | No
intergranular attack was observed. Later studies indicated an INOR-8
corrosion rate of approximately 10 mils/month during aluminum processing
because of intergranular attack.S The total time of HF exposure during

the aluminum runs was 250 hr.

Studies at BMI indicated a corrosion rate of approximately 100
mils/month for the "L" nickel fluorinator during aluminum alloy pro-
cessing as compared with approximately 30 mils /month during zirconium
processing. The higher rate was at least partially attributed to the
higher operating temperature [600°C rather than 500°C (ref. 9)] that

was used in the aluminum processing.

Corrosion of the Dissolver. The total corrosion of the dissolver
during the 10 aluminum runs was 5 mils, as previously reported.’ This
value was obtained by using pulse-echo and Vidigage techniques. Previous

corrosion dete for the dissolver are reported elsewhere.

Fluorinator. (a) Vessel. — Corrosion data for the fluorinator
during zirconium processing are reported elsewhere.” (However, the
date for the last 11 zirconium runs were not reported in that reference
because the fluorinator was not examined between the end of the zir-
conium program and the start of the aluminum program.) Corrosion
results obtained on examination of the fluorinator after the plant
was dismantled following the aluminum program are reported in Table
D-1. The values listed in Table D-1 are for 50 runs (ko zirconium

runs and 10 aluminum runs) and all aqueous decontamination sequences.

The region most vulnerable to attack was the salt region, as noted
previously. The maximum corrosion was less than 3/4 mil per run; the
average was less than 1/2 mil per run. Visual examination of the in-
side of the fluorinator revealed no evidence of excessive attack. Com-
parison of the losses in total wall thickness (Table D-1) with data
obtained in the earlier corrosion study” revealed that metal losses of
spproximately 10 mils apparently occurred in the bottom of the vessel

(but not in the top) during the aluminum runs.

(b) Corrosion Rods. — The corrosion rods that were placed in
the fluorinator in late 1962 were removed when the plant was dismantled
following the aluminum program. Results of visual inspection of the
rods are summarized in Teble D-2. The rods were not examined metal-
lographically because of the termination of the Volatility program in
mid-1967T.

Other Vessels and Components. (a) HFV-2207-1 (HF inlet line to
the dissolver). — Visual inspection of the 3-ft length of INOR-8 line,
including the elbow, showed only minor scratches. No evidence of
leakage was noted when this section of pipe was pressurized to 35 psig.
This portion of the line was examined because it had failed during
early volatility processing.” At that time, however, the line was
made of Inconel instead of INOR-8.

(vb) Fluorine Supply Tanks. — Inspection of the inside of

tank NB-1432 on June T, 1962, revealed no corrosion; no leakage occurred

during a T75-psig pneumatic test. The 1/2-in. gage outlet on the rear
head appeared to be cavitating in the heated-affected zone of the weld.
The filled weld around this outlet on She tank exterior was thought to
be adequate to take care of the condition on a temporary basis. All
stop valves in the manifold section were checked and reworked if
necessary. The external surfaces were found to be corroding; painting

of these surfaces was recommended.

Inspection of the inside of tank NB-1k33 on July 28, 1966, revealed
no corrosion; no leakage was observed when the tank was pressurized to
T5 psig. Inlet and outlet stubs that had been welded to the rear head
showed no corrosion. All stop valves in the manifold section were
checked and overhauled. External surfaces of the unit were satisfactory;

the unit was repainted.

(c) Other Vessels. — No visible corrosion was detected visu-
ally in (1) the movable-bed absorber (FV-105), (2) the flash cooler
(FV-1001), (3) the HF condenser (FV-2001), or (4) the fuel element
charging chute on the dissolver (FV-1002).

10.5 Appendix E: Radiation Safety

Penetrating radiation from materials being processed required that
each piece of equipment containing the material be heavily shielded to
prevent exposure of operating personnel. Access to the process equip-
ment was carefully controlled at all times during normal operation and
while maintenance or decontamination operations were in progress. The
physical form of the material involved (dust particles, liquids, or
gases) governed the type of protective clothing and respiratory equip-

ment that was used in these shielded areas.

The average rate and the maximum rate of personnel exposure to
radiation in the aluminum program were about the same as those encountered
in the zirconium program. In each case, exposure rates were highest
during plant decontamination procedures because temporary, unshielded
piping was connected to "dead end" process lines in normal work areas
for recycle of solutions. Even under these conditions, however, the
maximum exposure to any individual ‘did not exceed T5% of the recommended

maximum permissible dose to body organs for a calendar quarter.

Unusual occurrences¥* were less frequent in the aluminum program
than in the zirconium program, largely because experience had been
gained in making design and operational changes. Because we anticipated
higher radiation levels from the shorter-cooled elements that were to be
processed in the aluminum campaign, lead shielding was installed in many
areas that formerly did not require it; corrective actions were taken as

problems developed.

Personnel Exposure. — Radiation exposure to personnel was due pri-
marily to the presence of 125gp, 95Zr, and °5Nb in the dissolver off-gas

 

*
An unusual occurrence is defined as one which may result in (a)

personnel exposure in excess of the maximum permissible, (b) cleanup
costs or property loss in excess of $5000, (c) an incident of public-
relations significance, or (d) exposure of the off-site population to
radiation in excess of the maximum permissible.

system and to the presence of 237y, 397¢, 103gy, 106Ry, %Mo, and 237Np

in the fluorinator off-gas and product collection systems.

The average exposure rate remained fairly constant during the pro-
cessing of dummy and irradiated fuel elements, but increased by about

a factor of 2 during decontamination (Table E-1).

During the processing of irradiated fuel elements, the maximum dose
received by an individual during a single day was 80 mrads. This expo-
sure occurred at the conclusion of run RA-W when an operator removed the
product receiver from the receiving station in cell 2 and hauled it to
the sampling room in a lead-lined drum. The product was highly radio-
active because of the unusually high 237U content. The "cutie pie"
reading of the unshielded product cylinder was 25 r/hr at a distance of
1.5 in.

During the decontamination period, the maximum dose received by an
individual in a single day was 150 mrads. This exposure occurred during
replacement of a damaged rubber gasket on the waste salt nozzle sealing
jack. Removal of the gasket was slow because the nut that held the end
flange of the drain line tightly against the gasket was located on the

underside of the gasket holder and was not easily accessible.

In summary, the maximum radiation exposure received in the alumi-
num campaign did not exceed about 75% of the ORNL limit of 1.3 rem/quarter,
or 5 rem/year. The average VPP personnel radiation exposure was about

50% of the maximum.

Unusual Occurrences. — No unusual occurrences were experienced
during the processing of dummy or irradiated fuel elements in the alumi-
num program. However, two occurred at other times: one during prepara-

tion for startup, and one during vessel decontamination.

Just before the first dummy fuel element was processed, some pre-
viously used sir-operated valves were dismantled and decontaminated in
a "hot" sink preparatory to repair. During this procedure, the hair
end the nostrils of the operator in charge were contaminated by a loose

powder found inside the valves. However, subsequent investigation

showed that the operator had received no internal exposure and only
negligible external exposure. Analysis of the incident indicated that
ea ventilated hood was needed over the sink and that a mask should be

worn vhen contaminated equipment was being opened.

After the aluminum series had been completed, a radiochemical spill
(of material that had not completely drained from a pipe) occurred
during an attempt to remove a valve bellows assembly from an inactive
HF charging system pipe line south of Building 3019. The bellows as-
sembly was needed to replace one that had failed in the combination
caustic sampling and temporary decontamination solution recycle system
in cell 2. When the valve was opened slightly (a step in the valve dis-
mantling procedure), some radioactive liquid in the pipe flowed past
the operator, as signaled by a personal radiation monitor. This liquid
continued along the pipe to a previously dismantled valve and overflowed
to the ground. The blacktop area under the dismantled valve was decon-
taminated by flushing with water, chipping, and vacuum cleaning. Inves-
tigation showed that the three people in the vicinity at the time of the
incident received no internal exposure and only negligible external
exposure.

Control of Exposure. — Radiation exposure to personnel was controlled
by taking appropriate action following thorough, frequent checking of

the work areas during the runs. High radiation backgrounds were reduced

‘by shielding vessels and pipes with lead plate, by discarding contaminated

solutions, and by backflushing filters. The number of cell entries by
operating personnel was safely reduced by using revised operating proce-

dures. The amount of radioactive material that escaped to the atmosphere

- was decreased by decreasing the purge rates and the duration of the purges.

A 35-point radiation check of the area was made at least once per
8-hr shift during each run to determine any changes in the background.

Data are summarized for runs RA-1 through ~-4 in Table E-2.

Some of the measures taken to reduce the radiation exposure are
discussed below. For example, the installation of 1/2-in.-thick lead

shielding reduced the background radiation at the caustic sampler in

cell 2 to 20% of the previous value. The same thickness of lead re-
duced the background at the NaF trap (FV-121) to about 25% of that

before installation. This same thickness also reduced the background

for the fluorinator off-gas scrubber (FV-150) to 10-25% of the unshielded
background. Approximately 1 in. of lead that was placed over the inlet
line for the caustic circulating pump (FV-L4201) in cell 2 reduced the

background to 6% of that observed earlier.

The dumping of fluorinator off-gas scrubber recycle caustic solu-
tion reduced the background for the storage tank (FV-152) to about 10%
of that prior to dumping. At the same time, the background for the
caustic circulating pump (FV-L450) was reduced by about 40 to 50%. Back-
flushing of the dissolver off-gas filter (FV-T001lC), using waste liquid
HF, reduced its background to about 25% of that noted previously.
