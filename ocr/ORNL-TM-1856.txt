INSTRUMENTATION AND CONTROLS DEVELOPMENT FOR HC. $3.00 ; MN 6 5
MOLTEN-SALT BREEDER REACTORS

J. R. Tallackson, R. L. Moore, S. J. Ditto

ABSTRACT

Instrumentation in use in the MSRE provides a good
basis for development of the instrumentation for large
molten-salt breeder reactors. The development would in-
volve primarily the testing and improvement of existing
instrument components and systems. New or much improved
devices are required for measuring flows and pressures
of molten salts in the fuel and blanket circulating systems.
No problems are foreseen that should delay the design or
construction of a breeder reactor experiment.

Introduction

ha

Operation of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) indicates
that inadequate instrumentation should not become a barrier to
further development of molten salt reactors. Most of the process
instruments are standard industrial instruments. Some of them
should be upgraded to provide the greater reliability and performance
desired in a nuclear plant. The nuclear instruments are a new
generation of solid state instruments. Normal evolution should
provide even better equipment for future reactors. Operating
experience has confirmed that some process instrument components
for direct use in the molten fluoride salt are still developmental.

A substantial program is required to convert those components

into industrial grade instruments suitable for specification by

an architect-engineer. Development of primary sensors for measuring
process and nuclear variables in a highly radioactive, high
temperature environment is ‘particularly desirable. }

The reference design of a molten salt breeder reactor (MSER)
is described in ORNL~3996 (Ret. 1). Criteria for a molten salt
breeder experiment (MSBE) and a schedule for designing and building
that reactor are presented in: TM-1851 (Ref. 2). The instrumentation
needed for those reactors has been. ‘examined by comparison with the
MSRE and with emphasis on problens associated with heating the
reactor salt systems in an oven. A program is proposed for development
of instrumentetion for ‘the MSBE. The proposal does not include
a discussion of control rods or other means of reactivity control;
this is included in - 1855, Component Development Program. A goal
of- this development is to provide instrumentation that requires only
the normal Amprovenent 1 to be. completely satisfactory for the full

scale MSER.

The following detailed discussion of these categories - - B of
constitutes a preliminary appraisal of the anticipated development
engineering needed to provide an adequately instrumented MSBE.

- Nuclear Instrument Components and. Systems

The MSRE employs two wide range counting channels end a BF3
channel for startup: control and unambiguous power measurement .
over the entire operating range of the reactor. Two linear
current channels, deriving their input signals from compensated
ionization chembers, are equipped with range changing devices
and are used in conjunction vith temperature measurements for
sutomatic control of reactor power. Three linear level safety |
channels ‘using non-compensated ionization chambers provide high
flux scram signals for the safety system.

A majority of the electronic components which make up these
nuclear instrument channels are ORNL's recently developed ine
of solid state, modular components designed specifically for
reactor control and safety. The performance of these instrument

modules, as individual units, has been uniformly excellent; the.
performance of the sub-systems or. control channels which are
formed by assembling and interconnecting the modules has been .
equally good. These instruments, in their present state of
development and measured by today's standerds, are satisfactory;
however, continuing engineering development is foreseen which will
take advantage of the rapid and continuous evolution of in-
strument and control system technology. The development of new
modules and circuits will. be required to meet those safety and
control requirements peculiar to the MSBE. In addition, it-is
anticipated that interfacing the modular nuclear instrumentation with
non-modular process equipment will require development of special |
components. The use of a digital computer in the MSBE system
will require development. of suitable interfacing equipment in
the modular line.

All neutron sensors used in the MSRE are in a water-filled
penetration whose temperature does not exceed 160°F. While
the presently available sensors are quite satisfactory in such
an environment, they could not be used without major modification
at a considerably higher temperature. Considerable development
will be required to provide sensors and’ sensor positioning

equipment capable of reliable operation in the severe temperature

environment of the MSBE reactor cell. Special shielding problems

appear to be unavoidable because of the presence of large amounts
of highly radiocactive salts circulating outside the reactor.

| Although development of control rods or other means of
reactivity control is not a part of the instrument development
program, the requirements for nuclear instrumentation will be strongly
affected. by the design and performance characteristics of the
reactivity control device used. To insure that satisfactory overall
system performance is ‘obtained. with minimum interface equipment,

these two programs must be strongly coordinated.

 

 
 

 

QO.

Process Instrument Components for Direct Application
to Molten~-Salt Loops

 

Relieble, accurate, and reasonably priced sensors to measure
flows, pressures, levels, weights and temperatures of molten salt in
pipes, tubes, and tanks will be required for the MSBE.

Several developmental instruments have been in use on the
MSRE with varying degrees of success. Performance of these instruments
has been encouraging; however, in some cases there is need for further
development to obtain improvements in performance, reduction in cost,
or both. In other cases, satisfactory instrumentation is either not
presently available or the type of instrumentation used on the MSRE
would not be satisfactory for MSBE service. In particular, the use
of the furnace type heating presently planned for MSBE reactor and
drain cells would preclude the use of some devices and techniques
that were used successfully on the MSRE. Also, the electrical :
conductivity of the MSBE sa1ts(l) will have a significant effect on ’

the type of primary sensing elements that can be used on the heated

=~

salt systems. An order of magnitude decrease in the conductivity
could preclude the use of some devices presently in use on the MSRE.
Conversely a significant increase in conductivity would result in
better performance of existing devices and possibly permit the use
of techniques (such as magnetic flowmeter) that could not be used
in the MSRE.

"It is expected that many of the problems in instrumenting the
MSBE reactor systems will be common to those encountered in instrumenting
the MSBE chemical processing plant. To avoid duplication of effort,
the development of instrumentation for the reactor system will be
coordinated with the development of instrumentation for the chemical
processing plant. Techniques and instrumentation used for measurement
of process variables in MSRE molten salt loops and areas where additional
development may be required for the MSBE are discussed in the following

paragraphs. } -

(1) Conductivities of MSBE salts are not presently known. "

Flow Measurement

The flowrate of molten salt in the MSRE coolant salt system is
measured by means of a venturi meter section. The venturi operates
at system temperature and the differential pressure developed in the
venturi is measured by a high-temperature, NaeK-filled differential
pressure transmitter. Except for some initial trouble with one of
the two NeK-filled D/P transmitters installed, performance of this
system has been adequate and this type of system would probably be
acceptable for similar service on the MSBE.

Fuel salt flow is not measured in the MSRE because there is no
acceptable flowmeter available for this service at this time. The }
system used for MSRE coolant salt flow measurements was not acceptable
for fuel salt flow measurement because of the possibility of release
of NaK into the fuel bearing salt with the resultant possibility of
uranium precipitation. This consideration might not apply to the MSBE
if the volume of NaK is very small in comparison with the volume of
salt; however, even if this objection were removed, additional
development would be required to use the venturi, NaK-filled D/P
transmitter system for measurement of fuel salt flow in either the
MSRE or the MSEE. The problems involved are common to those discussed
under Differential Pressure Measurement.

If measurement of flow rates of fuel salt in the MSBE is required,
a suitable flowmeter must be developed for this service. As mentioned
previously, the present technique might be adopted if the possibility
of a NaK release into the salt can be tolerated. Ultrasonic techniques
offer promise for molten salt measurement. The Dynasonics Corporation
is presently marketing an ultrasonic flowmeter which is capable of
measuring flows in lines from one to six inches diameter. Since this

instrument has piezo-electric transducers mounted on the transmitter

body, it is limited to process temperatures below S00°F and is probably

not suitable for use in high level nuclear radiation environment .
However, a good possibility exists that these limitations can be
eliminated by using the force insensitive .mount techniques (developed
by Aeroprojects Inc,, and used in the MSRE fuel storage tank level

probe) to permit the heat and radiation sensitive components to be
 

8

located outside the reactor containment and shielding. The resultant
flowmeter would be capable of operating at temperatures in excess of
1300°F and would be compatible with reactor environmental conditions
and containment requirements. It would be of all welded construction
and would not require electrical or piping penetration of the meter
body or of the containment vessel.

Other, less promising devices that should be considered for
measurement of molten-salt flow are the turbine and magnetic type .
flowmeters. Both of these flowmeter types can be constructed for high
temperature service and both have been used in liquid metal systems
with varying degrees of success; however, neither has been successfully
~ used in molten-salt service.

A turbine type flowmeter was developed for the ANP program and
operated satisfactorily at 1600°F for a short period before failure.
The ma jor problem in the development of & flowmeter of this type is the
high temperature physical properties of the turbine blade and bearing
materials. Although the ANP development effort was not successful, it
is possible that the use of improved materials now available, together
with the lower MSBE temperatures might permit development of a flowmeter
for MSBE service.

Magnetic Flowmeters have been used extensively at high temperatures
(1600°F) in liquid metal system and lower temperatures for measurement
of a variety of fluid flows. This type of flowmeter could not be used
in the MSRE because of consideration of containment, materials
compatibility, and molten-salt conductivity. Containment and material
compatibility considerations prevented the use of electrical lead-
"through penetrations of the meter ‘body such as used in conventional
magnetic flowmeter construction and the relatively poor (1 mho/em)
conductivity of the molten-salt prevented measurement of signal voltage
at the outside surface of the meter body as is done in liquid metal
flovmeters. If the conductivities of MSBE salts were found to be
greater than that of the MSRE salt by a factor of 1000 or more,
liquid-metal magnetic-flowmeter techniques could be used for measurement
of molten~salt flow. Development of satisfactory electrical lead-
through penetrations would permit development of magnetic flowmeters

for molten~salt service regardless of salt. conductivity.
Salt Inventory = |

Inventory of the amount of molten salt in the MSRE drain and
storage tanks is obtained by means of pneumatic weighing systems
manufactured by the A. H. Emery Company. These systems use diaphragm
type weigh cell and null balance principles and, except for some
special piping connections that permit operation under conditions of
varying sub-atmospheric environment pressure, are standard commercial
items. This type of system is inherently radiation resistant, is not
sensitive to the effects of varying ambient pressure, and is relatively
insensitive to ambient temperature variations below 150°F. The basic
principle of operation and method of installation are such that the
sensitivity and span calibration can be checked during reactor operations

- at a control panel located outside the containment and the biological
‘shield. It has the disadvantage of requiring a number of pneumatic

tubing penetrations of the containment which must be guarded by safety
block valves. Except for some difficulties with zero drift and with
some peripheral equipnent, the MSRE systems nave performed acceptably.
(Performance of similar systems used in the HRE-2 was also acceptable).
The zero shifts are thought to be caused by changes in pipe loading

rather than drift of the weigh cell system.

"Although the accuracy of weighing systems may be tii by the
zero shift effects produced by pipe loading, the weigh system approach
appears’ to offer ‘the best Possibility for accurate determination of MSEE
salt inventory in those applications where enviromental conditions
and total tank weights are such as to permit. its use. Tank inventories
could also be ‘determined by measurement of level; however, this approach

| requires the use of corrections for tank geometry and salt. density.

Also; as discussed below,” additional level system development would

be required unless measurements ‘of tank inventory are made under static

pressure conditions and unless a continuous gas purge into the tanks

can be’ tolerated.

‘It is possible that a combination of level and weight measurements

will be required to obtain a total salt inventory. Present indications
 

-10-

are that the tare.and live loads of the main MSBE drain tanks; and
the ambient temperatures in the cells in which these tanks are located,
will be such as to preclude direct use of the type of system used in )
MSRE for measurement of salt inventories in these tanks. : .
The pneumatic weigh cells used in the MSRE are the largest that
Emery has produced. Larger cell capacities are possible but a.
considerable amount of re-design and developmental testing would be
required to obtain significant increases in individual cell capacity.
Although a number of "brute force" design techniques, such ss beam
balance (leverage) systems of multiple cells with mechanical averaging,
could be used to obtain large weighing capacities, considerations of
space and cost may preclude the use of such techniques. Also, the
150°F maximum temperature rating of the pneumatic weigh cells precludes
their use in the 1200°F ambient expected in the MSBE drain tank cells.
A number of other weighing devices are commercially available
which could be used for weighing of large tanks but all of those
considered to date have characteristics which preclude or seriously
limit their operation under reactor environmental conditions. One
weigh system, offered by a Swedish company (ASEA), has considerable
promise. 2) The load cell in this system is essentially a misdesigned
transformer utilizing the magnetic anisotropy which occurs in a
magnetic material under mechanical stress. Desirable features of the
cell include its high load capacity, electrical output, solid state
structure, low output impedance, low sensitivity to temperature effects
and high output signal. The standard model ASEA load cell is not
suitable for extended service in high level radiation or high
temperature (1200°F) environments; however, available information
indicates that adequate radiation resistance could be obtained by
replacement of organic electrical insulation materials with inorganic
materials and that the maximum operating temperature might be extended
to the point where satisfactory operation could be obtained by air
cooling the load cells. However, extensive laboratory and field. testing
should be performed on radiation-resistant high-temperature equipment
before committing the reactor system design to the use of this device,
: (2) Tne ASEA system was seriously considered for the MSRE but a program

to evaluate it was abandoned because of the press of time and
procurement problems rising from the "Buy America" act.

Another promising technique (which would require development)
would be the use of a NaK filled (hydraulic) load cell. 0il and mercury
filled nydraulic systems having high load capacity and accuracy are
commercially available. Substitution of NaK for oil should permit
operation of the primary load cell at 1200°F. In this system, weight
would. be converted. to Nak pressure which would be transmitted via a

‘capillary tube to a transducer located in a more hospitable environment.

The principle in this case would be similar to that of the NaK-filled
pressure and differential pressure cells discussed below.

In some cases it may be possible to ease the requirements on the
basic weighing system bya -suitable design of the reactor system. One
possible, but not particularly promising, approach would be to bring
suspension rods through containment (with bellows seals) to weigh cells
located above the biological shielding. This approach would permit the
use of variety of basic weighing systems but would introduce serious
structural, operational, and maintenance problems. Another more promising
approach would involve weighing of a side tank rather than the entire
tank, This approach would ease the problem of load cell capacity but
not the ambient temperature problem. Possible problems with this
approach includes removal of afterheat from the side tank and elimination
of extraneous loads produced by stresses in piping connecting the side
tank to the main tank. In any case, it is anticipated that considerable

. coordination of design and development will be required to obtain

accurate inventory measurements.

Temperature Measurement”

} The temperature of heated pipes and vessels in the 'MSRE are measured
by means of mineral-insulated, Inconel-sheathed, Chramel-Alumel ‘thermo-
couples. Results of developmental tests and observation of field

performance of this type of thermocouple indicate that an initial (hot

junction) measurement accuracy of +2°F and a long term drift rate of

less than ) °F/year can be obtained at operating temperatures inthe

range of 0 1300° F if ‘couples are selected and calibrated and if
attention is paid to details during design, fabrication, and installation.

‘Errors of +8°F under static and protected conditions may result if a
 

 

12

standard grade of wire is used and normal installation practices are
followed and errors can be even greater if the couples are exposed
to moving air or are directly exposed to electrical heaters.

Since the MSBE temperatures will not be significantly greater
than those encountered in the MSRE, the materials and basic techniques
used for measurement of MSRE temperatures should be adequate for MSEE
installations. The use of the furnace concept for heating of reactor

and drain cells will, however, introduce problems which will necessitate

further development of in-cell lead-wire, disconnects, and. containment
penetration seals. Also, if accuracies greater than those obtained

in the MSRE are needed, additional development will be required.
Further development effort could also be profitably applied in the
areas of thermocouple attachment, investigation of the feasibility
and desirability of using infra-red photography or radiation pyrometry
techniques, and the measurement of small differential temperatures at
elevated temperatures.

The thermocouple attachment techniques used on the MSRE would
probably be satisfactory for most and possibly for all MSBE thermo-
couple attachments; however, the methods used on the MSRE are time
consuming and costly, and small improvements in techniques could yield
large dividends where large numbers of couples are required. (Over
1000 thermocouples were installed on the MSRE.)

Multiconductor, glass-insulated, silicone~-impregnated, copper-
sheathed thermocouple cables are used in the MSRE between the in-cell
disconnects and the out-of-cell junction boxes. These cables penetrate -
the containment and are sealed. This sealing introduced problems
because of the effort involved and because of pressure ‘buildup produced
by outgassing of the silicone-insulating materials. This type- of wiring
will not be useable in the MSBE if the furnace concept is used for
heating the reactor and drain tank cells. The expected 1200°F ambient
in these cells will require the use of inorganic insulated leadwire.
Furnace heating of the cells will also require protective sheathing
of all in-cell thermocouple viring and the development of disconnect.
devices which are compatible with the furnace atmosphere and with remote

maintenance requirements. Multiconductor, mineral-insulated, ‘sheathed -

thermocouple cable assemblies were considered for in-cell leadwire and
containment penetration service at the start of MSRE design, but this"
approach was abandoned because of high costs and the difficulty of
fabricating satisfactory end seals. The cost of this type cable is
now reduced and their use should be re-evalusted. The major problem
involved in the use of mineral-insulated thermocouple cable for
penetration of containments would be the development of satisfactory
methods of sealing the ends of the cable. Although the development
and fabrication of end seals and techniques for installation of
multiconductor cable will be much more difficult than would be the
case if thermocouples were brought out through individual penetrations,
it is expected that the reduction in the number of penetrations, which
would be obtained by using multiconductor cable will more than justify
the additional cost. However, other considerations such as maintenance
requirements could necessitate the use of individual penetrations.
Therefore, both approaches must be considered initially.

The use of infra-red photographic and radiation pyrometry
techniques offers the possibility of mapping of temperature contours
on large exposed surfaces (such as the MSBE reactor vessel). On-line
viewing of temperature distribution might be obtained by viewing a
heated system with a closed-circuit television camera equipped with
an infra-red filter. A more accurate determination of temperature
profile might be obtained by mechanically maneuvering a radiation
pyrometer to produce a’ scan pattern similar to the raster: produced

ona television screen. Since the feasibility of using these
“techniques would be strongly dependent on the physical geometry of

the system viewed and: of the surrounding area, investigation of

feasibility and development. of equipment and techniques should be
performed before the start of design of the system on the facility.

The problem of measurement of small differences in large
temperatures has not been satisfactorily solved. The accuracies
obtainable by using series-opposed (bucking) thermocouples, and.
extreme care in design and installation, are barely adequate for
MSRE purposes and might be inadequate for the MSBE. There is room

for a considerable amount of original work in this field. Several
 

 

14

commercially available, high-temperature resistance elements were
tested to determine the feasibility of using such elements for
precise measurements at high temperatures. Results were, in general,
disappointing but the performance of one unit was sufficiently
encouraging to lend support to the belief that a suitable resistance
element could be developed.

A possibility exists that differential temperatures ‘could be .
measured by use of ultra-sonic techniques. One company (Aeroprojects,
Inc.) is presently investigating the feasibility of the ultrasonic
measurement of absolute temperatures. Representatives of that company
have expressed the opinion that accurate differential tempersture
measurements could be made by means of ultrasonic devices.

Level Measurement

Several methods have been successfully used for single point and
continuous measurement of molten salt level in the MSRE. All those
methods could be used in the MSBE under similar conditions; however,
all have limitations which would preclude their use under certain |
conditions.

Continuous measurements of molten salt level in the MSRE coolant
system pump bowls are made by meens of "bubbler" type (dip tube) and
float type level systems. Continuous measurement of molten salt
level in the fuel pump bowl is also made by means of a "bubbler"
type system and a future pump installation will include a float level
transmitter. oo

Two-level, single-point measurements of molten salt level in the
MSRE fuel and coolant system drain tank are made by means of conduc-
tivity type level probes. The information obtained from these probes
is used to check the performance and calibration of the tank weighing
systems. The probe signals operate lamps (or other binary devices)
which indicate whether the level is above or below two pre-selected
points. | Co

An ultra-sonic level probe is used for single-point measurement
of level in the fuel storage tank. Except that the ultrasonic probe
presently installed is a one-level device, the information obtained

from the ultrasonic probe is. identical to that obtained from the.

conductivity type probe and is used for the same purpose.

All of the systems used for measurement of molten-salt level in
the MSRE were specially developed for the service and further development
or re-design would be required for other applications. The "bubbler"
system is basically the simplest and most versatile method of measuring
molten salt level under relatively static conditions of level and
cover gas pressure, This type of system can be used for narrow or
wide ranges and the vessel modifications required to install the system
are simple and inexpensive. However, since the "bubbler" system
performance is dependent on maintaining a gas purge flow through the
dip tube, this system can only be used where the purge can be tolerated.
Also, the response characteristics of this type system are dependent
on the purge flow rate which, in turn, is dependent on supply pressure,
cover gas pressure, and other. factors. In general, the low purge rate

. required for accurate measurement is not compatible with requirements
for fast response and fast variations in cover gas pressure, such as

can occur in the drain tanks and pump bowl during filling and draining
operations, can render the system inoperative unless accompanied by
corresponding changes in purge flow rate. The desirability of using

~ presently developed "bubbler" techniques for measurement of levels
in systems containing highly rediocactive liquids and gases is considerably

reduced by the necessity of providing adequate means to detect and
prevent the release of activity through the purge line. . Development
of a system wherein the purge gas. would be recycled within primary .
and secondary containment would greatly extend the usefulness of this
type of system.

.- The float type level system offers the best method of continuous

- measurement of molten salt levels over narrow ranges . This device is

completely. contained, has. fast response, and requires only electrical

‘penetrations of secondary containment. Present designs are limited
to measurement spans less than ten inches. The span can be extended.

but this type of device is basically more suited to low span than to

high span measurements,

The conductivity type level probe has performed well in MSRE
service. With the possible exception of redesign of the tank - |
penetration to improve containment the present probe design could be
easily adapted to installations in MSBE tanks. The MSRE conductivity
probe has the disadvantage of having (and requiring) thin walls in the
tubes extending into the tank. This type of device is therefore not
suitable for use in corrosive environments such as that in the MSRE
fuel storage tank.

The output signal obtained from the MSRE conductivity probes -
was much greater than had been expected. Since the output signal -
is much greater than required the possibility exists that a more
rugged and corrosion resistant single point probe could be developed ©
(vy increasing tube wall thickness) and that a continuous type
conductivity probe (similar to the "I" or "J" tubes used in liquid
metal systems) could be developed. An increase in the electrical
conductivity of the salt (over that of the MSRE salt) would result
in either better single point probe design or improved prospects of
using the conductivity probes for continuous level measurement.
Conversely a significant decrease in electrical conductivity could
prevent the use of the conductivity probe for either single point
‘or continuous measurement. Co

Except for some problems with oscillator. frequency drift which
caused the instrument to become inoperative, the performance of the
Aeroprojects ultrasonic level probe has been dependable and accurate.
Some additional development will be required in the area of main

ultrasonic level probe. Such a level probe would be very useful in

molten salt systems (and in aqueous and liquid metal systems) and
development of this device should be supported.

An obvious method of level measurement which should be considered
for possible use in the MSBE is the direct measurement of level by the
differential (head) pressure method. This method was not used in the
MSRE because a suitable device for measuring differential pressure was :
not available, The problems associated with measurement of differential
pressures in molten salt systems are discussed below. :

© With the possible exception of the differential (head) pressure
method, all of the methods discussed above are compatible with the
concept of furnace heating of reactor and drain tank cells. The float
type transmitter is especially attractive since the transformer and
other parts of this device not only can but are required to operate
at (or near) system temperature.- The conductivity and ultrasonic
probes might possibly be used in a furnace atmosphere in their present
form; however, some additional development work on leadwire, penetrations,

and disconnects will probably be desirable.

Pressure Measurement

Pressures in the MSRE molten salt loops are obtained indirectly
by measuring the pressures in gas purge or supply lines connected to
drain tank and pump bowl gas spaces. The pressures measured in the
MSRE are, therefore, those of the cover gas and not of the salt.

‘The techniques used for measurement of cover gas pressures in the
MSRE may or may not be applicable to larger reactors of different -
design. In any event there is no pressure measuring device available
that is suitable in its present form for directly measuring pressures
(or differential pressures) of the fuel salt. Also the system used

i could be strongly. effected by the: method of heating of lines and
vessels. The use of oven type heating would impose. the additional
‘restriction (over those encountered in the MSRE) that all components

~ of the pressure transmitters be located outside the heated zone or be.

capable of operating at the temperatures present in the oven.
Measurement of cover gas pressure in the MSBE would require

little additional development if the indirect methods can be used as

in the MSRE., However, considerable additional development would be

a
 

18

required for measuring salt pressures since part or all of the: pressure
measuring device would have to be located within containment and
biological shielding in close proximity to the pressure tap and

would have to be capable of withstanding the environmental effects

of temperature, radiation and varying ambient pressure.

~The pressure transmitters presently used in the MSRE or equivalent -

devices constructed in accordance with the same specification should

be adequate for measurement of cover gas pressure by the indirect method.

NaK-filled pressure transmitters offer the best prospects for direct
measurement of cover gas or fluid pressures in molten salt systems.
Use of this type of device would require acceptance of the possibility
of release of a small quantity of NaK into the system in the event of
a rupture of the seal diaphragm. Also, additional development would
be required to obtain adequate containment if the transmitting element
is located outside of the reactor secondary containment or to reduce
the environment effects of temperature, radiation, and varying embient
pressure to acceptable levels if the entire transmitter is located
inside reactor secondary containment and biological shielding.
Another, less promising, approach is offered by the possibility
of adapting a thermionic diode type of pressure transmitter, which is
presently being developed for use in high temperature liquid metal
systems, for use in molten salt systems. The progress of this and
other developments in liquid metal system instrumentation should be
followed to determine whether they can be applied to molten salt

systens.

Differential Pressure Measurement

With the possible exception of the measurement of pressure drop
across. the charcoal beds, all differential pressure measurements made
in the MSRE molten salt system were for the purpose of measuring flows
of gas or molten salt. No direct differential pressure measurements
were made in the liquid portion of the MSRE fuel salt system. The
performance of the differential pressure transmitters for measuring -
gas flow was satisfactory and no additional development is ‘needed in

this area. As mentioned above, some difficulties were experienced

with one of the two NaK-filled differential pressure cells used for
measuring salt flow during initial operations of the MSRE. The
performance of the other transmitter originally installed and of the
replacement for the defective transmitter has been satisfactory and
this type transmitter would probably be acceptable for similar service
on the MSBE. While two of the three NaK filled D/P transmitters
purchased for the MSRE have performed satisfactorily, the difficulties
experienced with the third transmitter and with a spare recently
purchased (as well as with procurement on all four) indicate that an
alternate source of supply should be developed. A NaK filled transmitter
is now being offered by Barton Instrument Corporation but this in-
strument is not reactor grade and performance has not been tested at
ORNL. oo

‘The problems associated with meking direct measurement of
differential pressures in the liquid-filled portion of the MSBE fuel
salt are similar to those discussed above for measuring pressure under
similar conditions. The main differences in the two problems. are
that the differential pressure transmitter is not affected by variations
in ambient pressure and usually is required to measure much smaller
variations in pressure. In applications such as level measurements where
relatively small spans might be required the effects of variations
of anbient temperature, process temperature and process pressure on
the span and zero of the transmitter are of prime importance and could
be the deciding factor in ‘determining the suitability of NeK-filled -
differential-pressure transmitters for a glven application. - For

example, determination of the inventory of MSRE drain tanks by

: measurement of level using the NeK-filled differential pressure’
transmitters presently available would not be a suitable substitute

* for the weigh system now in use... However, if the performance of the

transmitters were sufficiently improved by further development, level

~~ measurement might be considered an acceptable alternative to weighing.

- As in the case of the pressure transmitters, another, but less

promising, approach to the problem of direct measurement of differ-

ential pressures in molten~-salt systems is offered by the thermionic
diode type elements presently under development for the liquid metals

program.

Process Instruments to Operate Auxiliary Sub-Systems

These are the instruments used to measure and control auxiliaries
such as process and cooling water, cooling and ventilating air flows,
helium purge flows, ete. In most cases, instrumenting these systems
is old art and presents no problems of consequence. Exceptions arise
when system containment, remote handling, entrainment of foreign matter,
intense radiation, extreme temperatures, and very low flow rates enter
into the design. A typical example inh the MSRE is the off-gas system
discussed under Gas-System Control Valves. The experimental pump
loops and ETU which will be built and operated in the near future will
require instruments. This instrumentation, regardless of how conventional
it is, should be designed to meet the criteria and conditions anticipated
for the MSBE. The improved and tested instruments should be used on
the MSBE and the cost of the improvement regarded as development expense.

Health Physics Radiation Monitoring

The MSRE is equipped with three (3) general types of radiation
monitoring equipment. These are:

l. Monitrons to detect sources of gamma radiation.

2. Constant air monitors to detect airborne particulate sources

of gamma and beta radiation.

3. Portable beta-gamma monitors.

A total of seven monitrons are used with six of these being inter-
connected 50 that if any two monitrons indicate a high radiation level,
a building evacuation alarm is produced. Four of the seven constant
air monitors are also used in a similar coincidence arrangement. The
evacuation alarm originating from this coincidence circuitry is also
transmitted to ORNL's Laboratory Emergency Control Center where nl
appropriate emergency actions are initiated without waiting for further
instructions from the alarmed site. ‘

Several beta-gamme monitors are used to supplement the coverage
of the permanent, fixed location monitors in areas less likely to
experience excessive radiation levels. The beta-gamma monitors produce
a local alarm signal only and are not connected to the general evacuation

alarm system.

LO.
 

 

 

 

wp

21

This equipment and the way it is used represent standard design
practices at ORNL. The coincidence and switching circuitry is assembled
from modules developed specifically for health-physics monitoring
installations. These modules are in general use at ORNL and may be
interconnected to produce a wide variety of coincidence arrangements
depending on the particular installation.

. The components making up the system are, for the most part,
commercially available, No unusual criteria are anticipated for the
MSBE which cannot be met by using typical and available health-physics

instruments; hence, no development work is foreseen.

Steam Plant Instrumentation

It has been pointed out elsewhere in this report that the steam
plant which extracts power from the MSBE will -be modeled after TVA's
Bull Run system. Such a plant exemplifies the prevailing trend to
power generation with high temperature, supercritical pressure steam.

© Public utilities, TVA, and the instrument manufacturers all have
strong incentives to promote and develop the instruments and techniques
required to operate supercritical steam systems. ~ ORNL is reasonably
confident that, when the time arrives to design the system and to

specify the steam power plant instruments, this technology will be

~ approaching "standard practice" type of application engineering.

Tt is fortuitous that TVA's Bull Run plant is virtually contiguous
to ORNL and that they must, of necessity, develop a satisfactory plant.
We expect to drew heavily on TVA experience augmented by developments

‘elsewhere should they appear worthwhile.

It would be unwise at this time for us to dilute our . efforts else=
where by engaging in development, engineering for stean systen in-
strumentation. CT Tn .

} The heat exchange: interface between the steam plant and the

molten salt may provide problems. It is too early to draw firm con-
clusions but it cannot be ‘assumed that instrument design for this.
portion. of the MSBE will be routine and conventional. Design criteria,
loop and mockup tests should disclose any need to test and evaluate

critical components.
 

22

Computer Control and Data Logging

* MSRE instrumentation includes a digital data logger and computer
which is supplementing the ‘more conventional instruments making up the
primary measurement and control system.

‘The data logger collects and stores information from up to 350
field-mounted instruments of all types. These instruments are scanned
at 5-seconmiintervals and selected groups ‘of the numerical readings are
sutomatically printed on log sheets in the appropriate engineering
units once every hour, 4 hours, and 8 hours, or at any time, should
the operator so request. Out-of-limit alarms are actuated if any one
of the 350 data points goes beyond acceptable values in either the
high or low direction. If the out-of-limit point or points are critical
for good operation, the logger will scan a selected group of 6h date
points continuously at a repetition rate of five times per second until
the reactor system is again within its proper limits.

The system is programmed to compute a reactivity balance once every
hour or upon request of the operator.

Other typical programs now in use are:

1. Heat balance, oo

2. Cell average temperature,

3. Salt inventory,

4. Average reactor fuel and coolant radiator outlet tempersture,

5. Nuclear average temperature,.

6. Reactor cell evacuation volume,

7. AT at fuel inlet and lower head,

8. Fuel pump AT and minor thermal cycles.

The machine is also programmed as a temperature controller in an
experimental creep stress facility (the Surveillance Test Rig) which
is installed at the reactor site. This facility simulates and follows
reactor temperatures and temperature gradients in the environment
surrounding the creep test specimen.

The potential application of a digital computer in the reactor
control system of the MSBE will be reviewed in detail. The most
important basic questions which will require early study are:

 
 

1]

“)

23

1) To what extent should the system be controlled by the computer,
2) What will be the required reliability of the digital system, and
3) The degree and type of back-up control to be used in the event
the primary system is rendered inoperative.
| Detailed answers to the first question must be deferred until
preliminary reactor system design has been completed; however, one
basic objective may be stated. Control functions which have been

‘satisfactorily handled by conventional analog control devices will

not be converted to computer control unless there is strong economic
and technical incentive and clear evidence of technical feasibility.
Some pre- specification testing of the newer digital controllers would
be advantageous.

The assessment of the required reliability will also depend on what
exact control functions are assigned to the computer. It is likely
that high reliability will be required and consequently schemes should
be investigated which will result in a system with higher reliability
than can be obtained with a single computer. An example is a two
computer system in which the second machine is normally occupied with
logging and computation of & non-vital nature and could be called on
a priority basis to serve as a controller when the main computer fails
or is down for maintenance.

. The basic approach to these questions and ‘the detailed design
problems in general will be much better founded within the next few
months. - By mid-year (FY-68) the HFIR control computer will be installed
and the results of the preliminary control experiments will be availeble.
In addition about six months of computer and interface operating
experience will ‘have been logged. -

Computer control of the testing process, along with computer

techniques to analyze the systen loops based on the ever present process

-noise level, are attractive possibilities which should be explored.
‘Such techniques, if successful, would pay off well in terms of improved
reliability.

The application of the. Bunker-Ramo 340 computer on ‘the MSRE has
demonstrated the desirability of providing this type of on-line
 

 

2k

data acquisition and computation system to assist with the operation
and analysis of such large complicated engineering experiments. To aid
in further analysis of the benefits of on-line computers, several
experiments and demonstrations are planned to gather additional infor-
mation end verify some theories on the use of this type of computer for
process control of reactor system auxiliary devices such as heaters,
etc. : _ - ET
The shakedown problems experienced while putting the MSRE computer
into operation suggest several areas which should be investigated prior
to the application of a similar computer system on the MSBE. These
potential trouble areas are all in the analog signal handling part of

the system and have to do with 1) noise rejection and filtering of the
input signals, 2) analog input signal commutation, and 3) generation

of analog output signals. Each of these problems is primarily economic
in nature and though the MSRE computer does an adequate job in these
three areas, computer system costs on a larger system such as would be
required for the MSBE would be very high if more economical ways to do
these Jobs are not found. For instance, an approximate cost to handle.
input signals on the MSRE computer is more than $100 per process variable.
A conservative estimate of the number of signals to be brought into a
computer on the MSBE would be 2000, which emphasizes the need for finding
ways to reduce the input signal handling costs.

The study of possible use of multiple small computers; instead of
one large computer should also be done with the actual application of one
of the smallest computers to a mock-up or test stand in the early part
of the MSBE program. In this way, it may be possible to avoid over-
specifying or under-specifying the MSBE computer. The actual experience.
of applying such a computer is needed |

Beryllium Monitoring
The two beryllium monitors presently in use at the MSRE are . intended
to detect airborné beryllium from systems not sufficiently radioactive
to permit detection by activity monitoring. One is an air sampling
system which requires laboratory enalysis, while the other is a nearly
continuous monitor in the radiator air stack. CL

QO.
 

 

 

25

The air sampler uses a suction pump to draw air through filter
papers located at fifteen strategically placed collecting stations.
After a suitable interval for sample collection, the filter papers
are spectrographically analyzed for beryllium content.

The exhaust air from the radiator stack is monitored and the
results recorded almost continuously by an on-line spectrograph.

This instrument, at 1-1/2 minute intervals, automatically strikes
an arc in a small bypass stream of air pumped from the. stack and the
light output is examined photoelectrically for the characteristic line

‘produced by beryllium.

Although the Filter paper sampler has worked satisfactorily,

it is limited in scope in that the information is delayed. . The on-

line monitor is a developmental device which has demonstrated. a
principle but has not provided the required degree of reliability
for this type application. - |
The MSBE will most likely employ non-beryllium-bearing coolant
salt; if so, no beryllium monitor will ‘be needed for the reactor
system. However, the ETU, the chemical processing plant, and the
fuel processing facility will have large amounts of beryllium.
Consequently there exists a need for a monitor having better
performance than can be obtained from those presently in use.
Development work will be continued toward | achieving a ‘reliable

continuous on-line monitor.

Component Test and Evaluation

General

New devices are continuously appearing on the market, yet there

is no general program for testing and evaluating these devices at

ORNL. General Electric, Motorola, Taylor and Minneapolis-Honeywell
are now offering systems which are in strong competition with the
Foxboro ECI system used extensively in the MSRE. We must know more

about these systems if we are to ‘evaluate bids properly and assure

~ ourselves that the components and instruments selected are the best

choice for the job.
 

26

Electrical Control Circuit Components -

Performance of all reactor systems is strongly dependent on the
performance characteristics of all components of electrical control
and alarm circuit. Reliability is of particular importance since
the large number of control circuit components dictates that the
reliability of each individual component be extremely high in order
to obtain an acceptable overall system reliability. Poor system
reliability will result in frequent shutdowns which in turn will.
result in low plant availability. . To insure that adequate control
component performance will be obtained a program of test and evaluation -
of control components is needed, The scope of this program would -
include testing and/or evaluation of such components as relays, control
switches, wire terminals, connectors, indicator lamps; and annunciators.

Helium Flow Elements
In the MSRE, matrix type flow elements are used for measurement
of ges flows and capillary tubes. are used for restrictors. The

performance of these devices has been very good; however, the procurement

or fabrication of the devices required a great deal of engineering
labor. A number of laminar flow elements are available commercially
for a reasonably wide range of gas flows. These devices should be
investigated to determine whether they would be an acceptable substitute
for the devices now in use and whether they offer any significant
advantages.

Gas-System Control Valves

Helium purge flow and cover-gas pressures in the MSRE are
controlled by means of throttling valves. Due to the very low flows
and pressure drops involved, the clearances: in’ ‘these. valves are
extremely small. These small clearances together with a lubricant
problem were the apparent causes of trim galling which ‘caused failures
of a number of valves in MSRE service. The jubricant problem results
from the need for cleanliness and from the lack of any lubricant in
the dry helium which flows through the valves. Improvements have ‘been

made in valve assembly procedures which have resulted in a reduction

 
 

 

4

-y

27
in the failure rate, but additional effort should be spent on developing
better valves for control of small helium flows.

‘MSRE operating experience with the off-gas system revealed a
possible future need for the suitable means to control very low’ flows

‘of helium contaminated with solid particulate material and with hydro-

carbons, in all phases, originating with the salt pump lubricant. It

is a foregone conclusion that conventional valves and flow elements

will clog and stick in this service. Unless it is certain that the
MSBE will not generate similar flow and pressure eontrol problems, a
solution is required. ‘Three lines of attack are ‘suggested: Pirst
(and best), eliminate ‘the ‘problem at its ‘source; second, develop
‘valves which will do the Job; third, develop other, and. ‘probably
unorthodox, methods of handling small flows of dirty helium.
Development work on these problems will be done in cooperation with
the program of development and testing t the > off-gas system.

Temperature Scanners
A scanning system was developed for use in scanning temperatures
on heated pipes and vessels in the MSEE, ‘displaying a profile of the

temperature on a cathode ray oscilloscope and producing an alarm if

‘any temperature is outside the pre-set limits. Similar or equivalent

systems will undoubtedly - be desirable for the MSBE.
The performance of the MSRE system has been very satisfactory.

~ The signals are scanned by 8 mercury Jet ‘commutator switch. Since

the commutator switch used in “the MSRE is no longer commercially

“available, another source of supply of switches or an alternative
. scanning device must be developed if: this type systent 15" lsed on the
 MSEE, The use of reed relay’ or transistor switches for this service

- offers promise and ‘should be investigated. The use of solid state :

commutators or. multiplexers is increasing. It is 1ikely that all

. the components required to assemble a scanning system will be

commercially available in the near: future, In developing a suitable
‘scanning system for the MSEE, “the test loops | and mockups of the reactor

system can be used advantageously.
 

 

28

As an alternative to the MSRE type scanning system, or an
improvement, the feasibility of using a computer data-logger system
for scanning temperatures should be investigated. Comparison of
the two methods should be based on considerations of cost and

operational requirements.

Containment Penetration Seals Co
Electrical instrument signal penetrations in the MSRE were made
by means of mineral-insulated cables; by sheathed, glass-insulated,

silicone-impregnated multiconductor cables with soldered hermetic
seals inside the cell and with organic seals outside the cell; and
by hermetically sealed connectors welded to the containment vessels.
Labor costs to install these seals were high and their performance
has been marginal. The techniques used on the MSRE could be used on
the MSBE if environmental conditions were similar; however, development
of new techniques would probably be required if large systems were
heated in an oven rather than by heaters attached to the equipment.
The amount of effort required to develop satisfactory seals for
contained, oven-heated, areas will be strongly dependent on the
design of the containment vessel and the oven. Extensive seal
development will be required unless the design is such that the

oven wall is not the containment wall (i.e. unless seals can be
located in a cool area). As a minimum, a different type of seal
will be required for thermocouple penetrations since the type of
leadwire cable used in the MSRE is not compatible with the oven
heating concept. In any event, a program is needed to study and
develop better methods of making electrical penetrations into the
containment and to evaluate hardware.

Temperature Alarm Switches

A number of alarm, interlock, and control actions in the MSRE
are accomplished by means of bi-stable magnetic amplifier-type switch
modules that were manufactured by Electra Systems s Inc. A considerable
amount of trouble was experienced with these devices during initial
operation of the MSRE. Investigations showed that several defects

QO.
 

 

 

»r

29

existed in the modules and modifications were made in all modules.

At this time, the performance of the modules is being observed
to determine whether all causes of troubles have been eliminated.
Regardless of the results of these observations, there is need for
significant improvement in the design of sensitive switches of this
general type. For example, a sensitive switch providing a null
balance type high impedance input with cold junction compensation
should be made available. Since Electra Systems does not offer the
unit anymore, we should develop other sources of supply. For critical
service, & unit constructed using the input stage of a Foxboro, EMF/I
converter and components of the Foxboro ECI switch would be preferable
to the Electra Systems module,

The MSRE has disclosed a general need for improved small signal
limit switching devices. of this general type. These switches should
be capable of being used with input signals in the millivolt and
milliampere region; operate consistently and reliably on small signal
changes and be relatively insensitive to changes in line voltage and
ambient temperature. For example, on-off limit switching in the MSRE
is desirable over a 25°F or less temperature increment at average
temperatures of 1200°F. This is only a 2% change and represents a

‘severe challenge to existing methods. As a very minimum, a program

to evaluate the state of the art as it is developing is needed.
Process Bediztion Monitoring

The radiation level of ‘many flows which enter or leave the MSRE

containment are continuously monitored. These are lines" carrying

helium, off gas, cooling water, ete. and should a monitored line
indicate excessive radiation, the usual control system action is to
close block valves as required. . .

A typical arrangement calls for two or more ion chambers in a
lead shield around the pipe being monitored. Where system safety is
involved this redundancy is carried all the way from the ion chamber
through the control system output action. When on-line testing
without system perturbation is required, the redundancy is two out of

three.
 

30

The signals from the ion chambers are amplified by vacuum tube
electrometers whose outputs are used for alarm and control signals.
The foregoing is representative of standard radiation monitoring
practice today, but it is not one which is exploiting the relatively
recent advances in solid state ‘electronics. It has the merit that
it is relatively immune to large overload signals but the disadvantage
that frequent calibration and reference point checking is required.

Based on experience at the MSRE, a substantial program to improve
process radiation monitoring methods and components is under way.

The advent of reliable solid state current sensors bas enabled the
design of a system using the pulse mode of operation of G-M tubes,
thereby eliminating the need for frequent reference level calibration
and permitting long, uninterrupted cable runs to a central control
area. A prototype has been built and laboratory tested. Complete
engineering drawings and specifications are available. This pulse
mode equipment appears to be particularly attractive where reliability
is the primary consideration.but its performance must be verified
by field testing. The materials of construction of the probe,
however, limit the environmental temperature to approximately 70°C
for the sensor.

For critical applications involving high temperatures, high
radiation levels, and wide variations in radiation levels, the ion
chamber-current mode instruments will still be used. Modernization
by conversion from vacuum tube to solid state electrometers and
provision for analogue to digital output conversion is required.

The need for better ceramic to metal seals and their application to
ion chambers has been established. Better vacuum seals, coaxial
connectors and radiation resistant high temperature cabling methods:
are required to provide economical, low maintenance, long lived,

process radiation monitoring systems for the future.

Waste Effluent Monitoring

 

Some high level, intermediate level and low level aqueous wastes will
be produced at the MSBE site. Standard practices will be used for

QO.
 

 

 

 

 

 

«ft

3%

handling these wastes. Standard monitoring instrumentation such as.
that in common use at ORNL should be adequate. Gaseous effluent
(off-gas and cell ventilation) will be disposed of through a stack.
Standard packages for disposal stacks are available and will be used,
but the nature of the installation would seem to make the final

‘development of an additional device necessary.

The present scheme is to pass a sample of stack gas through a
paper filter, a charcoal trap and a clean shielded volume in succession.
Each of the devices is continuously monitored by a B-y detector and
the filter. is also continuously monitored for alpha activity. This
scheme separates the effluent material into a particulate component,

a volatile component (adsorbable on charcoal) and a component which
is rare gas. In case of a burst of activity, this system furnishes
the first information as to the source and the extent of the incident.
A sample taken directly from the stack is next analyzed in a lab for
more definite information, The laboratory analysis may take an hour

or longer before this information is available, however, and it is ...

highly recommended that the development of & system using a detector
at the top of the stack and a multichannel analyzer be completed.
This will allow essentially instantaneous analysis of the effluent
gas and is a necessary addition to the stack monitoring equipment
for this project.
