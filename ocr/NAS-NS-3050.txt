FOREWORD

The Subcommlttee on Radlochemlstry is one of a number of
subcommlttees working under the Committee on Nuclear Science
within the National Academy of Sclences - National Research
Councll. Its members represent government, industrial, and
universlty laboratories In the areas of nuclear chemistry and
analytlcal chemlstry

The Subcommittee has concerned 1tseelf with those areas of
nuclear sclence which Involve the chemist, such as the collec-
tion and dlstributlion of radlochemlcal procedures, the estab-
lishment of speciflcations for radlochemically pure reagents,
avallabllity of cyclotron time for service irradiations, the
place of radiochemlstry in the undergraduate college program,
etc.

This serles of monographs has grown out of the need for
up-to~date compllations of radiochemical information and pro-
cedures. The Subcommlttee has endeavored to present a series
which wlll be of maximum use to the working sclentlst and
which contalne the latest avallable informatlon. Each mono-
graph collects In one volume the pertinent information required
for radiochemical work with an individual element or a group of
closely related elements.

Anh expert in the radlochemlatry of the particular element
has written the monograph, following a standsrd format developed
by the Subcommittee. The Atomlc Energy Commission has sponsored
the printing of the serles.

The Subcommittee 1s confident these publications willl be
useful not only to the radiochemlet but also to the research
worker in other flelds such as physics, blochemlistry or medlcilne
who wishes to use radlochemical techniques to solve a speclflc
problem.

INTRODUCTION

This volume which deals with the radiochemlstry of
uranium 1s one of a series of monographs on radlochemlstry
of the elements. There 1s Included a review of the nuclear
and chemlcal features of partlcular interest to the radio-
chemist, a discusslon of problems of dlssolutlon of a sample
end counting technlques; and flnally, a collectlon of radlo-
chemical procedures for the element as found 1n the lltera-
ture.

The series of monographs wlll cover all elements for
whlch radiochemlcal procedures are pertinent. Plans include
revision of the monograph perlodically as new techniques and
procedures warrant. The reader ls therefore encouraged to
call to the attentlon of the author any published or unpub-
lished material on the radlochemlistry of uranium which mlght
be included in a revised version of the monograph.

IV. Revlew of Those Features of Uranium Chemistry of Chief

Interest to the Radlochemilst.

A. Metalllec Uranium

1. Preparation. Uranium metal may be prepared by several methods:
the reduction of uranium oxldes wlth carbon in an arc-melting
furnace; reduction of uranlum oxides wlth magneslum, aluminum,
calcium or calclum hydride; the reductlon of uranium halides
wlth alkall or alkaline-earth metals; electrolytic reduction
of uranium halides; and the thermal decomposition of uranium.

iodide.
2. Physical properties. Metallle uranium exlsts In three allo-
tropic forms 223 the orthorhomblec alpha form, stable below
663°C; the tetragonal beta form which exists between 663°C and
770°C; and the body-centered cublc form which exlsta at higher
temperatures (> 770°C). The physical properties of the metal
as complled by Grainger are given in Table I. Because of the
method of preparation, impurities may be contained 1n the

metal which alter 1ts properties. Also, a number of the physi-
cal characteristics depend upon anisotropic and structural
effects, eg. thermal expansion. Therefore, 1f physical proper-
tles are pertinent to an experiment or design, 1t is best to
determine them individually for the metal used.

The changes wrought in metalllc uranium by radietion and

thermal cycling may be considerable. The results of reactor radla-

tion on the metal are: dimensional instability, surface roughening

and pimpling, warping, high hardness, extreme brittleness, cracks

and porosity, broadened x-ray diffraction lines, and decreased

3

thermal and electrical conductlvity.= Thermal cycling growth ls

similar in many respects to that caused by radiation damage.

However, dlfferences exlst, the fundamental difference belng

in the mechanism of growth. (The reader 1s directed to reference

3 for more detalled discussion of this subject.)

3. Chemical properties. Uranium 18 & highly reactlve metal, A

potentlal of +1.80 volts for the half-cell reaction, U- ut3 + 3e,

places 1t below beryllium and above hafnium and aluminum in the

electromotive force series.2 The metal forms lntermetallic

water, massive uranlum corrodes slowly wlth the formation of uran-

uranlum oxide and hydride. The diseolutlon of uranium metal 1s

discussed 1n sectlon IV-F.

IV-B. Compounds of Uranium

Uranium comblnes with most elements to form a large number
and varlety of compounds. "Gmeline Handbuch der Anorganischen
Chemie, "© which surveys the literature through the year 1935,
describes several hundred compounds. Katz and Seaborgs describe
gome of the more recently prepared compounds, principally of
organlc character, such as chelates, alkoxldes, amides, mercap-

tides, and w-cyclopentadienyl compounds.
The oxldatlion states of uranium in the comblned form vary
from II to VI. Divalent uranium compounds reported are UO and
US. Trivalent uranium compounds are more numerous and include
the hydride, nitride, seaqulsulfilde, halides and borohydride.
Uranium (III) sulfate UH(80,), has also been reported.L a
large number of tetravalent compounds are known varylng in
complexlty from the oxide and simple blnary salts to more com-
plicated organic structures. Complex salts such as 3(0N3Hg) C04 +

u(coy) 41,0 and 2(NH,),C 0, . U(C,0y), . 6H,0 form an impor-

5 .
tant group of uranium (IV) compounds. Complex salts are formed
also with heallde, sulfite, sulfate, and phosphate lone. Inorgenic

compounds of pentavelent uranium are UF5, UClg, UCl, . S0C1,, 8

UClg . po1, 2 and UF ’ xuF, 8 U0Cl4 has been reported as an lnter-
medlate compound in the chlorination of uranium oxldes wlth

carbon tetrachloride.t Uranium (V) alkoxides have been pre-
pared.2 Also, the compounds (CgHgN), UOClg and UOCl, - EtOH

have been reported. Hexavalent uranlum ls represented by

UFg, UClg, Uo, uranates, and uranyl (vost) compounds. Uranyl
compounds are the moet numerous uranium compounds and vary in

type from simple salte to complex organic arrangements. Complex
salts are formed with halide, lodate, nitrate, carbonate, cyanide,
acetate, oxalate, sulfate, phosphate, arsenate, chromate and
vanadate lons. Triple acetate salts of the form

wut (v0,),4(CHC0,) + 6H,0,
where M' 18 an alkali metal (Li, Na, or XK) and M'! is a divalent
metal (Mg, N1, Zn, etec.), are used in analytical separations of
uranium. Addition compounds, such as uo, (No

2CH, COCyH

32
represent a large number of uranyl compounds.

3 9’

Uranates and peruranates are important in the analytical

chemistry of uranium. Uranates have the general formula AMZ0 .

yUO4 or lo . yUO5. They may be prepared by different methods. 219

However, in usual analytlcel procedures, they are precipitated
from a uranyl solutlon by the addition of a soluable metal hydrox-
ide, NH,, OH, NaOH, Ca(OH), etc. The uranates are insoluble in
water but dissolve ln acids.

Peruranates® are formed when uranyl solutions containing
hydrogen peroxide are made alkaline. The composltlion of the
peruranates depends upon the concentration of the slkall and
peroxide. The following groups have been 1ldentifled:

MyU,014 - xH,0, M,UOg . xH,0, MgUs0q3 . xH,0, and M, UOg . XH,0.
The peruranates are generally soluble in water. The least aoluble
are those of the M;U50:0 . xH,0 group. The peruranetes are
soluble in dilute mineral acids.

Table IT lists a number of uranium compounds together with
thelr behavior in different solvents. The compounds listed are
primarily binery compounds or simple salte. The order in which
they appear 1s the order in which they may be found in "Gmelins

Handbuch der Anorgenischen Chemie." 6

Triposltive uranium, ut3, Evidence for the existence of

 

U3 comes from the reversibility of the U(III)/U(IV) couple.
Solutions mey be prepared by the dissolution of a uranium
trihalide or by the electrolytic reduction of a uranium (IV)
or (VI) solution. Chloride, bromide, 1lodide, perchlorate

and sulfate solutions of uranium(III) have been reported.il
They are deep red in color and unstable, with oxidation of gt3
to AR occurring and hydrogen being evolved. Strongly acidi-
fled solutions:2 or those kept at low temperatures: appear
to be more stable.

Tetrapositive uranium, gH, The existence of the TU

+
lon in solution has been confirmed by measurement of the

acld llberated on dissolving uc1y, id and by solvent extraction
studies of (Iv) with thenoyltrifluoroacetoneite and
acetylacetone. it Uranous solutlons may be prepered by dis-
solutlon of a water-soluble salt: the chloride, bramide,
lodide, or sulfate; by dissolutlonh of uranium or a uranium
compound in an appropriate solvent, e.g., uranium metal in
sulfuric or phosphoric acid; or by reduction of a uranyl
solution by chemical, electrochemical or photochemical means.
The solutions are green in color. They are stable in the
absence of alr but are oxidized by oxygen. Uranium(IV) under-
goes hydrolysis with evidence 1n the first stages for the
formation of the mononuclear specles, von™3, 13,15-18 Poly-
meric specles also are formed which apparently are not in
equilibrium with the monamer.+3:15,19 Hietanenll found that

in addition to the monomeric species, & polymer of the type

ul (oR) UIA could account for the hydrolysis of uranium(IV)
to good approximation. Table III, based primarlly upon the

summarizes the results of several studies on the hydrolysis
of the uranium(IV) ion.

Pentapositive uranium, UOS . The existence of uranium(V)

 

ion 1n solution has been.conflrmed by polarographic measure-

24-26 Support for the vo," ion comes from the reversi-

bility of the U(V)/U(VI) couple2l and from infrared? and

mente.

érystallographic22:32 atudles of uranlum and transuranlc ele-
ments, Solutions of vo, * may be prepared by dissolution of
vey 34 or by reduction of a uranyl solutlon, electrolytically
or with U(IV) ions, hydrogen, or zine amalgam,=2 The formation
of U(V) 18 an intermediate process in the photochemical reduction
of U(VI) in a sucrose solution.=2 The solutlone are unstable
and disproportionate to U(VI) and U(IV). The rate of dis-
proportionation 1s second order in urenium(V) concentration
"and first order 1n acld concentration,33:12 The vo," lon 1s
most stable in the pH range of 2 to 4.22 Tt 1s oxidized to
the uranyl lon by molecular oxygen, Fe(III) and ce(1v).12

Hexapositlve uranium, vos? . A number of physical-chemil-

 

cal measurements as well as crystallographlec, infrared and
Raman spectra studles support the existence of U(VI) ion as
vo}. 2.210 Uranyl solutions are easily prepared by dls-
solution of water-soluble salts: the nitrate, fluoride,
chloride, bromlde, lodlde, sulfate, and acetate. Other water-
soluble uranyl salts include those of other organic acids:
the formate, propionate, butyrate, and valerate; and certain
double salts such as potasslum uranyl sulfate, sodlum uranyl
carbonate, sodlum uranyl chromate, etc. Uranyl solutlons

may be prepared also by dissolution of a uranium(VI) compound
in an appropriate solvent, by dissolution of a lower valence
uranium compound in an oxldizlng medium, or by oxldatlon

of lower valence uranium lons already ln solution. Uranyl

solutions are yellow 1n color. They are the most stable of

uranium solutions. As indicated 1n preceding paragraphe, the

19
uranyl ion may be reduced by reducing agentsst or by electro-
chemical or photochemical means. The degree of dissociation
of uranyl salts ln aqueous solution varies. Uranyl perchlorate
1s apparently completely dissociated ;22 whereas, uranyl
fluoride 18 undlssoclated and tends to form dimers (see section
on complex ion formation - Tv-cp).35.36 Hydrolysis of the
uranyl lon has been the subject of extensive 1nvestigatlon.
Conailderable evidence has been adduced for the formation of
polymeric species of the type vo, (U0,) 2+. 37=AT According

to sutton, 2 formation of polymers beyond the trimer U405°"
is negligible. However, the trimer itself mey undergo
further hydrolysie with the formation of u50g (0H) ", U;0g (0H) ,,
and eventually anlonlec species. 10.41 Ahrland, 2 in his
original paper, proposed the formation of the monomer vo, (oH) *
as well as polynuclear species. In a reappraisal of the

work, Arhland, Hletanen, and s111%n3 stated that there was
no certain indication of mononuclear complexes being formed.
Rather, the experlmental data was explained on the basis

that complex lons of the type v0, [ (0H) 00, 15% were formed.
From the data it was not possible to distingulsh between a
limited mechanism in which n varied from 1 to 3 or 4 or an
unlimited mechanism ln whlch n assumed all 1ntegral values.
The authors were 1lnclined to prefer the latter. Kraus:
suggested that reactlons leading to the formation of polymers
may have a less positive value of AH than the reactlon
leading to the formation of the monomer. Consequently, the
latter process might be 1ldentified more readily at high
temperatures than at room temperature. This 1s apparently
the case as was shown by Hearne and Whitetl who determined

the enthalpy change to be 20.8 kcal/mole for the monomeric
reaction (vo 0H" formed) and 6.7 kcal/mole for the dimeric

+

reaction (U formed). Table III summarizes much of the

data avallable on the hydrolysis of the uranyl ion. Included
in the table are values of the equllibrium constant “Ky, the
constant for the formation of the monomerlc species. This
constant has been evaluated by at least seven groups of
investigators2dCs38.42,48-51 exclusive of Hearne and Wnitetl,
The values obtalned agree very well (log “x, = -4.09 to -4.70).
However, the experimental conditions226238,30 and assump-
t1ong22%238 used in some of the evaluatlons have been

46 bo

questiloned.— Also, the re-evaluatlon of Ahrland's— work
already has been mentloned, and Rydberg2: has proposed an
explanation for not detecting polynuclear specles in his
experiments. None-the-less, one must concur wlth Rydberg2L
who wrote, "---1t seems remarkable that the same constants
should be obtalned for a fictive mononuclear hydrolysis
product with different U(VI) concentrations and so different
methods of investigation---."
Complex lon formation. The abllity of uranium to form complex
ions 1n solutions 1s of conslderable lmportance 1n 1ts analytlecal
separation and determination. Hydrolysis, mentioned in the
previous section, is but a speclal case of complex lon formation.
Numerous complexes have been reported.3t However, the amount

Column one denotes the complexing ligand (L). The notation 1s explained following Table IIT.
Numerous organic complexes are formed with the uranium(IV)
lon: the acetate, oxalate, tartrate; malate, citrate, lactate,
glycolate, ete. 3% However, the amount of quantitative data
avallable on thelr formation 1s very meager. T1shkorelt has
calculated dilassoclation constants for acetate complexes on the
basis of the oxygenated uranium(IV) ion vo? belng formed. The
formaetlon constants measured for acetylacetone, thenoyltrifluoro-
acetone and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acld complexes are given
in Table V.
Pentapositive uranium. Although it appears that uranium(V)

complexes should be formed in the reduction of uranium(VI) ions

22
in complexing media,®3 little data 1s avallable.

Hexapositive uranium. Inorganio uranlum(VI) complexes
which have been identified through the formation of crystalline
salts include the fluorides, chlorides, nltretes, sulfates,
carbonates, cyanides, and phosphates. 3% Uranyl solutlons wlth
these anions present have been studied. The resulte are listed
in Table VI. A nmumber of dlecrepancies appear in the data. For
example, evidence for some complexing of the uranyl ion wlth

nitrate 216.71 and chlorid 67,76 105-1074 yng has been reported

by some investigators; but a complete lack of evidence has been

reported by others.22 Day and Powersll have polnted out that the
constants calculated by them are concentration constants rather than
activity constants. Consequently, the small complexing effect may
be caused by. the varlatlon of actlvity coefficlents with a change

in medium. Other investigators, however, who have corrected

their results to apply to pure aqueous solutlons have found some
complexing to occur with the chloride 1on.87:205-107

The type of complex formed between uranyl and fluoride lone

also 1s subject to some question. Ahrland and co-workerstO2s 104

have determined equlllbrium constants for the formation of

+ - 2-
complexes UO, F » UO,F,, UO, Fg , and UO, F), and found no evidence

for the dimerization of UO, F, for uranyl lon concentratione less

than 0.1M. Day and Powers, LL however, found no evidence for the
formation of complexes beyond U0, F 3 end Johnson, Kraus and
Young3% have reported the dimerization of UO, F,, in solutions
not very different from those lnvestigated by Ahrland, et 21.10%
Numerous organic complexes have been reported.3% Much of
the quantitative data 1s summarlzed in Table VII.
There 18 often disagreement between different investigators
concerning the nature of the complexing ligand. Uranyl-oxalate
complexes serve as an example. The oxalate lon, c,0,%, has been

proposed by some investigators 49 a8 the complexing ligand;

the bioxalate lon, HC,0,”, by otherstil:116, and Heidt®2 has

that complexes may be formed wlth both c,0,° and HC,0),~ dons and
that the amount of each formed will depend upon its stabllity and
the conditions of the experiment.

The composition of a complex 1s sometimes declded upon by
comparison with complexee heving simllar ligands. For example,

H8k -Bernatrom,=38 in her work with salleylic acid, H,A, and

methoxybenzolc acld, HB, wae able to show that complexes of the
type U0, (HA) (KE) 4, U0, (H A) (HY) _p» and UO, (HB) (EY) _, were
formed 1n the aqueous phase. (The negative subscripts indlcate
that HT was eliminated in the formation of the complex.) The
experimental date for methoxybenzolc acld was epproximated by
assuming only the complex U0, (B) (OH). For salicylic acid, the
complexes vo, (HA)* corresponding to U0, (HA) (KH) and
Uo, (HA) (OH) or UO,A corresponding to vo, (HA) (HY) _, were postulated.
It was not poselble to distingulsh between the latter two.
However, from the simllarity of the distribution curves found for the
two acldse, it wes suggested that the sallecylate complexes are
formed by HA™ ligands.

A vast amount of work other than that listed in Table VII
has been done on the preparation and identification of organic
uranyl complexes. Some of the complexing agents studled recently
include dihydroxy-malele acid, 18 triose-reductonettd:150

ketones, alcohols and tributyl phosphate. Only 1n saturated
diethyl cellosolve and in 1sobubyl alcohol is lonizatlion in
excess of 10%. The large amount of water which dissolves in
the latter solvent may account for this.

In tributyl phosphate, the dissociation of uranyl nitrate
increases as 1ts concentration in the organlc phase 1s de-
creased. At 1072M. the galt 1s approximately 40 per cent
dissociated, 189 i.e., An/120 =~ 0.L Uranyl perchlorate at
thls concentration is almost completely 1onized.162 Ion
associatlon occurs at higher concentrations, but significantly
less than for uranyl nitrate. At approximately 0.01M, the
assoclation of uranyl perchlorate 1s maximum (An/120 has a
minimum value of ~0.1) in the concentration range 1075 to 1M.
The lonization of this salt may well be aassoclated wlth the
amount of water contained within the tributyl phosphate since
the electrical conductivity 1s decreased by dehydration. L893

Jezowska - Trzeblatowska and co-workersSS have measured
the molar conductivity of uranyl nitrate in organlc solvents
that contain only water from the hexahydrated uranyl galt.
The conductlvlity was found to be low and to decrease with a
decrease of the dlelectric constant of the solvent.

Conductivity measurements of UCl1, in methyl alcohol
indicated the salt to be somewhat dissoclated.89 The
‘dissociation was found to Increase on addition of tributyl
phosphate.

Kaplan, Hildebrandt, and AderilO have classified into

results appear to be ln general agreement wlth those obtalned

The trinitratouranyl complex U0, (N05) 5” hes been studied
by a number of workers 2212, 171-173 It ia formed by the
addition of a second soluble nitrate to a solution of uranyl
nltrate in a2 non-aqueous solvent such as anhydrous nitric
acid, TL dinltrogen tetroxide, 12 acetone, 18273 methyl
1sobutyl ketone, 8 dibutyl ether,213 etc. Kaplan and co-
workerslS also report that the complex 1s formed in 16 M
nitric acid, but that 1tg formation 1s far from complete.
The negative character of the complex has been demonstrated
by electrolytlc transference experiments.l8 Its composition
has been deduced by the lsolation of solld compounds from
solutions of the type described above 2:171,172 and by the
gimilarity of the abeorption spectrum of such solutions with

that of crystalline cesium uranyl nitrate, CaU0, (No) 12.12

neasurements. 118

Infrared measurements on ethereal and ketonlc solutions

Solvation. The ipolatlon of solvated uranium salts,

163,180-182 In phase studless of ternary systema: uranyl
nitrate, water, organlc solvent, Katzln and Sullivani®3
have concluded that uranyl. nltrate in aqueous solution is
largely hexasolvated, subject to the activity. As organlec
molecules are dissolved, 2,3,4 and perhaps 6 water molecules
may be displaced, depending upon the electron-donor -capabllities
of the organic moleculea. The total solvation 1s a function

of the activity levels of the water and organic molecules.

If a particular configuration is stable enough, 1t may survive
as a crystalline solld. The particular stablllty of the final
two water molecules 18 in agreement with the results of Ryskin
and co-workersilL2 118 obtalned through infrared absorption
measurements. The abllity of solvents to displace water is
in the order: alcohols > ethers > ketones .283 This general
order of solvate stabillty 1s confirmed by heat of solution
measurements. 03 It 18 in agreement also with the order of
base {electron-donor) strengths of the solvents determined by
other means. 163,163 Methyl isobutyl ketone 18 anomalous 1n

strength would indicate. 23:83 sriputyl phosphate, according
to heat measurements, competes with water almost as well as
diethyl ether and 1sobutyl aloohol 283

The order of solvents with respect to solvate stabllity
is opposite to that with respect to the stability of the
frinltratouranyl complex. This suggests a competitlon be-~
tween solvent molecule and nitrate lon for coordination

wlth the uranyl 1on. AIL

Feder, Ross and Voge 22% have studied the stabllity of
molecular addltion compounds with uranyl nltrate. The com-
pounds were prepared by shaking uranyl nitrate dehydrate with
various addenda in an inert solvent: benzene and/or 1,2-
dlchloroethane. 1:1 molecular addition compounds were found
with uranyl nitrate and ethyl alcohol, n-dodecyl alcohol,
tetrahydrofuran, propylene oxide, mesityl oxide, tributyl
phosphate; and N,N-dlbutylacetamlide. 1:2 compounds were
observed wlth uranyl nitrate and acetone, methyl lsobutyl
ketone, cyclohexanone, ethyl acetate, 2,4-dimethyltetrahydro-
thiopene 1l,1-dloxide, B-chloroethylacetate, ethyl chloroacetate,
ethyl cyanoacetate, dlethyl ether, allyl alcohol, ethylene
chlorohydrin, and acetonltrile. Formation constants were

determined from changes 1n the aolubllity of urenyl nitrate.

36
It was shown that the stablllity of the addition molecules,
for those addenda having similar functional groups, was in
agreement with the base strength of the addend; 1.e., the

more stable the molecule, the greater the base strength

df the addend.

The average number of solvate molecules n assoclated
wlth uranyl nitrate in 1ts partition between water and
varicus organic solvents has been studled by McKay185:186
and co-workers. The value of n was found to vary wlth the
uranyl nltrate concentration of the organic phase. For
most of the solvents studled, n varled between 1 and 4.

For cyclohexane, considerably larger values were found for
low uranyl nltrate concentrations.

A saturated solution of uranyl nitrate hexahydrate
in tributyl phosphate corresponds closely to the unhydrated
disolvated compound U0, (Noy) + 278P, 268.187 Evidence for
the exlatence of the single specles 15,168,187

(1) The solubility is not appreciably temperature
dependent over the range 0-50°C.

(2) On freezing and rewarming a saturated solution, a
sharp melting-point of -6.0 = 0.5°C 1s observed.

(3) The mole ratio of uranyl nitrate to TBP approaches
the value 1:2 asymptotically under a varlety of conditions.

(4) The effect of inert diluents for the TBP on uranyl
nitrate partition coefflcients supports e& 1:2 formula, l.e.,
the partition coefflclent of uranyl nitrate varles as the
square of the TBP concentration.

Jezowska ~- Trzeblatowska, et 218° report that the
absorption spectrum of uranyl nitrate 1n tributyl phosphate
glves no indication of the formation of a stable complex.
Attempts to identify a complex specles in the concentration
range 0.02-0.06M were unsuccessful.

Heaford and McKayL09 report evidence for the formation
of UO0,(CL,),:2TBP under certain conditions. From a 10.34
aqueoul perchloric acld solution, the partition coefficient
of uranium varles as the square of the TBP concentration in
benzene. Under other conditlons, other solvates may be formed.
Jezowska - Trzeblatowska, et 2189 report the formation of a
1:1 complex between Ucly and TBP in methyl alcohol.

Tributyl phosphine oxide, like tributyl phosphate,
forms an anhydrous disolvate with uranyl nitrate.187 Healy
and Kennedy+88 report a number of other neutral organophos-
phorus solvents which form solvates wlth uranyl nitrate.
Most, but not all, of the solvates reported are anhydrous.
All of the solvents extract uranium from aqueous solution
in proportion to the square of the solvent concentratlon
(in benzene). However, not all solutions of the solvent in
benzene and saturated in uranyl nltrate give mole ratios of
solvent to uranium of 2:1. For the two diphosphanates and
one pyrophosphate studled the mole ratlos were 1:1. This
may be indicative of chelation or polymer formation. The
mole ratio in triphenyl phosphate was ~22:1. This is
probably the result of the solvent being unable to dlsplace
water from the coordination sphere of the uranyl 1on.188

Solvate formatlon. between uranyl salts and acld orgasno-
phosphorus compounds, eg. mono- and di-alkyl phosphoric acids
has been the subject of some investigation.30:158,159,188
1:1 complexes between uranyl nitrate and mono-~ and di-butyl

phosphate and mono- and di-amyl phosphate in ethyl alcohol

have been reported. In explanatlon of diatrlbutlion data

38
in conjunction with 1soplestic and vlscosilty measurements,
| Baes, Zlngaro and Colemant28 have hypotheslzed that uranium

(VI) 1s extracted from aqueous perchlorate solutlons into
n-hexane solutions of di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phosphate, HL, as
the speciles Uo, (HL) JL, As the uranium concentration of
the organic phase 18 lncreased, there 1s strong evidence
that polymerization occurs.228 Similar conclusions have been
made by Dyrssent22 on the basis of the distribution of uranium
(VI) between aqueous perchlorate solution and dibutyl phos-
phate, HK, in chloroform. In hexone, the species UO, (HK) 5K,

and UO K, have been 1dentified.222 The extraction of
uranium (VI) by dibutyl phosphate from aqueous nitrate
solutions into benzene has been studled by Healy and Kennedy.198
In additlon to the species Uo, (HK) ,K,, the polyuranyl specles
(Uo K

2HK and the nitrated specles Uo, (No - 2HK have been

2)x 3)2
postulated to explaln the shape of the extraction curve as a
function of nitric acld concentration.

It has been postulated that the formation of mixed sol-
vates or solvated chelates enhances the extractlon of uranium

into certaln solvent mixtures. These systems are dlscussed

in a later section on solvent extraction. .

IV-D Separation of Uranium

 

A number of review articles have been written on the analyti-
cal chemistry of uranium.8:3%,189-200 These, together with many
texts on chemical analysis (see, for example, references 201-209),
serve well as guldes to the separation and puriflcatlon of the ele-
ment. More specialized surveys have been made by Hecht222 on the
quantitative mlcro-analysis of uranium-bearing minerals, and
by Lawrowsk1ZE on separation processes for the recovery of
nuclear fuels.

Two general techniques are avallable for the separation of

uranium. (1) Uranium 18 removed from solution 1n the presence

39
of contaminants by precipitation, solvent extraction or some
alternative method. (2) Uranium is kept in solution and contam-
inants are removed. These techniques are facllltated by the
fact that uranium 1s reasonably stable ln two oxidation states,
(Iv) and (VI), and that complex formation mey be effected to
prevent the removal of either uranium or contaminant from solution.
In the followlng paragraphs, the eeparatlon of uranium by
precipitatlon, solvent extraction, and ion exchange are described
1n gome detall. Reference 1s made also to other methods of separa-
tion: chromatography, electrodeposition, volatilization and

pyrometallurgy.

1. Precipitation. In classlcal systems of analyels, uranium
1s 8a member of the third group of elements. | That 1s,
1t 1s not precipitated by hydrochloric acld or by hydrogen
sulfide in an acidic solution, but 1t 1s preclpltated by
ammonium hydroxide or ammonium sulfide (see references 204,
206, 208, 213). Unfortunately, for the separation of
uranium, many other elements also are preclpltated by the
same reagents. However, there exlsts a large number of
reagents capable of preclpltating uranium over a wilde range
of pH. These, combined wlth Judlclous use of the two oxidation
states and/or the complexing ability of uranium, may be used
to provlde reasonably pure uranium deposits.

Precipitants. With the advent of nuclear energy as a

Precipitation of
uranium with ammonium, sodlum, or potasslum carbonates 18 not
very satlsfactory. Highly soluble carbonate-uranyl complexes
are formed. Under proper conditbns,the metal uranyl -tricarbon-
ate salts M,U04CO )zare formed. The solubllitles of the
respective ammonium, sodium, and potassium selts in water

y218

are s0(15°¢c) ,22% 150(RT),222 and 71(18°C grams per

liter. The solubllity of the potassium salt in a 50% solu-
tion of potasslum carbonate 1s 0.200 grams per 11ter.22L
The solubllity of the sodium salt 1s decreased by Ilncreasling
temperature and by lncreasing sodium salt concentration.223
Te¥ak2:l has studied the precipitation of uranium by
ammonium and sodium carbonate. From a 0.043N uranyl nitrate
solution, precipltatlion wae obeerved to be maximum in the
region of 0.1N precipitant concentration. Two maxima were
observed for ammonium carbonate; one for sodium carbonate.
Above and below these fairly narrow regions of precipitant

concentration, uranium enters into solution.

The uranium (IV) salt, NagU(CO5)g + 11H,0 1s precipitated
from reduced carbonate solutions at high uranium and carbonate
concentrations.3

Barium uranyl carbonate salts are reported to be very
insoluble.23 However, 1n the presence of carbonate solutions
the alkaline earth salts are unstable according to the
reaction,23

M,U0,(C05)5 (5) + 2003" = [00,(C05) 51%" + MCO5 (oye
Tezak2il has found the preclpitation of uranium to be nearly
complete when the barium:uranium ratio is greater than 600
and the excess carbonate 1s leas than four times the barium
concentration.

A suspension of barium carbonate may be used to pre-
clpitate uranium.3%:226 Ammonium salts interfere. A
suspension of baslc zinc carbonate may be similarly used. 342227
Iron, aluminum and thorium also precipitate.

Cyanlides. Alkall cyanides form a yellow preclpltate
when added to uranyl solutions.3%

Ferrocyanides.' The addltion of potassium ferrocyanlde
to a uranyl salt solution causes the formation of a deep-
red precipitate or suspension, depending upon the concentration
of uranium. The reaction 18 used much in qualitative anal-
ysis for the identification of uranium. However, it 1s

little used for quantitative separation. The separation is

poor and there are many interferences. 3k Separatlon can be

made from beryllium ln a weakly acldle sulfate solution.228

Fluorides. Hydrogen fluoride precipitates uranium (IV)
as the tetrafluoride. The preclpitate is gelatinous and
difficult to p11ter.3t Separation 1s made from metals com-
plexed by fluoride ions, eg., tantalum and zirconium. Uran-
lum may be reduced to the (IV)-state with zinc in a solution

made sllghtly acidic.128

42
The double fluorldes, eg., NaUFg, are pparingly soluble
even ln the presence of atrong acids. 198 Separation can be
made under these conditions from Mo, Ti, Ni, Co, Mn, Cu, Fe
(1), and V (III). Aluminum precipitates as the double salt,
Na, AlFg. Iron (IIT) precipitates in part. Reduction to
uranium (IV) may be done in the presence of fluorides with
tron (r1).220:222 Rongalite (Na,H,S,0, * 2CH,0 * 4,0) also
has been used to effect reduction.232

Hydroxides. The addition of a metal hydroxide to a
solution of uranyl salts results in the formation of the
metal uranate. It has commonly been assumed that the metal
diurante, MaUp0r, 1s preclpltated by ammonlum, sodium, or
potassium hydroxide. However, experimental evidence 1ndi-
cates that the composition of the preclpltate depends upon
the coridltlons which exist during precipltatlion and upon
the subsequent treatment, such as washing, whlch 1t re-
ceives,23%-237

Ammonium hydroxide’ preclpltates uranium quantitatively
at pH 4 or greater.3+ The presence of ammonium salts and
macerated fllter paper facllitate precipitation. Separation
le made from alkall metals, alkaline eartha, and cations
forming ammonla complexes. Repeated precipltations may be
necessary to glve sufficient separation. Phosphorus, vana=-
dium, ellicon, boron, alumlnum, iron and other elements of
the armonium hydroxide analytlcal group also sare precipitated.2:2_
Complexing agente: carbonate, oxalate, cltrate, tartrate,
fluoride, etc., interfere.

Precipitation with alkall metal hydroxides 1s slmllar to
that wlth ammonlum hydroxide. Uranlum may be preclpltated
in the presence of carbonate wlth sodium or potassium hydroxide

of sufficient concentration. Carbonate lon Interference may

be removed by heating.

Todates.' Uranium (IV) 1s precipitated from an acid

solution by potassium 1odate. 3% Separation can be mede from

copper, molybdenum, and reduced vanadium.238 Aluminum 1n
amounts up to flfty times that of uranium does not interfere.
Larger amounts of aluminum and divalent iron in any concen-
tration cause lncomplete precipitation. Titanlum, zirconium,
cerium (IV), and thorium precipitate with 1odate.3%

Mercuric oxide. Uranium 18 preclpltated when a
suspension of mercurlc oxide 1s bolled in an aqueous solution
contalning ammonium chloride.3% Separation 1s made from
alkali metals and alkaline earths. Hydroxy acids interfere.

Peroxides. Hydrogen peroxide preclpltates uranium
peroxide, uo, . xH,0, from slightly acldlc solutions. The
reaction occurs in the pH range 0.5-3.5. The optimum range
1s 2.0-2.5. Hydrogen lons released wlth the formation of
uranium peroxlde are neutrallzed wlth ammonia or ammonium
acetate. Complete preclpitation requires an excess of
hydrogen peroxlde. Quantitative separatlon may be effected
by freezing the solution, allowing it to stand, and filtering
at 2°C. The separation from most elements 1s good since 1t
1s done from an acidic solution.3%2232 Plutonium, thorium,
hafnium, zlrconlum, and vanadium also preclpltate. Iron
interferes by catalytically decomposing hydrogen peroxide.
Small quantities of iron may be complexed with acetic, lactle,
or malonlc acid. Low ylelds may result from the use of
malonlic acid. Ammonium, potassium, and alkaline earths re-
tard the rate of precipitation. Complexing ions such as
oxalate, tartrate, sulfate, and fluoride in large quantities,

also interfere. Fluorlde lon may be camplexed with aluml~-

Phosphate precipitation of uranium (IV) 1s more Belec-
tlve. It 1s made from dllute hydrochlorlc or perchloric
acld solutlons. Separation is made from manganese, iron,
vanadium and most other elements. Zirconium, thorium, and,
to a smaller extent, titanium and tin precipitate, 136-198
Aluminum interferes by the formation of soluble complexes wlth
uranium and phosphate 1ons.22 With sulfate and aluminum
present, uranium 1s precipitated in a narrow pH-range around
one. At higher pH, the soluble sluminum-uranium-phosphate
complex 18 formed; at lower pH, the soluble uranlum-sulfate
complex. Chromlum ln excess of 0.2 gram per 100 milliters
causeg incomplete precipitation.198 Large amounts of fluoride
ion prevent precipitation.t28

Sodium hexametaphosphate [(NaP05)g) also precipltates
uranium (IV) from acid solutions.240 Adherence to falrly
stringent condltlons allows for complete precipitation. A
3N.K310, solution of uranium (IV) 1s heated to 60-70°C. If
more than 2 mg. of uranium are to be precipitated, a freshly
prepared 2% hexametaphosphate solution 1s added until its
concentration in the precipltating medium is 0.30-0.35 per
cent. To preclpltate smaller amounts of uranium, a 0.5
per cent solution of thorium chloride ls added as carrier

‘and the hexametaphosphate added until it 1s in excess 25 per

cent wlth respect to the thorium, i.e., molar ratio of Th:PO4

45
is 1:5. Coagulation 1s lmproved by heating in a water=-bath
for ten to fifteen minutes after precipitation. Under these
conditions separation is made from V (Imm) and (IV), Fe, Cu,
and other di- and trl-valent metals. Incomplete precipitation
occurs wlth Increased or decreased acldlity -- probably because
of enhanced solubllity of the compound and complex formation,
respectively. Precipltation from sulfuric acld 1s incomplete
Pecause of uranium-sulfate complex formation. Under certaln
conditions both uranium (IV) and (VI) form complexes wlth
hexametaphosphate.

Hypophosphorilc acid (HyP,0¢) , sodium dihydrogen hypo-
phosphate (Na, H,yP,06) and sodium pyrophosphate (Na, P50.)
precipitate uranium (IV) from acid solutions. Other
tetravalent metals, Tl, Zr, and Th, also precipitate. Separa-
tion is made from uranium (VI) and trivalent metals in general.

Phosphites. Sodium hypophosphite (NaH, P0,) and ammonium
thiosulfate or sulfurous acld precipitate uranium from a
boiling, dilute acid solution.24L Zirconium and titanium
precipitate under simllar conditions. These elements may
be separated prior to uranium by boiling with sodium hypo-
sulfite alone. Elements forming acid~insoluble sulfides
are removed wlth hydrogen sulfide before adding sodium hypo-
“phosphite and ammonium thiosulfate.

Sulfetese. Uranium (IV) sulfate 1s practically *neoluble
in 47 per cent perchloric acid. Precipltation is made in a
sulfurlc acld medium. Uranium 18 reduced on a mercury cathode
and concentrated perchloric acid 1s then added.

upon the hydrogen lon concentration. It does depend upon the
vanadium : uranium ratio present in solution. Compounds

fluoride, sulfate, and large amounts of phosphate lons inter-
fere. Uranium 1s preclpltated from 2-3N hydrochloric acld
media. At lower aclditles other metal oxalates precilpltate,

eg., Fe(II), Zn, Cu. At higher acidities the solubllity of
uranium (IV) oxalate Increases. Immediate filtration of the
precipitate may result in losses up to 1% of the uranium to
the filtrate. Recovery of uranium may be made more quantl-
tative by chilling the solutlon and allowlng 1t to stand.
Small amounts of manganese, iron, and nlckel may be carried
wlth the precipitate. Nloblum, the rare earths, and thorium
precipitate under similar conditions. If uranium 1s reduced
on a mercury cathode prior to precipitation, no cations in
moderate amounts interfere except rare earths and thorium.

Precipitation of uranium can be made ln cold 1N nitric
acld solutions.232 The uranium content should be less than
70 grams per liter. Enough oxallc acid 1s added to glve a

Sodium acetate precipltates sodium uranyl acetate from

in sodium acetate 1s about 100 mg per liter.276 Neptunlum

a neutral or weakly acidic uranyl salt solution precipitates
the triple salt, sodium zinc uranyl acetate.183

Tannic acid (digallic acid)’ and tannin (a glucose ester
of tannic acid)’ react with uranium (VI) to glve a deep-brown
precipitate. 3% Elemente arranged according to decreasing
eage of preclpltation by tannin are Ta, Ti, Nb, V, Fe, Zr, Hf,
Th, U, a1.212 The poslitlon of chromium in this serles 1s
uncertaln. Tantalum, titanium, and niobium may be separated
by tannin in‘a slightly acidic oxalate solution. Uranium and

others are precipitated by adding more tannin and by making

57

such solutions in the presence of Frbonate, acetate, or tartrate
1ons.222

Thiosinamine. Uranium and cadmium are preclpltated when
‘an alkaline solution containing these elements 1a bolled with

Carriers. Trace amounts of uranium may be removed from
solution by the use of gathering agente or carriers. The
cholce of a particular agent depends upon the conditions
under which precipitation 1s to be made and upon subsequent
chemistry to whlch the precipltate is to be subjected.
Rodden and ware3t have deseribed the applicatlon of several
carriers: ferric, aluminum, and calclum hydroxide. The use
of barlum carbonate and thorium hexametaphosphate has been
mentioned in the section on 1lnorganic precipltants. Mag-
nesium oxlde and thorium psroxide have been used. 32 The
oxlde and salts of antimony, 282.282 calcium fluoride,3t
and the phosphates of zirconium, +27 bismuth,283 and thoriumt2ls
240 have been used to carry uranium from reduced solutions.
Uranium (IV), in general, should behave simllarly as nep-
tunium (IV) and plutonium (IV). These are carried by
lanthanum fluoride, cerlc and zlrconium lodates, ceric and
thorium oxalates, barium sulfate, zlrconlum phosphate, and
bismuth grsonate. 218 Uranium (VI) does not carry wlth these
agents providing the concentration of either carrler or

uranium 1s not too large.

Complexes. The preclpitation of uranium in normally

 

precipltating medla ie inhibited by the formation of

soluble complexes. 3% Carbonate lon 1B a very efficient
complexing agent of uranyl lon. In ammonium hydroxlde

solution, uranium can be separated from iron, titanium,
zirconium, and aluminum with carbonate lon present. In ammonium

sulfide solutions, carbonate lon makes possible the separation

58
of uranium from manganese, lron, cobalt, zinc, and titanium.
Ammonium carbonate prevents the precilpltation of uranium with
phosphate. Preclplitation wlth sodium carbonate makes possible
the separation of uranium from beryllium, manganese, iron, cobalt,
nickel, zine, titanium, zlrconlum, and the alkaline earths.

SodIum peroxide facllltates the separation of uranium and
other metals with sodlum carbonate. The addition of the per-
oxide alone to acid solutions of iron, cobalt, rare earths,
titanium, zirconium, hafnium, and thorium causes thelr preci-
pitation while uranium, 1f present, remains in solution.

Uranium does not precipitate with tannic acld in slightly
acldic solution wlth oxalate lon present. Titanium, nlobium,
tin, tantalum, and tungsten are preclpitated under such con-
ditions. Oxalate lon also interferes ln the preclpltation
of uranium by ammonia.

Tartrate, cltrate, and malate ions prevent the precipi-
tation of uranium by ammonlum hydroxlde or sulfide.3%

Sallcylle acid and hydroxylamlne hsve both been used to
complex uranium ln separations from rare earth elements. .3t
Hydroxylamine has been used in separations between uranium and
beryllium, aluminum, lron, and thorium.3%

Complexling agents that form weak complexes with uranium
and relatively strong complexes with other metalllc lons make
separatlon possible between the two: uranlum ls preclpltated
by a sultable reagent; the other lons remaln in solutlon.
Ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (complexone .II) and 1ts
disodium salt (complexone III) have been used successfully
in this respect. Uranium has been precipitated with
emmonla in the presence of complexones wlthout lnterference
from Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, 2n, C4, La, Ce, Hg, Pb, Bi,
and the alkellne earths. 284 The recovery of uranium 1s not
entirely quantitative slnce the complexing agent lncreases

the solubllity of the ammonium uranate.128 28 The absorp-

59
tion of impurities 1n the precipitate may necessitate
dlssclution and reprecipitation of the uranium. 198 Berylll
and titanium follow the uranium chemistry .288 |
Quantitative recovery of uranium from the aforementioned
cations: Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, etc., can be made with ammonium
monohydrogen phosphate, (NH ) HPO), in the presence of
ethylenediaminetetracetlc ac1d.285.287 Beryllium and
titanium agaln interfere. Small amounts of titanium may be
complexed wlth hydrogen peroxide before the addition of

other reagents .28L

Sen Sarma and Ma111k288 have studied the separation
of uranium from other elements using 8-hydroxyquinoline (oxine)
as preclpltant and complexone III as complexing or masking
agent. It was found that complexone had no masking action
on uranium in the pH range 5-9. In a solution buffered wlth
scetle dcld and ammonium acetate et pH ~5.3 quantitative
separation was reported between uranium and Al, Mn, Fe(III),
Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Zr, C4, rare earths, Pb, Bi, Th, and Py05-
In ammoniacal medium at pH ~8.4, a simllar separation was made
from V50s, MoO, and Wo5: Steele and Taverner,128 however,
were unable to duplicate the above results.
Solvent extraction. The solubllity of uranyl nitrate in
organic solvents has long been recognized.182 The ability
of dlethyl ether to extract this salt has been used in
systems of anelysls for many years. However, 1t 1s only
within recent years (starting in the 1940's) that widespread
use has been made of solvent technlques as a means of
separating and purlfylng inorganic substances in general 289-299
and uranium in particular, 12L:192,19%4,197-199, 300-305

The conditlons under which uranium may be extracted are
many and varled. In the present paper, extraction from

aqueous solutlon 1s considered. However, extraction from

solid phases322-397 and slurries3®2 has been investigated

60
and a favorable uranium partition has been found. Conditions
whlch affect the extraction of uranium from aqueous solutlon
by organic solvent are the composition of the aqueous phase,
the nature of the organic phase, the temperature, and the
time of equllibration. In the aqueous phase, such factors
ag uranium, acld, common anion, forelgn anlon, and foreign
cation concentration must be considered. The nature of the
organic phase depends upon the type and concentratlon of
solvent and dlluent. If the organic phase 1s not 1nitlally
barren, lte concentration of uranium, acld, etc., affects
partition.

Because of the number of variables and the large number
of uranlum solvents, one cannot conelder, in a volume of this
glze, each solvent in the light of each variable. Indeed,
the behavioral relation between solvent and the afore-men-
tioned varlables 18 known for only a few well-studled solvents.
The purpose of the present paper 18 to provide information
on the conditions best-sulted for the quantitative extraction
of uranium or for the separation of uranium from interfering
elements. This 18 done as much as possible in graphic or
tabular form.

The solvents are divided into flve general classiflcatlions:
1) ethers, esters, ketones, and alcohols; 2) organo-phosphorous
compounds; 3) amines and quaternary emmonium salts; I) carboxylic
aclds; 5) chelating agents. Dialkylphosphorlc aclds, eg.,
dibutyl phosphate, are classified as organophosphorus com-
pounds rather than chelating agents. Carboxylic acide are
classifled a8 Buch, although some may also be consldered
chelating agents, eg., sallcyllc acid. A number of extrac-
tants may serve also as diluents or secondary solvents for
other extractants. Such systems are described under the
primary extractant. For example, & cupferron-hexone system

is described under "cupferron'" rather than under "hexone!

61
In the discussion, the terms "extractant" and "solvent"
are often used interchangeably. '"Diluent" 1s used to describe
a secondary solvent rather than the term "lnert solvent." The
cholce of dlluent may appreclably affect the partition of
uranium. A number of terms that are frequently used are
defined below.

Partition or extraction coefflclent:

Equllibrium laws. The physical chemical principles

Involved in the solvent extractlon of uranyl nitrate have

been summarized in references 308-312. Detalled methods
of treating the varlous equlllibria lnvolved have been
devised. t11.313-315 A more simple approach, adapted from a
paper by Carlesons x 18 herewlth presented.

It may be assumed that within a certaln concentration
range an average uranium complex 1s extracted. The complex
is representative of a whole set of complexes and may be
written HC Ly) (50), - (8),- M*®, in this case,
may be ut” or uo?. L, as written, is a singly, negatively

a solvent molecule. The subscripts y, h, and n need not be
Integers. The reaction for the extraction mechanism may be

Information concernlng the extracted specles may be obtained
by measuring the partition coefflclent whlle varying the
concentration of only one of the quantities. A knowledge of
the activity coefficients 1s then requlred or the product of
the activity coefficlents 1n both phases must be kept constant.

As stated previously, the above approach to solvent
extraction is a simplified version. It represents only an
average extracted species. Among other things, it does not
conglder the effect of water activity in the organlc phase,
solvent activity in the aqueous phase, complex formation be-
tween the varlous components in elther phase, or the formatilon
of polynuclear species. These effects may be large or small
depending upon the solvent, aqueous medium, and uranium con-

centration involved.

ETHERS, ESTERS, KETONES, AND ATCOHOIS., Uranyl nitrate

 

18 extracted by many polar solvents which contain donor

oxygen atoms such as ethers, esters, ketones, and alcohols. 16-320

\

63
Extractlon from water solutions 1s small unless the uranium
concentration 1s appreclable. This 18 shown in figures 1-5
in which the data of McKay and co-workers, 1182185 Warner ,32%:322
and Vesely, et a1323 are plotted. In general, it has been
observeda2t that:

1) the extraction coefficient of uranium decreases when
the number of carbon atoms 1ncreases for a glven homologous
series of organlc solvents,

2) for a molecule with a given number of carbon atoms
and a glyen chemical functional group, solvents with straight
chalns are more efficient extractants than those with
branched chains,

3) one or more double bonds in a molecule increases the
efficlency,

4) primary alcohols are more effliclent than secondary
ones,

5) the coefficlent of extractlon increases wlth the
solubility; but there 1s no well-defined relation between
the two. | |

Evidence considered in the sectlon on non-aqueous sol-
utions indicates that uranium 1s extracted from aqueous
nitrate solutions as hydrated, solvated uranyl nitrate,

U0, (N04), (Hy0)y 5, Under appropriate conditions, the
hydrated, solvated trinitrate-uranyl complex may be extracted.
The relatlonshlp between partition coefficlent and equilibrium
constant for the extraction mechanism shows the extraction of
the former species to be favored by large free nitrate and
free solvent concentrations and by smell water activity.

Effect of nitric acid. The addition of nitric acid to

 

the aqueous phase favors the extraction of uranlum by pre-
venting or decreasing the hydrolysis of uranyl lon and by
increasing the nitrate ion concentration.32% Nitric acid

1s extracted also by the organic solvents. This requires

not deslrable. The formatlon of HNO, . Sp complexes reduces
the amount of free solvent, the extraction of other elements
1s enhanced, and the danger of an explosive reaction between

Effect of nitrate salts. The nitrate lon concentration

far from complete, even 1n 16 M HNO

 

may be lncreased by the addition of metal nltrates of significant
solubllity to the aqueous phase. Thls not only promotes the
extraction of uranium but also the extractloen of other elements
whose nitrates are soluble 1n the organic solvent. In some
cases, nitrates whlch serve as saltlng-out agents, eg. thorium
may also be extracted in significant amounts. The extraction

of other salting-out agents, eg., ceslum, may be enhanced

by the formation of uranyl trinitrate complexes, MUO, (NO, ) 5.222
The ability of varlous nitrates to salt-out uranium has been
related to the hydration of the cation, 328 the actlvity

327 and the radius

coefflclent of the pure nltrate salt,
and charge of the cation.328 A salting-out agent which 1s
highly hydrated facilitates extraction of uranium by reducing
the water activity. In figure 6, the partition coefflcient
of uranium 1s plotted as a function of aluminum nitrate

for several solvents. The partition of uranlum between

RUO, (N04) 5. 12 This 1s discussed further under "Hexone."

Effect of other salts. Anions that complex uranium

 

in the agueous phase may seriously interfere wlth the ex-
traction of the latter. Chloride, fluoride, sulfate, phos-
phate, and several organlc anions have been studled for
thelr Interference. The adverse effecta of these lons may

be minimized by removing them from solution prior to uranium ex-
traction, by complexing the anlons with cations of salting-
out agents, or by using an excess of an efficient salting-
out agent to over-ride the anion interference. The inorganic
anlons may be preclpltated as sllver chloride, lanthanum
fluorlde, barium sulfate, zirconlum phosphate, or ammonium
phoaphomolybdaete. Fluoride lon 1s complexed by aluminum

and calcium. Sulfate lon 18 complexed by ferric lon. Large
amounts of sulfate :lon are also precipitated by calclum
nitrate. Phosphate lon 18 complexed by ferric and aluminum
lone. Calclum nltrate has been used to counteract the effect
of acetate and oxalate. The effect of chloride on the
partition of uranium may be reduced in the presence of a
8trong saltlng-out agent. Chloride lon 1s more objectionable
from the fact that -1t promotes the extraction of other elements,
notably lron. In the presence of large amounts of interfering
dons, particularly sulfate and phosphate, it 1s advisable to
separate the uranium from solution prior to extraction. This
may be done by preclpltation with carbonate-free ammonium
hydroxide. The preclpitate 1s dissolved in nitric acld and
the extraction 18 inltiated. Ferric hydroxide may be used

to carry trace amounts of uranium.

Uranium may be extracted from aqueous medie other than

72
nitrate. Thilocyanate solutions have been found satisfactory.
The extraction, however, le lees selective from thiocyanate
than from nltrate solutions.

Solvent actlon. The partition of uranyl nltrate 1s
dependent upon the free solvent concentratlon. This 1s
reflected 1n the coefficients of extractlon of micro and
macro amounts of uranium from highly salted aqueous solutions.
The partition coeffleclent of trace amounts 1s larger than
thet of large amounts as a result of more avallable solvent.
As mentioned previously, macro amounts of uranium extract
more readlly from water solutions or less highly salted
aqueous solutions than do micro amounts. This effect may
be attributed to the salting-out abllity of uranyl nitrate
itself.

The extraction of other elements 1s affected also by
the uranium concentration. High loading of the solvent
by uranium reduces the extraction of less preferred complex.
specles. High uranium loading may be achleved by diluting
the solvent with a secondary solvent in which uranyl nitrate
1s 1nsoluble or slgnificantly less soluble than in the primary
extractant. Solvent dilution, 1n general, causes a deorease

“1n the partition coefficient ,.2+3.321,320,330 Wohlhuter and
Seuteron33t have llsted a number of aromatic and chlorine-
substituted dlluents ln order of lncreasing harmfulness to
uranium extractlon: benzene, toluene, xylene, carbon tetra-
chloride and dichloroethylene, chloroform. Solvent dilution
may be used also to lmprove upon the physical properties
of the organic phase, eg., density, viscosity, etc.

The sultabllity of mixtures of oxygen-contalning
solvents as extractants for uranyl nitrate has been
studied,3182320,329,330 gover and co-workers32l reported
that none of the mixtures they investigated were better than

the pure solvent. Recently, however, Fomln and Morgunovaca

73
and Vdovenko and Krivokhatsi11330 have reported enhanced
uranyl nitrate partition coefficlents from solvent mixtures.
Vdovenko and Krivokhatskii report that over ten such mixtures
have been found. Among them are: di-lsopropyl ether and B,B'-
d1ohlorodiethyl ether, dibutyl ether and 8,p' -dichlorcdiethyl
.ether, diethyl ether and acetophenone, lsocamyl alcohol and
methyl 1sobutyl ketone. The enhanced extraction by solvent
mixtures has been attributed to the formatlon of mixed gol-
vates of uranyl nitrate.322:330

Effect of temperature. The extraction of uranyl nitrate
1a decreased by a temperature inorease. The partition co-
efficlent of uranium 18 plotted as a function of temperature

for several solvents in figure 7.332

Re-extraction. Uranlum 1s re-extracted from the or~-
ganle solvents considered in this section by contact wlth
water. Several water contacts may be required if large
amounts of uranlum or nltric acid have been extracted. Water-
soluble salts whose anlons complex uranyl lon, eg., ammonium
Sulfate, facllitate re-extractlon.

‘Extraction of other elements. A number of elements
other than uranium are extracted by oxygen-contalning 80l-
vents. Those commonly found with irradieted uranium are
hexavalent Np and Pu; pentavalent Pa; tetravalent Th, Np,
Pu, Zr(+Nb), and Ce; and ruthenium complexes. Neptunium,
plutonium, and cerium are made less extractable by reduction
to lower oxidation states. Pavorable separation of uranium
from the other elements may be achleved by control of the
nitric acid and salting-out agent concentrations. Free
halogens are extraoted. These elements may be eliminated
from solution prior to uranium extraction. The halogens
also combine chemically with a number of solvents; eg,,
lodine and hexone. The combined halogen 1s not re-extracted
by water contacts. |

General survey. The extractlon of uranyl nitrate by
polar oxygen-contalning solvents has been lnvestligated under
a varlety of conditions. The results of three surveyspio=320
in which the experimental conditions were all different, are
given in Table VIII.

because of the selectivity of the extraction. Disadvantages
of the method are the high volatility and low flash point
of the solvent and the relatively low distribution of
uranium into the solvent.

The partition of uranyl nitrate between diethyl ether
and water 1s 1llustrated in figure 1.282:321 with both
. phases saturated with uranyl nitrate at 25-26°C, the dis-
tribution coefficient 1s about 0.68.328 The effect of nitric
acid upon the partition of uranium333233% ang nitric ac1a32%s
333-335 itself 1s represented in figure 8. Furman, Mundy,
and Morrison328 report that the pH of the aqueous phase
should be 4 or less for complete extraction of uranium to
occur. The influence of ammonium nitrate and calcium nitrate
upon the extraction of nitric acid 1s also shown in figure
8.328

Figurea 9 and 10 demonstrate the influence of various
salting-out agents on the distribution of uranyl nitrate.320.328
The nitrate concentratlon plotted in figure 9 includes that
of the salting-out agent plus that of uranyl nitrate left
after extraction by an equal volume of ether. The latter
contributes only a few percent to the total nitrate concen-
tration in most cases. A notable exception is the iron (IIL)
point at 1.18M nltrate concentration. In this 1lnstance,
.0.82M nitrate lon 1s attributable to ferric nitrate and
the remalnder to uranyl nitrate. The nitrate concentration
of the saltling-out agent is plotted in figure 10. Uranyl
nitrate contributes little to the nltrate concentration since
only one gram of uranyl nitrate was used per 100 grams of

inltlal aqueous solution. Furman, Mundy, and Morrison328

observed that the salting action of a mixture of nltrates
could be reasonably predicted by the following method:

The logarithm of a _ for each salt at a given total

nltrate molarity 18 divided by the total nitrate

molarity. These individual quotlents ere then mul-

tiplied by the nitrate molarity of the respective

salts. The sum of the resulting products 1s then

equal to the logarithm of the predicted partition

coefficlent. ,
Hellman and Wo1£336 have studled the salting action of
varlous nitrates 1n the presence of nitrlc acid and thorium
nitrate. Some of thelr results are listed in Table IX.
From the data 1t may be observed that (1) thorium nitrate
1s generally a less effectlve salting-out agent on a
normality basls than other metal nitrates and (2) the
extraction of uranlum becomes less efflclent as the amount
of extracted thorium becomes appreclable.

The effect of several forelgn anlons on the extraction
of uranyl nitrate by dlethyl ether 1s glven 1n figure 11337
and Table x.326 Arsenate, molybdate, and vandate lons also
interfere with the extraction of uranium. The effect of
these ion may be offset by the addition of ferric nitrate
to the solution.338

The partltlon of a large number of elements between
various aqueous nitrate systems and dlethyl ether 1s glven
in Table XI and illustrated 1n figures 12-14. The lnecreased
distribution of heavy elements and flssion product elements with
Increased nitric acld concentratlon should be noted. For a
selective uranium extraction the nitrle acid concentratlon
should be minimal. Hyde332 hes recommended an aqueous
phase 0.5~1M in nitric acld and 2.5M in magnesium nitrate
for the quantitative extraction of uranium by diethyl ether.
More selective extraction of uranyl nitrate may be made from
a saturated ammonium nitrate-solution, 0.05-0.1M in nitric
acid. The extractlon can be made quahtitative by repeated

contacts with ether.

general survey work (Table VIII), have studled the extrac-
tion of thorium and uranium by ethyl acetate, n-propyl
acetate, and 1so-propyl acetate as a function of the

nitrate concentratlon of the agueous phase. It was the
observation of the latter group3Ll that the extraction of
uranium tends to decrease with lncreasing molecular welght

of the ester. Therefore, only acetates and proplonatee
need to be consldered serlously. Increased protactinum
extraction was observed wlth increasing length of the

alcohol portion of the ester,316 It was further observed
that hydrolysis of the ester tends to lncrease the extraction
of both thorium and uranium.310 It was not determined whether
the addition of alcohol or organic acld causes the ilncreased

extraction.

Ethyl acetate

nltrate between ethyl acetate and water has been studled by

deKeyser, Cypres, and Hermann. 18% The partition coefflecient

was found to vary from 0.17 at 22% U0, (Nog), . 6H,0 in the
aqueous phase to 0.78 at 43% aqueous concentration. In
laboratory practlce, uranium 1s extracted by the solvent
from aqueous nitrate medla. The following condltlons have

been used by varlous groups to extract uranlum:

Grimaldi and Levine303. 9.5 g. of A1(NOg) 5 * 9H,0
are added to 5 ml of solutlon approximately 2.u4N
in HNO, . 10 ml of ethyl acetate are added and
shaken at least 30 seconds.

Rodden and Tregonning328. Uranium preclpltated in the
presence of aluminum (20 mg) wlth NH, OH 1s dlasolved
in 1 ml of HNO4 (1 to 1). 8 g. of Mg (N03), . 6H,0
18 added and the volume adjusted to 10 ml with water.
5 ml of ethyl acetate are added and vigorously shaken
for 2 minutes. (Used with 20-400 mg samples of U40g-)

109
Nietzel and DeSesa31:368, Approximately 15 ml of sat-
urated alumlnum nltrate solution are added to 3 ml
or less of sample containing 0.30 to 15 g. of U30g
per liter. 20 ml of ethyl acetate are added and
shaken for 1 minute.

Guest end Z4mmerman33 : To 5 ml of sample contalning
5% concentrated HNO, by volume, 6.5 ml of hot alumi-
num nitrate solution, having a bolling point of 130°C, ,
are added. The resulting solution 1s cooled, 20 ml
of ethyl acetate are added, and the mixture shaken
for 45 to 60 seconds.

Steele and Taverneri8. Approximately 5 ml of aqueous
solution are saturated with aluminum nitrate. The
resulting solutlon 1s shaken with 10 ml of ethyl
acetate for 1-2 minutes.

In the procedure of Rodden and Tregonning, 328 aluminum ni-
trate 1s used lnstead of megneslum nltrate 1f extraction

is to be made 1n the presence of phosphate. DeSesa and
Nietze1 3672368 found that 1 molar concentratione of phos-
phate, sulfate, or carbonate ion could be tolerated with

no 111 effect on uranlum extractlon. Small amounts of
sodlum phosphate have been used to suppress the extractlon
of thorlum wlthout affecting the extraction of uranium.128
Steele and Taverneri28 report the extractlon of appreclable
amounts of thorium and zirconium and small amounts of
vanadium, molybdenum, and platinum by ethyl acetate.
Grimaldl and Levine, 382 Guest and Zimmerman, 389 and Niletzel
and DeSesa31:368 have investigated the effect of a number
of elements on the recovery and/or determination of uranium
according to thelr respective procedures. Nletzel and
DeSesa307.368 found vanadium, present in 100 mg amounts, was
precipltated and uranium was occluded in the preclpltatate.
Titanium was observed to partially extract. This vas pre-
vented by preclipltation of titanium wlth p-hydroxyphenylarsonilec

acld before extraction.

coefficlents of ceslum, calelum, strontium, and lanthanum
when the uranyl nitrate concentration in the initial

aqueous solution 1s increased. This has been related to

the extraction of the elements as metal uranyl trinitrate
salts. The partition coefficient of uranium from a highly
palted aqueous solution is decreased by an increase 1n
uranium concentration. Kraus3l3 observed a, to decrease
from 153 to 78.3 as the inltlal uranium concentration was
Increased from 5 to 100 grams in an aqueous solution con-

The extractlon of uranium by hexone is facilitated by
the presence of substltuted ammonium nitrates whlch are
sufficiently soluble in the organic solvent. A number of
these salts and thelr effect on the extraction of uranium
are listed in Table xv. 18 Trli-n-butylamlne, 2-hexyl pyridine,
and dibenzoyl methane increase the extraction of fission
products.3L8 Maeck, et 21.302 have investigated the extrac-

a good separation of uranium from many lons. The separation

phate, acetate, oxalate, etc., in the amounts tested, exhibilt
no appreclable interference in the extraction of uranlum.

means. Some of hls results are given 1n Table XVI. The
effect of sulfate lon (experimental conditions B) 18 to
hinder the extraction of both thorium and uranium. The
effect, however, 1s greater for thorium than for uranium.
Consequently, greater separation of thorium and uranium

can be made 1n the presence of the complexing sulfate ion.

Other ketonle solvents

Hyde and Wo1£318 have studled the extractlon of uranium
and thorium by methyl n-amyl ketone and dlisopropyl ketone
as a function of total nitrate concentratlon in the aqueous
phase. In both cases, uranium was better extracted than
thorium. The extraction of thorium did not become appreclable
(¢5%) until the aqueous nitrate concentration was greater
than 5M. Dilsopropyl ketone was found to be an excellent
extractant of protactinium.3L8

Vesely, Beranova, and Ma1§382 have inveastlgated the
extraction of uranium and fission products by several
methylalkyl ketones: methylhexyl, methylamyl, methlbutyl,
and methylpropyl In addition to methyl lsobutyl and methyl-
cyclohexanone. The partltlon coefficlents of both uranium
and flssion product actlvlty ‘vere measured as a function of
acid concentration in the range of -0.4 to 3M nitric acid.
In thls acldlty range, fisslon product extraction was found
to be maximum in the 0-1M nitric acld region. The partition
coefficient, Opps in this reglon was greatest wlth methyl-
propyl ketone (22 x 1073 at 0.61M) and least with methyl-
hexyl ketone (2.4 x 1073 at 0.03M). In the acid-deflcilent
reglon, Opp Increased as the acld-deficlency was decreased
(the solution was made more acidlc). After the maximum
opp was reached 1n the 0-1M acid region, the partition
coefflelent was decreased and then increased as the aqueous

solution wes made more acldlic up to 3-4M. The partition

120
coefficient of uranium, os increased as the nltric acid
concentration was lncreased over the entire range. At 3M
nltric acid, a, varied from about 0.7 for methylhexyl
ketone to about 2 for methylpropyl ketone and 3 for methyl-
cyclohexanone. The greatest separation, Pp, of uranium
from fisslon products was found In the 0.1M acid defilclent
region (-0.1M). For methylhexyl ketone B was found to be
>1500; for methylpropyl ketone P was about 400. The extraction
coefficients of uranium were <¢ 0.2 for methylhexyl ketone
and about 0.5 for methylpropyl ketone at this acid concentration.
Allen383 has tested dlisobutyl ketone, diisopropyl
ketone, and methylhexyl ketone as solvents for the purifi-
cation of uranium from iron, copper, chromium, and nickel.
Dilsobutyl ketone was found most satisfactory under the
conditions tested. Dilsopropyl extracted some iron and
chromlum. Methylhexyl ketone extracted iron, chromlum,
and copper.
Uranium and thorlum may be extracted quantitatively
from a nitrate medium by mesityl oxide.38% Under the condl-
tions tested zirconium 1s extracted to a large extent;

vanadlum and yttrium to a lesser extent; cerium only slightly.

AT.COHOLS
Hyde and Wo1r3L8 found alcohols to be only falr ex-
tractants of uranium and the extraction capaclty to decrease
rapldly with the length of the carbon chaln. This 1s borne
out by the work of Poston, et 21.382 who measured the ex-
traction coefflcients of uranium and ruthenium as a function

of aluminum nltrate concentration of the aqueous phase for

* Experimental conditions: A salt of the elements tested was
dissolved in 10 ml of HNO3(15 + 85). Nineteen grams of alum-
inum nitrate crystals weré added and dissolved. The solution
was shaken for 15 seconds wlth 20 ml of mesltyl oxlde. The
extract was washed once with 20 ml of aluminum nitrate solutlon
and analyzed.

hexone and several tertiary alcohols: tertlary amyl alcohol,
2-methyl 2-pentanol, 2~-methyl 2-hexanol, 2-methyl 2-heptanol.
Only tertlary amyl alcohol extracted uranium better than
hexone (0:5 - 1.5M A1(NOg) 3, 0. 2MHNO,) and all four alcohols
extracted ruthenium better than hexone. Ruthenlum was
extracted as well or nearly as well ae uranium by the al-
cohols.

Dilsobutylearbinol extracts ruthenium nearly as well
as uranium. 388 Thorium and zlrconium-robium are poorly ex-
tracted. Protactinlium ia extracted much more efficlently

than uranium.

MISCELLANEOUS SOLVENTS

Nitromethane has been recommended by. Warners22 as an
extractant for uranium. It 1s resistant to oxidation,
stable to high concentrations of ritric :acid, and highly
selective. The dlstribution of uranyl nitrate between
nitromethane and water and nitromethane and saturated ammon-
ium nitrate solution 1s given ln figure 3-B. The extraction
of thorium nitrate by nitromethane from aqueous solution is
much less than that of uranium. Color tests indicate that
neither copper, cobalt, 1lron TI), nor chromium nitrate 1s
extracted by the solvent. With dlethyl ether, considerable
amounts of copper nitrate and trace amounts of ferric nitrate
are extracted. Nitric acld enhances the extraction of uranyl
nitrate by nitromethane. However, above a critical acid
concentration (~5N Initial acid concentration with equal
phase volumes at 20°C) only one liquid phase 1s formed.

ORGANOPHOSPHORUS COMPOUNDS. Within recent years, a
large number of organophosphorous compounds have been developed
and investigated as extractants for uranium. These compounds
have been eubdivided in the present paper into neutral and

acidic organophosphorus compounds.

122
NEUTRAL ORGANOPHOSPHORUS COMPOUNDS

Solvents included in this category are trialkylphosphates,
(RO)4P 0; dialkyl alkylphosphonates, (RO) RP - 0; alkyl
dialkylphosphlinates, (RO)R,P 0; and trialkylphosphlnhe oxides
RP = 0. The abllity of the solvents to extraét uranium is
in the order

(RO)gP = 0 < (RO,)RP— 0 < (RO)R,P— 0 <.RgP- 0.
This 18 also the order of increasing base strengths of the
phosphoryl oxygen .222 In Table XVII, the four types of
compounds are compared as extractants of uranium (VI),
plutonium (IV), thorium, fission products, and acids.387
It should be noted that although uranium is extracted almost
quantitatively by tributylphosphine oxide (Table XVII), other
elements are also hlghly extracted. In fact, in spite of
lower extraction coefflclents, tributyl phosphate affords a
better separation of uranium from thorium, plutonium (IV),
and fission products under the conditions listed in Table
XVII than does trihutylphosphine oxide.

Tables xvrrr388.389 and xx320 1llat the distribution co-
2fficients of uranium and some assoclated elements for a number
of neutral organophosphorus extractants. Silimllar information
on other solvents may be found 1n papers by Burger ,32% Healy
and Kennedy, 188 and in numerous ORNL reports. The latter have
been summarized by Blake, et 21.3% ana Brown, et s1309:392

The mechanism of extractlon by neutral organophosphorus
reagents appears to be simllar to that of tributyl phosphate . 2885

dilution of the solvent. Duncan and Holburt32L have measured
the distribution of uranium, initially present in 1.2 to 1200
micrograms per liter between 20% TBP in kerosene and nitric
acid solution. Although the results were somewhat erratle,

it was generally shown that the partition coefficlent 1s nearly

constant over this range of uranium concentrations.

132
The extractive cepaclty of TBP is affected considerably
by the cholce of diluent. Taube3? extracted u(vi), Np(IV),
Np(VIl), and Pu(VI) from SM HNO, aqueous solutlons with 0.15M
TBP dlssolved ln a number of solvents, including benzene and
chloroform. Larger extraction coefficlents were obtalned for
all the elements tested with benzene rather than chloroform
a8 dlluent. In the case of uranium, the difference in a, was
- greater than ten-fold. Little difference ln extractive
capaclty was observed wlth TBP diluted by benzene or carbon
tetrachloride. 8Simllar results were obtained by Dlzdar, et
21.329 Uranyl nitrate (0.0038M) was extracted from 2M nitric
acld solutions by various concentrations of TBP diluted wlth
carbon tetrachloride, xylene, kerosene, hexane, dlbutyl ether,
diethyl ether, and isopropyl ether. The partition coefflclent
was found to lnerease with increasing TBP concentration to a
maximum for pure TBP. For carbon tetrachlorlde and xylene
the maximum value was already attained at 40 mole per cent
TBP. The other dlluents are listed above ln the approximate
order 1n which they inhiblt the extractlon of uranium by TBP.
Differences in a, for various diluents, were found to become
smaller wlth increased uranium concentration. Bruce3LS has
found that the extraction of flssion products 1s also affected
by the choice of dlluent.

The extractlon of uranium by TBP is considerably en-
hanced by the presence of salting-out agents in the aqueous
phase 00-406 The results of Setot® are glven in Table XX
and figure 33.

The extraction of uranium by TBP decreases wlth increased

Phosphate, sulfate, and fluoride lons reduce the extrac-

Dialkylpyrophosphoric acids

Dlalkylpyrophosphoric acids are used in the recovery of
uranium from low-grade phosphate ores. Much of the work that
has been reported in project literature has been summarized
by Ellis, *23 by Long, Ellis, and Bailes, 28 ana by Brown and
Coleman.3%2 The acids are prepared just prlor to use by
gdding alcohol to a slurry of Py0g in kercsene wlth stirring
and cooling. A concentration of about 0.1 g P50 per ml of
Kerosene is optimum. +35 A 2:1 mole ratio of alcohol:P,0,
ls used to form the dialkylpyrophosphoric acid. A 3:1 mole
ratio should glve about equal mole quantities of mono- and
di-alkyl orthophosphorilc acids. 22 The reactions are com-
plex and mixtures of varlous phosphoric acids are formed.

Moat of the studles have been made wlth octylpyrophosphoric
acid (OPPA). Pyrophosphoric aclds deteriorate fairly rapidly
with time at room temperature. At elevated temperatures,

the rate of deterloration 1s even greater. Contact with
mineral acld causes pyrophosaphoric acids to hydrolyze to
orthophosphoric acids. The rate of hydrolysis ls slower

Uranium is stripped from the organic solvent by precipl-

‘Several papers have recently appeared ln open literature
publicatlons concerning the extraction of uranium by pyro-
phosphoric acids. ZangentoL has shown that OFFA prepared by
the aleoholysis of Po0g 18 a mixture of several components.
OPPA prepared in thls manner was found to be more effective in
the extraction of uranium than pure dioctylphosphorlc .acléd by
two orders of magnltude. The pure acld was prepared by syn-
thesis, starting from POC13.

In an effort to determine the uranium specles extracted
by OPPA, Grdenlc and Korpar+28 have isolated the species
U(0ct P04). The specles, however, was insoluble in ligroin,
the OPPA diluent. It was soluble in ligroin containing OPPA
in a ratio of one mole of U(IV)-salt and 2 moles of OPPA,
Thls indlcates U(Oct HP,0,),, is the extractable specles. The
same formule was obtalned by determination of the uranium
content 1n a saturated ligroin phase.

Habash1-t59 has Investigated the extraction of uranium
and other metals by OPPA from phosphoric acld solutions.

Uranium (VI) was found to be more highly extracted than uranium

168
(IV). Thig is surprising in view of the increased extraction
of uranium from reduced acld solution mentioned previously.
Also, cerium (III) was found to extract more readily than
cerium (IV). The partition coeffilclents of several metal lons

are glven for various phosphoric acld concentrations in Table

tration for all the metal lons tested except cerium. The
extraction coefflclents of both cerium (IV) and (III) pass
through maxima in the region of 4m H3POy. The partitlon
coefficient of uranium 1s decreased by lncreased initial
uranium concentration. The addition of NagPOy, to the solution
gauges a, tc increase greatly--apparently by decreasing the
hydrogen ion concentration ln the aqueous phase. Fluoride
lon Interferes most seriously with the extraction of uranium
by OPPA.

Zangen 20 has studied the extraction of uranium (IV)
from phosphoric acid by di{2-butyloctyl) pyrophosphate, BOPPA.

AMINES AND QUATERNARY AMMONIUM SALTS. A large number of
amlnes, quaternary ammonium salts, and other organonltrogen
compounds have been lnvestigated as possible extractants of

The factors that influence uranium extraction have been
studied most extensively for amine-sulfate systems .22% The
effect of amine structure on the extraction of uranium and
other metal lions is 1llustrated in Table xox. 30% Uranium
(IV) 1s efficiently extracted by primary amines. The effi-
clency decreases with secondary and tertiary amines. With
uranium (VI) there does not seem to be much correlation be-
tween a, and amine class. Wlth primary, sscondary, "and ter-
tliary laurylamlnes, Cy (vI)? under the condltlons gilven in
Table XXX, is < 0.1, 80, and 140, respectively.3ot With
primary laurylamlne an emulslon 1s formed. The extraction
of uranlum 1s also affected by carbon chaln branching near
the nitrogen atom in tertiary amines (Table XXX). Certain
n=benzyl-branched-alkyl secondary amines have been found to

extract uranium extremely well.3%% The uranium (VI) partition

coefficients of N-benzylheptadecylamine, N-benzyltetradecyl-
amine, N-benzyldodecylamine, and N-(2-naphthylmethyl) dodecyl-
amine, under the conditions outlined in Table XXX, are 2000,

of dlluent on Yu (VT) is 1ndlcated 1n Table xox. 30%

The partition coefficient,

amounts of uranium (60.4 mg U/ml initial aqueous concentration)

Moorel8 has also Investigated the extractlon of uranium
(VI) from acetic acid solution by T1OA. Extractlons were
carried out in the same manner as those from hydrochloric
acid solution (figure 53). Aqueous solutions of varying
acetic acid concentration containing 2 x 10% alpha counts
per mlnute per ml of p233 tracer were extracted with equal
volumes of 5% (w/v) TiOA in xylene. It was found that maxi-
mum uranium extraction (>90%) is obtained from 0.5M to 1M
acetic acid solutions. The addition of 3%(v/v) butyl cello-
solve to the Ti10A-xylene solution inhibits foaming during
the extraction process. By lncreasing the T10A concentration,
macro amounts of uranium are efflclently extracted. Greater
than 95% stripping may be achleved by contacting the amine-

Quaternary ammonium salts.

The enhanced extraction of uranium by hexone contalning
tetrabutylammonium nitratel or tetrapropylammonilum nitratesl2
has already been noted {see Hexone). Haeffner, Nllsson,and
Hultgrentld have also used tetrabutylammonlum nitrate to
extract uranyl nitrate with chloroform.

Quaternary ammonium salte, unlike amines, may be used to

extract uranium from alkallne carbonate solutions. tL. 478,480
The Rohin and Haas compound Quaternary B-104" converted to the
carbonate form has been used successfully to extract uranlum
from aqueous solutions having carbonate concentrations up to
one molar. X80 Amsco G alone or modifled wlth a long-ohaln

Clifford, et 51.251 report the extraction of uranium
from aqueous carbonate solutions by (1) forming a singly
charged anion, UO X3,with a complexing agent, and (2) ex-
tracting this anion into an organlc solvent with a singly
charged catlon. Extractions were obtained wlth benzoin 2-
oxlne, cupferron, hydroxylamine, peroxide, pyrogallol, and
8-quinolinol (oxine). The latter was used for further study.
Arquad 2C, B N(CH) ,C1, where R is about a 16-carbon chain,
was found to be the most effective extractant tested. Hexone
was found to be the most effective solvent tested. Kerosene
gave no extraction. With oxine as complexing agent, the
extracted specles was ldentified as Ry NUO, (0x) 5. The ex-
traction coefflclent of uranium was found to ilncreese with
Increased pH; to Increase with increased oxine concentration

and with increased RyNC1 concentration (to an optimum value);

to decrease with increased carbonate concentration. An ex-
traction coefflclent, xy of 10.9 was obtalned by extracting
two volumes of an aqueous solutlon containing 0.01K U0, (N03) 5,
0.92M Na,CO04, 0.04M NaOH, and 0.02M Arquad 2C with one volume
of hexone contalning 0.100M oxine. Both uranium and oxine were
removed from the organle phase by strong acids. Sodium bl-

The extraction of both uranium (VI) and (IV) from per-
chlorate solutions wlth acetylacetone as chelating agent has
been investigated by Rydberg. The percentage extracted 1s
glven as a function of equilibrium pH in figures 54%A,-B, and
-C for the three solvents, chloroform, benzene, and hexone,
respectively. The extractlon of other actinides, fisslon
products, and hafnium 1s also included in the figures. 12.21,
486-488 Strontium and potassium are poorly extracted by

acetylacetone into chloroform. 281 Lanthanum and samarium

are poorly extracted by the chelating agent into all three
solvents. tL

Krishent8d has 1lnvestigated the extraction of uranium
(VI) with acetylacetone used both as chelating agent and
solvent. The results are given in figure 554 together wlth
the extraction curves of several other metals. The effect
of masking agents, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, fluoride,
and tartrate, on the extraction of these metals is glven in

figures 55-B,-C and -D, respectively .t82

The extraction of uranlum by acetylacetone-chloroform
in the presence of sodium chloride and EDTA has been
studled by Tabushi . 120 Sodium chloride increases the ex-
traction yield and broadens the favorable pH range. EDTA
permits the separation of uranium from thorium and fission
products by more effectlve masking of the latter. Uranium
has also been extracted with acetylacetane using butylacetate

as solvent. tL

Dyrssen, et 21.28 have studied the extraction of uranium

and thorium from aqueous perchlorate solutions (pk = 0.1M)

by 0.1M l-nitroso-2-naphthol in chloroform. Fifty percent

of the uranium was extracted at pH 3.07 and fifty percent

of .the thorium at pH 1.66. Lanthanum and samarium were not

extracted. Other metals that have been extracted as nitroso-

naphtholates include Mn(II), Fe(II), Co, Ni, Cu(II), P4(II),

Ag, cd, Hg(Ir), Pu(1v)2:L and Np(v).228

Lhe, NH}.

Cupferron 1s an important reagent in the analytical
separation of uranium. The reagent precipitates uranium
(IV) from acidic (H,80, or HCl) solution but not uranium
(VI). By converting uranium to lta two oxidation states,
separatlon can be made alternatlvely from elements not pre-
cipitated by cupferron and from those preclpltated by the
reagent, The uranium (IV) cupferrate complex, U(Cup),
was found by Auger2i2 to be soluble in chloroform and neutral
organic solvents. Furman, et 21.220 found milligram amounts
of uranium (IV) to be incompletely extracted from agueous
acld solution by hydrogen cupferrate ln chloroform but to

be almost completely extracted by ethereal hydrogen cup-

197
ferrate; l.e., cupferron extracted by ether from an acid
solution. Ethereal hydrogen cupferrate was also found to
extract quantitatively macroamounts of uranium {IV) from
(1 + 19) sulfuric acid containing hydroxylamine hydrochloride
and submilligram amounts from (1 + 19) sulfuric acid in the
presence of saturated mercury-zinc amalgem.229 The partition
coefficient, %(Iv)’ 18 incressed wlth Increased cupferrate
concentration and 1s decreased wlth increased acid concen-
tration.222

A uranium (VI) cupferrate complex 1s precipitated by
the reagent from neutral solutions. There appear to be two
forms, one of which 1s soluble in ethyl ether,220 From
(1 + 9) sulfuric acid, milligram amounts of uranium (VI)
are extracted by an equal volume of chloroform with an ex-
cess of eupferron present .22°

The extraction of uranium (VI) cupferrate from aqueous.
perchlorate solution by hexone and chloroform is given in
figure 62 as a function of the pH of the final aqueous
solution.23 Chloroform 1s a poor solvent for the complex.
Hexone 1s better, but quantitative extraction 1s not achieved
by a single contact of the solvent with an equal volume of
the aqueous solution. The extraction curves for h,298 Sm,
and 12299 are also glven in the figure.

In the followlng paragraphs, the distribution of
uranium (and of other elements) between an ion exchange
resln and a particular solution 1s described in terms of
the distribution coefficlents, D and Dg. These are defined

as
D = amount MH /gram dry resin
amount M™*/m1 solution
and
p - amount MX/ml resin bed

V amount M'**/ml solution
The two coefflclents are related by the density of the
resin bed, D, = pD. The coefficlent D is referred to as

Ky. by many authora.

Anion exchange. Anion exchange resins commonly used
in the radlochemical laboratory are the strong base resins
such as Dowex-l and-2 and Amberlite IRA-410 and IRA-400.
The capaclty of these resins 1s approximately 2.5 milli-
equlvalents per gram of resin. Weak base resins are also

avallable. However, thelr use is more limited. These

resins have capacities ranging from about 6 to 10 mllli-
equivalents per gram of resin.

Splvey, et 21.23% have lnvestlgated varlous factors
such as resin capaclty, resin phase volume anion adsorption,
etc, that affect the sorption of uranium. Trivisonno232
has made a literature survey of factors that influence the
adsorption and elution of uranium by and from strong base
anion exchange resins. These are slmllar to the factors
influencing solvent extractlon and include, other than
those already mentloned, uranium concentration, anien con-
centration, pH, the presence of other metallic lons and
foreign anions, temperature, resin size, porosity, cross-
linkage, ete.

The varlous systems from which uranium may be adsorbed
by anlon exchange resins are described below. The resin
may be converted to a particular anionic form by washing
wlth an approprlate solution.

Chloride systems.

Kraus and Nelson232 have measured the distrlbution
coefficients for a number of elements between a strong base
anion exchange resin (Dowex-l, 10% DVB, ~200 mesh) and
hydrochlorle ac¢ld solutions of varying molarity. Thelr
results are shown in figure 65. The results of Marcus ,23L
obtained under conditions similar to those used by Kraus
and Nelson,238 are glven in flgure 66. The concentrations
of the varlous elements used in the study by Marcus were

was found. The data presented by Wish238 for the adsorption
of various elements by Dowex-2 ( x8,200-400 mesh) 1s repre-
sented 1n figure 67. Ward and Welch232 have studled the
distribution of neptunium ln varlous oxldation estates be-
tween Amberlite IRA-400 and hydrochloric acid solutions of
varying concentration. Thelr results show that Np(VI) 1s
strongly adsorbed at >6M HCl, Np(V) 1s exponentially
adsorbed from 3M to 6M HCl (D increases from 1 to 10), and
Np(IV) is similarly adsorbed from about 6M to 10M HCl (D
increases from about 2 to 400). Prevot, et 81.240 have
investigated the adsorption of U, Pu, Th, Fe, Ce, and Zr
" by anlon exchange resin A300D from hydrochlorlc acid solu-
tions ranging in molarity from 4 to 7. Quantities of 7 mg
Pu, 6.9 mg U and 5.9 mg Fe per ml of solution and 2 grams
of resin were used in the determination of D. Their results
are conslderably different than those shown in figures 65-67.
The distribution coefficlents of U(VI), and Fe(III) are lower
roughly by an order of magnitude. The distribution coefficient
of Pu(IV) 1s almost an order of magnitude higher. For Pu(III),
D 1s about 0.1 at 4M HCl and about 1 at TM HCl. Zirconlum
adsorption 1s similar to that shown In the flgures. Thorium
and cerium are poorly or not at all adsorbed.

Korkisch, et a1,241:542 have found the distribution
coefficlent of uranium between Dowex-] and hydrochloric acid

alcohol 1s about 40. Alcohol also increases the adsorption

of thorium, tltanlum, and zlrconlum. The distribution co-

Numerous separations of uranlum from other elements
are poselble using hydrochleric acid systems. The more ob-
vious ones are those in which uranium 1s adsorbed and the
other element is not. Consideration of figure 65, indicates
that uranium can be separated from alkali metals, alkaline
earths, aluminum, yttrium, rare earths, actinium, and thorium
by adsorption as uranium (VI) on a strong base anlon exe
change resin from a concentrated hydrochloric acid solution.
Trivalent actinide elements are not adsorbed from hydro-
chloric acid sclutions. Plutonium is eluted as Pu (III) with
12M HCl containing hydroxylamine hydrochloride and NH), I,
NH, I alone, or HI. Separatlons may be made by adsorption of
the contaminating element and elution of uranium with dilute
hydrochloric acid. For exsmple, molybdenum 1s adsorbed from
0.1M He1.243 Bismuth is also adsorbed from dilute (<1M)
ney. 24.545 Other elements that show strong adsorption from
dilute HCl include many of the transition metals, tin,
tellurlum, and polonium.238 Kraus and Moorea have effected
the separation of protactinlum and uranium by adsorbing them
from 8M HCl on a column of Dowex A-1 resin and developing
the column wlth 3.8M HCl. Protactinlum appeared first in
the eluent, separated from uranium. The uranium fraction
contalned; however, a falr amount of protactinium "talling'.

Advantage may be taken of the different distribution
coefficients exhlblted by ions 1n varlous oxidatlon states
to effect thelr separatlon from uranium. Iron reduced to
ferrous lon by hydrogen 10aideL or ascorbic acia28 1s
separated by elution with 4M HCl. U(IV) may be separated
from Pa(IV) and Th(IV). U(IV) 1s adsorbed by Amberlite
IRA-401 (100 mesh) and Dowex-1 (100-200 mesh) from >8M HCl.

209
Nelther Pa(IV) nor Th(IV) 1s adsorbed from 6M - 12.6M He1.249
The elution of Pu(III) by 12M HCl from strong base anion
exchange resln has already been mentloned. Wish and Rowe1122%
have effected the separation of Th, Pu, Zr, and Np from U
by elutlon with hydrochloric acld in a sequence of concen-
trations. The elements are adsorbed on the resin (Dowex-2)
from 12M HCl. . Thorium does not adsorb. Plutonlum 1s eluted
in the trivalent state wlth 12M HCl saturated with hydroxyl-
amine hydrochloride and ammonlum lodlde. Zirconium is eluted
wlth 7.5M HCl; neptunlum (IV) with a 6M HCl - 5% NH, OH * HC1
solution. Uranium is finally eluted with 0.1N HCl.

Korkisch, ot a1,22L have separated uranlum from tung-
sten by means of anion exchange. The uranium is adsorbed
on Dowex -1 resin from a solution containing 20% 4M HCY and
80% ethanol (volume #). Ascorbic acid 1s used to reduce
any lron present. The resin ls washed with a similar solu-
tion and uranium 1s eluted with an ether-saturated 0.1M HCl

solution. No tungsten 1s observed in the final eluate.

Fluoride systems.
Paris222 has reported the adsorptlon of elements from

hydrofluoric acid solutions with Dowex-1l anion exchange
resin (x10, 200 mesh). His results are shown in figure

68. Uranium (VI) adsorption is strong from dilute HF
solutions and decreases with lnoreased acld concentratlon.
Separation from elements exhiblting no or strong adsorption
from HF solutions may be achleved by proper selectlon of the
aold concentration. Elements such as Be, B, Se¢, Ti, Zr, Mo,
Sn, Te, Hf, Ta, W, Re, and Hg have adsorption curves similar
in shape to that of uranium (VI). Separation from these
elements using an HF system should prove difficult to almost
impossible, depending upon the distribution coefficlents in-

volved.

Certaln elements are efficlently separated from uranium

used. Such systems have been studied by a number of work-
ers.238.554-559 The results of Nelson, Rush, and Kraus228.
are shown 1n flgure 69. Farls and Brody222 have examined
the distribution coefflelent D of uranium as a function of
HCl concentration in the presence of 0, 1, and 8M HF and as.
a function of HF concentration in the presence of 0 and 0.2M
HCl. The former three curves are slmilar in shape but decrease

in megnltude as the HF concentration 1s increased. The pre-
gence of 0.2M HCl also causes a decrease 1n magnitude of
the D vs.[HF] curve. However, the shapes of the O and 0.2M
HCl ourves for varying HF concentration are disslimllar for
HF concentrations lees than 4M. ~

and Faris2%2 are glven in figure 70. From the non- or only
slight adsorption of most of the elements from nitric acid

Sulfate systems.

The recovery of uranium from sulfate liquors by anion
exchange methods 1s important lndustrially. Laboratory-wlse,
a number of procedures have been:developed for the determlnatlion
of uranlum that make use of the adsorbablllty of the anlonic
uranyl sulfate complexes. The nature of these complexes has also
recelved considerable study 28:566,567 (see section on complex iong)-
The dlstribution of uranium between anion exchange resins and
sulfate medla has been reported by a number of investigators .23%
543,550,557,561,568 mq results of Bunney, et a1.243 are given
in flgure 7l. Strontium, yttrium, cerium, and americlum do not
show any significant adsorption by the resin {Dowex-2) at any
acld concentration.243 The distribution coefficlent of Pu(IV)
is approximately twlce that of U(VI) in the acld range of 0
to 1ON H,80,,.222 The adsorption of uranium (and thorium) from
solutions of (NH), ) 50), 1s similar to that from H,80,. The
decrease in adsorption 1s lees rapld, however, with 1lncreased
ammonium sulfate concentration than with sulfurile ac1a.230.557,
568 The adeorptlon of uranium from sulfate solution exhibits
a pH dependence (D increases as the pH 1s lncreased from 1 to
4} which decreases as the sulfate concentration is decreased.23%
The distribution coefficlent of uranium between Dowex-1 resin
and O to 1.2N sulfurle acid solutions 1s one to three orders of
magnitude greater from 80% ethanol solutions than from aqueous
solutions.2XL

A number of procedures have been developed for the separa-
tion of uranlum from various elements by anlon exchange in
sulfate solutlon. These generally involve the adsorptlon of
the uranyl complex from a sulfate solution at pH 1 to 2 from
which the foreign element is not adsorbed. After thoroughly
washing the resln bed to remove impurities, uranium is eluted
with a dilute solution of hydrochloric, nltric, or perchloric

acid. Mixtures of elements that have been or may be separated

Carbonate systems.’

Uranium 18 recovered from carbonate leach llquors by anlon
exchange ln industrial operations. Its anlon exchange behavior
1s similar in carbonate solution to that in sulfate solution.
That is, the distribution coefflclent 1s decreased wlth lncreased
carbonate concentration. Thls ia illustrated in flgure 72 for
ammonium carbonate solutions.2[2 A plmllar decrease In D 1s
observed for increased sodium carbonate concentration.2%8 The
distribution coefficlent 1s also decreased by a decrease in pH
of the solution. The increase ln bicarbonate concentration at
the lower pH interferes with uranium adsorption. Other anions
such as sulfate; nitrate, and chlorlde may also lnterfere with
uranium adsorption from carbonate solution. To prevent gassing
with carbon dloxide, uranium 1s eluted with salt solutiors rather
than acids.

Vanadium and phosphate and molybdate2(2 have been separated
from uranium in carbonate solutions by anion exchange. The im-
purities are adsorbed on the resin together with uranium and
eluted with a 10% Na,CO4 solution. Uranium is eluted with a 5%
NaCl solution.

Phosphate systems.

The distribution of uranium and other elements between Dowex-
2 anion exchange resin and phosphoric acid solutions is represented
in figure 73.202 Marcus2: has studied the Dowex l-uranyl phosphate
system. His distribution coefficients are lower by factors of 2

to 50 at 0.1M HPO, and 3M HPO, respectively,2[2 than those shown
in figure 73.

Separations between uranium and the rare earths (ce3t,
ce*™), alkaline earths (Sr2*), alkali metals (Cs*), and tellurium

are possible using Dowex 2-H3PO, systems. The latter separation
has been used by w1sn280 who loaded a column of Dowex-2 resin
from a 0.1N HPO, solution. Tellurium passed through and
uranium was adsorbed. The column was then converted to the
chloride form With concentrated hydrochloric acid and uranium
was eluted with 0.1M HCl - 0.06M HF. An alternative method
involved loading the column from concentrated HC1. Tellurium
was eluted with 1.0N H3POy after washing the column with an
alcoholic phosphoric solution. The column was then washed with
an alcoholic HCl gas solution. Uranium was eluted with a 0.1M
HCl - 0.06M HF solution and molybdenum with 12M HNO,.
Miscellaneous systems.

Uranyl ion forms an anlonic complex with acetate lons at
pH %.25 to 5.25. The complex has been adsorbed on Amberlite
IRA-400 strong base resin in the determination of small amounts
of uranium 1n stones and natural waters, 2512582

Uranium 1s also adsorbed on Amberlite IRA-400 resin as an
ascorbate complex.283:58% Thorium, tltanium, zlrconlum, tungsten,
and molybdenum are also adsorbed.

Uranium complexed with sulfosallcylic acld has been
separated from Zn, Cu, Ni, and ca.285 The latter are complexed
with EDTA. The pH of the solution 1s kept between 8 and 10.
Separation has been made on Amberlite IRA-401 and Dowex-1 resins.

The uranyl cyanate complex formed by adding potassium
cyanate solution to a uranyl salt 1s adsorbed by Dowex=-1 anion
exchange resin.386 Uranium is eluted by a dilute hydrochloric

acld solution.

Cation exchange. Although a number of separations of
uranium from various elements have been reported ln the litera-
ture, the amount of quantitative data reported 1s rather meager.

Hardy28L has summarized much of the data avallable on the dis-

222
tribution of uranium between cation exchange resins and nitric
and hydrochloric acld solutions. His curves are reproduced in
figure Th. Distribution coefficient curves for other actinide
elements: Th, Pa, Np, Pu, are glven for comparison. Prevot,

et _a1.2%0 have published the distributlon curve for uranium
between cation exchange resin C.50 and nitric acid solution.
Its shape and magnltude are similar to that shown for the Zeokarb-
225-HNO4 gystem in figure T4. Ishimori and Okuno228 have found
that increasing amounts of methanol in nitrile acid solution
(0.18M) increase the distribution coefficient of uranium for
Dowex=50 resin.

The elutlon peak positions of a number of lons including
uranium (IV) and (VI) are given in figure 75 for varlous hydro-
chloric acid concentrations. The conditions under which the
peak posltlons were determined are described in the figure
captlon. Ionescu, et 1.988 have studled the effect of acetone
on the distribution of several elements between catlon exchange
resins, KU-2 and R-21, and dllute hydrochloric acid solutidns.
For fixed hydrochloric acid concentrations of 1, 2, and 3%,
maximum uranyl distribution coefficients were found between
60 and BO% acetone solutions. For U4 and 5% acid solutions, D
was found to be conslderably lower than for the more dilute
acld solutions.

Ishimorl and Okuno28 have investigated a number of cation
exchange systems other than those already noted. Some of thelr
results, D versus sodlum sulfate, sodium acetate, and oxallc .
acld concentration, are illustrated in figure 76. The adsorp-
tlon of uranium by Dowex-50 from solutions of hydroxylamine
was found to be pH dependent. Age the pH of the solution was
Increased, a sharp decrease ln D was observed between pH 5 and
6. Uranyl ion was not adsorbed by Dowex-50 resin from carbonate
solution.

hydrochloric, nitric, sulfurle, acetle, cltric, and perchloric
acids. Uranium (1.7 mg) adsorbed on a resin bed (1.4% x 14.5
cm) was eluted with 200 ml of various eluants. Uranium was
quantitatively recovered with 2-4M HCl, 2-4M HNO, and 1-2M
H,30,,. Uranium was incompletely recovered with 1M HCl, mM
HNO, 2M HC10,, 2M acetic acld, and 2-5% citric acld.
Sullivan, et 1.220 have investigated the distributlon of
uranium between Dowex-50 lon exchange resin and perchloric acld
medla as a functlon of time and bisulfate lon concentration.
Table XXXVI 11sts a number of separations of uranium from

various elements that have been achieved by cation exchange.

4, Chromatography- The subject of paper and cellulose chromatography
for the separatlon of uranium has been reviewed by Roddenid2 and

by Steele and Taverner .238 Work cf Soviet sclentlstas in the

fleld has been reviewed by Pale1:d0 and by Senyavin.222 References
to much of the literature may be found in the review article by

Kuznetsov, Savvin, and Mikhailov.220 Books by Pollarall3 and by

BlasiusSit include chromatographlc separations of uranium.

One of the most successful separations of uranium by filter-
paper chromatography makes use of the solvent, 2-methyltetrahydro-
furan. Of thirty-one metals tested, only ruthenium and rho-

106_ RHI, and tungsten (W185) were in-

dium, measured as Ru
completely separated from uranium (v233y, The results for tin
(snt13) and antimony (spl2H) were lnconclusive and the behavior
of mercury (203) was similar to that of uranium.

An example of the use of cellulose columns in combination
with organle solvent for the separation of urenlium is that given
by Burstall and Wells.226 An ethereal solution containing 5
per cent v/v of nitric acid is used to extract uranium from a
cellulose columh. The nitrates of the alkall metals, alkaline

Cerium in the III-state 1s not extracted. Thorlum extraction
is sensitive to the acld concentration. Zirconium extractlon is

first removed by volatlllzation as the lodide. Vanadium 1s re=-
talned 1f peroxides are absent. Ferrous sulfate reduces vana-
dium to an immoblle sglt. Phosphoric acld is extracted. Ferric
nitrate inhibits the extractlon of thls acid. The behavior of
molybdenum is complex. Iridium and rhodlum are not extracted.
Traces of ruthenium and platinum may be found in the eluent.
Palladlum 18 extracted. Reductlon of platinum and palladium
with FeS0, results in retention of bulk amounts by the column.
Small amounts of sulfate do not Interfere with the extraction of
uranlum. Sulfuric acld 1s retalned by the column under normal
conditions. Halldes increase the extraction of other elements,
e.g.,Au, Sn. Under normal conditions, HCl 1s retained in the
columm; HBr, HI, bromine and lodine move slowly down the column.
Molybdenum and arsenic may be adsorbed by the use of activated
alumina ln conjunction with cellulose.22L

The use of sllica gel columns combined wlth organic solvents,
dibutyl carbltol and tributyl phosphates and nitric acld have
been used for the separation of uranium and plutonium,818:619

A non-lonlc phosphorylated resin, dlethyl polystyrene-
methylenephosphonate, may be used to separate uranium (VI) from
iron (III), lanthanum, zirconium, nlobium, thorilium,and mixed
fission products.220 Uranium is adsorbed by the resin from 2

per cent solutions of dibutyl phosphoric acld. The other elements

230
are not absorbed. Uranium 1s eluted with a dimethyl formamlde=-
benzene solution.

The feasibllity of using tributyl phosphate gels for the
separation of uranium from iron (III) and thorium has recently

been demonstrated.22l

5. Volatllizatlon. Uranium may be separated from many elements by
fractional distillation of the volatlle compound, uranium hexa-
fluoride. This method of separation has been applied to the
recovery of uranlum from lrradiated fuel elements. Katz and
Rabinowitz: have reviewed many of the early methods for the pre-
paration of UFg: fluorinatlon of various uranium compounds with
elemental fluorine or cobalt trifluoride, disproportionation of
UF whlch results in both UF) and UF, and the reaction between
UF, and dry oxygen which results in UO, F, and UFg. The latter
two methods are not very practical from an analytical standpoint.
Other fluorlnating agents that form UFg Include ceric fluoride,
manganic fluoride, silver difluoride, halogen fluorides (e.g.,

BrF., and C1F;) and fused metalllec fluorides. Most elements

3
form fluorides under the condltions that UFg 1s obtalned. How-
ever, only a small number of these fluorides are volatile. Hyman,
et 21.3 have published a table of some 26 elements having fluorides
with boiling or sublimation points of 550°C or less. Included in
this group are the fluorides of boron, sllicon, phosphorus,
vanadium, sulfur, tungsten, blsmuth, plutonlum, and the fisslon
products, germanium, arsenlec; selenium, niobium, molybdenum,
ruthenium, antimony, tellurium, and lodine. The boiling point

of UF 1s 54.6°C.. Non-volatile fluorides from which uranium is
readlly separated include those of the alkali metals, alkaline
earths, rare earths, Fe, Co, Nl, Ag, Al, B¢, Mn, Tl, Pb, Zn, Cu,

Uranium hexachloride and uranium (IV) borohydride are
volatile compounds for which procedures mlght be developed for
the separation of uranium.

Uranium may be separated from arsenic, antimony, blsmuth,
selenium, and tin by volatilization of the latter elements with
a mixture of hydrobromlc acld and bromine. 138

6. Electrochemical methods. The electrolysis of dilute sulfuric acld
solutions with a mercury cathode results in the quantitative
deposition of Cr, Fe, Co, Nl, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, Mo, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd,
In, Sn, Re, Ir, Pt, Au, Hg, and Tl in the cathode.2%3 Arsenio,
selenium, tellurium, osmium, and lead are quantitatively separated
from the electrolyte, but are not quantitatively reposited 1n
the cathode. 213 Manganese, ruthenium, and antimony are incom-
pletely separated.2:3 Uranium and the remalnling actinlde elements,
rare earth elements, the alkali and alkaline eerth metals,
aluminum, vanadium, zirconium, nlobium, etc. remain in solu-
tion.223 casto923 and Rodden and Ware3% have reviewed the effects
of many variables in the electrolytic separation of the above=~
named elements from uranium. According to Rodden and Warf,3%
optimum conditions for the purification of uranium in sulfuric
acld solutions wlth a mercury cathode are: electrolyte volume,

50 ml; free sulfuric acld concentration, 1N; current density,
as high ae practicable with the given acid concentration (about
10 amp maximum); anode, flat platinum spiral or grid just

making contact wlth the surface of the electrolyte; cathode area,

232
a8 large as practicable; stirring, surface of the mercury cathode
is stirred rather rapldly; temperature of electrolyte, between
25° and 40°C; mercury for the cathode, pure; anions, chloride,
nitrate, and phosphate lons should be absent, or present in
only small amounts.

Uranium may be deposlted electrolytically at the cathode
of a cell from acetate, 024-631 carbonate, 832 oxalate, 933-638
formate, 232 phosphate ,240 fluoride ,232:641 and chloride242
solutions. * Many of the uranlum electrodepositlon procedures
have been developed in an effort to prepare thin, uniform films
for alpha and fission counting rather than to separate the ele-
ment from any particular impurity. However, in the work of
Smith and co-workergo2t, 626 and Coomans®2L urahlum was separated
from alkall and alkaline earth metals and zlnc. Casto®23 and
Rodden and Ware3t review much of the material pertinent to the

electrodeposition of uranium.
Electrodialysls has achieved a certain amount of importance
in the recovery of uranium from leach liquors. In a review ar-

tlcle by Kunin, 243 the following cells are presented for con-

sideration:

In acid systems (cells 1, 2, 3, and 4), the transport of sulfate,
nitrate, and chloride ions to the anode results 1ln a removal of
acid and a subsequent increase in pH in the cathode compartment.
The uranium, reduced during electrolysis, 1s precipitated as

Uo, or U(HPOY),- In the alkaline system, the transport of so-

2
dium lone 18 also accompanied by a rise in pH in the cathode
compartment and uranlum is again preclpltated as the dioxide or
as a mixture of dloxide and sodium polyuranate.

The electrodilalytic separation of uranium from metals in
a complex mixture has been demonstrated by Willard and Finley.S%%
An ammonium bicarbonate solution contalning U, Fe, Ni, Cu, Cr,
Zn, Al, Mo, Mg, and Na salts, and traces of other elements was
electrolyzed in a two-compartment cell having a cation permeable
membrane and a mercury cathode. The solution was firet made
the catholyte (electrolyte in the cathode compartment) and elec-
trolyzed. Iron (80%), nickel and copper (95%), tin, and zinc
were removed from solution by deposition. The blcarbonate solu-
tion was then made the anolyte and electrolyzed at a platinum
anode. All aluminum, molybdenum, ammonium, and silicon, and some
sodium and megnesium were separated from the uranium by migra-
tlon. Uranium was retained as the carbonate complex and was
recovered as the oxlde by evaporation of the anolyte.

Other features of the electrodlalytic behavior of uranium
that may be useful in its separation and purification are (1)

the retention of uranium during electrodialysis from a perchloric

234
catholyte using an anion selective membrane, (2) the dissolution

and separation of lmpure UF)» and (3) the feasibility of .electro-

dlalysis in organic solutions. 2%

Te Pyrometallurgical processes. Although pyrometallurgical or high
temperature processes have been designed primarily for large
scale recovery of fertile material from irradiated fuel elements,
some of the methods may find application In the radlochemistry
laboratory. Types of pyrometaliurgleal operations that have
received considerable attention are(l) distillation, (2.) salt

extraction, (3.) molten metal extraction, (4 ) oxidative slagging,

(5 )} electro-refining, and{6 ) decomposition of uranium iodide.

These methods have been reviewed by Lawroski 211

1. Plutonium 1s concentrated by vacuum dlstillation
from molten uranium at 1500-1800°C.

2. Plutonium ls extracted from molten uranlum by salts
such as UF, or MgCl,. Uranium remalns in the metallic
state. Pidtonium 18 recovered as a halide salt.

3. Plutonium 1s extracted by molten metals, such as
sllver or magnesium, that are immiscible with molten
uranium. Flsslon products are also extracted.

4, oxidative slagging involves the preferential formation
of the most stable oxldes by a molten irradlated fuel
element in a limlted oxygen environment. These oxides
(rare earths) float to the surface of the molten ma-
terlal and are skimmed off. Other oxides diffuse into
the erucible and through the slag layer.

5. In electro-refining, uranium is dissolved anodically
in a fused salt bath of alkall or alkaline earth halides
that contaln a uranium compound. Noble metals do not
dissolve and are deposited as anode sludge. Uranium
and chemically similar materlals are deposited at the
cathode. Alkall, alkaline earth, and rare earth fission
products concentrate in the salt bath..

6. Uranium 1s recovered as the metal from the thermal de-
composition of UI. Zirconium and nlobium are the principal
contamlnants.

" It is not the purpose of this section to describe the
technlques involved in pyrometallurglcal processes. The interested
reader may consult the many papers presented in "Progress in
Nuclear Energy, Series III, Process Chemistry,” volumes 1(1956)

and 2(1958), and in the "Proceedings of the International Con-

235

IV-E Determination of Urarilum

The amount of uranium ln a sample may be determined by
standard methods of analysis: gravimetric, volumetrie, colori-
metric, spectrophotometric, ete. 34a 191-195,197,198,200,645
‘Because of 1ts natural radioactivity, uranlum may also be deter=
mined by counting techniques. The appllcablility, in terms of
mass range, of various methods for the determination of uranium
1s glven in Table oovrI. A222
1. Counting techniques. Principles of alpha, beta, and gamma

counting are consldered ln revlew articles by Steinberg,

Hanna, S41 Deutsch and Kofold-Hansen, 248 Crouthame1, 242 and
Jarfey. 220 All three methods of counting are applicable to

the radiometric determination of uranium since both alpha- and
beta-emitting isotopes exist (Section III). Spontaneous fission
half=11ives have been determined for several uranium lsotopes:
v3, u?34, g235, 7236, 7238, These lsotopes are too long-lived,
however, to make fisslon counting a practical method for thelr
determination.

Ionization chambers are most commonly used for the detection
of alpha particles. In flgures 77 and 78 are shown the alphas
spectra of y235 and y233, respectively. The spectra were obtalned
with a parallel plate, Frisch grid lonlzation chamber using P-10
(90% argon, 10% methane) gas. A multi-channel analyzer was used
in conjunction with the ionization chamber. Both y235 and y233
samples were prepared by volatilization. Flgure 79 represents
the 233 alpha spectrum obtalned wlth a surface barrier sllicon
solid state detector. Data for this figure was taken from the
same sample as that for figure 78. It 1s readily apparent from
the two figures that the solid state detector glvea much better
resolution of the alpha groups than does the lonlzation chamber.

50 ug of 238 gives about 20 cpm at 52% geometry. Uranium-

238 may be detected in samples having much lower counting

rates than thls, depending upon the physical condition of

the sample and the presence of extraneous alpha activity. For
a thin source with low alpha Dackgpapnd, 1 alpha cpm of uranium
should be readily detected. For U this 1s the equlvalent

of about 2 pg; for other uranium lsotopes, the masa 1s even
less.

The data for figure 79, however, was taken in 1000 minutes. The
data for figure 78 was taken in 10 minutes.

Alpha particles may be counted also by gaseous, liquid,
plastic, and crystalline scintlllation detectors. The resolu-
tlon of these detectors ims, in general, less. than lonlzatlon
chambers and their application more limited. Nuclear emulsions
are used to record alpha activity. Such devices as cloud chambers
are generally not used in the radioehemlstry laboratory.

Gelger-Miller counters, proportional counters, and liquid,

plastic, and crystalline scintlllation detectors are sultable

".. for the counting of BT -emitting isotopes, pe3T, y239 and y240,

Sodium lodide-thallium activated cryatale have galned wlde-
spread acceptance as detectors of gamma radiation. The gamna-
ray spectra of y239, 237, y235, y233, and a uranium ore from
the Belglan Congo are illustrated in figures 80-84... The speotra
were measured by Crouthamel, Gatrousis, and Goslovichot2 with a
4_inch dlameter x 4-inch thick eylindrical NaI(Tl) crystal.

Not only can the amount of uranium in a sample be determined
directly by measuring the disintegration rates of the various
isotopes, 1t can also be measured indirectly by determining the
activity of daughter products. For such a measurement to be
meaningful, however, the equilibrium conditlon between the
uranium 1sotope and its daughter must be known.

Information on the radicactive decay of the uranium isotopes
1s glven ln Sectlon III. Further information on these isotopes
and their daughter products may be obtalned by consulting the
"Table of Isotopes" complled hy Stromminger, Hollander, and
Seaborg2l and the references given therein. Volumes 8 (1956),
3 (1958), and 28 (1958) of the "Proceedings of the International
Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomlc Energy" contaln a
number of articles on the radiometric determination of uranium.
Reference to many more articles 1s made in the review papers
by Meinke ,022
2. Sample preparatlon. One of the most important problems to
overcome ln the detection of alpha particles and in direct

fieslon counting 1s the preparation of thin folls or sample
| depoelte. This subject has recelved conslderable attention
and has been reviewed by several authors .232,647,650,653,654
Several techniques are available. The slmplest and most quanti-
tative 1s the direct evaporation of an aliquot of a sample. The
distribution of such deposits are generally not very uniform.
Thie may be improved upon by the addition of a spreading agent
such as tetraethyleneglycol, TEG. Palnting techniques may be
used to bulld up falrly uniform deposits of several milligrams

Samples of the metastable y235 1somer have been prepared
by electrostatically collecting the recoll atoms of Pu239 in
air. 951.658 A negative potential of several hundred volts was
applied to the metalllc collection plate.

Carswell and Milstea®d2 have succeeded in preparing thin
sources by a spraylng technique. The material to be deposited
1s dissolved as the nitrate in an organic solvent (alcohol or

acetone). The solution 1s drawn into a fine glass capillary

246
tube and sprayed onto the backing materilal by applylng an
electric field.

Electrodeposition 1s a generally satisfactory method for
preparing uniform samples wlth quantitative or nearly quantita-

tive ylelds. Uranium has been plated from a varlety of solu-
tlons: acetate, 34s 623,628-631 formate, 232 oxalate,o2 633-638

carbonate, 2 632 fluoride, 2 632,641 and chloride .S42 A satis-

factory electrolyte for the depopitlon of uranium is 0.4M
ammonium oxalate. 25% A rotating platinum anode 18 used to stir
the solutlon placed ln a vertical cylindrical cell. The cell

1s made of glass, luclte, or some other chemlcally inert material.
The cathode on whlch the uranium 1s to be depasited is thoroughly
cleansed and made the bottom of the cell. The assembled cell

1s placed 1ln a hot water bath and the temperature kept at about
80°C. A current denslty of approximately 0.1 amp/cm® 1s used.
The deposition 1s influenced strongly by the rate of stirring,
current density, and presence of foreign tons.25%

Vacuum sublimation provides an excellent means for the
preparation of thin depoeslts of uranium. The sublimation of
uranium acetylacetonate, U(CgH;0,) ys has been used. A more
convenlent method 1s the sublimation of uranium oxides. A
uranium salt solutlon ls placed on a tungsten or tantalum ribbon
supported between two electrodes. The solution 1s dried by a
heat lamp or by passing a low current through the metal ribbon.
The sample backing material 1s suspended at a sultable height
above the metal ribbon. A bell jar 1s placed over the assembled
unit and evacuated. The uranium ls volatilized by increasing
the current through the metal ribbon. The uniformity of the
deposit depends upon the distance between the ribbon and the
backing plate. The collection efficlency also depends upon
this dlstance but in an inverse manner to that of deposit uni=
formity. Usually a compromise ig made between collection

<°
efficiency and sample uniformity. Much of the uranium that is

247
not collected on the sample plate can be recovered from masking
plates and glass chimneys placed between the filament and backing
material. The collection effilclency may also be improved by
subliming from furnaces so that the beam of uranium molecules

1s directed toward the backing plate. . The furnace 1s heated

‘by electron bombardment or induction heating.

3. Activation Analysis. In activation analysis, a nucllde
irradiated by neutrons, gamma rays, or charged particles 1s
transformed Into a radloactlve nuclide more easily detected than
the original one. The amount of original materlal may be deter=
mined either absolutely or comparatively. For an absolute deter-
mination, the cross section of the reaction, the irradiation flux,
and the disintegration rate of the reaction product must be known
or determined. For comparative analysls, a substance of unknown
‘mass is irradiated simultaneously with a glmilar substance of
known mass. The positions of these two substances are elther
side by elde or, if separated, ln positions of like flux. The
reactlon product activities of the two samples are compared to
glve the relative masses of the startling materials. The com-
parative technique 1s, 1n general, much easler to apply. The
uncertalnties of many variables are eliminated by relative
measurements.

Activation with thermal neutrons may be successfully
employed as a method of analysis for--natural uranium, uranium-
236, and the fissionable isotopes of uranium. Natural uranium
consists of 1238(99.3%), u235(0.72%), and v23*(0.0057%) . £51 The

principal reactiorsof these nuclides with thermal neutrons are:

The amount of natural uranium present in a sample may then be
determined from the amount of y239, Np239 or pu=39 activity
formed after irradiation. Measurement of the Pu®S> activity,
however, requlres either a fairly large amount of 238, a long
irradiation period, or a comblnatlon of the two. The amount of
natural uranium may also be determined from the flsslon of
uranium-235 elther by (1) fission counting the sample, (2) iso-

140 or mel32%

lating and counting a flssion product such as Ba
or (3) measuring the total gamma activity induced in the sample
by a short neutron irradiation.2t5 Thermal neutron lrradiation

tion of netural uranium.

Other than e352, y233 is the best uranium isotope to determine
by fission counting or filssilon product analysls. Uranium-232
may possibly be determined in thie manner. The other lsotopes
are of such short half-l1fe that analysls of thelr own radla-

tlons 1s a much better means for thelr ldentifilcatlon.

Excitation functions have been determined for a number of
reactions with charged partlcles or gamma rsys incident on
uranlum lsotopes. These reactlons may be used for activation
analysls. For absolute analysis, it should be pointed out that
(1) the cross sections reported are sometimes subject to con-
slderable error; (2) energy determinations of the incoming
particle or ray are also subject to error; and (3) the reaction
product can often be produced by a number of reactions. Com-
parative analysls appears to be a much better method for the
determination of uranium. For gamma-ray (bremsstrahlung) activation,
slmultaneous irradiations in a like flux are falrly easy to
accomplish. The two samples; unknown and standard, are mechani-
cally rotated in the gamma-ray beam. For charged particle
activation, the simultaneous irradiation of twd samples in a
like flux may require some ingenuity on the part of the ex-
perimenter.

** Because of the short range of charged particles, irradiations
are generally made with targets attached to or within the

vacuum requirements, to coal the samples properly, and to
irradlate the samples simultaneously in a like flux may pre-
sent some Aiffiulity in equipment design.

IV-F. Dissolution of Uranium Samples

1. Metallle uranium.

HNO. Uranium metal dissolves in nitric acid to form uranyl
nitrate. With massive amounts of uranlum the rate of dissolu-
tion 1s moderately rapia.2lL The reaction between uranium
turnings, powder, or sintered metal and nitric acid vapors or
nitrogen dloxlde may occur with explosive violence .2lT Oxldes

of nltrogen are the principal gaseous products in the dlssolution

of the metal by HNO The presence of oxygen ln the dissolver

system tends to reduce the emlssion of these oxides. 88 The
rate of dissolution of large amounts of metallic uranium may

be increased by the addition of small amounts of sulfuric, 2
phosphoric, 212.680 or perchlor1ct8L acld to the nitrile acld.
H,80,. Hot concentrated sulfurle acid attacks uranium metal
slowly forming uranium (IV) sulfate lL Sulfuric acid-hydrogen

peroxide mixtures react slowly with the metal at 75°C forming

uranyl sulfate.282 The addltion of small amounts of chlorlde
or fluoride to H,S0), - H,0, mixtures increases the dissolution
rate .282

H3POy,. Cold 85% phosphoric acld attacks uranium metal slowly. oT
Concentration of the acld by heating produces a falrly rapld
reaction in which uranium (IV) phosphate 1s formed. If heated
too long, a chemically ilnert, glassy substance 1s formed.

HC10,,. Uranium metal 1s Inert toward cold, dilute perchloric acid.

 

As the concentration 1s increased by heating a point 1s reached
at which the reactlon proceeds with violence.2l12682 Oxldlzling
agents added to dilute perchloric acld dissolve the meta1.8L
HCl. Concentrated hydrochloric acld vigorously attacks uranium
metal. Dilution of the acld diminishes the attack. But even

with 4M HCl there 1s a rapid evolution of hydrogen 282 A

252
finely dlvided, black preclpitate soon forma after dissolution
begins. This preclpltate 1s not dissolved by heating. Only by
the addition of oxidizing agents (hydrogen peroxide, bromine,
chlorate, nltrate, persulfate, dichromate, or ferric ions) does
the precipitate dissolve. Gaseoup chlorine, aldéd by small
amounte of iror or iodine, also oxldlizes and solublllzes the
uranlum preclplitate. The addition of small amounts of fluosilicle
acl 682,68 or large smounts of phosphoric ac1a882 to the hydro-
chlorlc acid prevents formation of the black precipitate during
the dissolution of uranium metal.

HF. The reactlon of hydrofluoric acid with uranium metal ls slow
even at temperatures of 80°-go°c.8IL The reaction 1s inhibited
by the formation of insoluble UF), on the surface of the metal.
HBr. Hydrobromie acid attacks metallic uranium in manner

similar to, but slower than, hydrochloric acta. The black
precipitate is formed.

HI. The reaction between uranlum metal and hydriodic acid is
slow. LL

Organic aclds. Acetic, formic, proplonlc, and butyric aclds

2. Alloys of uranium. The ease with which uranium alloys are
dissolved depends largely upon the chemlcal behavior of the
alloying metal. Larsen282 has reviewed the dlssolution of

some of the more common uranium alloys. Table XXXVIII summarizes
the effect of various reagents on these alloys.

3. Compounds of uranium. Table II lists solvents for a number
of uranium compounds. General Review references 2, 4, 5, and

254
The dlssolution of uranlum oxides 1s of conslderable
interest since uranium samples prepared as accelerator targets,
for neutron lrradlatlons, or samplee found In the natural state
are frequently in the form of oxides. Also, many compounds of
uranium may be transformed to the oxlde by heating, hydrolysis,

or fusion. All of the oxldes, U0, Og, and Uo,, are soluble

in nitric acld, forming uranyl nltrate. U04 1s soluble in other
mineral acida. TU Og and Uo,

are dlessolved by fuming wlth

sulfurie acid. 3t The presence of fluoride accelerates this
d1ssolution.823 Alkaline peroxldes react wlth uranium oxldes

to form soluble peruranates 342087

4, Meteorites, minerals, and ores. The extraction of uranium
from natural deposits may be accomplished by decomposition and
dissolution of the entire sample lnecluding uranium or by leach-
ing the uranium from the sample. Grinding and roasting facilli-
tate the recovery. Roasting removes organic material. It also
helps form soluble uranlum compounds.

Decomposition of the sample may be accomplished by acld
attack, by fuslon,or by a comblnatlon of the two. Mineral acids,
individually or in comblnatlion, may be used. The presence of
hydrofluoric acld generally alds in dlssolution. Ores, sand,
ete. may be fused with sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide,
sodtum peroxide, sodlum bisulfate, sodium chloride and sodium
hydroxide, ammonium sulfate, potassium bifluoride, and mage
neslum oxide. Ls34,604 The melt 1s solubilized in water or acid
and the separation of uranium made by procedures outlined in
Section IV-D. Rodden and Ware3t have descrlbed a number of
procedures in which uranium was made soluble by acld attack or
by fusion methods. The recovery of uranium from monazite sands
has been reported by Calklns, et 21.59%

Acid and alkaline leaching ae used on an industrlal scale

" for the recovery of uranium frem its ores. In acld leaching,

255
hydrochloric, nitric, or sulfuric acld may be used. Indus~
trially, sulfuric acld is used because of its economy. Oxidizing
agents (Fe(III), MnO,, eta.) are used to convert uranium (IV) to
uranium (VI). A separation of uranium and thorium with an oxalic
acld~-nitric acld leach solution has been reported.S22

In alkaline leaching, various combinations of alkaline
carbonates, hydroxides, and peroxides have been used.: Indus-
trially, uranium is dissolved by alkaline carbonates as the
70, (C04) 3" complex. - Oxygen or other sultable oxidants are used:
to oonvert urenium (IV) to uranium (VI). Hydroxyl ions are
formed by the dissolution of uranium in carbonate solutions. The
presence of blcarbonate leon in the dissolving solution prevents
the precipitation of uranium. The recovery of uranium by acid
and alkaline leaching 1s reviewed in General Review reference
13 (Section I).
5. Blologlcal samples. The determination of uranium in blolo-
gical samples 18 reviewed by Steadman.298 Uranium may be ex=
tracted and determined directly from 1iquld samples. The sample
may also be ashed, as are solid samples, prior to urenium ex-
traction. Ashing nay be carried cut as a wet or dry process.
Wet-ashing 1s commonly done wlth a nitric acld solution. Ashlng
may be completed with perchloric acld. However, extreme caution
must be exerclsed when heating organic materials with perchlorlc
acld. The ashed residue 1s dissolved in aold and the uranium
determination continued from there. Wet-ashing need not be
‘carrled to completion. Analysis may be made upon the sample
after 1t has been thoroughly digested in acid.
6. Alr dust samples. Samples of air dust are commonly collected
on filter papers. The uranium may be dissolved by digesting
the sample in nitric acld solution or the sample may be ashed

and the residue dissolved in aoeild.

256
V. Collection of Detalled
Procedures

A procedure for the determination of uranium may entail
one or more purification steps as outlined in the preceding
sections. For example, uranium may be separated from impuriltiles
by a serles of solvent extractions with one or more different
solvents. These may be interspersed wlth precipitation and/or
lon exchange methods. The procedures described herein have
been gathered from projeet reports, the open literature, and
by private communication. Only a limlted number are presented.
They have been selected because they represent many of the
separation methode already described or because they represent
different problems in handling samples: problems of dissolution,
extraction in the presence of hlgh beta-gamma activity, etc.
A number of the procedures described do not make use of the ra-
diometric determination of uranlum. The method of separation
in these procedures, however, is applicable to radlochemlcal
“analysis and is, therefore; lncluded. A number of papers and
reports describe, in detall, procedures for the determination
of uranium. Thése should be noted. The work of Rodden and
wart has frequently been mentloned in this paper. In addl-
tion to procedures for the precipitatlon, solvent extraction,
volatilization, and electrodeposltion of uranium, these authors
have presented a number of selected procedures for the solution
of ores and minerals and the separation and determination of
uranium. Procedures for the analytical determination in naturally
occurring materials have algo been described by Rodden and
Tregonning, 38 Grimaldl, May, Fletcher, and T1tcomb,29 Sochoeller
and Powell, 293 and in the "Handbook of Chemical Determination

of Uranium in Minerals and ores. "898

The recent publication by
Mooret[L on extraction with amines contalns a collection of pro-

cedures, many of which have to do with the separation of uranium.

ROCEDURE 1: Uranlium-237.

Source: B. Warren, LA-1567 (1953) p. 18.

Editor's note: Uranium-237 may be separated from fission pro-
ducts, neptunlum, and plutonium more easlly by lon exchange and/or
solvent extraction techniques (see, for example, Procedure 7).

The following procedure 1s, however, an excellent example of
uranium purlfication by precipltation methods.

1. Introduction

The significant steps 1n the determination of u237 in ma-
terials contalning fission products, neptunium and plutonium are
the following. Rare-earth, neptunium, and plutonium activities
are removed by appropriate lanthanum fluoride scavenglng steps
in the presence of hydroxylamine hydrochloride. The latter
reagent serves to reduce both neptunium and plutonium so that
they may be carried down, and also to complex uranium and pre=-
vent 1lts later removal 1n lron scavenglng steps. Barlum and
zlrconlum are preolpltated by barlum fluozlirconate scavenglng.
followlng a cycle of ferric hydroxide scavenging and ammonium
dluranate preclpltation steps, uranium 1s reduced by zlnc metal
in hydrochloric acld medlum and precilpltated, presumably as
U(OH),, with ammonlum hydroxide. The uranium 1s further purifled
by alternate conversions to tetrafluoride and hydroxide. 24.14
23% (ux, ) which has grown in from 238 is removed by a zirconium
lodate scavenge and the uranium 1s converted to ammonium dluranate.
Uranium is finally plated from nitric acid medium onto a platinum
foll. “After flaming of the foll and welghling, uranium 1s beta
counted as Us0g- Chemical ylelds average 50 to 65%. Quadrupli-

cate determinations require approximately 8 hours.

PROCEDURE 2: Purification of Uranlum-240.

Egjtor's note: The followlng procedure was used bo BYELTY

u formed by the second order neutron capture of . The
principal decontaminating step 18 the ether extraction of
uranium from a reducing aqueous solution. Uranium 1s further

purified by a number of precipltations that are not described
in detall. These, however, are falrly easy to perform.

Irradlatlon and Chemlecal Procedure

Two grams of depleted uranium (1 part ge35 per 30,000 parts
238) as U30g in a small 2g aluminum capsule was 1rradiated in
the Hanford plle for 12 houre including time for startup and
shutdovm. S1x hours after the end of the irradiation the cap-
pule and its contents were dissolved in nltrlc acld, using
mercuric ion as catalyst for dlssolving the aluminum. The
uranlum was extracted batchwiee, the dlassolved aluminum serving
as a salting agent. The ether contalning the uranlum was then
passed through two static wash columns packed with 3/32 inch
stalnless steel helices and filled with a solution 10M in
ammonium nitrate, 0.1 M in nitric acld, 0.01 N in ferrous lon
and 0.1 M in urea. Neptunlum was reduced by the aluminum in
the dissolver and by the ferrous lon in the wash columnmg to an
unextractable oxldation state (Np IV and Np V). Additional
ether was passed through the columns to strip out the uranium.
These operations were carrled out by remote control behind
lead shielding. The Inltlal dissolver solution measured roughly
50 roentgens per hour at 8 inches. The ether solution emerging
from the second column and containing the uranium measured only
about 3 mr per hour at the surface, and most of thls was ether-
soluble iodine fission product activity. The uranium was ex-
tracted from the ether into an aqueous ammonium. sulfate solu-
tion and washed several times with ether to remove lodlne
actlvlity. LaFq was preclpltated from the uranyl nitrate solu-
tion after reduction with sulfur dloxide to remove any traces

of Np=32 which might have come through the ether extractlon.

265
PROCEDURE 2 (Continued)

»

The uranium was further purified by preolpltation as diuranate,
sodium uranyl acetate, and peroxide and by a final ether ex-
traotion. Throughout this final serles of puriflcatlons there
was no detectable decrease in p-activity; this indicates that
the uranium was radloactlvely pure.

Small aliquots of the final uranium solution were evaporated
on platinum discs and ignited to U30g to study changes 1n
activity. The remaining uranium solution was used for extraction

of neptunium daughter fractlons.

PROCEDURE 3: Purification of Irradiated U23°,

Source: S. Fried and H. Selig, Private communication.

Editor's note: The present procedure was used 1n an experiment
designed to measure the hs mal neutron fission cross section

of The amount of that can be tolerated 1n such an
experiment 1s very emall.

Two criteria were used in selectlng the purification steps

in the followlng procedure:

1) To obtaln uranium free of fission products and other
extraneous activitles wlthout Introducing contamlnant
normal uranium ln the procedure.

2) The initial part should lend itself easlly to remote

control manipulation.

"The reagenta used were carefully purified. Thus, the niltrie
acld and perchloric acid were redistilled in a2 quartz still.

The NH, NO was prepared from gaseous ammonia and distilled HNO.
The HCl was prepared by passing HCl gas into triply distilled

H,0, ete.

266
PROCEDURE 3 (Continued)

Procedure:
A. In Cave
The irradiated uranium oxide (~0.3 mg) was dissolved in
concentrated HNO, and made up to 2 M in HNO; with distilled H,0
to glve total volume of about 15 ml. Some Fett was added to
keep Pu and Np in +4 state. The solutlon was saturated with
NH) NO and contacted four times with 10 ml portions of ether.
Each contact was scrubbed twice with 2 M HNO saturated with
NH) NO3. The comblned ether extracts were back extracted three
times wlth 5 ml portions of H,0. The 'H,;0 strip was evaporated to
dryness and treated wlth HCl to destroy NH) NO, carried over.
B. Outside Cave

The sample could now be handled easlly outelde the cave
with a minimum ‘of shielding, most of the activity being due to
v237, A mass spectrometrlc analysls showed 1t contalned 0.5
welght % of U23!. A fission count showed that additional puri-
238

ficatlon was necessary to remove Np formed by (n,y) on Np2 37
which had bullt up during lrradlatlon.

The sample was taken up ln about 0.5 ml 6 N HCl and put
on a small Dowex-1l column and washed. The Np comeg off 1n
6 N HCl. Finally the uranium was eluted with 0.5 M HCl. The
eluate was evaporated to dryness and taken up ln 0.2 ml of 5 M
HCl, O.1 M KI and 0.05 M NH, OH o 2HCl. This was heated at 90°
for 2 minutes, diluted to 0.5 M in HCl and TTA extracted twice
for 15 minutes. The original fraction was washed twice with
benzene and evaporated to dryness.

In order to clean up the uranium for a mass apectrometric
analysis, 1t was subjected to another ether extraction as in
the first step. After the NH, NO was destroyed the sample was
fumed with HC10,, to destroy any organic resldue from the ether

extraction.

Plutonium Calculatlon:

To determine the amount of Pu in the origlnal sample, it
is necessary to measure ln a Frlsch chamber the alpha spectrum
of the plate prepared in Step 8. The ratio of Pu-239 and Pu-240
activity to Pu-236 activity is calculated. If the ratio is mul-
tiplied by the original activity of Pu-236 added, the original
activity of Pu-239 plus Pu-240 can be obtained. From the mass
analysis a Pu-239 to Pu-240 atom retio is obtained. The speci-
fic activity of the mixture ls calculated from that of the lndl-
vidual isotopes. The Pu-239 plus Pu-240 activity can be con-
verted to Pu=239 plus Pu-2U40 weight by dividing this activity
by the speclfilic activity of the mixture.

Uranium Calculation:

The ratio of the various U lsotopes to U-233 from the mass
spectrometer data 1s multiplled by the amount of U-233 splke
originally added to the sample to obtaln the amount of each

uranlum isotope present ln the orlglnal sample.

PROCEDURE 5 (Continued)

titatlvely separated from large quantities of diverse ions by
extraction into methyl lsobutyl ketone (4-methyl-2-pentanone)

from an acld-deficient aluminum nitrate salting solution. Milll-
gram levels are determined by a direct absorbance measurement

of the trinitrate complex ln the separated organic phase at

452 mp. Mlerogram amounts are determined by adding dibenzoyl-
methane (1,3-diphenyl-l,3-propanedione) in an ethyl alcohol-
pyridine mixture to the separated organic phase and measuring

the absorbance of the chelate at 415 mu. The coefficlent of
variation 18 less than 1% at the 10-mg. and 25-y levels. The
limit of sensitivity 1s 0.8 vy for the dlbenzoylmethane method.

Apparatus and Reagents

Absorbance measurements of the tetrapropylammonlum uranyl
trinitrate complex were made with a Cary Model 14 recording
gpectrophotometer and l-cm. Corex cells. A Teflon 9 x 9 x 6 mm.
spacer placed 1n the bottom of the cells permits absorbance
measurements with 2 ml. of sample. Abaorbance measurements of
‘the dlbenzoylmethane complex were made wlth a Beckman DU spec=
trophotometer and 5-cm. Corex cells.

Extractions were made ln 125 x 15 mm. test tubes with
polyethylene stoppers. A mechanical extraction device? was
used for agitation.

layer by means of water, colorimetric determination of the uranium
is carried out by the sodlum hydroxlde-hydrogen peroxide method.
The procedure 1s accurate, rapld, and easlly adeptable to routine

work.

Reagents and Apparatus

Reagents. Ethyl acetate (Merck, reagent grade).

ALUMINUM NITRATE SALTING SOLUTION. Place approximately 450
grams of reagent grade (Mallinckrodt) aluminum-nitrate [A1(NOg) 5
9H,,0] in a 600-ml. beaker and add 25 to 50 ml. of distilled water.
Cover the beaker and heat the mlxture on a hot plate. If a clear
solution does not result after 5 to 10 minutes of bolling, add 20
ml. of water, and continue the bolling for 5 more minutes. Repeat
this step untll a clear solution 1s obtalned after bolling. Remove
the cover glass and concentrate the solutlon by bolling untll a
boiling point of 130°C. 1s reached. Cover the beaker with a watch
glass and either transfer the solution to a constant temperature
apparatus or keep the solution warm, finally heating to just under
bolling before use. If the solutlon 1s allowed to cool to approxi-
mately 60°C., recrystallization of aluminum nitrate wlll take place.
It is necessary, therefore, to dllute the salting agent solution by
about one third ln order to prevent recrystallization 1f the solu-
tion cools to room temperature. Accordlngly, 1f the solution 1s to
stand overnight, add 35 ml. of dilstllled water per 100 ml. of salt-
ing agent solution, mlx well, and cover.

If the salting agent solutlon 1s. to be stored, the following
procedure has been found convenlent. Adjust the solution to the
proper concentration (boiling point, 130°C.) and transfer to a 100-
ml. three-necked reaction flask set on a heating mantle. AdJust the

insoluble residue Into an appropriate volumetric flask and make
up to volume. Regulate the dllutlion so that the aliquot chosen
for extraction wlll contaln between 10 and 30 mg. of uranium
oxide if the final dllutlon for the colorimetric finish is to
be 250 ml. AdJust the acldlty of the sample solutlon to about
5% in nitric acid.

If nitric acld treatment 1s not sufficient, treat the
Sample wlth hydrochloric acld, nitrlc acid, perchloric acld,
and finally sulfuric acid. If necessary, add a few milliliters

of hydrofluoric acld. Fume the sample to dryness and leach
the resldue with nltrle acid, flnally transferring the solution
and resldue to an appropriate volumetric flask and adjusting
to 5% in nitric acld as ln the elngle acld treatment.

If the sample is refractory, use the sugar carbon-sodium
peroxide fusion method described by Muehlberg. After dissolu-
tion of the sample in this manner, transfer the acidifled solu-

tion to an approprlate volumetric flask and dilute so that the
final solution 1s 5% in nitric acid.

Allquot solution samples directly or dllute as required for
an ekbhyl acetate extraction. If the sample 1s aliquoted at-
rectly for an extraction, add 5 drops of concentrated nitric asecid
per 5-ml allquot of sample and standards before extraction. Where
samples are diluted before aliquots are taken for extraction,
adjust the acidity so that the final volume ls 5% in nitric acid.

Ethyl Acetate Extraction. Place an appropriate aliquot

 

(usually 5 ml.) in a 60-ml. separatory funnel, the stopcock of
which has been lubrlcated wlth silicone grease. Add, by means
of a graduated plpet, 6.5 ml. of aluminum nitrate solution per
5 ml. of sample solution. The aluminum nitrate saltlng solu-
tion should be added while hot (above 110°C.). Cool the solu-
tlon to room temperature and add 20 ml. of ethyl acetate.
Stopper the separatory funnels wlth pretreated rubber stoppers.
Shake the mixture for 45 to 60 seconds. Occaslonally crystalli-
‘zation wlll take place In the separatory funnel near the stop-
cock. In such a case place the lower part of the separatory
funnel 1n a beaker of hot water untll the solidlfled portion
dissolves.

After the layers have separated, drain off the aqueous
(lower) layer. Occaslonally a cloudiness wlll appear at the
boundary of the aqueous and organlc layer. Thls cloudy portion
should not be dralned off. Add 10 ml. of slumlnum nltrate wash

Rinse inside the stem of the separatory funnel with a stream of
water from a wash bottle.

Water Stripping of Uranium from Ethyl Acetate Layer Followed
by Sodium Hydroxlde-Hydrogen Peroxlde Colorimetric Flnish. Add
15-ml. of water to the separatory funnel contalning the ethyl
acetate, stopper the flask, and shake the mixture for about
1 minute. After washing off the stopper with water, drain the
aqueous layer into a volumetric flask of suitable slze and wash
the separatory funnel and ethyl acetate layer 4 or 5 times with
5=-ml. portlons of water by means of a wash bottle. Combine the
aqueous fractions.

Add enough 20% sodium hydroxide solution (w./v.) to neu-
tralize the solution and dlssolve any precilpltated aluminum
hydroxide, then add 10 ml. in excess per 100 ml. of final
volume. Add 1 ml. of 30% hydrogen peroxide per 100 ml. of final
volume and make up the volume to the mark wlth distilled water.
Read the shsorbance after 20 minutes on the Beckman DU spectro=
photometer at 370 mp against a reagent blank, using l-cm. Corex
cells and a sllt wldth of 0.2 mm. Compare the absorbances of
the samples against the absorbances of standard uranium solu-
tlons which have been carrled through the procedure at the same
time. Choose the standards so that they cover the range into
whlch the samples are expected to fall, using a ratlo of one
standard to six samples. In practice lt 18 customary to work
between the limits of 10 and 30 mg. of uranium oxide. This 1s
arranged by estlmatlng the requlred sample weights and diluting
and sampling accordingly. The final volume for colorimetric
reading is usually 250 ml.

PROCEDURE 6 (Continued)

Double Extraction of Uranlum wlth Ethyl Acetate Followed
by Applicatlon of Differentlal Colorimetry. Uranium determina-
tions requiring the highest accuracy may be carried out by a
double extraction of uranium with ethyl acetate follawed by the
application of differentlal colorimetry as desoribed by Hiskey
and others.2=L In such a case 1t 1s recommended that between
100 and 150 mg. of uranium oxlde be extracted, and a wave length
of 400 mp be used during the colorimetric finish. The procedure
described below has been found satisfactory.

Extract an approprlate aliquot of the sample solution with
20 ml. of ethyl acetate as described above. Draw off the a-
queous layer into a second separatory funnel containing 10 ml.
of ethyl acetate. Stopper the funnels and shake the mixture for
45 to 60 seconds. Draln off and discard the aqueous layer. Add
10 ml. of aluminum nitrate wash solution to the first ethyl ace=-
tate extract, stopper, and shake the mixture for 45 to 60 seconds.
Drain off the aqueous layer Into the separatory funnel containing
the second ethyl acetate extract, stopper, and shake the mixture
" for U5 to 60 seconds. Drain off and discard the aqueous layer.
Combine the ethyl acetate fractions. Rinse the second separe-
tory funnel with 20 ml. of water, draining the washings into the
separatory funnel containing the combined ethyl acetate frac-
tions. Sheke the mixture for 1 minute. Continue the water
stripplng as descrlbed above, collecting the fractions in an
appropriate volumetric flask. Finish colorimetrically as de-
scribed previously, allowing the strongly colored solution to
stand 1 to 2 hours to ensure stabllity before readlng as a fading

through the extractlon and color development procedure in the
same manner as the gample. Also carry along other standards
containing slightly higher and lower amounts of uranium than
the sample. Determine the concentratlon of uranium in the
sample elther by the calilbration-curve method or the correction
method, as described by Neal?. If the amount of uranium in the
sample 1s not known, make a test run by taking an aliquot of the
sample solution and assaylng for uranium by the more rapid sin=-

then be chosen according to the result obtalned.

Removal of Interfering Thorium. After an ethyl acetate ex-
traction, strip the uranium in water from the ethyl acetate and
collect the uranium fraction ln a 250-ml. beaker. Add sesnough
20% (w./v.) sodium hydroxide solution to neutralize the solution
and redissolve precipitated aluminum hydroxide. Then add 10-
ml. excess of 20% sodlum hydroxide solution and 1 ml. of 30%
hydrogen peroxide per 100 ml. of final volume. Filter the solu=-
tion through an 1l-cm. 41H filter paper (Whatman), collecting
the filtrate in a volumetrlc flask of sultable slze. Wash the
paper and precipltate once with 5 ml. of a solution of 2% sodium
hydroxide containing 0.l ml. of 30% hydrogen peroxide. Re-
dlssolve the preclpltate by washing the paper with 10 ml. of
10% nitric acld solution, collecting the washings in the original
beaker. Neutralize the solutlon with 20% sodium hydroxide
solution, and add 2 ml. in excess. Add 0.5 ml. of 30% hydro-
gen peroxlde, and filter off the precipitate on the original
filter paper, washing as before and collecting the flltrates

1. Introduction

In the carrler-free method for the determination of y237,
the principal decontamination step (which 1s preceded by a
La(OH) 4 scavenge and partial removal of plutonium as the cup-
ferron complex) 1s the extraction of uranium into 30% TBP
(tertiary butyl phosphate) in benzene. Additional decontam-
ination 1s effected by adsorption of uranium, first on an anion
and then on a catlon exchange resin. The uranlum 1s finally
electroplated on platinum. The chemical yleld is 40 to 60%
and 18 determined through the use of y233 tracer. The g237
1s B-counted 1n a proportional counter with a 2.61-mg/cn Al
absorber, and from the number of counts the number of atoms
of the 1lsotope is calculated. Four samples can be run in

about 6 hours.

Source: E. L. Gelger, Health Physics 1, 405 (1959).
Abstract

A method ls discussed for the separation of uranium
and plutonium from vegetatlon, soll and water. The method
is based on the extraction of uranium and plutonium from 4
to 6 N nitric acid into 50% tri-n-butyl phosphate in n-tetra-
decane diluent. Uranlum and plutonlum are recovered together
with sufficient reduction ln total sollds to allow a-counting
and pulse helght analysis. Data from several hundred "splked"
samples to which uranlum and plutonium were added lndicate a
nearly equal recovery of uranlum and plutonium. Average re-
coveries are 76 + 14 per cent for vegetation, 76 = 16 per
cent for soll, and 82 = 15 per cent for water. The procedure

1s designed for samples that may be collected and analyzed

Procedures
Preparation of samples

Vegetation. Cut oven-dried vegetation into small pieces
and welgh 10.0 .g into a 150 ml beaker. Heat the sample at
600°C, starting with a cold muffle furnace. When only white
ash remalns, remove the beaker from the muffle furnace and
allow to cool. Carefully add 2 ml of water, then add 10 ml
of 8 XN HNO5=0.5 M A1(NOg)4 solution. Cover the beaker with
a watch glass and boll the solutlon for 5 mln. Allow to cool,
add 1 ml of 2 M KNO, solution and transfer the sample to a
100 ml centrifuge tube. Use 4 N HNOg to complete the transfer.
Centrifuge and decant the supernate into a 125 ml cylindrical
separatory funnel graduated at 30 ml. Wash the residue with
4 N HNO, centrifuge, and decant the wash solution to the
separatory funnel. The acid normality of the combined solu-
tions at this point 1s 4-6 N and the total volume should not
exceed 29 ml. Proceed to the extractlon procedure.

Soll. Grind 5 g of oven-dried soll with a mortar and
peatle untll the entlre sample can pass through a 200-mesh
sleve. Weigh 1.0 g of the 200-mesh soll into a 50 ml platinum
cruclble and heat the sample at 600°C for 4 hr. Remove the
sample from the muffle furnace and allow to cool. Add 3 ml of
70% HNO and 10 ml of 48% HF then stir the sample for 2-3
mln with a platinum rod. Heat the sample in a 200°C sand
bath until all tracee of moisture are removed. Repeat thls
HNO, -HF treatment being careful that the sample 1s completely
dry before proceeding to the next step. Allow the sample to
cool and then add 15 ml of 6 N HNO3-0.25 M A1(NO5),4 solution.

Cover with a watch glass and heat ln the sand bath for 5 min.

288
PROCEDURE 8 (Continued)

Allow to cool and decant the solution through a filter, such
as Whatman no. 40, into a 125 ml oylindrical separatory funnel
graduated at 30 ml. Leave as much of the resldue as possible
in the crucible and repeat the hot 6 N HNO4-0.25 M A1(NOg),
treatment. Allow to cool and then fllter. Proceed to the ex-
traction procedure.

Water. Place 1 1. of the sample in 2 1.5 1. beaker and if
basle, neutralize with nitric acid. Add 15 ml of 70% HNO and
evaporate to 30-40 ml. Decant the solution through a filter,
such as Whatman no. 40, into a 100 ml beaker. Wash the 1.5 1.
beaker, the residue and the filter with 4 XN HNO. Evaporate the
combined solution in the 100 ml beaker to 5 ml. Add 20 ml of 4 N
HNO4, cover with a watch glass, and heat for 5 min. Transfer the
sample to a 125 ml cylindrical separatory funnel graduated at 30
ml. Wash the beaker with 4 N HNOg and transfer to the separatory
funnel, belng careful that the total volume in the separatory

funnel does not exceed 29 ml. Proceed to the extractlon procedure.

Extraction

Add 1.ml of 2 M KNO, to the sample in the 125 ml cylindrical
separatory funnel. Dilute to the 30 ml mark with 4 N HNO and
stir the solution briefly. Add 30 ml of 50# TBP in n-tetradecane.
Agltate the solution vigorously for 4 min with an air-driven
stirrer. Discard the acid portion (lower layer). Wash the TBP
portion with 4 N HNO, and agaln discard the acid portion. Back

Tri-n-octylphosphine Oxide.
Source: C. A. Horton and J. C. White, Anal. Chem. 30, 1779 (1958).

Abstract

A simple, rapld method for the determination of uranium in
impure aqueous solutions was developed. Uranium(VI) 1s extracted
by 0.1M trl-n-octylphosphine oxlde ln cyclohexane from a nitric
acid solution. A yellow color ls formed in an aliquot of the or-
ganlc extract by additlon of dlbenzoylmethane and pyridine in ethyl
alcohol. Interference by catlons 1s minimized or eliminated by
selective reduction, by fluoride complexatlon, or by absorbance
measurement at 416 mp rather than 405 mu, the wave length of
maxlmum absorbance, Interference by excess fluorlde or phosphate
1s eliminated by addition of aluminum nitrate before extraction.
The range of the method 1s 20 to 3000 ¥ of uranium ln the origlnal
solution, and the standard deviation is 2%.

Apparatus and Reagents

Absorbance measurements were made with a Beckman DU spectro-
photometer, using 1.00-cm. Corex or slllica cells.

Phase equillbratlion for most extractions was carrled out in
the bottom portion of the apparatus (see accompanying figure).
Phase separation and removal of allquots of the upper organic
phase occurred after inverting the apparatus so that the solution
was In the portlon of thls apparatus shown on top ln the filgure.

Some extractions were carrled out in 60- or 125-m]. separatory funnels.
STANDARD URANIUM SOLUTIONS. A stock solutlon of 24.0 mg. of

uranium(VI) per ml. was prepared by heating 7.10 gram of uranium
(IV-vI) oxide (030g), prepared from pure uranium(VI) oxide (ug),
in 10 ml. of perchloric acld to dlssolve 1t, and then dlluting
the resultant solution to 250 ml. with water. Dilutions of this
solution were made as required. Another standard solution in 5%
sulfuric acld was also used in checking the spectrophotometric

callbration curve.

for use as the chromogenlc agent.

PYRIDINE. Por most of the work, a solution prepared by
mixing 1 volume of redlatllled reagent grade pyridine and 1 volume
of 95% ethyl alcohol was used.

TRI-n-OCTYLPHOSPHINE OXIDE. A 0.10M solution of this material,

Preliminary Treatment .A. Samples which do not contain inter-

fering lons. Pipet a 0.5- to 8-ml. aliquot of a solution in nitric,
perchloric, or sulfurlc acld, estimated to contaln 15 to 2500 y

of uranium(VI), into the bottom portion of the extraction vessel.
By the addition of strong 10M sodlum hydroxide, nitric acid, or
sodium nitrate, adjust the solutlon so that a total aqueous volume
of 10 ml. will be 1 to 3N in hydrogen lon and 2 to 4M in nitrate
ion. For almost neutral solutions, 2 ml. of concentrated nitric
acid wlll give the correct concentrations for a 10-ml. aqueous:
volume. Adjust the total volume to 10 ml, Up to 12 ml. of aqueous
solution can be shaken with 5 or 10 ml. of extractant in the ap-
paratus wlthout undue splashing. If the total aqueous volume 1s
greater than 12 ml. after adjusting the acldlty and nitrate con-
"tent, perform the extractlon 1n a separatory funnel instead of the

12 ml. wlll be 1 to 3N in hydrogen lon and 2 to 4M in nltrate ion.

C. Samples containing titanlum, thorium, hafnium, zirconium,
or iron(III), but only traces of aluminum. Plpet a 0.5- to 6-ml.
aliquot of a solutlon 1n dllute nitrile, perchloric, or sulfurlo
acld, estimated to contain 15 to 2500 vy of uranium, into the
bottom of an extractlon vessel. Add sufficient base or acid, nltrate,
end water to give a volume of about 8 ml., such that the solution
is 1 to 3N in hydrogen ion and 2 to 4M in nitrate lons. Add up to
a maximum of 2.5 ml. of 1M potasslum fluoride when the concentra-
tions of interfering lons are unknown. If high concentrations of
these lone are known to be present, addlitlonal fluoride can be
tolerated.

D. Samples contalning excessive fluoride or phosphate.

Pipet an allquot into an extractlon vessel, and adjust the acid

Abstract
A radiochemical method for the determination of uranium-237
is based on complexing the uranyl lon in alkaline solution with
hydroxylamine hydrochloride, followed by scavenglng wlth zilrconlum
hydroxlde and extraction of the uranlum from hydrochlorle acld
solution with trlisooctylamine-xylene. The technique has been
applied successfully to the determination of uranlum-237 1n

homogeneous reactor fuel solutions.

Preparation and Standardization of Uranlum Carrier
Welgh out approximately 50 grams of uranyl nitrate hexahydrate.

Dissolve and make to 1 liter with 2 M nltrlec acid. Standardize

the carrier by plpetting S5-ml. allquots into 50-ml. glase centrl-
fuge cones and preclpltating ammonium dluranate by addlng concen=-
trated ammonium hydroxide. Filter quantitatively through No. 42
Whatman filter paper and lgnite in porcelain cruclbles at 800°C.

PROCEDURE 10 . (Continued)

Procedure

In a 40-ml. tapered centrifuge tube add 1 ml. of uranium
carrier and 0.2 ml. of zirconium carrier (approximately 10 mg. per
ml. of zirconlum) to a sultable aliquot of the sample solution.
Dllute to approximately 10 ml,., mix well, and preclpltate ammonium
diurenate by the additlon of concentrated ammonium hydroxide.
Centrifuge for 2 minutes and dlscard the supernatant solution.
Wash the precipitate once with 15 ml. of ammonium hydroxide (1 to 1).

Dissolve the preclpltate in 1 to 2 ml. of concentrated hydro-
chloric acld solution, dilute to about 10 ml., add 1 ml. of
hydroxylamine hydrochloride (5 M), and mix well. Precipltate
zlrconlum hydroxlde by the addltlon of concentrated ammonium
hydroxide. Centrifuge for 2 minutes, add 0.2 ml. of zirconium
carrier, and stlr the supernatant solution, belng careful not to
disturb the precipitate. Centrifuge for 2 minutes. Add 0.2 ml.
of zlrconlum carrler and repsat.

Transfer the supernatant solution to another 40-ml. centri-
fuge tube, add several drops of phenolphthalein, and adjust the
pH to approximately 8 by adding concentrated hydrochloric acld
solution dropwise. Add an equal volume of concentrated hydro-
chloric acid solution and extract for approximately 0.5 mlnute
witha one-half volume portion of 5% (w./v.) triiscoctylamine-
xylene. Discard the aqueous phase. Wash the organle phase by
mixing for 0.5 minute with an equal volume portion of 5 M hydro-
chloric acld solution. Repeat the wash step. Strlp the uranium
from the organic phase by mlxlng thoroughly with an equal volume
portion of 0.1 M hydrochloris acld solution for 0.5 minute. Dlscard
the organlc phase.

Add 0.2 ml. of zirconium carrler, mix well, and repeat the
"above procedure, beginning with the precipitation of ammonium

dluranate.

295
PROCEDURE 10 (Continued)

Finally, precipltate ammonium diuranate by the additlon. of
concentrated ammonium hydroxide. Centrifuge for 2 minutes. De-
cant and discard the supernatant solution. Filter on No. 42 What-
man filter paper and ignite at 800°C. for 30 minutes.

Weigh the uranium oxide on a tared eluminum foll (0.0009
inch), fold, and place in a 10 x 75 mm. culture tube. Insert a
gultable cork and count the uranium-237 gamma radloactivity in a
well-type scintillation counter. Count the same day of the last
chemical separation.

Apply a blank correctlon if very low uranium-237 levels are
being determined. Determine this correction by taking the same
aliquot of uranium carrier through the exact procedure described
above. The blank correction 1s due primarily to the gamma radlo-

actlvlity assoclated wlth the uranium-235 in the uranlum carrier.

Editor's note: Uranium has been separated from a 5000~-fold
excess of bismuth by the following method. Uranlum is; however,
not completely extracted (only 98.48% at pH values greater than
6.5). If thls correction is applied, uranium 1s quantitatively

Severed by polarographic means within an experimental error
of *1%.

"Reagents
Acetylacetone. Commerclal acetylacetone was purified by
the method described by Stelnbach and Freiger.2

Procedure
Analysis. The method of Souchay and Faucherre,2 using 0.1M
EDTA and 2M sodium acetate as a supporting electrolyte, was found
to be suitable In the presence of dissolved acetylacetone. The
half-wave potentlal was shifted to -0.47 volt but the wave height .

was not affected.

296
PROCEDURE 11 (Continued)

Separation. Solutlons of uranyl sulfate containing 0.1 and
1.0 mg. of uranium were mixed with different amounts of bismuth
trichloride solution. A solution of the dlsodium salt of EDTA was
added to give a bismuth to EDTA ratio of 1 to 30. The pH of the
mixture was ralsed to 7.5 by careful addition of 1N sodium hydroxide.
Then approximately 10 ml. of acetylacetone was added and the mix-
ture shaken for 10 minutes. The acetylacetone phase was separated,
filtered, and made up to a volume of 10 ml., of which 2 ml. was
wlthdrawn by a plpet into a 10-ml. borosllicate glass volumetric
flask. The flask was very gently warmed until the liquid was re-
duced in volume to about 0.5 ml. Then the supporting electrolyte
was added and the resulting solution deaerated for 5 minutes in
a 10-ml. Lingane-Laltlnen H-type polarographic electrolysis cell.
The polarogram was then recorded and the concentration of uranium

found from sultable callbratlon curves.

Abstract

A double cupferron separation of uranium using extraction
has been adapted to the micro level. Uranium(VI) does not extract
in the first stage, which removes many potentially interfering
elements. Uranium(IV), obtalned in the residual aqueous solution
by reduction at a mercury cathode, 1s simultaneously extracted as

the cupferrate into ether, from which it can be re-extracted into

nitric acid. A relatively simple one-plece glass apparatus is
used for all operations. The uranium recovery at the milligram
level in an initial 30-ml. sample was determined colorimetrically
as 94%. With 0.03 t0 0.13 ¥ of radioactive uranium-233 tracer

and 20 y¥ of natural uranium as carrier, the recovery is B6%;

the latter includes the additional step of electrodepositlon of
the uranium onto a platinum planchet prior to measurement by alpha
counting, which 1s only 94% complete, The decontamination possible
with this procedure was checked with 0.07 y quantitles of uranium-
233 in the presence of high mixed flsslon product activities; 85%
recovery. was obtained, contelning only 0.9% of the fission product
glpha activity (assumed to be uranium).

Apparatus
The reactlon cell and simple electrical c¢ircult used 1s

shown in the accompanying figure.

The electrolysls vessel, CG, 18 protected from meroury ions
diffusing from the working reference oalomel electrode, A, by a
medium glass frit between B and C, and a fine frit backed with
en agar plug between B and A. Between runs, cell C 1s kept filled
with saturated potassium ohloride solution.

The apparatus for the electrodepositlon of uranium onto
platinum disks or planchets and for alpha-counting measurement
of the resulting uranium plates have been described. Beta
aotivity was measured by a chlorlne-quenched argon-filled Gelger-
Muller counter (1.4 mg. per sq. om. of window) with a Model 165
scaler; a sointillation well counter with a thalllum-dctivated
godlum iodide crystal and a Model 162 scaler was used for gamma-
activity measurement of solutions (ca. 5 ml.) contained in a 13
x 150 mm. test tube. The scalers end counters are made by the
Nuclear Instrument and Chemlocal Corp. For examlnatlon of the

gamma-ray spectrum, a gamma-ray scintillation spectrometer (built

in the Department of Chemistry, Unlversity of Michigan) was used
through the courtesy of W. Wayne Melnke.

Reagents
All chemicals used were of C.P. or reagent grade unless

otherwise speclfied. The ethereal cupferron solution used (200
to 300 mg. of cupferron per 50 ml.) was actually a hydrogen oup-
ferrate solution; the ether and cupferron were mixed ln a mixing
eylinder with 5 to 10 ml. of 10 to 20% sulfuric acid and shaken

until dissolution was complete.

Procedures

Reductive Extraction. At the commencement of a run, brldge
B 1s flushed through stopcock 2 by filling B wlth fresh potasslum
chloride solution from the funnel through 1. C is drained and
rinsed; 1 1s left open for a time to flush the frit. With 3 closed,
4 to 5 ml. of triple-distilled mercury 1s placed in C. About 30 ml.
of uranyl sulfate solution (0.5 to 5 mg. of uranium and 0.5 to 1.5%
in sulfuric acld) 1s added and a potential of -0.35 volt vs.
S.C.E. 18 applied to the mercury. About 15 to 20 ml. of the
ether cupferron solution 18 added. Stirring 1s adjusted at Just
over the minimal rate for efficlent current flow (usually about
0.2 ma. flows without stirring and 1.2 to 2.6 ma. with stirring).

Stopcock 1 is opened for about 30 seconds at approximately
S5-minute intervals throughout the run to minlmlze any loss of
uranium into the bridge. At 15~ or 20-minute intervals, stirring
18 interrupted, the ether extract 1s bled through stopcock 4 into
cell D, and 15 to 20 ml. of fresh ether-cupferron solution 1s added.
Runs of 40- to 55-minute total duration appear to be adequate.
Three increments of ether-cupferron solution were usually used,
" followed By a 5=- to 10-ml. pure ether rlnse at the conclusion of
“the run. (See Note 1.)

Extraction and Measurement at Microgram Urahlum Level. A
golution of uranium-233 (107 to 10~8 gram) together with about
20 v of natural uranium (as sulfate) was submitted to reductive
extraction with cupferron for about 50 to 60 minutes. The
uranium (IV/III) cupferrate was then re-extracted in cell. D from

the ether solution into three successlve 15-ml. portions of ™

PROCEDURE 12 (Continued)

nitric acid. The comblned nitric acid extract was evaporated to
about 5 ml., treated with 25 to 30 ml. of concentrated nitric and
2 ml. of perchloric acld, and then evaporated to dryness. The
residue was digested with 10 ml. of 0.1M nitric acid for a few
minutes; the solution obtalned, after addition of about 10. y more
of natural uranium (as sulfate), was used for electrodeposition
of the uranlum onto a platinum planchet from an oxalate medium.2
A windowless flow counter wlth Q-gas was used for counting the
alpha emission from the electrodeposited uranium.2

The whole operation took about 4 to 5 hours. Each SeasUDe~
ment of alphae from the samples was callbrated by counting a
uranium oxide standard (National Bureau of Standards No. 836-5).

Note 1. In some runs the current dropped to a low level soon
after the requisite number of eoulembs had passed for about a 3-
electron reduction of the uranium present. In other cases, the
current dld not decrease, but dlscontlnuance of the run beyond
any pcint where twlce the theoretical current had pabsed gave
patliefactory uranium recovery. In the latter cases, a gray ether-
insoluble, but alcohol-soluble precipitate (apparently a mercury
cupferrate), was usually evident in the agueous phase. The cur=
rent efflclericy for the deslred process appeared to be good in
most runs.

The combined ether extracts may be re-extracted in cell D by
inserting a clean stlrrer, or they may be transferred with rinsing
into a clean separatory funnel. Three extractions with 20 to 30
ml. each of 0.5M, 4M, and O.5M nitric acid were adequate to re-

extract uranium into aqueous solution.

Abstract

The development of solvent-extraction methods for deter-
mining trace amounts of uranium-233 in 1lrradiated thorium is
described. Thorium and 1lts alpha-emitting daughters are com-
plexed with EDTA, and, when uranlium-233 1s extracted as 1ts di-
ethyldithlocarbamate complex, only blesmuth-212 accompanles it.
This 1s immaterlal for colorimetric or fluorimetric finishes, but,
for determination of the uranium-233 by alpha counting, the
bismuth-212 must first be allowed to decay. If, however, the
uranium-233 1s extracted gs 1ts 8-hydroxyquinoline oomplex, no
alpha emitter accompanies lt and concentrations of uranlum-233
ranging from 100 ug per ml down to 0.01 pg per ml in 0.7 M
thorium solution have been determined ln this way.

PROCEDURE 15: Use of Ion Exchange Resins for the Determination
of Uranium in Ores and Solutions.

Source. 8. Fisher and R. Kunin, Anal. Chem. 29, 400 (1957).

Abstract

The separation of uranlum from the lons Interferlng with ite
analysls 1s accomplished by the adsorption of the uranium(VI) sul-
fate complex on a quaternary ammonium anion exchange resin. Inter-
ference of such lons as iron(III) and vanadium(V) is avoided by
thelr preferentlal reduction with sulfurous acid so that they, as
well as other cations, are not retained by the resin. Uranium is
eluted for analysls by dllute perchloric acid. The method is

applicable to both solutlons and ores.

Ore Solution

Two methods for the opening of uranlum-bearing ores were
Investigated 1n conjunction with the lon exchange separation. The
flrst 1s the standard digestion wlth hydrofluoric and nitric acids,
with subsequent evaporation to dryness followed by a sodlum car-
bonate fusion.2 The carbonate melt 1s dissolved in 5% sulfuric
acld to form a solution for the separation. A second method for
routine enalysls, designed to eliminate the need for hood facili-
tles and platinum veseels, involves an oxldatlive leach with an
acidic manganese(IV) oxide system. This procedure 1s given in
detail below. Other workers?, using the authors! separation
procedure, have recommended solution of the ore by treatment with

12M hydrochloric acid plus 16M nitric acid followed by fuming

307
PROCEDURE 15 (Continued)

with sulfuric acid to produce a suitable uranium solution for the
column influent.

Procedure. Welgh out samples of ore estimated to contain
an amount of uranium oxlde less than 100 mg. but sufficient to be
detected by the chosen method of analysis. Add 20 ml. of 20% by
volume sulfuric acld and 2 grams of manganese(IV) oxide. Heat
the mixture to bolling. Allow to cool to room temperature. Dilute
with approximately 50 ml. of water. Adjust to a pH between 1.0
and 1.5 by the dropwise addition of 20% sodium hydroxide. Filter
through fine-pore filter paper using two 10-m1. portions of water

to wash the residue on the paper.

Ion Exchange Separation

Apparatus. Tubes 0.5 inch in dlameter with high-porosity
sintered glass fllter disks fused to the lower end are used to
contain the resin, The rate of flow of solutions through the
tube 18 regulated by a screw clamp on rubber tubing below the
filter. Small separatory funhels are attached to the top of the
column to feed the sample and reagents.

Procedure. Convert a portion of quaternary ammonium anion
exchange resin (Amberlite XE-117, Type 2) of mesh size 40 to 60
(U.S. screens) to the sulfate form by treating a column of it with
10% sulfurlo acld, using 3 volumes per volume of resin. Rinse the
acld-treated resin with delonlzed water until the effluent 1s
neutral to methyl red. Drain the resin so prepared free of excess
water and store in a bottle. A 5-ml. portion of this resin 1s used
for a single analysis. The resin 18s loaded into the filter tube and
the bed so formed 1s backwashed with enough water to free it of
alr. After the resin has settled the excess water is drained off
to within 1 cm. of the top of the bed prior to the passage of the
sample through the bed.

Add 5 drops of 0.1% methylene blue to the partially neu-

308
PROCEDURE 15 (Continued)

tralized (pH 1.0 to 1.5) solution from the dissolved sodium ocar-
bonate melt or from the filtered manganese(IV) oxide leach. Add
6% sulfurous acid dropwise until the methylene blue is decolorized
and then add a 5-ml. excess. Pass the reduced pample through the
reain bed at a rate not exceeding 2 ml. per minute. Wash the sam-
ple contalner with two 10-ml. portions of water, passing the
washing through the resih bed at the same flow rate. Elute the
uranium with 50 ml. of 1M perchloric acid. Determine the uranium
content of the perchlorlec acid fraction colorimetrilcally by the
standard sodium hydroxide-hydrogen peroxide method® oi volumetri-
callyS. For colorimetric analysis standard uranium solutions
containing perchloric acld should be used in establishing the

curve.

Abstract

A technique in inorganic chromatography, with alumina and
cellulose adsorbents ln the same extraotion column, 1s described
for the separation of uranium from minerals and ores. The pur-

pose of the alumina 1s to retain arsenic and molybdenum, which

are not readily retalned by cellulose alone when ether contalning
5 per cent v/v of concentrated nitric acld, sp.gr. 1.42, 1s uped
as the extraction solvent.

METHOD FOR SAMPLES CONTAINING MOLYBDENUM OR ARSENIC OR BOTH
Solvent--Add 5 ml of concentrated nitric acid, sp.grs 1.42, to
each 95 ml of ether.

PREPARATION OF ALUMINA-CELLULOSE COLUMN--

The adsorptlon tube for the preparation of the column 1s a
glass tube about 25 em long and 1.8 cm in diameter. The upper
end 1s flared to a dlameter of about 8 ecm to form a funnel that
permits easy transfer of the sample. The lower end terminates
in a short length of narrow tubing and ls closed by a short
length of polyvinyl chloride tubing carrylng a screw clip. The
inside surface of the glass tube 1s coated wlth a sllicone in
the manner described by Burstall and Wells.2

Welgh 5 or 6 g of cellulose pulp into a stoppered flask and
cover 1t with ether-nltric acld solvent. Pour the suspension ln-
to the glass tube, agltate gently and then gently press down the
cellulose to form a homogeneous column. Wash the column wlth
about 100 ml of ether-nltric acld solvent and finally allow the
level of the solvent to fall to the top of the cellulose. Next
pour about 15 g of activated aluminium oxide’ on top of the
cellulose, pour on 30 ml of ether-nitric acld solvent and vig-
orously agltate the alumina with a glass plunger. Allow the
packing to settle. Allow the level of the ether to fall to the

surface of the alumina and the column 1s ready for use.

PREPARATION OF SAMPLE SOLUTION FROM MINERAL OR ORB=-

Welgh into a platinum dlsh sufficient of the sample to give
100 to 150 mg of U30g,» which 1s a convenlent amount for a volu-
metric determination. Decompose the sample by treatment with
nitric and hydrofluoric aclds ln the manner described by Burstall
and Wells.2 Flnally remove hydrofluoric acld by repeated evapora-
tions with nitrlc acid and take the sample to dryness. If the
addition of dilute nitric acid indicates the presence of undecom-
posed material, filter the lnsoluble residue on to a filter-paper
and ignite and fuse 1% in a nickel crucible with a few pellets
of potassium hydroxide. Then add the melt to the filtrate and
take the whole to dryness.

Add 4 ml of diluted nitric acid, 25 per cent v/v, to the
dry residue, gently warm to dissolve the mixture and then eool
the solution, which is then ready for chromatography.

EXTRACTION OF URANIUM-—-

Transfer the sample on a wad of dry cellulose pulp to the
top of the prepared alumina-cellulose colum® and extract the
uranium with 200 to 250 ml of ether-nitric acld solvent if ar-
senlc or molybdenum and arsenle 1s present in the original sample.
If molybdenum alone 18 present, the amount of solvent can be
reduced to 150 ml. Screen the column from direct sunlight. After
removal of ether from the eluate, determine the uranium volume-

Abstract

A method previously used? for determining uranium in minerals
by neutron irradiation followed by measurement of the separated
fisslon-product barium has heen extended to the determination
of uranilum-235 in admixture with uranium-234% and uranium-238.

With microgram amounts of uranium-235, short irradiations
in the Harwell pile glve ample sensitivity. Precision and
accuracy of better than +2 per cent have been achleved for a
range of uranium-235 contents covered by a factor of more than
10°,

IRRADIATION--

Solids-- Samples contalning not much more uranium-235 than
natural uranium (say, up to three times more or 2 per cent) may
be irradiated as polld; thls 18 usually U30g- For these cut a
5=cm length of 2-mm polythene tubing and seal one. end by warming
and pressing. Introduce freshly ignited analytical reagent grade
magnesium oxlde to form a compact layer 4 to 5 mm in helght at
the sealed end of the tube. Weigh the tube and contents, add
1% and re-welgh. Add a further simllar layer

of magnesium oxlde on top of the U30g and then seal the open end.
leave a free space about 1 em long between the top of the mag-
nesium oxlde layer and the seal, for ease of opening. Treat
standard end eamples similarly. Place the tubes elther 1n a
"special polythene bottle for irradiation in the pneumatic "rabbit"
of the pile or in a 33-inch aluminum can for lrradiation in the
Yaelf-perve” holes in the pile. Irradiation 1s carried out for
any required time; usually 1t is about 5 minutes. After irra-
diating, place the containers in lead shieldlng for about 15
hours. After thie perlod, tap down the contents of the polythene
tube away from one end and carefully out off the top. Empty the
contents into & 50-ml centrifuge tube. (The plug of magnesium
oxide serves to "rinse" the sample tube as it 1s emptied.) Add
2 ml of concentrated nitric acid (sp.gr. 1.%2), gently warm to
"dissolve, and finally boll off the nltrous fumes. Add 5.00 ml
of a barium solution to act as carrier (a solution of 18 g of
barium chloride, BaCl,*2H,0, in 500 ml of water).

Ligulds--For more highly enriched samples or when the amount

quantities of solid sample must he lrradlated in small slllca
ampoules. The ampoules, whlch have a capaclty of about 1 ml,
are prepared from silica tubing. After one end of each has been
sealed, the ampoules are weighed, the sample solution added from
a fine-pointed glass dropplng-tube and the ampoules re-welghed.
Pack the ampoules, after sealing the open ends, in cotton wool 1n
a 3-inch aluminium can and irradiate them in the "self-serve"
position of the plle. The time of lrradiation necessary can be
calculated from the usual activation formila; as an example, 1
pug of uranium-235 irradiated for 24 hours 1n a flux of 1012 neu-
trons per sq. cm per second glves about 5000 counts per minute
of barium-140 at 5 per cent counting efficlency, 24 hours after
the irradiation.

After removing them from the pile, place the samples and
standards in lead shlelding for about 15 hours; the maln activity
18 due to Billicon-31l. Transfer the ampoules to 100-ml tall-form
beakers contalning a few milliliters of water and 5.00 ml of
barlum carrier solution, carefully break off both ends of each
ampoule and warm to ensure thorough mlxing. Decant into centrl-
fuge tubes and wash out the ampoules and beakers with further
amall portions of water.

CHEMICAL SEPARATION=--

Evaporate the solutlon containing the irradiated uranium
and barium carrier to 5 to 6 ml and add two drops of 1 per cent
lanthanum nitrate solution. Warm if necessary to dissolve any
barium nitrate that may have crystallized, add concentrated
ammonium hydroxide dropwise untll a permanent preclipltate ls
obtained and then two drops in excess. Centrifuge and decant
into another centrifuge tube. Add methyl orange indicator, and
then hydrochlorile acid until the solutlon 1s acid. Add 2 drops
of 2 per cent strontium solutlon, about 25 ml of hydrochloric

acld = diethyl ether reagent, mix thoroughly, centrifuge and
decant. Wash the precipitate with 5 ml of reagent, centrifuge

and decant. Diesolve the barlum chloride precipitate in 3 to 2%

ml of water, re-preclpltate it by adding 20 ml of reagent, centri-
fuge and decant. Wash with 5 ml of reagent, centrifuge and decant.

Dissolve the precipitate in about 5 ml of water, add 6 drops
of lanthanum solution and 6 drops of the § per cent tellurate
solution and then about 3 mg of zinc metal powder. When the
effervescence ceases, make the solution Just ammonlacal to methyl
orange, centrifuge and decant into another tube. Add 4 drops of
1 per cent potassium iodlde solution and 2 drops of sodium hypo-
chlorite solution. Warm and set aside for 2 minutes. Acidify
wlth about 1 ml of hydrochloric acld, and add about 0.1 g of
hydroxylamlne hydrochloride. Boll under a hood until all the
iodine appears to be removed and the volume 18 reduced to 5 to
6 ml. Add 2 drops of strontium solution and 2 drops of lanthanum
solution and repeat the double barium chlorlde precipitation and
washing, as above.

Dissolve the precipitate in about 5 ml of water, add 6 drops
of lanthanum solution, and 6 drops of 1 per cent ferric chloride
solution. Make ammonlacal to methyl orange, add half a crumbled
Whatman accelerator tablet, and heat Just to bolling. Filter
through a 7-cm Whatman No. 30 fllter-paper into a centrifuge tube,
wash twlce with 2 to 3-ml portions of water. Dllute the flltrate
to about 20 ml and make slightly acid with hydrochloric acid.
Heat nearly toc bolling and add dropwise 2 ml of 20 per cent v/v
sulfuric acld. Allow the preclpltate to settle, decant, wash
with 10 ml of water, centrifuge, decant and repeat the washing
procedure to complete removal of the excess of acid.

serve for counting.

COUNTING TECHNIQUE~--~ ]

The ocountlng equipment for this work consists of (1) a
power unit (type 1082A or 200 1s sultable), (11) scaling unit
(type 200 or 1009B), (iii) time accessory unit {type 1003B},
(iv) probe unit (type 200B or 1014A). Time pulses can be ob-
talned from a master elsotrlc clock serving several unlts. A mica
end-window Geiger-Miller counter (2 mg per sq. em.), of type
EHM2, is suitable; 1t is mounted in a lead castle with a Perspex
lining and shelves.

Check the counting equipment in the normal fashlon with a
sultable beta-~emltter, such as natural uranium oxide in equllib-
rium wlth UX, and UX,. Place the sample to be counted in a
Perspex carrler and insert 1t in a shelf at a suitable distance
from the Geiger-Muller tube to attain a counting rate of 2000 to
3000 counts per minute. Count for a sufflcient time to obtain
at least 10,000 counts for each barium sulfate precipltate,
counting the preoclpltates one after another without undue delay.
Correction for growth of lanthanum-140 1s unnecessary if samples
and standards are counted within, say, 60 minutes of each other
provided the barium sulfate preclpltations are carrled out on
each nearly simultaneously.

Quantities of Uranium by Neutron Actlvation Analysis.

Source: H. A. Mahlman and G. W. Ledlcotte, Anal. Chem. 27, 823
(1955).

Abstract

Miocrogram and submlcrogram quantities of uranium have been
determined in synthetic samples, ores, and solls by neutron
radloactivation analysis. The principles of the aotlvation
enalysip method used in this determination and the prooessing of
irradlated samples are dlscussed. This method of analysis 18 a
sensitive and specific method for determining uranium ln concen-
trations as mall as 0.1 q¢ per gram with a probable rélative
standard error of 10%. Concentrations of uranium in quantities
as small as 0.0001 ¥ per gram can be determined by neutron activ
atlqr analysis.

Radloactlivation Analysis of Samples that Contaln

Uranium

Nuclear Irradiation of Sample. Welghed portions of the
samples and the comparatlve standard are put into small quartz
tubes. The tubes are closed with cork stoppers that are wrapped
in aluminum. They are then irradiated in the reactor. After
irradiation, the samples are allowed to decay about 4 hours and
are then chemically processed as described below. The synthetic
samples used in thls laboratory had been processed by a fllter
paper partition chromatography technique. After the separation,
the paper was convenlently irradiated in short pleces of quartz
tubing whose openings were plugged by means of cork stoppers.

Chemical Separation of Neptunium-239. In most neutron
activation analyses, a chemical separation ls made to isolate
the radioactivity of the element from all other radloactlve
apecies in the sample. Usually an "isotoplc carrler"--a known

amount of the natural inactive element--13 added to the solutions

317
PROCEDURE 18 (Continued)

of both the lrradlated specimen and the comparison samples. The
solutions are then processed chemlcally to 1solate the carrier
and deslred radloelement from other elements and contaminant
radloactivitles. Small amounts of other elements are added as
holdback or eoavenging carriers to assist in the decontamination
process.

Although neptunlum-239 has a convenlent half life, lt does
‘not have a stable lsctope that can be used as an'isotoplc carrier.
However, Seaborg2 has shown that trace quantities of neptunium-
239 can be quantitatively carried on a nonisotoplc carrier, such
as cerlum. The method of analysis reported below uses lanthanum
as a nonlsotoplc carrier for the neptunium-239 radioactivity.

(See Note 1.)

Chemlcal Separation Procedure. PREPARATION. The irradiated
ore and soll speclmens are dissolved by digestion in a mixture of
concentrated nitrile, hydrofluoric, perchlorie, and sulfuric
acids. (Additional hydrofluoric acid can be added if a residue
of silica remains ln the bottom of the crucible.) After dissolu-
tlon, the sample 1s concentrated to heavy sulfuric acld fumes,
cooled, and transferred to a 15-ml. centrifuge tube. If a residue
(sulfate salts) remains after the transfer, the solution is cen-
trlfuged for 5 mlnutes, the supernatant transferred to another
tube, and the residue washed with 1 ml. of 1M nitric acid. The
wash 1s added to the supernatant and the residue discarded.
(Centrifugation is always for the stipulated time and at full
speed.) The sample 1s then further processed by the procedure
reported herein.

The irradiated synthetlc samples (paper chromatograms) are
processed by carefully igniting the paper contained in a porcelain
crucible in a muffle furnace. The residue 1s dissolved in about

0.5 ml. of concentrated nitric acid. After dissolution, the

318
PROCEDURE 18 (Continued)

sample 1s transferred to a 15-ml. centrifuge tube and the process-
Ing continued wlth the procedure reported herein.

PROCEDURE. Three (3.0) milligrams of lanthanum and 0.250
ml. of 5M hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution are added to the
supernatant solutlon and the mixture digested for 5 minutes wlth
occaslonal stirring. The solution 1s cautiously neutralized with
concentrated ammonium hydroxide to precipitate lanthanum hydroxide,
after whlch the mixture 18 centrifuged and the supernatant liquid
discarded.

The precipitate of lanthanum hydroxide is dissolved in 2 ml.
of 2M hydrochloric acld, and 1.0 mg. of strontium (added as a
solution of strontium nltrate to serve aes a holdback or scavenging
carrier) and 0.250 ml. of 5M hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution
are added to the solutlon. The solution ls agaln digested for
5 minutes with intermittent stirring, and 0.200 ml. of concentrated
hydrofluorle acld 1s added dropwlse to the solution to precipitate
lanthanum fluoride. After centrifugation, the supernatant liquid
1s discarded and the precipitate washed with 0.5 ml. of 1M hydro~
fluoric acild-1M nitric acid solution.

After washing, the lanthanum fluorilde precipltate 1s dissolved
in 0.5 ml. of saturated boric acld solution and 1.0 ml. of 6M
nitric acid. One (1.0) milliliter each of 10% potassium perman~
ganate solution and water are added to this solution, and the
resulting mixture ls agltated well and digested for 5 minutes.
Lanthanum fluoride 1s agaln precipitated with 0.250 ml. of con-
centrated hydrofluoric acld; the solution ls centrifuged and the
supernatant llquld transferred to another centrifuge tube. The
precipitate is washed with 0.5 ml. of 1M hydrofluoric acld-1M nitrile
acid solution and the wash combined with the supernatant liquid.
The preclpltate 1s discarded.

Three milligrams of lanthanum are added to the supernatant

319
PROCEDURE 18 (Continued)

liquid, and the solution 1s digested for 5 minutes and centrifuged.
An additional 3.0 mg. of lanthanum are added to the supernatant
liquid and the solution agitated and digested for 5 minutes wlthout
disturbing the first precipitate on the bottom of the tube; then
the solution is centrifuged and the supernatant liquid transferred
to another centrifuge tube. The precipitate 18 washed wlth 0.5
ml. of 1M hydrofluoric acld-1M nitrile aeld solution; centrifuged,
and the wash comblned wlth the supernatant liquid. The precipi-
tate 1s discarded.

One milligram of zirconium (added as a solution of zirconium
nltrate to serve as a holdback or scavenglng carrier) and 0.250 ml.
of 5M hydroxylamine hydrochloride are added to the solution and
the mixture agltated and digested 5 minutes. Three (3.0) milli-
grams of lanthanum and 2 ml. of 2M hydrofluoric acld are added
to the solution, and the solution is digested for 20 minutes and
then centrifuged. The supernatant liquid 1s dlscarded. The pre-
clpitate is washed with 0.5 ml. of 1M hydrofluoric acild-1M nitrie
acld solution, and the resulting mixture 1s centrifuged. The
wash solution 1s dlscarded after the centrifugation.

The precipitate 1s slurried in a small amount of 1M nitric
acid (about 0.5 ml.) and transferred to a small borosilicate glass
culture tube by means of a transfer pipet. The centrifuge cone
18 rinsed wlth three 0.5-ml. portions of IM nitric acld and the
rinses transferred to the culture tube. The tube 1s stoppered
wlth a cork stopper and the y radioactivity measured by a well-
type gamma scintillation counter.

The standard sample of uranium oxide (050g) is dissolved
in nitric acid and an aliquot of the solution processed under
the same condltlons as the specimen samples. The uranium content
of the sample 1n question 1s determined by equating the ratio of
the corrected neptunlum-239 radlioactlvity count in the unknown
