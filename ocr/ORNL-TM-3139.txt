SEMICONTINUOUS REDUCTIVE EXTRACTION EXPERIMENTS
IN A MILD~-STEEL FACILITY

The first hydrodynamic run (HR-4) attempted after the salt over-
flow line had been modified was cut short by the failure of tubing at
the base of the packed column and the resultant leakage of salt and
bismuth from the column. This line, as well as a transfer line on
which a resistance heater had failed, was replaced, and the bismuth and
the salt were treated with a H,~HF mixture before the hydrodynamic ex-

periments were resumed.

The subsequent experiment (HR-5) yielded useful pressure-drop data,
verified the effectiveness of changes in the overflow piping, and showed
that automating the level control for the salt jackleg provided more

nearly constant salt flow rates to the column.

MEASUREMENT OF AXIAL DISPERSION COEFFICIENTS
IN PACKED COLUMNS

We have initiated an experimental program for measuring axial dis-
persion coefficients in packed columns under conditions similar to those
that will apply in proposed reductive extraction processes; in this pro-
gram, mercury and water simulate the bismuth and molten salt. We are
using a steady-state technique in which the concentration profile of a
tracer is determined photometrically at various points along the column.
Results from seven experiments with 3/8-in.-diam Raschig ring packing
indicate that the dispersion coefficient is about 3.5 cn? /sec and has
little dependence on either the digpersed-phase flow rate or the con-

tinuous-phase flow rate.
A SIMPLIFIED METHOD FOR ESTIMATING THE EFFECT OF AXIAL DISPERSION
ON COUNTERCURRENT COLUMN PERFORMANCE

A simple, rapid method has been developed for estimating the ef-
fect of axial dispersion on the performance of countercurrent contac-
tors. The column efficiency (i.e., the ratio of the height of a con-
tactor in which no axial dispersion occurs to the height of a contactor
in which axial dispersion is present) is given as a simple function of
design parameters (extraction factor, number of transfer units, height
of a plug flow transfer unit, and the axial dispersion coefficient).
The contactor efficiency can be estimated with axial dispersion present
in one phase, or in both phases, for most operating conditions of in-
terest. The predicted values for contactor efficiency are in satis-
factory agreement with values calculated from published solutions to
the continuity equation for countercurrent flow with axial dispersion

and mass transfer between phases.

EFFECT OF AXIAL DISPERSION IN PACKED COLUMN CONTACTORS
USED FOR MSBR PROCESSING

We have completed calculations that show the effect of axial dis-
persion in packed column contactors specified by MSBR processing flow-
sheets. These calculations indicate that the efficiency of the columns
used for isolating protactinium is high and that axial dispersion will
require the length of such columns to be increased by less than 10%
over that for columns in which no axial dispersion is present. The
calculated efficiencies for the rare~earth columns are quite low; thus
we conclude that axial dispersion preventers or staging would be re-~

quired for these columns.
AXTAL DISPERSION IN AN OPEN BUBBLE COLUMN

Axial dispersion in an air-water system was studied as a function
of gas and liquid flow rates in a 2-in.-ID open bubble column. The
degree of mixing was characterized by a dispersion coefficient defined
in a manner analogous to Fick's law. The experimental technique in-
volved continuously injecting Cu(NO,) , tracer and measuring the tracer
concentration gradient along the length of the column at steady state
by a photometric technique. Within the range of operating conditions
studied, the dispersion coefficient was found to be independent of
liquid flow rate. The dispersion coefficient increased from 26.9
em? /sec to 35 em’ /sec as the volumetric gas flow rate was increased
from 5.2 m/sec to 44 m/sec. At gas flow rates higher than 44
em /sec, it was more dependent on gas flow rate and increased to a
value of 68.7 en’ sec at a gas flow rate of 107 cm/sec. The experi-
mentally determined values for the dispersion coefficient are higher

than the values reported in the literature.
ELECTROLYTIC CELL DEVELOPMENT: STATIC CELL EXPERIMENTS

Experiments directed toward two problems related to cell develop-
ment were carried out in static cells. Results showed that a protec-
tive layer of frozen salt could be maintained on a surface in the pres-
ence of high heat generation rates in adjacent salt. An experiment in
which lead-acid batteries were used to provide dc power showed that the
ac ripple in the nominal dc power in previous experiments was not re-

sponsible for the formation of dark-colored material in the salt.

DESIGN AND INSTALLATION OF THE FLOW ELECTROLYTIC
CELL FACILITY

A facility for continuously circulating molten salt and bismuth
through electrolytic cells at temperatures up to 600°C is being in-

stalled. The equipment associated with this facility will allow us to
test a variety of cell designs under conditions similar to those ex —
pected in processing plants. The equipment consists of a 16-in,-diam
vessel that will contain the cell to be tested, a mixer~settler tank

in which the salt and bismuth streams from the cells will be equili-
brated, gas-1lift pumps and orifice--head pot flowmeters for circulating
and metering the streams to the cell, and a vessel containing a graph-

ite crucible for purifying the salt and bismuth.

CALIBRATION OF AN ORIFICE-HEAD POT FLOWMETER WITH MOLTEN
SALT AND BISMUTH

The Flow Electrolytic Cell Facility contains orifice-~head pot flow-
meters for measuring salt and bismuth flow rates. Calibration of this
equipment is being carried out prior to operation of the facility to
ensure that uncertainties in flow rates will be acceptably small. Ini-
tial tests with mercury and water in a Lucite head pot showed the need
for an enlarged drainage chamber downstream of the orifice. Subsequent
experiments with transient flows resulted in average orifice coeffi~
cients of 0.663 and 0.709 for mercury and water, respectively, Experi-
ments with transient flows of bismuth and molten salt through a mild~-
steel head pot at 600°C resulted in average orifice coefficients of
0.646 and 0.402, respectively. Experiments with steady bismuth flows

resulted in an average orifice coefficient of 0.654,

BISMUTH~SALT INTERFACE DETECTOR

A salt-metal interface detection device is needed for use with
salt-metal extraction columns. A modified version of an induction tvpe
of liquid-level probe is under study. The inductance coil consists of
a bifilar winding of 30-gage platinum wire wound in grooves on the sur-

face of a lavite form. For testing, the detector coil will be mounted
on a type 316 stainless steel tube having an outside diameter of 0.050
in. and a wall thickness of 0.065 in. Portions of the tube that are in
contact with bismuth will be coated with a 0.005~in. layer of tungsten

to prevent attack of the stainless steel by the bismuth.

STRIPPING OF ThE, FROM MOLTEN SALT
BY REDUCTIVE EXTRACTION

Efficient operation of the reductive extraction system for rare-

earth removal requires that only a negligible quantity of Th remain

F
Ch
in the salt which passes through the electrolytic cell and returns to
the bottom of the extraction column. Calculated results show that

ThE, can be removed from the salt to the extent required by reductive

extraction, using two to three theoretical stages.
1. INTRODUCTION

A molten-salt breeder reactor (MSBR) will be fueled with a molten
fluoride mixture that will circulate through the blanket and core regions
of the reactor and through the primary heat exchangers. We are develop-
ing processing methods for use in a close-coupled facility for removing
fission products; corrosion products, and fissile materials from the

molten fluoride mixture.

Several operations associated with MSBR processing are under studv.
The remaining parts of this report describe: (1) experiments on the
hydrodynamics of packed column operation, carried out in a mild-steel
reductive extraction facility, (2) measurement of axial dispersion in
packed columns in which immiscible fluids having large density differ~
ences are flowing countercurrently, (3) a simplified method for esti-
mating the effect of axial dispersion on countercurrent column perfor-
mance, (4) estimates of the effect of axial dispersion in packed col-
umn contactors used for MSBR processing, (5) measurements of axial dis-
persion coefficients in an open bubble column, (6) experiments related
to the development of electrolytic cells for use with molten salt and
bismuth, (7) the design and installation of the Flow Electrolytic Cell
Facility, (8) the calibration of an orifice.-head pot flowmeter for use
with the Flow Electrolytic Cell Facility, (9) the development of an
induction type of bismuth-salt interface detector, and (10) calculations
regarding the removal of Th¥, from molten-salt streams by reductive ex-
traction. This work was carried out in the Chemical Technology Division

during the period July through September 1969.

The first hydrodynamic run (HR-4) attempted after the salt over-

flow line had been modified” was cut short by the failure of tubing at
~

the base of the packed column and the resultant leakage of salt and hig-
muth from the column. This line, as well as a transfer line on which a

resistance heater had failed, was replaced and the bismuth and salt were
treated with a H,-HF mixture hefore the hydrodynamic experiments were

resumed.

mt

The subsequent experiment (HR-5) vielded useful pressure~drop data,
verified the effectiveness of changes in the overflow piping, and showed
that automating the level control for the salt jackleg provided more

nearly constant salt flow rates to the column.

2.1 Hydrodynamic Run HR-4

The objectives of the fourth hvdrodvnamic experiment (Run HR-4)

were: (1) to test the effectiveness of revisions in the salt overflow

 

line, and (2) to investigate a new method for controlling the liquid
level in the salt jackleg. However, this run had to be terminated after
only 5 min of operation because galt and bismuth were found to he leaking
from the bismuth overflow line near the hage of the column. ¥o useful

hydrodynamic data were obtained,

Pxamination of the 3/8-in.-diam mild steel tubing disclosed the

 

presence of two holes — one about 1/8 in. diam and the othet essential ly
a crack. The aoecond, crack-Like hole was locnted abheut 2 in. above the

 

Cirat bole at the functure of the tubing with a weld fillet, which ar-

hed the tube fo the

   

the column. Metallegraphic examination

of transverse and longitudinal sections of the tohing indicated that

the failures were probably due te oxidation hy external air. The ab-
sence of cracks or grain distortion in areas near the failures indicated

that stress was probably pot a factor. Although the inside surface of

3

the Line was ¢lighiily roughened, there was ne other indication of attack

hiegmuth, | T%

he outer surface was much more lrvegu’ar,

 

hy the molten salt and

especially din the areas near the failures. Measurements showed that the
wall thickness of the section that had been in service for the longest
period of time (>500 hr) had been reduced from 0.058 in. to as little

as 0.010 in. in some locations.

A second failure occurred inthe 3/8-in. steel transfer line comn-
necting the bismuth receiver and the treatment vessel; however, it did
not result in the loss of salt or bismuth. Shortly after this line was
heated to about 700°C in order to melt a suspected salt plug, the re-
sistance heater grounded to the tubing and burned a hole in the tubing.
Examination of the tubing revealed no clues as to the cause of the for-~
mation of the salt plug; the internal surfaces were free of metal or
salt deposits, and both the internal and the external surfaces had suf-

fered little corrosion.

2.2 Treatment of Bismuth and Salt with H,-HF

After the two transfer lines had been replaced, the salt and bis-
muth were transferred to the treatment vessel for purification. The
procedure was substantially the same as that described previously’;
that is, the two phases were sparged with a 75-25 mole % H,-HF mixture
at the rate of 16 scfh for 23 hr in order to remove oxides. The HF
utilization ranged from 107% initially to about 1 to 2% at the time
treatment was terminated. The flow of the H,-HF mixture was interrupted
twice when a small amount of material (salt-like in appearance) collected

in the off-gas line.

2.3 Hydrodynamic Run HR-5

The system modifications that were made prior to Run HR-4 to improve
the control of the salt and bismuth flow rates were shown to be effective
during Run HR-5. The automatic level control for the salt jackleg held
the liquid level constant to within + 0.05 in. The bismuth drain line
on the salt overflow loop prevented accumulation of bismuth at this point,

which had been a source of difficulty previously. The salt and bismuth
flow rates remained within about + 27 of the desired values during
several selected time intervals, The freeze valve below the bismuth
entrainment detector was operated in the open position, and no measure-

ments were made of bismuth accumulation resulting from entrainment.

Run HR-5 began with a 28-min period of bismuth flow only, during
which the flow vate was stable at 80 mi/win (nominal). Sali flow was
then started, and about 20 min of operation was required for the salt
flow rate to become steady. However, approximately 15 min of this time

period was required to fill the salt jackleg.

During Run HR-5, stable flows of salt and bismuth were obtained at
six sets of flow rates, as shown in Table 1. Of these flow rates, five
represented nonflooded conditions. Rates that were interpreted as
flooding rates are those occurring during periods of high (and increas-
ing) apparent bismuth holdup in the column. Such a period is usually
followed by a period of unstable flow of both phases. Table 1 also shows
the apparent bismuth hoidup in the column during the periods of steady
flow. (There is no provision for measuring holdup directly.) The ap-
parent holdup is defined as the holdup that is necessary to produce the
observed pressure drop. This value will normally be less than the ac~
tual holdup since part of the weight of the bismuth Is supported by the
packing and does not contribute to the pressure drop of the continuous

phase.

Apparent holdup seems to be strongly dependent upon Vis the dis-
persed-phase superficial velocity, but is almost independent of Veo the
cont inuous~phase superficial velocity. This is shown most strikingly
by a comparison of time intervals 4 and 5, during which the apparent

holdup failed to change even though V_ was doubled.

3. MEASUREMENT OF AXIAL DISPERSION COEFFICIENTS IN PACKED COLUMNS

J. SS. Watson L.. E. McNeese

Axial dispersion in the continuous (salt) phase can reduce the per-
formance of the packed column contactors that are proposed for the MSBR
fuel processing system. Effects of axial dispersion will be most severe
in the rare-earth removal columns, where high flow ratios are required.
We have initiated an experimental program in which axial dispersion
coefficients in packed columns are measured under conditions similar to
those in the proposed reductive extraction processes; in this program,
mercury and water simulate bismuth and molten salt. The measured axial
dispersion coefficients will be used to estimate column performance in
the proposed systems. If the required heights for ordinary packed col~
umns are found to be excessive, devices for reducing axial dispersion

will be developed.

3.1 Mathematical Model

A steady-state technique was used in making the axial dispersion
coefficient measurements; its theoretical development was as follows.
Consider a column of constant cross section in which a fluid moves with
constant superficial velocity, v. If a tracer material is introduced
near the column exit, the tracer will tend to diffuse upstream and a
concentration profile will be established. At steady state, the flux
of the tracer due to axial dispersion is equal to the convective flux;

that is,

Integration of this relation, assuming that the concentration at point
21 is Ci» yields the relation

vo,
- FE (Z zy) > (2)
which indicates that a semilogarithmic plot of c/c, vs Z should yield

a straight line of slope -v/E.

3.2 Experimental Technique and Equipment

The experimental technique for measuring the concentration profile
is illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2. Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of the
column and sampling system; Fig. 2 is a photograph of the column with
the associated samplers. A small stream of water (flow rate, approxi-
mately 1 ml/min) is withdrawn from the column, circulated through a cell
containing a light source and a photocell, and then returned to ithe col-
umn at the same elevation. The circulating stream is driven by a small
centrifugal pump that uses a magnetically coupled impeller (Fig. 3).

The photocells are cylindrical in shape and have a 1/2-in. inside diam-
eter. The light path, 1/2 in. in length, lies along the axis of the
cell. The light source is a G.E. No. 253X lamp, and the detectors are

Clairex CL707L photoresistors. Two photocells are shown in Fig. 4.

The tracer material, which consists of an aqueous solution of

Cu (NO is injected near the top of the column with a syringe pump.

3 ps
Several sampling points are located at various positions down the col-
umn. The tracer concentration in each photocell is observed until
steady state is reached; with a 4~ft column, this normally takes 2 to

4 hr. The solutions to be analyzed are very dilute, and the response
of the photoresistors is essentially linear (a limiting form of Beer's
law) as confirmed by experiment. Readings from each detector are taken

both with no tracer present (i.e., with the column containing water) and

with a single calibration solution. The calibration solution is gen-

erated by injecting a small amount of tracer into the column when no
water is flowing; after the tracer has been mixed throughout the col-
umn, each detector can be calibrated at the same tracer concentration.
Such a calibration is made at the beginning of each run. This procedure
requires that only relative concentrations, rather than absolute con-

centrations, be measured.

3.3 Experimental Results

The results of seven runs with 3/8-in.-diam Raschig rings are shown
in Figs. 5 through 11; they are summarized in Table 2 and Fig. 12, Var-
ious mercury and water flow rates were used to determine whether the dis-
persion coefficient is a function of either the dispersed-phase or the
continuous-phase flow rate, Figure 12 shows the measured values as a
function of the mercury flow rate (the dispersed-phase flow rate was
considered more likely to affect axial dispersion). Although consid-
erable scatter exists in the data, there is no evidence that the dis-
persion coefficient is affected by either of the flow rates. The
scatter of the data is most severe at high mercury flow rates, where
mercury tends to enter the sample ports, and at both high and low
water flow rates, where the concentration profile is either too steep
or too shallow for accurate determination of the slope. All of
these data were taken at less than 50% of the flooding rate. Although
subsequent experiments may show that the axial dispersion coefficient
is essentially constant over a wider range of flow rates, one should
not presently extrapolate these findings to flooding conditions. Tt
is known that holdup and drop size change significantly just before
flooding occurs; it is possible that the axial dispersion coefficient

may also change.

4, A SIMPLIFIED METHOD FOR ESTIMATING THE EFFECT OF AXIAL
DISPERSION ON COUNTERCURRENT COLUMN PERFORMANCE

J. 5. Watson H. D. Cochran, Jr,

In the decade since Sieicher,’ Miyauchi and Vermeulen, and Hartland
and Mecklenburgh’ published solutions to che continuity equation for
countercurrent flow in extraction or absorption towers with axial dis-
persion, numerous authors have cited their work. Doubtless, many in-
dustrial organizations have also employed their solutions. Despite this
attention and the obvious practical importance of axial dispersion in

2
many applications, very few attempts »353,6

have been made to develop a
simpie, rapid method for estimating the effect of axial dispersion for
design purposes or for interpretation of experimental data. Even the

simplified methods that have been proposed are complex.

The objective of this study was to develop an expression for column
efficiency which consisted of a simple function of the design parameters
and directly measurable quantities only. With such an expression, the
required column height could be predicted from conventional design infor-
mation (number of transfer units required under plug flow conditions,
height of a transfer unit under plug flow conditions, and axial disper-

sion coefficient).

4,1 Definition of Column Efficiency

In discussing mass transfer in countercurrent contactors, it is con-
venient to define a column efficiency, n, which relates the performance of
a contactor in which axial dispersion is present to the performance of a

contactor in which no axial dispersion cccurs (i.e., a plug flow contactor).

Consider a system containing a reference phase x, a second phase vy,

and a solute which distributes between the phases in a linear manner, as

C, = og + wC,, s (3)
28

where
C. = concentration of solute in the reference phase,
Cy = concentration of solute in the second phase,
g = intercept. of equilibrium line,
m = slope of the equilibrium line.

For such a system, the performance of a plug flow contactor can be

described in terms of the number. of transfer units (NTU) produced, as

follows.
For F # 1, 1n - X
NTU = —2E £1 =F ’ (4)
F ~1
where

NTU = number of overall plug flow transfer units based on the
reference phase, x,

F = extraction factor, mV Vs

 

vo = flow rate of the reference phase,
Vy = flow rate of the other phase,
and
C - (g + mC, ,. |)
z= x (out) yin)” (5)
1 -¢g+mC_,,
87 ™y(in)
For F = 1,
1
NTU = X 1. (6)

Thus, the number of transfer units produced is based on a reference
phase and is dependent principally on the changes in solute concentra-

tion in the streams and the distribution coefficient between the phases.
29

The column efficiency has been defined by Sleicher as the ratio of
the height of a contactor in which axial dispersion is present to the
height of a plug flow contactor that results in the same mass transfer

performance; that is,

HTU, * NTU
so m————r——————
n 5 (7
where
n = column efficiency,
HTU_ = height of a transfer unit in a plug flow contactor,

4,2 Column Efficiency for Axial Dispersion in a Single Phase

, 3 . , .
Miyauchi and Vermeulen~ obtained a solution for mass transfer with
axial dispersion in a system having constant volumetric countercurrent
flow rates and a constant equilibrium distribution coefficient. The

boundary conditions used were those defined by Danckwerts.,’

The differential equations defining the solute concentrations in

the system were

d C dc
E —5=-V —=-%k aC - (g+mC)]=0 (8)
x az’? X 49 ox © X y
and
a%c acy
F —* -v —Z +k a[C = (g + mC)]= 0, (9)
Y az Yaz ox x
where
Es Ey = axial dispersion coefficients in the x and y phases,
respectively,

k a = the overall mass~transfer coefficient based on the ref-
erence phase x,
Z = the distance along the column axis, measured from the

reference-~phase inlet.
30

fl

The boundary conditions at Z 0 (x-phase inlet) were as follows:

dc, Vv.
rr = [c (1) - C (0)] (10)
z=0 ¥
and
dc

FE = 0. (1D

At Z = 1,
dCy Vy
1 = 3 [Cy (1) - C, (01 (12)
7=1 y
and
dC
= = 0. (13)
Z=]

These boundary conditions result from the assumption that there is
no dispersive flux across the inlet or outlet boundaries of the column.
Consequently, they result in an abrupt change in the concentration at
the entrance. The solution to these equations is complex; it is dif-
ficult to use for most design purposes since it cannot be solved ex-
plicitly for the column height or efficiency. Using the solution,
values of the column efficiency were evaluated iteratively from several
hundred cases that cover a range of operating conditions. In the gen-
eration of these values, the axial dispersion coefficient in the dis-
persed phase was assumed to be zero. It was found that the results can
be approximated over a relatively wide range of conditions by the fol-

lowing simple empirical expression:
31

nal = _—t (14)

This expression predicts column efficiencies that deviate from the exact

values by no more than 0.06 when

NTU < 2, (15a)
F < 3, (15b)
n > 0.20, (15¢)

and

It is important to note that, because the Peclet number is based
oni the height of a transfer unit for plug flow, the three required var-
iables--N, F, and NTU--contain only directly measurable quantities
or design parameters. The equation gives extremely accurate values for
large Peclet numbers where the efficiency approaches unity. Even for

NTU = 1, the equation is satisfactory for N > 1.

Pex
Equation (14) was tested for extraction factors from 4 to 0.01, for
NTU = 1, 2, and higher values up to 8 or 16 (the dependence on NTU de-

creases at high NTU), and for N 0 0.1 to 100 or higher. Several re-

Pp
presentative curves comparing the estimated efficiency to the exact ef-
ficiency are shown in Fig. 13. All of the curves could not be included
since some of them lie very near the diagonal. One curve for conditions

outside the allowable range, namely, F = 4 and NTU = 2, is included.

4.3 Column Efficiency for Axial Dispersion in Both Phases

A similar effort was made to fit values of the column efficiency
generated from the solution of Miyauchi and Vermeulen with axial dis-
persion in both phases. 1In this case, the resulting empirical equation
was compared with the tabulated results of McMullen, Miyauchi, and
Vermeulen; no new calculations of column performance were made. The
column efficiency is given approximately by the following equation:

nayl-~ L - . (16)

Npex T1 7 F F101 Npey ~ L+F ro

 

This equation predicts efficiencies that deviate from the exact values

by no more than 0.07 when

NTU

{v

2, (17a)

n > 0.20, (171)

and when the denominators of both terms on the right are positive. For

very low values of N (less than 1.5) and for values of F less than

Pey
0.25, the approximate equation becomes slightly overcorrective, and, in

turn, predicted efficiencies are too low.

A comparison of efficiency values predicted by Eq. (16) with exact
values from the tabulated results of McMullen, Mivauchi, and Vermeulen
is given in Fig. 14 for all cases satisfying the specified conditious.
The agreement is satisfactory. As in Fig. 13, the accuracy of the pre~
dicted efficiencies is found to be highest when the efficiency is

greater than 0.50.

4.4 Prediction of Required Height of Contactors in Which
Axial Dispersion Is Present
By combining the relation defining contactor efficiency [Eq. (16)]
with the empirical expressions for contactor efficiency when axial dis-
persion is present, one obtains a relation that can be used to predict
the required height of contactors in which axial dispersion occurs in

one phase or both phases. The final relation is of the form

_ (HTU) + (NTU) _ (HTU) - (NTU)
H = n - £(N,,» NTU, F) (18)

This relation is easily used and is sufficiently accurate for
estimating the performance of most countercurrent absorption or extrac-
tion columns of interest. Moreover, the accuracy decreases only in cases
where the column performance is very poor; in such cases, the estimate
will clearly reveal the need for exact solutions. In any event, the
estimated efficiency will serve to indicate whether axial dispersion is
important in a particular application. The method is believed to be ap-
plicable under most conditions encountered in practice, and the accuracy
is consistent with the usual uncertainties in values for HTU and Nooo
Although the distribution coefficient may not be constant in some appli-
cations, the assumption of a constant distribution coefficient is in-
herent in the published solutions to the continuity equation. This
method of estimation should prove useful in many design studies as well
as in making assessments of the effect of dispersion on laboratory- and
pilot-scale experiments. Although correlations for axial dispersion coef-
ficients are not readily available, data obtained from several types of
contactors have been reported. In many instances, the lack of data on
axial dispersion can be used as an argument for using the simple rela-
tionships suggested in this study rather than the more complex exact
solution. It is believed that less complicated procedures, such as the
one described here, will encourage the inclusion of axial dispersion
considerations in design problems and stimulate more experimental eval-

uation and correlation of axial dispersion data.

5. EFFECT OF AXIAL DISPERSION IN PACKED COLUMN CONTACTORS
USED FOR MSBR PROCESSING

J. S. Watson H. D. Cochran, Jr.

Calculations that show the effect of axial dispersion in packed col-
umn contactors specified by MSBR processing flowsheets have been made
using the method developed for estimating the effect of axial dispersion
in countercurrent contactors (discussed in Sect. 4) and values for the
axial dispersion coefficient experimentally determined in a 2-in.-~diam
column packed with 3/8-in. Raschig rings (Sect. 3). The flowsheet calls
for packed column contactors in both the protactinium isolation system
and the rare-earth removal system. The contactors in each of the systems
consist of an upper section and a lower section operating under different
conditions. In each case, the number of transfer units required (NTU),
the extraction factor (F), and the Peclet Number Wp) were estimated for
the columns from flowsheet calculations made by McNeese for the reference
flowsheet conditions.’ These values were then used in calculating the
column efficiency (n) and the required column length a’. The results

of these calculations are summarized in Table 3.

In the case of the protactinium isolation columns, where the assump-
tion of a constant distribution coefficient (D) is poor, calculations were
made for several values of the distribution coefficient over its range
of variation. It was found that the results are largely independent of
the value of D. The most important observation was that the efficiencies
of the columns are high; that is, dispersion will require the length of
the column to be increased by less than 10% over that in which no dis-

persion occurs. The estimate of HTU (3.2 ft) used in calculating Noe
and L* was taken from the experimental results of Johnson et al.” A

value of 3.5 cm? / sec for E was used in calculating Npe* This number is
based on measurements made with columns packed with 3/8-in. Raschig rings

(described in Sect. 3). The calculated column heights are acceptably low.

For the rare-earth removal system, rare earth--thorium separation
factors (a) of 1.2, 1.5, and 2.0 were assumed. The HTU and axial dis-
persion coefficient values (i.e., 3.2 ft and 3.5 en’ /sec, respectively)
that were used in making calculations for the protactinium system were
also assumed to apply for the rare-earth columns. ‘In the upper column,
efficiencies were quite low and strongly dependent on Noo and NTU. It
appears likely that column heights will be excessive in this section.
In the lower part of the rare-earth system, low efficiencies and the
need for very long columns are certain since the Peclet number is low
and the number of required transfer units is high. It is concluded that
axial dispersion preventers or staged columns will be necessary in the

rare-earth removal system. A study of devices for reducing axial dis-

persion in columns has been initiated.

6. AXIAL DISPERSION IN AN OPEN BUBBLE COLUMN

M. S. Bautista L. E. McNeese

Bubble reactors are commonly used in industrial processes to carry
out reactions between a gas phase and a liquid phase. This type of re~
actor is being developed for recovering uranium from molten salt streams.
In operation, fluorine gas is bubbled countercurrently through the molten
salt in an open column. Fluorine, which is absorbed in the molten salt,
reacts with the uranium to form UF. The volatile UE, is carried out of
the column in the gas stream. One problem associated with a bubble re-
actor is the inherent axial dispersion caused by the ascending bubbles.
The effect of axial dispersion is an averaging of concentrations over
the length of the column and hence a decrease in the performance achiev-
able with a countercurrent system. The purpose of this investigation
was to measure axial dispersion coefficients in a bubble column for a

range of liquid and gas flow rates.
The experimental approach consisted of measuring photometrically

the axial concentration gradient of a tracer, Cu(NO which was added

3g
to the bottom of a column in which water and air were in countercurrent
flow. The axial dispersion coefficient was then calculated from the
measured concentration gradient. In a previous investigation, the
tracer concentration was determined by measuring the transmittance of
the aqueous phase containing the tracer directly through the glass col-
umn by positioning a light source and a light-detecting device (photo-
resistor) diametrically opposite each other at points along the column;
the gradient was determined by positioning the light source and photo-
resistor at known positions along the length of the column. However,
the rising bubbles and the variation of the optical properties of the
column wall made accurate transmittance measurements difficult. To
eliminate these problems, we devised a technique for measuring the
tracer concentration by slowly withdrawing a small amount of solution
from the column, pumping the solution through a photocell for analysis,

and returning the solution to the column at the same elevation.

6.1 Mathematical Model

The mathematical model used for defining the axial dispersion coef-~
ficient is analogous to Fick's law. At steady state, a mass balance on

the tracer, performed on a differential height of column, yields the

relation
2.
pdL. dE, (19)
dz” -
where
C = tracer concentration at height Z,

Hi

superficial liquid velocity,

axial dispersion coefficient,

i

height above reference point.
40

The assumptions that were used in deriving this equation were as follows:

1. The tracer concentration gradients in the angular and radial

directions are negligible.
2. The dispersion coefficient is independent of column length.
3. The effect of molecular diffusion is negligible.

The boundary conditions employed to solve this differential equation

were:
(1) at Zz = 0, C = C3
(2) at Z = L, uC = -D 2 (20)

Z=L

With these boundary conditions, the solution of the differential equation

is:

= = exp (- 2 ’ (21)

where

¢, = tracer concentration at reference point, Z = 0.

Thus, the axial dispersion coefficient can be determined by plotting
the logarithm of (c/c) vs Z, which should produce a straight line
having the slope -u/D.

6.2 Experimental Equipment

A schematic flow diagram of the experimental system is shown in
Fig. 15. Laboratory air entered the bottom of the column through a
0.04~in.-ID stainless steel tube, and distilled water was pumped to
the top of the column through a disperser that was used to distribute
the water uniformly across the column cross section. The liquid level
in the column was controlled by adjusting the height of the jackleg
through which the water exited from the column. Tracer was injected

into the bottom of the column through a stainless steel tube.

6.2.1 Bubble Column; and Air, Water, and Tracer Feed Systems

The bubble column consisted of three sections: a Lucite tube
(2 in. in inside diameter and 72 in. long), two Lucite photographic
blocks located at the ends of the tube, and two glass end pieces at-
tached to the blocks. Twenty sampling taps, spaced 3.5 in. apart
along the length of the tube, were used for measuring the tracer
concentration profile. The first tap was positioned 17.75 in. above
the bottom of the column. Each tap consisted of two Lucite tubes lo-
cated diametrically opposite each other. One tube was used for with-
drawing solution from the column, and the other was used for returning
solution. The photographic blocks were made by drilling 2 2-in.-diam
hole through a 3 x 3 x 3 in. Lucite block. Photographs could be taken

through the blocks to determine the average bubble diameter.

Laboratory air entered the bottom of the column through a 0.04~in.
stainless steel tube; the gas inlet point was approximately 4-5/8 in.
above the bottom of the column. The gas flow rate was measured by one
of two rotameters placed in parallel. The maximum volumetric flow rate
was 117 ems J sec for the largest rotameter, while the maximum flow rate
was 13.5 em’ /sec for the other rotameter. To regulate the gas flow rate,
a valve was located upstream of each rotameter. All air flow rates given
in this report are volumetric flow rates measured at the temperature and

pressure at the top of the column.

Distilled water was pumped to the top of the column by a 1/8-hp
Eastern” pump. Water was distributed uniformly over the column cross
section by a disperser made by drilling four holes through the sides of
a sealed 1/8-in.-ID stainless steel tube. The liquid flow rate was meas-
ured by a rotameter with a maximum flow rate of 3.5 cm/sec and was con-
trolled by two valves, one located upstream and one located downstream

of the rotameter.

The tracer was injected through a stainless steel tube into the
bottom of the column by a Harvard Variable Speed Continuous Automatic
Infusion Pump. The point of injection was 11-7/8 in. above the bottom

of the column.

6.2.2 Solution Sampling and Analysis System ©

A typical pump and photocell utilized for measuring the tracer con-
centration in the solution withdrawn from the column are shown in Fig.
16. Details of the pump design are shown in Fig. 17. Each of the pumps
was fabricated from Lucite and had a 0.465-1in.~long, 2~-in.=diam pump
body. : The chamber in which the impeller operated consisted of a 15/16-
in.~diam, 3/8-in.~deep hole drilled along the axis of the pump body.

The chamber was sealed by a 3/8~in.~thick, 1-in.-diam Lucite seal plate
that was machined to a diameter of 15/16 in. over a distance of 1/8 in.
The machined end of the seal plate was inserted into the pp body
chamber. The inlet to the pump consisted of a 1/8-in.-diam hole drilled
on the axis of the seal plate. The outer 1/4 in. of the inlet was
drilled and tapped to receive a 1/8-in.-ID, l-in.-long section of stain-
less steel tubing. The pump outlet consisted of a 1/8-in.-diam hole
through the pump body; the outlet was tangential to the surface of the
pump chamber. The outlet was also provided with a 1-in. section of 1/8-
in.-diam stainless steel tubing. The pump impeller consisted of a 3/4-
in.~long, Teflon~-coated magnet, which was magnetically coupled to the

pump drive system.

Details of the photocell design are shown in Fig. 18. The cell body,
fabricated from Lucite, was 1 in. in diameter and 1.75 in. long. A 0.438-
in.-diam hole was drilled from both ends of the cell body in such a man-
ner that a 1/8-in.-thick partition, 0.5 in. from one end of the cell body,
was formed. The cell compartment was formed by gluing a 0.438-in.~diam,
1/8-in.~thick Lucite disk (shaded area) inside the drilled hole, 0.5 in.
from the other end of the cell body. The inlet and the outlet of the

cell were formed by drilling two 1/16-in. holes through the solid por-
tion of the body, tangential to the inner circular surface of the cell
compartment. Two short sections of 1/16-in.-ID Lucite tubing were in-

serted into these holes.

A trap was provided between each sample outlet and the pump inlet
to prevent accumulation of bubbles inside the pump. These traps con-
sisted of Pyrex tees that were positioned in such a manner that one of
the legs pointed upward. A small section of clamped rubber tubing was
fitted over the leg pointing upward, and air was removed from the trap
by opening the clamp. To purge the cell and the pump of air, another
Pyrex tee constructed in the same manner was placed between the photo-
cell outlet and the sampling tap. The sampling tubes, trap, pump, photo-

cell, and purge tee were connected with rubber tubing.

The light source for the photocell was a GE 253X bulb, and the
transmittance of the cell was measured by a Clairex 707L photoresistor,
which has maximum sensitivity at a wavelength of 6150 A. To collimate
the light passing through the cell, the light source and the photoresistor
were mounted inside 0.436-in.-0D, 6-in.-long brass tubes that were in-

serted into the outer compartments of the cell.

The pump drive apparatus, shown in Fig. 16, consisted of a permanent
iron magnet firmly attached to an iron rod, a chuck employed to adjust the
height of the magnet above the pump, and a sprocket wheel bolted to the

iron shaft that supported the chuck.

The main drive system for the pumps consisted of two drive shafts,
one of which was located on each side of the column. The shafts were
driven at the same speed by a variable-speed electric motor. Drive
sprockets were mounted on the shafts, and nonslip sprocket belts con-

nected the drive sprockets with the pump sprockets.

6.2.3 Electronics System

The electrical schematic diagram of a cell circuit is shown in
Fig. 19. The electrical signal from the photoresistor is amplified by
a transistorized operational amplifier circuit and displayed on a
Honeywell Brown recorder (voltage range, -0.5 to 10.5 mV). Basically,
the span adjustment regulates the amplifier feedback, and the zero ad-
justment controls the amplifier input voltage. The 20 electrical cir-
cuits for the cells were connected to the recorder by two 10-position

selector switches that allowed the desired cell reading to be displayed.

6.3 Calibration of Photocells
6.3.1 Relation Between Relative Tracer Concentration and Cell Reading

A relation between the relative tracer concentration (c,/c) and
the photocell reading displayed on the recorder was developed from the
limiting case of Beer's law. Beer's law can be expressed in terms of

the transmittance of the cell as

T = exp(-abc), (22)

where
T = transmittance,
a = molar extinction coefficient,
b = cell length,
¢ = tracer concentration.

By a Taylor expansion of the exponential, (1 - T) can be shown to be
directly proportional to the tracer concentration for dilute concentra-
tions. It is assumed that the photocell reading is proportional to

(1 - T) and, therefore, proportional to the tracer concentration. Using

this approximation and assumption, the following equation can be derived:

The advantage of this approach is that a directly determined relation

between the cell reading and the tracer concentration is not required.

6.3.2 Method for Calibrating Photocells

In calibrating the photocells, it was necessary (1) to determine
the maximum tracer concentration for which the linear approximation
between the fraction of incident light absorbed (absorbance) and the
tracer concentration would be valid, and (2) to confirm the assumption
of a linear relationship between the cell reading and the tracer con-
centration. Figure 20 shows results which verify that behavior cor-
responding to Beer's law was observed. In this examination, a Beckman
infrared spectrophotometer and quartz cells (I cm in length) were used.
The data were obtained by varying the wavelength of the incident light
for several tracer concentrations and recording the transmittance for
each. The maximum sensitivity of the photoresistor occurred at a wave-

length of 6150 A. At this wavelength, a Cu(NO tracer concentration

of 0.045 M resulted in an absorbance of 0.13. The absorbance based on
the linear approximation was calculated by using this concentration and
the molar extinction coefficient at 6150 A; the error im absorbance
caused by the linear approximation was only 6% of the actual absorbance.
The tracer concentration of 0.045 M was chosen as the upper limit for the
linear approximation. The assumption of a linear relation between the
cell reading and the tracer concentration is verified by the data shown
in Fig. 21, In obtaining these data, the readings of two cells were

measured at four tracer concentrations.

The 20 photocells were calibrated initially at tracer concentrations
below the experimentally determined concentration limit by the following
procedure. First, the column was filled with distilled water. Then the
pumps were activated, and their pumping rates were adjusted to 0.12 em? / sec.
A 15-min period was allowed for the cells to reach thermal equilibrium.

The cell readings with distilled water were zeroed on the recorder by ad-
justing the voltage input to each cell amplifier. Next, the bottom cell

was disconnected from the column and filled with a 0.041 M Cu(NO solu-

3)
tion. The amplifier feedback of the cell was adjusted so that the cell
reading on the recorder was 957 of full scale. The bottom cell was re-
connected to the system. Alr flow through the column was then started

at a volumetric flow rate of 4.30 em /sec. The infusion pump was started,
and the tracer flow rate was adjusted to 0.407 cn’ / sec. Injection of
tracer was terminated when the bottom cell reading on the recorder was
80% of full scale. A uniform tracer concentration was assumed to be
present in the column when the top cell reading maintained a constant
value for 15 min. The amplifier feedback of the 19 cells was then ad-
justed so that all cell readings were equal to the reading of the bottom

cell. Finally, the column was drained, flushed, and refilled with dis-

tilled water in preparation for experimental work.

6.3.3 Preparation of Tracer Solution

Preparation of the tracer involved dissolving 230 g of laboratory-

grade Cu(NO 3H,0 crystals in a 2~liter volumetric flask half-filled

302
with distilled water, adding 20 ml of concentrated nitric acid, and
diluting to volume with distilled water. The Cu(N0,), concentration, was

approximately 0.48 M.

The nitrate anion was selected to prevent reduction of the cupric
ion. The tracer was acidified with concentrated nitric acid to further

ensure against reduction of the cupric ion.

6.4 Experimental Procedure

The cells were calibrated at the beginning of each day. The cali-
bration procedure can be described as follows. Distilled water was passed
through the column with the cell pumps operating at the rate of 0.12 jy
sec. A period of approximately 30 min was allowed to ensure complete re-
moval of tracer from previous runs and to obtain thermal equilibrium in
the cells. Cell readings for distilled water were then recorded. Next,
the second set of readings required for calibrating the cells was obtained.
Air flow was started through the column at a volumetric flow rate of 4.5
liters/min, the water flow was terminated, and tracer was injected into
the column by operating the infusion pump at the rate of 0.41 cn’ / sec.

The injection of tracer was stopped when the recorder reading of the bot-
tom cell reached 807% of full scale, and the tracer solution was allowed
to mix in the column. A uniform tracer concentration was assumed to be
present when the reading of the top cell maintained a constant value for
10 min. Cell readings for the standardized tracer concentration were

then recorded.

At the beginning of an experiment, the desired air and water flow

rates were set. Also, the liquid level in the column was adjusted to
55

prevent excessive liquid entrainment in the air stream leaving the top

of the column. An appropriate setting for the flow rate of the tracer

was chosen to ensure that the tracer concentration at the bottom of the
column would have the desired value when steady state was reached. To
avoid gas buildup inside the pumps, the traps were periodically purged

of air. Steady state was assumed to have been reached when the reading
for the top cell maintained a constant value for 10 min. To ensure that
steady-state conditions existed, the stability of the reading for the bot-
tom cell was also observed. The cell readings were then recorded, and

the subsequent experimental run was started by readjusting the water, air,

and tracer flow rates.

At the end of each day, the pumps were stopped and the column was
drained and refilled with distilled water, Water was fed through the
column for 30 min with the pumps activated in order to remove the tracer
from the cells. Cell readings taken at this time were compared with those
recorded at the beginning of the experiment. If the final value for a
particular cell deviated by more than 5% from the initial value, data

from that particular cell were discarded.

6.5 Experimental Results

Experimental data obtained during this study are presented in Figs.
22-42, which are plots of the measured values of the tracer concentration
at various points along the column for a range of operating conditions.

In general, the data points deviate only slightly from the expected linear
relationship; this deviation is believed to be the result of random scatter
in the data. The axial dispersion coefficient for each experiment was cal-

culated by a least-squares method.

Values for the axial dispersion coefficient are summarized in Fig.
43, where the dispersion coefficient is plotted as a function of the

volumetric gas flow rate at the top of the column.

6.6 Discussion of Results

6.6.1 Effects of Gas and Liquid Flow Rates on Axial Dispersion Coef-
ficient
The axial dispersion coefficient was not influenced by the super-
ficial velocity of the liquid at the flow rates used (0.131 and 0.080
cm/sec) (see Fig. 43). The results indicate that the mixing regime in
the column was the same for the two liquid velocities and that the water
velocities were not high enough to affect the bubble formation or to

attenuate the rate of rise of the bubbles.

The effect of the gas flow rate on the axial dispersion coefficient
is also shown in Fig. 43. Two distinct operating regions, which are dis-
tinguished by a sharp change in the dependence of dispersion coefficient
on gas flow rate at a flow rate of 44 em’ /sec, are observed in the figure.
Visual observations and photographs indicate a difference in bubble be-
havior in these two operating regions. At the lower gas rates, the
bubbles rise independently of each other as seen in Fig. 44, which shows
the bubble distribution at the bottom photographic block at a gas flow
rate of 16.0 cm/sec. This type of flow is denoted as "bubbly flow."
Figure 45 shows the bubble distribution at a gas flow rate of 58 em sec:
a range of bubble sizes is observed. The larger bubbles ascend more
rapidly than the smaller ones, and a considerable amount of coalescence
occurs. The coalesced bubbles grow in size until their diameter equals that
of the column, and the length of the resulting bubbles increases as the
gas flow rate is increased. This type of flow is denoted as "slug flow."
In slug flow, a circulatory flow of liquid develops around each bubble
and results in increased mixing as a result of the large bubble sizes.
From visual observations, bubble coalescence appears to begin at a gas

flow rate of about 44 em sec.

6.6.2 Comparison of Measured Dispersion Coefficients with Literature
Values
The dispersion coefficients that we measured in this work are higher
than coefficients reported in the literature (see Fig. 46). Argo and
Covall and Siemes and Weisel? usad multiple-orifice gas dispersers, which
may account for the difference in the results. However, the transition
from bubbly flow to slug flow reported by Siemes and Weiss appears to

coincide with that observed in our study.

6.7 Verification of Assumptions in Mathematical Model

Several assumptions were made in deriving the mathematical model
used for correlating the data; verification of the more important as-—

sumptions is discussed below.

6.7.1 Invariance of Dispersion Coefficient Along the Length of the
Column
The assumption of invariance of dispersion coefficient along the
length of the column is verified by the fact that straight lines are
produced when the logarithm of the reduced tracer concentration is

plotted vs column height (see Figs. 22-42).

6.7.2 Effect of Photocell Pumping Rate

Dispersion in the column could be affected by the withdrawal of
solution from, and return of solution to, the column. The magnitude of
this effect was checked by comparing axial dispersion coefficients meas-
ured at two pumping rates (0.18 cm/sec and 0.12 cm/sec) but a fixed
superficial liquid velocity (0.13 cm/sec) and gas flow rate (8.2 cm/sec).
The measured dispersion coefficients were 28.6 en sec and 28.4 em? / sec
for pumping rates of 0.12 cm/sec and 0.18 cm/sec, respectively; the

deviation of these coefficients from their average was less than 1%.

6.7.3 Effect of Tracer Feed Rate

 

The effect of tracer feed rate was determined by comparing dispersion
coefficients measured at two different tracer feed rates but at the same
liquid and gas flow rates. This effect must be considered since the lower
tracer feed rate of 0.081 em’ sec was used at the superficial liquid veloc-
ity of 0.08 cm/sec in order to avoid exceeding the tracer concentration
limit at the bottom of the column. The dispersion coefficients were 28.4
cm? / sec and 26.7 em’ / sec for tracer feed rates of 0.407 cm/sec and 0.163
an’ /sec, respectively; the deviation of each of these values from their

average value was less than 47.

6.7.4 Comparison of Tracer Concentration Profiles Measured Photometrically
and Determined by Chemical Analysis

A comparison was made of the axial dispersion coefficients determined
by the technique employed in these studies and the coefficients determined
from a tracer concentration profile that was obtained by withdrawing solu-
tion at different points along the column and chemically analyzing the
samples for copper. The results are shown in Fig. 47. The samples were
withdrawn at a rate sufficiently low that the photocell readings did not
change. The dispersion coefficient values were 23.1 em’ /sec and 30.3
en’ /sec for the photocell and the copper analysis data, respectively.
The deviation of the value based on the photocell data from the value

based on copper analysis was less than 8%.

related to cell development were carried out in static cells. The oh-
jectives were: (1) determination of conditions under which a protective
frozen salt film can be maintained on electrode dividers in the presence
of high heat generation in the salt, and (2) identification of a black
material which has formed in the salt during all static-cell experiments
carried out to date. In one experiment, frozen salt films were formed
around the top of a BeO electrode divider located in a repion of high
current density. In the second experiment, lead-acid batteries were
used to provide a constant voltage in order to. determine whether an

ac component in the nominal dec power contributed to the formation of

the black material in the salt.

7.1 Formation of Frozen Salt Films on a BeO Electrode Divider

Because BeQ has several properties that would be useful in con-
structing an electrolytic cell, its use is being explored. An experi-
ment utilizing a BeO electrode divider was carried out in a 4-in.-diam
ouartz cell, which has been described previously.’ The anode for the
experiment consisted of a 2-1/2-in.~diam by 1-1/4~in.~high cup made of
Be. The cup was clad with metal on the inner and. outer surfaces and
had provisions for forming a frozen film of salt around the upper rim
of the cup. During the experiment, the BeO was used as the electrical
insulator between the anode and cathode; it was not exposed to molten
salt. The anode area was 15 cm? before a frozen salt layer was formed

on the rim of the Bel cup.

The bismuth that was used in the experiment was treated with hy-
drogen in a separate mild-steel vessel at 700°C before being transferred
to the cell vessel. The molten salt used in the experiment had the
composition 66~34 mole % LiF-BeF,.
Although the cell was operated for about 25 min, satisfactory

operation was not obtained. Current densities of 2 to 5 AJ en’ (based

on initial anode area) were observed with an applied potential of about
2.1 V.

86

The cell resistance was in the range 0.2 to 0.5 ohm. The op-

erational difficulties that were encountered, and the methods that were

used to correct them during the second experiment carried out in this

type of cell, are discussed below.

1.

The salt in the cell remained transparent only a short time
after its introduction into the cell. There was some indica-
tion that the salt contained HF, which attacked the mild-steel
components of the anode. In the second experiment, the salt
was sparged with hydrogen in a separate vessel prior to being

transferred into the cell.

The anode was too large for the 4-in,-0D quartz cell. The salt
in the small annular space between the anode and the cell wall
froze completely, causing the quartz vessel to break. This
problem was solved in the second experiment by using a 6-in.-

diam quartz cell vessel.

Bismuth droplets clinging to the inner and outer mild-steel
cups caused shorting between the anode and the cathode. In

the second experiment, the outer steel cup was removed.

The frozen salt layer at the coolant outlet was very thin. In
the second experiment, an auxiliary coolant inlet was placed
at the outlet of the cooling ring to provide frozen salt on

the coolant outlet.

At the end of the run, the BeO cup was found to be cracked.

The cracking probably occurred due to freezing of the bismuth
and salt that were trapped between the steel cladding and the
BeO cup. Holes were drilled in the inner. cup for the next ex-
periment to reduce the possibility of material becoming trapped

between the BeO and the steel cup.
87

The cell used in the second experiment was similar to that used in
the first experiment except for incorporation of the changes mentioned
above. The cell used a 2-1/2-in.~0D BeO cup to contain bismuth for the
anode (Fig. 48) and to electrically insulate the anode from the cathode.
The cup was supported by a cooling ring, made of low-carbon steel, that
was located just above the cup and was used to cover its rim with a pro-
tective frozen salt film. Coolant was introduced to the ring and removed
from it through tubes that served as the anode electrical lead. The
anode, which had an initial cross section of about 15 cm”, was placed in
the 6-in.~diam quartz vessel that contained the bismuth cathode pool.

The assembled cell is shown in Fig. 49. The cell was charged with 16 kg
of purified bismuth and 2.4 kg of salt (66-34 mole % LiF-BeF,~ThF,) . The
salt had been sparged with hydrogen at 600°C in a separate treatment ves-
sel to :remove residual dissolved HF. Two successful runs were made in
which a frozen salt film was maintained on the portion of the Be0 cup in

contact with salt. The steps in the operating procedure were as follows.

1. The salt and bismuth temperatures were set between 465 and
470°C. (The liquidus temperature of 66-34 mole 7 LiF-BeF, is
458°C.)

No

With the cooling ring located about 1/4 in. above the normal

cell operating position and completely in the salt phase, the
nitrogen coolant flow was started (see first diagram in Fig.

50) at about 1 scfm. This flow of coolant caused a layer of

frozen salt to form on the cooling ring and on the coolant

inlet and outlet tubes.

3. When frozen salt had completely covered the cocling ring and
inlet and outlet tubes, the BeD cup was lowered to a position
about 1/8 to 1/4 in. below the operating level. This allowed
frozen salt to form on the coolant inlet and outlet tubes and
ensured that they would be completely insulated (see the second

diagram in Fig. 50).

4, During steps 2 and 3, salt was prevented from freezing com-
pletely over the bismuth surface in the anode cup by moving
a 3/8-in.-diam steel rod up and down at the center of the

cup.

5. On completion of step 3, the anode cup was raised slightly
to move any bare metal at the top of the coolant tubes out
of the salt phase (see third diagram in Fig. 50). This
final position allowed the bismuth in the cathode pool to
contact the metal cooling ring in case the frozen salt on
the cooling ring melted. This would cause a short circuit,

an unmistakable indication of removal of the frozen film.

6. Voltage was then applied to the cell, and was increased step-
wise until the desired value was reached. As the cell current

increased, the rate of coolant flow was also increased.

In the first run, nitrogen was used as the coolant at flow rates

of 1 to 6 scfm. In the second run, water was atomized into the nitrogen
stream in order to increase the cooling capacity and to allow operation
for a longer period before exhaustion of the nitrogen supply. The second
run used ac power rather than dc power. In each rum, the current was in-
creased stepwise, allowing steady-state conditions to be attained before
proceeding further. The maximum current densities reached in the first
and second runs were 1.9 Aen? and 2.8 Alem, respectively. Table 4

summarizes the data from these runs.

These experiments indicated that a layer of frozen salt can be main-
tained in the presence of high current densities if sufficient cooling is
provided. It is also necessary for the initial salt and bismuth temp-

eratures to be within about 10°C of the liquidus temperature of the salt.

7.2 Experiment Using Lead-Acid Storage Batteries for Power Supply

The rectifier that is normally used to supply dc power for electrol-
vsis experiments produces current with an appreciable ac ripple due to
incomplete filtering. The ac component has been suspected to cause the
formation of a dark-colored material, which has been repeatedly observed
in the salt in all static-cell experiments to date, since it has been
reported that sols of electrode metals can be produced in molten salts
by use of alternating current. Therefore, an experiment was carried out
to determine whether the dark-colored material would be formed with direct
current having no ac component. The cell used for this experiment was
made from a 4~in.-diam quartz tube and contained a 3-in.~high quartz di-
vider, which separated two hemicylindrical bismuth electrodes having a
surface area of about 30 cn’ each. The cell contained bismuth that had
been purified by hydrogen sparging and molten salt (66-34 mole % LiF-
BeF,) that had been sparged with hydrogen to remove residual HF. The
power supply consisted of five 6-V lead-acid storage batteries, each of

which was rated at 200 A-hr.

The cell was operated initially at 500°C with a current of 3 A.
Dark-colored material, accompanied by some gas evolution, could be seen
rising from the anode surface; within 9 min, the salt became opaque.

The salt cleared up after being allowed to stand overnight. In another
run made at 600°C with a current of 2 A, the salt became opaque within
6 min as a result of material emanating from the anode. Again, the salt

became clear after standing overnight.

Two additional runs were made: one with a cell temperature of (75°C
and a current of 2.8 A, and the other at a cell temperature of 680°C with
currents as high as 45 A. No dark material was formed during these runs.
Another run was attempted at 500°C, but the presence of a large amount of
precipitate in the salt (apparently produced during the previous runs)
obscured visibility to such an extent that we could not tell whether any

of the dark-colored material was formed.
94

The conclusions drawn from this experiment are: (1) ac ripple in
the power supply is not responsible for production of the dark-colored
material, and (2) the dark-colored material may not be formed at high

temperatures. The black-colored material may be BiF, (an anode reaction

3
product), which may react with quartz. At high temperatures, the dark-
colored material is either completely soluble or it is not visible due

to the high rate at which it reacts with quartz.

8. DESIGN AND INSTALLATION OF THE FLOW ELECTROLYTIC CELL FACILITY

J. R. Hightower, Jr. L.. E. McNeese
E. L. Nicholson W. F. Schaffer, Jr.

A facility for continuously circulating molten salt and bismuth
through electrolytic cells at temperatures up to 600°C is being installed
in Bldg. 3541. The equipment associated with this facility will allow us
to test a variety of cell designs under conditions similar to those ex-
pected in processing plants. The equipment consists of a 16-in.-diam
vessel that will contain the cell to be tested, a mixer-settler tank in
which the salt and bismuth streams from the cell will be equilibrated,
gas-lift pumps and orifice--~head pot flowmeters for circulating and
metering the streams to the cell, and a vessel containing a graphite
crucible for purifying the salt and bismuth. Also provided are a gas
supply station for metering HF, hydrogen, argon, and nitrogen; a system
for disposing of unreacted HF; a 750~A dc power supply; and instrumenta-

tion for recording pressures, temperatures, current, and voltage.

A detailed description of this equipment is given in the remainder

of this section.

8.1 Flow Diagram

A flow diagram for the system is shown in Fig. 51. Bismuth and salt

are circulated by gas-lift pumps at nominal flow rates of 0.5 and 0.25 gpm,

respectively. The bismuth flows into the cathode compartment of the
cell, and the salt flows into the region adjacent to the anode and
cathode. After exiting from the cell, the salt and bismuth flow to a
mixer-settler tank, where they are equilibrated in order to reverse
the reaction carried out in the cell. Figures 52 and 53 show the
equipment before thermal insulation was applied, while Fig. 54 shows

it after installation in a walk-in hood in Bldg. 3541.

8.2 Cell Containment Vessel

The cell containment vessel (Fig. 52) is a 16~in.-diam, 21-in.-
high vessel constructed of 1/4~in.-thick stainless steel. The usable
space is 15-1/2 in. in diameter and 16 in. deep. The nominal operating
temperature is 600°C. Two sight glasses, placed 180° apart in the ves-
sel wall, allow visual observation of the cell. Ports in the top flange
allow the cell effluent streams to be sampled. An argon atmosphere is

provided.

8.3 Mixer-Settler Vessel

The mixer-settler vessel (Fig. 55) is a carbon-steel horizontal
tank, 8 in. in diameter with dished heads, and has a total capacity
of about 960 in.3. This vessel is divided into a mixing chamber and
a settling chamber by an internal partition. The mixing chamber con-
tains a motor-driven agitator surrounded by four fixed baffles for
efficient mixing. A hermetically sealed magnetic clutch couples a
variable-speed motor to the tank agitator. The agitator blades and
shaft are constructed of molybdenum. Thermocouple wells and bubbler
tubes for measuring the liquid level are provided; both are made of

molybdenum.

8.4 Gas-Lift Pumps

Tests with mercury have shown that gas lifts are suitable for pump-

15

ing dense liquids at low flow rates. Two gas-1lift tubes (v 0.3 in.

ID) are used in parallel for pumping the bismuth; one tube is used for
pumping salt. The salt pump and the bismuth pump have submergences of

about 587% and about 54% of the lift height, respectively.

8.5 Orifice--Head Pot Flowmeters

The gas-liquid mixtures from the gas-lift pumps discharge into two
Lein,~diam by 7-in.-long carbon-steel disengagement vessels (Fig. 52),
which separate the gas and the liquid phases as well as damp surges in
the liquid flow rate to the cell vessel. Each vessel (shown schematically
in Fig. 56 and in detail in Fig. 57) is divided into two concentric com-
partments. The outer compartment contains baffles for separating the gas
and liquid phases; the inner compartment is designed to produce a pool of
quiescent liquid over the orifice through which the liquid discharges.

The depth of liquid above the orifice is measured to provide an indication
of liquid flow rate. The orifice is located in a plate attached to a
spring-loaded cartridge. This plate can be removed if an orifice of a
different size is desired. Calibration of orifices in a head pot of this

design is discussed in Sect. 9.

8.6 Salt~Metal Treatment Vessel

The salt and the bismuth used in the system must be purified by
sparging with HF and hydrogen prior to introduction to the system,as
well as periodically during the experimental program. Such treatment
removes oxide impurities and reduces corrosion product fluorides to
the corresponding metals, which can be removed by filtration. The
treatment vessel is a 16~in.-0OD by 17-1/2-in.~high vessel constructed
of 1/4-in.-thick 304 type stainless steel. It contains a graphite
crucible for protection against corrosion. Thermowells, sparge lines,
a transfer line, and bubbler tubes made of molybdenum are provided.
The transfer line from the treatment vessel contains a filter that con-
sists of a 4~in.~diam by 1/8-in.-thick porous molybdenum digk having a

mean pore diameter of about 30 yu.

8.7 Electrolytic Cell

A portion of the first electrolytic cell to be tested is shown in
Fig. 58. The vessel, which will contain both the bismuth cathode pool
and the electrolyte pool, is fabricated of sections of 5-in. and 8-in.
sched 40 carbon-steel pipe. The inlet reservoirs for the bismuth and
the salt streams, made of 1-in. sched 40 pipe, are connected to the
main cell vessel by l-in.-long sections of 3/4-in. tubing. The salt
and the metal levels are set by the height of a vented 1/2-in.-diam

overflow line for each stream.

Preliminary tests with a Lucite model of the vessel (Fig. 59) were
made with mercury and water. An air-1ift pump was used to circulate
mercury through the cell vessel at flow rates up to 0.35 gpm (slightly
below the nominal bismuth flow rate). Gas disengagement and mercury
flow measurement were effected by a Lucite model of the orifice--head
pots described earlier. In general, the Lucite model performed satis-
factorily with water flow rates up to 0.25 gpm. These tests resulted
in the following observations, and the indicated changes were incor-

porated in the design of the vessel shown in Fig. 58.

1. The small amount of splashing in the metal inlet reservoir
could be contained easily with a loose-fitting splash shield
at the top of the inlet reservoir. In the actual vessel,
splashing at the overflow lines will be prevented by ter-
minating the end of the overflow line below the level of

liquid in the overflow stream sampling reservoir.

2, Frictional losses in the 1/2-in. inlet lines and 3/8-in.

8.8 Power Supply

The dc power supply has an output of 0 to 24 V, a maximum current
of 750 A, and a 4.2% rms ac component. The unit, which can be controlled
remotely, has provisions for automatic voltage control as well as auto-
matic current control. (Or, if desired, it can be controlled manually.)
The automatic voltage control will maintain constant voltage within + 27%
in the 0- to 24-V range; the automatic current control will maintain

constant current within + 2% in the range 75 to 750 A.

8.9 Status of Equipment

Except for the power supply, all of the equipment for the Flow
Electrolytic Cell Facility has been installed. The power supply has
been received. All of the electrical work associated with thermocouples

and heater power supplies has been completed.

9. CALIBRATION OF AN ORIFICE--HEAD POT FLOWMETER
WITH MOLTEN SALT AND BISMUTH

C. W. Kee B. A. Hannaford

The Flow Electrolytic Cell Facility (FECF) discussed in Sect. 8
contains orifice——head pot flowmeters for measuring the rates at which
salt and bismuth flow through the test cell. Calibration and study of
these units, which are of a nonstandard design (Sect. 8.5), are being
carried out prior to operation of the FECF to ensure that uncertainties

in flow rates will be acceptably small.

The initial tests were carried out with transient flows of both
water and mercury through a Lucite model. Subsequently, tests were
carried out with both transient and steady flows of salt and bismuth
in a metal orifice--head pot flowmeter. Details of the tests and the

data that were obtained are discussed in the remainder of this section.
108

9.1 Mathematical Analysis

Flow through a standard sharp-edged orifice can be predicted from

the relation

Qp = Cq A ~:2pAP, (24)

where Q = flow rate of the liquid,
p = density of the liquid,
A = cross-sectional area of the orifice,
AP = pressure drop across the orifice,
C4 = orifice coefficient.

The objectives of the present studies are twofold: (1) to verify the
applicability of this relation to the orifice--head pot flowmeters, and
(2) to determine the orifice coefficient. The orifice coefficient can

be calculated directly from Eq. (24) by using data obtained during steady
flow, or from a more convenient relation that was derived for use with

transient flow.

In the transient flow tests, the head pot was first filled with
molten salt or bismuth to the desired level. Then the fluid was allowed
to drain from it, and the liquid level was determined several times during
the drainage period. Since the head pot is of constant cross section, the
discharge rate is related to changes in the liquid level in the head pot
during the drainage period as follows:

df

Q = dt Ars (25)

where Q = liquid discharge rate,
£ = liquid level above orifice,
t = time,
A, = cross-sectional area of head pot.
109

The pressure drop across the orifice is related to the liquid level as

follows:
P= Log,

where g = gravitational constant.

Thus, Eq. (25) can be written as

Sh asp (26)

Q=- pg dt

Combining Eqs. (24) and (26) yields

dAP d 20
= dt. (27)
“AP Ay

bP = (AP) 1iea1 2 E50
is

Thus, a plot of VAP vs t should yield a straight line having a slope of

9.2 Data Obtained from Transient Flow in a Lucite
Orifice~~-Head Pot Flowmeter

During the initial experiments with water in the Lucite head pot,
it was observed that the orifice drain chamber became filled with water
when the level in the head pot was greater than about 0.5 in. A sub-
merged orifice is undesirable for this orifice--head pot design since
the pressure downstream of the orifice will not be known unless the
downstream chamber is filled with gas. This problem was solved by
enlarging the orifice drain chamber and conducting all subsequent ex-

periments with an unsubmerged orifice.

The times required for the head-pot level to reach certain pre-
determined points were measured in ten runs with water and three runs
with mercury. The measured values were averaged for each head-pot
level; the resulting data for water and mercury are shown in Figs. 60

and 61, respectively.

Over most of the range of flow rates studied, constant orifice
coefficients were observed with both water and mercury. As expected,
a decrease in orifice coefficient occurred at low flow rates. However,
one would not normally operate in this region, since significant errors
in pressure drop could result from uncertainties in the differential
pressure transmitter zero and in the distance between the orifice and

the bubbler tube used for measuring the upstream pressure.

9.3 Data Obtained from Transient Flow in a Metal
Orifice~--Head Pot Flowmeter

Four experiments were run in which the drainage of molten salt or
bismuth from a mild-steel head pot was observed. The data obtained with
bismuth (Figs. 62 and 63) indicate a constant orifice coefficient having
a value of 0.646, which is approximately equal to the orifice coefficient
obtained with mercury (0.663). Deviation of the points from the line in
the early part of the experiment (see Fig. 63) results from the fact that

bismuth was still flowing into the head pot during this period.

The data obtained with salt (Figs. 64 and 65) also show a constant
orifice coefficient. The value of this coefficient (0.402) is lower than
that obtained with water (0.709) and reflects the higher viscosity of

the molten salt.

9.4 Data Obtained from Steady Flow of Bismuth in a Metal
Orifice~~Head Pot Flowmeter

Three calibration experiments were made in which a steady flow of
bismuth was maintained through the mild-steel head pot. Orifice coeffi-
cients calculated from data obtained during four periods of constant
pressure drop across the 0.118-~in.~diam orifice are given in Table 5.
Although the orifice coefficient values agree favorably with the average
value obtained with transient flow (0.646), additional data are needed
to reduce the level of uncertainty in the value of the orifice coeffi-
cient. The orifice was removed periodically for inspection during these

experiments. No evidence of corrosion, plugging, or deposition was noted.

the vicinity of the interface. A modified version of a liquid-level
induction probe developed at Argonne National Laboratory” has been

built, and a study of this probe is presently under way.

10.1 Inductance Coil

The inductance coil, shown in Fig. 66, consists of a 12-in.-long
bifilar winding of 30-gage platinum wire. The platinum wire is wound
in grooves, which have been machined into the surface of a tubular
lavite form having an outside diameter of 15/16 in. and an inside
diameter of 9/16 in. These grooves are 0,015 in. wide, 0.015 in. deep
with a round bottom, and are separated by 0.035 in. of lavite. The coil
contains ten turns per inch. Protective collars, 1 in. wide by 1-7/16 in.
in diameter, are located at each end of the coil. The coil leads are
twisted pairs to ensure minimal connecting lead inductance. The entire
assembly has been coated with a ceramic glaze to reduce the possibility

of external shorting of the coils.

10.2 Electronics System

The input to the primary coil is supplied by a Wavetek Function
Generator Model 120" and is typically 20 kc at 2 V. The output of the
secondary coil is amplified to about 6 V, rectified, and filtered. The
residual current is suppressed to eliminate the zero-level signal, and
the differential voltage (e.g., 10 mV dc) is amplified and fed to a
strip-chart recorder. When the electronics for this system have been
tested under conditions similar to those which will be encountered in

actual practice, the wiring diagram will be finalized and reported.

10.3 Auxiliary Equipment

A liquid bismuth reservoir has been designed and will be fabricated
from carbon steel. Capabilities for in situ purification of the bismuth
and for control of temperature, pressure, and cover gas have been provided.
The interface detector will be mounted for testing on a seamless type
316 stainless steel tube having a 0.065-in. wall and an outside diameter
of 0.500 in. The portion of the inside length of the tube that will be
in contact with liquid bismuth is being coated with a 0.005-in. layer of
tungsten. Similarly, the portion of the outside diameter of the tube
that will be located inside the liquid bismuth reservoir will be coated
with a 0.005-in. layer of tungsten to preclude the possibility of a

reaction taking place between the bismuth and the stainless steel.

11. STRIPPING OF ThF, FROM MOLTEN SALT BY REDUCTIVE EXTRACTION

L. E. McNeese C. P. Tung

Efficient operation of the reductive extraction system for rare-

earth removal requires’® that only a negligible quantity of ThF, remain

in the salt which passes through the electrolytic cell and returns to
the bottom of the extraction column. It has been proposed that this low

ThF, concentration be maintained by stripping the ThF, from salt that is

4
fed to the cell by countercurrent contact with a lithium-bismuth stream

produced at the cell cathode. We have made calculations showing the

extent to which ThF, can be removed from the salt with a column containing

4
one to four theoretical stages. It was assumed that the salt entering the

stripping column had the composition 72-16-12 mole Z% LiF-BeF,-ThF and

that the metal entering the column consisted of a lithium-bismuth mixture
having a lithium concentration of 0.008 mole fraction. The metal-to-salt

molar flow rate ratio, based on the feed streams, was 74.6.

The fraction of the ThF, remaining in the salt stream that left the

column is shown in Fig. 67 as a function of the number of theoretical

stages used. With one theoretical stage, the fraction of ThF, remaining

in the salt stream is approximately 0.12; the fractions for two, three,
and four stages are 0.013, 0.96 x 107%, and 2.16 x 1077, respectively.
Since the required fractional Th¥, removal is about 0.99, two to three
theoretical stages will be sufficient to maintain the desired fractional

removal of ThF, .
