ABSTRACT

Five preliminary critical assemblies, planned in conjunction with

a full scale aircraft type circulating fuel reactor, were constructed
at the Oak Ridge Critical Experiment Facility The first assembly

was constructed with a beryllium island and reflector, and had enriched
uranium disks placed between sodium filled stainless steel cans arranged
in a fuel annulus The assembly was critical with 15 1 kg of U-235

The second assembly was also constructed with a beryllium island and
reflector, however, a powdered mixture of sodium, zirconium and
uranium fluorides packed in aluminum tubes was used as a fuel, and
fuel end ducts were provided The assembly was critical wath 7 7 kg

of U-235 The addition of structural poisons (fifth assembly) to this
assembly increased the critical mass to 18 2 kg of U-235 In the

third assembly the beryllium island and reflector were replaced by
graphite With 17 3 kg of U-235 in the fuel region, this assembly was
not critical In order to make the assembly critical approximately
80% of the graphite in the island and inner six inches of the reflector
were replaced by beryllium The fourth assembly was constructed as

a two region assembly with a 1 to 1 volume ratio of graphite and
powdered fuel in the core and a beryllium reflector This assembly
was critical with 15 2 kg of U-235

Neutron flux distributions were determined in these assemblies
using indium foil activation Power distributions were determined
using aluminum catcher foils in contact with uranium fuel disks

Measurements were made on the effect on reactivity of placing various
materials in the fuel and reflector regions, and an estimate of the
neutron leaksge was obtalned for two of the assemblies

I INTRODUCTION

The Reflector Moderated Reactor (RMR) as presently conceived is a

high power, high temperature, circulating fuel reactor, which is
characterized by a central beryllium island surrounded by a wranium
bearing fluoride fuel annulus and a beryllium reflector’ Fave

critical assemblies have been constructed in which the essential

features of the RMR were mocked-up The series of experiments, which
were carried out at room tempersture and essentially zero power; provide
experimental data on the critical mass and neutron flux and power distri-
butions that cen be compared to those predicted by multigroup calculation
for the assembly in question In addition, danger coefficients were
obtained for a large number of materials placed at various points in the
reactors

The first assembly (CA-10) consisted essentially of a central 12" cube
of beryllium partially surrounded by a 3" fuel annulus and a 12" thick
beryllium reflector backed by graphite The fuel annulus contained
sodium filled stainless steel cans between which were placed 0 Ol" thick
uranium disks The majority of the measurements were teken with 15 1 kg
of U-235 in the reactor, which provided an excess reactivity of 1 9% in

Kopp

The second assembly (CA-11) differed from the first in that, 1) the
fuel region contained an homogeneous mixture of ZrOp, NaF, C, and UF
packed 1n aluminum tubes, 2) the thickness of the fuel annulus was
increased to 4-1/2", and end fuel ducts were provided, 3) the central
island region was arranged essentially as a 9" cube, and 4) the regions
were assembled to approximate concentric spheres somewhat more closely
This assembly was critical with 7 7 kg of U=235

1
The third assembly (CA-12) was originally designed to evaluate the
characteristics of a graphite moderated and reflected assembly The
fuel region was built up as a cylindrical shell 21" OD, 3" thick and
36" long The fuel used was similar to that used in CA-11 with the
U=-235 concentration approximately doubled This array was not critical
Approximately 80% of the graphite in the island and the immer 6" of the
reflector was then replaced by beryllium in order to make the reactor
critical The fuel region contained 17 3 kg of U-235 In the second
modification of this reactor, the 17 3 kg of fuel were rearranged as an
ellipsoid with the beryllium and graphite surrounding the central fuel
region This two region reactor was not critical

1 Fraas, A P and Mills, C B , "The Fireball, A Reflector Moderated
Circulating - Fuel Reactor" Y-F10-10k, June 20, 1952
The fourth assembly (CA-13) was composed of a central ellipsoid
containing a 1 to 1 volume ratio of graphite and the fuel used in
CA-12 This core was surrounded by a beryllium reflector 12" thick
The reactor was critical with 15 2 kg of U-235

The last assembly (CA-14) was similar to CA-1l except that the fuel
with the higher uranium concentration was used and an effort was made
to simulate the poisons (core shells, coolants, coolant tubes, etc )
that will be present in a full scale reactor It was critical with
18 2 kg of U-235

ITI DESCRIPTION OF ASSEMBLY AND MATERIALS

The critical experiment assembly has been described in other reports,
and only a brief description of the components that are necessary for
an understanding of the physical make up of the reactors will be
given

The assembly apparatus consists basically of a matrix of square 2S
aluminum tubes, which form a 6' cube and into which may be placed the
reactor materials ‘The 6' cube 1s divided into two identical halves,
one of which is stationary and the other moveable by remote control
Each half consists of 576 tubes, stacked in a 24 x 24 cell array

These tubes are 36" in length with a 3" x 3" outside cross-section

and have O O47" thick walls Part of the reactor materials are

placed in each half and the assembly made critical by control rod
adjustment after the two halves have been brought together A
reference system 1s used to designate each cell A letter desig-
nation is given each column of cells and a number for each row This
system 1s evident from any of the loading diagrams The assembly, with
the two halves separated, can be seen in Fig II-1 (The materials
visible in the upper portion of the movable half have no relation to the
subject experiments )

The basic materials present in the reactors beside the fuel and aluminum
matrix were beryllium and graphite These materials were in the form of
square blocks, either 2-7/8" x 2-7/8" or 1-7/16" x 1-7/16" and of
various thicknesses Each block had a 0 196" hole drilled through its
center, normal to the square cross-section When required, ,a skewer rod
was inserted through these holes to form a "shish-kabob” The skewer
rods had a 3/16" dlameter and were composed of aluminum except for those
"shishes"” used as safety or control rods in which case a steel skewer
was used All safety and control rods were normal reflector or island
shishes

mh eh¥iched (9% 54 U-235) uranium metal disks used were approximately
0 Ol" thick with diameters of 2 860" and 1 430" and weighed 18 0 + 0 1
and 4 5 + 0 1 grams respectively The weight tolerance was obtained by
punching small holes in some of the disks Each disk had a O 196" hole
drilled through the center The powdered fuel mixtures are described
under the appropriate reactor designation

The appendix contains quantitative information on the materials
located in each region of all the assemblies, and also spectrographic
analyses of some of the materials used

IIT CA-10

A Assembly Loading

The initiel loading for CA-10 1s shown in Figs III=1 and III-2,
which are cross-sections of the assembly at the mid-plane of the
reactor and the vertical plane containing the central axis of the
reactor, respectively It is seen that the assembly consists of a
12" central cube of beryllium, partially surrounded by a 3" fuel
annulus composed of sodium filled stainless steel cans (2-7/8" x
2-T/8" x 1") between which were placed the large sized O OL" thick
uranium disks The components and arrangement of a typical fuel
shish are shown in Fig III-3 As can be noted from Fig III-2,

a section 6" square at both ends of the fuel annulus was filled
with beryllium rather than the uranium disks and sodium The

fuel region was loaded with two fuel disks between each sodium
filled can except for the 3" end fuel regions behind the central
beryllium cube, which had only ome disk between each can The
fuel annulus was surrounded by a 12" thick beryllium reflector
backed by 6" of graphite on the sides and 8" on the ends of the
reactor

With the loading described above the reactor contained 15 O kg

of U=-235 which at a room temperature of T4Or provided an excess
reactivity of 1 9% in k pe The reactor was made g¢ritical

by removing the reflector from cells J-13 and 14 and I-13 (1 6%)
and by adjustment of the control rods Measurements that required
more reactivity than was available on the control rods were
accomplished by imserting one or more reflector shishes in the
above cells All foil and danger coefficient measurements were
taken on the opposite side of the reactdr where the effect of the
volds on the measurements was negligible

B Control Rod Calibrations

The change in reactivity introduced by the linear displacement
of each of three control rods was determined Rod D was cali-

Temperature Effects

The changes in reactivity produced by changes in temperature

over a limited range were determined by changing the demand
temperature of the assembly room Several days were allowed

for the reactor temperature to reach equilibrium The reactor

was made critical before and after the temperature changes,

and the reactivity differences determined in terms of the
calibrated control rod settings The temperature of the reactor
was determined from two iron-constanteh thermocouples Figure III-6
shows the reactivity changes plotted as a function of the assembly
temperature A systematic study was not undertaken to determine
the sources of this temperature effect, it was determined primarily
to correct all reactivity measurements to a common reactor
temperature

Neutron Flux and Power Distribution

Neutron flux distributions were obtained using bare and cadmium
covered indium foils The techniques used for these measurements
have been adequately covered in previous reports and will not be
repeated here Power distributions were obtained using the
aluminum catcher foil technique which is also described in the
same reference

1 Flux Distributions

Bare and cadmium covered indium traverses were made through
the fuel core, starting at the mid-plane and extending to the
edge of the graphite reflector and parallel to the axis of

the reactor through cell Q-13 Table III-3 contains data
showing the positions of the bare and cadmium covered foils
and their relative activities Figure III-7 shows the relative
activities plotted as a function of the distances of the foils
from the mid-plane

Bare and cadmium covered indium traverses were also made
through the beryllium island parallel to the axis of the
reactor, starting at the mid-plane and extending to the edge
of the graphite reflector, through cell 0-12 and P-12 The
traverses made through cell P-12 pass through the fuel core
while those through 0-12 do not Table III-4 contains data
showing the distances of the foils from the mid-plane in the
respective cells and also the relative activity obtained for
each foil Figures IIT-8 and III-9 show the graph of the

2 Power Distributions

The power distribution through the fuel was measured along the
axis of cell Q-13 The aluminum catchers were mounted vertically
between the uranium fuel disks and the adjacent sodium cans

Table III-T contains dats showing the distances of the aluminum
foils from the mid-plane of the reactor Figure III-12 is a graph
of the relative fission rates plotted as a function of the distance
from the mid-plane The two values shown at 9 5" from the axis
indicate different fission rates on the opposite surfaces of the
uranium disks which are adjacent to the sodium cans and the
beryllium, the higher fission rate occuring on the surface adjacent
to the beryllium

thick fuel disks separated by cstcher foils thereby forming a
sandwich This sandwich was inserted in the normal fuel position
between two sodimm filled cans The data obtained are shown in
Table III-9 and Figure III-1l Two catcher foils were inserted

Effect of Stainless Steel on Power Distribution

 

In order to determine the effect of a stainless steel core
shell on the power distribution across the fuel, the beryllium
reflector in cells R=10 through R-15 was rearranged so that a
void (5/8" x 2-7/8" x 9") existed adjacent to the fuel annulus
extending on one side of the mid-plane only A 3" longitudinal
-26-

section in fuel cell Q-=13 was rotated 90° about a vertical
axis from its normally loaded position The sodium filled
cens were replaced by aluminum spacers sud some of the O ol"
fuel disks replaced by O 002" disks A radial power distri-
bution was then measured in this 3" section Stainless
steel sheets (9" x 2-7/8" x 0 29") were then inserted in the
voids in cells R-10 through R-15, and the power distribution
remeasured The data obtained from both traverses are shown
in Table III-11l and Figure III-15

E Danger Coefficient Measurements
1 Stainless Steel

The loss in reactivity due to the presence of stainless steel
next to the fuel annulus was determined for three different
steel thicknesses inserted* in the void in cells R=10 through
R-15 described above The void itself resulted in a loss in
reactivity of 8 7 cents The loss in reactivity as a function
of the stainless steel thickness is plotted in Figure III-16

2 Bismuth and Iead

A 1-1/8" layer of beryllium adjacent to the fuel surface and
extending 8-5/8" on both sides of the mid-plane was removed
from cells R=10 through R=15 The introduction of this void

 

* The fuel region extended slightly beyond the steel inserts so the
fuel disks adjacent to the beryllium were not fully shielded

resulted in a loss in reactivity of 92 cents Six pleces of
bismuth (2-7/8" x 2-7/8" x 1") were then placed in each of
these cells to partially fill the void The additional loss
in reactivity due to the bismuth was 32 cents The bismuth
was then removed and replaced by lead, with a resulting loss
in reactivity of 121 cents

Stainless Steel and Sodium

 

Four stainless steel cans filled with sodium were removed
from cell Q-13 Four aluminum spacers; each approximately
1/4" x 1-7/16" x 1-7/16", were substituted for each of the
sodium filled cans to anchor the fuel disks in place The
change in reactivity due to substituting the aluminum spacers
for the cans was determined The aluminum spacers were then
replaced by four empty stainless steel cans similar to those
containing the sodium: thus the change in reactivity due to
the removal of the sodium alone was obtained A gain in
reactivity of 8 4 cents was obtained by substitution of

the aluminum spacers for the sodium filled cans, and a gain
of 2 8 cents was realized by the removal of only the sodium

Assembly Loading

The fuel region of the second assembly (CA-11) had properties
that more nearly simulated those of the conceived full scale
RMR The fuel used was an homogeneous mixture of Zr0Oz, NaF,
C, UFy, and a small amount of adsorbed moisture The wranium
wes enriched to 93 2% U-235 The composition of the mixture
was

16 2 wt $ UF)
55 0 wt % 2r0g
19 9 wt % NaF
88wt gC

0 25 wt % Hp0

The wranium density was O 21 gm U-235/cc and the average packed
density of the mixture was 1 8 gn/cc ZrOo was used in place of
Zr¥), with the carbon added to compensate for the difference in the
thermal neutron scattering properties of the mixture The
powdered mixture was packed in 1-1/4" 0 D square aluminum tubes
-30-

with a 1/16" wall thickness These fuel tubes were arranged in an
annulus around a beryllium island with a beryllium and graphite
reflector swrounding the fuel Figures IV-1 and IV-2 show the
loading at the mid-plane and in the vertical plane containing the
reactor axis, respectively Inasmuch as there were no fuel tubes
4-1/2" long available, 4-1/2" shishes were made using O Ol" quarter
size fuel disks and aluminum spacers These shishes are shown as
vertical lines in Fig IV-2 The fuel annulus was 4-1/2" thick in
the central region with end ducts that were one fuel ‘tube thick
It should be noted that while the thickness of the fuel region has
been reported as 4-1/2", there were three fuel tubes (3-3/4" total
thickness) across this dimension In general the fuel tubes were
arrenged such that as small a void as possible existed between the
fuel tubes themselves Fig IV-3 shows the arrangement of the
fuel tubes The assembly was critical with 7 7 kg of U-235 In
order to gain the additional reactivity required for some of the
measurements, 0.01" thick full size fuel disks were added to the
island and/or fuel region as required

Evaluation of Control Red D

Control Rod D was evaluated by subdividing the rod into wits of
equal reactivity The evaluation was accomplished by means of the
following procedure The reactor was initially made critical with
Rod A all of the way in, Rod D all the way out, and Rod C appropri-
ately located Rod A was then withdrawn one inch and the reactor
returned to the critical condition by inserting Rod D Rod A was
then inserted one inch and the reactor returned to the previous
critical condition by withdrawing Rod ¢ This sequence of operations
was continued until Rod D was completely inserted By this means Rod
D was divided into increments of equal reactivity over its entire
length The unit of reactivity was determined from the measurement
of the displacement of Rod D equivalent in reactivity to the remowal
of a safety rod, which had been evaluated previously by the "Rod
Drop Method" The data thus obtained for the calibration of Rod D
are shown in Table IV-1 and Fig IV-4. The position of the rod

is measured from the assembly interface

Neutron Flux Distribution

Two radial flux traverses were taken, the first in the mid-plane
of the reactor and the second 6-1/4" from the midplame. The
second traverse passed through the quarter size fuel shishes used
instead of the fuel tubes Tables IV-2 and IV-3 and Figs IV-5
and IV-6 show all the data obtained fer both the bare and cadmium
covered indium traverses

The associated radial cadmium fractions for indium obtained in the
mid-plane from CA-10 and CA-ll are shown in Figure IV=T.

D Power Distributions

Power distributions were obtained by placing 0 002" thick quarter
size uranium disks with slumimum catcher foils adjacent to fuel
tubes in the desired location. The first was measured parallel
to the reactor axis in cell N-1i The 0.002" thick uranium disks
and associated catcher folls were placed adjacent to the fuel
tube between the fuel tubes and the heryllium island. A second
power distribution was taken in the same location with Boral¥
strips (9" x 2-7/8" x 1/4") placed around the end fuel ducts an
the stationary table, replacing some beryllium and graphite as
shown in Figure IV~8 The dsta have been arbitrarily normelized
at a point 14 5" from the interface In order to maintain the
reactor critical with the Boral inserted, additional 0.01" fuel
disks were added to the beryllium island on the movable teble

The data obtained from both runs is shown in Table IV-4 end
Figure IV-9

% The Boral was prepared fram a mixture of 35 wt % BE and alumimm.

E Neutron leakage Measurements

Measurements were obtained in an effort to estimate the ratio of
the end to side neutron leakage from the reactor In the first
set of measurements six bare and cadmium covered indium foils
were placed on the back surface of the reactor extending from
the reactor axis outward T" Three sets of foils were placed on
the outer surface of the graphite side reflector at the mid-plane
These foil measurements were taken without any Boral around the
fuel end ducts

Side and end fast neutron leakage measurements were also cbtained
using a fast fission chamber Measurements were taken both with
and without Boral around the fuel end ducts, and with a 1/4" of
Boral around the fission chanmber¥*. Side leakage was determined

by placing the chamber in cell X-12 with the center of the chsmber
at the mid-plane The axils of the fission chamber was approximately
1-1/2" from the graphite side reflector The end leakage was
obtained by placing the chamber approximately 7" behind the station-
ary table with its axis parallel to the mid-plane with the center

of the chamber on the projected axis of the reactor The data
obtained are sumerized in Table IV-6

which was 10" long, thus approximately 4" of Boral extended beyond
either end.

F Evaluation of Boral around Fuel End Ducts

The Boral streets that were placed around the fuel end ducts as
shown in Figure IV-7 were evaluated The gain in reactivity due
to their removal was compensated for by removing fuel disks from
+he 1sland region on the movable table The loss in reactivity
due to the replacement of beryllium and graphite by Boral around
the fuel end ducts amounted to 1 6% in kos

G Stainless Steel and Boron Poison Rods

 

Two 3/16" diameter rods were evaluated in the center of cell
0-12 in the island The first rod was a stainless steel tube

40" long filled with natural boron to a linear density of O 1 gm
B/in The second was a stainless steel rod 38' long The loss
in reactivity in cents for each rod 1s shown as a function of the
distance of the end of the rod from the mid-plane in Table IV-T
and Figure IV-1ll

H Cadmium Importance Function

 

The importance of cadmium as a neutron absorber when placed in the
mid-plane of the reactor was obtained by taping a piece of cadmium
2-3/4" square and O 02" thick weighing 19 09 gm, to either s block
of beryllium or a fuel tube, and recording the loss in reactivity
for each radial position The data obtained are shown in Tsble
IV-8 and Figure IV-12

 

*Further insertion of the Boron filled rod from the mid-plane to the
assembly interface (9") resulted in an additional reactivity loss of
30 2 cents

Danger Coefficients

Danger coefficlents were obtained for a number of different materials
in the reflector and/or fuel regions. Samples were located in cells
Q=12 and Q-13 in the fuel region or adjacent to the inner face of
cells S-12 and S-13% after removal of some beryllium reflector All
samples were placed symmetrically szbout the mid-plane The changes
in reactivity, either plus or minus, obtained are shown in Table IV-O
and are referenced to the veld The samples of Li, KF, NaF, Zr Cr,
and RbF were placed In alumanum containers (5/16" x 2-1/2" x 9") wath
1/32" well thickness, It las been assumed that these containers had no
significant effect on the reactivity. The sample of sodium was
contained in thin walled stainless steel cans, whose reactivity

value was measured with the cans empty, thus enabling the reporting
of the sodium value. The other samples required no containers The
reactivity changes obtained for these materials are shown in Table
IV-D.

The reactivity chiemge due to the substitution of a sample of DyO for
beryllium was measured at three locations in the assembly The
sample was 99.2% D0 and weighed 2 65 kg. It was placed at the
assembly mid-plane in the island adjacent to the fuel, in the
reflector adjacent to the fuel and in the reflector 3" from the fuel
layer In each of the first two locations the gain in reactivity
due to the substitution was 12 cents, in the latter position the
reactivity was decreased by 24 cents

Effect of Stainless Steel Around the Fuel Annuius
In order to estimate the effect an reactivity of the fuel comtaining

core shells required in the full scale reactor; two adjacent
quadrants of the fuel annulus Were partially covered with stainless

steel 0 145" thick The exposed surfaces of the fuel tubes,
extending 4-1/2" on either side of the mid-plane, both between
the fuel and the island and between the fuel and the reflector,

were covered with 9" long plates The total weight of the steel

added was 9 O kg The additional reactivity required was pro-
vided by adding O 01" thick fuel disks distributed throughout
the fuel region The addition of this steel to the quadrant
first covered resulted in a loss in reactivity of 1 L5%¥* in kK pe
and requiring the addition of 828 gms of wranium to remake the
system critical The steel added to the second quadrant also
resulted in a loss of 1 45%* in k,pee and required the addition
of 1818 gms of wranium

 

*The effect on the control rod calibrations due to the steel and

increased fuel loading were not measured, and therefore introduces

some doubt as to the accuracy of these data

V = CA-l2

In this assembly three variations of the essential features of the
RMR were carried out

1 The reactor was first built up with an all graphite island
and reflector with a 3" thick 18" long cylindrical fuel
annulus separating the two regions The fuel region con-
tained 1 5' thick 9" long end fuel ducts on both ends of the
reactor The loading 1s shown in Figure V-~1 The fuel loaded
in the 1 25" square aluminum tubes, was the same as that used in
CA-11 except the ®w235 density was doubled resulting in the
following composition

32 4 wt % UF)
Wy 2 wt % ZrOg
16 0 wt % NaF
T1lwt%C

0 2 wt % Hp0

The U-235 density was O 42 gm/cm?, and the mixture was packed
to an average density of 1 8 gm/em3., This reactor loaded with
17 3 kg of U-235 was not critical and an apparent source neutron
multiplication of about six was recorded

2 In order to go critical, the assembly was modified by replacing
graphite with beryllium in 31 cells of the assembly Thirteen
of these cells were in the island and the remaining 18 were
around the periphery of the fuel annulus

The substitution of beryllium for graphite in the inner reflector
region was then completed as 1s shown in Figure V-2 The excess
reactivity gained by this further substitution was absorbed by
adding 18 1 kg stainless steel in the form of core shells 0 059"
thick around the fuel annulus and covering the central 18" fuel
region A radial flux distribution was measured in the mid-plane
of the reactor with the assembly loaded as shown in Figure V-2
The data obtained are shown in Table V-1 and Figure V-3 The
cadmium fraction obtained from the two flux curves 1s also shown
in the figure

3 The final variation of CA-12 was a brief exploration of & two
region reactor using 17 3 kg of U-235 wath the fuel arranged in
a central region The fuel was surrounded by a 3" thick
beryllium and thick graphite reflector For this configuration
an apparent source neutron multiplication of about four was
recorded By altering the reflector to provide a 9" layer of

A Assembly Loading

Graphite has bean suggested as a high temperature fluoride container
for the fissioning volume of the RMR CA-13 was assembled to obtain
a check on some of the characteristics of such a reactor A two
region reactor was constructed with a 1/1 graphite to powdered fuel
volume ratio in the central core and surrounded by a 12" beryllium
and 6" graphite reflector as shown in Figure VI-1l The powdered
fuel of CA-12 was used, and the reactor was first critical with

15 2 kg U-235 As additional fuel was added to obtain ‘the configu-
ration shown in Figure VI-l, stainless steel plates 0 059" thick
were added around the fuel to take up the excess reactivity The
reactor contained 17 2 kg of U-235 and 11 O kg of stainless steel
when loaded as shown in the figure The core shell covered 9u%

of the central fuel region (that is, 9" on either side of the md-
plane) which contained 68% of the fuel

B Neutron Flux Distribution

 

With the stainless steel core shell in place, radial bare and
cadmium covered indium traverses were taken in mid-plane of the
reactor extending from M-12 to W-12 The data are shown in Table

Critical Loadings

The final assembly was built up with a geometry similar to that
used in CA-11l The aim of the experiment was to insert materials
in the reactor that would simulate the structural poisons that
would be present in a full scale reactor in the power range of

50 to 200 megawatts The assembly was loaded as shown in Figures
VII-1 and VII-2 and contained 18 2 kg of U-235 in the 0.42 gn
U-235/cc fuel mixture described in Section V In general the
reactor was maintained critical with two different sets of poisons
The first set of poisons included

1 Boral sheets (9" x 2-7/8" x 1/4") which surrounded the fuel end
ducts on the stationary table Thais Boral extended from the end
of the assembly to a point 9" from the central fuel region, thus
4-1/2" of the end ducts were covered Boral sheets (1-1/4" x
2-7/8" x 1/4") were placed around the fuel end ducts on the
movable table These sheets extended from the end of the fuel
ducts to a point 7-3/4" from the central fuel region

2 Stainless steel sheets (0 146" thick) covered 96% of the inside
fuel surface The outside fuel surface was uncovered from the
interface of the assembly back 4-1/2" on the stationary teble
The fuel surface exposed at the assembly interface and the
corresponding surface at the opposite end of the central fuel

3 Nickel sheets 2-7/8" wide and 0 01¥ thick were in the
positions indicated in Figures VII=-2 ahd VII-3

In addition to the above poisons, 177 nd of beryllium were added
to the fuel region Of thas total, 150 ind were distributed
symmetrically throughout the outer three fuel layers frog 0 to 18
inches back on the stationary table An additional 6 in” were
distributed symmetrically throughout the inner 4-1/2" long fuel
layer adjacent to the assembly interface on the stationary table
The remaining 2k ind of beryllium were symmetrically distributed
throughout the fuel region on the moveable table

During this series of experiments reactivity values were obtained
for one sheet of nickel (24" x 2-7/8" x 0 010") placed in a
horizontal position across the top of cell K-12, and for the
extension of the reflector from 9" to 32" of beryllium on the
sides of the reactor The insertion of the nickel sheet resulted
in a loss in reactivity of 8 cents The replacement of graphite
by beryllium in cells G-10 through 15 and cells V-10 through 15
and the addition of graphite to cells E-10 through 15 and X-10
through 15 resulted in a gain in reactivity of 9 6 cents

The second set of poison distributions involved the following
changes

1 The entire fuel surface was 95% covered by 27 8 kg of
stainless steel

2 All the Boral around the end ducts was removed

3 The rest of the assembly was as described previously

The remaining measurements described were obtained with the
reactor conteining this second set of poison distributions

Importance Function of Three Stainless Steel Rods

The loss in reactivity due to three 316 stainless steel rods
was determined at three radial positions in the reflector and
at one position in the island The rods were 3/16" in diameter,
and 36" long and each weighed 132 gn They were inserted as
skewers in the various cells and extended through the entire
shish on the stationary table The date obtained are shown in

C Thermal Neutron Leakage

Thermel neutron leakage was determined at the end and side of the
reactor, both with and without Boral shielding sround the end fuel
ducts These measurements were taken with 0, 1/8", 1/4", and 3/8"
thicknesses of Boral surrounding the U-235 fission chamber that
was used

The side leakage was measured with the U=235 fission chamber
located in cell D-12 The geometrical center of the chamber
rested 12" back of the interface on the stationary table or 3"
back of the mid-plane of the reactor The axis of the chamber
was approximately 1-1/2" from the edge of the graphite side
reflector and was parallel to the reactor axis The Boral layers
surrounding the chamber were in the form of concentric cylindrical
sleeves that extended from the interface of the stationary table

back 24" The inside diameter of the inner most layer was 2", and
the outside dlameter of the outer most layer, using 3 layers, was
about 2-3/4" The ends of the Boral sleeves were not capped

The end leakage was determined with the fission chamber placed
5.1/2" back of the end graphite reflector The axis of the
chamber was parallel to the floor and perpendicular to the axis

of the reactor, which passed through the geometrical center of the
chamber The data obtained are shown in Table VII-2 and Figure
VII-% All measurements are shown relative to. the side leakage
without any Boral shielding around the chamber or in the reactor

D Power Distribution

A radial power distribution was taken in the mid-plane across the
fuel annulus (cells P-12 and Q-12) The traverse was obtained by
Placing uranium and aluminum foils between the vertically adjacent
fuel tubes in the cells The data obtained are shown in Table
VII-3 and Figure VII-5
