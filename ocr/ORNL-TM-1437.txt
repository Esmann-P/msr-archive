A STUDY OF LEAD AND LEAD- SALT CORROSION IN
THERMAL -CONVECTION LOOPS

 

G. M. Tolson and A. Taboada
ABSTRACT

Thermal -convection loop tests of several structural
“alloys were operated using circulating molten lead.
Screening tests were run to evaluate Croloy 2 1/4 Cr,
carbon steel, AISI-type 410 stainless steel, and
Nb—1% Zr at conditions described in Table 1. Two of the
test loops contained surge tanks in which fluoride salts,
Nb-1% Zr alloy, and graphite were placed in contact with
the lead to determine the compatibility of these
materials in a direct-cooled lead system.

All of the steel loops tended to plug in the cold
regions because of formation of dendritic erystals of
"iron and chromium. . The hot-leg attack consisted of
general surface removal with a few large pits extending
to a greater depth. The Nb—1% Zr alloy showed no
measurable attack; however, niobium -crystals were found
in the cold leg of a loop which operated 5000 hr at
. 1400°F with a AT of 400°F.

INTRODUCTION

Liquid lead has been proposed as a coolant for molten-salt breeder

"reactors, In one reactor design, lead is in direct contact with salts

at temperatures up to 1100°F, thus eliminating a heat exchanger and
resulting in superior heat" transfer and thermal efficiencies. In another’

design, the lead extracts heat from the salt in a salt-lead heat exchanger.

The materials commonly used in reactors: at these temperatures, such as’

300 series stainless steels, Inconels, or Hastelloys, cannot ‘be used in

~ contact with lead because of the ‘high solubility levels of nickel in

lead “that result in excessive mass “transfer. The refractory: metals
offer very good corrosion ‘resistance but are difficult to fabricate and

are too expensive for a complete reactor system. Carbon steels offer

good corrosion resistance to liquid lead but are very marginal with
. respect to both strength and oxidation resistance, Since Croloys (steel

with 1 1/4 to 9% Cr and 1/2 to 1% Mo) and 400 series stainless steels
have good oxidation resistance, adequate strength, and contain no nickel,
these appeared to be the most promising material for this application.
Consequently, the primary effort was expended in evaluating these

materials. ..
LITERATURE SURVEY

A great portion of the liquid lead corrosion tests described in

 

the literature involves capsule tests that demonstrate the occurrence of ©
solution attack but do not adequately measure mass transfer. In addition, 7
no standard test procedure was used from one test to the hext. Test
specimens were contained in a variety of capsule materials such as
graphite, quartz, and the specimen material itself. Inhibitors were
frequently used, and a variety of methods were used to prevent oxidation..
The maximum test time was approximately 500 hr.

Results in these isothermal tests generally indicated that iron,
carbon steels, low-chromium steels, and chromium stainless steels
(nickel-free) had good resistance to corrosion by lead at temperatures
up to 1400°F. Austenitic stainless steels were good to 1000°F. Tan-
talum, niobium, and molybdenum were not attacked by lead at 1800°F,
Nickel and nickel-base alloys had poor resistance to attack by lead,
‘although the attack rate for Inconel at 1100°F was reported as
0.38 mils/year.® Other nonferrous alloys of Cu, Pt, Au, W, Sn, Zn, Mn,
Zr, and Ti behaved poorly or were not recommended. Carbon demonstrated 7
poor resistance to attack by lead at 1800°F but good resistance at
935°F,

In addition to the above, other experimentation has been done ~ 7
using thermal-convection loops to study mass transfer, As in the static
work, no standard test design existed, making comparison of data diffi-
cult, The effect of impurities in lead are not well understood. Oxygen \

~ has been reported to increase corrosion in lead. Some research indicates

that many elements may act as corrosion inhibitors. These inhibitors
could act to form a protective film in the case of titanium and zir-

conium (ref. 2), to. decrease the solubility of the container material in

lead as may be the case of nickel, or to remove oxygen from the system

. in: the case of magnesium,

In one of the investigations the relative resistance to mass

transfer in liquid lead of 24 metals and alloys was measured’ at 1472°F

‘maximum loop temperature and 300°F AT, The tests were run in quartz

thermal-convection loops with the alloy being studied formed into tubes

which were inserted into the hot leg and cold leg. In these tests

niobium and molybdenum exhibited no mass transfer after 500 hr of test,
Nickel-base alloys and austenitic stainless steels were highly susceptible
to mass transfer and plugged the loops within 100 hr, Intergranular
attack was noted in the hot region. The pure metals, Fe, Cr, Co, Ti,

and Ni, all plugged within 100 hr. The 400 series stainless steel
(chromium) and molybdenum-bearing alloys showed little evidence of mass
transfer after approximately 500 hr. There was some evidence of prefer-
ential leaching of chromium by lead in this type alloy. "Several inves-
tigators have studied the resistance of steels to corrosion by lead,
bismuth, and lead-bismuth alloys were found to be more corrosive than’
lead, the literature indicates that they all result in the same general

behavior patterns. The corrosion of steels in uninhibited lead was

reported to be about 1/40 of that noted in uninhibited bismuth under.
comparable conditions (1472°F maximum temperature with 212°F AT). The
most sophisticated work with lead and lead-bismuth alloys was, done by

BNL in conjunction with the IMFR R Progran.® Although only one lead loop

was operated, many bismuth and lead-bismuth.loop tests were conducted.
‘In general, the low-alloy steels and low-chromium steels exhibited the
best corrosion resistance to bismuth and lead-bismuth; however, titanium
and zirconium additions were required to obtain good corrosion resistance
in loops that operated above 752°F. The authors concluded that titanium
and zirconium inhibited corrosion by forming ZrN, TiN, and TiC on the
walls in the hottest regions of the loops. No corrosion occurred in
inhibited loops that operated for 10,000 hr at temperatures as high as
1022°F in bismuth and temperatures as high as 1202°F in lead-bismuth
eutectic, A single Croloy 2 1/4 steel loop containing zirconium-inhibited
lead was operated for over 27,000 hr with a 1022°F hot leg and approxi-
mately 212°F AT, Although the zirconium additions had been made, the
zirconium was not detected by chemical analysis of the solution. . The
lead also contained about 250 ppm of magnesium, which had been added to
prevent loss of zirconium by oxidation, and it may have had an inhibiting
effect.

DESCRIPTION OF TESTS

Six uninhibited thermal-convection loop tests were performed at
ORNL to explore the compatibility of materials with lead under conditions
expected in molten salt reactors. ‘One additional loop test was also
performed to evaluate the performance of a newly designed thermal -
convection loop. A description of the loop and the results are presented
in the Appendix. The operating conditions for all the loops are summarized
‘in Table 1.

Two of the loops (type 410 stainless steel and 2 1/4 Cr steel) had
Nb-1% Zr alloy liners in the surge tanks. Molten Salt Reactor Experiment
fuel salt® floated on the lead surface in the surge tanks as shown in
Fig. 1. These loops also contained a graphite specimen in the surge tank
which was exposed to both the salt and the lead at the lead-salt inter-
face. The maximum temperature in the loops was about 1200°F and the AT
was 300°F.

RESULTS OF TESTS

Of the two steel loops that contained salt, the 2 1/4 Cr steel

- plugged after only 288 hr and the type 410 stainless steel plugged after

1346 hr. As shown in Fig. 2, the plugs were made up of dendritic
crystals, which were determined to be iron and chromium by x-ray diffrac-
tion and wet chemical analysis, The maximum depth of attack on the type

410 stainless steel piping in the hot leg was 2 mils, as determined by

metallographic examination. The pitting in the hot leg of the 2 1/4 Cr
loop showed about 1 mil of attack, as can be seen in Fig. 3. No corro=
sion was observed on the Nb—1% Zr liner, as demonstrated bythe photo-
micrograph shown in Fig. 4. |

After 648 hr of operation, the cold leg of the 2 1/4 Cr loop,
‘which contained no salt or graphite, began to plug as indicated by
decreasing cold-leg temperature. In order to determine if the hot leg
was. being selectively attacked, the lead was dumped from the loop and
the hot leg was radiograghed. Several areas were noted where the lead
had wet the metal and had not drained from the loop, thus indicating
selective dttack.” The lead that was dumped from the loop was examined

and found to contain crystals of iron and chromium which had floated to
the top surface during cooling. The loop was then refilled with new
lead, restarted, and operated for 5156 hr. The increased time of opera-
tion without plugging does not necessarily mean a decrease in corrosion
“rate since plugging time is not a function of corrosion rate. Post-
test metallographic examination of the cold-leg region showed the

' presence of a large amount of dendritic crystals, as revealed in Fig. 5.

 

7Brockhaven previously had found that areas of selective attack
could. be identified in mercury systems in this manner because of the
increased wetting action of the liquid metal.

The approximate depth of hot-leg attack as determined by the change in
wall thickness averaged 5 mils and could have been as deep as 8 mils,
The uncertainty in the depth of attack is due to the pitting nature of
the attack and the variation in the wall thickness. Analysis of the
crystals in the cold leg showed about the same Fe/Cr/Mo ratio as that
existing in the original loop piping alloy. A black film found floating
on the lead in the top of the surge tank was identified as MnO by x-ray
diffraction and spectrographic analysis, The manganese was probably
preferentially leached from the hot leg and then deposited in the surge
tank as it scavenged oxygen from the rest of the system materials.

The carbon steel loop, constructed of large-diameter pipe, operated
for 5000 hr before shutdown. Prior to shutdown, the loop was beginning
to show some signs of restricted flow, Subsequent measurements of the
wall thickness of the loop piping showed a maximum of 10 and an average
of 7 mils of attack similar to that found in the 2 1/4 loops (see Fig. 6).

The loops constructed of No-1% Zr clad with type 446.stainless
steel were shut down after only 385 hr of operation due to a faulty
relay in the control system. The loop that contained salt could not be
restarted, probably due to separation of a high-melting constituent of
the salt upon cooling. The loop that contained only lead was restarted
and operated 5280 hr. Posttest metallographic examination showed no
significant hot-leg attack, as indicated by the photograph shown in
Fig. 7. .Some mass transfer crystals were found in this loop, as shown
in Fig. 8. The crystals were found to be 90 to 100% Nb by electron

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The results of “thé tests are given in Table 2 along with a

Brookhaven loop to use as a comparison. The poor performance of the

 ferritic materials described here suggests that these materials are

unsuitable to contain lead at the conditions investigated. This is
surprising in light of the 27,795-hr Brookhaven Loop. The 78°F dif-
ference in hot-leg temperature between our 5156-<hr loop and the
Brookhaven loop is not great enough to explain the several orders of
magnitude difference in the corrosion. ' The difference could be due to
the inhibiting effect of the magnesium, used as a deoxident in the
Brookhaven loop. Previously cited literature describing the benefit
to be derived by inhibitors offers a possible remedy. The most promising
inhibitor for our system would be titanium since it is also compatible
with the salt,? It is ‘therefore recommended that several tests be per-
formed to evaluate the effect of titanium and/or maghesium as inhibitors
ina steel-liquid lead system.

The Nb—1% Zr in these tests had better compatibility" at higher :
temperatures than the ferritic materials. Although it is expensive and
at present difficult to fabricate, Nb—1% Zr could possibly be used in the

~ high-temperature portion of a bimetal system, It is therefore suggested

that the effects of MSRE salt in a Mo-1% Zr- lead systen be further
investigated.

‘The loops that were used in this investigation were run for
screening purposes and were not designed to obtained a maximum amount of
data. Corrosion rates on the loops could only be determined metallo-

graphically. Since the attack occurs as uniform surface removal, the

depth of attack could only be determined by wall thickness differences,
‘an inaccurate method due to the variation in original pipe wall thick-

ness. Consequently, a new Loop design has been developed and is des-

~ eribed in the Appendix. ~The new loop gives better control of ‘the loop

variables. end provides for improved methods of analysis,

APPENDIX

In an effort £6 increase the value of thermal-convection loop tests,

a new test loop ¥ was developed (see Fig. 10) incorporating the following

“Peatures:

1. Removable hot-leg samples for both weight-change measurements and
metallographic analysis. Samples can be removed without contacting
the salt. Bh | |

2. Temperature control by a thermocouple located in the lead. The
- thermocouple is movable so that a temperature profile of the hot
leg can also be obtained.

3. MSRE salt floating on lead in contact with both the Nb—1% Zr liner
and graphite in the surge tank.

4, Miniaturized design to facilitate sectioning or radiographing of the
complete loop.

5. Sampling of both the lead and salt.

6. A method by which the Loop may be drained and refilled without
removing the salt so that the hot leg can be radiographed to find
selective attack and so that mass transfer crystals may. be removed
by gravity ‘separation. |

7. Improved control of the cold-leg temperature.

A prototype loop of the new design was run to test the temperature

distribution and the sample removal and cleaning techniques. = The Loop

operated with a hot-leg temperature of 1100 and 1200°F and a maximum

AT of 230°F. The sample cleaning techniques that were developed con=-

sisted of amalgamation of the lead. with mercury and then removal of the

along with the loop specimens. showed no significant weight change. One

of the removable samples used in the loop was zirconium. It did not
“lose or gain any weight. Since the loop plugged after 1848 hr of opera-

tion end showed a maximum of 4. > mils of attack, it is apparent. that the
presence of zirconium aid not significantly affect the corrosion behavior

in the system,’

In the new loop, better control over the cold-leg temperature is
achieved through the use of a cold-leg heater placed at the inlet to the
cold leg of the loop. This heater is controlled by the cold-leg thermo-

couple. A shutdown device is also incorporated which terminates the

loop when the temperature at the cold-leg heater equals that of the hot
leg. With this design, the degree of plugging may be determined by the
power consumption of the cold-leg heater. - The system worked very well in

the prototype test and will be used on future loops.
