ABSTRACT

In order to increase the operating temperature of gas-cooled reactors
one must consider many problems in the selection of structural materials
and fuel element claddings. Among these are the interactions of active
metals and gases together with the attendant changes in the creep
properties, ductility, and rupture life. In this paper various types of
gas-metal interactions are discussed and their effects upon the service
performance of metals are illustrated by experimental data. Pure gases
which are potentially suitable for reactor coolants as well as those gases
which may be present as impurities were studied, These include Ar, H,,
C0p, CO, Np, On, and air, Three basic classes of materials were evaluated:
austenitic stainless steels, nickel-~base alloys, and refractory metals,

The results of tests of austenitic stainless steels over the
temperature range of 700 to 900°C show that thelr properties are
essentially equivalent in argon and in hydrogen enviromments. Various
degrees of strengthening were observed in air, N,, Op, CO, and CO,
environments. The results of a series of tests at 815°C in enviromments
containing various partial pressures of oxygen in argon are presented which
show that the properties of stainless steels can be markedly altered by
the presence of a few partes per million of oxygen. The responsible
mechanisms are postulated in each case,

The work on nickel-base alloys was centered around Inconel and "A"
nickel. However, supplementary tests were conducted on high-purity nickel
and on several laboratory melis to evaluate the influence of composition.
In contrast with the austenitic stainless steels, these tests show that
the creep propertles of nickel-base alloys are inferior in hydrogen as
compared with those observed in argon. This effect is manifested through
an increase in the secondary creep rate and a decrease in the time to
rupture. No significant changes in ductility were observed. Enviromments
which are carburizing, oxidizing, or nitriding are shown to result in én
increase in the creep strength of nickel-base alloys. Proposed mechanisms

for the observed creep behavior ere presented.
The refractory metals, exemplified by columbium, were found to be
strengthened at room temperature by the addition of controlled amounts
of oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, or carbon. However, serious embrittlement
resulted if excessive quantities were added. Allowable concentration
limits for each of the above interstitials are presented. The increase
in high-temperature creep strength of columbium as a result of the

addition of nitrogen and oxygen is demonstrated.

PROPERTIES OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS SELECTED FOR HIGH-TEMPERATURE SERVICE

INTRODUCTION

One currently feasible concept proposed for gas-cooled reactors
involves a nonradicactive coolant, which requires that the nuclear fuel
be properly clad to prevent the release of fission gases into the coolant.
It is this cladding which imposes a limitation on the maximum operating
temperatures and allowable rates of burnup. Because of the present status
of knowledge of the fabrication and of performance of ceramic-clad fuel
elements, the nuclear industry is depending heavily upon metallic clad-
dings. The austenitic stainless steels, the iron-chromium-aluminum
alloys, and several nickel-base alloys have all been used as cladding
materials. Since all these materials absorb neutrons and hence increase
the fuel inventory, the minimum thickness is used. The refractory metals,
such as niobium, offer some improvement with respect to higher operating
temperatures and better neutron economy. Several gaseous coolants being
used in reactors already in operation or under construction include helium,
carbon dioxide, air, and Np—0.5 vol % O,. Except for its hazardous nature,
the properties of hydrogen [1] establish it as the superior gaseous
coolant. Also, impurities in the coolants will be of concern, Air in-
leakage results in the introduction of significant quantities of oxygen,
nitrogen, and water vapor. The outgassing of components within the system,

such as graphite, can also introduce significant quantities of impurities.
In choosing a metallic cladding one must remember that the service
environment is an important variable, for no material has a unique set
of strength values at a given temperature. The gas-metal interactions
which can occur between coolant and cladding could result in significant
changes in the creep properties, ductility, and rupture life of the
cladding material. Consequently, the chemical compatibility of the
cladding material with the coclant and impurities present in the coolant
must be considered.

Although numerous other factors are of importance, this paper is
concerned primarily with the problem of gas-metal compatibility and the
resultant mechanical property changes. The classes of materials studied
were austenitic stainless steels, nickel-base alloys, and refractory
metals, and the data deal primarily with a few representative materials
from each class: type 304 stainless steel, Inconel, high-purity nickel,
and niobium. The environments studied were Ar, Hp, CO, COp, Na, Op, and
air. The gases used were of the highest available purity, although the
gas composition would not necessarily be analogous to that expected in
a reactor, This approach enables a clearer interpretation of the test
results and yet reveals potential gas-metal compatibility problems which

may arise in various mixtures of these gases.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

Type 304 stainless steel and Inconel in the form of 0.060- and
0.020-in., sheet were used in these studies. Materials from several heats
were used. However, the compositions of all materials fell within the

commercial specifications given in Table I. Exact compositions are

given when they are of importance. The specimens prepared from the
0,060-1in, sheet had a gage width of 0.500 in. and a gage length of
4.00 in.; those prepared from the 0.020-in. sheet had gage dimensions
of 0.250 x 2.50 in, Sheet specimens were chosen because of their large
ratio of surface area to volume, The equipment and experimental procedure
for running stress~rupture and tensile tests in controlled environments
have been described previously [2].

Small niobium tabs 1.25 x 1.00 x 0.040 in. were contaminated with
controlled amounts of carbon and were subjected to bend tests at room

temperature. The details of the test procedure are reported elsewhere [3].

RESULTS

Creep-Rupture Tests — Type 304 Stainless Steel

The results of creep-rupture tests in Ar, CO, COp, Hp, Np, 0p, and
alr are given in Figs, 1 and 2 for conditions where sufficient tests were
run at equivalent temperatures and stresses for the environmental effects
to be compared. In most cases each curve plotted represents the results
of at least two tests, The creep behavior in argon is used as the
reference with which the properties in other environments are compared.

For the test conditions examined, the various test environments
influenced the creep properties in the following ways:

1. At 1500 and 1700°F (816 and 927°C) air or nitrogen decreased the
creep rate, and CO and CO had a strengthening effect.

2. At 1500°F (816°C) the creep strength was essentially the same in

argon and hydrogen but was less in oxygen than in argon,

3. At 1700°F (927°C) the creep life was less in hydrogen than in
argon but was strengthened in an oxygen environment.

The reduction of strength observed at 1500°F (816°C) in oxygen was
somewhat unexpected. In an effort to more fully evaluate the influence of
oxygen on the creep properties of type 304 stainless steel, a series of
creep tests were run in various argon-oxygen mixtures, The results of
these tests are summarized in Figs. 3, 4, and 5. The oxygen-argon
mixtures were prepared in standard gas cylinders, and a flow rate through
the test chamber of approximately 0.1 £3 /hr was used. The relatively
large effects of small partial pressures of oxygen on the creep strength
probably account for the difficulties encountered in reproducing test
results in an argon enviromment. The crack density plot shown in Fig, 5
was determined metallographically.

Several specimens were examined metallographically. Figure 6
illustrates a typical microstructure, except for some variation in grain
size, of specimens tested in argon and hydrogen at temperatures between
1500 and 1700°F (816 and 927°C). The steps on the surface resulted from
grain-boundary sliding and rotation of the grains and were not observed
unless the surface of the specimen was completely free of oxide,

Figure 7 is a photomicrograph of the gage section of & specimen
tested at 3400 psi in air at 1500°F (816°C) for 3025 hr, Features of
importance are the surface oxlde, the surface and internal cracks which
follow grain boundaries, and the precipitate present. Relevant test data
from several specimens tested at various stresses in air at 1700°F (927°C)
are given in Table IT. The formation of a nitride precipitate was

obviously not a unique function of the total test time but was related to

the strain rate. Figure 8 further illustrates the importance of strain
rate. Heavy precipitation occurred along the gage section with a very
abrupt decrease in amount as the cross-sectional area was increased. This
general precipitate, as evidenced by the photomicrograph in the upper left
corner of Fig. 8, is actually composed of two phases, one lamellar in
nature and the other of Widmanstditen geometry. The selective etching
technique of Dulis and Smith [4] was used in which the matrix in the
surface layer of the specimen wag dissolved by prolonged attack in an
alcoholic solution of picric and hydrochloric acids. The diffraction
pattern of the surface was obtained with a recording spectrometer, and
the diffraction lines indicated the presence of CrN and Cr,N. Specimens
tested in nitrogen at 1500 and 1700°F (816 and 927°C) also contained a
nitride precipitate.

Figure 9 is a photomicrograph of a specimen tested at 1500°F (816°C)
and 3000 psi in an oxygen environment, A second phase near the surface
was tentatively identified by selective etching techniques as ferrite.
The microstructure of a specimen tested in oxygen at 1700°F (927°C) is
illustrated in Fig. 10. At this temperature the second phase outlines
extensively the grain boundaries.

A microstructure characteristic of specimens stressed at 3700 psi in
CO at 1500°F (816°C) for 1731 hr is shown in Fig. 1l. After the test had
been discontinued at the end of 1731 hr, the specimen was subjected to
a standard tensile test at room temperature. Figure lla shows the gage
portion of the specimen and illustrates a case of fine carbide particles
near the surface. Figure 1llb is a photograph of the shoulder portion of

the test specimen and shows a large concentration of voids near the

surface. It is believed that these voids were originally filled by
oxides which were lost during polishing. At 1700°F (927°C) the carbides
became much coarser and the rate of carburization increased significantly.

Specimens tested in CO, over the range 1300 to 1700°F (704 to 927°C)
vere observed to be carburized, as is illustrated by Fig. 12 of a specimen
tested at 3400 psi in CO, at 1500°F (816°C) for 1727 hr, at which time
the test was discontinued and the specimen subjected to a standard room-
temperature tensile test. In Fig. 12a, showing the gage section of this
specimen, there is evidence of considerable carburization although no
case ls visible. Figure 12b shows an edge of the shoulder portion of the
specimen and large subsurface volds similar to those shown in Fig. 1llb
and believed to have been formed similarly.

Microstructural examinations of specimens tested in CO, indicated
that the type of carbide dispersion obtained depends upon the exposure
conditions, Figure 13 is a photomicrograph of a specimen prestralned 10%
at room temperature and stressed at 7000 psi in CO, at 1500°F (816°C) and
shows that the carbon decorates the dislocations introduced by the cold
working as compared with the more random carbide distribution in Fig. 12.
Another significant difference in carbide distributions is illustrated
by Figs. 14 and 15. Figure 14 illustrates the semicontinuous grain-
boundary network and the random coarse precipitate that occurred in a
specimen stressed at 3000 psi in CO, at 1700°F (927°C). All the
precipitate was concentrated at the grain boundaries in a specimen exposed
to flowing CO, for 200 hr at 1700°F (927°C) without an applied stress, as

is shown in Fig, 15.

Influence of C0, on the Tensile Properties
of Type 304 Stainless Steel

Because of the observed increase in carbon concentration as a result
of exposure to C0p, a series of tensile tests were run in an effort to
evaluate the influence of this carbon increase on the rupture ductility.
A group of specimens 0.020 in. thick were exposed to flowing CO, for
times up to 1000 hr and at temperatures ranging from 1100 to 1700°F (593
to 927°C). Control specimens were run in argon to separate the influences
of thermal treatment and exposure to CO,., Pairs of specimens annealed
under duplicate conditions were tested in tension at 75 and 1250°F (25
and 677°C); the results are summarized in Table III. The following obser-
vations were made:

1. The control specimens showed that subsequent heating in argon
at less than the 1900°F (1038°C) homogenization temperature caused a
change in the material properties. As a result of this instability, the
room-temperature tensile ductility was reduced. The tensile ductility of
the controls at 1R250°F (677°C) was increased by the thermal treatment, the
magnitude of the improvement increasing with increasing annealing
temperature.

2. At both 75 and 1250°F (25 and 677°C) the tensile ductility was
decreased by exposure to COp., The decrease in ductility seemed, for a

given annealing time, to increase with the temperature of annealing.

to the extent that the stress-rupture life of Inconel was greater in air
than in argon. Figure 16 also illustrates the dependence of the environ
mental effect on the size of the test section. Much greater strengthening
occurred in the 0,020-in.~-thick specimen than in the 0,060~-in.-thick one,

boundary oxidation in the gage section but gave no evidence of nitride

A limited number of tests were run to evaluate the intrinsic effects
of oxygen and nitrogen on the creep behavior of Tnconel, Figure 17
illustrates the strengthening due to nitrogen being absorbed and the
formation of a nitride precipitate. The creep behavior in oxygen was
not significantly different from that in air. Figure 18a illustrates

specimen was elongated 73.44% there was no evidence of necking. However,

an oxidizing atmosphere to inhibit crack propagation.

Inconel is strengthened in carburizing atmospheres in a manner
similar to that illustrated in Fig. 17 for a nitrogen enviromment. The
strength is improved as a result of the solution strengthening provided
by soluble carbon and as a result of dispersion strengthening due to a

dispersed carbide phase,

The characteristics of the influence of hydrogen on the mechanical
properties of Inconel are illustrated in Fig. 20, which shows the results
of several creep tests run at 1500°F (816°C) in hydrogen and argon
environments, The tests were run in pairs — one specimen in argon and
another in hydrogen at an equivalent stress. The influence of hydrogen
was observed to become greater as the stress level (or strain rate) was
decreased. For example, the rupture lives of two specimens tested in
argon and in hydrogen at 10,000 psi were essentially the same, but
differed by a factor of 3 between the pair of specimens tested at
3500 psi. Another important characteristic of this effect is that the
environmental influence was manifested through both an increase in the
secondary creep rate and a decrease in the time required for tertiary
creep to occur, as was obvious from the pair of tests at 3500 psi. The
third characteristic is that there was essentially no difference in the
ductilities of two specimens tested at equivalent stress levels. Any
ductility differences shown in Fig. 20 are small enough to be attributed
to experimental scatter.

Representative photomicrographs of the gage sections of fhe pair of
specimens tested at 3500 psi are shown in Figs. 21 and 22, in which both
the density and the geometry of the cracks in the two specimens can be
seen 10 be essentially equivalent. A very close examination of the cracks
shows that many are composed of chains of wvolds rather than being wedge-
shaped with smooth edges.

Although the experimental observations in argon and hydrogen environ
ments just described refer specifically to Inconel, similar cbservations

were made for several other nickel-base alloys, including "A" nickel and

number of tests were run with nickel refined by an electron-beam~-zone
process. The results of one such test are given in Table IV. The test
environment was cycled periodically between argon and hydrogen; the creep
rate in hydrogen was greater by a factor of 2 than that in an argon envi-
ronment. These data also illustrate the reversible nature of the environ-

mental effect.

Effect of Carbon on the Room-Temperature
Bend Properties of Niobium

The results of tests to evaluate the effects of nitrogen, oxygen, and
hydrogen on the room-temperature bend properties of niobium have been
described previously [3]. The results of additional tests to illustrate
the influence of carbon additions are given in Table V. The stress
values in Table V are based on an elastic-stress analysis of the test
specimen, Therefore the yield and ultimate stresses were of value only
for comparison since plastic deformation occurred. Although carbon
improved the strengin slightly, 1t was not as effective as equivalent
amounts of oxygen and nitrogen. Carbon concentrations as great as 2100 ppm
did not seriously reduce the room-temperature ductility of niobium.

Figure 23 illustrates the microstructure of a bend specimen containing

1000 ppm C (We. 106).

by which the properties are altered. Most of the changes in properties
that occur from carburizing or nitriding seemingly can be explained by the
theories of dispersion strengthening. The enhancement of creep properties
obtained through carburization and nitriding has been demonstrated by
Swindeman and Douglas [5].

The current results show that the magnitude of the enhancement of
creep properties in a carburizing atmosphere is a function of the quantity
of carbon absorbed by the specimen, At 1500°F (816°C) the creep rate was
higher in CO, than in CO (Fig. 1), a behavior consistent with expectations
since the carburization rate was higher in CO than in CO,. Also, the
creep rates in both environments decreased with time, again indicating a
dependence on the carbon concentration. At 1700°F (927°C) the creep-
rupture behavior was similar to that Just described.

Although these data clearly demonstrate the influence of the quantity
of carbon present, there are more subtle factors which may be of importance,
for example, the size and distribution of carbides. Carbide distribution
of specimens exposed to CO, was affected by stress (cf, Figs. 14 and 15)
and by prestraining (cf. Figs. 12 and 13). It was also found that rather
complex arrays of carbides could be formed in as-received material by cold
working and subsequent thermal treatments, This is illustrated quite well
by the work of Garafalo [6] on the ability of carbides to retard the move-
ment of dislocations in type 316 stainless steel during creep at 1100,
1300, and 1500°F (593, 704, and 816°C). Specimens were solution-annealed,
prestrained, annealed at 900°F (482°C) to precipitate the carbides along
dislocations, and creep-tested in the above temperature range. This treat-

ment resulted in an enhancement of creep properties. However, the amount
- 40 =

of prestraining was found to be important since agglomeration cccurred at
prestrains in excess of 25%. Another factor of possible importance is

the change in chemistry of the metal brought about by the formation of
carbides, If the carbide formed is Crps3Cg, 1.67 wt % Cr will be taken

out of solution for every 0.1 wt % C added. The depletion of the matrix
in chromium probably increases the solubility of the interstitial elements
oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon, Work is currently in progress to evaluate
these secondary processes,

It is felt that environments which cause nitriding enhance the creep
properties through the same mechanisms Just discussed for carburization.
However, the conditions under which nitrogen is absorbed are important.
During tests in pure nitrogen nitrides were formed at 1500 and 1700°F
(816 and 927°C) but those formed at 1500°F (816°C) were only in areas that
had undergone large deformation, At 1700°F (927°C), nitride formation
was more general and large quantities of nitrogen were introduced.

A series of tests at 1700°F (927°C) in air showed that the formation
of nitrides was a definite function of the strain rate and probably
depended also upon the time of exposure (Table IT). At 1500°F (816°C) no
nitride formation was observed in specimens tested for as long as 3025 hr
in air. However, Dulis and Smith [4] describe a type 304 stainless steel
specimen tested in air at 1500°F (816°C) for 10,000 hr in which nitrides
were formed, On the basis of the results Just described 1t was concluded
that the formation of nitrides in type 304 stainless steel tested in air
was a function of the strain rate, the temperature, and the time of
exposure, The combination of factors necessary to produce nitriding is

one which will make a clean surface available to the nitrogen. If the
- 41 a

strain rate is not sufficient for the reactive metal surface to be exposed,
extremely long times are required for the nitrogen to permeate or diffuse
through the surface oxide,

The influence of oxygen on the creep properties was cone of strength-
ening at 1700°F (927°C), the mechanism probably being that of internal
oxidation, but was somewhat deleterious at 1500°F (816°C) (cf. Figs. 1
and 2). In an effort to better understand the influence of oxygen at
1500°F (816°C) a series of tests at various oxygen partial pressures
were run. A marked strengthening was observed at very low oxygen levels
but subsequently became reduced at higher levels (Figs. 3 and 4). This
aifference was manifested both through an influence on the secondary creep
rate and by the rupture life, The crack density increased as the oxygen
concentration was increased (Fig. 5). The results of these tests are
currently unexplainable since all of the oxygen pressures except the
lowest resulted in surface oxidation, However, they cause strengthening
by the mechanism of internal oxidation in this material at 1500°F (816°C)
and oxygen pressures near 1 atm to be viewed with skepticism.

In light of the observations made regarding the behavior of materials
in pure oxygen at 1500°F (816°C), there is some doubt as to the mechanism
responsible for the enhancement of creep properties observed in air at
this temperature. It was pointed out previously that no nitrides were
visible in specimens tested in air at 1500°F (816°C). Although vacuum-
fusion analyses do not indicate a substantial increase in nitrogen, they
ao represent the average of a cross section of the specimen; consequently,
the nitrogen concentration could be relatively high near the surface with

out raising the average. Therefore it is presently postulated that the
- 42 -

observed strengthening in air at 1500°F (816°C) was due to nitrogen near
the surface inhibiting the formation and propagation of cracks. At
1700°F (927°C), however, oxidation did seem to provide some degree of
strenthening, and the enhancement of creep properties in air may be a
consequence of both nitriding and oxidation.

Oxidation also occurred in CO and CO, environments. In light of the
tests run in pure oxygen, it is felt that such strengthening was due
primarily to carburization.

At 1500°F (816°C) the creep properties were essentially the same in
argon and hydrogen; at 1700°F (927°C), however, they were inferior in
hydrogen, probably because of the removal of carbon by the hydrogen.

An improvement in the creep resistance of type 304 stainless steel
was obtained by the addition of carbon but was accompanied by a reduction
in rupture ductility. The following generalizations concerning the
influence of carbon content seem to be warranted:

1. The ductility was reduced as the carbon content was increased.

2. Burface layers high in carbon served as nucleation sites for
cracks which propagated across the test plece., Hence, for a given average
carbon content, the ductility was higher if the carbon was uniformly
distributed.

Although the ductility was not reduced to an alarming level by
moderate carbon additions, the problem is worthy of serious consideration.
It is conceivable that carbon concentrations in excess of 1 or 2 wt % may
result over long periods of use in a carburizing environment. Another

reason for concern is that the role of carbon distribution has not been
- 43

evaluated. Carbon distributions more embrittling in nature than those
studied might easily be obtained as a result of the mechanical and thermal

cycling that might be encountered during the operation of a reactor.

Nickel=-Base Alloys

The creep-rupture results for Inconel (Fig. 16) showed that the
strengthening effect of an oxidizing environment was manifested principally
through increasing the time of tertiary creep. It was shown further
(Fig. 19) that severe cracking occurred in an oxidizing atmosphere but
that none of the cracks were able to propagate to failure. Hence it was
concluded that the strenthening effect in this material was due to the
internal oxidation of impurities and the resulting dispersion of oxide
particles, which retarded the propagation of nucleated cracks, Similar
observations were made of "A" nickel and reported previously [7]. A
significant observation made during the current work was that the creep
behavior of Inconel is the same in air and in oxygen at 1500°F (816°C).
Different rates were observed for type 304 stainless steel under similar
conditions.

Since Inconel can be carburized and nitrided in a manner similar to
type 304 stainless steel, the introduction of significant quantities of
carbon and nitrogen results in strengthening. Pure nickel and nickel-base
alloys which do not contain carbide-forming elements cannot be significant-
ly strengthened by these processes because of the very low solubility of
carbon and nitrogen in these materials.

The creep properties of Inconel In hydrogen were inferior to those

observed in argon (Fig. 20). It was also noted that the environmental
effect becomes greater as the strain rate decreases and that it does not

result in any embrittlement of the metal. Data were obtained (Table IV)

which showed that the environmental influence is reversible, at least for
high-purity nickel.

Following these observations, proposal of a mechanism to account for
the observed behavior is needed, Two obvious possibilities deserve atten=-
tion: (1) some chemical change occurs; for example, subsurface oxides
may be reduced by hydrogen to form water such as has been observed in
copper [8], although this results in a loss of ductility, which is contrary
to experimental observations in the present case; (2) carbon is removed
by surface decarburization. Chemical analyses indicated that this second
process does not occur at a detectable rate. The fact that an environmen-
tal effect was observed with high-purity nickel does not substantiate an
impurity effect, nor does the reversible nature of the effect. However,
sufficient work has not been done to completely eliminate the possibility
of an impurity effect.

Another possibility, resulting from the mechanism proposed for low-
temperature embrittlement [9], is that segregation of hydrogen around
a crack nuclei is required for a crack to form. For example,

Livshitz et al. [10] observed that welds in steels were embrittled by
prolonged heating in hydrogen in the range 500 to 600°C. They proposed
that this loss in toughness must be associated not only with the possibil~
ity of iron-carbide decomposition and the formation of methane but also
with the hydrogen atoms diffused in the metal combining into molecules,
causing stresses in microregions and embrittlement of the material. The

quite high mobility of hydrogen [11] in nickel at elevated temperatures,
- 45

however, makes any mechanism which depends upon the segregation of
hydrogen seem unrealistic.

A further discussion of how hydrogen influences the creep behavior of
nickel~base alloys would require a clear picture of the creep process in
the absence of hydrogen. Any review of the huge volume of work carried
out in an effort to define and understand high-temperature creep processes
is beyond the scope of this paper, and the reader is referred to the excel-
lent review by Davies and Dennison [12]. However, the concept of high-
temperature stress rupture, as presented by Cottrell [13], is worthy of
brief mention because of its relevance, Cottrell envisions two processes
which ultimately lead tc intergranular failure: one occurring at high
strain rates and involving the formation of cracks at triple points or at
other points of high stress concentrations, and the other becoming opera-
tive when small stresses are applied for long periods of time. In the
latter process small holes nucleate at grain boundaries and grow as a
result of vacancy condensation, It is currently proposed that the first
deformation process is not significantly influenced by the presence of
hydrogen but that the second process is affected, possibly through a
reduction of the surface energy. This would in turn increase the driving
force for the growth of voids by vacancy condensation. There are numerous
details of this hypothesis which must be filled in and work toward this

end is currently in progress.
Niobium

Work reported previously [3] illustrating the influence of oxygen,
nitrogen, and hydrogen on the room-temperature bend strength of pure

niobium is reviewed briefly here. Although oxygen is an effective
- 46 -

strengthener, concentrations in excess of 3000 ppm result in serious
embrittlement, Nitrogen is a very potent strengthener. For example,
increasing the nitrogen content from 48 ppm to 460 ppm changes the yield
strength from 41,000 psi to 84,200 psi. However, a concentration as high
as 1000 ppm drastically reduces the rupture ductility. This may be due
in part to the presence of a very thin nitride film on the surface, The
homogenization treatment was not sufficient to effect complete
homogenization,

Hydrogen concentrations in excess of 500 ppm seriously embrittle
niobium at room temperature. A slight amount of strengthening is observed
with the addition of small concentrations of hydrogen. The absorption
rate of hydrogen in niobium seems to be greatest in the range 500 to 600°C,
where a stable hydride is formed. The kinetics of formation of this
hydride were observed to be quite rapid and the hydride was formed in
all specimens cooled through the above temperature range in the presence
of hydrogen or water vapor.

A very limited number of creep and tensile tests at approximately
1800°F (982°C) showed that moderate oxygen and nitrogen additions improved
the high-temperature strength of niobium. The strength was decreased by
the presence of hydrogen or water vapor.

The present studies showed that carbon additions did not result in
gross improvements in the room-temperature strength of niobium, For example,
increasing the carbon concentration from 140 to 2100 ppm increased the
yield strength only from 41,000 to 47,400 psi. The material was not

embrittled by this large quantity of carbon.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The experimental observations which have been presented illustrate
the effects of several gaseous environments on the mechanical properties
of type 304 stainless steel, Inconel, high-purity nickel, and niobium,
Type 304 stainless steel was studied over the range 1500 to 1700°F (816
to 927°C) in environments of Ar, Hp, CO, COp, Np, air, and Os. To
evaluate the influence of CO, on rupture ductility, a series of tensile
tests were run on samples which had been exposed to CO; for various times
over the range 1100 to 1700°F (593 to 927°C). Inconel was studied in Ar,
Hp, Nz, Op, and air environments at 1500°F (8l6°C). High-purity nickel
was studied in argon and hydrogen environments at 1500 and 1700°F (816 and
927°C). A review is presented on the influence of additions of oxygen,
nitrogen, and hydrogen on the room-temperature properties of niobium as
evaluated by bend tests on samples containing controlled amounts of each
impurity. Also reviewed are the high-temperature creep properties of
niobium as evaluated in environments of dry hydrogen, wet hydrogen, wet
argon, argon plus air, nitrogen, and pure argon. New data are presented
on the effect of carbon additions to niobium on the room-temperature bend
properties.

Type 304 Stainless Steel, — Ll. Creep data determined in pure argon

 

are conservative values for design purposes compared with data obtained
in all enviromments except hydrogen and possibly pure oxygen.

2. Air and nitrogen increase the creep resistance at 1500 and 1700°F
(816 and 927°C). It is felt that nitrogen absorption is primarily

responsible for the observed strengthening in air.
- 48 -

3. Carburization occurs in environments of CO and CO, and both
enviromments increase the creep resistance. Various types of carbide
dispersions can be obtained by different mechanical and thermal treatments,

4, The ductility is reduced as a result of carburization, with the
extent dependent upon the quantity of carbon absorbed by the material and
the distribution of the carbon.

Inconel, — 1. The creep-rupture life is improved by oxidizing
conditions, manifested through an increase in the duration of tertiary
creep, Equivalent creep rates are observed in air and in oxygen.

2. The creep strength is improved in a nitrogen environment as =
result of nitrogen absorption.

3. The creep properties of several nickel-base alloys in a hydrogen
environment were observed to be inferior to those in argon. This effect
was manifested through both an increase in the secondary creep rate and a
decrease in the time required for the initiation of tertiary creep. The
rupture ductility is not significantly affected. Tests on high-purity
nickel nave shown the effect to be reversible.

Niobium. — 1. The room-temperature strength of pure niobium is im-
proved by additions of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen. Nitrogen
seems to be the most potent strengthener. Embrittlement results from
additions of nitrogen greater than 1000 ppm, of oxygen in excess of
3000 ppm, and of hydrogen greater than 500 ppm. Carbon additions as high
as 2100 ppm do not seriously reduce the ductility.

2. The creep properties of nicbium at elevated temperatures are im-

proved by environments which result in the absorption of oxygen or nitrogen.
- 49 -

The ductility reductions are not so severe as those observed at room
temperature.

3. The high-temperature creep strength in a hydrogen environment
is inferior to that observed in argon.

These results indicate that no material has a unique set of strength
values, but rather that various properties are exnibited as the service
environment is changed. They also show that all environmental influences
are not undesirable. In fact, most materials exhibit their minimum
strength in neutral or reducing conditions. Since environmental influences
cannot be eliminated, it is important that the reactor designer understand
these influences and use them to nis advantage. It is hoped that the
findings reported herein will contribute to a general understanding of
gas-metal interactions and their influence on the mechanical behavior of

metals.
