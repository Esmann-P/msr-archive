Part 1. MSRE Operations and Construction,
Engineering Analysis, and Component Development

 

 

1. MSRE Operations

Preparations for power operation were completed, and the M3RE was
operated at nuclear powers up to 1 Mw before the system was shut down to
replace a space-cooler motor and to relleve plugging problems in the off-
gas system.

The power preparations included some system modifications shown to
ve required by operating experience and by continuing development and
analysis work. Remote maintenance techniques were tried and evaluated,
some special tests were performed, the operators were trained and guali-
fied for power operation, and the secondary containment was sealed and
shown to have an acceptably low leak rate.

The nuclear performance of the system at all powers up to 1 Mw was
highly satisfactory. Reproducible reactivity behavior and a lack of
gignificant cross contamination between the fuel and flush salts were
demonstrated, Dynamics tests at power showed that the reactor has a
slightly wider margin of stability than had been predicted from calcu~
lations. Preliminary results indicate that xenon poisoning may be lower
than was anticipated.

The performance of most of the equipment was satisfactory, but
substantial operational difficulty was caused by plugging of very small
openings in off-gas system components by organic material. This problem
was extensively investigated after the shutdown from 1 Mw. Other, less
serious problems included the freak failure of an electric motor inside
the secondary containment, activation of the corrosion inhibitor in the
treated cooling water, alr entrainment in the cooling water, and ex-
cessive radiation levels in a few remote areas. Solutions have been
developed for all the problems except the off-gas plugging, which is
still under study.

Formal design of the instrumentation and controls systems for the
MSRE was completed. Additions and modifications are now being made as
needed to provide additional protection, improve performance, or provide
more information for the operators.

The addition of a low-level BF; counting chamnel with control func-
tions, the addition of cadmium shielding in the neutron instrument pene-
tration, and changing reactor period interlock trip points were required
to obtain satisfactory performance of the nuclear Instrumentation system.
The remaining changes were mostly of secondary importance. Some sporadic
viii

difficulties were experienced with individual hardware items such as air
and helium valves and electronic switches. Most of the work done on the
instrument system can be characterized as debugging the original instal-
lation.

The data-logger—computer was put into operation in conjunction with
the reactor. Although the performance has not been up to expectations,
it is proving useful to the operation of the reactor experiment. A power
level simulator was assembled, and it operated satisfactorily for the
training of operators.

2. Component Development

 

The "fast thaw" requirement was eliminated in all freeze valves ex~
cept for those which control the emergency drain of the reactor and of
the coolant system. The operation of all the valves which might contain
sufficient radioactivity in the salt to produce radiolytic fluorine at
low temperature are now operated above 400°F, which is shove the threshold
for fluorine release.

The braided wire sheath cover for the convoluted hose of control rod
No. 3 was found to be severely torn about 2 ft below its upper end. The
cause was traced to a Jammed roller in the upper bend of the control rod
thimble. The roller was replaced, and the upper rod sheath was repaired.
There has been no further difficulty after several months of operation.

Control rod drive unit No. 3 was replaced because of a shift in the
remote position indication and because of a tendency for the lower limit
switch to stick. The shift of the indicated position was eliminated by
removing the excess slack in the chain, which had allowed the chain to
slip over the sprocket. The sticking lower limit switch is being cured
by replacing the return spring with a stronger one.

Modifications were made to the radiator door guide tracks and lock
mechanisms to allow for thermal distortion, found after the initial oper-
ation of the radiator doors at temperature. Alterations were made to the
limit switch system to prevent a damaging overtravel of the door in the
upper end of the travel.

A "loss-of-tension"” device was designed which will stop the radiator
door drive unit should the door support cables show any slack as the door
is being lowered. This arrangement is intended to prevent damage to the
support cable if the radiator door Jams, as well as to indicate a mal-
function.

Failure of the insulation on the electrical leads to the radiator
heaters was traced to excessive heat leakage into the area immediately
above the radiator. Changes were made to reduce the temperature in this
area, and electrical insulation with a higher temperature rating was in-
stalled.
ix

Several changes were made to the sampler-enricher to improve the
operation and safety of this system. Among these were the changes made
to the interlock circuit, which require that additional barriers be
present during certain critical operations, thereby assuring double con-
tainment at all times.

Forty samples were taken during runs 4 and 5, nine of which were
large 50-g samples for oxygen analysis. These larger samples caused
some difficulty until the capsule design was altered slightly to make it
hang straighter.

One of the operational valves developed a 20-cc/min helium leak
across one of the two sealing surfaces of the gate. Since this is one
of two valves in the line and the leak is clean buffer gas, the valve
was not replaced.

During the same period ten samples were removed from the coolant
gystem, two of which were the larger 50-g samples. The first sample
taken after an extended shutdown had a black film on it, which was ldenti-
fied as decomposed oil. Although there was oll in the general area the
exact source was not established. No films were found on subsequent
samples.

The design and installation of the fuel processing system sampler
is proceeding.

A system is being designed to permit analysis of the reactor off-gas
stream. It will contain:

1. a thermal conductivity cell for on-line indication of the gross con-
taminant level,

2. a chromatograph for quantitative determination of contaminant,

3. a refrigerated molecular sieve trap for isolation of a concentrated
sample for transfer to a hot laboratory for isotople analysis.

Estimates of the '3%Xe poison fraction for the MSRE were computed
as a function of several parameters. At 10 Mw the resulls indicate that
the poison fraction is 1.6%. It was found that the mass transfer coef-
ficient from the salt to the graphite is controlling the transfer and
that the properties of the graphite are not important.

The remote maintenance group gained more experience with the reactor
components during the period prior to power operation. Among these were
removing and replacing the pump rotary element and replacing the graphite
sampler agsembly. After a short period of power operation several oper-
ations were performed, using remote maintenance techniques, on & mildly
radicactive system.
The MSRE pump test facility was modified, and the prototype pump
was operated for periods of 165 and 166 hr at 1200°F Lo provide shake-
down of the spare fuel pump impeller and the spare coolant pump drive
motor. The spare rotary element for the fuel pump was modified to pro-
vide positive sealing against oil leakage from the shaft lower seal
catch basin into the system past the outside of the shield plug. The
drive motor containment vessel was redesigned, and the new design will be
used for the fifth drive motor vessel. Modified ejectors were installed
on the lubrication systems for the MSRE salt pumps, and the lubrication
pump endurance test was continued. The MK-2 fuel pump tank design was
completed and is being reviewed.

The PK-P molten-salt pump continues on endurance operation and has
operated for 22,622 hr. The pump containing the molten-salt bearing was
placed in operaticn, but the bearing seized after 1 hr of operation.

Efforts to improve the stability of the ultrasonic level probe in-
stalled in the MSRE fuel storage tank were continued without success.

Testing of a NaK~filled differential pressure transmitter which
Tailed in service at the MSRE was continued. Performance of the instru~
ment was improved by refilling with silicone oil but is still not satis-
factory.

Performance of the ball-float-type transmitter installed at the
MSRE continues to be satisfactory. Some difficulties were experienced
with a similar (prototype) transmitter on the MSRE pump test loop; how-
ever, these troubles were anticipated and corrected in the design of the
MSRE model.

Performance of the conductivity~-type level probes installed in the
MSRE drain tanks continues to be acceptable.

Observation of the performance of 110 single-point temperature-
alarm switches is continuing. Data obtained to date are insufficient to
determine whether set-point drift in these switches is excessive.

Testing of alternate trim material combinations for the helium con-
trol valves was terminated. Some additional valve failures have occurred.

Results of final checks indicate that errors in the coolant-salt-
radiator differential temperature signal, produced by thermocouple and
lead-wire mismatch, have been eliminated.

Drift testing of selected MSRE-type thermocouples was concluded.
The Tinal temperature equivalent drift values were between +4.7 and
+6 .4°F.

Performance of the MSRE temperature scanning system continues to be
satisfactory. Calibration drift appears to have been eliminated, and
reliability is much better than had been expected.

3. M3RE Reactor Analysis

 

For the purpose of on-line computation of control rod reactivity
with the TRW-340 data logger, a mathematical formula was fitted to the
rod~worth vs position curves obtained from calibration experiments. The
form of the expression used was obtained by applying a perturbation
technique to evaluate the integral expression for the rod reactivity. A
linear least-squares curve-fitting procedure was then used to evaluate
the unknown coefficients in the resulting functional expression. Close
agreement between calculated and experimental curves was obtained for
those configurations of shim and regulating rods of interest in monitor
ing the control rod reactivity during operation.

Theoretical calculations were made to estimate the influence of the
overall spatial distribution of 135%e absorbed in pores near the graphite
surfaces in the reactor core. The purpose was to determine spatial cor-
rection factors for use in the on-line calculation of 13%Xe reactivity
with the TRW-340. Based on an approximate model of the reactor core,
these calculations indicated that the equilibrium 135%¢ reactivity at 10
Mw 1s reduced by a factor of about 0.76 relative to the value obtained
from a "point" calculation. In addition, this correction was found to
depend on the time history of the power level. Results of calculations
are presented for step changes in power level, increasing to and de-
creasing from 10 Mw.

Part 2. Materials Studies

 

bo Metallurgy

Thermal convection loops made of Hastelloy N and type 304 stainless
steel have circulated molten fuel salt for 33,000 and 22,000 hr, re-
spectively, without incident. A (b—1% Zr loop circulating lead at 1400°F
with a 400°F A was found to produce columbium crystals by mass transfer.

Specimens of Hastelloy N and grade CGB graphite showed no detectable
changes as a result of 1100 hr exposure to molten flucride salts in the
MSRE core during the precritical, initial critical, and associated zerc-
power experiments.

The reactor control specimen rig, which will establish base-line
data by exposing graphite and Hastelloy N surveillance specimens to ape
proximately the operating conditions of the MRE except for radiation,
has been loaded with salt and is veing calibrated with the computer that
monitors the MSRE.

Metallographic examination of capsules from in-pile experiment MIR
47-6 showed no evidence of nitriding of the Hastelloy N. Uo apparent
xii

change in wall thickness or evidence of attack was observed, although an
unexplained change in the etching characteristics of the grain boundaries
at the surface was noted.

Development of methods of Joining graphite to metal has included:
(1) the design of a transition Joint to reduce shear stresses arising
from thermal expansion differences and (2) screening tests on potential
brazing alloys.

A small pipe of grade CGB graphite brazed to molybdenum satisfactorily
contained molten fluoride salts at 700°C under pressures of 50, 100, and
150 psig for periods of 100, 100, and 500 hr respectively. This is the
first of a series of tests of graphite-to~-metal joints to determine if
such joints are corrosion resistant and mechanically adequate for the re-
quirements of molten-salt breeder reactors.

A few samples of needle~coke graphite and isotropic graphite have
been obtained and are being evaluated to determine their suitability for
use in molten-salt breeder reactors.

The radiation-dsmage problems were evaluated for graphite in advanced
molten~salt reactors, considering growth rate, creep coefficient, flux
gradient, and geometric restraint as Important factors. The stress de-
veloped by differential growth in an isotropic graphite should not be
allowed to exceed the fracture strength of the graphite and thus cause
failures. The estimated life of graphite is at least five years before
failure from inability to absorb creep deformation. The major uncertainty
seems to be the ability of graphite to sustain doses of 2 X 1022 nvt withe
out loss of integrity.

Creep~rupture life of Hastelloy N was found to be less affected by ir-
radiation as the stress levels are lowered. The effects of irradiation
temperature on the postirradiation creep life of air-melted heats are un-
certain. Vacuun-melted heats show a large dependency on irradiation tem-
perature. Pretest heat treatment can improve the ductility of irradiated
specimens. The creep-rupture properties of structural material in the
MSRE appear to be better than originally predicted on the basis of linear
extrapolation of data for stress vs log of rupture time.

Experimental welds have been made to study methods of improving the
weldability of Hastelloy XN.

5. Chemistry

Three innovations have been introduced in the chemical analysis of
MSEE salts: a new end point for uranium titrations, a new method for
determining structural-metal ions, and a new method for oxide analyses.
Together they have given increased assurance that fuel conforms to the
inventory composition and that the chemical purity of the salt has been
maintained.
Examination of deposits believed to have been responsible for the
plugging of off-gas lines in the MSRE revealed the presence of oil and
polymer products presumed to have formed from oil. A negligivle amount
of salt was found.

The formula for the uranium-bearing crystals in the frozen fuel has
been found to be IiF-UF, rather than 7IiF-6UF,; as formerly supposed.

In a study of the physical chemistry of fluoride melts, vapor-pres-
sure measurements have been made for three compositions in the LiF-Bels
system. Because of vapor-phase association, the apparent volatility of
LiF increases with decreasing concentration of LiF in the melt. Methods
have been developed for predicting density, specific healt, and thermal
conductivity in molten fluorides.

The solubility of oxide in MSRE-related fluoride melts has been re-
evaluated with improved experiments. When Increasing amounts of ZrF,, as
present in the MSRE fuel, are added to flush salts, the capacity for
oxide first decreases, then increases.

Interest in reprocessing methods for MSBR fluorides has led to cone
tinuing studies of distillation and of chemical reduction as a means of
separating rare earths from fuels or protactinium from blankets. The
composition that yields MIRE barren solvent as distillate has been found;
this product distills, leaving the rare earths behind. Alloys of bismuth
containing a small amount of lithium have proved very effective Tor re-
ducing and extracting rare earths into a liguid-metal phase. Thorium has
been found effective as a reducing agent for removing protactinium from
blanket melts. Protactinium can also be removed on ZrOs.

The in-pile molten~salt loop experiment and associated auxiliary
equipment are being fabricated and assembled so that modifications to
beam hole HN-1 in the ORR and installation of equipment can begin in
April.

The precision and accuracy of the hydrofluorination method for de-
termining oxide in MSRE salts were established. The method was applied
to the analysis of nonradioactive samples taken during the startup of
the MSR; the results were in reasonable agreement with those obtained by
the KBrF, method. The hydrofluorination apparatus for the determination
of oxide in radioactive samples was fabricated and tested and is now being
installed in a hot cell.

Tonic iron and nickel were determined voltammetrically on a sample
of molten fuel withdrawn from the MSR. These measurements indicate that
the major fraction of iron and of nickel in the fuel 1s present in an
un~ionized state, presumably as finely divided metal. Also, a well-
defined voltammetric wave for the reduction U(IV) — U(III) was observed.
xiv

Efforts were continued on the development and evaluation of equip-
ment and procedures for analyzing radioactive MSRE salt samples. The
coulometric uranium procedure was modified to eliminate a negative bias.

Both flush- and fuel-salt samples were analyzed for U, Zr, Cr, Be,
F, Fe, Ni, and Mo. The analyses were routinely performed in the hot
cells of the High~Radiation-Ievel Analytical Laboratory.

The quality control program was continued during the past period.

The results obtained on synthetic solutions established more realistic
limits of error for the methods employed.

6. Molten-3alt Breeder Reactor Design Studies

 

Design and evaluation studies were made of thermal molten-salt
breeder reactors (MSBR) in order to assess their economic and nuclear
potential and to identify important design and development problems.

The MSBR reference design concept is a two-region, two-fluid system with
fuel salt separated from the blanket salt by graphite tubes. The energy
produced in the reactor fluid is transferred to a secondary coolant-salt
circuit which couples the reactor to a supercritical steam cycle. On-
site fluoride volatility processing is employed, which leads to low unit
processing costs and economic reactor operation as a thermal breeder.
The resulting power cost is estimated to be 2.7 mills/kwhr for investor-
owned utilities; the associated fuel cycle cost is 0.45 mill/kwhr
(electrical); the specific fissile inventory is 0.8 kg/Mw (electrical);
and the fuel doubling time is 21 years. Development of a protactinium
removal scheme for the blanket region of the M3BR could lead to power
costs of 2.6 mills/kwhr (electrical), a fuel cycle cost of 0.33 mill/kvhr
(electrical), a specific fissile inventory of 0.7 kg/Mw (electrical),
and a fuel doubling time of 13 years.

7. Molten-Salt Reactor Processing Studies

 

A close~coupled facility for processing the fuel and fertile streams
will be an integral part of a molten~salt breeder reactor system. The
fuel salt will be processed on a 40-day cycle. The uranium will be re-
moved from the carrier salt and fission products by fluorination, and the
carrier salt will be recovered from the fission products by a semicon-
tinuous vacuum distillation. Relative volatilities between lithiuan and
the rare earths have been measured to be 0,01 to 0.04 at 200 to 1050°C.
The reconstitution of the fuel salt, by combining the purified carrier
salt with the purified UFg, can be done by direct absorption of the UFg
in fuel salt which already contains some UF, and subsequent reduction of
the intermediate uranium fluoride to UF, with hydrogen. Experimental
tests showed rapid and complete absorption. The primary problems in con-
tinuous fluorination of the fuel salt to remove the uranium are corrosion
XV

and getting adequate mass transfer and countercurrent flow to assure good
recovery. Corrosion can probably be eliminated by the use of a layer of
frozen salt on the wall of the vessel. Experimental work with a small
countercurrent continuous fluorinator gave recoveries of 90 to 96% of the
uranium. Fluorination during the processing of the fuel from the MSRE
produces volatile chromium fluorides. These can be effectively trapped,
with negligible uranium losses, by use of sodium fluoride beds. A pre-
liminary design study has been made on a conceptual processing plant ine
corporating the above concepts. Among the problems which this study
illuminated were the complications from the handling of high-heat-~
generating materials. The fixed capital cost for the conceptual plant was
$5.3 million; the salt inventory cost was $0.196 million, and the direct
operating cost was $787,790.00 per year.
INTRODUCTION

The Molten-Salt Reactor Program is concerned with research and de-
velopment for nuclear reactors that use mobile fuels, which are solu~
tions of fissile and fertile materials in suitable carrier salts. The
program is an outgrowth of the ANP efforts to make a molten-salt reactor
power plant for aircraft and is extending the technology originated there
to the development of reactors for producing low-cost power for civilian
Uses.

The major goal of the program is to develop a thermal breeder re-
actor. Fuel for this type of reactor would be 233yw,, or 235UF, dissolved
in a salt of composition near 2LiF-BeF;. The blanket would be Th, dis-
solved in a carrier of similar composition. The technology being devel-
oped for the breeder is applicable to, and could be explolted sooner in,
advanced converter reactors or in burners of fissionable uranium and plu-
tonium that also use fluoride fuels. Solutions of uranium, plutonium,
and thorium salts in chloride and fluoride carrier salts offer attractive
possibilities for mobile fuels for intermediate and fast breeder reactors.
The fast reactors are of interest too but are not a significant part of
the program.

Our major effort is being applied to the development, construction,
and operation of a Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment. The purpose of this
Experiment is to test the types of fuels and materials that would be used
in the thermal breeder and the converter reactors and to obtain several
years of experience with the operation and maintenance of a small molten-
salt power reacbor. A successful experiment will demonstrate on a small
gecale the attractive features and the technical feasibility of these sys-
tems for large civilian power reactors. The MSRE operates at 1200°F and
atl atmospheric vressure and will generate 10 Mw of heat. Initially, the
fuel contains 0.9 mole % UF,, 5 mole % ZrF,, 29.1 mole % BeF,, and 65
mole % LiF, and the uranium is about 30% 2555." The melting point is
840°F, In later operation, we expect to use highly enriched uranium in
the lower concentration typical of the fuel for the core of a breeder.

In each case, the composition of the solvent can be adjusted to retain
about the came liquidus temperature.

The fuel circulates through a reactor vessel and an external pump
and heat-exchange system. All this equipment is constructed of Hastelloy
nN, a new nickel-molybdenum-chromium alloy with exceptional resistance
to corrosion by molten fluorides and with high strength at high tempera-
ture. The reactor core contains an assembly of graphite moderator bars
that are in direct contact with the fuel. The graphite Is a new material?
of high density and small pore size. The fuel salt does not wet the
graphite and therefore should not enter the pores, even at pressures well
above the operaling pressure.

Heat produced in the reactor is transferred to a coolant salt in
the heat exchanger, and the coolant salt is pumped through a radiator
to dissipate the heat to the atmosphere. A small facility is installed
in the MSRE building for occasionally processing the fuel by treatment
with gaseous HF and Fs.

Design of the MSRE was begun early in the summer of 1960. Orders
for special materials were placed in the spring of 1961. Major modifi-
cations to Building 7503 at ORNL, in which the reactor is installed,
were started in the fall of 1961 and were completed by January 1963.

Fabrication of the reactor equipment was begun early in 1962. Some
difficulties were experienced in obtaining materials and in making and
installing the equipment, but the essential installations were completed
so ‘that prenuclear testing could begin in August of 1964. The prenuclear
testing was completed with only minor difficulties in March of 1965.

Some modifications were made before beginning the critical experiments
in May, and the reactor was first critical on June 1, 1965. The zero-
power experiments were completed early in July. Additional medifica-
tions, maintenance, and sealing and testing of the containment were
required before the reactor began to operate at appreciable power. This
work was completed in December, and the power experiments were begun in
January 1966. The reactor had been operated for a short time at 1 Mw
at the time of this report. Further increases in power were delayed vy
difficulties with the off-gas system.

Because the MSRE 1s of a new and advanced type, substantial research
and development effort is provided in support of the design and construc-
tion. Included are engineering development and testing of reactor com-
ponents and systems, metallurgical development of materials, and studies
of the chemistry of the salts and their compatibility with graphite and
metals both in-pile and out-of-pile. Work is alsc being done on methods
for purifying the fuel salts and in preparing purified mixtures for the
reactor and for the research and development studies. Some studies are
being made of the large power breeder reactors for which this technology
1s being developed.

This report is one of a series of periodic reports in which we de-~
scribe briefly the progress of the program. ORNL-3708 is an especially
useful report because it glves a thorough review of the design and con-
struction and supporting development work for the MSEE. It also de-
scribes much of the general technology for molten-salt reactor systems.

Chronological Account

 

Preparations for operation at high power were completed, and the ex-
perimental program was resumed. The power ascension was interrupted at
1 Mw, however, by partial or complete plugging at several points in the
fuel off-gas system. The plugging materials were identified as organics,
probably the products of oil decomposition.

Figure 1.1 outlines the major activities in the period covered by
this report. A brief account follows; details are glven in later sec-
tions.

Two of the larger modification jobs scheduled before power opera-
tion, the coolant line anchor sleeves and the installation of new ra-
distor doors, were completed in August. Late that month, the assembly
of graphite and Hastelloy N survelllance specimens, which had been in
the core from the beginning of salt operation, was removed. While the
reactor vessel was open, inspection revealed that pleces were broken
from the horizontal graphite bar supporting the sample array. The pleces
were recovered for examination, and a new sample assembly, designed for
exposure at high power and suspended from above, was installed.

The fuel pump rotary element was removed in a final rehearsal of
remote maintenance and to permit inspection of the pump internals. It
was reinstalled after inspection showed the pump to be in very good con-
dition.

Tests had shown that heats of Hastelloy N used in the reactor vessel
had poor high-temperature rupture life and ductility in the as-welded
condition. The vessel closure weld had not been heat treated, so 1t was
heated to 1400°F for 100 hr, using the installed heaters, to improve these
properties.

At the conclusion of the heat treatment, the reactor cell was sealed
for the first time. The drain cell had already been sealed, and some of

the closure devices on containment penetrations had been tested. Now test-
ing of the containment provided by the reactor cell, drain cell, and vapor-
condensing system became the primary effort. After preliminary tests at
pressures up to 5 psig, the program was interrupted on October 21 to in-
stall Masonite sheets between the cell membranes and upper blocks to
modify the access opening over the core. Testing at 20 psig disclosed
many small leaks at penetrations, which were repaired (many while the
reactor cell was open for ten days for strain-gage measurements of pip-~

ing stresses). After the repairs, leakage rates were measured at 10,

20, and 30 psig. Extrapolation to 39 psig (the peak pressure in the
maximum credible accident) gave a leak rate of 0.4%/day, compared to
1.0%/day assumed in the safety analysis. Leakage rates at —2 psig (the
normal. operating pressure) were measured to serve as a reference during
subsequent operation. This program was completed on December 5.

Stresses in the reactor cell piping and vessels were calculated in
detail to permit evaluation of the service life of the Hastelloy N parts
under irradiation. Some adjustments of supports were made to minimize
stresses, after which the calculated stresses were acceptably low ex-
cept at the heat exchanger nozzles, where a complicated geometry made
calculations unreliable. The strain-gage measurements in early Novem-
ber showed tolerable stresses at this point also.

While the containment testing and strain-gage measurements were
under way, the operators and supervisors underwent further training
with emphasis on power operation. Classroom lectures were followed by
practice on a simulator which included the actual controls, instrumen-
tation, control rods, and radiator doors.t Examinations and certifica-
tion of qualified operators followed.

Early tests with the radiator holt and the exercises during simula-
tor practice showed that the operation of the radiator doors was unre-
liable. Four weeks in November and December were spent in modifying
and adjusting the door rollers, tracks, seals, and limit devices before
tests showed they would operate reliably hot or cold.

Air leakage from the radiator enclosure when the main blowers were
operated proved to be excessive, both from the standpoint of coolant-
cell ventilation capacity and because of excessive heating outside of
the enclosure. Hoods were installed, into which the radiator doors re-
tracted, and the sheet-metal enclosure was generally tightened and modi-
fied before leakage became acceptable. (Even after the improvements it
was necessary to supplement the cell exhaust with ducting to one annulus
blower to attain a negative pressure in the coolant cell.)

When the main radiator blowers were operated with the radiator hot,
air leaking from the top of the enclosure overheated electrical insula-
tion in that area. It was necessary to install ceramic insulation on
leads on top of the radiator and reroute the leads to cooler locations.
Ducting was also installed to redirect cooling air flow across the top
of the enclosure where the door hoods had blocked the original flow pat-
terns.

The radiator werk lasted from early November to mid-January, delay-
ing the filling of the coolant system and the start of power operation.
Ag soon as containment testing was finished, the instruments, con-
trols, and equipment were given the checkoubs required prior to startup.
The Tuel system was then heated, and flush salt was clrculated for three
days, Samples of the flush salt taken at this time were analyzed for
oxides by an improved, more reliable method. Results averaged less than
100 ppm, well below tolerable levels. (Evidently the measures taken to
avoid oxygen contamination while the reactor vessel and fuel pump were
open were effective.)

Fuel salt was charged into the loop, and the reactor was taken crit-
ical on December 20. Between then and January 18, when the coolant loop
was filled, nuclear experiments were restricted to powers below 25 kw.
Iven so, useful measurements were made on flux distributions in the
thermal shield and beside the reactor vessel, control rod shadowing ef-
fects, and zero-power kinetics of the nuclear system. At the same time,
numerous fuel-salt samples were analyzed, showing uranium in excellent
agreement with expectations, low oxlde ccncentration, and practically
no corrosion.

With the coolant system in operation, the power was raised to 100,
500, and then 1000 kw as heat was extracted at the radiator. Dynamics
tests and heat balances were conducted at each power. Ou January 23,
while the power was at 500 kw, the fuel pressure control valve {or its
filter) showed signs of plugging, but the situation cleared up in a few
hours. There was also evidence of an abnormal restriction in the egqual-
izing line between the fuel pump and the drain tanks. The next day the
reactor was taken to 1 Mw, and a few hours later signs of intermittent
plugging in the fuel off-gas line again appeared. It was established
then that the equalizing line was completely plugged. When 1t was also
discovered that the auxiliary vent line was almost completely plugged,
the reactor was taken subcritical. Efforts to blow out the plugs in the
equalizing line and the auxiliary vent line failed, and the fuel and
coolant loops were drained to shut down the reactor. (The systems were
kept hot, with helium circulating.)

The check valve in the vent line to the auxiliary charcoal bed was
removed, and the line was reconnected. Gag then freely passed through
the lines. The fuel drain cell was opened, and the flow-restricting
capillary in the equalizing line was removed. This line then proved to
be clear. The check valve and capillary were taken to the High-Radiation-
Level Examination Laboratory (HRIEL), where they were observed to contain
small aounts of intensely radicactive material. They were not plugged,
however.

Meanwhile the plugging of the fuel pressure control valve (or filter)
recurred. Blowing backward through the line did not clear the obstruc-
tion, so the assembly of valve and filter was removed. A new valve was
installed, and the assembly was replaced to see 1f it were open. (This
was simpler than flow testing the contaminated parts outside the sys-~
tem.) At first the pressure drop was acceptable, bub over a few hours,
excegsive pressure drop again developed. After the assembly was removed,
the new valve was proved to be elear, so the filter was taken to the
HRIEL for examination. The old pressure control valve was also cut open
and examined in the HRLEL after flow tests showed its Cy was a factor of
10

3 below its original value. There was some solid material in the pores
of the Filter, but the pressure drop across the filter was not as high
as it had apparently been while installed. Inspection showed that the
valve trim was coated with oll and varnish-like material.

The total amount of material in the valves and filter was quite
small. Therefore we decided to resume operations, using a filter with
larger pores (50 p instead of 1 pn) and controlling pressure with a hand
valve (Cy = 1.0) already in the line instead of the pressure control
valve (C 0.07). (The pressure control valve was eliminated.)

v
During the operation at significant power, activation of potassium

in the cooling water corrosion inhibitor had been more than expected.

While the reactor was shub down, the original corrosion inhibitor was -

replaced with 714 nitrite and borate, which would give only a small

amount of activity (tritium).

Also while the reactor was down, pressure drops across the charcoal
beds were measured. There had been intermitbtent indications of excessive
pressure drops during the 1-Mw operation and Just afterward, but when
measured before the next startup they were normal. Operators and ex-
tension handles on the charcoal-bed hand valves had been repaired during
this interval. (Tce, rust, and binding had prevented easy operation,
and setbscrews in two of the extensions had sheared.)

Operation was resumed, and fuel was circulated for 44 hr before the
power was raised to 1 Mw. It was necessary to gradually open the hand
valve being used for pressure control about 1/4 turn during this period
in order to hold the fuel pressure in the range of 4 to 6 psig. The
implication was that a small amount (perhaps 0.01 in.) of material had
built up on the valve trim. Within 3 hr after going to 1. Mw, the ap-
parent accumulation of material accelerated. The valve was adjusted to
maintain control, but a short time after making an unusually large ad~
Justment, the differential pressure across the charcoal bed and valves
suddenly increased, indicating blockage in those lines.

Just at this point, the motor on the space cooler in the fuel drain
cell failed. Rising temperatures in this cell then required that the
fuel be drained and secured so the cell could be opened.

The remainder of the period was spent in replacing the space cooler
motor and investigating the trouble in the off-gas system.

Analysis of Experiments

 

Reactivity Balance

The reactivity balance involves calculation of the effects of changes
in all known variables affecting reactivity. The net effect of changes
between any two times that the reactor is critical should be zero if
the calculations are accurate. Deviations from zero indicate elther
error 1n the measurements and calculations or some unforseen effect.
11

The reference conditions for the reactivity balance were established
in run 3 (the zero-power experiments which ended July 4, 1965). Between
then and the startup in December, cone variable changed significantly —
the 22°U concentration in the fuel. Because of uranium additions to the
circulating fuel, at the end of run 3 the 2337 concentration in the loop
was about 10% higher than that in the salt remaining in the drain bank.
Thus the drain and mixing at the end of run 3 caused a substantial de-
crease in 23°U concentration, but one that could be calculated. On the
other hand, the fuel loop was flushed at the end of run 3 and the be-
ginning of run 4, resulting in mixing into the fuel an amount of flush
salt which was probably small bub was not directly measurable. Before
criticality in run 4 the 2357 concentration was calculated, assuming no
dilution with flush salt. The change in concentration from run 3 was
converted into reactivity change, using the concentration coefficient
of reactivity that had been observed in the zero-power experiments .?

The resultant reactivity was converted to a predicted control-rod con-
figuration for criticality at 1200°F and zero power, using the control-
rod poisoning representation based on the rod calibrations. (Ses "MSRE
Reactor Analysis,” this report, for a discussion of the equation for rod
poisoning.) The predicted critical position of the regulating rod (rod
1) with the two shim rods withdrawn 34 in. was 24.7 in., and the observed
critical position was 23.3 in. This difference, equivalent to only 0.08%
ok fk, may be due to several factors, including (1) differences in temper-
ature measurement, (2) inventory errors at the end of run 3, and (3)
errors in the rod-poisoning calculation. The most important conclusion
to be drawn from this is that there was no significant dilution of the
fuel salt by the flush-salt operation.

Critical operation of the reactor during runs 4 and 5 provided an
opportunity for checking out some parts of the reactivity-balance cal-
culation. The computer-executed reactivity balance was not used be-~
cause (1) the accurate representation of control-rod poisoning had not
been incorporated into the program, (2) the calculation of xenon poison-
ing was not fully developed, and (3) there were indications of other
sysbvematic errors in the program that had not been resolved. However,
several manual calculations were made at very low powers where the fis-
sion product poisoning and fuel-burnup terms are insignificant. Some
calculations were also made at powers up to 1 Mv but without The xenon
and. samarium terms. :

To general, the zero-power reactivity balances showed a variation
of 0.02% 8k/k. This corresponds to a variation of *0.3 in. in the
critical position of the regulating rod or *3°F in system temperature
and probably represents the limit of accuracy of this portion of the
calewlation.

Calculations after up to 24 hr of operation at 1 Mw showed no mea-
surable change from the zero-power reactivity balances. Neglect of the
fission product terms should have resulted in a change of about ~0.2%
8k /k if the anticipated xenon behavior had occurred. This is much larger
than the scatter in the measurements, go one can conclude that the xenon
poisoning was actually much less than predicted.
12

The difference between indicated and actual position of control rod
3, which developed after the start of run 4 (see p. 54), was reflected
as a shift of about 0.05% &k/k in the zero-power reactivity balance.
This demonstrated the ability of the reactivity balance to show up small
changes, at least under simple conditions, that is, no fission product
poisoning and low power.

Power Calibration

One objective of the early power tests was to correlate the thermal
power of the reactor and the outputs of the various neutron sensing ele-
ments. The principal requirement of such a calibration is an independent
method for measuring The thermal or fission power of the reactor. Vari-
ous methods were used in the approach to 1 Mw with reasonably good agree-
ment.

The first approximation, used throughout run 3, was based on cal-
culations of the inherent (alpha-n) source in the fuel and subcritical
multiplication. The primary purpose of this calibration was to permit
positioning of the safety chambers so that they would provide a control-
rod scram at a few kilowatts and still not interfere with the planned
experiments at lower powers. Absolute accuracy was not required since
none of the experiments involved operation at powers where thermal ef-
fects were apparent.

A thermal-power calibration was made shortly after the start of run
4 av a nominal 25 kw. At this time, only the fuel loop wag full and
circulating; the thermal power was evaluated from the rate of tempera-
ture rise and the known heat capacity of the loop. This provided a
basis for subsequent operation at higher powers and, incidentally, showed
that the initial source-power calibration had been in error by only 8%.
A similar test was performed at higher power with both the fuel and
coolant loops full and circulating. However, the second test was di-
vided in two parts. First, the nuclear power was set at about 75 kw,
and 75 kw of electrical-heat input to the loop was turned off. These
operations did not lead to a steady temperature, but the change in tem-
perature slope with time before and after the increase to 75 kw was used
to correct the thermal power. The nuclear power was then increased by
50 kw, to 125 kw, and the increase in the rate of temperature rise was
measured. The thermal-power calibration from these two steps was within
5% of the 25-kw calibration.

Several overall heat balances were calculated with the nominal pu-
clear power at 1 Mw. The results in run 4 varied between 0.94 and 1.18
Mw, with an average value of 1.0L Mw. In run 5, the steady-state heat
balances at an indicated power of 1 Mw gave 1.19 © 0.02 My. The reagons
for thls apparent discrepancy have not been established.

Flux Measurements

Flux measurements were made in the neutron source tube to determine
if operation at power would regenerate the external neubroa source (Am-
13

Cm-Be) to a significant degree. The regeneration would take place as a
result of thermal-neutron captures in 241py (T1/2 = 462 years), which
would produce the more active 2420 (T1,2 = 162.5 days). The measure-
ments were made using cadmium-covered and bare copper folls to determine
the thermal-neutron flux at the permanent source position, an elevation
of 830 ft 8 in. The thermal flux at that point was found to be 3.8 X 107
neutrons cm? sec” * with the reactor at 1.02 kw. This extrapolates to
3.7 x 1011 neutrons cm™? sec”! at a power of 10 Mw. Using conservative
assumptions, it was calculated that the source strength will be kept at
an acceptable level for at least 1-1/2 years after power operation has
begun.

Flux measurements were also made in the reactor furnace (4 in. from
the reactor vessel wall) in the location later occupied by metallurgical
surveillance specimens. The measurements were made using gold and copper
foils. The foils were sealed in a stainless steel envelope from which
alr nad been purged to protect the copper from oxidation during the irra-
diation at 1200°F. Fluxes were measured along a vertical line 80 in.
long. The peak flux (at approximately the core midplane), extrapolated
to a power of 10 Mw, was 7 X 1012 neutrons cm”? sec”. Fast and thermal
contributions to this flux were 4.8 X 10%? neutrons cm™® sec™ and 2.3 X
10%2 neutrons cm? sec” respectively.

MERE Dynamic Tests

Description of Dynamic Tests

 

A muber of dynamic tests were performed during operation at zero
power and subsequently at power levels up to 1 Mw. The purpose of these
tests was to investigate the inherent stability of the system, as well
as to evaluate the mathematical models and the parameters that were use
to predict its dynamic characteristics.

The inherent stability of the system (i.e., without automatic con-~
trol) was the subject of an exhaustive theoretical analysis? in which it
was concluded that the reactor would be stable at all powers and that
its stability characteristics would improve as the power level increased.
Tests made on the reactor operating without servo control at power levels
of 75 kw, 465 kw, and 1 Mw confirmed these predictions, as shown in Fig.
1.2, which shows the response of the power to arbitrary perturbations.
The improvement in the natural damping characteristics and the decrease
in the period of oscillation with increasing power level are clearly
shown. Figure 1.3 shows a comparison of the experimental and theoretical
ceriods of oscillation.

A subject of considerable interest during the MSRE development was
whether or not the reactor power would "wallow" when operating without
servo control. Wallowing would occur if the system were unstable or if
random perturbations in reactivity or cooling load induced lightly damped
power oscillations.
but the power level perturbations were less than +5%.

At both 75 and 465 kw some wallowing was observed,

1-Mw case, however, the. bulk of the cooling was by forced convection, and
the power level fluctuations were reduced considerably. Thus, at higher
powers, negligible inherent low-frequency neutron level fluctuations can
be expected since the load will be steadier and the inherent damping of
the system even greater.

Frequency Response Tests

 

Both pseudorandom binary tests and pulse tests were carried ont in
order to determine the frequency response of the system. The pseudorandom
binary tests consisted of specially selected periodic series of positive
and negative reactivity pulses. The advantages of this type of signal
for frequency response testing in the MoRE are:

1. The signal may be generated with standard reactor hardware. The
sequences were generated using the MSRE digital computer and a portable
analog computer to control the position of a regulating rod.

2. A large number of frequencies may be analyzed in a single test,
with less time required to carry out the experiments compared with that
required for oscillator tests, which analyze cone frequency at a time.

3. The location and relative amplitudes of the harmonics of the
input signal may be adjusted by varying the basic pulse or "bit time"
and the number of bits in the sequence.

4. The signal power is concentrated in specific harmonic Irequen~
cies. This gives a better effective signal-to-noise ratio than that in
nonperiodic signals with a continuum of frequencies.

5. The average value of the perturbation is essentially zero, re-
sulting in a small net upset of the system.

Pseudorandom binary tests were run at power levels of 100 w, 75 kw,
465 kw, and 1 Mw. The particular sequences and thelr duration were
selected zo that the expected low-frequency resonance in the Trequency
response amplitude? could be identified. Sequences with 19, 63, 127, and
511 bits per sequence were used. As will be shown below, this type of
test worked quite satisfactorily.

Single reactivity pulse tests were also run, but the resulting
transients were inadequate for Irequency response analysis. Since the
signal strength of a single pulse is distributed continuously over a wide
frequency range, pulse tests require a comparatively low-noise signal.

The low-frequency load perturbations seen at low power reduced the signal-
to-noigse ratio to an unacceptable value in the frequency range of inferest
(0.002 to 1 radian/sec). Pulse and step response tests are planned at
higher power levels, where the conditions should be more favorable.

Implementation of Pseudorandom Binary Tests

 

The pseudorandom binary reactivity input required a very precisely
controlled series of regulating rod insertions and withdrawals. Since
the frequency range of interest was from about 0.002 to 1.0 radian/sec,
the rod jogger was designed so that sequences with a bit time of 3 to 5
sec could be run for as long as 1 hr. The rod jogger system, which re-
quired no special-purpose hardware, consisted of a hybrid computer con-
troller shown schematically in Fig. 1.4. The portable EAT-TR-10 analog
computer was used to control the bit time and the rod drive motor "on"
times for the insert and. withdraw commands. The MSRE digital computer
was programmed Lo contro the sequencing of the pulse train by means of
a shift-register egori thm. * The number of bits in the sequence could

N

be varied over a range between 3 and 33,554,431 bits.

The rod Jogger system performed extremely well, as it was able to
position the rod with an accuracy of about +0.01 in. (corresponding to
+0.0005% 8k/k) out. of 1/2 in. peak-to-peak rod travel for over 500
insert-withdraw operations.

The analog computer was also used to amplify and filter the rod-
pesition and power~level signals prior to digitizing. Throughout the

Results

The results of the MSRE frequency response tests for power levels
up to 1 Mw are shown in Figs. 1.6 to 1.13, along with previously published
theoretical predictions.? The experimental results indicate a consist
tently lower magnitude ratio for (81/1) / (8%/%g) than the theoretical
predictions at all frequencies and at all power levels. However, the
shapes of the experimental curves clearly are consistent with predictions.
Work is now in progress to determine the reasons for the differences.
Fortunately, the theoretical work in ref. 3 included calculations of the
sensitivity of the frequency response to changes in numerous system
parameters. This information is proving to be valuable in establiching
which system parameters to suspect as responsible for the discrepancies.

Farly work suggests that the zerco-power discrepancies are due to the
effect of fuel-salt plenums above and below the core. These regions in-
crease the cffective volume of the core. An increase of the effective
core volume to include one-third of the upper and lower plenums in the
theoretical model gives agreement with experimental results.

The at-power theoretical results obtained with the increased ef-
fective core volume agree with experimental results at higher frequencies
for the at-power runs, but the discrepancies in magnitude ratio remain
at low frequencies around the peak. The computed sensitivities indicate
that the frequency response in thls range is most sensitive to power
level, Ng, fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity, Cos and fuel heat

capacity, (MC)

ole Furthermore, the system equations indicate that these

parameters appear as a quantity No%/ (MC)... It was found that excellent

agreement between theoretical and experimental results may be obtained at
all frequencies and all three power levels if, in the theoretical calcu-
Jations, the increased effective core volume is used and the quantity

NooL./ (MC). is increased by a factor of 1.5 to 2. The plausibility of

such changes is now being examined.

Temperature Response Test

 

In order to get a more accurate estimate of the fuel temperature
coefficient of reactivity, the hot-slug transient test as reported
earlier’ was modified and rerun in January 1966. In this test the re~
actor power level was controlled by the flux servo at 100 w with the
fuel loop circulating and the coolant loop stagnant. After heating the
stagnant coolant salt about 20°F hotter than the fuel salt, the coolant
pump was started, producing a hot slug of fuel in the heat exchanger
which was subsequently introduced into the core. In this test, then,
the change in reactivity was due entirely to the change in temperature,
and the rod-induced reactivity required to keep the reactor critical was
approximately equal and opposite to that due to the fuel and graphite
temperature change. Since the graphite responds slowly to changes in
fuel temperature, the immediate effects on reactivity can be attributed
to the fuel temperature coefficient alone. Further corrections have yet

to be applied to the results of the test, but a preliminary estimate of
—4.7 x 107? (°w)~1 has been obtained. This compares favorably with the
predicted value of —4.84 x 1077 (°F)~! used in the theoretical calcu-
lations.

The transfer function of reactor outlet temperature response to
changes in reactor inlet temperature was alsc calculated from this test,
and the plot of magnitude ratio vs frequency is shown in Fig. 1.14. Note
that the experimental curve indicates much greater attenuation over most
of the frequency range shown. This is probably due to higher~than-ex-
pected rates of heat transfer to the graphite, since experimental mixing
studies’ indicated that there is very little attenuation due to mixing
in the frequency range below O.1 radian/sec. Reasons for this discrepancy
are being studied.

Systems Performance

Off-Gas System

Some difficulty with plugging and vartial restrictions in the MSRE
off-gas systems has been encountered at various times in the operation
of the reactor systems. In the past these obstructions have developed
at in-line filters and pressure-control valves with extremely small flow
passages. During early operations, the plugging of filters was attributed
to having filters with inadequate flow areas to accommcdabe the material
to be removed from the gas streams. (For example, the original filter
in the coolant off-gas line, 528, was a tubular element only 1 in. long
by 1/2 in. in diameter.) The plugging of valves appeared to be a re-
sult of filters which were too coarse to remove all the particles that
were capable of causing plugs.

During shutdown which followed the zero-power experiments (run 3),
larger filters, capable of removing particles greater than 1 pu in di-
ameter, were installed ahead of the pressure~control valves in both the
24,

fuel and coolant off-gas lines. The fuel-system pressure-conbrol valve
(Pov 522), which had exhibited some erratic behavior in rua 3, was tested
and found to have the same pressure-drop characteristics that it had when
first installed. This valve was reinstalled for the next operation of
the reactor. No further difficulties were encountered with the coolant
off-gas system, but several problems developed in the fuel system. (See
Fig. 1.15 for a simplified flowsheet of the fuel off-gas system.)

The performance of the fuel off-gas system was satisfactory during
the subcritical and low-power (up to 25 kw) operation of the reactor in
December 1965 and January 1966. The first indication of difficulty in
this run (run 4) occurred on January 23 with the reactor power at 500 kw.
The total integrated power accumulated up to this time was about 3 Mwhr.
At that time the system pressure began to rise slowly, indicating either
a restriction in the vicinity of PCV 522 or a malfunction of the valve.

(A routine check of system pressure interlocks on the previous day had
indicated normal behavior of all components.) Shortly after the start

of this pressure transient, the response of the drain-tank pressures
indicated an abnormal restriction at a capillary flow restrictor in line
521, the fuel-loop-to~drain-tank pressure equalizing line. The excess
pressure in the fuel system was relieved by venting gas through HCV 533

to the auxiliary charcoal bed umtil the restriction at PCV 522 was cleared
by operating the valve several times through its full stroke. These opera-

auxiliary charcoal bed, apparently at HCV 533. The reactor was made sub-

Satisfactory pressure control was maintained for about 24 hr, but
the plugging at HCV 522 recurred shortly afber the reactor power was
raised to L Mw. Again, the operation of this valve through its full
gtroke was effective in relieving at least part of the restriction.
However, on this occasion, evidence of restrictions at the charcoal-bed
inlets began to appear. These restrictions were bypassed by publbing
the two spare charcoal~bed sections (24 and 2B) in service and closing
the inlet valves to the two that were restricted (1A and 1B). Within
sbout 6 hr the inlets of beds 24 and ZB also plugged. When the pre-
viously plugged beds were checked, at least one was found to be clear
and off-gas flow was reestablished through bed 1B. The manipulation of
the charcoal-bed inlet valves revealed substantial mechanical difficul-
ties with the manual operators. These were caused by misalignment of
extension handles and corrosion due to weather exposure and resulted in
two of the valves becoming inoperative.

The combination of difficulties in the off-gas system resulted in
a reactor shutdown to correct the conditions. The restrictions in the
equalizing line (521) and the auxiliary vent line (533) were relieved
by removing the capillary (FE 521) and a check valve (QV 533) respec-
tively. The valve and filter assembly, and a second valve that had been
tried briefly, were removed from line 522. The original valve and the
filter were subsequently subjected to detailed examinations which are
described in "Component Development,” this report. Pressure-drop meas-
urements showed a higher pressure drop by a factor of 3 to 4 in the
valve and a factor of 10 in the filter. However, the observed restric-
tions, particularly in the case of the filter, were not high enough to
account for the observed pressure behavior in the operating system.

While the reactor was shut down, several measurements were made of
the pressure drop across individual sections of the charcoal beds.
Measurements made shortly after the shutdown showed essentially normal
pressure drops for three of the four sections. The pressure drop across
the fourth section (1B) was about 60% higher than that across the others.
(These measurements include the pressure drops across the inlet and out-
let valves of each bed section.) Although nothing was done to correct
this condition, measurements made just before the next startup (run 5)
showed that all four sections had essentially identical, normal pressure
drops. Mechanical repairs had been made tc the operating mechanisms of
the valves, but these did not affect the flow characteristics. Meagure-
ments were also made of the pressure drop across the auxiliary charcoal
bed; no abnormalities were observed there.

The preparations for the next startup included installation of a
large, relatively coarse (50-u) filter and a large, open hand valve at
the PCV 522 location. This arrangement eliminated the small, easlly
plugged passages associated with PCV 522, and it appeared that the filter
would still remove any particles large enough to plug valve 522B, which
was to be used for system pressure control. (satisfactory manual pres-
sure control using valve 522B had been demonstrated during the shutdown. )
26

In the next operation of the fuel loop (run 5), fuel salt was cir
culated for 44 hr with the reactor subcritical or at very low power
(100 w) before the power was raised. The evidence is not conclusive, but
there was some indication of an increase in flow resistance at valve
522B during this time. Shortly after the power was raised to 1 Mw,
the increase in flow resistance at 522B accelerated sharply. Frequent
adjustment of the valve was required to maintain reasonable pressure
control. The restriction at the charcoal beds which occurred after
one such adjustment developed quite rapidly and resulted in almost com-
plete plugging of the two beds that were in service (1A and 1B). After
the reactor drain, which was required because of the failure of the
space-cooler mobor, it was determined that the auxiliary charcoal bed
was also restricted. This bed comes into service automatically during
a drain as a hackup to relieve any excess gas pressure. The helium in
the fuel system was then released through the two standby charcoal beds.

Detailed investigations after the shutdown showed that the charcoal-
bed restrictions were probably at the inlet valves. Valve 621, the in-
let valve to bed 1B, was removed for examination in the HRIEL. The re~
sults of these examinationg are described in the section entitled "Com-
ponent Development." The pressure drop across bed 1B with valve 621 in
place was very much higher than normal. With the valve out, the pres-
sure drop was much lower but still higher than for a normal, unrestricted
bed. An excess of helium was then forced through the hed for a few min-
utes, and the pressure drop suddenly decreased. Subsequent pressure-drop
measurements under controlled conditions gave values wnich were normal
for an unrestricted bed.

Several gas samples were taken from the fuel loop during this shut-
down in an effort to identify some of the plugging constituents. For
several days after the drain, all helium flow through the fuel system
was stopped, and the helium in the loop was circulated at ~1100°¢. The
helium in the off-gas holdup volume (170 liters) was stagnant at about
122°F. Three successive pairs of samples were then trapped from the
discharge of the holdup volume; each pair of sample traps consisted of
a pipe coil at liquid-nitrogen temperature followed by a U-tube filled
with molecular sieve material, also at ligquid-nitrogen temperature. The
first pair of samples was isolated from the gas that had been in the hold-
up volume by displacing it through the traps with helium from the fuel
loop. The helium which entered the holdup volume during this displace-
ment was presumed to be representative of the material circulating in the
loop. A second displacement through another pair of traps was used to
isolate material from that gas. For the third pair of samples, the re-
actor cell temperature was allowed to rise to heat the off-gas holdup
volume to 173°F before the gas was passed through the traps. The pur-
pose of this was to see If any additional material was released from
the holdup volume by the increase in temperature. Analysis of the samples
has not yet been completed because of the high activity associated with
them.

Since particulate matter originating at the fuel pump was regarded
as one possible cause of plugging in the off-gas system, the main fuel
off-gas line (522) was opened at the fuel pump for visual inspection.
Small amounts of gray-green powdery material were found between the faces
of the flanges that were opened, but no deposits were seen in the part
of the holdup volume that could be inspected. Samples of the solid ma-
terial and swabs of the holdup volume were removed for analysis.

Additional work to he performed before the next startup includes:
1. a blowoub of the holdup volume to remove any loose malberlal,

2. design, fabrication, and installation of a new filter—control-valve
assembly at PCV 522, and

3. replacement of several valves in the system with valves having larger
trim,

Salt-Pump 0il Systems

 

Botrained gas in the circulating oil tends to accumulate in the
volute of the standby oil pump. From the beginning of MSRE operation,
it was necessary to prime the standby pump frequently to keep it ready
for operation. (Priming was done routinely once a shift.) Observations
in a development loop showed that entrainment and frothing in the res-
ervolr were due to the action of a jet pump used to scavenge oil from the
bearing housing (using shield plug oil flow to drive the jet) and agl-
tation of oil by the shaft and bearings .® In September 1965, the jets
on the fuel and coolant pumps were replaced with less powerful Jets to
decrease entrainment, After this modification, it was possible to re-
duce the frequency of priming the standby pump to once a week in the
fuel oil system; on the coolant lube oll system It was necessary to con-
tinue as before.

After the jets were changed it was found that changes in fuel-pump
bearing-oll flow or reservoir pressure caused changes in reservolr level,
apparently because of holdup of oil in the salt-pump motor cavity. Oil
from the bearing housing can enter the motor cavity elther by leakage
past the upper seal or through a passage comecting the motor cavity to
the area between the two shaft bearings. Apparently an excess of flow
to the bearing housing causes oll tc be forced up into the motor cavity.
Although the breather line affords a return to the oil reservoir, it has
been found that once the oil collection veging in the motor cavity it
wsually continues until either the oil system is shut down completely or
the bearing flow is reduced to below normal. An increase in oil flow
to the bearing housing from the normal 4 gpm to 5 gpm causes a level de-
crease in the oil reservoir of over 2 gal. (Much more than this could
collect without reaching the motor, but normally action is taken to stop
collection at less than a gallon.)

ITeakage past the lower seal drains to the oll cateh tank, which is
equipped with a level indicator and which is periodically drained to the
waste oll receiver. After the installation and calibration of a siphon
tube in the fuel-pump oil catch tank in November, oil wag not added to
bring the level indicator on scale. The fuel-pump lower-seal leak rate
during the months of December and January is therefore nob known pre-
cigely. However, when oil was deliberately added to the oil catch tank
28

in February, it took 900 cc to bring the level instrument on scale. Tae
seal leakage evidently had been very low, because this volume is very near
that calculated to £111 the empty pipe from the oil catch tank to the drain
valve alt the waste oll receiver. After the oll catch tank level indicator
was brought on scale, the indicated leak rate was approximately 2 cc/day.
The coolant-salt-pump lower-seal leakage measured during January and

most of February was zero. Near the end of February a leak rate of ap-
proximately 4 cc/day began.

The levels in the oll reservoirs are recorded roubinely once a
shift. As was seen above, the amounts of oil held up in the motor
cavities vary with operating conditions, and these cause variations in
the oil reservoirs. But there has been no reason why this variable
holdup should show any long-term trend. Therefore, the reservoir levels
recorded over a period of weeks should reveal changes in oil inventories.
Figure 1.16 is a plot of the fuel-pump 0il reservoir levels from December
1965 through February 1966, when the oil system was in continuous opera-
tion. It is apparent that leakage was less than can be measured by this

ethod. The coolant-pump oil reservolr level showed similar behavior
except that the fluctuations were smaller (probably reflecting less motor-
cavity holdup).

encountered during this report period were neutron activation of the cor-
rosion inhibitor and interruptions of flow through the thermal shield
slides.

Activation. During power operation in run 4, induced activity in
the treated water rose to an unexpectedly high level. Extrapolation of
observed radiation levels indicated that at 10 Mw, gamna radiation near
the heat exchanger in the diesel room would be about 400 mr /hr; similar
levels would exist in the water room. The activity proved to be 1l2.4-hr
42K produced in the corrosion inhibitor (2000 ppu of a 75% potassium ni-
trite, 25% potassium tetraborate mixture). The level indicated that the
average flux in the system (bout 80% of which is included in the thermal
shield) was equivalent to about 7 X 100 thermal neutrons cm™? sec”! at
10 Mw.

A survey of possible cation replacements for potassium led to the
choice of lithium, highly enriched in the 714 isotope to minimize tritium
production. An adequate amount of lithium nitrite solution was prepared
commercially by ion exchange from potassium nitrite and lithium hydroxide.
After the 4000-gal treated-water system was diluted with demineralized
water to reduce the potassium from 800 to 3 ppm, the desired inhibitor
concentration was attained by adding i nitrite, boric acid, and 11
hydroxide.

When the reactor was next operated at power, in run 5, objectionable
activation again occurred, this time due to 1.0 ppm of sodium which had
evidently come in with the demineralized water from the ORNL facility.
Condensate was produced at the MSRE with less than 0.1 ppm of sodium,
and this was used to dilute the sodium in the treated-water system to
0.3 ppm. The concentrations of sodium and ®Li are now low enough so that
shielding and zero-leakage containment of the water system will not be
necessary.

Flow Interruptions. On several occasions flow through the thermal
shield slides stopped. Each time it was found that when the water supply
line was disconnected and water was allowed to flow backward through the
slides, considerable amounts of alr came out with the water. The con-
clusion wag that air could accumulate in the longest slide until the
head exceeded the pressure available to cause flow. (This should be im-
possible if the piping in the slide were installed as designed. ) Vent-
ing the inlet line restored the flow, and provisions were made to fa-
cilitate venting. The source of the alr was evidently a vortex in the
surge tank which occurred when the level was low. After the flow through
the surge tank was drastically reduced (it had been about 30 om) there
was no recurrence of the flow interruptions.

Secondary Containment

 

The secondary containment, that is, the envelope surrounding the
reactor and drain-tank cells, was tested and pub into service for the
first time during this report pericd. The testing procedure followed
generally the MSRE Operating Procedures, Sect. 4E.7 This procedure in-
30

cludes testing of individual closure devices on lines penetrating the

of the overall leakage rate.

All lines carrying helium, air, or water into the cells are equipped
either with check valves or block valves actuated by radiation monitors.
All. of these valves were tested, in place wherever possible; otherwise
they were removed and bench-tested. West pressures were 20 psig or more,
and leakage rates were required to meet conservative criteria. This work
was done concurrently with maintenance before the cells were closed.

eaks which occurred in the cooling-water system were mostly in the
check valves. These were the result of foreign particles, apparently
washed out of the system and trapped between the sliding and moving parts
of the valves. Two hard-seated valves in the treated-water system had
to be replaced even though the seats were lapped in an effort to get them
to seal. One was a check valve with a swinging check, in a water line
between the surge tank and condensate tank, and the other was a spring-
leaded hand valve on top of the surge tank, which has to contain air.
They were replaced with soft-seated valves. The leakage rates on water-
containing valves were determined by collecting the leakage, and a flow-
meter was used to measure air leakage through valves on top of the surge
tank.

The majority of the valves in the helium system of both primary and
secondary containment had satisfactory leak rates. “Those which had ex-
cessive leakage were check valves and were found to have damaged O-rings
and/or foreign particles, usually melal chips from machining, in them.
After cleaning and installing new O-rings, they were satisfactory. Many
of the check valves had to be removed from the system to pressurize them.
After reinstalling, the lines were pressurized and the fittings were
checked with a helium leak detector. Leakage rates through the valves
were determined by a flowmeter or by displacement of water in a calibrated
tube.

The instrument-air-line block valves with Tew exceptions were found
to be satisfactory; however, numerous tube fitlings were found to be
leaking by checking with leak-detector solution when the lines were
pressurized to check the valves. Several quick disconnects on air lines
inside the reactor cell and drain-tank cell were found Lo be leaking when
checked with leak-detector solution and were repaired. These leaks do
not constitute a leak in secondary containment, since each line has a
block valve outside the cell; bub a leak here does affect the cell leak
rate when air pressure is on the line to operate the valve.

The butterfly valves in the 30-in. line used for ventilating the
cells during meintenance operations were first checked by pressurizing
between them. The leakage measured by a flowmeter was excessive, and
the valves had to be removed from the system to determine the cause.
There was considerable dirt on the rubber seats, and one was cub; these
seats were cleaned and repaired. We found that the motor drive units
would slip on their mounting plates by a small amount, thus causing a
slight error in the indicated position of the valve. Dowels were in-
stalled in the mounting plates to prevent this. Small leaks were also
31

found around the pins which fasten the butterfly to the operating shaft;
these leaks were repaired with epoxy resin. The line from the thermal-
shield rupture disks to the vapor-condensing systems has numerous threaded
joints that leaked badly when pressurized with nitrogen. Fach joint was
broken, the threads were coated with epoxy resin, and the joint was re-
made. All joints were leaktight when rechecked with leak-detector solu-
tion.

When closing the cells, all membrane welds were dye checked. After
completion of the membrane welding, alternate top blocks were installed,
and the cells were pressurized to 1 psig to leak check all menbrane welds
with leak-detector solution. No leaks were found in the welds. The re-
actor access cover plate, which has a double O-ring seal, was found to
be tight by pressurizing between the O-rings.

With the cells at 1 psig, all penetrations, pipe Joints, tube fit-
tings, and mineral-insulated (MI) electrical cable seals subjected to
this pressure were checked with leak-detector solution. Numerous leaks
were found in tube fittings and ML cable seals, and the leak rate was
about 4500 £t3/day, indicating a major leak. Many of the small leaks
were stopped by simply tightening the threaded parts of the seal. How-
ever, the leak rate was still about 4500 ft3/day.

The cells were then pressurized to 5 psig, and leak hunting con-
tinued. Three large leaks were located: one in the sleeve of line 522,
the off-gas line from the pump bowl to the carbon beds, under the bent
house floor, another in an instrument air line to valve HCV 523, and
another from the vapor-condensing system to the steam domes and out to
the north equipment service area through a line that was temporarily
open. All penetrations, tube fittings, and MI cable seals were again
checked with leak-detector solution. Many MI cable seals which had not
leaked at 1 psig were found to be leaking, and some of those which had
been tightened and sealed at 1 psig now leaked.

The hook gage being used to monitor the leakage rate along with
conventional pressure gages did not work properly, and the trouble was
found to be the result of extremely small leaks in the tube fittings on
the reference volume side of the system. This and tempersture changes
in the coolant drain-tank cell and special equipment room caused appre-
ciable difficulty in determining the leaksge rate. The piping to the
hook gage was evenbually replaced with virtually all welded tubing.
Temporary closures were put on the special equipment room, and the door
entering the coolant drain-tank cell was kept closed as much as possible.
These measures considerably improved the reliability of the data.

The MI cable seals as a group accounted for a large percentage of
the remaining leaks. Many were sealed by tightening, but many of them
required tightening more than once. As a result, several of the gland
nubs split and soldering was required. All large leaks were sealed or
greatly reduced, and many of the small leaks were stopped. To stop
these and other small leaks which may not have been located, all MI cable
seals were coated with epoxy resin at the seals outside of the cells.
Teflon tape, used extensively on MI cable seals, other threaded pipe,
and tube fittings, did nct perform satisfactorily in providing a gas
seal.
32

After stopping or reducing the leaks in the MI cable seals and in-
strument air lines, testing was begun at 10, 20, and 30 psig. At these
higher pressures, large leaks were located in both component coolant pump
dome flanges by leak-detector solution, and one of them was audible. To
correct these leaks, the width of the gasket was reduced to increase the
loading pressure on the gasket. All penetrations, MI cable seals, tube
fittings, and external parts of valves which are part of the secondary
containment were checked with leak-detector solution at each of the above
pressures.

In each of these tests, the containment system was pressurized to
a specific pressure. Then all gas additions and controlled exhausts
were gtopped, and the leak rate was measured by the change in pressure
corrected for changes in temperature. The calculated leakage rates are
presented in Fig. 1.17.

CONTAINMENT PRESSURE (psig)

Fig. 1.17. Pressure Dependence of the Leakage Rate of the MSRE
Secondary-Contalnment Vessel for Possible Flow Regimes. Normalized to
the maximum allowable leakage rate under MCA conditions.
The leakage rate ls acceptable if it is 19% per day of the contained
gases under the conditions of the maximum credible accident. This rep-
resents a leakage rate of about 430 scfd at 39 psig and 250°F. With this
as the condition of maximum leakage rate, the curves in Fig. 1.17 relate
the leakage rate to system pressure for various flow regimes thal can
exist (see ref. 1). Also shown is a highly conservative linear relation-
ship for leakage rate vs pressure. The data taken during the leak-rate
tests at 10, 20, and 30 psig are all well within the bounds of these
curves; the in~leakage rate at —2 psig is acceptable for all but the
linear relationship. Although the data at —2 psig indicate the contain-
ment is inadequate for the linear extrapolation, a comprehensive exami-
nabion of the data clearly indicated that the leakage rate was acceptably
low.

Core Access Opening. Convenient access to the control-rod drives
and the core accegs flange is had by removing a 40-in.-diam plug in a
stheel-Llined hole in a lower shield block. Originally a flange on the
upper rim of the hole liner was welded to the cell membrane, and a bolted,
gasketed cover plate completed the containment. This abtachment of the
mexbrane to a lower block presented a problem which became apparent dur-
ing testing and which led to modification. Because of their greatb weight,
the upper blocks must be supported at thelr ends, not by the lower blocks.
To ensure this, there 1s necessarily some clearance between the upper
blocks and the membrane, which normally lies on the lower blocks. When
the cell is pressurized, therefore, the membrane lifts up until it coon-
tacts the upper blocks. This it was free to do everywhere except around
the access opening, where 1t was fastened to the flange. Analysis showed
that this situation would produce excessive stresses when The cell was
pressurized for leak testing. Redesign of the liner or flange was im-
practical, so the membrane was cut loose from the flange and an overlap-
ping patch was welded on the membrane. This patch must now be cut off
whenever access is required.

Vapor-Condensing System. Installation of instrumentation and shield-
ing on the vapor-condensing system was completed, and the system was leak-
tested before water was added. Shielding consists of earth having a mine
imum thickness of 4 £t on top of the gas storage tank. This bank is just
inside the area fence along the HFIR access road, and at least 8 €t of
earth was provided on the road side to give complete protection to passers-
by under the worst conditions. Before the tanks were covered, all pene-
trations were helium leak-tested and found to be tight. Then during the
reactor cell leak test, the vapor-condensing system was leak-tested at
30 peig, and a leakage rate of only 5.5 £42 /day was measured from the
6800-£13 system. After the leak test, the vapor-condensing tank was
filled with water to the proper level, placing the system in readiness
for operation.

 

Ventilation of Coolant Cell. The cell housing the coolant-salt
system is connected to the bullding ventilation system by a duct which
exhausts 5500 cfm of air. This was enough to maintain a negative pres-
sure in the area until the radiator blowers were put into operation. Then
air leakage from the radiator enclosure exceeded the cell exhaust capacity.
Even after considerable work on the enclosure, the leakage was too much.

 
34

To alleviate the situation, the inlet of the south annulus blower was con-
nected to the coolant drain-tank cell by ductwork. This blower can now re-
turn about 7400 cfm of air to the duct leading to the coolant stack. Now
when the annulus blower is used to supplement the regular exhaust, the
main radiator blowers can De operated without raising the coolant-cell
pressure above atmospheric.

Shielding

Complete radiation surveys of the reactor area were made at each
higher power level from 1 to 1000 kw. These showed a few areas of un-
acceptably high radiation. The treated-water system has already been
discussed. Scattering of fast neutrons and gamma rays from the reactor
cell into the coolant drain cell through the 30-in. cell ventilation
line caused excessive dose rates outside the access door. A wall of
16 in. of concrete block and 6 in. of borated polyethylene was built in
the coolant drain cell to reduce dose rates al the door to acceptable
values. (The door is locked during nuclear operation to prevent entry
into the cell.) Gamma radiation from the fuel off-gas line in a 3-ft
gap between the reactor building and the vent house required earth shield-
ing, as had been expected. We also expected that additional shielding
would be required directly above the reactor, where there are large cracks
between the shield blocks. However, present indications are that the
shielding there will be adequate.

Component Performance

Considerable effort was spent in modifying and adjusting the ra-
diator to meet operational requirements. Other components performed
well, but there were some failures in convenblonal equipment.

Radiator

The original radiator doors proved inadequate in that they bowed
and jammed when the radiator was heated. In August 1965, doors of im-
proved design were installed. Tests showed that these doors deformed
far less when hot and suffered none of the permanent warping of the
first doors. Heat losses due to air leakage around the doors continued
to present a problem, however. Before all parts of the radiator tubes
could be gotten into an acceptable temperature range for filling with
salt, it was necessary to work out several minor changes. These in-
cluded shimming the gasket to conform to the complex bowing of the doors
and enclosure and changing the heater wiring to give a nonuniform heat
input over the face of the radiator.

At first the new doors did aot move freely. On separate occasions,
both doors hung up and failed to lower, leading to snarling and kinking
of the lifting cables. Reliable, free movement of the doors was attained
only after several revisions. The seal strips were modified to eliminate
35

digging into the asbestos and metal gasket and were attached more securely
to the doors after the strips warped and broke in several places. The
upper limit switch arrangement was changed to prevent hangups due to over-
travel. The door gulde rollers were changed to eliminate binding. More
clearance between the moving doors and the enclosure was provided by mov-
ing the guide tracks and modifying the closing cams, which force the doors
in against the enclosure at the bottom of thelr travel.

When the main blowers were operated to best the doors, other Jdif-
ficulties became apparent. Alr leakage from the sheeb metal enclosure
was clearly excessive (about 10,000 cfu), even though the original de-
sign had been modified to include hoods into which the doors were raised.
The leakage was reduced by installing asbestos cloth boots around the
cables, applying sheet metal to some gaps, and packing insulation in others.
Even so, the leakage required an increase in the cell exhaust capacity
to prevent pressurization of the cell. Ieakage of het air into the re-
gion just above the enclosure caused overheating of electrical insulation
on the numerous thermocouples and power leads in this vicinity. The prob-
lem was compounded because the new door hoods blocked the circulation of
air from the cell coolers. Leak stopping and more thermal insulation
improved the situation, but it was stlll necessary to relocate junction
tages in cooler locations along the cell wall and install higher-tempera-
ture electrical insulation on the thermocouple and the electrical leads
over the enclosure. Flexible ducts and vanes were used Lo redirect cool
air flow over the leads and the lifting mechanisms. See "Component De-
velopment” for additional information about the modifications.

After the improvements in the door seals, alr leakage through the
radiator was manageable, but it was still considerable. Otack draft
alone pulled enough air arcund the closed doors to make the heat losses
(and regulred heater settings) sensitive to the wind outside and the
position of the radiator bypass damper. Lt was found that the dcor~-seal
leakage also depended on whether the doors had been scrammed or were
lowered normally. The first operation at 1 Mw (in run 4) was with one
main blower on, the bypass open, the outlet door raised 15 in., and the
inlet door 211 the way down. later, in run 5, more than 1 Mw was ex-
tracted with both doors down (but not scrammed), cone main blower on,
and. the bypass open.

During the 1-Mw operation in run 4, salt froze in the lines con-
nected to PT 201, the venturi flowmeter located in the upper part of
the radiator enclosure. With the blower on, cool air leakage past the
element made it necesgary to turn on local heaters to prevent freezing.
When the blower was stopped, the heaters had to be turned down to avold
overheating. It appeared likely that in higher-power operation, with
greater air pressure in the radiator, the element could not be kept from
freezing. Therefore, between runs 4 and 5, the top of the enclosure was
cut open, part of the stacked~block insulation was removed, and fibrous
insulation, protected by shim stock, was installed around the element.
Cpeyation in yun 5 indicated that the insulation was then adequate.
ther Components

Heaters. Very little trouble was encountered with the heaters on
the salt systems.

 

A faulty thermocouple led to fallure of two elements in H 106-1, a
heater on the fuel drain line to drain tank 2, in October 1965. Investi-
gation of an anomalous drop in current showed that two elements had failed
after a lengthy period in which the heater was operating near the maximum
power (about 50% higher than other heaters in similar locations). The
thermocouple whose reading was used Go set the heater was then checked.
One lead was grounded in the shield, causing the indicated temperature
to be 400°F low. All three elements in H 106-1 were replaced. X rays
showed that about 1 in. of resistance wire in the two failed elements had
melted. Inspection of the pipe showed no damage from the abnormally high
temperature .

All heaters performed properly during the heatup of the fuel and
coolant loops, with one minor exception. A broken lead turned up on a
heater between the radiator and the coolant pump. It was simply recon-
nected.

After the startup, one of three elements in one of the heat-exchanger
heaters failed. No action was taken because the other elements were enough
to produce the desired temperature.

Drain-Cell Space~-Cooler Motor. The fans on the reactor- and drain-
cell space coolers were originally driven by 3-hp motors; 10-hp motors
were subsequently lnstalled to provide the additional power needed to
keep the fans running in the event of an accident which pressurized the
cells.

 

The motor on the drain-cell cooler failed at the end of run 5, after
about 2900 hr of operation. The cooler was removed, and examination
showed that the rotor had slipped along the shalt until the rotor fan
blades rubbed, causing the stator windings to overheat and to be destroyed.
Normally a force of 2 or 3 tons is required to force the shaft out of a
rotor of this size.

This very unusual failure does not appear to reflect a weakness in
design, but most likely improper manufacture. Therefore, the ruined
motor was replaced with one practically identical.

Component Cooling Pumps. The two component cooling pumps are large,
positive~-displacement blowers which supply cooling air to freeze valves
and other equipment in the reactor and drain-tank cells. Whenever the
fuel system is hot, one pump is kept in operation, with the other on
standby. By the end of February 1966, CCP 1 had operated 4995 hr; CCP 2
had operated only 1620 hr.

 

The drive belts on CCP 2 broke after 1454 hr of operation and again
after 11 additional hours. The belts had been operated at loadings in
excess of thelr rating since the beginning of operation when the sheaves
were changed to reduce blower speed. After this was recognized, follow-
ing the second failure, the sheaves and bells were replaced with a poly-
37

V-belt drive adequate for the 75-hp motor capacity. The original belts
on CCP 1 lasted for 4360 hr before failure. They too were replaced with
a poly-V-belt drive.

At the time of the second failure of the CCP 2 belts, it was dis-
covered that the discharge check valve on this blower was inoperative.
This valve is a 6~-in. butterfly-type valve with an elastomer hinge hold-
ing two flappers in place. The hinge had broken, allowing one flapper
to fall off. The result was that CCP 2 "motored" because of reverse
flow when CCP 1 was operated. The check valve was rebullt and reln-
stalled.

Diegel Generators. VYhree Diesel-powered generators, each with a
capacity of 300 kw, supply emergency ac power to motors and heaters in
the MSRE. There has been no occasion on which this emergency power was
needed. The diesels are started once a week, and once a month they are
operated under partial load. They have also been operated during plauned
power outages for up to 6 hr.

 

In November 1965, coolant leaked into the crankcase of DG 3, and
it was found that an imperfect head made a tight seal beltween head and
block impossible. The head was replaced and the bolts torqued to the
manufacturer's specifications. In Februsry a crack was found in the
block at one of the bolt holes. A stop-leak compound was used bempo-
rarily until repairs could be planned. At the manufacturer's recom-
mendation, repair of the crack was attempted by metallic arc welding.
The attempt was only partly successful, and stop-leak compound was
needed to halt slight seepage from a crack adjacent to the weld. TFurther
attempts at repair are deemed inadvisable, and the expense of a new block
does not appear justifiable in view of the purpose of DG 3 — if it were
to fall when called on for emergency power, it would at worst cause delay
and inconvenience bub no system damage. Presently DG 3 is tested routinely
with the other diesels, but the crankcase oll is monitored especially
carefully for traces of coolant.

Air Compressors. Compressed air at the MSRE is supplied by three
reciprocating air compressors. Two of the compressors, AC 1 and AC 2,
provide instrument air. The other, AC 3, supplies alr for service needs
and, in emergencies, can supply alr to the instrument system.

The service air compressor is an 8~in.-bore, 7-in.-stroke, 5l4-rpm
machine with Teflon rings, installed new in 1962. In more than three
years of service, it failed once, in 1964, when blockage of the after-
cooler discharge line by a falled check valve led to excessive pressure
and a head gasket fallure.

The instrument air compressors are also 8-in.-bore, 7-in.-stroke
machines, bub they were originally equipped with carbon rings and op-
evated at 600 rpm. Both had been used elsewhere, and both had been
overhauled and eguipped with Teflon rings before being placed in service
ab the MSRE in 1964. Through January 1966, six head gasket fallures had
pecurred in these two compressors, three on each compressor.

Investigation of the excessive failure rate on AC 1 and AC 2 led
to the conclusion that the failures were caused by overheating of the
38

cylinder liner, which occurred whenever the cooling-water temperature

or the load was slightly above normal (but still within the specified
range). This was attributed to binding of the Teflon piston rings, which
was observed at times after brief operation at rated load. When the rings
began to bind, the cylinder liner apparently overheated, expanding axially
and deforming the head gasket. Water then leaked from the cooling pas-
sages into the cylinder when the compressor cooled and the cylinder liner
shrank. The compressor manufacturer now recommends a maximum speed of
514 rpm on 7-in.-stroke compressors; apparently piston speeds at 600 rpm
were too high after Teflon rings were substituted for carbon. It was pos-
sible to reduce the speed on AC 1 and AC 2 to 512 rpm and still meet the
requirements for instrument air flow. This change was made, therefore,

by changing the drive sheaves and belts, and apparently the binding and
overheating were eliminated.

Inspection of the Fuel Pump

 

The fuel pump rotary element was removed for inspection after the
flush salt circulation at the end of run 3. The pump was checked for
dimensional changes, deposits, corrosion or erosion of hydraulic parts,
and for rubbing of close~clearance running fils.

The pump was generally in good condition, and nothing was found that
would interfere with the satisfactory operation of the pump. There was
no indication of rubbing of the running fits or of corrosion or erosion
of the hydraulic parts. The only dimensional change was a 0.006~in.
growth of the pump lank bore diameter where the upper O-ring wates with
the puup tank.

Figure 1.18 is a photograph of the lower part of the rotary element
in the decontamination cell where it was examined. The dark stains on
the shield plug are the results of an oll leak through the gasketed Joint
at the catch basin for the lower oil seal. This oil had run down the
surface of the shield plug, where it had become coked by the higher tem-
peratures near the bottom. Some of the oll had reached the upper O-ring
groove at the bottom of the shield plug and had become coked in the groove,
but none appeared to have leaked past the O-ring during high-temperature
operation. Some fresh oil was observed below the ring after the rotary
element had been moved to the decontamination cell, but we believe this
oil dripped from the open oil lines during the transfer to the cell.

The photograph also shows part of a deposit of flush salt that
failed to drain from the labyrinth flange just above the impeller. Cal-
culations of fission product activity after high-power operation indi-
cated that this incomplete drainage would not increase the maintenance
hazard significantly, provided flush salt 1s circulated to flush fuel
from this location prior to the removal. There were also deposits of
salt that contained fuel in both the upper and lower O-ring grooves.
These deposits would not ve effectively diluted during flush salt opera-
tion and would constitute the major radiation source during maintenance
operations.

PHOTO 81122

Fig. 1.18. MSRE Fuel-Circulating-Pump Rotary Element After Run 3.

The parts of the rotary element that had been in contact with the
salt had clean, bare metal surfaces, while the parts exposed to the gas
had a thin black film. There was an abrupt transition, which may be
seen in Fig. 1.18, between the two types of surface, but this transition
was slightly above the actual level. The salt deposit above the laby-
rinth flange and a smaller salt deposit in the pump volute were also
partially covered with a thin black £ilm.8

The pump was reinstalled using remote maintenance techniques so
that these techniques and procedures could be evaluated. Four universal
joints on the flange bolts that had been found broken during the dis-
assembly were repaired prior to the reinstallation of the rotary element.
The failures resulted from excessive bolting torque that had been used
earlier to obtain an initial seal on the flange.

Heat Treatment of Reactor Vessel

 

After the reactor vessel was installed, tests of Hastelloy N from
the heats used in the vessel showed that the closure weld between the top
head and the flow distributor ring would be expected to have poor me-
chanical properties in the as-welded condition. Further tests showed
that the rupture life and ductility, which were unacceptably low, could
40

be practically restored to those of the base metal by stress relieving
for 50 to 100 hr at 1400°F.° Although this is well above the normal op-
erating temperature of the MSRE, it was attainable with the installed
heaters, and calculations showed no harmful thermal stresses would be
involved. Therefore the vessel closure weld was heat treated in place.

Temperatures were monitored by six thermocouples evenly spaced
around the vessel Just below the weld. Because of gaps in the shroud of
vertical heater tubes around the vessel, a perfectly uniform temperature
could not be attained. A day was spent at about 1300°F, adjusting heaters
to minimize the temperature spread. Then for 90 hr the lowest tempera-
ture was held at 1400 * 20°F, while the hottest thermocouple was at
1460 + 20°F. After the vessel was cooled at the end of the treatment,
inspection showed that the furnace and insulation were undamaged.

Stress Analysis of Reactor Piping and Nozzles

 

The MSRE fuel system was designed for the fuel pump and the heat
exchanger to move horizontally and vertically. This was done to keep
the stresses low in the piping and equipment nozzles while accommodating
the expansion and contraction of the closely coupled system as it is
cycled between 150 and 1300°F. During the prenuclear and critical test-
ing we found that the pump mount could not be depended on to move ver-
tically. At the same time we learned that the creep properties of the
metal in the reactor vessel and the piping inside the thermal shield
would deteriorate with neutron irradiation. The former condition could
cause the stresses in the piping and nozzles at the reactor vessel to be
high with the system hot or cold. The latter requires that the stresses
be kept low when the reactor is at high temperature, although normal de-
sign stresses are permissible below about 800°F.

According to our calculations, acceptable stresses at the reactor
vessel nozzles could be obtained by raising the pump 1/2 in. and the
heat exchanger 1/4 in. from thelr existing cold positions and fixing
them against further vertical movement. This "cold springing" would
result in the stresses being high at low temperature, and expansion of
the piping on heating would lower the stress as the temperature is raised.
Because of the relative locations of the supports, fixing the pump and
both ends of the heat exchanger was found by calculation to result in
excessive stresses in the heat-exchanger nozzle during the thermal cy-
cling. However, acceptable stresses could be obtained there by mount-
ing the heat exchanger on spring supports at the end closest to the pump.

The changes were made as indicated above, and the fuel system was
heated to 1200°F. There was no appreciable vertical movement of the
heat exchanger on the spring supports where a downward movement of 0.1
in. had been expected. This indicated that some of the assumptions used
in the calculations were not accurate and the calculated forces at the
heat exchanger were too high, or that the junction of the nozzle to the
shell of the heat exchanger yielded under small forces.

After the system was cooled, strain gages were installed on the heat-
exchanger nozzle and on the piping to the pump. The heat exchanger was
41

ralsed and lowered about 1/8 in. while the forces on the spring supports
and the strains were measured. The measurements indicated that the maxi-
mum stress was in the heat-exchanger nozzle, but that high stresses in
the nozzle were accompanied by large forces on the springs. We concluded
that the spring mounting should act to relieve any large vertical forces
on the nozzle and that the revised installation was satisfactory.

Instrumentation and Controls

 

General

Formal design of the MSRE instrumentation and controls system is
now complete. The need for further additions and modifications to the
instrument and controls system has become apparent as initial operations
progress. oome provide additional system protection, but in the majority
of cases the purpose is to lmprove performance and provide more informa-
tion for the operator. A few minor design errors were corrected, and
some instrumentation was added to simplify maintenance procedures. Ex-
cept for some specification sheet revisions and preparation of a design
report, documentation is complete.

Safety Instrumentation

 

No major changes to the Tiux and temperature safety system were re-
quired. Minor modifications were made as follows:

1, The model Q-2623 relay safety element was altered by replacing
the 115-v ac relays with 32-v de relays. This eliminated ac pickup on
the other modules through which relay coll current is roubed and reduced
the likelihood of spurious trips, particularly when the Q-2602 flux am-
plifier Lrip points are reduced by a factor of 1000 from 1.5 Mw to 15 kw
of reactor power.

2. The voltage adjusting resistor in the rod drive clutch circuit
was increased from 500 to 750 ohms to facilitate setting the cluteh cur-
rent to the necessary and sufficient minimum value.

3. Current meters were placed in the rod drive motor circuits.
Gross changes in motor load, caused, for example, by a sticking rod,
may be inferred from an increase in meter reading.

4, Dynamic braking circuitry for rod drive 1 (servo-controlled
rod) has been designed, built, and tested, with installation scheduled
for March 1966. Braking action is obtained by discharging direct cur-
rent from a capacitor through the motor field windings when the drive
motor is turned off. This break will provide a substantial reduction
in coasting of the rod drive after the power is switched off. As a re-
sult it will take less back-and-forth Jogging to get small increments of
rod motion when manually shimming. Servo performance is expected to im-
prove for the same reason.
D
3S!

To assure a drain, additions and revisions to existing safety cir-
cuits were designed to open the fuel drain-tank vent valves on signal
from high neutron flux (scram) and keep them open until manual reset is
used to permit reclosing.

Wide-Range Counting Channels

 

Reactor power and period information from these two fission counter
channels®? provides interlocks which govern permissible reactor power
levels (control system modes )*? and reactor fill, which Jjohibit rod
withdrawal during start, and which provide control-rod reverse action.

Very generally and typically, reactor period signals from counting
channels operating at low input levels are characterized by slow response.
This inherent delay produced a problem with servo-controlled rod with-
drawal during start. In a servo~controlled start, the demand signal
causes the regulating rod to withdraw until the period-controlled "with-
draw inhibit" interlock operates. Tf the period continues to decrease,
the "reverse" interlock acts to inserit the rods in direct opposition to
the servo demand. These "withdraw inhibit" and "reverse" trip points
were originally established at periods of +20 and +10 sec respectively.
The delayed low-level response of the "inhibit" interlock allowed suf-
ficient incremental rod withdrawal to produce a 10-sec period and thus
cause a reverse. The situation was aggravated by coasting of the shim-
locating motor in the regulating rod limit switch assenbly.n?

As remedial measures, the "withdraw inhibit" and "reverse" period
trip points were changed to +5 and +25 sec, respectively, and an electro-
mechanical clutch-brake was inserted in the shim-locating motor-drive
train. The dynamic brake described above is also expected to reduce this
period overshoot problem.

Provision for testing the period and log power interlock trips in
the wide-range counting channels was provided. Testing is done routinely
by Instrumentation and Controls Division maintenance personnel and is ac-
complished by push buttons inside the instrument chassis.

Nuclear Instrument Penetration

 

We assumed that the neutron flux in the instrument penetrations would
tend to decrease exponentially with increasing distance from the core ves
sel.” This implies that most of the flux within the penetration originates
with neutrons entering the lower end face of the penetration. Figure 1.19
shows that concrete shielding was added in an effort to shield the pene-
tration from other sources of neutron flux. The vernistat in the wide-
range counting channel's model Q-2616 function generator” will compensate
for any reasonable departure from an exact exponential attenuation of
flux; however, it became apparent during the first series of critical ex-
periments that flux attenuation within the Instrument penetration was
deviating, grossly, from the assumed exponential curve. This unseemly
behavior is illustrated by curve A on Fig. 1.20, which shows fission counter
response (normalized count rate) ves withdrawal from the lower end of the
43

penetration in gulde tube 6. It was reasonable to conclude from this,

and from similar curves, that the excess neutrons responsible for the dis-
torted part of the curve were entering the penetration along its length.
The count rates in other guide tubes nearer the upper half of the guide
tube were even more distorted than curve A.

A flux field with attenuation per curve A precludes successful op-
eration of the wide-range counting instrumentation. We decided to shield
the fission counters from stray, side-entry neutrons with shields of sheet
cadmium which were inserted into guide tubes 6 and 2. As a counter travels
up a guide tube during withdrawal, it first enters a partially shielded
section of the guide tube. The partial shielding is obtained by using
wedge-shaped strips of cadmium laid around the guide tube, which provide

BF a Confidence Instrumentation

 

Because of very unfavorable geometry the strongest practicable neu-
tron source would not produce 2 counts /sec from the fission counters in
the wide-range counting channels until the core vessel was approximately
half full of fuel salt; neither would it produce 2 counts /sec with flush
salt in the core at any level. This is the minimum count rate required
to obtain the permissive "confidence" interlock which allows filling the
core vessel and withdrawing the rods. Therefore a counting channel using
a a senoitive BF3 counter was added to establish "confidence" when the core

spel 1s less than half filled with fuel salt. With the revised system,
a n Tuel-galb fill may begin when the reactor vessel is empty if BF3 count

actor vessel is half full unless "confidence" is established with either of
the two wide-range counting channels. When filling the reactor vessel with
flush salt, rods may be withdrawn and the fill allowed to proceed at any
level if BF; count rate "confidence" is established and if the drain-

tank selector switch is in the fuel flush tank (FFT) position. Selection
of the FFT position bypasses the half-full welght interlock and requires
administrative approval. Figure 1.21 is a block diagram of this BFFs count-
ing channel.

Personnel Monitoring System

 

The reactor building radiation and contamination warning system
was revised to correct some deficiencies and to improve ils effective-
ness as indicated by tests and experience during reactor power operation.
An alarm relay was installed in the personnel and stack monitor alarm
system circuitry to provide an annunciation upon loss of the 24-v de
power supply. Monitron RE-70L2, located in the south end of the high
bay, was moved east about 20 ft to monitor for possible radiation escaping
from the nuclear instrument penetration. CAM RE-7001 wag moved closer
to the sampler-enricher to monitor its operation. Several of the Q-2091
beta-gamma monitors were relocated to provide more protection. One unit
was installed in the instrument shop, one wit was removed from the health
vhysice office and installed in the hall between Buildings 7503 and 7509,
and. the unit in the vent house was relocated to reduce its background
response from lines in the vent house. Two additional alr horns were
added to increase the area covered by the horn evacuation signal. One
horn was installed on the southeast corner of Building 7509 and the other
in the diesel house. Four additicnal beacon alarm lights were Installed
in areas where the horn might not be heard. A light was installed in the
vent house, cooling~water equipment room, the switch house, and the Plant
46

and Equipment shop bullding. A Q-2277 rate meter and Q-2101 alpha orobe
will be installed in the hot change house.

Control Instrumentation

 

Containment. To maintain the integrity of the reactor secondary
containment, solenoid block valves with safety-grade wiring were Iin-
stalled in the fuel-drain-tank steam dome drain piping. These valves
are interlocked to close when reactor cell air activity or pressure is
above limits. The interlocks override a manual switch used for normal
operation of the steam dome drain system. Actuating signals were ob-
tained from existing circuits.

Safety-grade control circults were installed to operate four weld-
sealed solenoid valves serving the fuel off-gas sample system. The
valves are specially designed and constructed Tor use on MSRE contain-
ment systems and are identical to those previously purchased for use in
the fuel-pump-bowl bubbler level system. The procurement of four addi-
tional valves from a commercial source 1s nearing coupletion.

Fuel Sampler-Inricher. The fuel sampler-enricher safety-grade con-
trol circults were revised to increase the reliability of the two con-
talnment barriers between the primary system (fuel pun bowl) and the
operator. Originally, the circuits were designed so that the sample
access port could be opened 1f either the operational valve or the
maintenance valve was closed. With this arrangement a condition existed
wherein a single failure could permit the access port to be opened when
both the operational valve and the maintenance valve were open. 1f this
had occurred when the manipulator cover was removed, the manipulator boot
could have become the only containment barrier between the operator and
the fuel pump bowl. Since the boot could be ruptured by system pressures
in excess of 10 psig, this condition was considered to be hazardous.

The circults are now designed so that both the maintenance valve and

the operational valve must be closed before the access port is opened.
Also, the removal valve and access port must be closed and the manipulator
cover must be in place before either the operational or the maintenance
valve can be opened. The position of the cover 1s detected by a newly
installed vacuum pressure switch. Additional protection for the manipu-
lator woot has also been provided by a new circuit that prevents develop-
ment of excessive differential pressure across the hoot during sampler
evacuation operation. This protection is accomplished by closing a valve
in an exhaust lige to the vacuum pump when the differential pressure across
the boot exceeds 30 in. (water column).

 

Fuel and Coolant Pumps. To satisfy established operating criterias,
the fuel and coolant salt circulating pump control circuits were revised
as follows:

 

1. Tn both the fuel and coolant salt circulating pump circuits, the
existing pump bowl level switch actuation valve was changed to re-
duce the level at which the pump is stopped, and one new switch was
installed to prevent pump startup until normal fill level is reached.
Since the salt level drops 8 to 12% after pump startup, the single
47

level switch system previously used did not leave enough operating
margin to prevent normal level fluctuations from stopping the pump
and shutting down the reactor.

2. To prevent unnecessary shutdowns, the control which indicates that
FV 103 is frozen is now sealed out after the fuel pump starts. The
only purpose of this interlock is to prevent pump startup until the
freeze valve is closed.

3. Jumpers were added around the coolant salt system helium off-gas ra-
diation contacts in the fuel pump circuit to prevent the pump from
stopping each time a’ circuit test is conducted. The radiation monitor
igs a safety-grade device, and its primary function is to initiate an
emergency drain. Both channels must be tested routinely.

Fuel Procegsing System. A mass flow-rate meter was installed to
indicate the flow of HF to the fuel storage tank during fuel processing
operations. The purpose of this second flow measurement is to provide
an independent check on the existing orifice meter because the HF flow
rate is important in calculating the amount of oxide removed from the
fuel salt.

 

To prevent possible diffusion of Hz into the HF gas supply cylinder,
interlocks were installed to close both the Hp and HF gas supply station
valves when the main gas supply valve to the fuel storage tank is closed.

Operating Experience — Process and Nuclear Instruments

Control System — Relays. Little or no trouble has been experienced.
Virtually all design changes to the relay control gear have been made to
meet new requirements developed by operating experience, not to correct
malfunctions of this equipment.

 

Valves. The difficulty experienced with the pressure control valve,
PCV 522A, in the pump bowl off-gas system is a part of the larger general
problem of off-gas contamination? by carryover of solids and vapors which
are deposited in the off-gas lines. Valve-selection criteria for the off-
gas system did not include considering nongaseous foreign matter in the
off-gas stream.

Two pressure control valves, PCV 500J and PCV 510Al, in the main in-
let helium line gave difficulty from galling. These valves are being re-
worked.

Pressure Transducers. One strain gage unit in the sampler-enricher
suddenly shifted calibration, but during operation returned to its original
state. The most likely explanation is molsture which, after getting into
the device, was baked out during service.

 

Thermocouples. Thermocouple performance has been excellent. Only
one in-cell thermocouple was lost during the six-month period covered by
this report. The plastic insulation on the radiator thermocouple lead
wires suffered from local temperatures” which were substantially in ex-
cess of those anticipated. Remedial measures such as insulabing indi-
vidual wires with ceramic beads, directed flows of cooling air, and in-
48

sulating the high-temperature regions from heat sources have reduced, but
not eliminated, the problem.

Iiquid-~Level Bubblers. The helium bubbler instrumentation used for
fuel salt level instrumentation experienced a mechanical failure in two
of the differential pressure-sensing instruments. The failure was a
leaky connection caused by weak welduents fabricated by the vendor and
used to attach autoclave fittings to the pressure inlet tubing. With
the assistance of the Metals and Ceramics Division, the weldment was re-
designed and rewelded. No further difficulties have been experienced.

 

Weight Tostrumentation on Salt Tanks. The system has not been en-
tirely satisfactory. The basic input instrumentation (weigh cells, mount-
ing, etc.) has functioned satisfactorily, but the readout has given trouble.
Manometer readout is accomplished by selecting a particular weigh cell
channel with pneumatic selector valves. The valves are composed of a
stacked array of individual valves operated by cams on the operating handle
shaft. The valves leak; proposals to eliminate the problem are being con-
sidered.

 

Nuclear Safety Instrumentation. The electronic instruments have
given little trouble. The solid-state modular instruments, hitherto un-
tried in an operating installation, have needed very little service, and
no major problems have developed with use. Channel 3 of the safety systen
produced an abnormal number of spurious trips. A large number of these
are believed to have originated in faulty, vibrabtion-sensitive relays in
a commercial electronic switch which provides the high-temperature trip
signal in the channel. Vibration isolation and substitution of a dif-
ferent relay are being consldered as possible antidotes. Another source
of occasional false trips is believed to have originated with a chatter-
ing of the relays which change the sensitivity of the flux amplifiers in
the safety circuits. This has been corrected. Very generally the source
of spurious trips has been difficult to trace, since they are random and
usually appear to be unrelated to events elsewhere in the reactor sys-
tem. As electrical nolse~producing components elsewhere in the system
are eliminated, the number of false trips is expected Lo be reduced.

 

Wide-Range Counting Channels. Moisture penetration has been ex-
perienced with the wide-range counting channel "snake" 8 assembly. An
improved waterproof jacket is expected to cure this affliction. A faulty
vernistat and an overloaded gear reducer in the drive unit of the wide-
range counting channel required replacement.

 

Linear Power Channels and Servo Controller. The compensated ion
chambers use a small electric motor to change compensation. One motor
drive has given some trouble and has been responsible for the maintenance
required by these chambers. The servo rod controller has been used for
automatic control in both the flux and temperature modes. Excepting the
problem associated with the wide-range counting channel, the servo's per-
formance was very satisfactory.

 

Electrical Power System. Substitution of the new 50-kva solid-state
converter for the existing 25-kva motor generator is expected to reduce
or eliminate many of the problems stemming from instability, noise, and
poor voltage regulation.

 
~
\O

False alarms from the monitron in the east service tunnel were trace
to electrical noise from the sampler~enricher vacuum punps. An electrical
noise Filter ls being designed to remedy this. A faulty solid-state switch

in the gampler-enricher was responsible for noise in the oubput of the
Sorensen regulator.

Data System

The installation of extensive modifications®® to the data~logger—
computer was completed on August 31, 1965, and testing began immediately.
Several failed computer components were found and replaced, and two loose
connections in the analog input system were found and repaired. Additional
design changes and adjustments were required as a result of the modifica-
tions, and, with the exception of the digital filter-integrator, which re-
quired complete redesign, these changes and testing were completed on Sep-
tember 16. The seven-day acceptance test was restarted on Sephember 16,
1965, and completed September 23, 1965. The remainder of September was
spent correcting miscellaneous hardware problems, principally loose cir-
cult card connections. Arn air-conditioning failure caused the computer
room ambient temperature to rise to 85°F, and, simultaneously, the ac supply
voltage fell to 103 v. These two conditions, although simultaneous, were
not coupled. In these clrcumstances it was impossible to keep the system
on line for more than a few hours at a time. It was concluded that suc-
cessful operation of the computer requires that ambient temperature be
held below 85°F and that ac supply voltage be maintained bebween 105 and
120 v.

Satisfactory operation was restored, and the system was accepted on
October 1, 1965, provided that Bunker-Ramo Corporation (1) supplies and
installs a digital filter-~integrator for the analog input signals, and
(2) provides and installs, at ORNL's opblon, clrcuitry which prevents
damage to the core memory by restart transients subsequent to a power
logs and which provides a controlled seguence automatic restart when
power is restored.

October was spent checking and calibrating inoub instrumentation
and in troubleshooting hardware fallures, principally in the analog in-
put area of the system. Instrument calibrations were completed in No-
vember, as were substantial modifications to improve reliability sched-
uled by Bunker-Ramc. The digital filter-integrator and restart clreultry
were also installed during this shutdown.

In the period of December 1965 through February 1966, the logger-
computer achieved operating status. In addition to the routine and
periodic collection of operating data, 1t was used to obtain transient
and frequency responses and to determine fuel temperature coefficients
of reactivity. It was programmed to operate the control rod for the
pseudorandom binary tests reported in "MSRE Dynamic Tests," this report.
The log of operating data, which did not seem significant during opera-
tion, became extremely useful during analysis of the off-gas problem.
During this period the various computing and logging programs were being
modified in accordance with the requirements developed during reactor op-
eration.

Figure 1.22 charts, on a weekly basis, the "in service" or "on" time

as a percent of total time. The shaded areas on the figure are scheduled
shutdowns and cannot be charged against the system as malfunctions. During
the period immediately following system acceptance, performance, as noted
above, was disappointingly low and did not approach the specified require-
ments. The system has shown a slow but steady overall improvement in op-
erating reliability as debugging progressed. For example, during February
the logger-computer "in service" time was 99.7%.

MSRE Training Simulators

 

The power level training simulatort? was operated successfully in
bp

October 1965 as part of the operator training program. It was set up on
two general-purpose, portable EAT-TR-10 analog computers and tied in with
the reactor instrumentation system. No special hardware was required.
The control of the simulator was effected entirely from the operator's
console, where actual rod motion, radiator door positioning, and blower

provided by the reactor instrumentation. The simulator was used Lo check
out the reactor Flux and load control systems and the procedures used to
switch from flux to temperature servocontrol.

Documentation

Except for some revisions and additions to instrument specification
sheet and preparation of a design report, documentation of the MORE in-
strumentation and controls system design is complete. During the past
report period, instrument application and switeh tabulations were com-
pleted and issued, and design drawings were revised to incorporate as-
built revigions and recent additions to and revisions of the system.

2. COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT

The efforts of the development group were devoted to assisting in
the prepower operation and testing of the reactor. Several changes in
the equipment and procedures were made, and these are described below.

Freeze Valves
The specifications for all but three of the freeze valves were sim-

plified by eliminating the "rapid" thaw requirement. This requirement is
needed in FV103, which controls the emergency drain of the reactor, and
in FV204 and FV206, which control the emergency drain of the coolant
system, but had been included in the remaining valves only as an opera-
tional convenience. Since the maintenance of the proper temperature dis-
tribution needed to ensure a rapid thaw was more difficult than was con-
sistent with good operating practice, the rapid thaw requirement was
eliminated, and these valves are now operated either in the thawed or
deep~frozen condition. The valves which might contain sufficient radio-~
activity in the salt to produce radiolytic fluorine at low temperatures
are maintained above 400°F at all times. Experience with the in~pile ex-
periments and other tests have shown that essentially no fluorine 1s re-
leased avove this temperature.

The addition of the modulating air-flow controllers on FVI03, FV204,
and FV206 and the separation of the heaber control circuits on FV204 and
206 have resulted in greatly improved operation of the freeze valves.

Control Rods

Control rod units 1 and 2 have operated without difficulty since the
initial installation at the reactor, Examination of rod 3 at the end of
the criticality tests revealed that the braided wire sheath had been torn
zt a point 28 in. below the tow block. The inner convoluted hose was
worn bub not completely through the wall. Cause of the damage appeared
to be the upper roller in the control rod thimble, which had jammed and
would not rotate. The roller had a galled flat area on one side. The
thimble roller and upper control rod hose were replaced. DBecent examina~
tion indicated no further difficulty after several months of operation
alt temperature.

Rod drop times for 51 in. fall remain at 0.72 sec to 0.8 sec for all
three rods. Overall rod lengths remained within 0.10 in. of the installed
lengths.

Thermal switches were installed in the lower end of the drive housing
and are set to alarm when the temperature rises above 200°F. The air flow
through the drive unit cases is about 1.4 scfm, which appears to be ade-
quate to maintain the temperature within the housings at less than 200°F.

It was necessary to replace the No. 3 drive unit because the position
indicators revealed an 0,8-in. deviation from the original zero sel point.
The deviation was caused by a partially restricted spring actlon of the
preload spring operator of the drive chain. This allowed enough slack in
the drive chain to permit the chain links to slip over the sprocket gear
teeth. The unit continued to operate without difficulty with the 0.8-in.
error until replaced.

The lower limit switch of unit No. 3 showed an intermittent tendency
to stick when the control rod was dropped from above 24 in. The switch
could be released by fully withdrawing the control rod. We found that
the shock absorber stroke was 25% greater than normal when the control rod
was dropped from 51 in. There is evidence that the inertia of the switch
actuating arm was sufficient, when the control rod was dropped from 51
in., to overcome the force of the actuator recovery spring to a point
where the lower end of the actuating rod could strike the lower flange of
the drive unit. ‘The actuating rod had been slightly bent due to striking
the flange, causing it to bind in the guide bushing. A stronger recovery
spring will be installed to prevent the overtravel.

Figure 2.1 is a photograph of the control rod drive units in position
on the reactor. The shielding and access hatch have been removed, showing
the air and electrical disconnects in the drive unit cover. When a unit
is removed, the small hatch on the drive unit cover is removed (note unit
No. 2 in Fig. 2.1), which permits access to the control rod tow block for
releasing the control rod from the drive unit, and also access to the
lower drive unit flange for releasing the drive unit from the thimble
flange. This method of removal has been utilized for conbrol rod mainte-
nance since the initial installation at the reactor.

Radiator Doors

Thermal warping of the radiation doors and door seals permitted air
to leak through the radiator enclosure at an excessive rate, and modifi-
cations had to be made to reduce the leakage.

The following modifications were made (Fig. 2.2 shows the face of the
radiator with the inlet door raised after repairs and modifications):

1. The door trip locks. The locks were modified and adjusted so that,
when the door was Tully closed, the trip locks forced the metal door,
by a forward camming action, against the soft seal on the face of the
radiator enclosure. The forward force is exerted by movement of the
door in the downward direction into the rolling cam locks located on
the radiator frame.

Door guide tracks. The door moved too close to the radiator seals
when it was raised or lowered. Warpage of the door caused some of
the seal elements to hang on the door, and they were torn loose. The
position of the door track was moved to provide 1 in. of clearance
between the seals and the face of the door when the door was released
from the fully closed position.

Cam follower bracket. The doors tended to drag and jam in the guide
tracks. Cams had been installed in the tracks to force the doors away
from the seals when they were not fully closed. The cam follower
brackets are mounted on the doors, and contain rollers which ride on
the track cams. These rollers were damaged by the wedging action of
the trip locks against the door rollers and tracks when the doors were
dropped into the closed position. The cams were changed to provide
clearances of 1/8 in. between the rollers and cams when the doors were
closed. A short movement of a door in the upward direction brings

the roller into contact with the cam, forcing the door away from the
soft seal.

End rollers were installed on the cam follower brackets to prevent
side motion from Jamming the doors against the tracks.

Reliable operation of the limit switches is important in reducing the
number of ways in which the doors can malfunction, and the original
switches were not very reliable. New heavy-duty switches and actu-
ators were installed to obtain more positive action. An additional
upper limit safety switch was added plus a mechanical "hard stop"
above the added upper limit switch. In the event of complete switch
failure the door strikes the "hard" stop and an overload switch stops
the drive motor before the door seals can be damaged.

The door position indicators are synchro-driven devices located on
the drive shafts. The doors are lifted by steel cables which are
wound and unwound on chain-driven sheaves on the drive shafts. If
the doors Jam while being lowered, the sheaves continue to turn and
give incorrect indications of the true door positions. Continued ac-
tion of the drive unit, after the doors have stopped moving, causes
the lifting cables to unwind from the sheaves and attempt to rewind
in the reverse direction. The cables usually jump out of the grooves
in the sheaves and become snarled and kinked.

A "loss-of-tension” device has been designed but not installed which

will stop any action of the drive unit should the cables become slack.
It is simply a switch which will be actuated by movement of the cable from
its normal tightened position.

7.

When the clearance between the door and door seals was changed to 1
in. with the door open (see No. 2 above) it was necessary to provide
additional clearance between the door and the radiator enclosure hood.
The hoods on both inlet and outlet doors were shifted 1-1/2 in. to
provide this clearance.

Radiator Heater Electrical Insulation Failure

The electrical leads from the radiator heaters extended vertically
up through the radiator enclosure and terminated in junction boxes on
the floor of the area between the radiator door hoods. These leads are
insulated with ceramic beads. The electrical leads extending from the
Junction boxes to the supply and control circuits were plastic-insulated
wires which were rated for 140°F. Heat leaks up through the radiator
enclosure along the wire bundles overheated the junction boxes, and the
plastic insulation melted.

The heat leakage into this area was reduced by welding the original
sheet-metal enclosure wherever possible, by patching some openings, and
by reinsulating. The junction boxes were removed from the high-temperature
area between the hoods to a cooler position on the east wall of the pent-
house. Electrical wire extensions between the relocated junction boxes
and the beaded heater lead wires were insulated with 194°F thermoplastic
and asbestos composition. Figure 2.3 shows the present arrangement of
the heater wiring between the hoods over the radiator doors. Increased

circulation of cooling air in that area was provided by rerouting some

of the existing exhaust ducts. Cool air is directed downward through

the drive mechanism into the heater lead area; exhaust ducts remove the
heated air from the floor between the hoods. The south exhaust duct can
be seen in Fig. 2.3. There are two additional exhaust ducts on the north
end of the ares; these are 10-in.-diam flexible tubes. Alsc a duct was
installed between the door hoods so the hoods will be cooled when the
main blowers are running.

The average ambient temperature in the area between the doors after
the above modifications was approx 100°F with the blowers off. Tempera.-
ture within the beaded electrical lead bundle penetrations at the top of
the radiator was 600°F with the blowers off. These temperatures are sat-
isfactory, and the temperatures also were satisfactory with the blowers
on.

Sampler-Enricher

During the shutdown period following run 3, the low-power experiment,
several modifications were made to the sampler-enricher to increase the
efficiency of operation. Most of these were discussed in the previous
semiannual report.’ The major modifications made at that time included:
(1) replacing the removal valve with a modified version, (2) adding a
knob to one linkage pin of each access port operator to aid in opening
it with the manipulator if it should fail to function properly, (3) put-
ting steel rings in the convolutions of the manipulator inner boot to
hold it free of the manipulator arm, and (4) adding a pressure switch to
prevent an excessive pressure gradient across the manipulator boot.

The manipulator arm which was bent during run 3 was replaced. The
hand was straightened, and a 1/4 X 1/4 in. projection was welded to the
bottom of each finger to aid in handling the capsule cable. Clearances
in the Castle joint were increased to reduce the force needed to operate
the manipulator.

Additional changes have been made to improve the reliability of op-
eration. The brass keys used to attach the capsules to the latch were
replaced with nickel-plated mild steel keys. In case a capsule is dropped
it can now be retrieved with a magnet.

Two changes were made in the interlock circuit. A pressure switch
installed on the manipulator cover requires a negative pressure in the
cover before the operational or the maintenance valve can be opened.

Also, both the operational and the maintenance valves must be closed be-
fore either the access port or the removal valve can be opened. These
changes were made to ensure that there is double containment at all times.

Installation of lead shielding around the sampler-enricher has been
completed. Ten inches of lead or the equivalent was installed around
the main components and 4 in. around the off-gas system. While the re-
actor was operating at 1 Mw, the radiation level around the equipment
was < 1 mr/hr.
During runs 4 and 5, 40 samples were taken, 9 of which were 50-g
samples for oxygen analysis in place of the usual 10-g samples. Two
of the large capsules failed to trap a sample. The first assembly was
not long enough to submerge the fill opening of the capsule in salt in
the pump bowl. All other assemblies were made longer. The second failure
to trap a sample probably resulted from the capsule catching on the latch
stop at the top of the pump and not entering the pump bowl. The capsule
has been modified slightly to make it hang straighter and is therefore
less apt to hang.

While withdrawing one of the 10-g capsules, the position indicator
stopped, indicating that the capsule had hung or the cable had jammed.
After repeated attempts, the cable was withdrawn completely. The cable
was examined to determine the cause of trouble. Apparently the capsule
or lateh had hung on the gate of the maintenance or operational valve
causing the cable to coll up. The cable also backed up into the drive
unit box and caught ian the motor gears. The cable was straightened, the
open limit switches on the operational and maintenance valves were reset
to open the valves wider, and the outside diameter of the latch was re-
duced. No similar trouble has been experienced.

The equilibrium buffer pressure to the operational valve dropped
from 55 to 35 psia during one sampling operation. This represents a
leak of about 20 cc He/min through the seal on the upper gate of the
valve. A particle of salt or metal apparently dropped on the gate while
the capsule wag heling removed or attached to the latch and lodged be-
tween the gate and the seat. Repeated efforts to blow the particle from
the sealing surface have falled. The leak rate has not increased with
continued use. The leak of helium from the buffer system is mainly an
inconvenience, as 1t slowly pressurizes the volume above the valve, and
the gas must be vented to the auxiliary charcoal bed about once a day.
Besides this seal, three more sealing surfaces bebween the pump bowl and
the sample access area provide adequate safety; therefore the valve will
not be replaced at this time.

The sample capsule used while the reactor was operating at 1 Mv left
considerable contamination in the transport container. The cpen end of
the bottom cup read 40 r/ar near contact after the capsule was removed.
Replaceable liners have been fabricated to reduce the contamination left
in the transport container.

Coolant Salt Sampler

 

During runs 4 and 5, ten samples were isolated from the coolant
punp bowl, two of which were 50-g samples. During one sampling the
latch failed to slide freely through the transfer tube. No reason for
the difficulty could be found, bub the outside diameter of the latch
was reduced to lessen the possibility of future trouble.

During the shutdown period following run 3 a capsule was left hang-
ing on the latch. A dry helium atmosphere was maintained in the sampler.
60

When the capsule was retrieved from the pump bowl in taking the first
sample of run 4 (Cp-4-1), a black Iilm covered the salt and adhered to the
outside of the capsule. The film was identified as decomposed oil. An-
other sample taken 4 hr later was clean with no evidence of black film.
The sampler was opened and examined for oll contamination. A small

amount was found on the top flange of the glove box near the elastomer
gasket. No evidence of oll was found around the drive unit or capsule.
The source of the oil was not located, but subsequent samples have been
free of the film.

Examination of Components from the MSRE Off-Gas System

 

The difficulty with plugging and partial restriction in the MSREE
off-gas system is described in the section on systems performance. Sev-
eral of the components which had given trouble during the early operation
at 1/2 and 1 Mw were removed to the HRLEL for examination. Photographs
were taken through periscopes, and many samples of the foreign material
found in the components were removed and transferred to the analytical
chemistry hot cells for analysis. The results of these analyses are re-
ported in the section on chemistry. A summary of the visual examinations
made in HRLEL is given below.

Capillary Flow Restrictor FE 521

 

The flow restrictor consists of a short length of 0.08-in.-ID tubing
welded into the line at one end and coiled to fit inside a 3-in.~ID con-
tainer. The other end of the line is left free. The container was cut
open, and the entrance and exit ends of the restrictor tubing were ex-
amined. The entrance region was clean, and only a small deposit was
found on the container wall near the end of the discharge region. This
deposit 1s shown in Fig. 2.4. The restrictor was not completely plugged
when examined in the hot cell.

Check Valve CV 533

The check valve is a small spring-loaded poppet-type valve installed
in the gas line to prevent a backflow into the fuel pump gas space during
the venting operation on the drain tanks. Some foreign material was found
on examination of the poppet, but this was not sufficient to stop the
gas flow. The valve poppet is shown in Fig. 2.5, and for the purpose
of the examination is shown in the open position. The soft O-ring which
makes the seal can also be seen in ils normal position on the poppet.

The other material on the cone of The poppet is an amber varnish-like
material, which was identified as a hydrocarbon.

Charcoal Bed Inlet Valve HV 621

 

The valve examined was one of four which control the gas flow into
each of four parallel charcoal sections which make up the main charcoal
61

bed. The valve had given indications of almost complete plugging before
removal from the system. The valve was cut apart with a saw in the hot
cell, and the valve stem is shown in Fig. 2.6. The small metallic chips
shown near the large end of the cone are from the sawing operation. The
entire cone was shiny as though wet with an oillike material. There was
some white amorphous powder on the tapered section of the valve trim.

The powder seemed to be adhering fairly strongly to the metal surface,

although there were some discontinuities. A similar material was found
in the valve body. The general appearance of this area indicated that

the powder had moved up and down with the motion of the valve stem and

was therefore not dislodged by the small stroke of the valve. Samples

of the white material were removed for analysis.

Line 522 Pressure Control Valve PCV 522

PCV 522 controls the gas overpressure on the reactor system by vary-
ing the gas letdown (off-gas flow). The flow passage at the valve seat
was quite small (about 0.010 in.) in order to control the relatively low
gas flow (4.2 liters/min). The valve was mounted with the seat above
the stem. Flow was down through the seal (reverse of normal). The
valve stem was covered with an amber oillike coating, and there was an
accumulation of fluid in the recess formed by the bellows-to-stem adapter
piece as shown in Fig. 2.7. The tapered flat (flow area) on the stem
had small accumulations of solid material. The valve body was coated
with similar material and had a semisolid mass of material on the sur-
face near the seat port as shown in Fig. 2.8. Samples of these materials
were removed for analyses.

Line Filter 522

Filter 522 is a l-in.-diam by 15-in.-long cylindrical type 316 stain-
less steel sintered metal element in a 1-1/2-in. (iron pipe size) pipe
housing. Element thickness is 1/16 in. Flow is from the outside in.

The filter area is 0.34 6%, and the removal rating is 98% particles

> 0.7 pu. The pressure drop (clean) at 4.2 liters/min helium (normal MSRE
flow) is 2 in. HO. The filter was installed immediately upstream of the
reactor gas pressure control valve (PCV 522) to protect the very fine
valve trim.

The filter assembly was removed from line 522 on February 8, 1966.
Initial visual examination was made at HRLEL on February 9, 1966. The
upper one-third of the element was largely steel gray in appearance.

As shown in Fig. 2.9, the steel gray also appeared in the lower portion
at the seam weld and in a few isolated spots. The major portion of the
lower two-thirds of the element had a frosty white appearance. At no
place was there any evidence of a measurable buildup, or cake, on the
filter surface.

Visual examination was continued on February 10, 1966, at which
time it was noted that the frosty white areas had become darker in ap-
pearance, tending toward the steel gray. Inspection of the interior of
the filter housing showed an accumulation of foreign material in the
bottom as shown in Fig. 2.10. Samples were scraped from the side of the
element. The filter was then reassembled, and a flow pressure drop test
(see below) was run on February 11, 1966. The filter was once again dis-
assembled, and the element was sectioned into short pieces. The foreign
material in the bottom of the housing was removed readily by rinsing with
carbon disulfide.

Flow Test on the MSRE Filter from Line 522

 

The filter and filter housing which had been removed from line 522
on February 8, 1966, was tested in the hot cell of the HRLEL as indicated
in the flow diagram given in Fig. 2.11, and flow tests were conducted on
February 11, 1966. The gas was discharged into the gas disposal filter
system of the hot cell. By taking readings of the filter pressure gage
through the hot cell window for various helium flow rates the relative
plugging of the filter was determined.

The data obtained are shown in Fig. 2.12. The graph also shows the
results of a helium flow test conducted on a duplicate but clean filter.
The data indicate that for a given pressure difference the 522 filter
was passing only 5% of the corresponding flow of the clean filter. How-
ever, extrapolation of the data to the normal MSRE off-gas flow indicate
that, even though 95% plugged, the contribution of the filter (0.075 psi)
to the total system pressure drop (5 psi) was negligible.

processing system. Design of the modifications to the mechanical equip-
ment is finished except for the shielding. Modifications to the equip-
ment to upgrade it for 15-psig service are nearly complete.

Redesign of the instrumentation is complete. This work involved
some revisions to panel and field instrumentation, some changes in control
circuitry, preparation of installation and interconnection drawings re-
quired to install the system at the MSRE site, and revisions of nomen-
clature and numbering of instruments and circuits to conform with the
MSRE practices.

Functionally, the instrumentation and control of the chemical proc-
ess sampler is similar to that provided on the fuel sampler-enricher
system; however, the detail design of the chemical prccess system sampler
is simpler. This reduction in complexity resulted from reduced require-
ments Tor containment, which, in turn, resulted from the lower radiation
levels present in the chemical processing system. The reduced contain-
ment requirements permitted the use of conventional (single tracked)
control circuitry instead of the redundant (dual tracked) "safety grade
circuitry used in the fuel sampler-enricher. Also, it was possible, in
some cases, to use commercial-grade components instead of special weld-
sealed components. In other cases the reduction in requirements for con-
tainment and/or redundancy eliminated the need for components.

0ff-Gas Sampler

A system 1s being designed to permit analysis of the reactor off-
gas stream. The arrangement is shown schematically on Fig. 2.13. A
side stream of 100 ce /min is taken from the reactor off-gas stream at
a point downstream of the in~cell volume holdup. The sample stream
passes to the sample unit inlet manifold, whence it may be routed to one
of three alternate paths:

1. a thermal conductivity cell for on-line determination of gross con-
taninant level,

2. a chromatograph cell for batch-wise and quantitative determination
of contaminants,

3. a refrigerated molecular sieve trap for isclation of a concentrated
sample, which will be transferred to a hot cell for analysis.

The sample equipment will be housed in a containment box located in
the pipe trench south of the vent house. A recirculating air system
coupled with a radiation detector 1s provided to permit rapid detection
of system leaks.

In addition to the off-gas sampler, an abbtempt will be made to study
the nature and character of off-gas contaminants by inserting various
sample coupons into the pump-bowl vapor space through the sampler-enricher
line.

Instrumentation and controls design for the off-gas sampler is in
progress and nearing completion. Instrumentation is being provided for

on-line chromatographic and conductivity analysis; for measurements of
flows, pressures, and temperatures required for proper operation of and
interpretation of data from the chromatograph and conductivity analyzers;
for control of temperature of a molecular sieve trap and of the level of
a liquid-nitrogen bath in which the molecular sieve is immersed; for de-
tection and annunciation of undesirable operating conditions; and to pre-
vent the occurrence of hazardous conditions.

Since the sampler will be an integral part of the primary contain-
ment during sampling operations, and since some components of the sampler
would not meet the requirements for primary containment system components,
solenoid block valves will be installed in the inlet and outlet lines
which connect the sampler to the reactor system. Two valves will be in-
stalled in series in each line. These valves will automatically close
and isolate the sampler from the reactor system in the event of high pres-
sure in the reactor containment cell, high pressure in the fuel-pump bowl,
or high air activity in the sampler enclosure. High reactor cell pressure
is indicative of a rupture of the primary containment and the occurrence
of the maximum credible accident. High fuel-pump-bowl pressure indicates
that conditions exist that could result in a rupture of the sampler pri-
mary containment. High sampler-air activity indicates that a rupture of
the sampler primary containment has occurred. Closure of the block valves
resulting from high sampler-air activity (and the accompanying alarm) will
also provide protection to the sampler operator against the occurrence of
high background radiation resulting from small leaks in the sampler.
Sampler-air activity will be detected by two GM-tube-type (ORNL model Q-
1916) gamma monitors, which will monitor two separate and independent
69

alr samples collected from and returned to the sampler enclosure. The
isolation block valves and associated detecting instruments and control
circuitry were designed in accordance with the recommendations of the
ORNL "Proposed Standard for the Design of Reliable Reactor Protective
Systems." At least two independent devices were used to supply input
signals to the system and to effect the corrective blocking action.
One-out-of-two logic was used in the control circuitry, and separation
and identification were maintained in the detail design of the wiring.

Panel-mounted instrumentation will occupy 5 lin ft of panel (6 tt
high X 2 ft deep). These panels will be located in the vent house, south
of the reactor building. The sampler and associated instrumentation will
be located in a trench outside the vent house. Since all major sampling
operations will be carried out at the sampler, all readout of information
will be presented at the sampler panels; however, occurrence of an alarm
condition at the sampler will actuate an annunclator in the main control
room, and provisions are being made to permit some information to be trans-
mitted to the Computer-Data Logger. Also, a sample permissive switch will
be located in the main control room. This switch, which is connected in
the block valve circuits, will be used to prevent operation of the sampler
without knowledge of the reactor operators.

Most of the instrument components used in the off-gas sampler were
salvaged from the ORNL MIR-47-6 experiment located at Idaho Falls or were
on. hand in ORNL Reactor Division stores. Reconditioning and calibration
of this equipment and procurement of additional components are nearing
completion. Preparation of instrument application drawing is essentially
complete. Panel design is approximately 75% complete. Interconnection
wiring and piping design is under way, and fabrication of panels is also
wder way.

Xenon Migration in the MORE

 

Based on results of the ®°Kr experiment? and xenon stripper effi-
ciency reported by the University of Tennessee, the steady-state 135%e
poison fraction for the MERE was computed. The following major assump-
tions were made:

1. No bubbles circulating with the fuel salt.

2. Todine remains in solution, that is, it is not adsorbed on any sur-
faces and is not volatilized in any form.

3. Xenon is not ‘adsorbed on any surfaces.

4. The mass transfer of xenon across the salt-gas interface in the graph-
ite pores will not be interfered with, for example, by the accumula-
tion of sludge or fission products at this interface.
70

To compute the 135%e poison fraction, the 135%e concentration in the salt
must first be calculated. This is accomplished by the following rate bal-
ance:

135%e generation rate == 135% decay rate in salt
+ 135%e burnup rate in salt + 135% stripping rate (1)
+ 135%e migration rate to graphite,
where
135%e migration rate to graphite = 135%e burnup rate in graphite

+ 13%%e decay rate in graphite. (2)

At a given power level the left side of Eg. (1) is a constant, and
the right side is a function of the 135%e concentration in the salt.
After the concentration is computed the 135%e poison fraction may then
be computed.

The results of this calculation at equilibrium are shown in Figs.
2.1l4a, b, and c, as a function of the variable indicated when all other
variables remain constant. The circle on the curve indicates the ex-
pected or design value. For this calculation the core was divided into
72 regions, and average fluxes and adjoint fluxes were used for each
region. Figure 2.14c shows that the poison fraction is considerabl
lower at low power levels. This 18 because a higher fraction of 135%e
decays at these power levels. One notable result of the calculation is
that the xenon poison fraction did not change in value when the diffu-
sivity of xenon in graphite ranged from 1077 to 5 X 1073 ft? /ur. This
is because the mass transfer coefficient from salt to graphite is con-
trolling the transfer process. Therefore, if future reactors have low
mass bransfer coefficients as in the MSRE, it may not be necessary to
purchase the more expensive low-void-fraction and low-diffusion-coefficient
graphite, if 139%e poison fraction is the only consideration. The final
measured *37Xe poison fraction may be different from these predicted values
because of the assumptions involved. As more information is gained about
the reactor system and its chemistry, the equations will be adjusted to
provide a better model for calculation of the migration in future systems.

Remote Maintenance

The activities of the remote maintenance group were dictated largely
by the condition of the reactor. During the last stages of construction

and for as long as the cell was open, attention was given to trying the
remote maintenance techniques on the installed equipment and in check-
ing to ensure and improve maintainability. Once the cells were closed
the effort was turned to recording experiences and planning for later
work. later, actual maintenance was performed in several areas. A de-
scription of this work is given below.

Practice Before Operation

 

Practice with reactor components was had in handling the pump ro-
tary element and in changing the existing graphite sample assembly for
the final unit. The sampling procedure included the handling and/or
operation of (1) an inert atmosphere in the standpipe, (2) a special
heater tool to thaw out a frozen salt annulus around the outside of the
sample holddown assembly, (3) disconnects, valves, and flanges inside
the standpipe, (4) stowing the holddown assembly, and (5) the sample it~
self. In addition to these a limited visual inspection of the core was
conducted using a 7/8-in.-diam scope. A special fitting had to be in-
stalled in the strainer basket above the core to accommodate the revised
sample assembly.

The pump rotary element was lifted out of the cell for inspection
using the lifting yoke and crane with in-cell direct guiding. During
the 1ift, clearances of all the auxiliary eguipment were observed and
points where damaging interferences could occur were noted. The unit
was reinstalled by remote means using the view afforded through the port-
able maintenance shield. The process of torguelng up the twenty-two 1-
1/2-in.-diam bolts in the pump's lower flange was started in the portable
shield but was finished with direct means to save time in the reassembly
process. Whnlle set up in this area, representative electrical and ther-
mocouple disconnects, pump-bowl heaters, and auxiliary flanges were han-
dled with the long-handled tools.

Procedures were revised, and in cases like the pump, graphite sam-
pling, and the control rods were written up in minute detail. Tabula-
tions were prepared relating heaters, thermocouples, spare disconnects,
and other equipment with shield-block locations and elevations. Additional
tools were designed, and some existing tools were revised.

Maintenance of Radioactive Systems

 

In January, after a short period of power operation, it was necessary
to use remote maintenance on a number of tasks. Table 2.1 shows the op-
erations which were done and the actual time and manpower used. Radiation
levels were significantly lower than those which are anticipated after
prolonged power operation. While this required only minimal shielding,
enough of the shielding was used for the operations with the control rod
and. PCV 522 to provide experience in setting up and in using the tools
through the portable shielding. Although PCV 522 and its filter assembly
was quite a large radioactive source, 100 r/hr at the cuter surface of
the filter, no significant personnel exposure was encountered. In general
the tools, techniques, and previously made preparabllons proved more than
adequate. In some cases it was necessary to fabricate special tools or
revise existing ones, but these cases did not hold up progress to any
great extent. Good cooperation between management, reactor operations,
maintenance planning, health physics, and the craft forces contributed
toward efficient and smoothly run operations.

Molten-8alt Pump Operation in the Prototype Pump Test Facility. The

 

modifications’ to the test loop were completed. The venturi flowmeter
was relocated upstream of the orifice flow restriction, and a new flow-
straightening section was installed near the pump discharge. The new
flow straightener was modified to provide additional weld attachment of
the blades inside the pipe. The new arrangement of the system is shown
in Fig. 2.15.

Two test runs were made with the prototype pump circulating the salt

first run covered a period of 165 hr to provide hot shakedown of the im-
peller (13-in.-0D) for the fuel pump spare rotary element. The other
run covered a period of 166 hr to provide shakedown of the drive motor
for the spare coolant pump.

The prototype pump is being prepared for test with an 11~1/2-in. im-
peller., Measurements will be made with the radiation densitometer to
determine the undissolved gas content of the circulating salt. Other
tests will be made in the pump tank off-gas circuit in connection with
the plugging incidents experienced at the MORE.

Pump Rotary Element Modification. The spare rotary element for the
fuel salt pump was modified to provide a positive seal against leakage
of oil from the catch basin past the outside of the shield plug and into
the pump tank. Previously, a solid copper O-ring compressed between the
bearing housing and shield plug was used to provide the seal. Incidents
have occurred wherein oil leaked past the O-ring. Cross-sectional views
of the part of the pump which includes the modifications are shown In Fig.
2.16. The larger section shows the relationships between the pump shaft,
the shaft lower seal, bearing housing, catch basin, shield plug, and the
purnp bank. The exploded views indicate the nature of the modification.
Positive containment of the oll is obtained by providing a seal weld be-
tween the bearing housing and the shield plug. The rotary element is
being assembled for cold shakedown, and after satisfactory operation
will be prepared for MERE use and stored. The spare rotary element for
the coolant pump will receive the same modification.

 

Lubrication System. Modified Jet pumps * were installed in the re-
turn oil lines of the MSRE salt pump lubrication systems.

The lubrication pump endurance test? was continued, and the pump
has now operated continuously for 22,622 hr circulating oil at 160°F
and. 70 gpm.

MK-2 Fuel Pump. The pump tank design was completed, and it is being
reviewed.

Drive Motors. A new design was completed for the containment vessel
for the drive motors of the MSRE salt pumps. It provides single contain-
ment for the electrical power penetrations, in contrast to the double con-
taimment provided in the original design. The resulting simplification
should eliminate a serious fabrication problem previously experienced with
weld-induced laminations in the vessel wall.

Other Molten-Salt Pumps

 

PK-P Fuel Pump High-Temperature Endurance Test. Endurance operation®

of thig pump was continued, and it has now operated continuously for 5160
hr circulating the salt LiF-BelF,-ThF,-UF, (65-30-4-1 mole %) at 1200°F,
800 gpm, and 1650 rpm.

with the test previous to this one,” two of the snap rings for the bear-
ing sleeve gimbals support were lost and the other two were only loosely
retained. Whether the bearing seizure or loss of the snap rings occurred
first 1s a moot question. The design of the gimbals support is being

be retained by plugs tack-welded at their outer ends.

Instrument Development

 

Ultrasonic Single-Point Molten-S8Salt Level Probe

 

As no fuel has been processed during the last report period, the
ultrasonic level probe installed in the MSRE fuel storage tank®® has not
been used.

Efforts to correct this instrument's deficiencies have been unsuc-
cessful... The excitation oscillator which had proved so unstable was
modified considerably (using information supplied by the manufacturer)
in an attempt to eliminate its excessive frequency drift. These modi-
fications made no improvement in the stability of the oscillator. As
the design and success of other intended modifications depended upon the
stability of this component, none of them have been attempted. To cor-
rect this situation, the ORNL Instrumentation and Controls Division Flec-
tronic Design Group has been requested to investigate the electronic equip-
ment asscciated with the instrument and make recommendations as to the
most practical action to take.

High-Temperature NaK-Filled Differential-Pressure [Transmitter

 

The coolant-galt system flow transmitter that falled in service at
the MOREYL, 12,13 yas refilled with silicone oil and tested with the seals
at room temperature. Frior to refilling the transmitter body, a vacuum
pump wag connected to the instrument in such a manner that the pressure
could be reduced on the process side of both seals and both sides of the
gilicone~filled body at the same time. Liquid traps were installed in
the body evacuation lines to catch any oil that might be forced out of
the transmitter body by the expansion of trapped gas during evacuation.
When the pressure was reduced to 28 in. Hg vacuum (the lowest pressure
attainable with the system at that time), oil was forced from the caplil-
laries: 8.2 ml from the low-pressure side of the transmitter, and 15.8 ml
from the high-pressure side. This indicates that there was gas trapped
in both sides of the transmitter body, and that the amounts trapped were
unequal. The exact amount of gas trapped cannot be calculated from the
amounts of oll caught in the containers, because the capillaries are not
connected to the two sides of the transmitter body in the same horizontal
plane. After it was refilled, the temperature sensitivity of the instru-
ment was 1 in. (water column) change in indicated output for each degree
Fahrenheit change in ambient temperature. This sensitivity 1s greatly
reduced from that observed prior to refilling but is still excessive.

All the above testing was done with the seals and transmitter body
ab room temperature. The seals are now being heated to 1200°F, at which
temperature the test will be continued.
78

The new NaK-filled differential-pressure transmitter ordered as a
spare for the MSRE is scheduled for delivery in March.

Float-Type Molten-8alt level Transmitter

 

Performance of the ball-float-type transmitter installed on the MSRE
coolant-salt pumpt? continues to be satisfactory. The necessary actions
have been completed to correct the previously reported errors in calibra-
tion.t4/1% As these were calculated corrections, some additional future
adjustment may be required.

The hall-float level transmitter on the MSRE pump test loop con-
tinues to operate satisfactorily, although on one fill the float would
not rise until the temperature of the heater on the bottom of the float
chamber was increased. Either uamelted salt or curvature of the bottom
inside the float chamber may now be assumed to be the cause of this stick-
ing. A previous inspection of the core tube showed no deposits that would
cause it to stick in the core chamber. The bottom inside curvature of the
float chamber on the MSRE pump test loop fits the curved bottom of the
float very well and may block the entrance of the molten salt into the
chamber. This design error was noted prior to the fabrication of the
float chamber for the MSRE and corrected on the assumption that this
valving action might occur. The bottom of the float chamber was flat-
tened so that the round-bottom float could not block the flow of the
molten salt into the chamber.

Except for detailing of the differential transformer assembly, de-
sign of the ball-float transmitter installation in the MK-2 MSRE fuel
circulating pump has been completed.

One of the prototype ball-float level transmitterst® installed on

the level test loop completed four years of operation at temperature
this month. Tt is still operating satisfactorily. The other was re-
moved last year so the ultrasonic single-point level indicator could be
installed. t was operating satisfactorily when removed.

Conductivity-Type Single-Point Molten-Salt Level Probe

 

Performance of the conductivity-type level probes installed in the
MSRE fuel, flush, and coolant drain tanks continues to be satisfactory.
There have been no further failures of excitation and signal cables on
these probes.

Single-Point Temperature Alarm Switches

Observation of the performance of 110 single-point temperature alarm
switches installed at the MSRE has continued. As reported previously?
the switch modules were reset prior to power operation of the reactor.
Data obtained from subseguent spot checks of module set points indicated
79

that a few modules had shifted excessively; however, these data are con-
sidered to be inconclusive because records indicated that the modules may
have been readjusted. Some additional cases of dual set points were dis-
covered, and corrected. Routine checks and observations of module perfor-
mance will be continued until sufficient data are obtained to permit an
accurate evaluation of the reliability of these devices.

Helium Control Valve Trim Replacement

Testing of alternate material combinations for helium control valve
trim has been terminated. Since tests had shown that all the alternate
material combinations under consideration would gall when operated in
dry helium without lubrication and that none would gall if a minute amount
of lubricant was present, 7 the valves which had failed in MSRE service
were refitted with spare trim using the original (17-4 PH plug and Stel-
lite No. 6) material combination. Close attention was given to alignment
during reassembly of the valves, and all trim was given a light coat of
machine oil before installation. All the repaired valves operated sabls-
factorily in shop tests. One of the repaired valves wag installed in the
MSRE main helium supply line and operated for several months before stick-
ing. One additional helium control valve failure (also due to sticking)
has occurred. Both valves are being disassembled and will be refitted
with spare (17-4 PH to Stellite No. 6) trim. Because the failures may
be due to evaporation of the lubricant, an attempt will be made to find
a less volatile oll or grease to use for trim lubricant. Previous at-
tempts to use graphite-base lubricants were not successful.

Thermocouple Development and Testing

 

Coolant Salt Radiator Differential Temperature Thermocouples. Noise
in the coolant salt radiator differential temperature thermocouple circuit
which was under investigationt® was finally reduced to an acceptable level.
A final check on the effects of thermocouple and lead-wire material mis-
match was made by heatlng thelr disconnects both individually and simul-~
taneously to 150°F. No readable change in the output voltage was noted.

A seven~point calibration was run on the thermocouple pair between 1040
and 1250°F, which resulted in a constant error with the outlet thermo-
couple reading 0.220 mv high with respect to the inlet thermocouple. The
resistance of the thermocouple loop was determined to be high enough to
require recalibration of the receiving instrument to maintain required
accuracy. Also, the zero of this instrument was offset to correct for the
thermocouple loop error.

 

Thermocouple Drift Tests. The checking of eight metal-sheathed
mineral-insulated Chromel-Alumel thermocouples fabricated from MSRE ma-
terial for calibration drift at 1250°F was concluded.t® All thermocouples
continued to show some drift to the end of a 26-month test period. The
final temperature equivalent drift values were between +4.7 and +6.4°F.

 
80

Performance of the temperature scanning system developed for use
at the MSRE?Y has continued to be satisfactory. The modification previ-
ously reported, ?t together with improved calibration and maintenance pro-
cedures, appears to have eliminated the calibration drift problems. Per-
Tormance of the mercury switches has been excellent. We had expected that
the switches would need frequent attention and that the mean life between
routine cleaning or repair would be about 1000 hr. The switches have given
very little trouble, and the mean life of the switches has been much greater
than 1000 hr. Since the start of operation of this system in September
1964, there have been no bearing or other mechanical failures of the five
switches installed. Four switches developed excessive noise during this
period and required cleaning and replacement of the mercury. In one of
these cases the switch failure was caused by a failure in the nitrogen
purge gas supply system. All five switches were cleaned and reconditioned
before the start of power operations as a routine precaubionary measure.

3. MSRE REACTOR ANATYSIS

least-Squares Formula for Control Rod Reactivity

 

One routine function of the MSRE data logger will be the periodic
calculation of the separate reactivity effects associated with reactor
operation above some base line, or zero-reactivity condition. For this
purpose, one of the quantities the computer must calculate is the nega-
tive reactivity corresponding to each configuration of the shim and
regulating rods. By use of a least-squares curve-fitting procedure, we
have obtained an analytical formula which closely approximates the inte-
gral curves determined from rod calibration experiments at zero power.
The Tunctional expression used for fitting the experimental curves was
determined by applying a perturbation technique to the integral ex-
pression for the rod reactivity, as outlined below.

If a reference state 1s chosen to correspond to zero rod insertion,
an expression for the static reactivity change when a single rod (or rod
group) is inserted to a position Z in a core with effective height H and
radius R is

In this formula, ¢ is the column vector of group fluxes corresponding to
the condition with the rods inserted, 36 is the row vector of adjoint
fluxes Tor the reference state, 8A is the local perturbation in the neu-
tron removal operator due to absorptions in the rods, and P is the neu-
tron production operator. This expression can also be applied if the

shim and regulating rods are inserted to different positions. To simplify
the analysis, we have assumed that the tips of the shim rods are at equal
insertions, Zi, which is always equal to or above the position of the regu-
lating rod, Zp. We further specialize the formula to two-group diffusion
theory and one dimension, corresponding to the direction of rod insertion.

experiment. While reasonably good agreement was obtained in fitting the
curve for the single (regulating) rod, poorer results were ovbained when
combinations of insertions of shim and regulating rods were considered.
The functional expression obtained from standard first-order perturbation
theory was, therefore, judged inadequate Tor representing the rod-re-
activity curves.

We have found that a significant improvement in the fit can be made

affected by the position of the regulating rod (22). The approximate

where Zg is the "zero point" insertion of the rods when withdrawn to their
upper limit, relative to the extrapolated zero of the flux distribution,
and Xj,2 are the measured rod insertions. Adequate approximations for

the parameters characterizing the unperturbed flux distribution, Zo, &,
and HI, were obtained from earlier core physics studies. The results of
this analysis are swmarized in Table 3.1 and Fig. 3.1. In Fig. 3.1 the
magnitude of the rod reactivity is plotted as a function of rod position
Tor various configurations of shim and regulating rods. The ordinate
scale in this figure 1s arbitrarily normalized to zero measured reactivity
when the reguleting rod is fully inserted and the two shim rods are withe
drawn to 51 in. The leftmost curve represents the reactivity change when
the regulating rod is moved with the shim rods fully withdrawn. The
rightmost curve represents the case when the three rods are moved in a
banked position with the tips of the rods at equal elevations. The re-
maining curves represent the reactivity change when the regulating rod

is moved with the shim rods held fixed at various intermediate positions.

The solid curves are the reactivity magnitude calculated from the least-

The points shown as solid dots are sample points deter-

mined from the experimental rod calibration curves. Over most of the
range of rod movement the calculated and measured reactivity are in

agreement within about 0.02% 3k/k.

Spatial Distribution of 135%e Poisoning in MSRE Graphite

 

To supplement the experimental studies of the behavior of noble gas
injected into the MSRE fuel,? theoretical calculations were made to de-
termine the influence of the spatial distribution of 135%e absorbed within
the graphite core. Tt is expected that the concentration of xenon in the
salt will be relatively uniform throughout the volume of circulation.
However, within the graphite pores, the !27Xe would tend to assume an
overall spatial distribution governed by the burnout rate in the neutron
flux. This distribution would be concave, with minimum concentration
occurring near the position of maximum thermal flux and maximum concen-
tration near the boundaries of the reactor core.

It is intended that the resctivity due to 135%e poisoning will be
periodically calculated during operation by use of the TRW-340 data
logger. From a practical standpoint we are limited to the use of a
relatively simple "point" kinetics model for on-line calculations.
Therefore, any corrections for the spatial distribution of the 135%e
poisoning must be predetermined from theoretical studies with a more
elaborate model of the reactor core.

If we consider a step change from one power level to another, the

correction for the spatial distribution of 39%e within the graphite
region can be determined from

(adjoint flux).

As defined by Eq. (16), W is the factor by which the 135%e reactivity
calculated according to a "point" kinetics model must be multiplied to
account for the spatial distribution of the poisoning. In this equation
the "local average" *?°Xe concentration, Ne, is the radial average over

the graphite volume associated with a single fuel channel. It is useful
to compute this quantity before performing the integrations over the
entire core graphite volume indicated in Eq. (16). Although nearly all
the xenon in the graphite would be expected to be in the pores nearest
the graphite-salt interface, this local averaging procedure can be used
because the radial variation of neutron flux across a single graphite
stringer is negligible.

We have used a one-dimensional model for the fuel channels in order
to simplify the calculations. The fuel and graphite widths corresponding
to a single channel were chosen so that the ratios of mass transfer sur-
face area to volumes were equal to those of the actual channel. The
equations governing the production and mass transfer for 135%e between
the salt and graphite were:

allowing equilibrium poisoning conditions to prevail before further in-
creasing the power. The initial "dip" in the curve representing the 5-

to 10-Mw step is a consequence of the relative time lag between the in-
crease in the burnout rate in the graphite and the increase in the pro-
duction rate of 12°Xe in the salt. Figure 3.3 gives the analogous results
for power levels descending from 10 Mw.

Further studies will be made with this theoretical model in order
to determine the sensitivity of the calculated corrections to the ef-
fective mass transfer coefficient and stripping rate, and to determine

the best method of introducing this correction into the on-line calcula-
tion of the 137Xe reactivity.

Dynamic Corrosion Studies

 

A test program is in progress to study the compatibility of struc-
tural materials with fuels and coolants of interest to the Molten-Salt
Reactor Program. Thermal convection loops described previous lyre? are
used as the standard test in this program.

Circulation of lead in a Cb—1% Zr alloy thermal convection loop?
was terminated after 5280 hr. This loop operated with a hot-leg tem-
perature of 1400°F and a 400°F AT. Metallographic examination of the
hot leg, shown in Fig. 4.1, revealed no evidence of attack; however, a
small quantity of dendritic crystals was observed in the cold leg.
Electron probe analysis indicated these crystals to be columbium, as
shown in Fig. 4.2. Mass transfer of columbium in lead has not been re-
ported previously.

Two 2-1/4% Cr—1% Mo steel thermal convection loops were started
with lead coolant to study the effect of magnesium additions on mass

temperature of 1100°F and a 200° AT. Magnesium was added to act as a
deoxidizer and an inhibitor. An original plan to include titanium in
the lead was deferred because of difficulty in making a Ti~-Pb alloy.

Two loops containing molten fluorides continued to operate without
incident. A type 304 stainless steel loop with removable specimens has
operated for 22,000 hr, and a Hastelloy N loop containing specimens of
Hastelloy N modified with 2% Cb has operated for 33,000 hr.

M3RE Material Surveillance Tests

 

Reactor Surveillance Specimens

 

Specimens of Hastelloy N and grade CGB graphite were exposed for
approximately 1100 hr to molten Fluoride salts in the core of the MSRE
during the precritical operation and the initial critical and associated
zero-power experiments. The purposes for these were: (1) to monitor
materials during these preliminary operations and (2) to be the mass
equivalent for the similar specimens that replace them for surveillance
of the power experiments.’ These specimens showed no changes as a re-
sult of exposure during these First, mild experiments.
97

The graphite specimens were nominally O.8-in.-diam by 10-in.-long
rods. They were machined from MSRE graphite, grade CGB, having a rela-
tively high concentration of cracks, with the idea that this would magnify
adverse changes that might occur in the relatively short, mild exposure.
There was essentially no salt on the graphite, and the machining marks
appeared unaltered. As in the laboratory tests, radiographs showed that
surface-connected cracks tended to be filled with salt, with no salt
penetrating into the graphite. The volume of salt in the graphite aver-~
aged 0.06% of the bulk volume of the graphite, which is approximately
one-tenth of the maximum permitted in the MORE design specifications.
The relatively small dimensions of the specimens and the presence of a
more-than-typical quantity of cracks would tend to give abnormally high
salt pickup.

The Hastelloy N specimens, in the form of tensile specimen rods,
also drained free of salt. They had lost their bright, shiny, machined
surface and had a bright, gray~white matte surface similar to that ob~
tained in hydrogen firing of the metal.

Two of the specimens were sectioned and were examined metallographi-
cally. For comparative purposes, two control specimens of the same
composition were also examined. Longitudinal and transverse sections of
the shoulder and gage-length regions of the tensile specimens were ex-
amined.

Both the tested and control specimens exhibited extremely fine-
grained microstructure (see Figs. 4.3 and 4.4). The grain boundaries in
a 0.0005-1in. band approximately 0.0005 in. below the surface of the
tested specimens were darkened. 1It appears that the boundaries were
perhaps either depleted or enriched in some unknown constituent. A
section of a tested surveillance specimen has been submitted for analysis
with the electron microprobe analyzer; however, the analysis has not been
completed yet.

A longitudinal view of the control specimen is shown in Fig. 4.5.
The microstructure of the control specimen indicates that the survell-
lance specimens were in a severely worked condition prior to testing.
During exposure in the reactor at approximately 1200°F, the alloy re-
crystallized to the smaller grain size shown in Fig. 4.3.

salts in the latter part of December 1963, end it ha as been operating
satisfactorily. This unit contains three se of g raphlte and Hastelloy
N specimens that match the sets of reactor core pecinens in the M3RE.
The function of this unit is to subject its specimens to approximately
the temperature profile and the major temperature and pressure fluctua-
tions of the reactor. These unirradiated specimens will be used to ob-
tain base-line data for those that are irradiated in the reactor.

The reactor control specimen test unlit will copy changes of the re-

the computer that monitors the MIRE. Calibration of the unit with the

Hot-Cell Metallographic Examination of Hastelloy N
from Experiment MIR-47-6 for Evidence
of Nitriding

 

 

When the MSRE is operating, the atmosphere in the reactor cell and
the drain tank cell will be nitrogen containing about 3% oxygen. There
has been some concern that the nitrogen, when ionized by radiation, will
nitride and embrittle the Hastelloy N of the reactor components. Since
the capsules in experiment ORNL MIR~-47-6 were cooled with air and with
alr and nitrogen mixtures during irradiation, we examined the bottoms of
capsules 1 and 2 for evidence of nitriding of Hastelloy under irradiation.

The capsules were contained in a copper heater block so that only
the tops and bottoms were exposed to nitrogen. Construction of the cap-
sules and the operating conditions during lrradiation have been re-~
ported. ® Unfortunately, the outer surfaces of the bottoms were damaged
during initial disassembly of the capsules at the MIR hot cells. Ma-
chined grooves on the capsule bottoms were still visible, and the bottoms

of the grooves, which were also exposed to nitrogen, were undamaged.
longitudinal sections of the bottoms from capsules 1 and 2 were examined
metallographically. Attention was centered on the bottoms of the un-
damaged grooves. A thin oxide layer was present on the exposed surface,
as shown in Fig. 4.6; however, we saw no evidence of nitriding on either
of the specimens we examined.

Pogtirradiation Metallographic Bxamination of
Capsules 1—4 from Experiment ORNL MIR-47-6

 

Four Hastelloy N capsules were irradiated in experiment ORNL MIR-47-
6. Irradiation conditions and a description of the experiment have been
reported.® Metallographic examination of the graphite cores and mo-
Iybdenum coupous, contained in capsules 1 and 4, has also been reported.”

A longitudinal section of each capsule oody, at the vapor-liguid
interface, was examined metsllographically. A transverse section of
each capsule body was also examined, and the wall thickness was measured.
Two unirradiated control capsules and a section from an as-fabricated
capsule were also examined. One of the control capsules had been bested
adiated capsules,

oub-of-pile under conditions similar to those for the irr
and the other capsule was a spare for the lrradiation capsules.

during irradiation. A comparison of the wall thickness of the control

capsules and the irradiated capsules is shown in Table 4.1.

There was no apparent change in wall thickness of the capsules
oo

The interior surfaces of all Tour irradiated capsules were smooth,
and we saw no evidence of scale or film formation. However, the grain
boundaries at the interior surfaces of the capsule walls appeared to be
slightly enlarged and/or darkened. The effect was spotty in all four
capsules, and the depth to which grain-boundary darkening occurred was
greater in the vapor phase. Darkening occurred to a depth of approxi-
mately 5 mils in capsules 2 and 3, and slightly less in capsules 1 and 4.
We saw no evidences of grain darkening on either of the control speci-
mens, The inner surfaces of the walls from capsule 2 and from the tested
control capsule are compared in Figs. 4.7 and 4.8.

We canuvct explain what caused the grain-boundary effect. Because
of their high activity level, the specimens cannot be analyzed with the
electron microprobe. An unirradiated corrosion specimen that showed a
similar effect was examined with the electron microprobe, znd no signifi-
cant difference between the affected edge and the center of the specimen
was oObgerved.

it is highly desirable to join graphite pipes in the reactor core to
Hastelloy N headers. The basic obstacle encountered in attempting such
a Joint is the very large difference between the thermal expansion coef-
ficients of the graphite and the metal. Due to this difference, a Joint
of graphite directly brazed to Hastelloy N cracks upon cooling from the
brazing temperature. One possible method of circumventing this problem
is to make the transition with one or more materials having expansion
coefficients intermediate between those of the graphite and Hastelloy N.
This reduces the stress gradients. Thus, this program is concerned with
the development of transition pieces, as well as acceptable brazing
alloys.

Molybdenum and tungsten are two metals which have expansion coef-
ficients intermediate between those of graphite and Hastelloy N, and were
selected for further study. However, due to cost and availability con-
siderations, nearly all work was performed on molybdenum. This decision
was Turther justified by the fact that nearly all alloys which braze
molybdenum will also braze tungsten.
104

Studies are being conducted, using the newly designed transition
joint presented in Fig. 4.9. The design incorporates an 11° tapered
edge to reduce shear stresses arising from the thermal expansion differ-
ences. This technique may enable the Joint between the molybdenum
transition piece and the Hastelloy N to be made directly, that 1s, with-
out another transition. Several assemblies are being prepared for evalu-
ation of brazability and effects of thermal cycling.

The ORNL-developed brazing alloy, 35 Au—35 Ni—30 Mo (wt %), is very
useful for brazing graphite; however, transmutation of the gold may limit
its application in a high neutron flux. Consequently, a study was under-
taken to develop a gold-free brazing alloy which is compatible with molten
salts, contains a carbide former, and has a reasonably low melting point.

Tests of Graphite-Molybdenum Brazed Joint for Containing
Molten Salts Under Pressure

 

 

A first test was conducted in which a small pipe of grade CGB graph-
ite, brazed to molybdenum, contained molten fluoride salts at 700°C under
pressures of 50, 100, and 150 psig for periods of 100, 100, and 500 hr
respectively. Tals test, which operated satisfactorily despite a primi-
tive Joint design and a relatively thin-walled graphite pipe, suggests
that larger graphite-metal joints may be feasible for molten-salt breeder
reactors. Current MSBR designs have a maximum pressure difference of 30
psi across pipe walls, less than one-fifth the maximum pressure used in
this test.

The test configuration is shown in Fig. 4.10. The short graphite
pipe, 1.25 in. OD x 0.75 in. ID x 1.00 in. long, was machined from a bar
of MSRE graphite with its axis parallel with the extrusion direction of
the bar. Pure molybdenum caps were brazed to the ends of the pipe by
the Welding and Brazing Group of the Metals and Ceramics Division with
35 Au-35 Ni—30 Mo (ANM-16) (in wt %) braze, which is one of their earlier
developments in brazing alloys.

The molten salt was fed to the inside of the graphite pipe through
an Inconel tube brazed into the top molybdenum end cap (see Fig. 4.11).
The salt was pressurized by a cover gas of pure argon. A vacuum pump
maintained a pressure of <5 pn Hg in the annulus between the graphite pipe
and the protective container.

The appearance of the outside of the pipe was essentially unaltered
by the test (see Fig. 4.11b). These photographs also show the good
wetting of the brazes to the metal and graphite. A small circumferential
separation of the braze and the graphite can be seen at the bottom joint
next to the graphite. Microscopic examination indicated that the ef-
fective bonding and sealing was in the crevice between the pieces. Minor
cracking tended to be confined to the fillets. The microscopic examina-
tions, also, showed that the 35 Au-35 Ni—-30 Mo (wt %) braze wet the graph-
ite but did not penetrate its structure. The braze was brittle. It did
not show any signs of attack by the molten fluoride salt IiF-Bel,-ZrF,-
ThF4-UF, (70-23-5-1-1 mole %).

The 50 Au—50 Ni (wt %) braze used to join the molybdenum to the
Inconel salt-supply tube bonded strongly to the Inconel. In the di-
rection transverse to the rolling direction of the molybdenum, a few

molybdenum grains were pulled out at the molybdenum-braze interface.
This was not apparent in the as-brazed material and will be studied more
thoroughly as the work progresses.

The radiograph in Fig. 4.12 shows that none of the salt penetrated
the matrix of the graphite. This is consistent with past experience
with this small-pore-size, high-density grade CGB graphite used in the
MSRE.

New Grades of Graphite

 

Procurement and studies of grades of graphite potentially promising
for a molten-salt breeder reactor are in the initial stages. Attempts
are being made to obtain graphite suitable for irradiation studies in
order to secure the required irradiation exposures (1022 nvt, E > 0.18
Mev) reasonably soon. Samples of needle-coke graphite and isotropic
graphite are being tested. A needle-coke graphite was used in the MSRE
to minimize irradiation contraction and associated stresses. Isotropic

graphite has been included in these studies because it may be superior
in mechanical properties and more resistant to damage under the high ex-
posures required in the MSBR. 8» 9

A part of this effort is to obtain graphite with the configuration
required for current designs of molten-salt breeder reactors. This is
being done because the shape and size can significantly affect the final
properties that can be bullt into the graphite. Current designs require
graphite pipe nominally 4 in. OD X 3 in. ID X 8 to 12 ft long and 2-1/2
in. OD xX 1-1/2 in. ID Xx 8 to 12 ft long. Secondary attention is given
to the small-scale laboratory-produced materials.

The prime requirements of the graphite for the initial procurement
are that it have pores small enough to prevent the entry of molten salts
and that it have a low gas permeability. The pore entrance diameters
should be less than 0.5 pu, and permeability to helium at 1 atm of pres-
sure should approach 1077 cm? /sec. The suppliers currently propose ma-
terial with a permeability in the range of 107° to 1072 cm?/sec, with
the higher values being favored.

To date we have obtained graphite samples from the Carbon Products
Division of the Union Carbide Corporation, Great lakes Carbon Corporation,
Poco Graphite, Inc., Speer Carbon Company, Stackpole Carbon Company, and
the Y-12 Chemical Engineering Group of the Development Division.

The material obtained from the Carbon Products Division is a needle-
coke graphite, and the materials obtained from the others are isotropic
graphite. Short pieces of pipe 4.7 in. OD X 3.5 in. ID and 3.6 in.

OD X 2.5 in. ID have been supplied by the Great Lakes Carbon Corporation
and the Carbon Products Division respectively. The materials from the
others were rods or blocks.

To determine if these grades of graphite (and future grades) are

potentially useful for an MSBR, we are routinely examining them for the
entrance diameter spectrum of the accessible pores, permeability to
helium gas, permeation by molten fluoride salts, microstructure, specific
resistance, flexural strength, and coefficients of thermal expansion.
The current samples are in this stage of examination. Those that appear
to have promise will be given additional tests for purity and crystallo-
graphic development and will be included in the irradiation studies and
graphite-metal joint development mentioned previously.

Evaluation of the Effects of Irradiation on Graphite

 

Recent progress in the development of graphite for reactor use may
be applied directly in estimating properties of a graphite designed for
the MSBR. There are, of course, several unknowns which limit the ability
to state categorically that any graphite will withstand the MSBR environ-
ment. The major limitation is the lack of evidence to demonstrate that
any graphite can sustain massive doses of 1023 nvt or greater and still
109

retain its integrity. The tubular thin-wall design in the MSBR is one of
the better configurations for reducing the differential-growth problem
to within the capabilities of the graphite. The tubular shape is also
easy to fabricate and to test reliably and nondestructively in order to
ensure maximum integrity.

The properties of the most promising grade of graphite can be pro-
Jected from available grades with a Talr degree of certainty (see Table
4.2). These estimations are based primarily on properties obtained from
isotropic grades with densities required for the MSBR grade.

The magnitude of the stress generated by differential growth can be
Tairly well approximated. The main uncertainty is in the flux gradient
across the tube wall. Using the conservative estimation of 2.4 X 1024
in. in.”? nvt™! as the growth rate and a 10% change in flux across the
wall, a differential growth rate of 2.4 X 10725 in. in.” nvt™ is ob-
tained. The restraint is internal; therefore, only about half of the
differential growth is restrained, so the effective strain rate is 1.2 X
102% in. in.” nut,

The creep rate coefficient is 4 x 10727 in. in.™* psi~?t avt™t, and
the stress is simply and directly calculated to be

This stress could hardly be a cause for failure, and to obtain stresses
in excess of 100 psi would require the use of grossly unrealistic ma-
terial properties.

Failure, however, could result from the inability of the graphite
to absorb creep deformation even though the stress level is much less
than the fracture stress. For lifetimes of 1.5 x 10%?, 3 x 1073, and
6 x 1022 nvt, the strain to be absorbed would be about 1.8, 3.6, and
7.2% respectively. This corresponds to 5-, 10-, and 20-year lifetimes
with a dose rate of 9 x 10%% nv, the maximum fast flux in the present
design of the MSBR. The consideration of a strain limit for failure is
realistic; however, the strain limit for fracture has not been estab-
lished. It has been demonstrated that graphite can absorb strains in
excess of 2% in 10°? nvt without loss of mechanical integrity. There is
also some evidence that the growth rate will diminish after a 10%? nvt
dose; thus, the graphite might not be forced to absorb the total quantity
of strain calculated. Therefore 1t appears that failure by reaching a
strain limit will require at least five years of service.

The malin uncertainty, as mentioned earlier, is simply the ability of
the graphite to sustain the massive dose without loss of integrity. There
is no experimental evidence beyond 2 X 10%? nvt on which to extrapolate
the irradiation damage of graphite, so extrapolation of data to 1023 would
be pure conjecture. There are, on the other hand, several factors which
force one to be optimistic about the ability of graphite to sustain the

damage. The first factor is the recognition that in the 700°C temperature
range, the dimensional changes for the first 1022 nvt do nothing more
than repair the damage caused by cooling of the graphite from its
graphitization temperature. The additional dimensional changes of the
crystals after 1022 nvt produce stress in the graphite in the opposite
direction from that produced by the thermal cooling. In effect, the
stress produced on the basal planes will be compressive instead of
tensile. This, of course, is very much preferred in that the crystal can
sustain this type of loading more readily without cracking. The ability
of graphite to sustain very large crystal shears in this manner has been
demonstrated by irradiating pyrolytic carbons and observing shear strains
in excess of 100% without any observable cracks in the structure. This
internal deformation was so great that irregularities were evident on the
surface. Although these factors do create optimism about the ability of
graphite to sustain the irradiation dose, experimental evidence is needed
to demonstrate this ability.

Effects of Irradiation on Hastelloy N

 

The objective of this program is twofold: (1) to determine the be-
havior of the MSRE structural materials under neutron irradiation, and
(2) to investigate various ways of improving the resistance to radiation
damage by making small changes in chemistry or by specified mechanical
treatments. Hastelloy N is a complicated alloy, and we do not have
enough data for a statistical analysis; so some of our present interpre-
tations may seem contradictory. Our findings are summarized below.

1. The dependence of the creep-rupture life of Hastelloy N at
650°C on the integrated neutron flux is shown by the data in Fig. 4.13.
These data are for an air-melted heat (5065) which was irradiated cold.
The quantity f is the ratio of the rupture life of the irradiated ma-
terial to that of the unirradiated material. There seems to be a general
trend for the rate of reduction in rupture life with flux to decrease as
the stress level is decreased. Three slopes are indicated which are used
in subsequent calculations.

2. The results of the postirradiation creep tests of cold-~irradiated
specimens were used to predict the creep behavior of the alloy under
simultaneous stress and irradiation. The basic assumption made in this
treatment is that the creep-rupture curve is not altered by irradiation
except that the rupture life is reduced. Hence, one gives up a specific
fraction of life for an increment of flux. The lines drawn in Fig. 4.14
have equations of the form

RV (1)

where

_ rupture life of irradiated material +
© rupture life of unirradiated material = tg 7’

To predict what will happen when a specimen is simultaneously being
stressed and irradiated, Eq. (1) is written as

The constants A and B are evaluated from the slopes of the lines in Fig.
4.13. With a value assigned to the flux and a stress level chosen so
that tg is known, it remains to determine the value of t that satisfies
Eg. (2).

The procedure Just descrived was used to calculate the lines shown
in Fig. 4.14. The constants obtained from the lower slope appear to more
closely predict the actual test data. Points are shown on Fig. 4.14 for
two in-plle creep experiments. The agreement 1s reasonably good at
stresses above about 20,000 psi, but there is a distinct tailing off at
lower stresses. This observation 1s important in that it indicates a
longer rupture life for structural materials at the low stresses in the
MSRE than was previously predicted on the basis of a linear extrapolation.

3. The results of in-pile creep tests and postirradiation creep
tests are compared in Figs. 4.15 and 4.16. ‘The data from test ORR 140
for heat 5085 (Fig. 4.15) seem to show that the rupture life in post-
irradiation tests is considerably longer than the life in in-pile tests.
The effect increases with decreasing stress. Data for two specimens at
32,350 psi indicate that holding for several hundred hours at 630°C and
low stress after irradiation result in a longer rupture life at high
stress. The data from test ORR 138 of specimens from heat 5065, shown
in Fig. 4.16, follow the same pattern.

The specimens for the postirradiation tests in ORR 138 and 140 were
held at 650°C for about 1200 hr under little or no stress during the ir-
radiation before testing. The in-pile test specimens were heated only
during the test. It seems possible that the difference in thermal history

might account for at least part of the difference in rupture life. This
suggestion is partly supported by results of other postirradiation creep
tests that are included in Fig. 4.16. Except at 40,000 psi stress, the
rupture lives of specimens irradiated cold are generally less than those
of specimens irradiated hot. Although there are not many data for com-
parison, the rupture lives obtained by postirradiation tests of the cold-
irradiated specimens are shorter than those of the in-plle specimens.

The thermal history appears to be an important factor in determining the
creep-rupture life of irradiated Hastelloy N.

4. In both creep-rupture and tensile tests, the properties of
vacuum-melted heats have shown a large dependence on the irradiation tem-
perature, whereas alr-melted heats were less sensitive to irradiation
temperature. This ig illustrated by the data in Table 4.3. Heat 5065
was alr melted, and its creep properties show no consistent dependence
on irradiation temperature. Heats 2477 and 7304 were both vacuum melted,
and the rupture life and ductility were much worse when the material was
irradiated at 650°C than when irradiated at 150°C. This effect is
presently unexplained.

5. The effect of pretest heat treatment on the tensile properties
is shown in Table 4.4 for two heats of Hastelloy N. The range of heat
treatments used on heat 5065 had no detectable effect on the ductility.

A wider range of heat treatments was used for heat 65-552. It is apparent
that the ductility improved as the annealing temperature was increased.
The grain size increased considerably, and this would be expected to in~
crease the irradiation effect. However, some other effect, possibly re-
moval of boron from the grain boundaries by the high-temperature anneal,
seems to have been more important.

6. The effects of postirradiation annealing on the tensile proper-
ties of Hastelloy N are shown by the data in Table 4.5. Amnealing re-
duces the ductility of the air-melted heat 5065 by about a factor of 2.
The ductility of the vacuuwn melt, heat 65-552, is virtually unchanged Ty
annealing up to above 871°C. Annealing at 1200°C increases the ductility
by about a factor of 3.

Weld Studies on Hastelloy N

 

The weld studies on Hastelloy N have two general objectives: (1)
to improve the weldability so that welds have greater strength and duc-
tility, and (2) to study the effects of irradiation on the properties of
welds and investigate ways of improving their resistance to irradiation
damage. It was reported previously? that welds involving standard air-
melted heats of Hastelloy N exhibited lower rupture life and ductility at
650°C, as compared with the base metals. However, the properties could
be recovered by postweld annealing. . It was also shown that welds in-
volving vacuum-melted niaterials exhibited better properties. Electron
microprobe studies have since shown that significant silicon segregation
occurs in the weld metal. These observations have lead to the proposal

that silicon may be responsible for the poor weldability of Hastelloy WN,
and studies have been directed toward establishing this point more firmly.
Irradiation damage studies have involved determining how irradiation
changes the tensile properties. Based on the premise that a large grain
size in the weld metal may cause degradation of the properties under ir-
radiation, attempts have been made to reduce the grain size by adding
grain-refining impurities to the filler metal. The work in both of these
areas is presented briefly.

Several experimental welds were made to study the effect of silicon
on the properties of the weld metal. A single J-groove Joint configu-
ration with an included angle of 50° was selected.

A second group of experimental welds was made in an effort to refine
the weld-metal grain size and/or provide innocuous precipitates upon which
the helium (from the n,o reaction) molecules can assimilate. Experi-
mentally, this has been done by spray coating an air-melted Hastelloy N
filler metal (heat 5055) with A103. The weld made from this filler
metal was designated No. 7. For comparative purposes, weld No. 4 was
made with unsprayed, air-melted filler metal from heat 5101; weld No. 6
118

was made with a vacuum-melted filler metal (heat 65-552). The compositions
of the individual filler metals are given in Table 4.6. The compositions
of the base metal and the deposited weld metal for welds 6 and 7 are also
given in Table 4.6. As can be noted in Table 4.6, most of the Alp03 (weld
metal No. 7) was lost as a slag during welding.

The creep-rupture properties of welds 4, 6, and 7 are compared in
Fig. 4.17 with those of the base metal and weld No. 1 (duplicate of weld
No. 4). ‘The properties of weld No. 4 were quite close to those previously
observed for weld No. 1. Using weld No. 4 as a base line, weld No. 6 was
slightly weaker, and weld No. 7 was slightly stronger. The rupture
elongations at a stress of 40,000 psi were 3, 6, and 3% for weld Nos. 4,
6, and 7 respectively. All failures were observed to occur in either the
weld metal or at the fusion line. Metallographic studies are in progress
to determine the exact location of the failures.

Several of the specimens were heat treated after welding for 8 hr
at 871°C. As shown in Fig. 4.17, this treatment produced a significant
improvement in the creep strength; the ductility was also improved. A
comparison is made in Table 4.7 of the degree of improvement caused in
the different welds by postweld heat treating. The heat treatment made

Since only a few of the irradiated specimens from welds 4, 6, and 7
have been tested, it is necessary to speak in generalities concerning the
properties of these welds after irradiation. Specimens of all three welds
were irradiated in the ORR at 43°C to a thermal neutron dose of 8.5 xX 102°
nvt. Figure 4.18 compares the tensile elongation of the base metal and
weld No. 4 specimen before and after irradiation. In general, the base
metal is affected the most. The welds initially have lower ductility,
but the ductility is not reduced much by irradiation. At a test tempera-
ture of 871°C, the weld and the base metal have the same ductility. At a
strain rate of 0.002 in. in.”  min™' and a test temperature of 650°C, the
total elongations of welds 4, 6, and 7 were 5.2, 7.0, and 6.4% respec~
tively. Thus, it seems that the doped weld wire had little, if any, ef-
fect on the rupture ductility. Although postweld heat treatment improved
the unirradiated ductility, it was found that the ductilities of the as-
welded and postweld heat-treated materials were comparable after irradi-
‘ation. All the irradiated specimens failed in the weld metal. These
same welds will be evaluated further through postirradiation creep test-
ing.

Chemistry of the MSRE

 

Analyses of the Flush, Fuel, and Coolant Salts

 

It is important in molten-salt reactor operations to be able to
ascertain quickly and accurately that the uranium concentration in the
molten fuel solution conforms to design specifications and that chemical
purity of the salt is maintained.

Significant advances in analytical methods have been incorporated
into routine practice since the zero-power experiment was completed in
July 1965. The increased accuracy which is apparent in chemical analyses
shows more clearly than ever that composition and purity of the reactor
salts can be ascertained accurately and economically on a routine basis
and that current methods now afford excellent monitoring practices to
molten-salt technology.

Application of three innovations to the analysis of MSRE salts
has been made within the current report period: a new end point for
uranivm titrations, a new method for structural-metal ions, and a new
method for oxide analyses. Together, they have provided increased
assurance that the compogition of the fuel conforms to the inventory
values and reactivity balances and that the chemical purity of the
salt is even greater than could be affirmed from previous results.

Uranium Assay. Controlled-potential coulometry is used as the
primary method for determination of uranium in MSRE fuel because of
the high order of precision inherent in the method.’ From 50 to 100
Hg of uranium can be titrated with a precision of the order of less
than 1%.

Evidence was noted during the precritical and zero-power experi-
ments that a distinct bias between nominal and analytical values for
uranium existed and that the analytical values for uranium were ap-
proximately 1% lower than nominal. We inferred this phenomenon to be
a consequence of dilution of the fuel salt by flush salt, although the
amount of dilution required to rationalize the bias was of the order of
140 1b, somewhat higher than was compatible with the weigh-cell data,

A recent refinement in the method of determining the uranium end
point in the controlled-potential coulometric analysis has been made . 2
The end point nad previously been estimated as that point at which the
electrode current is reduced to 5 pa. The end-point values are now
computed by extrapolation of the reduction-potential curves to zero from
a 50-pa cutoff point. In recent control analyses in which synthetic
standards were used, the 5-Ha end point was demonstrated to have a
negative bias of 0.8%, whereas the bias for the 50-pa extrapolation end
point was zero.

Book value for the uranium concentration of the fuel salt which
is currently circulated in the MSRE is 4.646 wt %. The mean analytical
value ig 4.642 * 0.028 wt %. Thus the improvement in the method of
123

computing the uranium end point has reduced the bias between inventory
and analytical values to much less than one standard deviation of the
analytical method.

Uranium Isotopic Analysis of the MSRE Fuel. The composition of
the circulated and static fuel salts in the MSRE became compositionally
homogeneous for the first time after completion of the zero-power ex-
periment. The 2?2°U enrichment fraction of the salt circulating at zero
power was found experimentally to be 33.71 wt %, as compared with the
book value of 33.5 wb $. After circulation, the salt was drained into
the storage tanks, blending there with other fuel of lower 23301, con-
centration. No significant burnup has, as yet, occurred in the fuel.
We have had, therefore, an opportunity at the beginning of the full-
power experiment to establish an analytical base line of enrichment.
The experimental results show that the fuel now contains 2350 at 33,241
wt %, in good agreement with a calculated value of 33.2 wt %.

 

Structural -Metal Tmpurities. We have inferred that nickel is
present in the MSRE fuel salt only as a metallic phase and that iron
is also present predominantly, if nob entirely, in metallic form. ?
In an attempt to gain evidence to support this inference, samples of
the static fuel salt were obtalned from the fuel storage tanks during
the two-weck period following the zero-power experiment. The fact
that the concentrations of the structural-metal Impurities were not
found to change during this storage period led us to conclude that
thermal convection in the storage tank was adequate to prevent settling
of line metallic particles of iron and nickel in the drain tank.

 

In recent experiments a sample of the MSRE fuel was removed from
the pump bowl before significant power was generated by the reactor;
this sample was analyzed by a newly developed method using controlled-
potential voltammetry. The salt was found to contain approximately
8 to 10 ppm of iron in the divalent state. The concentration of
nickelous lon was found to be lower than is detectable by this method,
that is, less than 1 ppm. The net concentrations of iron and nickel
in the salt specimens were 131 and 40 ppm respectively. The salt
also conbaing 48 ppm of chromium in ionic form. These results are
particularly useful in that they indicate that the total concentration
of ionic structural-metal contaminants in the fuel is not greater than
58 ppm.

Oxide Analysis. Most serious of the adverse consequences of
chemical impurities in MSRE are those which would arise from contamina-
tion by oxides. Of great significance is that oxide content of the
MSKE salts can now be determined routinely and accurately at concen-
trations lower than 100 ppm by purging samples of the molten salt with
Hy, and HF, Oxide concentration is then calculated from the amount of
water recovered from the effluent gas stream.” This hydrofluorination
method for determining the concentration of oxides in molten fluorides
was applied to analysis of the MSRE flush, fuel, and coolant salts for
the first time at the beglmming of the full-power experiment. AL that
point the radioactivity of the salts was negligibly low, and analyses
could be performed in the development laboratory. As activity was
generated in the fuel salt, it became imperative that subsequent chemical
124

analyses be conducted in the High-Radiation-Ievel Analytical Facility
(HRLAT). Currently, apparatus which is to be used for routine analysis
of the oxide concentration of MSRE salts ig being installed and tested
in this facility.

The results of the analyses performed to date in the development
laboratory reveal that the oxide concentration in the MSRE flush, fuel,
and. coolant salts is 75, 95, and 40 ppm respectively. On the basis of
the results obtained by Baes and co-workers, ® saturation of the fuel
by oxide ig considered to occur at approximately 500 ppm at the reactor
operating temperature of 1200°F. The current analytical data indicate,
therefore, that the MSKE salts, which have remained in the molten state
for some ten months, have been well protected from moisture contamina-
tion during this period.

Salt Composition Analyses. The sampling schedule which was followed
at the beginning of the MSRE full-power experiment afforded the first
opportunity to obtain statistically meaningful analytical data. The
results of all chemical analyses of the MSRE salts which have been per-
formed in connection with the full-power experiments are given in
Table 5.1. The composition of the fuel salt, as indicated by these
data, is compared in Table 5.2 with the results of previous analyses.
It is apparent from these data that, hut for the still unexplained
minor bias between nominal and analytical values for lithium and
beryllium, the agreement between inventory records and analytical re-
sults is excellent.

 

Examination of Materials from the MSRE Off-Gas System

 

The program for bringing the MSRE to full-power operation has
been interrupted on two recent occasions by flow restrictions in the
off-gas system. Symptoms of plugging became pronounced in each case
after about 12 hr of operation at 1 Mw. Small specimens of the materials
which were suspected to have caused plugging were removed from the
affected parts of the off-gas system and subjected to various tests
in an attempt to determine the reasons for flow restrictions. TU was
assumed that chemical identification would indicate the cause of the
restrictions.

Restrictions were first noted in the capillary restrictor in line
521; at the same time the 533 check valve became inoperative. Restric-
tion was also noted in the sintered stainless steel line filter and
522 valve assemblage. In order to resume operation of the reactor, the
capillary restrictor and 533 check valve were replaced by nonrestric-
tive sections, and the filter-valve assembly was replaced. The filter
element which was removed was capable of blocking passage of more than
90% of the particulate matter of 0.7 u in diameter. It was replaced
by a filter designed to block particulates of >50 up in diameter. On
resuming operation at 1 Mw, restrictions appeared to develop in three
locations: at valve 522B, at the entries to charcoal beds 1A and 13,
and in the lines ahead of the auxiliary charcoal bed. Currently, a
specimen has been obtained only from valve 621, which controls flow
into charcoal bed 1B. Examinations and tests are still being performed

with the available specimens. Results are summarized in Table 5.3.

On the basis of the results shown in Table 5.3, we would conclude
tentatively that the restrictions in the off-gas line may be attributed
to varnish-like organic material. Gulfspin-35 1s used as the lubricatb-
ing oil for the rotary element. It is composed primarily of a mixture
of long-chain aliphatic linear and branched hydrocarbons. Recent
measurements show that its refractive index is 1.473. The refractive
index of the heaviest 10% volume fraction obtained on vacuum distillation
of the oil was found to be approximately 1.50. The high refractive
index of the varnish-like materials removed from the off-gas system
suggests that radiation polymerization has produced the plugging phases.
This inference appears to be strengthened further by the observation
that the varnish-like materials appeared to have limited or no solubility
at room temperature in xylene, petroleum ether, carbon tetrachloride,
or acetone.

Uranium-Bearing Crystals in Frozen Fuel

 

X-ray diffraction studies of uranium-bearing salts from solidified
MSRE fuel and/or concentrate have yielded information of chemical
interest. A complete crystal structure analysis of "7LiF'6UF," has
shown this tetragonal substance actually to be LilUFs and to have a
basically different structure from the rhombohedral compounds which do
have the 7:6 ratio. Compounds of the latter stoichicmetry do not
appear in the present fuel mixtures.

In LiUVFs5, each U*" ion is coordinated by nine F ions in the shape
of a trigonal prism with each rectangular face bearing a pyramid. This
polyhedron is similar to those in Up¥s5, but different from those of
8-coordinated U*" in UF,. It is not presently known whether this dif-
ference is significant or just a coincidence of packing of F~ ions.

A determination of the structure of Li, UFg is partially completed:
the orthorhombic crystals have unit-cell dimensions a = 9.96 A, b = 9.88
A, ¢c = 5.99 A, and the space group is Pama or Pna2,. Four formula
weights of Ti,UFg in a unit cell correspond to a calculated density of
4.71 g/cm, The positions of U4T ions have been determined, bul the
other ions are yet to be located.

Physical Chemistry of Fluoride Melts

 

Vapor Presgure of Fluoride Melts

 

Apparatus was constructed to obtain vapor pressures by the carrier-
gas method in order to determine (1) vapor composition in the LiF-BeFs
system (to complement the manometric pressure data already obtained for
this system”), and (2) rare-earth vapor concentrations in equilibrium
with liquid mixtures of importance to the molten-salt reactor distilla-
tion process (from these concentrations more accurate decontamination
factors for the rare-earth fission products will be obtained).

The apparatus, shown schematically in Fig. 5.1, closely resembles
that used by Sense et al.,® for studies of fluoride melts. The reliability

of the apparatus and the efficacy of the washing procedures for remov-
ing condensed vapor were tested with pure LiF. Satisfactory agreement
with the reliable transpiration data obtained by Sense” was attained.

Three compositions of the TiF-Belby system have thus far been
investigated. The vapor-pressure data are summarized in Table 5.4,
based on the assumption that the vapor consists only of monomeric Lil
and BeFp. It should be noted that the apparent partial pressure of
LiF increases with decreasing concentration of LiF in the melt. This
behavior is consistent with the expectation that the vapor species is
predominantly a compound of LiF and Bel, such as LipsBeF, or LiBel,.

On the basis of the observed vapor composition, it appears that a
liquid composition of 88-12 mole % LiF-Bels will provide a vapor composi-
tion of 67-33 mole % TiF-BeF,. Hence 88-12 should be the correct composi-
tion in the still pot for the MSR distillation process. This melt com-
position is currently being measured to confirm that the vapor has the
composition 67-33 mole % LiF-Bel,. The latter composition would serve
as MSBR fuel solvent (this solvent will probably not contain 7rF,).

Methods for Predicting Density, Specific Heat, and Thermal Conductivity
in Molten Fluorides

 

Density. 10 geveral years ago,tl after the published data on density
of molten Tluoride had been examined, it was proposed that the simple
rule of additivity of molar volumes might be very useful Tor estimating
densities of fluoride melts, Since that time, the results of all
additional experimental investigations have been studied. The rule of
additivity of molar volumes appeared to hold quite well except for one
system; this was the NeF-UP, system? where positive deviations as
great as 6% were observed. Thus it appears that, although there may be

exceptions, the rule of additive molar volumes describes the experimental
data on molten fluorides quite well and remalns the simplest, most
accurate method for predicting densities of Tluoride melts.

To improve the method of estimation, a revised set of empirical
molar volumes is given in Table 5.5. The origin of these values is
discussed in ref. 10. For estimating a density expression of the [form

p= a + bt, (1)

first solve for densities at two temperatures by using the equation

pp =

A [v, Vv. (t)]

where ny and. M,; are the mole fraction and gram-formula weight of com-
ponent i, and Vv, (t) is the molar volume of component i at temperature t.

Substitute molar volumes from Table 5.5 at the two different temperatures
in order to obtain the two values of p,; since density is linear with
temperature, substitution of the two pairs of values of p, and t in Eq.
(1) provides the solution for the constants a and b.

Specific Heat. Examination®® of the heat -capacity measurements of
molten fluorides indicated that the heat capacity per gram-atom of melt
is approximately & cal/°C. Hence an expression similar to that of Dulong

Thermal Conductivity. A new semitheoretical expression based on

 

Bridgnan's theoryt3 of energy transport in liguids has been developed;
the derivation of the method is given in ref. 10. The expression is

 

k = 12 Hoy (4)

where k is the thermal conductivity, V is the molar volume, and {4 is
the velocity of sound in the melt; all three variables should be in

egs units. To use Eq. (4), the molar volume and velocity of sound are
necessary. Molar volume 1s easily estimated by the rule of additivity
as outlined above. The velocity of sound may he estimated from thermo-
dynamic quantities, using the expression

Oxide Solubilities in MSRE Flush Salt, Fuel Salt, and Thelr Mixtures

 

Egtimates of the oxide tolerance of MSRE flush-salt-—fuel-salt
mixtures reported previously: were based upon transpiration meagure-
ments of the following equilibria:

Ho0(g) + 2F (a) «+2027 (a) + 2ur(g) ,

Q = (Bp/By 0) [077] (6)

— 2 [i .
U = Faby 0 3 (7)

PH,0(g) + Z2rF,(d) ==%r0,(s) + 4HF(g) ,

~ ph (pe Fon?

By combining the results for reactions (6) and (7),

BeO(s) + 2F (a) = BeFy(d) + 0% (a) ,
Qpeo = Qo/%g = [077], (9)

estimates were obtained for the disgolved-oxide concentration alt Bel
saturation of 2IiF-BeF, (approximately the composition of MSRE flush
salt). For 2LiF-Bef, melts containing more than 0.1 mole /kg of Zrf, —
wherein ZrO, becomes the least-soluble oxide — reactions (6) and (8)
were combined in a similar way to obtain estimates of the concentration
of dissolved oxide at ZrO, saturation:

52002 (8) + 2F (a) ==2urm,(a) + 037 (a) ,

031d = Ql" = [mrt R107 (10)

However, these estimates were of limited accuracy, owing to difficulties
in the determination of % by the transpiration method. In particular,
this quotient was found too large to be measured with useful accuracy in
the MSRE fuel composition, and hence it was necessary to estimate the
oxlde tolerance of the fuel by extrapolation from results for fuel salt
diluted by flush salt.

During the past year, a more direct method for determining these
oxide solubilities has been adopted. A measured volume of salt, which
previously had been saturated by equilibration with excess solid ZrO;
or BeO, was passed upward through a sintered nickel filter into a heated
reaction vessel (Fig. 5.2). There it was sparged with an Ho -HE mixture
to remove the dissolved oxide as H,0. The effluent HF-H,0-H, mixture was
passed through a sodium fluoride column maintained at 90°C to remove the
unreacted HF, and then it was passed through a Karl Fischer titration
assembly where the water content was determined.

Typically, 125-g samples of salt were filtered into the upper
vessel and sparged with a gas flow of 150 em? /min at a temperature of
500°C. The HF partial pressure was 0.07 atm or less. The time required
to remove essentially all of the oxide increased as the ZrF, content
of the mixtures was Increased, but generally did not exceed 4 hr. The
blank was usually equivalent to less than 0.002 mole per kg of oxide in
the sample.
135

The results obtained by this method for simulated flush-salt—fuel-
salt mixtures (Fig. 5.3) are in reasonable agreement with previous
estimates; 2% that is, as ZrF, (present in MSEE fuel) is added to 2LiF-
BeF, (flush salt), the oxide tolerance at first falls, reaches a mini-
mum, and then rises. This behavior reflects a monotonic increase in
the solubility product 0, with ZrF, concentration (the dashed lines

shown in Fig. 5.3 indicate the behavior which would be found if ro,

remained constant). The temperature dependence of the oxide tolerance
is indicated in Fig. 5.4 for three compositions: (1) the flush salt,
(2) the approximate composition of minimum oxide tolerance, and (3)
the fuel salt.

When the present directly measured values of Yo, are combined

with previously determined” values of Q, in the expression
, 1/2
% - (Oy 10,%,) ?

improved estimates are obtained for the equilibrium quotient 2 (Table

5.6), corresponding to reaction (6). This quotient should be useful in
predicting the efficiency of oxide removal from MSRE fuel salt by HF
sparging during fuel reprocessing!’ and during oxide analysis.d®

The solubility results obtained thus far for BeQ in 2LiF-BeF, (Fig.
5.4) are somewhat above the previous values obtained by combination of
Op and Qgs™* but these new results showed considerable scatter. This

is thought to be caused by the presence of finely divided BeO which was
not filtered completely from all the samples. These meagurements are
being repeated with the use of longer equilibrium times, in the hope

that this will improve the filterability of the B20. The oxide tolerance
of 2LiF-BeF, (flush salt), indicated by the lines in Figs. 5.3 and 5.4,
represents our best estimate at present.

Separations in Molten Fluorides
Evaporative-Distillation Studies on Molten-Salt Fuel Components

Vacuum distillation separation of molten-calt fuel or fuel components
from the rare-earth fission products is an attractive method of decreas-
ing neutron losses by capture. To design process equipment for this
task, both the mass rate of distillation and the relative volatility of
the rare earths must be known for the particular salt system used.
Completed experiments concern the process demonstration planned on MSRE
fuel, but are directly applicable to any proposed thermal MSBR fuel.

For MSRE fuel, removal of the uranium by fluorination is proposed.
The fuel solvent and remaining fission products would then be fed at
the distillation rate to a vacuum still charged with LiF-BelF,-ZrF, at
that composition which will yield the fuel solvent ag distilled product;
the rare-earth fission products would concentrate in the still. The
residue would be discarded or processed, when necessitated by heat from
the fission products or concentration of rare earths in the product.

A 10-ml graphite cylinder, containing ~17 g of salt with a free
surface (when molten) of 1 em?®, was used for the still pot. This
cylinder fitted into a "I[I' shaped Hastelloy N tube heated electrically
to a given teuperature as measured by four thermocouples in the graphite
cylinder. When the desired temperature was reached, distillation was
initiated by evacuating the assembly. Vaporized sali then passed up
and over the top of the "MN" with a small portion (attributed to thermal
reflux) collecting at the base of the graphite cylinder. The product
salt condensed in a cooler (~450°C) collecting cup in the opposite leg.
Distillation was stopped by helium addition after preselected time
periods.

Mass-rate data for 'LiF weve determined first, and then MSEE solvent
was added to the LiF and distilled in aliquot portions from it. Hach
repetition brought the BeFs and ZrF, concentrations in the pot closer
to those which would yield fuel solvent (LiF-ReFs-ZrF,;, 65-30-5 mole %)
as product. After the equilibrium concentration was approached, 2200
ppm of neodymium (as NaF) was added to the still bottom, and several
distillate samples were taken. Then the neodymium concentration was
raised to 22,000 ppm, and the sequence was repeated. For both "LiF and
the nominal equilibrium composition, the effect of temperature on mass
rate was determined.

The data of Fig. 5.5 show the effect of temperature and mass rate;
single experiments show considerable scatter, so inclusive bands are
shown. The slope of the bands is consistent with the heat of vaporiza-
tion of the components and strongly suggests that ebullition does not
occur. Solvent surface heat flux is <1/100 of the available heat to
the graphite cylinder; it is doubtful that the distillation is heat
limited. The fact that the observed rate for ‘LiF is only ~10% of

The solvent for any proposed MSBR should distill at rates above

The effect of ThF, is being studied.

Effectiveness of separation from rare earths was determined by
activation analysis for neodymium in the product, the still bobtom, and
the refluxed salt deposited around the base of the graphite.

The dats are shown in Table 5.7.

Bffective Activity Coefficients by Evaporative Distillation

 

Evaporation into a vacuum from a quiescent molten-salt mixture of
low vapor pressures should not permit vapor-ligquid equilibrium at the
surface of the melt; transport from the surface should be controlled
by the evaporation rates of the individual components, The amount
vaporized is a function of the equilibrium vapor pressure, molecular
mass, temperature, and surface area; according to Langmuir, *?

Proceeding with this technique, the data shown in Fig. 5.6 have

Although internal consistency exists, the values are dependent on
vapor-pressure data for the pure components. Calculations were made
using the values (P°) for the pure components shown in Table 5.8. The
least-precise measurements are from MSRE-solvent distillations; these
are included to substantiate the surmise that when ZrF, is included in
the melt, it effectively removes LiF from the solvent. The 1000°C
LiF-Bel, line has been extended to 100 mole % IiF, since the initial
Li¥-BeFs-ZrF, experiment contained <0.35 mole % 7ZrF,, a quantity so
small that the system can be assumed to be LiF-BeFp. On the other hand,
as 7ZrF, builds up in the mixed system (to approximately 3 mole %), en-
hancement of the BeF, activity is noted; this is consistent with re-
sults from MSRE solvent (LiF-BeF,-ZrF,. 65-30-5 mole 9% initially).

The temperatures reported are those of the bulk melt, and 1It is rec-
cgnized that the surface temperature may be significantly lower,

causing an indeterminate {for the present) error. Both surface-tempera-
ture effects and the pure LiF-7ZrF, system are being studied. It is
interesting to note that the assumption of unit activity coefficient
for LiF does not lead to incompatibility with the data of others.

volatile fission products. When this simulated fuel mixture is contacted
with a molten bismuth-lithium mixture, rare earths are reduced to their
elemental valence states and are dissolved in the molten-metal phase.
Experimental studies conducted thus far have examined the distribution
off rare earths between the two liquid phases as functions of the
lithium concentration in the metal phase. Subsequent experiments will
elaborate on these Tindings and will examine the back extraction of
rare earths from the liquid metal into a second salt mixture. The
removal of rare earths from the reactor fuel, followed by their concen-
tration in a solid, disposable salt mixture will constitute the re-
processing method.

Fluoride starting materials were prepared in nickel equipment by
adding sufficient rare-earth fluoride to approximately 2 kg of the sol-
vent, LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %), to attain a rare-earth concentration of
about 10 * m.f. in the salt phase. When possible, a selected radio-
isotope of the rare earth was added for analytical purposes. The mixture
was treated with an HF-H, mixture at 600°C to remove oxide impurities
and at 700°C with Hp, alone to reduce concentrations of structural-metal
difluorides in the fluoride melt. The bismuth was purified by sparging
the 2.35-kg batch with Hp at 600°C to remove oxide impurities. The
bismuth purification was carried out in the experimental extraction
vessel of type 304L stainless steel lined with low-carbon steel. Follow-
ing the materials-preparation phase of the experiment, the fluoride mix-
ture was transferred as a liguid to the extraction vessel. Lithium
metal was added directly to the metal phase without prior contact with
the salt phase; this was done through a loading port that extended to
near the bottom of the extraction vessel. TLithium, for incremental
additions to the experiment, was freshly cut and weighed under mineral
oil, affixed to a small-dismeter steel rod, rinsed in benzene, and
dried in the Tlowing inert atmosphere of the loading port prior to its
143

insertion and dissolution in the molten bismuth. Filtered samples of
each phage were taken under assumed equilibrium conditions (approxi-
mately 2-hr periods) after each addition of lithium. Radiochemical
analyses of each phase for rare-earth gamma activity and spectrographic
analyses of the metal phase for rare-earth and lithium concentrations
provided data for calculating the distribution of the rare earth in the
system and its dependence on the lithium concentration of the metal
phase.

In experiments conducted thus far, the distributions of lanthanum,
cerium, neodymium, samarium, and europium in the extraction system have
been examined separately, but under essentially comparative conditions.

A summary of these results, illustrated in Fig. 5.7, shows that a
mixture of bismuth containing 0.02 m,f. of lithium metal sufficed for
removing essentially all cerium, lanthanum, and neodymium and substantial
quantities of samarium and europium from the barren fuel szclvent. In
all of the experiments, rare earths that were reduced from solution in
the salt phase were found as dissolved components of the metal phase.

Bach incremental addition of lithium to the system resulted in a
near~linear increase in the concentration of lithium found in the metal
phase. However, this dissolved quantity accounted for only 25 to 50%
of the amount added to the system. The results of a blank extraction
experiment in which rare earths were omitted from the system could not
be distinguished from thoge obtained when rare earths vere present.
Bach incremental addition of lithium to an extraction system was an
approximate threefold excess over the amount required for the stoichio-
metric reduction of all of the rare earth contained in the experiment.

In earlier experiments, beryllium metal was successfully used in
place of lithium metal for the reduction of rare earths. Spectrographic
analyses of the metal phase also showed that the lithium concentration
in bismuth increased as the extraction of rare earths proceeded. These
results implied that the reaction

was of significance to the reduction of rare earths. Accordingly,
lithium was used as a soluble component in the metal phase in place
of beryllium, which is not soluble in either liquid phase.

The reduction of rare-carth fluorides by lithium is expected to
proceed by the reaction
ay HI .
mri® + (RE) =RE + mat,
where m is the effective valence of the rare-earth cation. If unit
activities prevail for all metal species in the salt phase and for all
ionic species in the metal phase, then the activity of lithium dissolved
in the metal phasc can be expressed as a function of other activities
in the system as

BR m

Ti K_ (aq) calt

 

By assuming that the activity of LiF and the activity coefficients of
119, REC, and RE remain constant, the dependence of rare-earth distri-
bution on the lithium concentration can be expressed as

Distribution of Rare Earths Between LiF-BeFs (66-34 Mole %) and Bismuth

Although the apparent fractional exponents for the reduction re-
actions are as yet unexplained, the results are in rough agreement with
the occurrence of lanthanum, cerium, and neodymium as trivalent ions in
the salt mixture; samarium and europium are probably reduced to their
divalent states prior to their extraction into the metal phase.

Removal of Protactinium

Removal of Protactinium from Molten Fluorides by Oxide Precipita-
tion. Since a single-region molten-salt breeder reactor would in-
corporate the fertile material in the reactor fuel mixbure, chemical
reprocessing schemes for recovering 2337 could be made more effective
if 233pa, its precursor, could be removed without alteration of the
relatively large uranium concentration in the fuel mixture. The pre-
cipitation of an oxide of protactinium by the deliberate addition of
oxide jon may provide the basis for such a reprocessing method if the
simultaneous precipitation of UO can be avoided. Previous studies
have demonstrated the chemical feasibility of oxide precipitation for
removing protactinium from a fluoride mixture, LiF-BeF,-ThF, (67-18-15
mole %), proposed as the blanket of a two-region molten-salt breeder
reactor.?t

In the fluoride fuel mixture of the MSRE, sufficient ZrF, has been
added to accommodate gross oxide contamination without logs of uranium
from solution as UOsz. Harlier studies had demonstrated that UO, would
not precipitate at 700°C from the solvent, LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) with
added UF, and ZrF,, until the concentration ratio of ZrF, to UF,
dropped below about 1.5.22 Therefore a preliminary study was made of
the precipitation of Pal; from a fluoride mixture known to have ZrO;
as the stable oxide phase.??3

The fluoride mixture consisted of TiF-ReF, (66-34 mole %) with

added ZrF, equivalent to 0.5 mole of zirconium per kilogram of salt
mixture, About 1 me of ?33Pa was included in the salt preparation as

 
146

irradiated ThOp. The mixture was pretreated with anhydrous HF and Hp
to convert oxides to fluorides.

The deliberate introduction of solid-phase oxide to the melt was
made by adding ZrO; in small increments. Filtered samples of the salt
mixture were taken at assumed equilibrium conditions after each oxide
addition and were analyzed for 233pg by gamma spectrometry. The results
of these analyses showed that approximately 80% of the 233pg activivy
was removed after the addition of about 67.5 g of ZrO, (equivalent to
0.125 mole per kilogram of sall) to the mixture.

IT protactinium either formed a labile solid solution with ZrO
or was removed from solution on the salt mixture by surface adsorption
on 2r0,, then its distribution coefficient should have remained constant.
The fraction of protactinium remaining in the liquid phase could then
be expressed as a linear function of added ZrO; by the equation

B=
1 Ep, 1+ (DW _ 0) Wor, (16)

where D = [Pa] Fo, = fraction of Pa in the salt, and W

oxiae’ [Fel 1p P
is the welght of the designated phase. An interpretation of the experi-
mental data according to this linear function, shown in Fig. 5.9,

culated value of about 237. The data further suggest that about 7 g

was otherwise lost from the reaction mixture. Further experiments will
include studies of the effect of ZrO, surface area on protactinium re-
moval from salt mixtures proposed for a single-region molten-salt breeder

Removal of Protactinium from Molten Fluorides by Reduction Processes.

 

The effective recovery of 233pa from a molten-salt breeder reactor will
provide more economic production of fissionable °32U by substantially
reducing blanket inventory and equipment costs and by improving neutron
utilization. Accordingly, chemical development efforts supporting the
reference-design MSBR are concerned with the removal of protactinium
from the blanket mixture, LiF-BeFp~-ThF, (73-2-25 mole %), by methods
which can be feasibly adapted as chemical processes. An experimental
program has been initiated to study the reduction of protactinium fluo-
rides from this salt mixture by molten lead or bismuth saturated with
thorium metal at about 400°C. It was hoped that protactinium, as Pal,
in the salt phase, would be reduced to its metallic state by thorium
metal and could be recovered. in the molten lead or bismuth.

The primary objective of initial experiments with this program hag
been the study of protactinium removal from the salt phase of the ex-
traction system. For these experiments sufficient %3°Pa was obtained
Tor radiochemical analysis by neutron irradiation of a small quantity
of ThO,. The simulated blanket mixture was prepared from 1ts couponents,
together with the irradiated ThO,, in nickel equipment. This mixture
was treated at 600°C with an HF-H, mixture (1:10 volume ratio) to re-
move oxide ion and at 700°C with Hy alone to reduce structural-metal
impurities. The metal-phase extractant, lead or bismuth with added
thorium metal, was prepared in the extraction vessel (type 304L stain-
less steel with a low-carbon steel liner) by treatment with Hy, at 600°C.
The extraction experiments were started by transferring a known quantity
of the prepared salt mixture into the extraction vessel containing the
metal-phase extractant. Filtered samples of the salt phase were taken
periodically for radiochemical analysis of dissolved protactinium. In
each experiment, °3°Pa was rapidly removed from the salt phase and
remained absent from the solution during the approximately 100 hr at
600°C while tests were made. Subsequent hydrofluorination of the ex-
traction system with an HF-Hp mixture (1:20 volume ratio) showed that
233pa could be rapidly and almost quantitatively returned to solution
in the salt phase.

Typical results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 5.10. In
this experiment, thorium metal wag added after the salt mixture was
introduced into the extraction vessel to demonstrate the necessity of
the reduction reaction.

The objective of experiments now in progress is to examine methods
for recovering ®33py from the extraction system. The proposed use of
macro quantities of 23ipg may be required to circumvent the anticipated
adsorption of the micro quantities of 233pg, currently used, on the
walls of the container, or on other insoluble species in the system.
148

Additional studies of the deliberate precipitation and adsorption of
233py on solid, stationary beds such as steel wool will be made for
comparative evaluation.

Solubility of Thorium in Molten Lead. Current studies of tae re-
moval of protactinium from a molten fluoride mixture, which simulates
the blanket of the reference-design MSBR, have been directed toward
the development of 2 liquid-liquid extraction process. The metho.
proposes that protactinium, as PaF, in a salt phase, can be reduced to
its metallic state and extracted into a molten metal phase. dhe possible
use of a molten mixture of thorium in lead would provide a convenient
method for combining the reducing agent with the metal-phase extractant
and for replenishing thorium to the fluoride blanket mixture. The
objective of this study has been to establish the solubility of thorium
in lead over the temperature range of interest to this program and to
provide a lead-thorium solution of known composition for subsequent
protactinium extraction experiments.

 

The experimental mixture, contained in low-carbon steel, consisted
of approximately 3 kg of lead and 100 g of thorium-metal chips. Values
for the solubility of thorium were obtained by analyses of filtered
samples withdrawn from the melt at selected temperatures over the
interval 400 to 600°C under assuwied equilibrium conditions. Samples
were withdrawn during two heating and cooling cycles and submitted for
activation and spectrographic analyses. These results, plotted as
the logarithm of the solubility vs the reciprocal of the absolute
temperature in Fig. 5.11, indicate that the heat of solution of thorium
in lead is approximately 19 kcal/mole and that its solubility at 600°C
is about 1.85 x 10% m.f.

Protactinium Studies in the High-Alpha Molten-Salt Laboratory.
A new glove-~box facility, called the High-Alpha Mollen-Salt Laboratory,
for studies of protactinium removal from molten fluoride mixtures was
described in the previous progress report .?* Experiments on extraction
of protactinium from a breeder-blanket mixture, LiF-ThF, (73-27 mole %),
by liquid-metal extraction at the tracer level (fraction of a part per
billion parts of 223Pa) are described in the section "Removal of Prot-
actinium from Molten Fluoride by Reduction Processes" of this report.
A gimilar experiment with an initial concentration of about 25 ppm of
231pg in the molten fluoride mixture was conducted in the High-Alph:
Molten-Salt Laboratory to determine whether a 10° times higher protac-
tinlum concentration would result in significant differences in protac-
tinium behavior during extraction and recovery experiments. Results re-
ported here indicate that a large fraction of the reduced protactinium
disappears from molten lead in a tantalum container, in agreement with
the tracer-level experiments, but one sample indicated that 17% of the
protactinium remained after about 6 hr at 625°C.

The completed experiment, run 1-12, was conducted in several
stages, with the furnace cooled to room temperature between stages.
In the first operation a 17 M HIF solution containing 9 mg of purified
231pa was mixed with 4.0 g of irradiated ThF,, containing about 1 mc
of 2?2Pa. The salt was heated in a platinum dish to evaporate water
and HF, and the dried mixture was added to a nickel pot containing 330

of pretreated LiF-ThF, (73-27 mole %). A copper filter unit was placed
in the pot which was sealed, evacuated to 450 up pressure three times,
and filled with helium each time. The furnace was then heated with
helium flowing through the pot under a slight positive pressure. After
reaching 600°C, a mixture of HF and Hp was passed through the melt for
50 min to convert any oxide impurities to fluorides, and then the melt
was treated with Hy, for 4 hr to reduce Nils, which resulted from the
hydrofluorination, to metallic nickel. Apparently because of a Too
high I, flow rate, part of the melt splashed up to the top of the pot,
where it solidified. On attempting to remove the first filtered melt
sample, the copper filter was torn loose from the 1/8-in. nickel tubing
to which it was attached, and the copper filter fell back into the
melt. After cooling, the cake at the top of the melt was broken up,

a 1.0-g sample was taken, the remainder of the material was returned

to the pot, and the HI-Hp treatment of the melt was repeated. No
difficulty due to the copper filter in the melt was observed.

In the second stage, the pot containing the treated Lif-ThF,
mixture was connected to a similar pot lined with tantalum and cor
taining 692 g¢ of Pb~Th alloy that had been saturated with thorium at
600°C, The molten salt was transferred to the tantalum-lined pot at
655°C through a transfer line at 600°C by application of 10 1b of helium
pressure to the salt pot. Previous efforts to effect salt transfer had
been frustrated by low temperatures in the transfer line resulting from
the high vertical temperature gradient above the furnace block, which
was metnioned in the previous report.2% A coiled heater above the
block and better insulation at the floor level of the glove box over-
came this problem. After the transfer was completed, helium sparging
was used to cause mixing of the lead and salt phases. The sparging
was interrupted at intervals to permit phasc separation. Samples of
the salt phase were removed with copper filter units, and samples of
the metal phase were normally removed with sintered stainless steel
filter units. Measurements of the total gamma activity of 1-g portions
of the galt samples after recovery from the filter units showed that
the protactinium content of the salt phase was decreasing slowly after
about 2 hr contact time between salt and metal phases. At this Time,
5.0 g of thorium~metal turnings was added to the mixture; sampling of
the two phases 75 min later showed a sharp decrease in the gross gamma
activity of the salt phase without a consequent increase in the activity
of the stainless steel sampler and their contained lead-phasec sample.

A further 3-hr contact time failed to produce a significant change in
the activity of the samples with one exception: a sample of the metal
phase inadvertently obtained in a copper sampler showed a significantly
higher activity level, later confirmed by 231py analyses, than the
stainless steel filtered samples taken before and after thc copper
samples. The furnace was then allowed to cool to room temperature.

Finally, the lead phase was transferred to an unlined nickel pot
containing LiF-Thl, of the same composition used previously but with-
out protactinium. A mixture of hydrogen and anhydrous II was bubbled
through the lead and salt phases in an effort to convert metallic
protactinium in the lead to PaF, and transfer it to the salt phase.
Time limitations prevented a thorough test of this procedure.
Data obtained in the above-described experiment, run 1-12, are
shown in Table 5.9. The gross gamma values were obtained by weighing a
sample, usually 1.000 * 0.002 g, placing it in a small glass vial, seal-~
ing the vial in a plastic envelope as it was removed from the glove box,
and then placing the envelope over a sodium iodide crystal that was
connected to an RIDL scaler. These samples were then sent for solution
and analysis by the alpha-pulse-height method to determine their 231pg
content. The whole metal samples were counted for gross gamma activity
in a similar manner. The stainless steel samplers and their lead con-
tents were dissolved separately, and 221Pa analyses were made on the
solutions; but the copper sampler was dissolved along with the lead
sample that it contained. The amount of lead in each sampler was also
determined.

The data in Table 5.9 confirm the conclusion, based on earlier
experiments with tracer concentrations of #32Pa (see "Removal of Prot-
actinium from Molten Fluorides by Oxide Precipitation,” this report),
that protactinium fluoride is reduced to the metallic state by thorium
dissolved in lead. It further appears that most of the protactinium
does not stay dissolved in the lead phase long enough to permit transfer
of the lead to another container for recovery of the protactinium by
hydrofluorination, but a small fraction of the protactinium was ap-
parently recovered in this fashion.

The variable concentration of protactinium in the lead, small in
all cases as compared with the amount in the stainless steel samplers,

may indicate that the tendency of protactinium to absorb on, or alloy
with, iron causes the protactinium to be removed from the lead sample
during its passage through the sintered stainless steel filter material.
An effort was made to remove any protactinium-containing material adher-
ing to the outside wall of the samplers after they cooled to room temper-
ature prior to analysis. They were scraped and also given an acid
treatment before they were dissolved. It is not clear, at present,

why the lead-containing copper sampler showed a much higher protactinium
content than the samples obtained with stainless steel samplers, but

it seems significant that this sample indicated that 17% of the pro-
tactinium remained in the lead after almost © hr in contact with tantalum
ab 625°C.

The transfer of a small fraction of the protactinium from the lead
phase to a molten Tluoride mixture by HF treatment, as indicated by
preliminary results, is encouraging, but means of preventing loss of
the major part of the protactinium by adsorption on or alloying with
container walls or other materials obviously will be sought in continu-
ing experiments.

Radiation Chemistry

In-Pile Molten-3alt Irradiation Rxperiment

 

Design, development, and fabrication of the in~pile molten-saltl
experiment continued. Modifications to beam hole HN-1 in the ORR and
installation of experimental equipment are scheduled to begin early in
April, and in-pile operation of the first irradiation experiment will
begin in June 1966.

Auxiliary equipment needed to modify beam hole HN-1 for the molten=~
salt experiments has been fabricated. This equipment consists of (1) a
new aluminum beam-hole liner, (2) a beam-hole extension sleeve, and (3)
an equipment chamber, located at the face of the reactor shielding,
which will contain tanks and valves required to remove salt samples
and add makeup salt to the autoclave, during in-pile operation.

Component parts of the experiment package which have been fab-
ricated are the shield plug, the loop container can, and the connector,
as shown in Fig. 5.12. All component parts of the thermal loop have
been fabricated and are being assembled. A photograph of the partially
assembled thermal-loop experiment is shown in Fig. 5.13. The 12-ft-long
sample line with electric heating elements, which are bonded to the
sample line by means of nickel metal spray, has also been completed
along with the main loop-heater-cooler unit, The healter-cooler-unit
design, previously described, ?? has been changed by substituting cool-
ing tubes of Zircaloy-2 instead of stainless steel and Zircaloy-2 for
the heater-cooler jacket in lieu of graphite, This change was made to
reduce the attenuation of neutron flux and to provide for improve-
ments in the efficiency and operational Tlexibility of the heater-cooler
unit by using a Zircaloy-2 metal-spraying technique to attach the heaters
and cooling coils.

Development and Evaluation of Methods for the
Analysis of the MSRE Fuel

 

 

Determination of Oxide in MSRE Fuel

 

The study? © of hydrofluorination as a way to determine oxide in MSEE
salts was continued. This method?? is based on the reaction

0%" + 2HF(g) =2H,0(g) + 2F ,

which occurs when a molten-salt sample 1s purged with an Hy-HF gas
mixture. The amount of water evolved is taken as a measure of the
quantity of oxide in the molten-salt sample. Data have been reported
previously? 7 for the Karl Fischer titration of the water evolved from
standard additions of ZrO, and UO, to a 50-g fuel melt.

Figure 5.14 is a schematic flow diagram of the hydrofluorination
apparatus now being used. Since it would be difficult to perform the
Karl Fischer titration in the hot cell, a P,0, water electrolysis cell
(Beckmann moisture-monitor cell with rhodium electrodes) was installed
in a component test facility to monitor the effluent-gas stream from
the hydrofluorinator for water.

To establish the conditions necessary to use the electrolysis cell
as a water monitor, ZrO, samples were added to 50 g of MSRE fuel in the
hydrofluorinator. Because there is a maximum rate of water electrolysis
beyond which the cell may be damaged, it was necessary to split the
effluent-gas stream and to pass only a portion of it through the cell.
After the optimum gas pressures and flow rates were established, the
results given in Table 5.10 were obtained.

Figure 5.15 1s a recording of the water evolved from two standard
additions of ZrOp to a fuel sample. The first two peaks of each record-
ing result from atmospheric contaminants introduced during loading of
the ZrO, into the fuel sample and removal of contamination from the
internal metal surfaces of the apparatus. After the fuel-Zr0, sample
was melted, it was purged with Hp-HF at 625°C to evolve the oxide.

The plateau of the curve for the 139-mg ZrO, addition apparently re-
flects the limit of solubility of ZrO, in the melt.

Also, analyses were made on ~50-g portions sampled from 6 kg of
simulated molten MSRE fuel of unknown oxide concentration. These samples
were taken in copper ladles, cooled to room temperature, and then trans-
ferred to the hydrofluorinator under an inert atmosphere. Three of the
samples were exposed to the atmosphere, since the samples from the re-
actor will be exposed while being transferred to the hydrofluorinator.
The sample ladle was sealed in the hydrofluorinator with a delivery
tube spring-loaded against the surface of the salt (Fig. 5.14). An

initial purge with Ho -HF was made at a temperature below the melting
point to remove oxide from the metal surfaces and oxide contamination
from the surface of the salt. With further temperature increase, the
delivery tube was driven below the surface of the salt as it melted to
sparge the melt with Hp-HF, Table 5.11 lists the results.

We must here consider whether these results represent a quantita-
tive removal of oxide or simply a return to an original equilibrium bage
line. It may be seen by rearranging the equilibrium expression for the
reaction of oxide with HF that 1f the proportion of HF reagent in the
purge gas 1s increased, the residual-oxide concentration will be
reduced?

Because the HI reagent contalns traces of water, the HF concentration in
the influent cannot be increased independently. However, if the concen-
trations of HF and HO in the purge gas are doubled, the residual oxide
in the melt should be reduced by a factor of 2. When the pressure of

HF in the sparge gas through terminal (oxide-depleted) melts was doubled,
no additional water was obtained. Also, equilibrium constants are tem-
perature dependent, and no additional peaks were observed with tempera-
ture variations of 200°C on depleted melts.

Samples of flush and fuel salt taken during the December startup
of the reactor were analyzed for oxide in a component test facility.
Table 5.12 summarizes the results. Figure 5.16 is a recording of the
water evolved from the first fuel-salt sample taken after the fuel was
loaded into the reactor.

The results of the analyses by the hydrofluorination method were
in good agreement with those by the KBrF, procedure®® (Fig. 5.17).
The KBrF, values paralleled the trends shown by the hydrofluorination

since the pulverized samples required for the KBrF, method are easily
contaminated by atmospheric moisture.

The apparatus (Fig 5.18) designed for the determination, in the
hot cell, of the oxide in highly radioactive fuel samples is functionally
identical with the components test facility used for the analyses re-

nator is put on stream through O-ring ball joints that are closed or
opened by a remotely operated argon-actuated air piston. The valve
compartment contains the sodium fluoride trap, the capillary water
splitter, the P,05 water electrolysis cell, and the soda-lime trap for
cleaning the effluent gas stream. These components are shown in Fig.
5.19, where the cover plate has been removed. The modular construction
was chosen in hopes that any maintenance necessary can be performed
remotely. If not, any component can be removed manually in 2 to 5 min
if the hot cell is sufficiently decontaminated.

Figure 5.20 shows the disassembled hydrofluorinator. The copper
sample ladle is contained in the nickel liner, which fits into the
bottom of the hydrofluorinator. The baffles on the spring-loaded sparge
tube fit inside the liner and confine the molten salt to the liner
during the bubbling operation of the analysis. This arrangement allows
the solid sample, after analysis, to be removed from the bottom of the
hydrofluorinator and then to be disconnected at the Swagelock fitting

and discarded along with the ladle, liner, and bottom of the sparge
tube. This design affords considerable saving in cost per analysis,
because it permits the repeated use of the complete hydrofluorinator.

Figure 5.21 shows the H,-HF mixer section, which is located in the
access area behind the hot cell. The HF pressure is regulated by con-
trolling the temperature of the HF tank shown at the left. The flow
rates of the Hy and HF are controlled by nickel and platinum capillaries
respectively. This apparatus also contains safety interlocks and limit-
ing capillaries to prevent release of HF and excessive pressures inside
the hot cell.

Figure 5.22 shows the master control panel, which is located in
front of the hot cell. This panel contains the moisture recorder (not
shown), helium and hydrogen pressure controls, HF control switch, hydro-
fluorinator coupler switch, temperature recorder, furnace power controls,
and power control for the coupler-line heater.

After they were fabricated, the apparatus and auxiliary equipment
were assembled in the hot-cell mockup, and all mechanical operations
were performed successfully with Master Slave manipulators. The equip-
ment was then transferred to the laboratory and was assembled on the
bench top for trial analyses of samples. Individual components were
tested exhaustively and, when necessary, were modified or replaced to
obtain maximum dependability and to minimize hot-cell maintenance.

A final check of the splitter and cell was made by injecting a
known quantity of water into the flow system; quantitative recovery of
the water resulted. The entire system was then checked out by analyz-
ing fuel-salt samples. Satisfactory results were obtained.

The equipment is now being transferred to the hot cell and installed
therein.

Voltammetric Determination of Ionic Iron and Nickel in Molten MSRE Fuel

 

By controlled-potential voltammetry, Fe? t and nit were determined
in a 100-g sample of MSRE fuel. The sample was withdrawn from the re-
actor in enricher ladles and was transferred under an inert atmosphere
to the graphite crucible of an electrochemical cell assembly for remelt-
ing and analysis. The cell assembly and electrodes developed for
electrochemical studies of molten-fluoride salts are described else-
where.?2973% The iron and nickel in the molten fuel are suspected to be
in the metallic state, as well as in the form of soluble ionic species.
However, only in the divalent oxidation state are these metals electro-
reducible in the melt and can thus give voltammetric reduction waves.

By voltammetry and by the standard-addition technique, the concentration
of Fe?" was determined to be ~10 ppm. The concentration of Ni?" was be-
low the limit of detection by voltammetry (<1 ppm).

Average total concentrations of iron and nickel, determined by
conventional methods, are about 125 and 45 ppm respectively. Thus it
appears that most of the iron and nickel in the fuel is present in the
metallic state, probably as finely divided particles.

Chromium concentration, determined conventionally, is ~50 ppm.
Interference from uranium prevents the voltammetric determination of
chromium in the molten salt. A well-defined wave was observed that
corresponds to the reduction U(IV) —U(III). Possibly, this wave can
be used to continuously monitor uranium in the system; more work is
contemplated in this area.

Development and Evaluation of Equipment and Procedures for

Analyzing Radioactive MSRE Salt Samples

 

 

As stated earlier,>? statistical evaluation of the control data

indicated that a negative bias of approximately 0.8% existed in the
coulometric uranium results. The uranium procedure consisted primarily
of six steps.

1. Determination of blank.

2. Preparation of sample.

3. Prereduction of sample at +0.125 v vs S.C.E.

4. Reduction of uranium and copper at -0.325 v vs S.C.E.
5 Oxidation of copper at +0.125 v vs S.C.E.

6. Calculation.

In steps 1, 3, 4, and 5, the titration was allowed to proceed
until the cell current had decreased to 5 ua.

The calculation was performed using the following formula:

[(A—-B) —C — (bt/E)IDE = micrograms of uranium per test solution ,

where
A = readout voltage for uranium and copper reduction in millivolts,
B = blank of electrolyte in millivolts,
C = readout voltage for copper oxidation in millivolts,
D = 1.233 x 10 ? pg of uranium per microcoulomb,
E = coulometer calibration constant for 10-microequivalent range

in microcoulombs per millivolt,
b = background current in microamperes (5 na),
t = fime of uranium and copper reduction in seconds.

In an attempt to eliminate the bias, steps 1, 4, and 6 were
modified. The determination of the blank was eliminated. The cutoff
point for the uranium and copper reduction was changed from 5 pa to
50 pa. An X-Y recorder (Fig. 5.23) was attached to the coulometer to
monitor the titrations. When the readout voltage and cell current were
plotted on the X and Y scales, respectively, a straight line with a
negative slope was obtained after the recorder pen had reached a
maximum Y¥ value. By extrapolation of the curve (Fig. 5.24), it was
possible to obtain the readout voltage corresponding to a cell cur-
rent of O amp. Due to the error introduced by this technique, a poten-
tiometer was connected to the integrator circuit of the coulometer in
order to obtain more precise readout voltages. This necessitated
terminating the titrations at a specific end point. A cell current of
166

50 pa was found empirically to be the most practical point of termina-
tion. The coulometer was automatically turned off when the ammeter
needle indicated a cell current of 50 pa. At this point, the titration
was approximately 99% complete. This portion of the readout voltage
was taken from the potentiometer; the remaining readout voltage was
obtained by extrapolating from 50 to O pa an expanded cell current vs
readout voltage curve (Fig. 5.25). The two readings were combined to
obtain the total readout voltage for the uranium and copper reduction.
Based on more than 200 titration curves, the readout voltage represented
by the extrapolated portion of the curve was approximately 5 mv; there-
fore, the readout voltages used for the uranium and copper reductions
were obtained by adding 5 mv to the potentiometer readings. Due to the
above changes, the formula for calculating the uranium present in the
test solution then became

[(A — B) + CIDE = micrograms of uranium per test solution 3

where

= readout voltage for uranium and copper reduction in millivolts,

readout voltage for copper oxidation in millivolts,

= 5 mv (value obtained by extrapolation of the cell current vs
readout voltage curve from 50 to O pa),

D = 1.233 x 10 2? pg of uranium per microcoulomb,

E = coulometer calibration constant for 10-microequivalent range

in microcoulombs per millivolt.

QW we
ll
167

The uranium present in the test solution could be calculated,
since the voltages read out on the potentiometer were proportional to
the coulombs required in the reduction of uranium and copper and the
oxidation of copper.

Sample Analyses

From December 16, 1965, through January 26, 1966, six flush-salt
and twenty-two fuel-salt samples were received in the High-Radiation-
Level Analytical Laboratory. All 28 samples were analyzed for U, Zr,

Quality Control Program

 

The quality control program initiated prior to precritical sampling
was continued during the past period. Synthetic solutions similar to
dissolved nonradioactive fuel-salt samples were analyzed along with
each flush-salt and fuel-salt sample. Due to the relatively small
number of samples analyzed to date, the accumulated control data is
insufficient to calculate the true percent standard deviations of the
methods. The values shown in Table 5.13 were obtained during the
fourth quarter of 1965. The 2S and average values shown were obtained
by four different groups of shift personnel. Molybdenum values are not
shown in the table since it was not added to the synthetic solution.
The nickel values indicate that a positive bias exists in the method.
The values given for the coulometric uranium procedure indicate that
the negative bias was eliminated.

6. MOLTEN-SALT BREEDER REACTOR DESIGN STUDIES

Design and evaluation studies have been made of thermal molten-salt
breeder reactors (MSBR) in order to assess their economic and nuclear po-
tential and to identify the important design and development problems.
The reference reactor design presented here contains design problems re-
lated to molten-salt reactors in general.

The MSBR reference design concept is a two-region, two-fluld system,
with fuel salt separated from the blanket salt by graphite tubes. The
fuel salt consists of uranium fluoride dissolved in a mixture of lithium-
beryllium fluorides, while the blanket salt 1s a thorium-lithium fluoride
containing 27 mole % thorium fluoride. The energy generated in the re-
actor fluid is transferred to a secondary coolant-salt circuit, which
couples the reactor to a supercritical steam cycle. On-site fluoride
volatility processing is employed, leading to low unit processing costs
and economic operation as a thermal breeder reactor.

MSBR Plant Design
Flowsheet

Figure 6.1 gives the flowsheet of the 1000-Mw (electrical) MSBR
power plant. Fuel flows through the reactor at a rate of about 44,000
gpm (velocity of about 15 fps), entering the core at 1000°F and leaving
at 1300°F. The primary fuel circuit has four loops, each loop having a
pump and a primary heat exchanger. Fach of these pumps has a capacity
of about 11,000 gpm. The four blanket-salt pumps and heat exchangers,
although smaller, are similar to corresponding components in the fuel
system. The blanket salt enters the reactor vessel at 1150°F and leaves
at 1250°F. The blanket-salt pumps have a capacity of about 2000 gpm.

Pour 14,000-gpm coolant pumps circulate the sodium fluoroborate
coolant salt, which enters the shell side of the primary heat exchanger
at 850°F and leaves at 1112°F. After leaving the primary heat exchanger,
the coolant salt is further heated to 1125°F on the shell side of the
blanket~salt heat exchangers. The coolant then circulates through the
shell side of 16 once-through superheaters (4 superheaters per pump)

In addition, four 2000-gom pumps circulate a portion of the coolant
through eight reheaters.

The steam system flowsheet is essentially that of the new TVA Bull
Run plant, with modifications to increase the rating to 1000 Mw (elec-
trical) and to preheat the working fluid to 700°F prior to entering the
heat-exchanger—superheater unit. A supercritical power conversion sys-
tem is used, which is appropriate for molten~salt application and takes
advantage of the high-strength structural alloy employed. Use of a super-
critical fluid system results in an overall plant thermal efficiency of
about 45%.

Reactor Design

Figure 6.2 shows a plan view of the MSBR cell arrangement. The
reactor cell is surrounded by four shielded cells containing the super-
heaters and reheater units; these cells can be individually isolated for
maintenance. The processing cell, located adjacent to the reactor, is
divided into a high-level and a low-level activity area.

Figure 6.3 shows an elevation view of the reactor and indicates the
position of equipment in the various cells. Figure 6.4, a plan view of
the reactor cell, shows the location of the reactor, pumps, and fuel and
blanket heat exchangers. Figure 6.5 is an elevation of the reactor cell.
The Hastelloy N reactor vessel has a side wall thickness of about 1-1/4
in. and a head thickness of about 2-1/4 in.; it is designed to operate
at 1200°F and 150 psi. The plenum chambers, with 1/4-in.-thick walls,
communicate with the external heat exchangers by concentric inlet-outlet
piping. The inner pipe has slip joints to accommodate thermal expansion.
Bypass flow through these slip Joints is about 1% of the total flow. As
indicated in Fig. 6.5, the heat exchangers are suspended from the top of
the cell and are located below the reactor. Each fuel pump has a free
fluid surface and a storage volume which permit rapid drainage of fuel
fluid from the core upon loss of flow. In addition, the fuel salt can
be drained to the dump tanks when the reactor is shut down for an ex-
tended time. The entire reactor cell is kept al high temperature, while
cold "fingers" and thermal insulation surround structural support members
and all special equipment which must be kept at relatively low tempera-
tures. The control-rod drives are located above the core, and the con-
trol rods are inserted into the central region of the core.

\ REACTOR CELL HEATERS

Fig. 6.5. Elevation of Reactor Cell.

The reactor vessel, about 14 ft in diameter by about 15 ft high,
contains a 10-ft-diam core assembly composed of reentry-type graphite
fuel cells. The graphite tubes are athached to the two plenum chambers
at the bottom of the reactor with graphite-to-metal transition sleeves.
Fuel from the entrance plenum flows up fuel passages in the outer region
of the fuel cell and down through a single central passage to the exit
plenum. The fuel flows from the exit plenum to the heat exchangers, then
to the pump, and back to the reactor. A 1-1/2-ft-thick molten-salt blanket
plus a 1/4-ft-thick graphite reflector surround the core. The blanket salt
also permeates the interstices of the core lattice so that fertile material
flows through the core without mixing with the fissile fuel salt.

The MSBR requires structural integrity of the graphite fuel cell. In
order to reduce the effect of radiation damage, the fuel cells have been
177

made small to reduce the fast-flux gradient across the graphite wall.
Also, the cells are anchored only at one end to permit axial movement.
The core volume has been made large in order to reduce the flux level in
the core. In addition, the reactor is designed to permit replacement of
the entire graphite core by remote means if required.

Figure 6.6 shows a cross section of a fuel cell. Fuel fluid flows
upward through the small passages and dowimward through the large central
passage. The outside diameter of a fuel cell tube is 3.5 in.; there are
534 of these tubes spaced on a 4.8-in. trisngular pitch. The tube assem-
blies are surrounded by hexagonal blocks of moderator graphite with blanket
salt filling the interstices. The nominal core composition is 75% graphite,
18% fuel salt, and 7% blanket salt by volume.

A summary of parameter values chosen for the MSBR design is given
in Table 6.1.

Fuel Processing

The primary objectives of fuel processing are to purify and recycle
fissile and carrier components and to minimize fissile inventory while
holding losses to a low value, The fluoride volatility—vacuum distilla-
tion process fulfills these objectives through simple operations.

The core fuel is conveniently processed by fluoride volatility and
vacuum distillation. Blanket processing is accomplished by fluoride
volatility alone, and the processing cycle time is short enough to main-
tain a very low concentration of fissile material. The effluent UFg is
absorbed vy fuel salt and reduced to UF, by treatment with hydrogen to
reconstitute a fuel-salt mixture of the desired composition.

Molten-salt reactors are inherently sulted to the design of process-
ing facilities integral with the reactor plant; these facilities require
only a small amount of cell space adjacent to the reactor cell. Because
all services and equipment avallable to the reactor are available to the
processing plant and because shipping and storage charges are eliminated,
integral processing facilities permit significant savings in capital and
operating costs. Also, the processing plant inventory of fissile material
is greatly reduced, resulting in low fuel inventory charges and improved
fuel utilization characteristics for the reactor.

The principal steps in core and blanket stream processing of the
MSBR are shown in Fig. 6.7. A small side stream of each fluid is con-
tinuously withdrawn from the fuel and blanket circulating loops and is
circulated through the processing system. After processing, the decon-
taminated fluids are returned to the reactor at some convenient point —
for example, via the fuel and fertile stream storage tanks.

Fuel inventories retained in the processing plant are estimated to
be about 10% of the reactor system inventory for core processing and less
Than 1% for blanket processing.

Heat Exchange and Steam Systems

 

The structural material for all components contacted by molten salt
in the fuel, blanket, and coolant systems, including the reactor vessel,
pumps, heat exchangers, and piping and storage tanks, is Hastelloy N.

The primary heat exchangers are of the tube-and-shell type. FKach
shell contains two concentric tube bundles connected in series and at-
tached to fixed tube sheets. The fuel salt flows downward in the outer
section of tubes, enters a plenum at the bottom of the exchanger, and
then flows upward to the pump through the center section of tubes. In-
tering at the top, the coolant salt flows on the baffled shell side of
the exchanger down the central core, under the barrier that separates the
two sections, and up the outer annular section.

Since a large temperature difference exists in the two tube sec-
tions, the tube sheets at the bottom of the exchanger are not attached
to the shell. The design permits differential tube growth between the
two sections without creating troublesome stress problems. To accom~
plish this, the tube sheets are connected at the bottom of the exchanger
by a bellows-type joint. This arrangement, essentially a floating plenum,
permits enough relative motion between the central and outer tube sheets
to compensate for differential tube growth without creating intolerable
stresses in the joint, the tubes, or the pump.

The blanket heat exchangers increase the temperature of the coolant
eaving the primary core heat exchangers. Since the coolant-salt temper-
ature rise through the blanket exchangers is small and the flow rate is
relatively high, the exchangers are designed for a single shell-side pass
for the coolant salt, although two-pass flow is retained for the blanket
salt in the tubes. Straight tubes with two tube sheets are used.

The superheater 1s a U-tube U-shell exchanger using disk and donut
baffles with varying spacing. It is a long, slender exchanger having
182

relatively large baffle spacing. The baffle spacing is established by
the shell-side pressure drop and by the temperature gradient across the
tube wall and is greatest in the central portion of the exchanger, where
the temperature difference between the fluids is high. The supercritical
fluid enters the tube side of the superheater at 700°F and 3800 psi and
leaves at 1000°F and 3600 psi.

The reheaters transfer energy from the coolant salt to the working
fluid before its use in the intermediate-pressure turbine. A shell-tube
exchanger is used, producing steam at 1000°F and. 540 psi.

Since the freezing temperature of the secondary salt coolant is about
700°F, a high working-fluid inlet temperature is required. Preheaters,
along with prime fluid, are used in raising the temperature of the work-
ing fluid entering the superheaters. Prime fluid goes through a preheater
exchanger and leaves at a pressure of 3550 psi and a temperature of about
870°F. It is then injected into the feedwater in a mixing tee, producing
fluid at 700°F and 3500 psi. The pressure is then increased to about 3800
psi by a pressurizer (feedwater pump) before the fluid enters the super-
heater.

Capital Cost bstimates

 

Reactor Power Plant

Preliminary estimates of the capital cost of a 1000-Mw (electrical)
MSBR power station indicabe a direct construction cost of about $80.4
million. After applying the indirect cost factors used in the advanced
converter evaluation,’ an estimated total plant cost of $113.6 million
is obtained. A summary of plant costs is given in Table 6.2. The con-
ceptual design was not sufficiently detailed to permit a completely re-
liable estimate; however, the design and estimates were studied thoroughly
enough to make meaningful comparisons with previous converter-reactor plant
cost studies. The relatively low capital cost estimate obtained results
from the small physical size of the MSBR and the simple control reguire-
ments. The results of the study encourage the belief that the cost of
an MSBR power station will be as low as for stations utilizing other re-
actor concepts.

The operating and maintenance costs of the MSBR were not estimated.
Baged on the ground rules used in ref. 1, these costs would be about 0.3
mill /kwhr (electrical).

Fuel Reeycle Plant

The capital costs associated with fuel recycle equipment were ob-
tained by itemizing and costing the major process equipment required and
by estimating the costs of site, buildings, instrumentation, waste dis-
posal, and building services associated with fuel recycle.

Nuclear Performance and Fuel Cycle Analyses

The fuel cycle cost and the fuel yield are closely related, yet
independent in the sense that two nuclear designs can have similar costs
but significantly different yields. The objective of the nuclear design
calculations was primarily to find the conditions that gave the lowest
fuel cycle cost, and then, without appreciably increasing this cost, the
highest fuel yield.

Analysis Procedures

Calculation Method. The calculations were performed with OPIIMERC,
a combination of an optimization code with the MERC multigroup, diffusion,
equilibrium reactor code. The program MERC? calculates the nuclear per~
formance, the equilibrium concentrations of the various nuclides, in-
cluding fission products, and the fuel cycle cost for a given set of con-
ditions. OPTIMERC permits up to 20 reactor parameters to be varied, within
limits, in order to determine an optimum, by the method of steepest ascent.
The designs were optimized essentially for minimum fuel cycle cost, with
lesser weight given to maximizing the annual fuel yield. Typical param-
eters varied were the reactor dimensions, blanket thickness, fractions
of fuel and fertile salts in the core, and fuel and fertile stream proc-
essing rates.

Several equations were included in the code for approximating cer-
tain capital and operating costs that vary with the design parameters
(e.g-, capital cost of the reactor vessel, which varies with the reactor
dimensions). These costs were automatically added to the fuel cycle cost
in the optimization routine so that the optimization search would take
into account all known economic factors. However, only the fuel cycle
cost itself is reported in the results.

Modified GAM~-1-[HERMOS cross-section libraries were used. to compute
the broad group cross sections for these calculations. It was assumed
that all nuclides in the reactor system are at thelr equilibrium con-

entrations. To check this assumption, a typical reactor design was
examined to determine the operating time required for the various uranium
isotopes to approach their equilibrium concentrations from a startup with
2357, It was found that 222U and 23°U were within 95% of their equilibrium
concentrations in less than two years. Uranium-234 was within 95% of equi-
Librium after eight years, while 2367 yas within 80% after ten years.

Since the breeding performance depends mainly on the ratio of 2337 to

2357 in the fuel, the equilibrium calculation appears to be a good rep-
resentation of the lifetime performance of these reactors, even for start-
up on 2357,

Basic Assumptions

Economic. The basic economic assumptions employed in the calcula-
tions are given in Table 6.5. The values of the fissile isotopes were
taken from the current AEC price schedule.
187

The processing costs are based on those given in the section entitled
"Capital Cost Estimates" and are included in the fuel cycle costs. The
capital and operating costs were estimated separately for each stream as
a function of plant throughput, based on the volume of salt processed.

The total processing cost is assumed to be a function of the throughput
to some fractional power called the scale Tactor.

Processing. The processing scheme is that indicated in Fig. 6.7.
A fissile material loss of 0.1% per pass through processing was assumed.

In addition to the basic processing scheme employed, results were
also obtained for the case where protactinium can be removed directly
from the blanket stream. The improvement in performance under these
circumstances is a measure of the incentive to develop protactinium re-
moval ability.

Fission Product Behavior. The disposition of the various fission
products was assumed as shown in Table 6.6. The behavior of 135% and
other fission gases has a significant influence on nuclear performance.

A gas stripping system is provided to remove these gases from the fuel
salt. However, part of the xenon could diffuse into the moderator graph-
ite. Ia the calculations reported here, an 135%¢ poison fraction of 0.005
was assumed.

 

Corrosion Product Behavior. The control of corrosion products in
molten-salt fuels does not appear to be a significant problem, and the
effect of corrosion products was neglected in the nuclear calculations.
The processing method considered here can control corrosion product
buildup in the fuel.

Nuclear Design Analysis

 

The important parameters describing the MSBR design are given in
Table 6.1. Many of the parameters were basically fixed by the ground
rules for the evaluation or by the engineering design. These include
the thermal efficiency, plant factor, capital charge rate, maximum fuel
velocity, size of fuel tubes, processing costs and fissile loss rate,
and the out-of-core fuel inventory. The parameters which were optimized
by OPTIMERC were the reactor dimensions, the power density, the core
composition, including the ¢/u and Th /U ratios, and the processing rates.

Nuclear Performance. The results of the calculations for the MSBR
design are given in Table 6.7, and the neutron balance is given in Table
6.8. The basic design has the inherent advantage of no neutron losses

to structural materials other than the moderator. Except for some un-
avoidable loss of delayed neutrons in the external fuel circuit, there
is almost zero neubron leakage from the reactor because of the thick
blanket. The neutron losses to fission products ave minimized by the
availability of rapid and inexpensive integrated processing.

fuel Cycle Cost. The components of the fuel cycle cost for the MSBR
are given in Table 6.9. The main components are the fissile inventory
and processing costs. The inventory costs are rather rigid for a given
reactor design, since they are largely determined by the assumed external
fuel volume. The processing costs are, of course, a function of the
processing cycle times, one of the chief parameters optimized in this

study -

SBR Performance with Protactinium Removal Scheme. The ability to
remove protactinium directly from the blanket of the MSBR has a marked
effect on fuel yield and fuel cycle cost. This is due primarily to the
marked decrease in protactinium neutron absorptions when protactinium is
removed from the blanket region. A simple and inexpensive scheme for the
removal. of protactinium from the hlanket would give the MSBR the perfor-
mance indicated under MSBR (Pa) in Table 6.10; for comparison, the results
without protactinium removal are also given in the table.

Power Cost and Fuel Utilization Characteristics

 

Based on the above, the power cost, specific fissile inventory, and
fuel doubling time for the MSBR and MSBR (Pa) are summarized in Table 6.11.

Table 6.11 illustrates the economic advantage of MSBR's as nuclear
power plants. Also, the fuel utilization characteristics as measured by
the product of the specific inventory and the square of the doubling time
are excellent. On this basis the MSBR is comparable to a fast breeder
with a specific inventory of 3 kg/Mw (electrical) and a doubling time
of 10.5 years, while the MSBR (Pa) is comparable to the same fast breeder
with a doubling time of 6 years.

7. MOITEN-SALT REACTOR PROCESSING STUDIES

A close-coupled facility for processing the fuel and fertile streams
of a molten-salt breeder reactor (MSBR) will be an integral part of the
reactor system. Studies sre in progress for obtaining data relevant to
the engineering design of such a processing facility. The processiag
plant will operate on a side stream withdrawn from the fuel stream, which
circulates through the reactor core and the primary heat exchanger. For
a 1000-Mw (electrical) MSBR, approximately 14.1 ft’ of salt per day will
be processed, which will result in a fuel-salt cycle time of aporoxi-
mately 40 days.t

The probable method for fuel-stream and fertile~stream processing
is shown in Fig. 7.1. The salt will first be contacted with Fo, for re-
moval of uranium as volatile UPFg. Purified UFg will be obtained from the
fluorinator off-gas (consisting of UFg, excess Fp, and volatile fission
product fluorides) by use of NaF sorption. A semicontinuous vacuum
distillation will then be carried out on the remaining salt for the re-
moval of the rare earths, barium, strontium, and yttrium. These fission
products will be removed from the still in a salt volume equivalent to
0.5% of the stream. A small fraction of salt may also have to be dis-
carded at some stage in the process for removal of fission products such

as zirconium, rubidium, and cesium. The barren salt, the purified U¥g,
and the makeup salt will then be recombined. This step involves re-
duction of UFg to UF,, mixing of these streams, and sparging the result-
ant material with an Hp-HF stream. Finally, the salt mixture will be
filtered before return to the reactor.

Semicontimious Distillation

 

The present concept of the distillation step in the MSBR processing
plant will use a continuous feed stream and vapor removal; however, there
will be a buildup of less volatile fission products (FP) in a static pool
of liquid in the still, with periodic discard.’ Fission products will be
allowed to build up in the still liquid until the heal generation rate
becomes excessive, or until the liquid FP concentration becomes too large
for useful decontamination.

One measure of the decontamination achieved in the distillation
process is the relative volatility of the nonvolatile fission products
as compared with the carrier salt. The relative volatility of a non-
volatile component A compared with a more volatile component B in a mix-
ture of A and B is defined as

0 Ina (1)
We Ty 7%? +
BB
where
Ng = relative volatility of A compared with B,
y = vapor-phase mole fraction,
x = liquid-phase mole fraction.
To achieve good decontamination from the less volatile FP, the relative

volatility must be small. For systems in which the FP concentration is
small, the relative volatility can be approximated by

[04 ~3
AB yp %, J (2)
which is the Henry's law constant, Hy» used in the expression

Tp = Hx, . (3)

Thus, determination of the Henry's law constant or relative volatility
for each of the nonvolatile FP will be sufficient for determining the
size and operating conditions for the distillation step.

The importance of relative volatility in determining the operating
characteristics of a distillation system is shown by the following calcu-
lation. Consider a material balance of an FP in the proposed distillation
195

process. The amount of FP fed into the still per unit time ("xo ) must
equal the FP leaving the still per unit time (Dy), plus the rate of change
of FP in the still liquid a(vx)/at:

Fxg = Dy + a fd 5 (4)

 

where
x = mole fraction of FP in liquid,
Xp = inlet mole fraction of FP,
= mass feed rate in moles/unit time,
= vaporization rate in moles/unit time,
mass of liquid holdup in moles,

= mole fraction of FP in vapor,

a4 << oH
i

= time.

In the above material balance, vapor holdup is assumed to be negligible
compared with the liquid holdup.

Substituting Eq. (3) into the material balance gives, after rearrange-
ment,

a(x)

Solution of Eq. (5) with the boundary condition

 

+ DAX = Fxg . (5)

x =0att=20
and the condition that the liquid holdup V is constant yields

X = = (1 - "FOV

. (6)

Finally, the average vapor concentration at time t is given by the re-

lation
mse {1- [de ao TN] } (7)

Figure 7.2 shows the effect of relative volatility on the Traction
of FP retained in the liguid for different values of & as a function of
time for a feed rate of 14.1 £t° of salt per day and a liquid volume of
4 £43. For retention of 90% of the FP introduced to the system during
60 days of continuous distillation, a relative volatility of ~0.001 is
needed.

In order to establish the relative volatility of an FP in the MSBR
carrier salt, it is necessary to determine the concentration of the FP
in the vapor at equilibrium with a known liquid composition. At this
196

phase of development, exact operating conditions in the still have not
been set, but the following ranges appear reasonable: temperature, 900-
13100°C; maximum FP liquid concentration, 0.1-1.0 mole %s pressure, vapor
pressure of mixture. Since the MSBR carrier salt is a mixture of Ii and
Bel';, the exact composition of the carrier salt or solvent in the still
liguid will be dependent on operating temperature and pressure; however,
in the temperature range of interest, the major portion of the still
carrier salt will be the less volatile Ii¥F. Therefore, all experimental
tests were made with binary mixtures of LiF and FP fluoride. In later
tests, multicomponent systems will be used.

The FP contaminants of main concern are the rare earths. Of these,
the ones which will be present in the largest amount or which will present
the largest neutron losses are Nd, Sm, Pm, Pr, Eu, Ia, and Ce. These
fission products will probably be present as the trifluoride, with the
exception of cerium, which might be present partially as the tetravalent
fluoride.

The equipment used for determining relative volatilities was a simple
equilibrium still with a cold finger in the vapor phase. This still was
constructed from l1-in. nickel tubing Tor the liquid and disengagement
space, and 5/8-in. tubing for the vapor space through which a 3/8-in.
nickel cold finger was inserted (Fig. 7.3). The top of the vapor section
was connected to vacuum and inert gas. The entire assembly was placed in
a S5-in.-diam tube furnace. Thermocouples were inserted in the still
through thermowells in the liquid phase and at three points in the vapor
phase. During a test, the temperature measured at the three lower points
was maintained within 5°C of a predetermined value.

The cold finger could be cooled by alr, water, or a combination of
both. This was done by introducing the coolant through a center 1/8-in.-
diam tube and removing it through the annular space between the 1/8- and
3/8-in.-diam tubes. By using a coolant rate of 0.2 std liter of H,0 per
minute and 11.4 std liters of air per minute, the tip of the cold finger
could be cooled from the maximum still temperature (1075°C) to less than
the melting point of I4iF (847°C) within 2 sec. This rapid cooling would
prevent preferential condensation of the less volatile component during
the cold-finger operation.

The experimental procedure used was to first charge the still with
a known mixture of IiF-FP fluoride; then, after the still was filled with
an inert gas (purified helium or argon), it was brought to the desired
temperature. At this point the still was subjected to a vacuum pump with
the capability of reducing the pressures to less than 50 pu Hg. After the
temperature and pressure reached an apparent steady state, the cold finger
was cooled for 2 to 4 min for collection of a vapor sample. The inert gas
was again introduced, the cold finger was removed and replaced with a
clean one, and the procedure was repeated.

The solid accumulated on the cold Tinger was scraped off, and it
constituted the equilibrium vapor-phase sample. Approximately 0.01 g
wag collected for each sample, and two samples were collected at each
get of conditions. For each still liquid mixture, tests were made at
four temperatures, 925, 975, 1025, and 1075°C.

Experimental tests have been made on all the important rare-earth
fluorides with the exception of promethium. Results are given in Table
7.1. They are generally consistent and compare favorably with results
obtained by Kelly? in work described in the subsection “"Evaporative-
Distillation Studies on Molten-Salt Fuel Components" of this report.

Fuel Reconstitution

A necessary step in the processing of the MSBR fuel is the recombi-
nation of the purified uranium hexafluoride with the purified carrier
salt, which includes reduction of UFg, the product of the {luorination
step, to UF,. The usual method for reducing UFg to UF, uses excess
hydrogen in an Hp~F, flame which produces hydrogen flucride as a by-
product. The resulting UF, powder is collected at the base of a tall
reaction vessel. Although this operation has been reduced to routine
production, it appears undesirable for radiochemical application because
of the inherent solids handling problem. An alternative is the reduction
of UFg to UF, in a molten salt, involving only gases and liquids. When
UF; ig contacted with a molten fluoride salt containing UF,, it is absorbed
with reaction to form intermediate fluorides of uranium such as UFs. These
intermediate fluorides can then be reduced to UF, by contacting the salt
with hydrogen. Initial but definitive tests have shown this alternative
to be quite feasible. A tower which might serve well to conduct this
sequence of reactions is shown in Fig. 7.4.

Questions of feasibility are raised concerning the equilibrium
distribution of the various species of uranium fluorides and the rate
at which the reactions proceed. It is believed that the addition of Ulg
to a molten salt containing UF, results in the formation of dissolved
fluorides of uranium with a valence intermediate between 4+ and 6+. This
behavior is indicated by the fact that quantities of Fp; sufficient for
the formation of UFs can be absorbed by molten salt containing UF, with-
out the evolution of UFg. Similar behavior is also noted in reactions
between UF, and UFg in the absence of molten salt to yield intermediate
200

fluorides such as UiFi15. It could be expected that the homogeneous re~
action rate would be very rapid and that the absorption rate would probha-
bly depend upon diffusion to and from the interface. Previous data on
the reduction of uranium fluorides intermediate between UF, and UFg in
molten salts do not exist; however, rate data may be inferred from the
reduction of UF with hydrogen in molten mixtures of IiF and BeF, per-
formed by Long. He observed that the ratio of the concentrations of
hydrogen and HF in gas bubbles rising through the molten salt reached
equilibrium in only a few inches. His data also indicate only 1% re-
duction of UF, to UF; by a gas stream containing 1% HF in hydrogen at
pressures of 1 atm at 600°C.

The experimental equipment consisted of a reaction vessel in which
molten salt containing UF, could be contacted with a metered stream of
UFg, HF, Hy, or Np, and NaF traps to collect UFg and/or HF in the off-gas
(Fig. 7.5). Two NaF traps were provided downstream of the vessel; one

trap was used only for trapping UFg from the vessel off-gas during UFg
addition to the molten salt, and the other trap was used for all other
HF or UFg absorption. The reduction vessel was constructed from 4-in.-
diam sched-40 nickel pipe and was 26 in. long. A 3/8-in. nickel inlet
line was located in the center of the vessel and terminated 1/4 in. from
the bottom of the vessel. A 3/4-in. fitting on the top flange allowed
the insertion of a cold, 3/8-in. nickel rod, which was used for sampling
the salt. A 3/8-in. off-gas line was connected to the top flange. The
vessel was heated by two Nichrome~wire resistance furnaces.

Three experiments were carried out at 600°C in which UFg was intro-
duced at the rate of 1.5 g/min at a point 12 in. below the surface of a
molten IiF-ZrF, mixture containing ~0.5 mole % UF. The initial salt
charge consisted of 5320 g of Zr¥,, 863 g of LiF, and 61.8 g of UFy
(0.197 g~mole of UF,) and had a melting point of approximately 510°C.
Complete absorption of the UFg was observed during each of the tests,
which resulted in the absorption of a total of 147 g of UFg during a
period of 98 min.

During a typical run, the salt charge from the previous run was
heated to 600°C and sparged with Np for 15 min at the rate of 100 cm?/min
(8TP), after which a salt sample was taken. The salt was then sparged
with HF at the rate of 0.5 1b/hr for 1 hr and with Ny for 15 min, after
which a second salt sample was taken. Uranium hexafluoride was then
bubbled into the salt at a rate of 1.5 g/min for a specified length of
time, with the vessel off-gas passing through an Nal bed used exclusively
during this period. The salt was then sparged with Np for 15 min and
sampled. The salt was then sparged with Hp at the rate of 95 cm? /min
(STP) for 30 min and sampled, after which the Hp sparge was continued for
an additional 30 min.

Two questions related to the experimental work are of primary in-
terest. These are (1) the fraction of URg which was absorbed by the
molten salt and (2) the valence of the uranium in the resulting mixture.
It was concluded that, within the accuracy of the experimental data,
complete absorption of the UFg by the molten salt had occurred. No
uranium was found on the Nal" trap used during the UFyg addition period.
The concentration of Ug in the salt sample taken after UF; addition was
below the limit of detection of 0.05 wt 4. Reduction of the uranium to
UF, probably occurred during the addition of UFg by the reaction of the
intermediate fluorides with nickel from the vessel wall.

From these tests it appears that UFg could be rapidly absorbed by
molten fluoride salt containing about 1 wt % UF, at 600°C and that the
intermediate fluoride formed could be reduced with hydrogen to UF,. Sub-
sequent studies are recommended to provide more quantitative data for
engineering design; however, this form of recombination of UFg with the
purified carrier salt will be indicated on all subsequent flowsheets.
202

Continuous Fluorination of a Molten Salt

 

Since the presence of uranium in the distillation step to separate
the carrier salt from the fission products would cause unnecessary compli-
cations, it is removed continuously in a prior fluorination step. Pre-
vious experience with the removal of uranium from molten salt by fluori-
nation includes the operation of the Molten-~Salt Fluoride Volatility
Pilot Plant at ORNL.* In this facility, batch fluorinations completely
volatilized the uranium as UFg, which allowed its subsequent purification
and recovery by absorption and cold trapping. Observed corrosion in this
facility was severe but acceptable in a batch process of this sort. How-
ever, it would be intolerable in a continuous unit, or in any unit with
enough capacity to handle the processing stream for an MSBR. A possible
solution to the corrosion problem is the operation of the fluorination

essel, presently envisioned as a tower, with a layer of frozen salt on
the vessel wall. Experience with this type of system was obtained with
batch Tluorinations made at Argonne National Laboratory” in support of
the molten-salt fluoride volatility process. Successful tests were also
made at ORNL using ohmic heating to provide the internal heat generation,
where it was found that a gas flow could be maintained through an unheated
line which entered the Tluorinator vessel at a point velow the molten-
salt surface when a frozen salt layer was present on the fluorinator
wall. In application to the MSBR fluorinator, internal heat generation
will be provided by the fission product decay heat.

Experimental studies of continuous fluorination of molten sali are
being made in a l-in.~-diam nickel column with a salt depth of 48 in. No
provision is being made in the present experimental work for corrosion
protection by a frozen layer of salt (Fig. 7.56). Hluorination tests in
which 15 cm’/min of molten salt (NaF-LiF-ZrF,) containing 0.5 wt % UFg
was contacted countercurrently with 70 cm? [min of F, (STP) at 600°C
showed removal of uranium from the salt at 96 to 99.4% efficiency during
a l1-hr period of continuous operation. Material balances were compli-
cated by the inevitable corrosion of the nickel vessel. Complete removal
of uranium from the salt with no corrosion would yield, for the above con-
ditions, a UFg concentration of 17.6 mole % in the off-gas. Observed con-
centrations ranged as high as 35 mole % UF.

These results indicate that subsequent development can be expected
to produce acceptable recoveries of uranium by continuous fluorination.

Chromivm Fluoride Trapping

 

At the conclusion of tests on the MIRE, uranium will be recovered
from the fuel salt as Uf'gy by sparging the salt with F,. Fluorides of
chromium will be present in the fuel salt as a result of corrosion of
reactor piping and of equipment used for bydrofluorination or fluorination
of the salt. A potential problem associated with the recovery of the
uranium is the presence of volatile fluorides of chromium (CrF, and CrFs)

in the fluorinator off-gas; these fluorides cannot only contaminate the
UF product but also render equipment inoperative by deposition in lines,
valves, etc. A study has been completed which will permit the design of
a trapping system for removing these fluorides from the off-gas, which
will also contain UFg and Fs.

Experiments were carried out in which 1 liter/min of Fp (STP) was
sparged through a molten NaF-1iF-ZrF, mixture at 650°C which contained
0.5 to 4 wt % Cri. The resulting off-gas containing fluorine and vola-
tile fluorides of chromium then passed through beds of pelleted Nal at
400°C for removal of chromium fluorides. In some tests, a Ufg flow of
100 em?/min was added to the Fj.

It can be concluded that (1) fixed beds of NaF at 400°C are effective
in removing fluorides of chromium from a gas stream which also contains
UFg and Fo; (2) pelleted NaF having a surface area of 0.074 m?/g and a
void fraction of 0.277 is superior to material having a surface area of
1 m?/g and a void Traction of 0.45, and has an effective capacity of about
20 g of chromium per 100 g of NaF; (3) uranium losses to the 400°C NaF
bed of less than 0.01% are achievable when working with a gas stream that
contains 0.4 mole of CrFs per mole of UFg in Fp.

Design and Evaluation Study

 

A preliminary design study has been made of a conceptual processing
plant to treat irradiated fuel and fertile streams from the 1000-Mw
(electrical) MSBR described in the section "Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor
204

Design Studies" of this report. The study evaluated the engineering
feasibility and costs Tor a plant that operated continuously as an inte-
gral part of the reactor system, being located in two cells adjacent to
the reactor cell. The plant was designed to treat 15 ft°/day of fuel
salt and 105 £t°/day of fertile salt. The fuel salt was an LiF-BeF,
(69-31 mole %) mixture containing the fissionable 233UF, ; ertile salt
was a 71-29 mole % mixture of IiF~ThF,. The lithium component of each
stream was enriched to about 99.995 at. % “Ii. The processing cycle was
selected to give the optimum combination of fuel cycle cost and breeding
gain.

Description of Fuel Process

 

The primary objective of the fuel process is to recover uranium and
carrier salts sufficiently decontaminated from fission and corrosion
products so that the reactor has an attractive breeding potential. The
recovered materials are recycled to the reactor, and the fission products
are discarded. Only four major operations are required to accomplish
this for the fuel stream: flucrination, sorption of UFg, vacuum distil-
lation, and salt reconstitution. These operations are shown schematically
in Fig. 7.1.

As it enters the processing cell, fuel salt is only a Tew seconds
removed from the fission zone and is extremely radioactive. The stream
is delayed for about 36 hr before fluorination to allow the heat genera-
tion rate to decrease to a point that temperature control in the fluori-
nator 1s made casier. The curve in Fig. 7.7 shows the gross heat gener-
ation rate of the fuel salt. The molten salt flows into the top of a
column and is contacted by a countercurrent stream of fluorine, which
strips out the uranium according to the reaction

500-550°C
ur, + Fg ———————> Ul'g

Fission products Ru, Tc, Nb, Cs, Mo, and Te are also volatilized and ac-
company the Ukg.

The system, consisting of molten LiF-BeF,-UF,, fission products, and
elemental fluorine, is extremely corrosive to the walls of the fluorinator,
requiring clever design if a significant lifetime is to be obtained. It
is proposed to Jacket the fluorinator with a coolant that will maintain
a 0.5- to 0.75-in.-thick layer of frozen salt on the inner surface of the
column to shield the wall from the molten salt.” A schematic diagram of
the fluorinator is shown in Fig. 7.8.

The gas stream leaving the fluorinator passes through a sorption
system composed of temperature-controlled beds of NaF and MgF, pellets.
The first section of the NaF bed is held at about 400°C and sorbs most
of the fission products; the second section of the bed at about 100°C

sorbs technetium, part of the molybdenum, and UFg, and allows the re~
maining fission products to pass. Upon heating from 100 to 400°C, the
second section of the sorber releases molybdenum, technetium, and UFg,
which passes through MgF, for retention of technetium while allowing UFg
to pass. Uranium hexafluoride is frozen in cold traps and retained for
recycle to the reactor.

Uraniunm-free salt flows from the fluorinator into a continuous
distillation unit, which is operated at about 1 mm Hg pressure and 1000°C.
Under these conditions, it 1s possible to distill LiF and BeF, from the
bulk of the fission products.® Rare-earth fission products are much less
volatile than lithium or beryllium fluoride, allowing a good separation
to be achieved. Zirconium fluoride, however, is sufficiently volatile
that this fission product will contaminate the LiF-BeF, product.

In this study the vacuum still was a 2.5-ft-diam by 4-ft-high vessel
containing a bank of cooling tubes over most of its height. A condensing
surface at the top condensed and collected the overhead product. To
initiate the operation the interior of the still is charged with 4 +t? of
molten LiF; the still is evacuated and brought to temperature, and salt
from the fluorinator is allowed to flow into the pool of molten Lif.
Temperature 1s controlled so that liquid is vaporized at the same rate at
which it enters the still. There is no bottom discharge, so the still
volume remains constant. Accordingly, the concentration of fission

products steadily increases in the 4 ft? of LiF. After about 67 days’
operation the accumulated heat generation rate (see Fig. 7.9) has become
so great that the heat removal capability of the cooling system is
reached; the still contents are then drained to waste storage, and the
operation is repeated. Heat 1s removed by forced circulation of Nak on
the shell side of the tubes.

The concentration factor for rare-earth fission products in the
gtill is about 250. The fraction of the process stream, which 1s almost
entirely 714i, discarded at this point is slightly less than 0.4%. Be-
cause of the volatility of Zrf,, an additional discard of the distillate
is required to purge this fission product. As much as a 5% throwaway
might be necessary in this type of operation. At the time of this ztudy,
data were not available to assess the effect of increasing fission
product concentration in the still on relative volatilities. Conse~
quently, the overall decontamination factor (DF) of the distillate cannot
be predicted accurately, but it is believed that a DF of at least 100 can
ve attained.

The final step in fuel processing is reconstitution to make a
suitable feed for the reactor. The LiF-Bels,; distillate is admitted to
a reduction column containing molten (~600°C) IiF-BeF,-UF, that is
approximately the correct fuel composition. Concurrently, gaseous UFg
from the cold traps is introduced near the bottom of the column, and
hydrogen gas is admitted at a point a little farther up the column. The
UFe absorbs in the molten salt to form an intermediate fluoride of
nranium such as UFs, which reacts with Hp according to the reaction

UF's +S Hy ur, + HF .

Makeup UFg from the blanket process and makeup IiF and BeF,; are added at

this point. The reconstituted fuel is sent to the reactor core to com-
plete the fuel processing cycle.

Description of Fertile Process

 

The fertile stream process consists only of continuous fluorination
and UFg purification by sorption. The operation is analogous Lo the
corresponding fuel stream operation but at a higher volumetric rate. The
cycle time of the fertile stream is purposely kept short (20 to 25 days)
to keep a low uranium concentration in the blanket, thereby keeping the
fission rate low. The low fission rate ensures a low fission product
accumulation rate so that it is unnecessary to remove them on the same
cycle as uranium. In fact, a 30-year discard cycle of the barren fertile
stream is a sufficient purge rate for fission products.

Excess UFg over that required to refuel the core is sold.

Waste Treatment

Four waste streams requiring storage leave the processing facility:
(1) aqueous waste from the KOH scrubber, (2) NaF and MgF, sorbent from
the UFg purification system, (3) molten-salt residue from the distillation
unit, and (4) molten salt from the fertile-stream discard. The aqueous
waste comes from vent-gas scrubbing and is small in volume; 1t was as-
sumed that this stream could be combined with reactor aqueous wastes for
storage. The two molten-sallt wastes are stored in underground tanks, and
the pelletized sorbents are stored in cylindrical containers in an under-
ground vault. Forced draft cooling is provided for these three storage
areas.

This study includes a charge for 30-year interim storage of the
molten-salt wastes and for 5-year interim storage of the solid waste.
Perpetual storage beyond these times was not considered.
209
Off-Gags Treatment

Most of the off-gas from the process comes from the continuous
fluorinators. Although fluorine is recycled, a small amount is bled
of f to purge gaseous fission products. The off-gas is scrubbed with
an aqueous caustic solution, filtered, and discharged to the atmosphere.

Summary of Capital and Operating Costs

 

The design study included an estimation of capital and operating
cests for the integrated processing plant. Space requirements and costs
were estimated for a typical layout (Fig. 7.10) adjacent to the reactor
system. Fach item of major eguipment was designed to the extent that a
reasonably accurate estimate of its cost could be made; the costs of
auxiliary items, such as utilities, plping, instrumentation, electrical
connections, insulation, and sampling, were estimated by applying appro-
priate factors to process equipment costs.

Direct operating costs were estimated for labor and supervision,
consumed chemicals, utilities, and maintenance materials. These costs

and capital costs are summarized in Table 7.2.
