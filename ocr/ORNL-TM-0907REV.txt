(1) Experience during Hao-HF treatment of flush salt in April
1965. (Ref. 1) : -
(2) Use of fuel salt containing 230 kg of 33% enriched uranium
| instead of 60 kg of 93% enriched uranium.
(3) The decision to process fuel salt after 30 days instead of |
~ 90 days ‘decay. : | :

2.1 Hp-HF Treatment for Oxide Removal

EY

Moisture or oxygen inleakage into the reactor salt system or use of

helium cover gas containing moisture or oxygen could cause oxide accumu-

Yation in the salt and, eventually, precipitation of ‘solids. In the flush.
or coolant salts, the. precipitated, solid would be BeO, which has a solu-

bility of approximately 290 ppm at 1200°F (see Fig. 2.1): Zirconium -

tetrafluoride was added to the fuel salt as an oxygen getter to prevent
small amounts of oxygen from causing uranium precipitation: Ir the flush
salt 1s contaminated with fuel salt up to approximately 0.01 mole of zir-.
conium per kg of salt (~ 1% fuel in flush salt), there would be insuf-
ficient zirconium present to exceed the solubility of ZrOz at 1112°F,
and any precipitate would be BeO. Above this zirconium concentration,
exceeding the solubility 1imit would cause ZrOg precipitation. When
sufficient ZrO has precipitated to reduce the Zr:U ratio to ~ 5, co-
precipitation of ZrOz and UOz will occur. The effect of 3% contamination
of the flush salt with fuel salt is shown in Fig. 2.1.

‘Oxides will be removed by treating the fuel or flush salt in the
fuel storage tank. (see Fig. 2. 2) with a mixture of Hz and HF gas. In

the treatment process, HF will’ react with the oxide to form the fluoride

and water, the water will be evolved along with the hydrogen and excess
HF, The Hp will prevent excessive corrosion of the INOR-8 structural
material by maintaining a reducing condition in, the salt, The gases will

: pass through. an NaF bed for decontamination before monitoring for water

determination. The gas stream will then ‘pass through a caustic scrubber

. for neutralization of the HF. The hydrogen will go to the offgas system.

The treatment willbe terminated when water is no longer detected in the

~offgas stream. A final sparging with helium will remove [dissolved HF.

2.1. 2 Hiydrofluorination

. Hydrogen fluoride will: be. obtained in 100-1b cylinders. One cylinder

3

will provide sufficient HF for. 92 hr of processing at a flow rate of

9 liters /min (Hz: HF = 10: 1). “The HF cylinder will be partially submerged

in a water bath heated with low-pressure steam to provide sufficient -

pressure for the required flow rate. Since heating of the cylinders

above 125°F is not recommended, ‘there is a pressure py on. the' exit

gas set at 22 psig. ~The HF gas. will pass through an electric heater to

‘raise the temperature: above 180°F and reduce the molecular weight to 20

for accurate flow metering, The hydrogen flow will be started before the
HF flow to minimize corrosion. The hydrogen flow rate will be set at

the rotameter at the gas ‘supply station west of the building. The hydro--

gen fluoride flow rate will be regulated by the controller on the \

* panelboard in the high-bay area. The salt backup prevention valve must

be closed with the manual switch until flow is started, at which time the
differential pressure’ switch will maintain ‘the valve in the closed. po-

sition unless the tank pressure exceeds the Ho-HF pressure.

The offgas stream leaving the fuel storage tank will consist of hy-
drogen, water, excess hydrogen fluoride, and helium, - Volatilization of
fission and corrosion products is expected to be much lower than during
fluorination because of the reducing effect of the hydrogen. Fission

- products that are partially volatilized as fluorides during fluorination,

such as ruthenium, nicbiun, and antimony, are expected to exist in the
metallic state, Any chromium in the salt from corrosion is expected to
be in the nonvolatile +2 or +3 valence state. The offgas stream will
pass through a heated line to the NaF trap. The line will be heated to ~

: 200°F to prevent condensation of H0-HF.

The salt temperature is not critical during Ho-HF treatment since -
corrosion and fission product volatilization are not important. For.
rapid oxide removal it is necessary that all the oxide is in solution.
The salt temperature should be sdjusted ebout 50°F higher ‘than that indi-

| cated by the oxide analysis and solubility curves. The temperature

should not be maintained higher than necessary since this lowers the HF

solubility and consequently the HF utilization.

The hydrogen fluoride and Hz flow will be stopped when no more water
is detected in the offgas stream. The salt will then be sparged with
helium to remove dissolved HF and ‘to purge the system of HF and hydrogen.

"The gas stream will be checked for hydrogen before 1t enters the offgas
duet by passing a small stream through a hyarogen monitor.

2.1. 3 NaF Trapping

A remotely removable NoF bed is provided in the fuel- ~processing

cell to remove small amounts: of volatilized fission or corrosion products

from the offgas stream. The trap Sill be maintained at 50°F to prevent

- adsorption of HF. Since the. vapor pressure of HF over NaF is 1 atm at
532°F, the trap could. be operated at a somewhat lover temperature,’ but
T50°F will be required’ +o prevent UFe adsorption during fluorination (see
Sect. 2.2.3), and this temperature was selected for both operations.
 

 

"2.1.4 Monitoring for Water

The removel of oxides from ‘the selt will be followed by passing a
2 ce/min side stream of the gas stream from the NaF trap through a
water monitor (See Fig. 2.3). This monitor consists ‘of an NaF trap for
removal of HF from the sample stream before it is passed through an
electrolytic hygrometer. The part of the monitor through which the
radioactive sample passes is located in the sbsorber cubicle for contain--
ment. Integration. of the monitor readings indicates the total amount of

4

oxide removed. |

A more elaborate but less accurate method of determining. the oxide
removal by cold-trapping, was installed before the water monitor was de-
"veloped. Since the monitor performed very ‘well during the flush salt
processing, the cold trap serves only as a backup for the monitor and a
qualitative check on the end point. As originally conceived, several : =
runs would have been required under steady operating conditions to ob-
tain data for correlation of cold trap volume with oxide content. Be--
cause of the excellent performance of the monitor these runs have not : ”
‘been made. However, the absence of water in the gas stream will be seen :
in the cold trap system by the termination of condensation and reduced
heat load on the trap.

2.1.5 Offgas Handling

The hydrogen fluoride will be neutralized in a static caustic
scrubber tank. + Hydrogen and helium from the scrubber will pass ‘through
an activated-charcoal trap and a flame arrester before entering the cell
ventilation duct. The cell ventilation air will pass through an absolute
filter, located in the spare cell, before going to the main filters and
stack. As mentioned before, little activity is expected in the offgas
stream during Hp-HF treatment. ) )
Since the fluorine disposal system will not be used during Ho-HF
treatment but will still be connected to the scrubber inlet line, the
system must be purged to prevent diffusion and condensation of Ho0-HF in
the disposal system. This will be done by connecting Nz cylinders at
the S02 cylinder manifold. As an additional precaution, the SOz preheater OU :

should be heated, because the stainless steel preheater would be es-
pecially subject to corrosion by the wet HF.

.2.1.6 Liquid Waste Disposal

The caustic scrubber will be charged with 1300 1 liters of 2 M KOH

: prepared by dilution of a 459 KOH ‘solution. Three 115-gal. batches of

2 M (10%) KOH will be prepared in & portsble mix tank in the high-bay
‘area and charged through a line provided with a manual valve and a check
valve. Dilution to 2 M will be. required because of the. possibility of
gel formation in KF solutions of greater than 2 M. :

At 9.1-liters/min HF flow, the KOH will have to be replaced every
b. days when the final concentration is 0.35 M. It will, therefore, be
necessary +o Jet the KOH solution to the liguid waste tank and replace
it with fresh ‘caustic when a 100- -1b HF cylinder has been consumed.

2.2 Uranium Recovery

2.2. 1  Sumery

The fuel or £1ush salt should be allowed to decay as long as possible
before fluorination to minimize the discharge of the volatile fission-
product fluorides that will be formed by the oxidizing action of the
fluorine. The most important volatile activities are iodine, tellurium,
niobium, ruthenium, and antimony. However, salt samples during reactor
* operation have shown only iodine remaining in the salt in large concen-

- trations.

After decay, the salt batch. will be fluorinated. in the fuel storage
tank. The offgas containing UFe, excess fluorine, and volatile activity
will pass through a high-temperature NaF trap for decontamination and
chromium removal before absorption on low-temperature NaF absorbers.
Excess fluorine will be reacted with SOz to prevent damage to the Fiber-
glas filters. Before filtration the offgas will be further decontemi-
‘nated by passage through an activated charcoal bed.

The absorbers will be transported to another facility where they will
be desorbed and ‘the UFg cold trapped and collected in product cylinders.

2.2. 2 Fluorination:

" Uranium will be recovered from ‘the molten salt. by sparging with

fluorine to convert the UE, to volatile UFs. The fluorine will be diluted

with ean equal volume of helium when fluorine is detected in the offgas
stream to reduce the number of times the fluorine trailer must be changed.
This should have little effect on the overall processing time, since. |
utilization is expected to be low after most of the uranium has been

voletilized., A total gas flow of about 50 liters/min should provide good

egitation, The salt sample line will be purged with helium -Guring
fluorination to prevent UFe diffusion and will be heated to prevent
condensation. The temperature of the melt will be maintained as low as

practical (~ 30 to 50°F above the liquidus of 813°F) to keep corrosion

and fission-product volatilization to a minimum, Boiling points of some

volatile fluorides are listed in Teble 2.2. The heaters on the upper
half and top of ‘the tank will not be used during fluorination to reduce
salt entraimment but they will be turned on after fluorination to melt

down splatter and condensation,

There will be an initial induction period before evolution of UF
begins. The extent of this period will depend on the amount of uranium
in the salt and the degree of agitation of the salt. A minimum of
0.5 mole of fluorine per mole of uranium will be required to convert ell : 5
the UF to UFs. After this, UFg will begin to form and be evolved. At
50 liters/min of fluorine, UFg evolution can begin about 2 hr after the
start of fluorination. Since the vapor space between the salt and the
first absorber is ~ 1300 liters, another 15 min will provetly be re-
quired before absorption begins,

Volatility Pilot Plant date show that essentially no fluorine is
evolved until at least 1 mole of fluorine per mole of uranium has been
added or the system has operated 6 hr at 50 liters/min. However, until
more. 1s known sbout the sparging efficiency and the effect of the fuel
storage tank geometry and selt compo&ition, the fluorine disposal system
will be put in operation at the stert of fluorine flow with sufficient
S02 to react with 50 liters of fluorine per minute. a.

Evolution of UFg will be followed by means of the absorber tempera- ,
tures. Fluorine breakthrough should be detectable by temperature rise in
the fluorine reactor. When fluorine breakthrough is detected, the fluorine
flow will be reduced to one-half and an equal flow of helium will be
started. This will maintain the necessary degree of mixing while pro-
viding sufficient fluorine to prevent the back reaction

oh

2 UFg —» 2 UFs + Fo.

Corrosion can consume as much as 3 liters of fluorine per minute
(0.2 mil/hr).

With the 354-enriched uranium fuel salt, it will be necessary to
replace the absorbers three times. Before this can be done, the salt
must be sparged with helium to remove dissolved UFg and fluorine and to
purge the gas space of UFg. After sparging before absorber changes and
‘at the end of fluorination, the salt will be sampled to check on the

o

uranium removal.
It will be necessary to replace the fluorine trailer every 3- 1/2 hr
at a fluorine flow rate of 50 liters/min or every T hr with one-half flow. <

There is” sufficient ‘space at the gas supply station to have only one
trailer connected at a time, Additional trailers will be at the site,
however, so’ downtime should not be. long. .

Corrosion will be ‘much more severe under the strongly oxidizing con-

ditions of fluorination than during ‘the Ho-HF treatment. A corrosion’

rate of 0.5 mil/hr vas experienced in the Volatility Pilot Plant in a

nickel vessel, Fluorination of the high-uranium-content salt (fuel salt C) .
may take as long as 50 hr, but recovery of small amounts of uranium from

the flush salt should require much less time, A .50- hr fluorination would’

~ cause an average corrosion of approximately 3% of the fuel storage tank
‘wall at 0.2 mil/hr. Corrosion of the fuel storage tank may be less than

in the VPP because of the. smaller surface-to-volume ratio, the use of
dilute fluorine, and the lower fluorination temperature; also corrosion

tests indicate that TNOR-8 may be more corrosion resistant ‘than nickel,

2.2.3 NaF Trapping

The NaF bed will be important airing fluorination for uranium re-
covery because of the greater volatilization of fission and corrosion

. products than during oxide removal. The bed will egain be maintained at

T50°F, which is above the decomposition temperature of the UFg+2NaF
complex (T02°F at 1000 mm). Any volatilized PuFe will sbsorb on the NaF
and. provide separation from the ‘uranium. Sodium fluoride at T50°F will

‘remove essentially all of the niobium and ruthenium from the fluorinator

offgas stream, and these will be the principal activities that could cause

product contemination. More iodine will volatize but will not absorb on
hot or. cold NeF. | Essentially all the chromium fluoride will be absorbed.
Chromium is troublesome not only ‘because of the gamms activity of the
-Slor formed by neutron activation ‘but also because of the inactive
chromium that ‘will collect in valves and. emall lines and cause plugging .
‘and seat leakage. ALL ‘piping to and from the NaF bed must. be heated to
~ above 200°F to prevent UF condensation. Teble 2.3 shows the expected |
“behavior of the volatile fluorides on NaF. Ll

2.2.4 UFg Absorption
The decontaminated UFg gas from the T50°F NaF bed will flow to five

NaF absorbers in series, which are located in a sealed cubicle in the
high-bay area. These absorbers will be cooled with air, as required, to
‘prevent uranium loss. At 300°F the vapor pressure of UFg over the’
UFg+2NaF complex will be 0.1 mm, and uranium losses will be significant
“(2.4 g of U per hour with a flow of 50 liters/min). The capacity of NaF
for UFg varies inversely with the temperature, since the more rapid re-
action at higher temperatures inhibits penetration of the UFg by sealing
off the external pores with UFg+2NaF.2 .To obtain maximum cepacity the
cooling air should therefore be turned on as soon as a temperature rise
is indicated. The absorber temperatures should not exceed 250°F. Also,
with low fluorine concentration at elevated temperatures there could be

a reduction of UFg-2NaF to UFs-2NaF, which would remain with the NaF when
the UFg was desorbed from the NaF. The loading of the absorbers can be |

followed by bed temperatures, and the air can be adjusted as required.
The air will be discharged to the cell by a small blower in the cell.

oy portable alpha activity monitor will be used to detect leaks of
UFs in the cubicle, In the event of a leak in the absorber cubicle, the -
fluorine flow would be stopped and the cubicle would be purged with air-
and opened for repairs. The location of the leak should be detectable

"either visually or with an alpha probe.

When fluorination has been completed, the absorbers will be discon-
nected and sent to another facility for desorption end cold trapping of
the UFg. It will be necessary to stop fluorination when the absorbers

‘are loaded and replace the absorbers as noted above, This: will require

a complete purging of the system to remove all UFe from the connecting
piping. | |
2. 2.5 Excess Fluorine Disposal

Since an average efficiency of less than 25% is expected during
fluorination, there will be a large excess of fluorine. - If this fluorine
were allowed to flow through ‘the offgas filters, damage to the Fiberglas
might result with release of any accumulated activity. To prevent this,
the excess fluorine will be reacted with an excess of S02. Both the 502

‘and the Fo will be preheated: electrically to 300 to 4OO°F and then fed
‘into e Monel reactor wrapped with steam coils. The steam will serve the
dual purpose of keeping ‘the reactor warm to initiate the reaction and of

cooling the reactor after the reaction is started. The reaction is

strongly exothermic end proceeds smoothly at LOO°F. The product is

S02F2, a relatively inert gas. An activated alumina trap is installed
downstream of the Fa reactor for 8 backup of the 802 system. This trap
will dispose of any unreacted. fluorine resulting from insufficient S02
or - other malfunction in the S02 system.

2. 2. 6 Offgas Hendling

~ The fluorination oftgas stream from the activated alumine trap. vill
tet pass through the empty caustic scrubber tenk. The scrubber tank

‘offgas will pass through the" activated-charcoal traps ‘for additional

fission-product removal before entering the cell ventilation duct just
upstreem of the absolute filter in the spare cell. The cell air will then
go to the main ‘filters and be discharged from the 100-ft contaiment stack.

3. EQUIEMENT DESCRIPTION

3.1 Plant Layout

The main portion of the fuel-handling and -processing system is in »
the fuel-processing cell, immediately north of the drain tank cell in
Building T7503, as shown in Figures 3.1 and 3.2. The gas supply station
is outside the building, west of the drain tank cell. The offgas filter,
hydrogen flame arrester, activated-charcoal trap, and waste salt removal
line are in the spare cell east of the fuel-processing cell. The system
will be operated from the high-bay area over the cell, where a smell instru-
ment panelboard is located. Also in the high-bay ares are the salt-
charging ares, the UFe absorber cubicle, the salt sampler for the fuel
storage tank, end an instrument cubicle. The instrument cubicle contains
~ the instrument transmitters and. check and block valves connected directly
to process equipment, and it is sealed and monitored. Figures 3.3 end
3.14 are photographs of the fuel-processing cell and the operating area,

respectively.

3.2 Maintenance

‘Since corrosion is expected to be very low during Ha-HF treatment -
and only four fluorinations are planned, maintenance problems are not ex-
pected to be severe. The system, with a few exceptions, has therefore
been designed for direct maintenance, with savings in cost and complexity
of equipment. The exceptions are the NaF trap, activated alumina trap,

. salt filter, and two air- -operated valves. The NaF trap mey become
plugged by volatilized chromium: fluoride during Fluorination. In this
case it would be moved to one side and a new trap installed. It is
therefore flanged into the system and has disconnects for thermocouples
and electrical power. The alumina trap and salt filter is also flanged
for replacement, The valves have flanges with vertical bolts and dis-
connects for the air lines. The valves, filter and traps are located

* under roof plugs sized to pass through the portable maintenance shield.
This shield can also be used for viewing and for ‘external decontamination ’
© of equipment should this be required because of a leak. All heaters in : -
the cell have duplicate spares installed.

If e serious piping or equipment leak occurs before processing has
been completed, or if ‘€ntrance into the cell-is required for other

»

reasons after irradiated fuel has been processed, aqueous decontamination
‘may be required. The recommended method is described in Report ORNL-2550
- (Ref. 3) and consists of (1) barren salt flushes to displace as much as
possible of the irradiated salt, (2) aqueous ammonium oxalate flushes to
remove the salt film, (3) nitric acid-sluminum nitrate flushes-.to remove
metallic scale from the surfaces, and (4) sodium ‘hydroxide-hydrogen
peroxide- -sodium tartrate flushes for gas line ‘decontamination.

3.3.1 Fuel Storage Tank |
The fuel storage ‘tank in which chemical processing will take place is
similar to the reactor drain tanks. - The tank is shown in Figure 3.5,
° and design data are. given in Table 3, 1.
The height of the storage tank was increased by 30 in. over the

V height of the drain and flush tenks to minimize salt carryover due to
sparging during chemical processing. About 384 freeboard is provided -

The tank is heated by four sets of heaters. in the bottom, the lover
half, “the upper half, ‘and the top of the tank, Each set of heaters is
controlled separately’ with powerstats. Every heater has a duplicate in-

“stalled spare with leads outside the cell. The heaters are mounted on a
frame that is supported from the floor to minimize the “Save weight on the .

The tank has two dip “tubes, one for ges sparging and the other for
charging and discharging salt. The sparge line is a 1-in. pipe that is

‘closed at the bottom and has four 1/2-in. holes 90° apart near the ‘bottom.

. ~ The salt dip tube lies on the bottom of the tank at the center to mini-.
mize holdup (approximately 0. i of a full batch). Liquid level is deter-
mined by weighing the tank with two pneumatic weigh cells, The weigh

The gas enters on the outside of an internal cylindrical baffle and
leaves inside the baffle, end this the gas path is almost 2 ft.for a
12-in, depth of pellets. Gas velocities are kept below L ft/min to pre-
vent carryover of fines containing absorbed fission-product fluorides.
The trap has thermawells at the inlet, center, and exit, Heat is

controlled by separate variacs for the center and the outside of the bed.

Spare heaters are installed.

Since there is a possibility of plugging of this “trap with chromium
- during fluorination, it is designed for remote replacement. The inlet
and exit lines are provided with ring- joint flanges at the trap and some
distance away to permit removal of sections of the lines for access to
the trap. Thermocouple and electrical disconnects are ‘provided on ‘the

trap, and a standard. lifting bail is mounted on a strap: over the trap.

Heat generation in the NaF trap at the end of fluorination could be

as high as 4000 Btu/hr if all the °SNb after 30-d decay remains in the
salt during reactor operation and collects in the trap during processing.
Of this heat, 1100 -Btu/hr will be removed by the process gas stream and
, ~ 2000 Btu /hr through the insulation with the heaters off.. To remove the
remaining 900 Btu/hr and ensure that the exit half of the bed (internal
anmilus) does not exceed 800°F, air cooling is provided in the center
pipe. A heat transfer coefficient of 1 Btu/hr-ft2:°F will remove ~
"1000 Btu/hr with 8 cfm of air.
The trap will be by-passed if aqueous decontamination is necessary

to permit direct maintenance on cell components. In this case the trap
will be replaced with a Jumper line to permit flow of solutions through

\

‘the entire system.

3.3.3 Cold Trap

The extent of “oxide removal from the salt during Hz-HF treatment will

be deternined by cold trapping the offgas stream and measuring the volume
of water and HF condensed. The cold.trap is shown in Figure 3.7, and
design data are given in Table 3.3. The inlet end of the trep is in the
northwest corner of the cell and the trap extends eastward with a 3° |
slope. The inlet and outlet brine connections are reducing tees at each,
end of the jacket. oo

The condensate from the cold trap collects in a pot that auto-
matically siphons when full, The pot is shown in Fig. 3.7, and design
data are given in Table 3.3. The exit gas passes over a thermovell for
accurate determination of the offgas temperature. The pot 1s cooled
- by the brine before the brine enters the cold-trap jacket. The siphon
tube has a surface thermocouple outside of the thermal insulation to de-
tect each siphoning. |

3.3.5 Caustic Scrubber

The caustic scrubber is shown in Fig. 3. 8, and design data are given

in Table 3.4. The tank is provided with coils enclosed in a heat- transfer
medium. During Ho-HF treatment, cooling water will be circulated through
the coils to remove the heat: of HF neutralization. "During fluorination,
the tank will be drained. ’

The tenk is provided with a thermowell, a.liguid-level bubbler tube,
and a jet suction line. The used csustic is jetted to the liquid-vaste
tank when the molarity has been reduced from 2.0 to.approximately

0.3 M KOH. A caustic charging line is provided from the high-bay sres,.

The offgas from the scrubber tank 1s routed to the spare cell where
it passes through an.activated-charcoal trap and a flame arrester before
discharge into the cell ventilation duct. The gas should be free of air
or oxygen up to this point, since all purges are made with helium. A

sensitive pressure indicator will show any restriction in the offgas line

or flame srrested.
3.3.6 NaF Absorbers

The absorbers for collecting UFe on NaF pellets are made of carbon
steel, which is sufficiently resistant to fluorine for" the short exposures
involved. The absorbers will be used for processing only one batch and
will then be discarded to the burial ground. The absorbers are shown in
Fig. 3.9 and design data are given in Table 3.5. A bed depth of 10 in.
(24 kg of NaF) will be used.

Each absorber is mounted in an open top container with an air dis-
tributor pipe in the bottom. Cooling air flows around the outside and up
~ through the open 2-in. center pipe. Air can be controlled separately to

each sbsorber.

Each absorber is provided with a thermowell immersed in the NaF
pellets near the gas inlet. Since absorption of UFs to form UFg-2NaF
liberates 23.9 kcal per mole, the start of UFg absorption and the break-
through to the succeeding absorber in the train can be followed by ob-
serving the temperature rise.
The absorbers are connected with Jumper lines having ring- joint
flanges with pigtails for local leak detection before sealing the cubicle.
The lines in the cubicle all have tubular heaters to prevent UFs conden-
sation. No spares are installed because the cubicle 1s accessible to the.

high-bay area when processing is stopped.
3.3.7 Fluorine Disposal System

The excess fluorine is disposed of by reacting it with 802 to form
S02F2, which is a relatively inert gas and can be ‘safely passed through
the Fiberglas filters in the offgas system. Design of the system is
based on the system in use at the Goodyear Atomic Corporation at Ports-
‘mouth, Ohio. Since the quantity of fluorine to be disposed of is similar,
the same size equipment is used, except for the fluorine preheater, The

2
 

 

*»

"

31

fluorine at Portsmouth is diluted to about 10%, while the fluorination

_offgas will be nearly 100% fluorine toward the end of the processing. The
fluorine preheater can therefore be the same size as the SOz preheater, .

Some construction details have been changed to adapt the equipment to
remote radioactive service,

The equipment is shown in Fig. 3.10, and the design data for the sys-
tem are given in Table 3.6. Both ga streams are preheated to LOO°F
before contacting in the fluorine reactor. -Each preheater has three sepa-
rate heaters with installed spares. Each heater is controlled separately
by an off-on switch. The low-pressure steam coll on the inlet half of the

fluorine reactor supplies heat at the start to initiate the reaction and

acts as a coolant to remove the heat of reaction after the reaction
begins, Tt is desired to keep the “temperature below 1000°F to minimize
corrosion.

An activated alumina trap, Fig. 3.11, is installed downstream of the

“Fz reactor as mentioned in Section 2.2.5. The trap is installed with

ring-joint flanges and located in an accessible position to facilitate
replacement in case of plugging. The trap is constructed of 6-in. inconel.
pipe and contains ~ 3 £t> of activated alumina, enough to contain 1
trailer of fluorine. Two thermowells are provided near the inlet to indi-
cate fluorine breakthrough from the SOx system. The flanges are connected
to the leak detector system outside the cell. oo

3.3.8 Cubicle Exhauster ; -

The air in the absorber cubicle is maintained at a negative pressure

with respect to the high-bay area by an exhauster located in the fuel-

processing cell. This is an exhauster with a capacity of 250 cfm at
10.5 in, H20. It is driven by a 3/L-hp 3450-rpm L4o-v 3-phase motor.

The suction side is connected to the cubicle by a 4-in. steel pipe routed
"through the space west of the cell. The discharge is open to the cell

without any connecting piping. A L-in. plug cock is provided in the
suction line in the cubicle, with an access flange on the cubicle, to

permit closing the valve with the gasketed top in place for leak checking.

2-canister trap. This second trap contains ~ 3 ft ‘of. Cheney- T27 impreg-

nated charcoal which has & high efficiency for removal of organic 1odides
even under conditions of high moisture. This trap is constructed of 6- -in.

monel pipe with construction similar to the activated alunina trap
(Figure 3.11). Sh. - ,

-3.h,2 Flame Arrester

Since the system will be completely purged of air before processing

begins and all purge and sparge gases will be helium or nitrogen, there

is no possibility of producing an explosive mixture with hydrogen in the

equipment. The only: location involving an explosion hazard should be the

point of discharge of the of fgas into the offgas duct. At this point the
maximum concentration of hydrogen in the air is 1.4% with a hydrogen flow

rate of 50 liters/min and a cell air exhaust of 125 cfm, - This is well
below the Lover explosive limit of hydrogen in air of Le. The cell ex-
-haust flow rate will be checked at the time of processing to confirm that
there is sufficient ‘dilution,

As an added precaution, a flame arrester is installed in the offgas

‘line between the activated-charcoal trap. and the cell exhaust duct in the :

spare cell with a union downstream for removal for cleaning or replacement,
The unit is a Varac Model 514. -and consists of copper gauze and disk

laminations.

3.4.3 Offgas Filters

‘The fuel-processing cell ventilation air and the vessel offgas will
pass through a 2-in,-deep 24- by 2k-in. Fiberglas, prefilter and a 11- -1/2=in. .
~ deep 24- by 2h-in. Fiberglas absolute filter before passing through the
main filters and containment stack. There are three 12-in,-diam butterfly oo
"valves for isolation and for bypassing of the filters for replacement, A
‘locally’ mounted differential-pressure transmitter indicates the pressure
drop 8CToss the filters on the fuel-processing system panel board. The
caustic scrubber offgas, after passing through the charcoal trap and the
flame arrester, discharges into the duct Just upstream of the bypass tee.

This equipment is located in the spare cell with sufficient space
. allowed for the addition of 2 ft of shielding (for a total of 3-1/2 ft)
“between the filters and the fuel-processing cell. This should be sufficient
shielding to permit filter changing with en irradiated fuel batch in the
storage tank. |

3.4.4 HF Trap

The fluorine used will contain up to 5% HF, which could cause plugging
of the UFg absorbers by formation of NaF.2HF, NaF- 3HF, ete.) if not re- |
moved. Therefore the trap shown in Fig. 3.12 and described in Table 3.7
1s provided in the fluorine line at the gas supply station.

The inlet of ‘the trap is maintained at 212°F by steam to prevent
plugging (by prevention of the formation of the higher hydrogen fluoride
complexes) because of the high partial pressure of HF. Farther into the
NaF bed, the HF partial pressure is lower and the higher complexes are
* not formed even at the lower temperature. The exit of the trap is water -
cooled to about 100°F, which is below the operating temperature of the
UFe absorbers, and the trap should therefore remove any HF that could
otherwise collect in the absorbers. The reaction is exothermic and. -
liberates 16.k kcal pér mole of HF absorbed. | |
, With a fluorine flow of 50 liters/min, a processing time of 20 hr,
"and an HF content of 5%, the trap has sufficient capacity for the fluori-
nation of five batches’ if only 50% of the NaF is complexed to NaF-HF. BN
Since the average HF content is less than 5%, one loading should have suf- GO
ficient capacity for all the fluorinations ‘planned at the MSRE. If

necessary, the NaF can be discarded and recharged.

‘3.4.5 HF Heater

The HF heater is installed in the gas line from the HF cylinder
after the flow control valve. The purpose of this heater is to dissociate
the HF gas to the monomolecular form for accurate flow metering. This
‘requires the addition of approximately 1.2 Btu/liter of gas or approxi-
mately 20 Btu/min at the maximum HF flow rate anticipated (17 liters/min).
Another 1 -Btu/min of sensible heat is required to heat the gas from 120°F,
the temperature of the gas at 25 psig leaving the cylinder, to 180°F, the
temperature required to reach the monomolecular form. This 21 Btu/min is
equivalent to 370 w. Two tubular heaters are used to provide a total of
1120 w. ) oo CC
The heater is strapped to the outside of a 2-in, Monel plpe about:
22 in. long packed with nickel wool for heat transfer. The wool is con-
fined at the ends by 6-mesh Monel cloth. | A thermowell is provided near
the outlet.

- 3.4.6 Salt Sempler

The salt sampler in the fuel-processing system is mounted on the
roof plugs over the fuel-processing cell and is connected directly to
the top of the fuel storage tank by a vertical 1-1/2-in, pipe. The sam-
pler is the original fuel-pump sampler-enricher mockup shown in Fig. 3.13.
It is the same as the fuel-pump sampler, with the following exceptions:

1. It is designed for a maximum of 1h psig instead of 50 psig.

Area 1C is protected from overpressure by a pressure relief valve that
-vents to Area 2B which is vented to ‘the cell through the space around the |
1-1/2-in. sempling line.

2. No maintenance valve is required, since the system can be shut
down and purged if maintenance on the sampler is required.

3. Area 2B will contain the vacuum pumps in addition to the opera-
tional valve. | Co

L. A bellows is installed between the operational valve and the
sample line ‘instead of between the valves and Area 1C.

‘The sampler will not be used during processing. The fuel storage
tank will be purged with helium before the operational valve is opened
for sampling. The main purpose of the sampler is to verify that the salt
is satisfactory for return to the drain tank after processing. After
H--HF treatment the sample will be analyzed to determine that HF has been
reduced to satisfactory levels. After fluorination the sample will verify
“the complete removal of uranium. Also, sampling of flush salt before pro-
© cessing will indicate the amount’ ‘of fuel salt pickup.

The, sampler will have, in general, the same instrumentation as the
fuel-~pump sampler and will be operated in the same memner *

heaters are controlled by switches or powerstats located at two heater
control panels, HCV-12 and HCP-13, at the south end of the heater control
area on the 840-ft level east of the cell block. The pipe heaters in the
absorber cubicle are controlled by & switch at the cubicle in the high-bey

The pipe line and equipment heater, blower motor, and motorized
damper leads are routed from the heater control panels through a Junction
box on the west side of the decontamination cell on the 840-ft level. At
this Junction box the spare heaters can be connected to the control panels

- 1f necessary. Each control may have from -one to nine separate heaters.

Leads from each group of heaters are brought out to a junction box. De-
fective heaters can be replaced only by entering the cell, After the
cell becomes radioactive, only an entire group can be replaced unless the
cell is decontaminated to permit direct maintenance. |

3.7 Instrumentation

3.7.1 Thermocouples

All the temperature-measuring points in the fuel-processing system
are listed in Table 3.10. Two 12-pcint recorders (0 = 250°F and 0 - 1000°F)
and one 2k-point recorder (0 - 300°F) are installed at the fuel-processing
system panelboard and will record all measurements normally required for
processing.

The readings of the 46 thermocouples installed on the fuel storage
tank, salt lines, and freeze valves will ‘be recorded only in the main:
control room, since they will be required primarily for salt transfer.

The fuel storage tank temperatures will be checked occasionally. during
processing, but changes should be slow. |

3.7. 2 Annunciators

The fuel-processing system anmunciator points are listed in Table 3.11.
There are 11 anmnciators- on the chemical plant panelboard. In addition
there are 3 radiation alarms that indicate high gamma activity in the |

The siphon pot and cold trap are cooled by eirculating freon brine
(trichloromonofluoromethane). The maximum cooling loads are approxi-
"mately 2500 Btu/hr in the cold trap and an approximately 1200-Btu/hr heat
loss from the piping and equipment. A 1-1/2-hp water-cooled refrigeration
mit should provide sufficient capacity for brine temperatures as low as
-20°F. Brine is circulated by a carned-motor pump through insulated
:3/4-in.-0D copper tubing. The refrigeration unit and circulating pump
are located on the > 8ko- ft level west of the cell.

4. SAFETY ANALYSIS
kh, Summary and Conclusions

The maximum credible accident is a gas leak during fluorination. A
minimum of h minutes is ‘available to stop fluorine flow between detection
of 13171 tn the cell ventilation duct and before leakage of sufficient
iodine to produce a l-rem dose at the nearest point outside the controlled
area.

‘During fluorination of fuel salt, less than 0.3 curies of 1317 will
pass through the charcoal traps. undef the most severe conditions.

Because of the high loss of noble metel fission products (Te, Mo,
Ru, ete. ) during reactor operatipn, the mex fxm possible release of ‘these
isotopes is well within permissible limits,

The greatest penetrating radiation level in the operating ares will

be from 31T passing through the gas space in the UFs gbsorbers. This

can be easily shielded to reasonable levels. - .
Loss of TVA eleétrical power (described in Section 3. 5) would cause

~- no hazard and would only require suspension of processing until power

As indicated in Table 4.1, the diffusion factor for a stack release
under normal conditions is at e maximum at a distance of 325 meters from
the stack, and the ground concentration is a factor of 20 less at the
nearest point outside the restricted area, as shown in Fig. 4.1.

The MSRE stack is 100 ft high and has a flow capability of 20,000

4,2.2 Maximum Permissible Exposures

For normal operation, the maximum exposure from gaseous activity is

limited to 10% of the MPC for each isotope. Since processing will be

done no more frequently than once per year, exposures are averaged per

‘quarter for occupational workers and per year for persons outside the

controlled area. The limit for occupational workers is, therefore,

4.3 Gaseous Activity

 4,3.1 Activity Release from the Contaiment Stack

k, 3. 1. 1 Activity Released When Not Processing. A fully irradiated

© fuel batch will be held in the fuel drain tank, with The offgas passed to

a charcoal bed, until the xenon emission cannot cause a radiation level

in excess of 2, 5 mr /hr at the point of maximum ground concentration. From
Fig, h. 2 1t can be seen that an approximately four-day decay period 1a
required before transfer to ‘the fuel storage tank, which is not vented
through a charcoal bed. Since there is about 50 £t> of gas space in the
processing equipment, an irradiated fuel batch will not be transferred to
the fuel storage tank for 10 days at which time the decay rate will equal

the production rate and xenon accumulated in the’ gas space could not re-

sult in excessive release when purging 1s started,

}.3.1.2 Activity Released During Ho-HF Treatment. Although there
has been no work done on fission-product behavior under the highly re-
ducing conditions of the Ho-HF treatment, very little if any fission-
product volatilization is expected. All the fission products that could
form volatile fluorides are more noble than the structural metals,
chromium, iron, and nickel. Nickel, which is the most noble of the
structural metals will be limited to less than 1 ppm as NiFp with a
10:1 Hao-to-HF ratio, ‘Therefore, although no equilibrium quotients are

available for the fission-product fluorides, it is unlikely that any
niobium, ruthenium, antimony, “tellurfum, or iodine will exist in the salt
as the fluoride. However, it 1s possible that HI could form and become
“volatile. The activated charcoal trap will provide good. decontamination
‘for HI. :

CC

4.3.1.3 Activity Released During Fluorination. Recent "freeze

"valve" samples of fuel salt have shown >99% removal of noble metal (Te,

Ru, Nb, Mo) fission products during reactor operation. Table 4.2 shows

exposures from Te, Nb, and Ru to be below the MFC. ‘Removal of 99% of the
‘Nb and Ru in the NaF trap is ‘expected while no decontamination of Te 1s

allowed for. The charcoal traps will be tested by iodine injection and :
sampling to demonstrate a removal of at least 99.998%. This removal effici-

ency limits the 1311 release to less than 300 millicuries with 30 days decay.

4.3.1.4 Activity Released by Equipment Failure. The maximum credi-

ble accident is believed to be a leak during fluorination in the gas

space of the fuel. storage tank or in the piping between the FST and the
charcoal traps. This could be caused by unusually high localized cor-

‘rosion. Such a leak would be detected first by the duct 940 radiation

monitor. Figure 4.3 shows the time available to turn. off the fluorine

flow and stop the processing ‘after the alarm has ‘sounded. At “the ‘maximum
“possible leak rate (at ‘the volatilization rate of 4. 5 curies: of 131T per

minute) the monitor would reach alarm in 2 minutes. At ‘the nearest
point outside the’ controlled area (3200 m), the accumulated dose would be
1 rad if 30 curies of 131T were released. This would require 6.3 min or

4.3 mimites after the elarm. This should be ample time to react to the

“alarm and turn-off the fluorine flow. Any leak ‘smaller than this would

result in a longer time to reach the alarm point but the allowable re-

action time is much greater. } .
Table b. 2 indicates that the dosages from the other volatile ‘fission
products are very small scupRrsd with iodine.

4.3.2 Activity Release to the Operating Area

The high-bay area ‘above the fuel-processing cell will be used for
“operation of” ‘the fuel-processing system. The possible release of gaseous
‘activity into this area during. fuel processing through the roof plugs,
from the absorber cubicle, from the salt sampler, and from lines pene-
trating the cell walls was considered. .

4.3.2. 1 Activity Released Through the Roof Plugs. Leakage of ac-
tivity from the fuel-processing cell to the operating area 1s not con-
‘sidered credible for the following reasons: -

1. The cell is tightly sealed. All penetrations, piping, and
wiring are grouted and sealed with mastic or pass through sealed boxes,

2. A negative pressure will be maintained during processing. -

3. Processing can be guickly stopped. This would be done ‘suto-
matically in case of & power failure, which would close the shutoff valve
on the gas supply (Fe, HF, ‘and Hp). ‘The power failure would also stop
the flow of cooling air to the cubicle. This air exhausts to the cell
and is the only positive gas flow to the cell. A loss of ventilation

not caused by a general power failure is highly improbable since there 1s
a spare stack fan and the fens can be run with diesel power. Co
L.3.2.2 Activity Relessed from the Absorber Cubicle. The absorber -
cubicle is a sealed box of 3/16-in.~thick steel located near the instru-
"ment panel board in the high-bay area. It is located in the high-bay
area to facilitate handling of the portable absorbers following fluori-
nation. By means of the cubicle blower, the cubicle will be maintained
at a negative pressure with respect to, the cell, which will be negative.

to the high-bay area. Feilure of power to the blower will close the

 

 

solenoid valve in the air supply to the cubicle to avoid pressurization.
The maximum cubicle pressure with 100-£t7/min air flow will be  .
‘checked to demonstrate that a pressure greater -than 1 psig cannot be ‘ob-
tained with the blower off. If necessary, the maximm air flow will be
reduced below 100 £3 /min to prevent exceeding 1 psig. Prior to fluori-
“nation the vent valve will be closed, the cubicle pressure will be raised
to 1 psig, and the leak rate will be determined. Leakage must be less
than 75 cc/min. This rate of iodine leakage would allow 10 min of working
58
time in the high-bay area without masks. This is sufficient time to ‘shut
down and to evacuate the high-bay area, since the reactor will not be
operating during fuel processing. . : :

The presence of gaseous activity in the sbsorber cubicle will be de-
tected by a monitor that will be continuously sampling the cubicle air
during processing. If a lesk occurs, processing can be suspended, The
cubicle will then be purged with air to the cell, the cubicle top will
be removed, and ell joints will be checked for tightness. Smears from
each Joint should indicate the location of the leak,

4.3.4.3 Activity Released from the Cell Penetrations. All cell
penetrations connected directly to process equipment are provided with ©
check valves, most of which are located in a sealed instrument cubicle
along with the’ instrument transmitters. A backup of activity to the
check valves would be detected by a redistion monitor in the cubicle and
possibly by the ares monitors in the high-bey area. |

In addition to the lines routed through the instrument cubicle,
there are three other penetrations from the cell to the high-bay. area:
the salt sampler, which is discussed in the next section, “the salt-
charging line, and the caustic-charging line. The salt- -charging line
will be sealed with at least one freeze valve snd ¢apped when not charging
salt, The caustic-charging line to the caustic scrubber is provided with
two memal valves, Caustic will not be charged during processing, which
would be the -only time that pressure or © activity could be found in the
charging line. Co

, The waste-salt line to the spare cell will be sealed by a freeze
valve in the processing cell. The method of ‘waste-salt disposal has not
yet been determined. Co

4.3.2.4 Activity Released from the Salt Sampler. The fuel-processing

system sampler as mentioned in Section 3.4.6, is similar to the fuel-pump
sampler-enricher. Both samplers have similar instrumentation and will be
~used. with similar operating procedures. The fuel-storage tank will not
be sampled during processing. Before sampling, the sampling line and fuel
storage tank will be purged of gaseous activity. The sample capsule con-
‘taining the solid sample will be moved from the primary containment area,
1c (see Fig. 3.13) to a secondary containment area, 3A, where the sample
 

29
‘will be sealed inside & transport. container tube before being removed from

the sampler to a shielded carrier.
‘4.4 Penetrating Radiation

4.4.1 Normal Levels

4.4.1.1 "Operating Area. The radiation level in the high-bay area
over .the fuel-processing cell will be less than 10 mr/hr through the .
“4-fit-thick high-density-concrete roof plugs under the most severe con-
ditions with a fully irrediated, four- day- decayed ‘fuel salt batch in the
fuel storage’ tank. Since processing would not be started until the batch
had decayed for at least a few weeks, this level above ‘the cell should
cause no concern. Operations will be planned to limit exposure of indi-
‘viduals to less than 100 mr /week, end signs will be posted indicating
radiation levels at various ‘points in the high-bay ares,
The salt sampler will be shielded with 4 in, of lead, which should
reduce the radiation level from a fuel salt sample to less than 10 mr /hr.
It will be necessary to shield the sbsorber cubicle during processing
of a fully irradiated fuel batch. Since "freeze-valve'" salt’ samples have
shown that only ~ 1% of the calculated Mo is in the circulating salt
stream, absorbed activity is expected to be very low and shielding of the
_ absorbers should not be required. However X31T in the gas space in the
absorbers will require that the absorber cubicle be shielded with 1/2-in.
to 1-in. of lead. The radiation levels will be monitored during pro-
cessing and additional shielding and razinbion ? signs will be posted as
required, : “
k, I 1.2 Switch House. The only fuel-processing cell wall adjacent
to an occupied ares is the west wall bordering the switch house, The
h-ft area ‘between: ‘the switch house and the cell will be filled vith
stacked concrete blocks. When a fully irradiated fuel batch is in the
storage tank, the level at the east wall of the switch house should be
less than 5 mr/hr. :
© 4.4.1.3 Spare Cell. The east wall of the fuel-processing cell ad-
‘joins the spare cell where the activated-charcoal trap, offgas filters,

: dampers, differential -pressure transmitter, and nyazogen flame arrester
are located. A blanked waste salt line extends into this cell for future
removal of waste salt. Two feet of stacked concrete block shielding is
provided between ‘the cell wall and the above equipment. This will provide
sufficient shielding (a total of 3-1/2 ft) to permit replacing the offgas
filters without exceeding planned exposures. The dose rate should be

~ less than 50 mr/hr, -

EN The charcoal beds will be shielded with 16 in. of verytes concrete.
This will reduce the radiation level at the filters to <30 mren/hr with
all the: iodine from a fuel, batch on the beds after 30 deys decay.

processing cell borders, the decontamination cell. There would probably

Plugs off and & fully irradieted batch in the fuel storage tank,

4.4.1.5 Aree Surrounding the Waste Cell, The maximum- activity ex-
pected in the caustic solution from the hydrofluorination of a 28- -day-
"decayed fuel batch is 11,000 curies of iodine, assuming complete removal
-in the scrubber. During the time this activity is in the liquid waste

tank, there must be limited access to the areas above and around ‘the

vaste cell, and radiation warning signs must be posted.
4.4.2 Unusual Radiation Levels Lo i

‘4.4.2.1 From Irradiated Salt.. There are two dip tubes in the fuel

storage tank into which -salt could accidentally back up: the salt-transfer

line and the gas-sparging line. The salt-transfer line is connected to
the spare cell by the waste salt line and to the high-bay ares by the
salt-charging line, Both lines have freeze valves that are normally
frozen. In addition, the end of each line will be capped when not in
use, : } Co
The gas-sparging line passes through the area west of the cell to
the instrument cubicle and then to the gas supply station. An air valve

located in the instrument cubicle actuates a valve in the cell which opens

if the tank pressure ‘exceeds the purge pressure and vents the line to the
top of the tank to prevent salt backup. If a plug should occur, it could
be thawed with installed electric heaters without entering the cell.

‘hh2, 2 From Caustic Solution. Most of the iodine in the salt may
be volatilized as HI during Ho-HF treatment. There will ‘probably be some

deposition on metal surfaces before the HI reaches the caustic scrubber

‘but most of the iodine reaching the scrubber will be collected there,
The meximm iodine concentration in the scrubber solution will be 2 c/gal

from flush selt processing and Lo: c/gal from fuel salt processing. The
caustic solution can either be diluted to 5 c/gal or allowed to decay for
an additional 2h days before transferring to the intermediate level vaste
system collection tank. The piping and pump conteining the radioactive
scrubber solution is shielded but’ masks, protective clothing, and Health
Physics surveillance are required for the ‘sampling operation;.

The solution could possivly get. into unshielded lines in the

following ways: SE

1. Pressuring of the scrubber tank during processing and plugging
of the vent line or flame arrester could force some solution up the jet

‘steam line, but this line is shielded to approximately 25 ft from the

jet and backup this far into a closed line is unlikely. The pressure
alarms on both the fuel storage tank and the caustic scrubber would pro-

vide sufficient warning to stop processing ‘before a. dangerous pressure

was ‘reached.

2. Pressuring of the scrubber tank during Jetting plus * plugging
of the vent line or fleme arrester and plugging of the jet discharge
line to the waste tank could cause steam to back up through the caustic

‘solution. Considerable time would be required to build up sufficient
. pressure (1 psig) to force solution up the sparge line to the absorber

cubicle, Pressure alarms and radiation monitors would provide warning

far in advance of eny hazard.

“3. A vacuum in-the Jet line ‘could pull solution into the ‘steam
line. If’ the jet discharge line should plug and jetting should stop,
condensing steam could create such a vacuum. A check valve tees into.

the steam line and will prevent 8 .vacuum from forming in this line.

bh. Cooling of the fuel storage tank without gas purges to the
tank could cause a vacuum in the tank and offgas piping to the scrubber.
A power failure could cause cooling of the tank but would not stop the
 

62

‘helium purges. In the event of a prolonged power failure and cooling of
the fuel storage tank, the caustic scrubber would be jetted to the waste

tank,

4.4.2.3 From Radioactive Gas. The sampling line is the only gas
line from the fuel storage tank to the operating area, Steps will be
.teken as indicated in Section 4.3.2.4 to keep gaseous activity out of the
sampler, Sparging for 1 hr with helium should reduce the activity in the
gas space. by 8 factor of 10°. Complete filling of the ssmpler access
chamber with atmosphere from the fuel storage tank would result in 8
radiation level 10 times less than that from a fully irredisted fuel
salt sample. Co
