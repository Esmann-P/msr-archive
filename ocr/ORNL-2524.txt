SUMMARY

Results of an alloy development program at the Oak Ridge
National Iaboratory have shown an alloy within the composition range
15/17 per cent molybdenum - 6/8 per cent chromium - 4/6 per cent iron -
0.04/0.08 per cent carbon - balance nickel, designated as INOR-8, to be
an attractive structural material for use in a nuclear power reactor
fueled with molten-uranium-bearing fluoride salts.

The present study enlarges upon the technology of the alloy
INOR-8 through an investigation of the influence of camposition vari-
ation upon the 1500°F creep-rupture strength and microstructure of
alloys encompassed by the range 10/20 per cent molybdenum - 5/10 per
cent chromium - 4/10 per cent iron - O.5 per cent aluminum - 0.5 per
cent manganese - 0.06 per cent carbon - balance nickel. The campo-
sition of the individual alloys was varied systematically with the
intent that by direct comparison the effect of an element upon strength
could be determined. All alloys were tested in creep-rupture at a
stress of 10,000 psi in the annealed condition. The criteria used to
evaluate the strength of the alloys were the times required to reach
strains between 1 and 10 per cent.

The results could not be explained in simple terms of compo-
sition variation since the principal factors affecting the strength

of the alloys were: solid-solution elements, carbide and non-carbide

 
On

aging reactions, the presence of M C-type carbides in the micro-
structures, and grain size.

From the standpoint of their creep-rupture strength, it was
possible to conveniently group the alloys according to the three con-
centrations of molybdenum studied: 10, 15, and 20 per cent. It could
be concluded from the analyses and microstructures of these alloys that
the relative strength contribution of each of the previously mentioned
factors varied between the individual groups.

The combined effects of solid-solution strengthening by molyb-
denum and the increase in quantity of dispersed MC-type carbides which
this element pramoted in the annealed materials were the predominant
factors which increased the strength of the alloys grouped by molyb-
denum content. The only exception noted was in the case of the 20 per
cent molybdenum ~ 7 per cent chromium - 10 per cent iron alloy which
precipitated a non-carbide phase as a consequence of crossing a new
phase boundary. This phase contributed noticeably to creep-rupture
strength in the later stages of test.

The contribution of chromium and iron to the strength of the
alloys within the individual groups could not be established with
certainty due to simultaneous variations in other factors affecting
creep-rupture behavior.

To obtain a better indication of the strengthening influence of
chromium and iron, creep-rupture studies were conducted on low-carbon
"high-purity" alloys. Although an analysis of the data was complicated

by the presence of a limited amount of carbide precipitation and by
grain-size variations, the influence of chromium was found to be
significant when 5 to 10 per cent was added to the 15 per cent
molybdenum - balance nickel base. However, the presence of 10 per
cent chromium in the base composition showed the most pronounced
strengthening influence. The strengthening effect of iron was inter-
preted as being insignificant when amounts up to 10 per cent were
added to the 15 per cent molybdenum - 7 per cent chromium - balance
nickel base.

A general consideration of all data obtained from this investi-
gation favorably supports the composition specification placed upon the

alloy INOR-8.

 
CHAPTER II
INTRCTUCTION

The advancement in the technology of a nuclear power reactor
fueled with molten~uranium-bearing fluoride salts has been concerned,
in part, with the development of a structural material which will be
compatible with the reactor operating conditions. In such a reactor
the material would be subjected to several corrosive environments at
elevated temperatures in addition to complex stresses derived from
flowing fluids, temperature gradients, and thermal cycles; conse-
quently, it is necessary that the material meet rigid requirements,
among them being:

1. sufficient strength and reasonable ductility at elevated
temperatures;

2. good corrosion resistance to the molten fluoride salts;

3. good oxidation resistance:

I, favorable fakricability for the production of a variety
of shapes; 1l.e., plate, sheet, bar, wire, tubing, etc.

5. good weldabillty and brazeability; and

6. suitable nuclear properties.

It has been found through various test programs conducted over
the past several years, that of the commercially available alloys,

xX
Inconel (80 Wi - ib Cr - 6 Fe) ard Hastelloy B {67 Ni - 28 Mo - 5 Fe)

 

*
All alloy compositions are expressed in welght per cent.

 
 

vere the most pramising for this application; however, neither is an
"ideal" material with respect to the above requirements. With parti-
cular regard to the elevated temperature strength of the two alloys,
Hastelloy B is much superior to Inconel at 1500°F, as shown in

Figure 1. In structures fabricated from Inconel, specification of
design stresses must take into account the deterioration of its
strength due to a significant amount of corrosion by the molten
fluoride salts as well as that due to temperature. Thus, in many
cases, Inconel becomes a marginal alloy where thin sections are en-
countered. Hastelloy B, on the other hand, is virtually unaffected
by the molten fluoride salts and, at the same time, possesses high
strength; however, extended service in the temperature range of approxi-
mately 1200 — 1600°F results in a decrease in its ductility to such a
degree that it also becomes a marginal material.

A recent study of the aging characteristics of Hastelloy B by

R. E. Clausing, et al,’ has shown the most prominent loss in ductility
of the alloy to occur after aging at 1300°F, due to the precipitation
of an intermetallic compound interpreted as being the beta phase

(Ni) Mo) of the nickel-molybdenum system. Between 1500°F and 1650°F,
the precipitate observed upon aging was different fram that noted at
1300°F and was tentatively identified as the gamma phase (wi Mo).
‘The effect of the gamma phase on decreasing the tensile ductility of
Hastelloy B was not quite so marked as that of the lower temperature
beta phase. The assumed intermetallic compounds were deduced from the

nickel-molybdenum equilibrium diagram’ shown 1n Figure 2, it being

recognized that the presence of iron and other elements in Hastelloy B
could have an influence on the location of the phase boundaries.

In view of the over-all requirements of the "ideal" alloy, it
became apparent that these could best be met by a material having the
desirable features of Inconel and Hastelloy B. During the past few
years, an alloy development program at the Oak Ridge National
laboratory has been concerned with the evaluation of numerous nickel-
base alloys with a primary strengthening addition of 15 — 20 per cent
molybdenum. This amount of molybdenum is within the solubility limits
of molybdenum in nickel at elevated temperatures, and therefore, em-
brittlement associated with the precipitation of Ni Mo, intermetallic
compounds does not occur. Subsequent additions made to the nickel-
molybdenum base camposition to augment its properties included such
elements as chromium, iron, niobium, vanadium, tungsten, aluminum,
titanium, end carbon. Data obtained from screening tests designed to
investigate strength, fluoride-salt corrosion, oxidation, fabricability,
and weldability of the various alloys showed the necessity of a com=
position balance since enhancement of a particular property was obtained
at the expense of one or more other properties. At the present time,
the best compromise material, in light of the original requirements of
the "ideal" alloy, is the camposition, 15/17 Mo ~ 6/8 Cr = 4/6 Fe -
0.04/0.08 C ~ balance Ni, designated as INOR-8. This alloy is classi-
fied as the solid-solution type with the exception, however, of carbide

particles which are stable over a wide temperature range.

 
 

During the course of the alloy screening tests the potential
importance of a number of variables became evident. Among those
variables incompletely understood were the influence of heat treatment,
melting practice, and changes in composition upon the strength of a
given alloy. Of these three subjects, it was believed that a program
set up to investigate the influence of composition variation upon the
strength, as well as the microstructure, of alloys within a range
encompassing that of the alloy INOR-8 would prove the most beneficial.
Such an investigation was carried out and is described in the following

chapters,

CHAPTER III
OBJECTIVE

The objective of this investigation was to determine the
influence of composition variation upon the 1500°F creep-rupture
strength and microstructure of molybdenum-chroniun-iron-nickel base
alloys. The alloys for this study were encompassed by the range
10/20 Mo - 5/10 Cr - 4/10 Fe - 0.5 AL - 0.5 Mn - 0.06 C - balance Ni.
The composition of the individual alloys was varied systematically with
the intent that by direct comparison, the effect of an element upon

strength could be determined.

 
CHAPTER IV

EXPERIMENTAL, PROCEDURE

Two general series (I and II) of alloys were prepared for this
investigation. Series I was prepared to show the influence of vari-
ations in the molybdenum, chromium, and iron contents at a constant
carbon content on the creep-rupture behavior and microstructure of the
resultant alloys. The melting stock used for preparing the alloys of
this series was of the following reported purity: nickel pellets,
99.9 per cent; sintered molybdenum bar ends, 99.8 per cent; alumino-
thermic chromium, 99.3 per cent with approximately 1000 ppm oxygen;
vacuum-melted ingot iron, 99.9 per cent; and carbon in the form of
graphite. Aluminum and manganese were added as malleableizing agents.
Previous work with nickel-molybdenum=-chromium alloys at ORNL has shown
them to be subject to cracking during hot-rolling in the absence of
melleableizers, even though the alloys were prepared by vacuum-melting
techniques from reportedly good-quality melting stock. It is believed
that the hot-cracking tendencies are caused, principally, by the
residual gases present in the materials.

The presence of carbon in the alloys of series I produced creep-
rupture results which indicated that carbon through carbide formation
was masking the strengthening influence of chromium and iron. This
fact prompted the preparation of the alloys of series II. The alloys
of series II are referred to as "high-purity" alloys and were prepared

from the same nickel and iron melting stock as the alloys of series I;

 

 
-10-

however, arc-cast molybdenum and special high-purity chromium flakes
(140 ppm oxygen) were substituted for the sintered molybdenum bar ends
and alumino-thermic chromium, respectively. No intentional carbon or

malleableizing agents were added to the alloys of series II.

Melting and Casting

All alloys were prepared by vacuum-induction-melting. A total
charge of 1450 grams per alloy was placed in a zirconia crucible, out-
gassed by intermittent application of power, and finally melted under a
vacuum of approximately 100 microns of mercury. Each alloy was held in
the molten state from twenty to thirty minutes tc insure solution of the
charge, and then cast into a graphite mold to form an ingot one and one-

half inches in diameter by four inches in length, excluding the hot-top.

Ingot Analysis

The hot-tops were cut fram the ingots and turnings for chemical
analysis were taken from the bottom of each hot-top across the entire
transverse section. A prior skin cut, which was discarded, was made on
the outside diameter of the hot-tops before collecting the turnings.

The results of the analyses performed by the Analytical Chemistry
Division of ORNL are shown in Table I. The nominal composition of each
alloy based upon the weight of the elements making up the charge is also
given in Table I for comparison. In general, the nominal compositions

were in good agreement with the analyzed compositions.

Ingot Fabrication

The rough, as-cast surface of each lngot was ground smooth
prior to break-down accomplished by hot-rolling in air at a furnace
temperature of 2150°F. Reductions of 50 mils in thickness per pass
were given from the initial one and one-half inch diameter to 0,750
inch thick. From a thickness of 0.750 inch to 0.275 inch reductions
of 30 mils in thickness per pass were given. After hot-rolling, the

3 of 10 per cent

alloy strips were pickled in a hot aqueous solution
sulphuric acid containing 5 per cent by weight of sodium nitrate and

5 per cent by weight of sodium chloride. At this stage the materials
were examined visually and edge and surface cracks which developed
during hot-rolling were ground out. The strips were subsequently cold-
rolled to 0.065 inch thick at a reduction schedule of approximately

3 mils in thickness per pass. Although alloys of this type work-harden
quite rapidly, it was possible to cold-roll fram 30 to 4O per cent in
thickness before an intermediate annealing treatment for one-half hour
at 2150°F in a hydrogen atmosphere. The above procedure was followed
as nearly as possible for all the alloys.

In general, the fabricability of both series of alloys as
determined by the extent of cracking during hot-rolling was satis-
factory with one exception being an alloy of series I, VI-60 (20 Mo -
7 Cr - 10 Fe - 0.5 AL - 0.5 Mn - 0.06 C ~ balance Ni). Strip suitable
for creep-rupture specimens could not be obtained due to excessive

cracking.

Creep~Rupture Testing

The creep-rupture tests were carried out in the Mechanical
Properties Laboratory of the ORNL Metallurgy Division. A description
of the creep~testing facilities of this Laboratory has been reported
previously by D. A. Douglas and W. D. Manly. Details from this report
which were pertinent to this investigation, i.e., description of appa-
ratus, are presented in the Appendix.

After stress-relieving the 0.065-inch-thick strip for one-half
hour at 1600°F, two sheet-type creep-rupture specimens, as illustrated
in Figure 3, were machined from each alloy. Prior to test, all
specimens were annealed at 2100°F for one-half hour in a hydrogen
atmosphere followed by cooling in the furnace cold-zone considered
equivalent to an air-cool. Each specimen was tested in creep-rupture
at a stress of 10,000 psi (constant load), a temperature of 1500°F, and
in an inert atmosphere of argon. After fixing a specimen in a creep
frame, the temperature was brought up to 1500°F. The control tempera-
ture during test as well as the temperature gradient along the specimen
gage length was maintained within * 5°F. Loading of the specimen tock
place immediately upon achieving a uniform temperature along the gage
length.

For the alloys of series I, microscopic and dial-gage extension
readings were taken every two hours during the first eight hours of the
test, and thereafter, readings were made once every twenty-four hours
until rupture occurred. Extension readings were made on the "high-

purity” alloys of series II every one-half hour during the initial

stages of test to closely follow the strain vs time curves to 1 per
cent strain. Thereafter, readings were taken on these alloys every
two hours. After a specimen ruptured, it was allowed to furnace-cool
and a total elongation measurement was made.

The criteria used to evaluate the strength of the alloys were
times to 1, 2, 5, and 10 per cent strain. Because more frequent
extension readings were made on the “high-purity” alloys during the
initial stages of test, the time to 0.5 per cent strain was also used
as a strength criterion for this series of alloys.

In order to make a relative comparison of the strengths of the
alloys, a three and one-half inch gage length was arbitrarily selected
for computing the per cent strain from the extension measurements. The

point of zero elongation was taken as the reading obtained immediately

after the application of the full load on the specimen.

Grain Size Measurements

The standard annealing treatment given each creep-rupture
specimen prior to test produced different grain sizes between the
various alloys, thus introducing another variable to be considered in
evaluating the test results. To obtain an indication of the variation,
grain-size measurements were made on a longitudinal section of an
unstressed end of one creep-rupture specimen per alloy using the Heyn

>

Procedure. Briefly, the method consists of counting the number of

grains in a magnified image of the specimen intersecting a line of

 
-18-

known length. By dividing the length of the line by the product of the
number of intersecting grains times the magnification, a value of the
average grain diameter is obtained. Each reported grain size repre=
sents an average of ten readings taken at different locations in a

given sample.

Aging Studies

All alloys of series I were investigated for thelr aging res=-
ponse. Coupons were cut from the 0.065-inch-thick strip, annealed one-
half hour at 2100°F in a hydrogen atmosphere and cooled in the furnace
cold zone. All coupons were placed in a quartz tube, sealed off under
a vacuum of 0.1 micron of mercury, and then aged at 1500°F for 5, 25,
50, 100, and 1000 hours. All aging heat-treatments were carried out
in Kanthal-wound furnaces which were constructed at ORNL. Chromel-
alumel thermocouples were used for controlling and recording tempera=-
ture. Periodically, furnace temperatures were checked with a
standardized platinum/platinum-10 per cent rhodium thermocouple and
a Rubicon Potentiometer. Figure 4 shows a photograph of the heat-
treating furnaces with thelr temperature-controlling and recording
instruments. Upon completion of all aging treatments, the capsules
were crushed under water to effect rapid cooling of the coupons.

A surface of each coupon parallel to the rolling direction was
prepared for metallographic examination using the procedure to be

described later. The aging response of the alloys was determined by

hardness measurements made on these specimens as well as a solution-
annealed standard of each alloy. The average hardness reported for a
given specimen represents an average of four measurements taken at
different locations on the specimen. All hardness measurements were
made with a Wilson Tukon Micro-Hardness Tester using a 10 kilogram
load with a 16 millimeter objective and a 136° diamond pyramid
indenter.

Because carbide precipitation was not anticipated in the "high-
purity" alloys of series II, but did occur to a limited extent as will
be pointed out in Chapter V, one coupon of each alloy of this series
was aged for 100 hours at 1500°F to determine its "equilibrium"
structure. Hardness and. metallographic studies were performed on

these specimens and a solution-annealed standard.

Decarburization Studies

In order to present evidence that certain observed precipitates
were carbide particles, selected compositions were subjected to a
decarburization treatment and examined for the disappearance of precipi-
tates. The treatment consisted of rolling alloy strip to 0.012 inch. .
thick, heat-treating for 100 hours at 2200°F in a hydrogen atmosphere
to effect decarburization, dropping the furnace temperature to 1500°F
and aging for an additional 100 hours, followed by water-quenching from
temperature. The microstructures of the alloys were examined and com-

pared with the microstructures of the same alloys after aging at 1500°F

 
-2]1-

in an evacuated quartz capsule. A carbon analysis was also obtained on
the decarburized materials.

The alloys subjected to this treatment included: 10 and 15 per
cent molybdenum alloys of series I with the lowest and highest chramium
plus iron contents; 20 per cent molybdenum alloys of series I con-
taining 5 per cent chromium plus 4 and 10 per cent iron; and the "high-
purity" alloys of series II containing 7 per cent chramium plus O, 7,

and 10 per cent iron.

Metallographic Studies and Procedures

In addition to a solution-annealed coupon of each alloy, the
alloy specimens aged for carbide precipitation at 1500°F, and those
subjected to the decarburization treatment, metallographic studies
were conducted on an as-cast specimen taken from the ingot hot-top of
each alloy, and longitudinal and transverse sections in both the gage
length and grip of one creep-rupture specimen per alloy.

All speclmens which were prepared for metallographic examination
were first mounted in the conventional manner in bakelite. Initial
grinding was done on lead laps employing American Optical 302, 303-1/2,
and 305 corrundum abrasive (listed in order of decreasing particle

Polisher. Three steps were used for intermediate and final polisiing:
(1) a silk cloth with 0.3 micron aluminum oxide abrasive (Linde A),

(2) a micro cloth with Linde A abrasive, and (3) a micro cloth with

 
“00.

0.1 micron aluminum oxide abrasive (Iinde B). After polishing, all
specimens were etched in glycera regia consisting of 1 part HNO,
3 parts HCl, and k parts glycerine. Photomicrographs were made with

a Bausch and Lamb Research Metallograph using bright fleld illumination.

CHAPTER V
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
CREEP-RUPTURE STUDIES

The interpretation of the creep-rupture data obtained from the
alloys studied for this investigation could not adequately be made in
gimple terms of composition variations. This complication arose since
camposition variations caused not only solid-solution strengtheding,
but also, variations in grain size, dispersed particles, and precipi-
tation reactions within the materials. Analysis of the data showed
that these factors, which are known to affect the creep-rupture be-
havior of an alloy, were interrelated to varylng degrees in establishing
the properties of the alloys. The observed creep-rupture behavior,
therefore, is the resultant of these combined variables.

The carbon Intentionally added to the alloys of series I was
very effective in introducing into these materiels changes in the micro-
structure which affect creep-rupture behavior. For illustration,
Figures 5, 6, and 7 show the as-cast microstructures of three alloys of
series I at the different molybdenum contents with 7 per cent chromium -
4 per cent iron - 0.5 per cent aluminum - 0.5 per cent manganese -

0.06 per cent carbon - balance nickel. In gddition to the faece~centered-
cubic matrix, sll contained at least one additional phase which formed
by a eutectic decamposition in the 15 and 20 per cent molybdenum alloys
and which apparently precipitated fram solid solution in the 10 per

cent molybdenum alloy. In contrast, the as-cast microstructure of a

low-carbon "high-purity” alloy of series II with 15 per cent
molybdenum - 7 per cent chromium - 4 per cent iron - balance nickel

is shown in Figure 8. The cleanliness of this microstructure indicates
that the second phase observed in the 0.06 per cent carbon alloys was a
carbide.

Microstructures developed in these alloys after rolling the
ingots to 0.065-inch-thick strip, and solution-annealing specimens of
each at 2100°F for one-half hour in a hydrogen atmosphere are shown in
Figures 9, 10, 11, and 12, By camparing Figures 9, 10, and 11, a trend
was established with respect to an increasing quantity of globular M.C-
type carbides present as stringers in the materials with an increasing
molybdenum~to-carbon ratio. The presence of these carbides influenced
the as-solution annealed grain size of the series I alloys with the
result that it ranged from coarse to fine, depending upon the total
quantity of particles present. Furthermore, a fine-grain-boundary
precipitate was found in the alloys with 10 and 15 per cent molybdenum
which was presumably a carbide formed during cooling of the specimens
to room temperature. The fine-grain-boundary precipitate was for the
most part absent in the 20 per cent molybdenum alloys which reflected a

tie-up of most of the total carbon in the globular M C-type carbides.

 

*Recent work? performed by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation
for ORNL has shown the microstructure of an as-forged sample of the
alloy INOR-8 with 0.13 per cent carbon to contain large globular parti-
cles. These particles were identified as an MgC-type carbide by x-ray
diffraction analysis of the residue obtained from electrolytic dis-
solution of the sample. X-ray spectrographic analysis of this residue
showed molybdenum to be the principal constituent together with nickel.
The MC carbide was, therefore, considered to be (Mo, N1),C.

The hydrogen atmosphere used during solution-annealing effective-
ly caused decarburization around the edges of the 0.06 per cent carbon
alloys, particularly at the 10 and 15 per cent molybdenum concen-
trations resulting in a grain-size gradient in these alloys. Grain-
slze measurements reported for the elloys, however, included the
average of all grains across the thickness of a given specimen.

A presentation of the creep-rupture data which were obtained on
the various alloys follows in this chapter, and are discussed in terms

of the severmsl variables which were encountered.

Manganese - 0.06 Per Cent Carbon and Varying Percentages of Chromium

 

and Iron

A summary of the creep-rupture data obtained on the 10 per cent
molybdenum alloys of series I is presented in Table II and illustrated
by the graph in Figure 13. Each creep-rupture test has been repre-
sented by a bar in Flgure 13 on which is indicated at the appropriate
times, strains of 1, 2, 5, and 10 per cent as well as the specimen
elongation at fracture. The times to the specified values of strain
were interpolated from a plot of strain vs time for each test.

Obvious metallurgical factors which could have influenced the
measured creep rate of this group of alloys were: a wvarimtion in grain
size between the individual alloys, carbide precipitation occurring
within the alloys at 1500°F, and variations in the chromium and iron
contents. In addition, a certain amount of scatter existed between

the data for the duplicate tests of any one alloy.

The results of average grain-diameter measurements on an un-
stressed portion of the creep-rupture specimens are shown in Table II.
A reason for the variation in grain size was found in that greater
numbers of stringers produced finer grain sizes. The amount of carbide
stringering, however, could net be correlated well with the carbon
analyses of the alloys. This lack of correlation was attributed to
the possibility of carbide segregation being present in the alloys, or
that the annealing treatments given the alloys during ingot fabrication
caused decgrburization. If either or both of these explanations be
valid, then the carbon content of an individual sample was not repre-
sentative of the analyzed carbon content of the parent ingot.

The alloys of this group were all found to be subject to carbide
precipitation. Table IIT shows the range and average hardness of the
varlous coupons of each alloy after solution-annealing at 2100°F and
subsequent aging at 1500°F. Figure 14 is a graphical representation of
the average hardness of each alloy as a function of time at 1500°F,
canpared with its hardness in the solution-annealed condition. In
general, peek hardness of the alloys was reached after 25 to 50 hours
at temperature. It should be mentioned that some scatter was encoun-
tered in the hardness values obtained on the various coupons. This
could be attributed to orientation effects accentuated by large grain
size as well as segregation effects of carbide banding in the rolling
direction.

A general correlation could be made between the hardness change

upon aging at 1500°F and the resultant microstructures. To illustrate

this, Figure 15 shows a series of photomicrographs taken of alloy VT-43
(10 Mo - 5Cr - 4 Fe - 0.5 AL - 0.5 Mn - 0,06 C - balance Ni) during
the course of aging in the absence of mechanical stress. In the
solution-annealed condition, the microstructure contained a fine-grain-
boundary precipitate and a few stringers of larger M C-type carbides.
After five hours at 1500°F, a matrix precipitate was in the early stages
of development with fine particles being precipitated along preferred
crystallographic planes. The progress of precipitation continued with
time when, after 50 hours, discrete particles were observed which
showed only slight change in size up to 1000 hours at temperature. The
microstructure of the gage length of a creep-rupture specimen of alloy
VI-L43 is shown in Figure 16 and was found to be identical to that
observed in the unstressed coupons aged for 50 hours or more.

It was significant to note that the aging response of alloy
VI=L43 was greater in terms of peak hardness and quantity of precipi-
tated carbides than that shown by the other alloys of this group. An
apparent correlation existed between this fact and the reported carbon
content of 0.076 per cent for alloy VT-43 which was higher than that
reported for the other compositions.

The least amount of aging, noted metallographically in the 10 per
cent molybdenum alloys was found in alloy VI-54 (10 Mo - 10 Cr - 10 Fe -
0.5 AL ~ 0.5 Mn - 0.06 C - balance Ni). Figure 17 shows typical micro-
structures exhibited by this alloy upon aging. During the early stages
there was evidence of precipitation of fine carbides within the grains,

but longer times at temperature promoted a concentration of these

precipitates at the grain and twin boundaries. On the other hand, the
microstructure of the gage length of a creep-rupture specimen of this
alloy illustrated in Figure 18 showed bands of a fine matrix precipi-
tate but still of lesser quantity than in the case of alloy VT-43,
Although it is felt that the difference in quantity of precipitated
carbides between the two alloys is related to a larger difference in
their total carbon contents than indicated by the analyses, it is
recognized that a change in carbon solubility may have been effected by
the variation in chromium and iron contents.

Because of inconsistencies in the factors which affect creep-
rupture behavior, it was not possible to satisfactorily rationalize the
strengths of the alloys. A possible comparison could be made between
the strengths of alloys VI-43 and VI-53 where the principal difference
between the alloys was a 5 per cent increase in the chromium content of
the latter over the former with average grain diameters being compara-
ble. The slightly-higher average strength of alloy VI-53 up to 5 per
cent strain could have been attributed to the increased chramium con-
tent. A more realistic evaluation of the alloys of this group, however,
was the generalization that their strengths were not grossly different
as a result of a summation of the factors affecting creep-rupture
behavior. Their strengths, also, exceeded that of Inconel but were
inferior to that of Hastelloy B which will be shown to be true for all

alloys of series I.

15 Per Cent Molybdenum Alloys with 0.5 Per Cent Aluminum - 0.5 Per Cent
Manganese - 0.06 Per Cent Carbon and Varying Percentages of Chramium
and Iron

A summary of the creep-rupture data obtained on the 15 per cent
molybdenum alloys of series I is presented in Table IV and illustrated
by the bar-graph in Figure 19. These data have been presented in the
same manner as the data for the 10 per cent molybdenum alloys discussed
previously. Again, it was found that several factors in addition to
solid-solution effects of molybdenum could have influenced the measured
creep rate, specifically: grain-size variations, dispersed M C-type
carbides, slight aging tendencies, and variations in the chromium and
iron contents.

Referring to Figure 10, illustrating a solution-annealed micro-
structure of a 15 per cent molybdenum alloy with 0.06 per cent carbon,
it can be seen that a considerable number of M C-type carbides remained
undissolved after the solution-annealing treatment at 2100°F. These
particles were very effective in reducing the as-annealed grain size of
these alloys relative to the as-annealed grain size of the 10 per cent
molybdenum alloys. Average grain-diameter measurements on an unstressed
portion of the creep-rupture specimens shown in Table IV also indicated
a variation in grain size between the individual alloys of this group.
The decrease in average grain diameter in the materials upon increasing
the iron content from 4 to 10 per cent at the three chromium levels has
been attributed to an increase in quantity of M C-type carbides dis-

persed in the alloys. The widest grain-size variation occurred between

the 7 per cent chromium alloys which are campared in Figures 20 and 21.
In general, the difference in quantity of dispersed MgC-type carbides
was supported by the analyzed carbon contents of the alloys.

Comparison of the range and average hardnesses of these alloys
in the annealed and aged conditions is shown in Table V, and the
average hardnesses are plotted in Figure 22. Compared to the 10 per
cent molybdenum alloys, the 15 per cent molybdenum alloys were harder
and showed less aging response. The 15 per cent molybdenum alloys
contained a greater number of M C-type carbides which did not dissolve
upon solution-annealing. As a result, the amount of total carbon
available for reprecipitation as carbide particles was less upon aging
at 1500°F.

A correlation between microstructure and hardness was found for
all alloys of this group. Because similar microstructures were devel-
oped within the materials upon aging and creep-rupture testing,
representative photomicrographs are presented only for the materials
with the lowest and highest alloy contents. The microstructures of the
aged material with the lowest alloy content, VI-L45 (15 Mo - 5 Cr -

4 Fe - 0.5 AL - 0.5 Mn ~ 0.06 C - balance Ni) are shown in Figure 23.
After five hours at 1500°F, there was an indication of a grain=boundary
reaction. The only apparent change in microstructure for aging times
greater than 5 hours was for the grain-boundary particles to became
somewhat more discrete and show coalescence after aging for 1000 hours.
The application of stress did not have a measurable effect on the

microstructure of this alloy, as shown in Egure 24. The microstructures

developed by the material with the highest alloy content, VI-56 (15 Mo -
10 Cr - 10 Fe - 0.5 AL - 0.5 Mn - 0.06 C - balance Ni), after aging and
creep-rupture testing are shown in Figures 25 and 26, respectively.

The creep strength of the 15 per cent molybdenum alloys was
greater than that of the 10 per cent molybdenum alloys. The principal
contributing factors to this increased strength were undoubtedly the
solid-solution strengthening effect of molybdenum, and the carbide
dispersion strengthening effect. These were of sufficient magnitude to
overcome the advantage of coarser grain size held by the 10 per cent
molybdenum alloys.

Increasing the chromium and iron contents of the 15 per cent
molybdenum alloys did not bring about pronounced strengthening effects.
In fact, there was a slight weakening of the alloys upon increasing the
iron content fram 4 to 10 per cent at a constant chromium concentration.
An explanation based upon the finer grain size of the high-iron alloys
does not follow since the cause of the finer grain size was attributed
to an increase in quantity of M C-type carbides in the alloys; the
latter would be expected to over-ride the influence of grain size upon
the creep-rupture behavior. The exact cause of the strength differences

noted is not clear, therefore, from the data which have been obtained.

20 Per Cent Molybdenum Alloys with 0.5 Per Cent Aluminum - 0.5 Per
Cent Manganese - 0.06 Per Cent Carbon and Varying Percentages of
Chromium and Iron

Hot-rolling of the 20 per cent molybdenum alloys was less
successful than for the lower molybdenum-content alloys. As a result,
creep-rupture specimens could be prepared from only three of the four
alloys listed in Table VI where a summary of the creep-rupture resuits
is presented. These data are plotted in bar-graph form in Figure 27.
As in the case of the 10 and 15 per cent molybdenum alioys of this
series, an attempt was made to interpret the data in terms of the
variables which could be influencing creep-rupture behavior.

The solution-annealed grain size of this group of alloys was
smaller than that of the 10 and 15 per cent molybdenum alloys and was
attributed to the increase in the quantity of M C-type carbides present
in the microstructure. A very slight variation in grain size between
the individual alloys was alsc noted as shown in Table VI.

Hardness and metallographic studies were conducted on all four
alloys of this group after aging at 1500°F. Table VII shows the range
and average hardness of the various coupons of each alloy after aging;
the average hardnesses are shown graphically in Figure 28.

The aging response of these alloys showed evidence that a phase
boundary had been crossed by the 10 per cent iron alloys at both
chromium concentrations. It should be mentioned, however, that both
10 per cent iron alloys contained 7 per cent chromium according to the

reported analyses. The precipitation of the additional phase in these

alloys brought about a steady increase in hardness with aging time at
1500°F which could be correlated with an increase in grain-boundary
precipitate. The hardness data for the low-itron alloys at the two
chromium contents agreed well with the trend previously noted, in that
the response to carbide aging was only slight due to the tie-up of
carbon in the M C-type carbides which did not dissolve during the
solution-annealing treatment. Consequently, the difference between the
solution-annealed hardness of these two alloys and their peak hardness
upon aging was less than that noted for the 15 per cent molybdenum
alloys. The general hardness level of the 20 per cent molybdenum alloys
was greater than for the lower molybdenum alloys.

The course of aging of alloy VI-59 (20 Mo - 7 Cr - 4 Fe -
0.5 AL ~ 0.5 Mn - 0.06 C ~- balance Ni) at 1500°F 1s illustrated in
Figure 29. A grain-boundary reaction had occurred after five hours,
and discrete grain-boundary particles were observed after 25 to 1000
hours, Figure 30 shows there was little effect of stress on the micro-
structure of this alloy. The solution-annealed and aged microstructures
developed by alloy VI-60 (20 Mo = 7 Cr - 10 Fe - 0,5 Al - 0,5 Mn -
0,06 C ~ balance Ni) are illustrated in Figure 31. Precipitation of an
additional grain-boundary phase was observed with increasing aging time.
Figure 32 more clearly shows this phase as it developed in the gage
length of a creep-rupture specimen of alloy VI-58 (20 Mo - 5 Cr -
10 Fe - 0.5 AL - 0.5 Mn - 0,06 C ~ balance Ni).

If the average time, i.e., average of the two tests per alloy,

to 1 per cent strain was used as a criterion for determining the

strength of the alloys in which only carbide precipitation was present,
there was little difference between the 20 per cent molybdenum alloys
and the corresponding 15 per cent molybdenum alloys. However, the
average times to strains greater than 1 per cent showed the 20 per cent
molybdenum alloys to be stronger.

Comparing the data between the individual 20 per cent molybdenum
alloys, there was little difference in the strengths of alloys VI-59
and VI-57. It was intended that alloy VI-59 represent a 2 per cent
Increase in the nominal chromium content. The analyzed compositions of
these two alloys, however, showed the higher chromium alloy to contain
approximately 3 per cent less molybdenum. The fact that no difference
in the amount of precipitate was noted within the two materials indi-
cated the creep strength to be more dependent upon structure than the
variation in molybdenum and chromium contents.

It was interesting to note the behavior of the 10 per cent iron
alloy, VI-58, in creep~rupture. Average times for strains up to 1 per
cent were less for this alloy than either of the alloys VI=57 or VI-59,
However, the times required for strains between 2 and 5 per cent were
comparable for all three alloys. For greater amounts of strain the
greater strength of alloy VI-58 was evident by the progressively
longer times for a given strain. The rupture life of alloy VT-58 was
significantly longer. This behavior was probably associated with the
slightly finer grain size of alloy VI-58 compared with that of the
other two alloys coupled with instabilities resulting from the pre-

cipitation of the non-carbide grain-boundary phase. These factors

"High-Purity"” Alloys

Because the carbon intentionally added to the alloys of series I
was very effective in introducing into these materials several of the
factors which affect creep-rupture behavior, strengthening effects
attributable to chramium and/or iron could not be established from the
data with any degree of certainty. Therefore, the alloys of series II
were prepared with no intentional carbon addition. The alloys were
intended to show the influence of increasing amounts of chromium upon
the strength of a 15 Mo - balance Ni binary alloy, and the influence of
increasing amounts of iran upon the strength of a 15 Mo - 7 Cr -~ balance
. N1 ternary alloy.

The creep-rupture data obtained on the alloys of series II are
summarized in Table VIII. Considering the influence of chramium, it
would be inferred fram the bar-graph of creep-rupture results shown in
Figure 33 that more than 3 per cent chromium in a 15 Mo = balance Ni
binary alloy brought about an increase in strength. Unfortunately, it
was necessary to consider also the effects of grain-size variations and
a precipitation reaction in the alloys containing 5 per cent or more of
chromium.

Grain-size measurements tabulated in Table VIII made on the
creep=rupture specimens of the straight chromium-bearing alloys showed
a sharp decrease in grain size when they contained 5 per cent or more

of chromium. Apparently, the stress-relieving treatment at 1600°F for

one-half hour given all the materials prior tc machining creep-rupture
specimens precipitated the grain=boundary phase which, until effec-
tively dissolved, retarded grain growth in the specimens during the
solution-annealing treatment.

The range and average hardness of the chroamium-bearing ternary
alloys after a solution-annealing treatment as well as after aging
100 hours at 1500°F are shown in Table IX. The average hardness data
are presented in bar-graph form in Figure 34. Increasing the chromium
content caused an increase in hardness of the ternary alloys, although
it should be remembered that the hardness measurements included a
grain-size variable as well as a composition variable. The slight
increase in hardness as a result of the 1500°F aging treatment in the
alloys containing 5 per cent or more of chromium could be correlated
with the precipitation which occurred in these alloys.

Figures 35, 36, and 37 show the microstructure of alloy VI=-90
(15 Mo - balance Ni) after having been solution-ennealed, aged 100 hours
at 1500°F, and creep-rupture tested at 1500°F. In all cases the struc-
ture is that of a solid-solution alloy. These microstructures were also
representative of alloy VI-89 (15 Mo - 3 Cr - balance Ni) under the same

containing 5, 7, and 10 per cent chromium as a result of aging or
creep-rupture testing at 1500°F.

Because of the incopsistencies in the grain sizes and the amount
of grain-boundary precipitate in this group of alloys, a comparison of
their relative strengths could at best be made between the O and 3 per
cent chromium alloys, and between the 5, 7, and 10 per cent chromium
alloys. With this scheme of evaluation, it was concluded that a 3 per
cent chromium addition added nothing to the strength of the binary base
composition. Similarly, only a slight increase in strength was realized
by increasing the chromium content from 5 to 7 per cent; but an increase
to 10 per cent chromium showed a more significant strengthening effect,
particularly for the time required to reach a strain of 2 per cent or
more.

The creep-rupture data obtained on the alloys prepared to show
the influence of increasing amounts of iron upon the strength of a
15 Mo = 7 Cr - balance Ni ternary composition are plotted in Figure 41,
Interpretation of the data was again complicated by the necessity of
considering grain size and precipitation variables in addition to
composition.

Grain-size measurements made on a creep=rupture specimen of each
of the iron-bearing alloys are tabulated in Table VIII. The variation
noted has been attributed to the difference in the amount of precipi-
tation which occurred in these alloys during the stress-relieving
treatment prior to machining the creep-rupture specimens. It will be

shown that the volume of grain-boundary particles precipitated at 1500°F

in the alloy of lowest iron content was less than that found in the
7 and 10 per cent iron alloys.

The range and average hardness of the alloys after solution -
annealing at 2100°F and after aging 100 hours at 1500°F are shown in
Table IX. The average hardness data have.been plotted in bar-graph
form in Figure 34. There was no significant trend in hardness as a
function of increasing iron content; the slight rise in hardness of
each alloy after aging 100 hours at 1500°F has been attributed to the
grain-boundary precipitation which took place in the alloys.

Microstructures developed by alloy VT-91 (15 Mo - 7 Cr - 4 Fe -
balance Ni, chemical analysis indicated 5 Cr and 2 Fe) after having been
solution-annealed, aged 100 hours at 1500°F, and creep-rupture tested at
1500°F are shown in Figures 42, 43, and 44. Although a small quantity
-of grain-boundary precipitate was observed in the aged coupon, virtu-
ally none was found in the creep-rupture specimen.

The 7 and. 10 per cent iron alloys precipitated a larger amount
of the grain-boundary phase which was observed in both the 100-hour
aged specimens and the creep-rupture specimens. This is evident when
Figures 45, 46, and 47, microstructures of alloy Vr-92 (15 Mo - 7 Cr -
10 Fe - balance Ni) are compared with the previous three figures. The
amount of grain-boundary precipitate observed In these alloys could be
correlated with their carbon analyses. Both the 7 and 10 per cent iron
alloys contained approximately twice the amount of carbon as the 4 per

cent iron alloy.

The presence of other variables in addition to camposition
caused difficulty in attempting to determine the influence of iron upon
the strength of the alloys. For example, camparing the strength of the
ternary base camposition, VI-87, with that of the 4 per cent iron alloy,
VI-91, it was found that both materials were comparable in strength.
However, such a compariscn necessitated ar accounting not only for the
difference in composition, but also for the differences in grain size
and amount of precipitation present in the materials. It was, then, a
summation of the variables affecting creep-rupture behavior which
equalized the strength of the alloys.

It was possible to make a direct comparison of the effect of
increasing iron content between the alloys containing 7 and 10 per cent
iron. The fact that no increase in strength was realized by the further
increase of 3 per cent iron showed this element to have an insignifi-

cant effect as a solid-solution strengthener.

DECARBURIZATION STUDIES

A comparison of the microstructures of the 15 per cent molyb-
denum alloys with and without an intentional carbon addition left little
doubt that carbides accounted for the bulk of second phase material
observed in these alloys, since the quantity present was related to the
carbon content. Also, the fact that the nickel-molybdenum-chromium
ternary compositions of series IT were located well within the alpha

phase boundaries of the 1508°F section of this system proposed by

 
-83-

Lundy and Stansbury indicated that the precipitates found at 1500°F in

these alloys were carbides. On the other hand, the observed increase
in the amount of precipitated particles with increasing percentages of
iron added to the 15 per cent molybdenum - 7 per cent chromium -
balance nickel alloy warranted more conclusive phase identification in
the iron-bearing alloys of series II. It has already been shown by
creep-rupture tests, hardness studies, and metallographic means that
precipitation of a phase other than a carbide occurred in the 20 per
cent molybdenum alloys of series I when the iron content was increased
from 4 to 10 per cent. Evidence was therefore needed to establish
whether iron was having this same influence upon the 15 per cent
molybdenum alloys.

As indicated in Chapter IV, the decarburization studies were
conducted on selected series II compositions as well as on several
alloys of series I to observe the disappearance of carbide phases,
thereby affording a method of phase identification. The decarburi-
zation treatment consisted of heat-treating the alloys in a hydrogen
atmosphere for 100 hours at 2200°F. An additional aging treatment for
100 hours at 1500°F was then given the alloys in order that a comparison
could be made between these microstructures and those obtained after
the conventional aging treatment at 1500°F.

Comparative carbon analyses of the alloys before and after
decarburization are shown in Table X. It 1s apparent that this treat-
ment effectively reduced the carbon content to 0.010 — 0.016 per cent.

Typical microstructures are illustrated in Figures 48 through 52. All

alloys were found to be vold of precipitated particles with the
exception of alloy VIT=-58 which retained a grain-boundary phase. These
results present evidence that within the experimental conditions of this
investigation, all phases in excess of the matrix could be attributed to
carbide particles with the exception of an additional phase found in
alloys VIT-58 and VT-60, both of which were 20 per cent molybdenum alloys

of series I with 10 per cent iron.

CHAPTER VI
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Based upon the experimental results of the present investigation,

the following conclusions and recommendations can be stated:

Conclusions

1. From the standpoint of their creep-rupture strength at 1500°F
and 10,000 psi, it was possible to conveniently group the molybdenum-
chromium-iron-nickel base alloys containing a nominal content of 0.5
per cent aluminum - 0.5 per cent manganese - 0.06 per cent carbon
according to the three concentrations of molybdenum studied: 10, 15,
and 20 per cent.

2. The principal factors affecting the strength of the alloys
within these groups were: solid-solution elements, aging reactions,
the presence of MC-type carbides in the microstructures, and grain
size.

3. It could be concluded from the analyses and microstructures
of these alloys that the relative strength contribution of each factor
varied between the individual groups.

4, The combined effects of solid-solution strengthening by
molybdenum and the increase in quantity of dispersed MC-type carbides
which this element promoted in the annealed materials were the pre-
dominant factors which progressively increased the strength of the

alloys grouped by molybdenum content. The only exception noted was in

 
-90-

the case of the 20 per cent molybdenum - 7 per cent chromium - 10 per
cent iron alloy which precipitated a non-carbide phase as a consequence
of crossing a new phase boundary. The presence of this phase in the
microstructure contributed noticeably to creep-rupture strength in the
later stages of test.

5. The contribution of chromium and iron to the strength of the
alloys within the individual groups could not be established with
certainty due to simultaneous variations in other factors affecting
creep-rupture behavior.

6. Because of the scatter.in rupture life between alloys of a
group, this was not a good criterion for strength. On the other hand,
times to specified amounts of strain preceding rupture appeared more
meaningful for correlative interpretation of the data.

7. Although the studies conducted upon the "high-purity" nickel-
molybdenum-chromium ternary alloys with 15 per cent molybdenum were com-
plicated. by carbide precipitation and grain-size variations, the data
indicated the strengthening influence of chromium to be significant in
the range of 5 to 10 per cent, but most pronounced when 10 per cent was
present. The strengthening influence of iron was interpreted as being
insignificant when amounts up to 10 per cent were added to a 15 per cent
molybdenum - 7 per cent chromium - balance nickel base.

8. A general consideration of all data obtained fram this
investigation favorably supports the composition specification placed
upon the alloy INOR-8. An increase in the presently specified

molybdenum range for thls elloy, yet keeping within the solubility

 
-91-

limits, would be made at the expense of fabricability and would result
in only slight gain in strength as shown by this work. Although the
solid-solution strength contribution of chromium is of less signifi-
cance than the contribution of molybdenum and dispersed carbide
particles, chramium is necessary at the specified concentration to
impart oxidation resistance. Iron at the specified concentration is in-
significant as a solid-solution strengthener, but the introduction of
this element into the alloy through the use of ferro-alloy additions

is not objectionable.

Recommendations

1. Future attempts to determine the solid-solution strengthening
influence of specific elements in an alloy should be preceded by a
careful consideration of methods to isolate the variable(s) of interest.
Of particular importance, as shown by this work, is the elimination of
carbon from alloys containing strong carbide formers. Purification of
the alloys by a prior decarburization treatment, similar to that
described here, would be invaluable.

2. It would be of interest to determine the chemical camposition
of the carbide phase(s) which were present in the alloys studied for
this investigation.

3. For advancing the technology of the alloy INOR-8, the
influence of heat treatment upon creep-rupture behavior should be

investigated.

APPENDIX
CREEP-RUPTURE TESTING APPARATUS

Typlcal creep frames used in the Mechanical Properties
Laboratory of the ORNL Metallurgy Division for testing in gaseous
environments are shown in Figure 53. The main component of a creep
frame of this type is a leaktight test chamber which can be heated uni-
formly to the desired test temperature and in which strain and tempera-
ture measurements can be made.on a stressed test specimen. The chamber,
1tself, consists of a metal tube, water-jacketed on the ends to allow
sufficient cooling for the brass bellows and for the rubber O-rings
utilized as seals. Side ports are provided to allow for optical
measurement of the specimen extension. The heating elements are wound
around the tube in such a way as to compensate for the heat losses at
the ends and at the side ports. External shunts are provided to allow
for adjustment of vertical. temperature gradients. Pull rods connected
to and extending through the two bellows make it possible to introduce
a load on the specimen inside the chamber. With the bottom pull rod
anchored in place, the specimen can be stressed by application of a
load to the top bellows through a lever arm and a welght-pan system.

Four thermocuuples are wired to the specimen, two at either end
of the specimen gage length, and the leads are brought out of the test
chamber through rubber stoppers to a junction box. One thermocouple is
used for temperature control with the use of a Leeds and Northrup

duration-ad just-type controller (DAT) and a Speedamax recorder.

Temperature readings from each of the four thermocouples are made with
a multi-point precision indicator.

The extension of specimens during creep is measured optically by
means of a pair of dovetailed platinum alloy strips which are spot-
welded over the gage length. The strips are referenced so that measure-
ments can be made with a microscope through the test chamber side ports.
This optical method of measuring extensions is precise to approximately
+ 0.0003 inch. Figure 54 shows a specimen connected to the top bellows,
with the platinum extensometer and thermocouples in place ready for
assembly in the test chamber. Figure 55 is a view of the scribed plati-
num extensameter fram which the extension measurements are made. A
dial gage attached to the pull rod outside the test chamber acts as a

rough check on the micrometer microscope readings.
