LIQUID-VAPOR EQUILIBRIA IN LiF-BeF, AND LiF-BeF,-ThF, SYSTEMS

F. J. Smith, L. M. Ferris, and C. T. Thompson

ABSTRACT

1

Liquid-vapor equilibrium data for several LiF-BeF, and LiF-BeFp-
ThF, systems were obtained by the transpiration method over the tem-
perature range of 900 to 1050°C. Relative volatilities, effective
activity coefficients, and apparent partial pressures are tabulated for
the major components, as well as for solutes such as UF, ZrFy GsF,
RbF, and some rare-earth fluorides. The values are in reasonable a=
greement with those reported in the literature. Results of this study
show that distillation may not be feasible as a primary separations
method in the processing of single-fluid MSBR fuels.

1. INTRODUCTION

To be an efficient breeder, a molten-salt reactor must be close-coupled to a
chemical processing facility to provide for the continuous removal of protactinium,
fission products, and corrosion products from the system. The initial molten-salt
breeder reactor (MSBR) concepts "2 were based on the use of two fluids: a fuel
salt composed of LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) containing about 0.3 mole % UF, and
a blanket salt having the approximate composition LiF-BeF,-ThF , (73-2-25 mole %).
Recently,” however, emphasis has been centered on a single-fluid MSBR that would
utilize a salt such as LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, (72-16-12-0.3 mole %). Considerable

effort was expended on the development of a fluorination-distillation method 7
for the processing of the fuel salt from.a two-fluid MSBR. Fluorination was selected
as the method for removing the uranium from the salt as UF, and distillation was
proposed as the means for separating the rare-earth fission products from the bulk
“of the LiF-BeF,

the vapor sample indicated that the rare-earth separation factors were about 100.

More recent experiments by Cantor, 10 who used the transpiration method, and by

 
 

Hightower and McNeese, who used an equilibrium still, demonstrated that dis-
tillation is possible and reported rare-earth separation factors of about 1000. Prior
to the present study, no experiments were conducted with LiF-BeF,-ThF 4 systems;
hence, the applicability of distillation to the processing of single-fluid MSBR fuels

could not be properly assessed.

This report summarizes the results of experiments in which the transpiration
method of obtaining liquid-vapor equilibrium data was used in the temperature range
of 900 to 1050°C. These experiments had three objectives: (1) to corroborate data
obtained by the equilibrium still technique with two-fluid MSBR fuel salt, (2) to
determine relative volatilities of other components of interest in two-fluid MSBR
processing, and (3) to obtain sufficient data on LiF-BeF,~ThF, systems to allow a
preliminary evaluation of the applicability of distillation in the processing of single-

fluid MSBR fuel.

2. EXPERIMENTAL

In using the transpiration method with molten salts, an inert (carrier) gas is
passed over a molten salt (becoming saturated with the vapor in equilibrium with it),
through a condenser where the salt vapors are deposited and collected, and, finally,
through a Wet Test Meter where the total volume of inert gas used is determined.

After the vapors have transpired for a known period of time at a given temperature,

O

o

 
 

 

 

the condenser is removed and the salt contained within is dissolved. Analyses of
the solution, along with the pressure of the system and the volume of inert gas used,
provide the information necessary for calculating apparent partial pressures of the

components of the system.

The transpiration apparatus, shown schematically in Fig. 1, closely resembles
that used by Sense etal.'2 and Cantor. 13 The basic components consisted of a
36-in.-long alumina tube contained in a 16-in.-long Marshall furnace. A nickel
liner was placed inside the alumina tube to protect the alumina from corrosion by the
fluoride vapors and to help "flatten" the temperature profile. The temperature profile
of the Marshall furnace was adjusted by the use of shunts until the hottest region of
the furnace was located exactly in the center and the maximum temperature variation
(at 1000°C) over the length of the nickel boat (used to contain the salt sample) was
5°C. The furnace temperature was controlled by a Wheelco "Capacitrol™ time-
proportional controller and a Chromel-Alumel thermocouple. The temperatures of the
melt and vapor were measured by means of Chromel-Alumel thermocouples and a Brown

recorder.

Salt samples (about 100 g) of the desired composition were initially treated, in
graphite containers, with HF- H, mixtures at 850 to 900°C to remove oxide im-
purities; residual HF and H, were stripped from the salt with high-purity argon.
After being cooled to room temperature, each salt ingot was transferred (under argon)
to the nickel boat, which was placed in the center of the Marshall furnace. The
transpiration apparatus was heated (with argon flowing slowly) to the desired tem-
perature. Then a condenser was inserted into the system, and transpired vapors were

collected over a predetermined length of time.

Each condenser (made of 1/4-in.-diam nickel tubing) had a 1/32-in.~diam hole
in the end that was in contact with the vapor phase above the salt sample. The
carrier gas was high-purity argon that had been further purified by passage through
a Molecular Sieve trap to remove water and through a heated (450°C) trap filled
with metallic copper to remove oxygen. Removal and replacement of the condensers

could be accomplished while the system remained at temperature; thus duplicate

samples at a given temperature and/or a series of samples at different temperatures
could be obtained using a single batch of salt. After a condenser was removed, its
exterior was polished to remove surface contamination. The condenser was then
cut into sections, and the salt contained within was recovered by leaching the
sections with 1 N H,SO,,. Aliquots of the leachate were submitted for the desired

analyses.

Apparent partial pressures were calculated from the following expression:

 

N
PAT NF ye TM
A B A
where

Py = the apparent partial pressure of species A,

P = the total pressure of the vaporized salt and carrier gas,
Ny, = total moles of species A collected in the condenser, and

M = total moles of carrier gas passed through the system.

This expression was derived by assuming that the behavior of each gas was ideal

and that Dalton's law of partial pressures was applicable.

The transpiration method gives no direct information about the molecular for-
mulas of the vapor species or about the total vapor pressure of the system. Therefore,
it was assumed that each species existed as the monomer in the vapor phase. In
using this method, the gas flow rate must be carefully controlled. If it is too high
(i.e., greater than the rate at which evaporation occurs at the liquid surface), the
carrier gas will not become saturated with vapor and the measured value of the
vapor pressure will be low. If it is too low, thermal diffusion effects in the vapor
phase will make the calculated value of Pa too large. For the experimental ap-
poratus described above, the measured vapor pressure of a typical salt was found to
be independent of the argon flow rate in the range of 15 to 50 cc (STP)/min. There-
fore, no correction was needed for diffusion or kinetic effects. Under the conditions
used, no change in the composition of the liquid phase was detected during the course

of an experiment.

vapor phase, the partial pressures of LiF, BeF,, and solute fluorides were calculated
by assuming that only monomers existed in the vapor. [In each experiment, the

apparent partial pressures, P A could be described adequately by the linear expression
log Py (mm of Hg) = a - b/T(°K) ,

in which a and b were constants over the temperature range investigated, 900 to

1050°C. Typical plots of log P vs 1/T are shown in Figs. 2 and 3.

Other workers have expressed their vapor-liquid equilibrium data in terms of

relative volatility, which is defined by:

Ya/Yg
CAB” xp/%p !

where a, is the relative volatility of component A with respect to component B,

y is the le fraction of the designated component in the vapor phase, and x is the
mole fraction in the liquid phase. The relative volatilities of Bef, (with respect to
LiF) obtained in our experiments with LiF-BeF., binary systems are in reasonable
agreement with those reported by Cantor, 10 who also used the transpiration method.
For example, Cantor obtained values of 4.28 for LiF-BeF,, (85-15 mole %) at 1000°C
and 3.75 for LiF-BeF, (90-10 mole %); the corresponding values from the present
study were about 3.8 and 3.77 (Table 1). Our value obtained with LiF-BeF, (90-10
mole %) is somewhat lower than the average value of 4.71 reported by Hightower

and McNeese, | who used an equilibrium still method, and is higher than our values
obtained when the salt contained small amounts of RbF, CsF, ZF, (Table 1). This

scatter in values is not surprising, however, because small variations in the composition

of the liquid and/or vapor cause large changes in the relative volatility value. For

very close to those calculated by assuming ideal solution behavior (Raoult's law;
Y=1). The results of the study presented in this report show that RbF and CsF also
behave almost ideally; their activity coefficients are near unity (Table 1). Uranium
tetrafluoride and ZF yy on the other hand, do not behave ideally in solution; activity
coefficients for these solutes were only 1074 to 1072 (Table 1). The vapor pressures,

at 1000°C, of the pure fluorides of interest are given in the following table:

of single-fluid MSBR fuels. The data are summarized in Table 2. A typical partial-

1.5 x 10°. Data for the system LiF-BeF,-ThF ,~CsF-RbF (33.0-0.66-63.1-1.36-
1.98 mole %) yielded relative volatilities of about 100, 0.65, 3.7, and 1.0 for
BeF,, ThF 4 CsF, and RbF, respectively, at 1000°C. The total pressure predicted
for this system ot 1000°C is less than 0.05 mm Hg. In contrast to the observation
made with LiF-BeF,, systems, the behavior of CsF and RbF was far from ideal. The
effective activity coefficients for these two solutes were 3 x 103 and 8 x 1073,
respectively. This marked departure from ideality is probably due to complexation
of the alkali-metal fluorides with ThF ,. (Note that the ThF ,/LiF mole ratio in
this salt was rather high.) In another experiment at 1000°C with LiF-BeF,~ThF ,-
CsF-RbF (68-20-12-0.13-0.08 mole %), a salt having a much lower ThF ,/LiF mole
ratio, both CsF and RbF behaved much more ideally; the effective activity coef-
ficients were 1.6 and 17, respectively. The corresponding relative volatilities
(with respect to LiF) were 107 and 119. Data from a run with LiF-BeF ,-ThF -EuF
(42.4-0.06-51.8-5.8 mole %) yielded a relative volatility of about 9 x 1073 for

EuFg at 1000°C.

4. CONCLUSIONS

Measurements made with three different LiF-BeF, solutions indicated that a melt
having the approximate composition LiF-BeF, (90-10 mole %) will, at 1000°C, be
in equilibrium with vapor having the composition LiF-BeF,, (66-34 mole %). The
latter composition is that desired for the fuel salt for a two-fluid MSBR. The re-
sults of this study show that recovery of the UF 4 and most of the LiF and BeF,, from
the fuel salt of a two-fluid MSBR, leaving fission products such as the rare earths
in the still-pot bottoms, is not possible in a single-stage distillation system because
the volatility of the UF is foo low. The fluorides of the fission products cesium,
zirconium, and rubidium have high relative volatilities, and would therefore con-

centrate in the distillate with the LiF and BeF,. Although the relative volatilities

>
of the various components are different, a complicated multistage distillation system

would be required to effect the desired separations. Thus, these results support the

original conclusion™ that distillation is best applied to the processing of two-fluid

MSBR fuel salt after the uranium has been removed by fluorination.

The few results obtained with LiF -BeF,-ThF 4 systems showed that the volatilities
of both the rare-earth fluorides and ThF, are low, even at 1000°C. It is possible
that the rare-earth-thorium separation required in the processing of single-fluid MSBR
fuels could be achieved by distillation; however, the results of this work indicate
that the temperature required to achieve adequate distillation rates would have to be
at least 1200°C. Thus, determination of relative volatilities for the rare-earth
fluorides and ThF 4 at temperatures above 1000°C will be required in order to assess
the feasibility of utilizing distillation in the processing of single-fluid MSBR fuels.
