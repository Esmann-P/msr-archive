OF ALUMINUM-MATRIX NUCLEAR FUEL ELEMENTS

R. EB. Thoma, B. J. Sturm, E. H. Guinn

ABSTRACT

The results of a search for moliten-salt solvents for use
in fluoride volatility processing of aluminum-matrix fuel ele-
ments are presented. The solubility of aluminum fluoride in
various mixtures of fluorides was determined in order to esti-
mate the feasibility and cost of processing methods. Sufficient
data were accumulated to construct equilibrium phase diagrams
of the solution systems, IiF-NaF-AlFj3, LiF-KF-Al¥3, LiF~K3AlFe-
MF, (where MF, is CaF, Sr¥a, or nF), and KF-ZrFs;-AlF3. New
and revised phase diagrams were determined for the limiting
binary systems of the alkali fluorides with AlF3 by use of a
new visual method for determining the occurrence of liquidus
transitions. This method provided several advantages not
available in classical methods of obtaining liquidus data.

For example, it was observed for the first time that immisci-
ble liquids are formed at high temperatures in AlFa3-based
systems. The temperatures at which such liquids form are,
however, higher than is feasible for adoption in most current
chemical technologies. Of the various materials evaluated as
solvents for the volatility process, the greatest potential
for application was displayed by the XF-ZrF4;-AlF3 system.
High solubility and good dissolution rates are afforded by
the inexpensive solvent salt KaZrFs. At operating tempera-
tures, approximately 600°C, the AlF3 capacity of the solvent
is in excess of 25 mole %.

INTRODUCTION

Development of the fluoride volatility process is sought as a useful
and effective alternative to conventional aqueous processing for recovery
of uranium from spent nuclear fuels. The process depends on dissolving
fuel elements in a suitable molten fluoride solvent by passage of HF gas
followed by fluorination of the resulting melt to volatilize uranium as

UFg. © The UFg is purified by selective sorption on solid NaF or other
fluorides. Molten~salt fluoride volatility processing of nuclear Tuels
offers advantages not available with other chemical reprocessing methods:
(1) the process is simple,” requiring only a hydrofluorination step and
a fluorination step instead of the many steps--dejacketing, acid dissolu-~
tion, precipitation, filtration,” ate. ~~characteristic of the usual
aqueous procedures; (2) the uranium is recovered as UFg, the form required
for isolope separation,’ and (3) disposal is made of essentially all fis-
gion products as water-insoluble solids. It is also one of the Tew methods
=

that can be used for processing certain ceramic fuels.’

The process has been previously applied successfully to zirconium-

1,8,9

matrix fuels. Currently, it is considered for alwminum-matrix fuels

10,11 and because of the need

because of thelr use in numercus reactors
anticipated for processing large guantities of these fuels.
One of the most important aspects of volatility process development
in adapting the process to a particular kind of fuel element is the selec-
tion of a suitable molten~salt solvent into which to pass the HF gas during
dissolution. A preliminary survey of prospective AlFj3 solvents reported
by Boles and Thoma 2 showed that a BeF;~LiF solvent provides moderately
good solubility for Al¥js3, but, because of expense and toxicity, an alter-
native solvent system is preferred. They considered KF-Zrf, solvents to
be of potential use. The preliminary data obtained at that time were too
limited for a critical selection of optimal selvents for use in volatility
processing. Accordingly, a more intensive search for solvents was initi-
ated using newer methods which permit rapid accumilation of large numbers
of ligquid~sclid transition data.
Desirable characteristics of the solvent for the process include the
following:
1. Tow cost,
. ILiquidus temperatures below 600°C.
. Substantial solubility of AlFa3 at 500 to 600°C.

2
3
4. Low vapor pressure.
5. low viscosity.

. Noncorrosive with respect to the INOR-8 container.
In reprocessing aluminum-matrix fuel elements, the temperature must
be kept below the melting point of aluminum (6000¢)13 to avoid forming
liquid metal, which is corrosive to the container alloy, TNOR-8. The sus-
ceptibility of INOR~& to corrosion by liguid aluminum is offset by its
excellent structural properties at high temperatures and its resistance
to corrosion by fluorine and HF. It is desirable to prevent the maximum
operating temperature from exceeding a limit of at least 50°C lower than
the melting point of aluminum; consequently, 600°C has been tentatively
chosen as the maximum temperature for the process. The economic feasibile
ity of the process is highly dependent upon the cost of the solvent.
Solvents in which the saturating concentrations for AlFa are as low as
8 mole % may be useful if the solvent costs less than 50 cents a pound.
Ir, however, higher-priced solvent components are required in order to
obtain the desirable solvent characteristics, the economic feasibility

of the process may then require higher saturating concentrations of AlFj3.

Choice of Constituent Fluorides as AlF3 Solvents

 

The choice of possible solvent constituents can be rapidly narrowed
to one group: cheap fluorides which are stable in the presence of gaseous
HF and fluorine. Cationic constituents should either have only one va~-
lence state as the fluoride, or both the lower fluoride, existing during
dissolution, and the higher fluoride, formed during fluorination, should
be noncorrosive, possess sufficiently low vapor pressure, and have suit-
able melting characteristics for use in the solvent.

Previous to the ORNL work cn the volatility process there was little
published information concerning the attack of aluminum metal by molten
fluorides, and none regarding the relationship of HF or other dissolved
oxidant gases to this attack. It is known that aluminum reacts with molten
alkali metal fluorides and with molten cryolite to form free alkali metal
and the appropriate fluoroaluminate. + The metal also reacts with molten
KaThFg, forming a Th-Al alloy and a potassium fluoroaluminate. Aluminum
metal reacts with solid CeFs at 1000°C to form cerium metal and AlFj3.

With KaTiFe¢, aluminum reacts to form KpAlFg, free titanium metal, and an
opaque phase believed to be a complex of TiF3. 12 Published free-energy

valuesl® favor the formation of TiFs3 by the reaction:
Al + Fi¥, = 3TiF3 + AlFs .

The Tree~energy values suggest thal the alkali metal fluorides ThFg, Cefs,
AlFa, and TiFy may serve as potential solvent constituents. Molten 3nkFs
and NiizHF, both attack aluminum metait "+o but have disadvantages which
preclude their use as potential volatility solvents. The former is very
corrosive to structural metals; the latter presents a vapor problem

and decomposes during fluorination. Aluminum reacts vigorously when heated
with fluorides of Ni, Co, Fe, or 0s.1% Mumimm reacts with molten alkali
metal fluorcborates and fluorosilicates to form, respectively, aluminum
boride and silicon or silicides. The use of fluoroborates and fluorosili-
cates in the volatility process presumably should be avoided because
borides and silicides are so inert that they are likely to remain in the
processing solvent in the form of an annoying sludge.

Relatively few fluorides possess the properties required for their
use as major constituents of a solvent. Fluorides of nonmetals, semimetals,
inert gases, and the platinum metals either have too high a vapor pressure
or are too corrosive to be considered. (See Table 1 for boiling points.)
These objections apply as well to fluorides of Cu, Mo, Ag, W, Au, Hg, Nb,
Ta, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Tl, Pb, and Sn. Scarcity would eliminate consideration
of most rare earths, all transuranium elements, also Se, Y, Re, Hf, Te,

Fr, Ra, Ac, and Pa. Fluorides of Zn, Ga, In, and Cd do not qualify because
their reduction by aluminum would form corrosive liquid metal. Uranium
fluoride of natural isotopic composition is objectionable because its use
would alter the isotopic composition of the fuel being processed. Thus

the list of possible solvent constituents is therefore narrowed to the

following fluorides:

LiF BeF» AlF3 TiFg FeF»
NaF MgFs LaF; ZrFs NiFo
KF Cala CeFs Thi,

Eb¥ Sri

Cs¥F BaF,

Most of the fluorides in this group are suitable only as minor comstitu~
ents of the solvent for the following reasons:

1. RbF, Cs¥, IaF3, and ThFs are moderately expensive.
nN

2. Fel and NiFz in high concentrations may present corrosion
problems during fluorination.

3. MgFp, CaFa, SrFa, BaF2, and CeF3 have very high melting
points (see Table 1).

4, TiF4 in high concentrations may exert somewhat excessive
vapor pressure.
These compounds were, therefore, considered not as major solvent constit-
uents but merely as possible additives for possibly depressing the liquidus
of a promising solvent. The remaining six compounds--LiF, NaF, KF, Bela,
AF3, and ZrFi--were given the principal consideration as solvent compo-

nents.

Survey of Potential Solvent Systems

 

Except for Be¥F,, which is too viscous, none of the promising fluoride
constituents individually has the necessary low melting point (below 600°C)
to be used directly as the solvent (see Table 1). A number of binary mix-
tures of these fluorides do, however, form adequately low melting eutectics
(see Table 2). The only AlF3 binary system which provides sufficiently
low melting mixtures for possible use in the process is the KF-Al¥3 sys-
tem; its capacity for additional AlFj3 at the process temperature is,
however, limited to about 5 mole %, too low for process use.

In order to find lowv-melting solvent systems suitable for the proce
ess, phase relationships were studied in the ternary systems formed by
dissolving AlF3 in a molten binary solvent. Little concern was given to
more complex solvent systems because the study of polycomponent systems
delineating the phase reactions occurring as AlFj dissolves in such sol-
vents iz too involved to permit adequate characterization in a reasonable
length of time. In addition, the probability of diagnosing the cause of
off-performance difficulties in engineering tests by identification of
crystallized solids is remote for multicomponent salt systems unless de
tailed investigation of the phase behavior has been made. Accordingly,
when a fourth component was considered, it was usually only as a minor
addition to a promising ternary system, e.g., A~B~AlF3, included in order
to lower the liquidus temperatures enough to meet process requirements.

Although the fluoride volatility process is intended for reprocessing
oN

fuels containing both uranium and aluminum, consideration was given only
to the solubility of the resulting Al¥Fiz in evaluating a solvent. The
uranium content of these fuels, generally less than 1 at. %, yields too
low a UF4 concentration in the solvent to affect the liquidus temperature

significantly.

PROCEDURES

The initial phase studies 2740 of the solvent systems were performed
primarily by classical procedures which proved to be generally inadequate
for systems containing AlFi3, Because AlF:z and alkali metal fluorocalumi-
nates are frequently not microscopically distinguishable from each other,
these systems were not amenable to studies employing the guenching tech-
nigus. Alsc; the thermal change at the liguidus temperature was often
too small to be readily detected by thermal analysis. Even when a thermal
change was detected; its interpretalion, without visual observation or
accompanying quench dats; was equivocal.

Most of these difficulties were overcome Dy melting the mixtures in
an inert~atmosphere glove box (Figs. 1 and 2) and observing phase changes
through a window. Liguidus temperatures were determined accurately (nsv-

\

ally * 20°C) by noting the temperature at which the first crystals were
observed in a cooling melt. The melts were red manually to prevent
supercooling and to ensures unilTormity of composition and temperature.
Usually about & mole of salt contained in a hydrogen~fired, polished nickel
crucible was used for the study. Intense illumination was provided by a
Zirconarc photomierographic lamp (Fish-Schurman Corporation, New York).
The light from this instrument overrides the near infrared background
radiation from the melt to temperatures of aboul 1200°0C and thus facili-
tates determination of liguidus under conditions where other methods would
be difficult or impossible. Atmosphere control was obtained by evacuating
the glove box to 30 p sud refilling with helium purified by passage through
activated charcoal cooled with liquid nitrogen. The procedure is rapid.
As many as sixteen compositions in a given system can be studied in an

2

8=nr period by sequential additions of preweighed specimens. Since the
melt may be observed as phase changes occur, the apparatus 1s also useful
for obtaining interpretable thermal analysis data. To ensure accuracy,
the temperature recorder was periodically standardized against LiF melt-
ing at 848 * 10g, 22-24

The precision of temperature measurements obtainable in routine use
of Chromel-Alumel thermocouples is generally believed to be 59°C. Occa~
sional calibrations with pure salts have shown that the accuracy of thermal
transition temperatures reported here is within the #5°C precision limits.
Correspondingly, the accuracy of visual transition data reported here is
within #3°C.

A similar visual procedure called "visual polythermal method” has
been used by Russian investigators,” but their procedure seems inferior
to that used here in that it apparently does not permit (1) agitation of
the observed melt, (2) addition of salt during the run to alter the com-
position, or (3) use of vacuum to control the atmosphere.

A sharp increase in viscosity is often displayed by molten salts as
they cool to temperatures approaching the liquidus. This effect was noted
in most of the systems discussed in this report and was useful in signal-
ing the onset of crystallization. Such a sharp change in viscosity has
been observed also by Velyukov and Sipriya~? Tor NazAlFg and LizAlFe and
by B11is®’

phase~-trnasition temperatures was also noted. Preliminary measurement of

for ZnClz. A sharp change in the electrical conductance at

electrical conductance using an ohmmeter (Model 630, Triplett Electrical
Instrument Company, Bluffton, Ohio) indicated that it may also provide a
procedure useful for studying AlF; systems.

MATERIALS

Purity of the fluorides used in the phase studies was very important.
The molten-salt systems were studied primarily by a visual procedure which,
in determination of a liquidus temperature, depended on the appearance of
precipitate, often in such a form that it clouded the melt. Accordingly,
any impurity which clouded the melt interfered with the study. Because
they reacted to form very sparingly soluble phases, hydroxides and water
vapor proved to be especizlly objectionable and in some cases initially
very difficult to remove or avoid in the preparation of these fluorides.
Bydroxides and moisture were additionally objectionable because they
attacked the metal container, contaminating the melt with highly colored
nickel ion. Often such melts gave rise to irveproducible liguldus temper-
atures due, presumably, to a progressive increase in oxide concenbration
as the hydroxide reacted.

Three methods were found to be useful for preparing fluorides of low

oxygen conbent:

1. Vacuum sublimaiion: Applicable to purifying commercial
AlF3 and ZrFs, as the corresponding oxides have extremely
low volatility. Zr¥Fs was obtained with as little as

250 pom oxygen using the apparatus shown In Fg. 3.

2. Vacuum distillation after precipitation of oxide:
Applicable to KF. The vapor pressure of KOH at 850 to
10009C is high enough to preclude reduction of oxygen
impurity to less than 1200 to 1500 ppm by distillation.
However, in molten potassium fluoride, KOH reacts with
various “metal fluorides to precipitate metal oxides as
follows:

 

MF + KOH — MO 12) + XHET xK® oo,

and purification of KF is possible by vacuun distil~

poton from the remaining molten mixture The use of
‘oF2 and FeFa to precip tate oxide produc ced crystals

of KF which contained 200 ppm oxygen: the use of

2.3 mole % UF, pi. a product containing only 500 pp.

3. Amponium bifluoride fusion: Fusion of alkali metal
fluorides with hydrated AlFz in the presence of molten
NH HF; proved to he useful for preparing LiaAlFg,
NeafiFe, KahlFg, KAIF, , and Cs3A1Fg. Slow cooling of
the melts to promote crystal growth and selectlon of
the better~crystallized portion served to provide
additional purification. Fusion of NH HF with hy-
drated AlFa formed (NE4) 201Fs. Its thermal decampo-
sition at 600°C in a helium stream yielded anhydrous
AlFa which was comparable ja pucity vo the sublimed
product. Alkaline earth lluorides were also purified
by NH HF; treatment.

 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In the search for high-capacity solvent systems for use in the fluo-
ride volatility process, equilibrium solubility data for aluminum fluoride
in seven fluoride systems were obtained. The systems examined included
LiF-KF-AlF3, K3AlFg-LiF-CaFp, K3AlFg-LiF~SrFa, K3AlFe~LiF-Zn¥F,, LiF-Na¥F-
AlF3, NaF-KF-AlF3, and KF-ZrF4-Al¥3. The phase diagrams constructed from
the data obtained in these examinations show that only one of these systems,
KF-Zr¥F4~AlF 3, can be expected to have practical application as a solvent.
New data were obtained for the limiting binary systems LiF-AlF3, NaF-AlFs3,
KF-AlF3, and KF-ZrF4. New phase diagrams of each of these systems are
shown in Figs. 8 to 11. Experimental data for the systems reported here
were collected simultaneously for several systems, thus making it possible
to curtail the efforts on any one system as the development in another

system showed promise.

AlF3 Melting Point

Previously reported experimental values for the melting point of
AlF3 range from 98612 to 1040°¢. 28 All of our visual observation data
indicate that these values are low and that the melting point is higher
than the reported sublimation temperature, 12700¢, 2” though not as high
(1920°C) as was regarded by Steunenberg and Vogel. 0 Because high liquidus
temperatures and vapor pressures prevented visual study of mixtures con
taining over 56 mole % AlF3, too little data were obtained to permit a
good extrapolation of its melting point. Since AlFj3 is of similar struc-
ture to CrFyot and of comparable size relationship, = we surmise that its

equilibrium melting point at 1 atm is close to that for CrFj, 1404°C.

Systems Based on ILiF-KF

 

Mixtures of the lightest alkali fluorides, LiF, NaF, and KF, are not
so low melting as those obtainable with RbF or CsF; the cost of these latter
two materials, however, precludes their economic use in process development.
The binary mixture of the cheaper fluorides which affords the lowest-melting
. SE o..
solvent is the equimolar LiF-KF eutectic mixture which melts at 500°C (sec

Fig. 4). The phase diag

T the cystem LiF-XKE-Alka, constructed

ts
ria arc listed in Table 4. The diagram shows clearly that LiF-K¥ mixtures

&

 

cannot provide useful solvents because of the extent to which ths primary

y system LiF-Al¥a3. The ternary system is comprised of ©
subsystems KE-LiF-KzA1Fg, KaAlFg-11i2A1Fs~10F, and KaAlFg-LiaAlFR3. Both of
composition sections K381Fg-LiaAlFg and K3AlFs-1al" are apparantly quasi-

binary. The minimum liquidus temperature zlong the composition section
L

 

K3A1Fe-LiF is 720°C; along the section KaAllg-LizAlFg it is 645° The

high liguidus proiile for the system LiF-XK¥-A1Fj3 excludes LiF-KF mixtures

fram possible use as a sclvent. The possibility that the liguidus Tor same

The System LiF-Nal'-A1Fa
An examination was made of the liquidus surface of the LiF-NabF-AlFa

syebam at AlF; concentrations between 0 and 35 mole %. As in the LiF-KF-

1 system, the composition area at which liquidus temperatures are below
500°C is much too small for the system to be of practical value in the
volatility process. The phase disgram, shown in Fig. 6, is dominated by
the cryolite phase NazAlFe, which crystallizes from LiF-Na¥-Al¥F3 liquids
as 8 high-melting phase Tor much of the lower Al¥j3 part of the system.

Data obtained for the system are given in Table &.
The System NaF-KF-AlFg3

 

Preliminary investigation of the system NaF-KF-AlFj3; made by Barton
et a1.”” indicated that aluminum fluoride solubility was negligible in
NaF-KF mixtures except at temperatures above the NaF-KF eutectic. This
inference was corroborated by additional experiments conducted as part

of the present investigation.

The System KF-ZrFz-ALlFs3

 

Binary systems of the alkali fluorides with ZxFy afford low-melting
solvent mixtures for the heavy-metal fluorides UF; and ThFs and can be
expected to provide useful solvents for AlF3 as well. Other solvents
would be preferred because of the high cost of ZrF, and because of the
volatility of ZrFs4-rich liquids at high temperatures. Nevertheless, the
liguidus temperatures at concentrations of 35 to 45 mole % ZrFs in the
KF-ZrFs system and the availability of KpZrFe as an inexpensive reagent
suggested the use of the reagent in the preliminary evaluatlon of the
aluminum solvent systems. 1? The experimental data obtained in this inves-
tigation are shown in Table 9. The phase diagram of the system is shown
in Fig. 7. Crystallization reactions within the system KF~ZrF4;-AlF3 have
been characterized in detail except for those involving Al¥F3 and ZrF,.
Both of these components are high melting and volatile. Their phase reac-
tions are extremely difficult to examine at high temperatures because of
this volatility and their low heat of fusion, which preclude most dynamic
methods for obtaining phase data. Their crystallization reactions in the
ternary mixtures suggest that the only interaction ccecurring between them
at high temperatures is the formation of a eutectic. For these reasons,
we have omitted investigation of the limiting binary system AlF3-ZxF;. At
600°C, the maximm acceptable temperature for the process, a solvent, KF-
7xrFs (63-37 mole %), was found to have 15 mole % AlFj3 capacity. Idiquidus
temperatures In the binary system KF-ZrFs exclude the use of solvents
richer in ¥¥F. It can be seen from the phase diagram of the system KF-ZrFs4=-
MF; (Fig. 7), constructed in this study, that by a single addition of KF
after partial dissolution of the fuel element the solubility of AlF3 is
increased from 15 to 26 mole %.
