ABETRACT

In an expanding nuclear power economy, it may become desir-
able to remove noble~gas Tisslion products from spent-fuel proc-
essing plant off-gases. Technology is presently available for
removal of krypton and xenon, and after tley have been sep-
arated, it is proposed that the krypton be compressed in stand-
ard gas cylinders (either mixed with xenon, or after having
been separated from it), and shipped to a salt-mine repository
for permanent storage.

.
2

A plant reprocessing 2800 tons/year of fuel would produce
only 28 50-liter gas cylinders per year of krypton, each con-
taining about a million curies of Kr and generating about
5800 Btu of heat per hour. If the krypton and xenon were not
separated from each other, 160 cylinders /year would be produced,
each containing 180,000 curies of Kr and generating heat at
a rate of 1000 Btu/hr.

The pressurized gas cylinders could be stored temporarily
at the plant in water-filled canals, and then shipped to a
salt mine in specially~designed casks containing from one to
five cylinders each. Aft the mine, the cylinders could be
stored above the floor in rooms later sealed to isolate them
from the remainder of the mine. Under these conditions, the
carbon-steel cylinders should last many decades, and the mine
space required would be only about l-to-2 percent of that
required for storage of solidified high-level wastes.

The cost of noble-gas management by this method, exclusive
of the cost of separating the gases from the plant's process
off-gas, 1s estimated to range from $190,000 to $220,000 per
year. This corresponds to 0.0003 to 0.00035 mills /kwhr of
electricity originally produced from the fuel. From the stand-
point of the projected scale of operations, their estimated
costs, and considerations of safety, the proposed method appears
reasonable and manageable over the next several decades.

1. INTRODUCTION

In the processing of spent fuels, the noble-gas fission products are
separated from the fuel during the cladding-removal and core-dissolution
steps. At post~irradiation decay times of 150 days and longer, 10.8-y
Eker contributes greater than 99.9% of the total activity present in
these gases, and in the case of plants processing only a few tons per
day of 150-day-decayed fuel, they can generally be released through a
stack to the atmosphere without exceeding current discharge limits. Recent
studies have shown, however, that to avold exceeding the current guidelines
for radiation exposure of the public at a site boundary that is 2-to-3 km
distant, removal of noble gases may be required if the plant capacity ex-
ceeds about 9 tons/day of 150-day-decayed fuel.’ If the fuel is processed
after only 30 days decay, as might be the case in a fast-breeder economy,
removal may be required for plant capacities of only about 0.5 tons/day.
Reprocessing costs scale so as to favor larger plants, and since the cost
of rare-gas removal 1s expected to be less than that otherwise required
to extend the site boundaries, their removal can probably be justified

economically as well as from the standpoint of improved public relations.

There are a number of processes Tor separating the noble gases from
process off-gas which are either presently available or under development .=
Of these, the most attractive appear to be a process based on absorption

3

in a fluorocarbon solvent and the cryogenic distillation process cur-
rently in use at the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant. The absorption
process has been tested extensively on a pilot-plant scale, while the
cryogenic distillation process has been successfully applied in actual
plant operations. Bach has the potential for recovering greater than
99% of the gases with only a percent, or less, of nitrogen and oxygen

impurities in the final product.

Once the noble gases have been collected, however, there is less

certainty how best to contain them for the scores of years that are re-~

85 85

quired for decay of most of the Kr to stable Rb. One possibility

5,6,7

might be to Inject the gases into porous underground formations.

An acceptable formation for this purpose would have to be overlain with
Lad

a capping formation of very low permeability, be free of cracks or frac-
tures, and be located in a zone of lowest seismic risk. These considera-
tions appear to be too restrictive in determining fuel reprocessing plant
siting requirements for this method to serve as a generally applicable

solution to the problem.

Other possibilities which have been suggested, and in zome cases
investigated to limited extents, include dispersion of the gases in glasses
or resins, and entrapment in molecular sieves, clathrates, or small pres-
surized steel bulbs which are in turn encased in epoxy resin. In our
view, some of these methods may possibly have long~range applications, but
their technical and economic practicality can not be established until

they have received considerably more experimental development.

On the other hand, we believe that a valld and generally applicable
method for management of these gases, requiring little or no additional
experimental development, 1s to encapsulate them in high-pressure cylinders
and then ship the cylinders to a salt-mine repository where they would be
stored permanently with the solidified high-level wastes also generated
at the reprocessing plants. This proposed schedule of management operations,
including handling and temporary storage of the gases at the reprocessing
plants, shipment of the pressurized cylinders in specially-designed casks
of high integrity, and emplacement of the cylinders in rooms mined in a

salt formation, is examined below.

The authors gratefully acknowledge the help of W. C. T. Stoddart in
the conceptual design. of a shipping cask for pressurized cylinders of noble
gases, and of W. G. Stockdale in estimating the capital cost of the gas

packaging facility.

 

2. HANDLING OF COMPRESSED GASES IN CYLINDERS

The characteristics of the nbble-gas fission products present in a ton
of spent fuel from a "typical" light-water reactor (IMR), decayed 150 days,
and a liguid-metal-cooled fast-breeder reactor (IMFER), decayed 30 days and
150 days, are given in Table 1. There are no significant differences in

the characteristics of mixtures from fuels having equivalent exposures

and decay times. Although fast~breeder fuels may be processed with cooling
times of only 30 days, as compared with 150 days for IWR fuels, the only
radioisotope of consequence remaining after 150 days in either case is
Bore. All subsequent considerations refer to mixtures of this age obtained
from the fuels defined in Table 1.

The noble gases can be held in standard 50-liter cylinders, 9 in. in
diam by 52 in. high. Those conforming to ICC Specification 3pn7 have a
wall thickness slightly less than 1/L in., weigh 135 1b, and are normally
filled to 2200 psig in nitrogen service. Xenon and krypton are fairly
compressible at ambient temperatures, with compressibility factors (7 =
PV/nRT) reaching minima of 0.21 for xenon at 880 psia, and of 0.72 for
krypton at 2800 psia. Gas volumes per ton of fuel processed are shown in
Fig. 1 as functions of storage pressure. At 2200 psia for IWR fuels, these
values are 0.1 £63 [ton if both xenon and krypton are stored, or 0.018

£52 /ton iT the xenon is separated from the krypton and released. Volumes

for IMFBR fuel are about 10% lower.

A 2600-ton/year (10 tons/day) plant processing IWR fuel would produce
160 cylinders per year if both xenon and krypton are encapsulated, or 208
cylinders per year if only krypton is stored. The krypton activity is
11,200 curies/ton, or about 10° curies per cylinder if the krypton is
stored alone. On the other hand, the activity of a cylinder containing

both xenon and krypton is 180,000 curies.
3. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE

The consequences of an accidental release were studied using the
Gaussian plume formula of Gifford’ to determine the noble gas concen-
tration as a function of distance from the scurce, and time. Damage would
occur by personnel exposure alone, since the gases would not remain ag
contamination to cause property damage. The xenon activity is negligible
and the most important exposure would be the external whole-body beta dose
from the krypton. Following the formulation of Binford, Barish, and Kenn, TF

the concentration is given by

and yields a total dose of 120 mrem. For a release at a height of 10
meters, the maximum dose with any weather conditions and a wind velocity
of 100 m/sec is less than 15 rem. Present regulations (10 CFR 20 and 10
CFR 100) specify that chronic exposures of average popitlation groups shall
not exceed an annual whole-body dose of 170 mrem, and suggest that acute
whole-body exposures resulting from accidents should not result in a dose

greater than 25 rem.

Lh. ON-SITE INTERIM STORAGE

 

Although there is little incentive to keep the gases on-site for any
time longer than necessary to fill a shipping cask, a storage facility for
a 2600-ton/year plant would not be large or expensive, even if the gases
were stored for 10-to-20 years. The cylinders could he stored safely in
either air or water, provided they were securely anchored in compartments
or enclesures that afforded protection against impact by an accidentally
ruptured cylinder. However, the requirements for biological shielding and
heat dissipation would tend to favor the use of water-filled canals for

interim storage whether krypton was stored separately, or mixed with xenon.
If the cylinders are filled with krypton alone, and stored on 2-f1t
centers, a little more than 100 Pe of floor area is required for one
year's production of 28 cylinders. The heat-generation rate of a cylinder
is 5800 Btu/hr, and if it is cooled in alr by natural convection and
radiation, the cylinder would reach a temperature of about 315°F. These
cylinders would require about 2.6 inches of lead shielding for the dose
rate to be reduced to 10 mrem/hr at 1 meter,

If krypton and zenon are not separated, the 160 cylinders produced in
a year would require about 640 £2 of storage floor area. In this case,
the heat-generation rate per cylinder is 990 Btu/hr, and the shielding

requirement is 0.8 in. of lead.

. SHIPPING

Nn

 

The shipping cask ig basically a tank filled with water (Fig. 2). It
is a modification of one which has been shown to meet the impact, puncture,
and Tire resistance specifications of the AEC Manual, Chapbter 0529, and
which has been licensed for shipping capsules of curium oxide. The cask
is 5 ft in diameter, is made of l-in.-thick, type 304 stainless steel, and
is equipped with external fins to enhance heat dissipation. The water
provides shielding, serves as a heat transfer medium, and provides the
heat capacity needed to withstand a 1475°F fire for 30 winutes. A 200
psig rupture disc is provided as a safety measure in addition to 16 fusible
plugs, which are designed to allow steam to escape in case of a fire. In
addition, a vapor space is provided sufficiently large to hold the contents
of a leaky cylinder without causing the rupture disc to vent. In a cask of
the dimensions shown, the cylinder temperature would be aboub 20°F above
the ambient, and the rate of heat dissipation would be sufficient for one
cylinder of krypton, or about 5 cylinders of krypton~-xzenon mixture. A
loaded cask would weigh about 7 tons and we estimate it would cost about
$40,000. Standard railroad cars, 40 to TO £t in length, could carry

several casks.

f. PIRMANENT STORAGE

The cylinders could be stored permanently in a salt mine operated for
disposal of solidified high-level fuel-reprocessing wastes. Current plans
for high-level wastes are to place them in holes in the floor of rooms
mined in salt and, after filling, the rooms would be backfilled with crushed
galt and sealed.’ Disposal in the floor in this manner wag conceived
primarily because of the shielding requirements for personnel protection.
Cylinders of compressed gases, requiring only light shielding, could be
placed in racks above the mine floor and the rooms sealed without back-
filling with salt. The carbon-steel containers, in contact only with dry
air on the outside and noble gases on the inside, and isolated from
short-term temperature fluctuations, should last many decades and perhaps

centuries.

If the cylinders were stored in the immediate vicinity of the high-level
wastes, they would eventually reach a temperature of 200°C and a pressure
of 3500 psig. Therefore, 1t might ve desirable to increase the cylinder
wall thickness by 1/8 inch. The allowable heat~generation rate per unit
area of mine floor would be about 15-to~20 Btu/hr- £57 therefore, the space
requirements for a 2600-ton/year plant are about 1/4 acre per year for the
gases as opposed to about 16 acres per year for 6-year-old solidified

high-level wastes.

 

7. PRELIMINARY COST ESTIMATE

The economic feasibility of the scheme under consideration is indi-
cated by a cost estimate based on the requirenents for a 2600-ton/year
reprocessing plant. The sequence of operations is divided into three
stages: (1) filling, testing, and temporary storage of cylinders; (2)
shipment of the cylinders to a salt mine; and (3) permanent storage in the

mine.

A cell equipped for filling and testing cylinders would be contiguous
to the fuel reprocessing plant to facilitate the transfer of the noble gases

after they have been separated from the process off-gas; therefore, the
12

same canal used to store spent fuel and/or cans of solidified high-level
wastes can also be used to store the gas cylinders (Fig. 3). The cylinders
are moved from one station to the next by a dolly equipped with a
motor-driven chain drive, and they are unloaded and placed in a corner

of the storage canal with a hand-operated chain hoist suspended from a
monorail. A compressor transfers the noble gases from a gas holder (not
shown in Fig. 3) and compresses them in the cylinders. After a cylinder

is filled, a vacuum pump is used to evacuate the lines and return the
residual gases to the holder. During the filling operation, the equipment
is operated from outside the cell, and a lead-glass window 1s provided for
viewing. The cell contains a shadow-shield, however, to enable many oper-
ations such as gas=-1line connecticns to the cylinders, removal of the filled
cylinders from the dolly, and maintenance of the compressor and vacuum

pump to be performed by personnel in the cell. The ventilation air in the
S

8
cell is monitored continuously for 7

Kr, and provisions are made to seal
the cell automatically and contain the air if radioactivity is detected.
In such a case, the air in the cell could be recycled to the noble-gas
separation plant for decontamination. This facility is capable of packag-
ing either the 160 cylinders /year of krypton-xenon mixtures, or the 28
cylinders /year that would be required if krypton, alone, were to be

encapsulated.

The total capital cost of the facility is estimated to be $230,000
(Table 2). If the equipment is amortized over 10 years, and the structure
over 20 years, at 5% interest, the equivalent annual capital cost is
$24,000 (Table 3). The cost of the cylinders should not exceed $100 each,
based on the cost of ordinary nitrogen cylinders of about $50. Therefore,
the annual cylinder cost is $16,000 for krypton-xenon mixtures, or $2800
for krypton. alone. Annual operating costs, based on an estimated require-
ment of 1 man year Tor mixtures and 1/2 man year for krypton are $20,000

and $10,000, respectively.

Shipping costs consist of the cask capital costs, freight, and labor
costs. For round-trip shipments of 1000, 2000, and 3000 miles, transit
Times (i.e., the times required between successive shipments in the same

cask) are estimated at 7, 9, and 11 days. Therefore, even for the longest

distance considered, one cask could make the required 32 trips per year.
A spare cask is supplied, however, at $40,000 per cask, and amortization
over 10 years at 5% interest results in an equivalent annual capital cost

of $10,400.

Freight rates are estimated at 29, 53, and 78 dollars per ton for
one-way shipments of 500, 1000, and 1500 miles, with rates 30% lower for
return of empty casks. The casks weigh about 7 tons, loaded, and 3-1/2
tons with the cylinders and water removed; and the freight cost for 32
1500-mile shipments, with each shipment consisting of 5 cylinders filled
with krypton and xenon, is $23, 600. For 28 shipments per year, with each
shipment consisting of one cylinder filled with krypton, the cost is $20,700.
Tabor requirements for loading, unloading, and maintaining the casks are
estimated to be 9 man-days per trip, and at $100 per man-day (including
overhead), labor costs of $29,000 per year are estimated for shipping

krypton-xenon mixtures and $25,000 per year for shipping krypton alone.

A salt-mine repository for highly active solidified wastes has been
estimated to cost $381,000 per acre of mine area, including all capital
and operating expenses . 1° As discussed previously, the noble gases, with
an effective half-life of about 10 years, can be stored so that they release
about 15 Btu/hr-£t° of mine floor. Therefore, about 0.25 acres/year of mine
space are required for either the mixed noble gases or for krypton alone.

The permanent storage cost is $95, 300 per year.

The total cost of the packaging facility, freight, and permanent
storage 1s about $218,000 per year Tor krypton-xenon mixtures, and about
$188,000 per year for krypton. Considering that the 2600 tons of fuel
represents the production of 6.6 x ott kwhr of electricity, these costs

correspond to 0.0003 and 0.00035 mills /kwhr, respectively.

Reasonable numbers of pressurized cylinders, casks, and shipments per year
can be anticipated. If a shipment consists of a single railroad car carry-
ing 5 casks, only about 30 shipments per year would be required in the year
2000, and on the average, there will never be more than one loaded shipment
in transit at the same time. Only 17 acres of salt mine area would be
occupied by the gas cylinders, compared with more than 600 acres devoted

to high-level solidified wastes. None of these considerations are of a

magnitude as to cause concern with respect to their technical feasibility.
