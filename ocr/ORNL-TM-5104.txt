ABSTRACT

The sorption of tritium by molten lithium-bismuth (Li-Bi, ~ 15 at.
% lithium) and solid equiatomic lithium-aluminum (Li-Al) was investigated
experimentally to evaluate the potential applications of both materials
in a controlled thermonuclear reactor. The Li-Bi alloy was proposed to
countercurrently extract tritium from a molten salt (Li_BeF) ) blanket.
However, because of the low solubility (< 10 ppb) at temperatures ranging
from 500 to TO0°C, the extraction process is not attractive.

Powell of Brookhaven National Laboratory has proposed using solid
Ii-Al as a minimum inventory blanket material. In the present study,
the tritium sorption was determined to range from 107 to 1076 at. frac-
tion, which is in agreement with Powell's estimates. The quantities of
tritium sorbed seemed to be controlled by surface reaction and/or slow
internal diffusion.

The feasibility of the tritium recovery scheme suggested by Johnson
for the Princeton Reference Design Tokamak was analyzed. The spray
disengager process to recover tritium from molten salt seems discouraging

due to the large jet velocity, the number of nozzles, and the droplet

size needed for mass transfer of tritium fluoride from salt.

CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION

The feasibility of commercial fusion power reactors depends upon the
development of effective methods for containing and recovering tritium.
Difficult problems are expected to be encountered in the handling,
recovery, and containment of the fuel inventory of a controlled thermo-
nuclear reactor (CTR) fueled with tritium and deuterium. Deuterium can
be obtained from natural waters; however, tritium, which does not exist
in useful concentrations in nature, must be generated by neutron bombard-
ment of lithium-containing material in a blanket surrounding the reactor
plasma. It is necessary to recycle tritium and deuterium from the exhaust
plasma and to recover bred tritium from its blanket system for subsequent
use as fuel. Stringent limitations must be imposed on the use of tritium
concentrations in the system because of the direct effect spon the tritium
inventory, the tritium release rate to the environment, and the embrittle-
ment of structural materials by helium resulting from tritium decay.

Lithium-containing materials have been proposed for a variety of
applications in CTRs. It is suggested in this study that molten lithium-
bismuth (Li-Bi) alloy could be useful for extracting tritium from a CTR
breeding blanket consisting of a molten mixture of lithium end beryllium
fluorides. Of course, the applicability of such a recovery system depends
upon the equilibrium uptake of tritium by the Li-Bi alloy. Power (30)
has suggested using a solid lithium-aluminum (Li-Al) alloy in the tritium
breeding blanket. The alloy plus its aluminum structure would produce a

minimum neutron activation and a low tritium inventory. However, the

 
 

 

usefulness of the material is contingent upon its sorption of tritium
and its ability to rapidly exchange tritium with a flush gas such as
helium. |

The objectives of this study were to evaluate experimentally the
potential application of Li-Bi and Li-Al in a CTR. Thus, the tritium
solubility and thermochemical behavior of the lithium alloys were inves-

tigated. The Pennsylvania State University is not licensed to work rou-

~ tinely with amounts of tritium greater than 100 uCi. Since samples of

more than ten times that amount were needed to attain meaningful experi-
mental results, this study was conducted at the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory (ORNL) as part of the Oak Ridge Associated Universities' Pro-
gram.

Another objective of the research was to analyze the blanket recovery
system proposed for the Princeton Reference Design CTR (21). In this con-
ceptual design, tritium is generated from a molten fluoride salt blanket.
The practicality of the blanket processing system was reviewed in this
report by studying each of the required process steps and estimating the

feasibility and equipment size involved.

CHAPTER II

: REVIEW OF LITERATURE

xy

Many conceptual and engineering designs have been made for a CTR
(13,14,26,30,32). Most of the CTR concepts resemble the system shown in

Fig. 1. The thermonuclear reactions that release energy are:

D+T + “He + n, 17.6 MeV eq. 1
D+D =~» T+H, 4.03 MeV eq. 2
D+D He +n, 3.27 MeV eq. 3
D + He + MHe + H, 18.3 MeV eq. b
H + 614 > 3He + bie. 4.0 Mev eq. 5

For the first generation of thermonuclear reactors, the deuterium-tritium
(D-T) reaction is favored because it releases one of the largest quanti-
ties of energy and its probability of occurrence (cross section) is the

highest of the above reactions (19). In a D-T reactor, a small percen-:

#)

tage of the D-T mixture fuses during its residence in the plasma region.
This fusion generates high-energy neutrons which deposit heat in the
surrounding blanket fluid. The energy is then transferred to a secondary
coolant fluid connected to a conventional steam cycle.

Tritium must be bred to fuel the reactor at a rate equal to, or
greater than, the rate at which it is consumed in the plasma. The neu-

tron bombardment of lithium produces tritium by the following reactions:

6.5 +n > bye + T, eq. 6
Tri +n > be + ot + T. eq. T
{ . Lithium must be included in the blanket material for breeding purposes.

Subsequently, tritium handling systems are needed to recover tritium

from the blanket for recycling to the plasma. Although tritium breeding
is not necessary for the deuterium-deuterium (D-D) and deuterium-helium
(D-He) fuel cycles, tritium will be broduced by D-D reactions (Equa-
tion 2) and handling systems will still be required, although the prob-
lems will probably be less severe.

Low tritium concentrations must be maintained in the blanket mate-
rial by a tritium recovery system. Tritium has a half-life of 12.3 years

and undergoes radioactive decay according to the reaction

3

T + “He + e + 5.6 keV. eq. 8

The current Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA)
guidelines on radioactivity in effluents from light-water-cooled fission
fission reactors require (a) that the dose rate at the site boundary not
exceed 5 millirems/year and (b) that the annual average concentration of
tritium prior to dilution in a natural body of water not exceed 5 x 1073
uCi/liter (39). When considering a v 1000-MW(e) fusion reactor, these
guidelines imply (a) that the release of tritium into coolant water
should be limited to ~ 10 Ci/day and (b) that the amount discharged
through a stack (v 30 m high) should be limited to ~ 10 to 100 Ci/day
(37,38). However, current designs of fusion reactors attempt to limit
tritium release rates to a range of v 1 to 10 Ci/day. This limitation
constrains the concentration of tritium in the blanket material. Trit-
ium, which is extremely mobile, will diffuse through all metal structures
and heat transfer surfaces. Large concentrations of tritium in the
blanket would lead to high release rates; therefore, the blanket must be

processed to achieve the lowest possible concentration of tritium.

 
 

materials with very little long-lived activation (e.g. aluminum), which

The thermonuclear power systems will process the blanket material
within the blanket loop, as shown in Fig. 1; however, the choice of
blanket and coolant fluids will have an important effect in the tritium -
recovery scheme. The two reactor designs of interest in the present
study are those proposed by the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (26)
and the Brookhaven National Laboratory (30). Princeton's Reference
Tokamsk produces 2030 MW of electric power. The blanket material chosen
to generate tritium is a mixture of lithium and beryllium fluorides
(Li BeF)). Helium was chosen as a coolant to carry heat from the Li BeF)
blanket to the steam system. The Brookhaven conceptual design suggests
a solid Li-Al alloy as a blanket material in which tritium is bred and a

helium coolant stream. This concept is advantageous because structural

are not compatible with Li BeF), can be used.

Recovery of tritium from molten Li BeF) is difficult because the
tritium concentration in the salt must be maintained at less than 1 ppm
to prevent tritium leekage. Watson (41) has drawn several conclusions
from an evaluation of the tritium recovery process for the Li BeF)
blanket. Cold trapping and solid sorbents are not attractive due to the
limited operating temperature range imposed by the salt and possible
tritium permeation through regenerator surfaces. Diffusion cells are not
practical because of salt corrosivity and liquid film resistance. Counter-
current gas sparging with either helium or argon may be possible if a -
suitable compromise between the sparge rate and corrosion can be made.

This necessitates that tritium pressures in the range of 1078 to 1071

 
 

 

 

 

oo

a

atm and tritium fluoride (TF) pressures in the range of 1072 to 107% atm
be maintained.

In this study, the proposal examined is one in which Li BeF) would
be contacted with an immiscible diffusion sink in a countercurrent liquid
extractor. A tritium getter, added to the molten metal, would form a
hydride to reduce the equilibrium activity of tritium and to obtain low
tritium concentrations in the salt phase. The contacting medium investi-
gated was Li-Bi, with lithium being the tritium getter. The tritium is
then recovered from the molten Li-Bi either by a precipitation process or
in diffusion cells.

The experimental apparatus used to determine the equilibrium distri-
bution of tritium at low concentration levels in molten Li-Bi was a modi-
fication of that utilized previously at ORNL for phase equilibrium studies
of molten salt and molten metal systems (12). The concentration of Li-Bi
compatible with Li Bef) was determined by using available thermodynamic
date (Appendix A). Lithium will reduce beryllium from the Li_BeF) at
large concentrations and will subsequently form another immiscible phase.
A maximum concentration of 15 at. % lithium in bismuth was chosen for the
tritium solubility experiment; this molten alloy is compatible with
Li BeF) at the temperatures observed. The proposed extractor would use
a lesser concentration of about 1 at. % lithium and operate at 900°K.

The process suggested by Johnson (21) in the Princeton Reference
Tokamak study offers another method for recovering tritium from Li BeF).
The molten salt is sprayed continuously into eight towers which are main-
tained below 107 atm and located around the reactor system. TF and

helium gases vaporize from the tiny droplets and are drawn through cold

 
 

 

 

traps, where all the TF is frozen out. The salt is collected at the

bottom of each discharger and recirculated through the blanket. Period-

ically, the nitrogen-cooled traps are thawed, and liquid TF flows into

electrolytic cells, where it is electrolyzed to T,

‘and F,. The tritium
is recycled to the primary fuel loop. | |
The tritium recovery scheme for the solid-lithium-containing blanket
proposed by Brookhaven (30) seems less complex in comparison to the
Li BeF) recovery systems. The tritium bred in the Li-Al alloy diffuses
out of the solid, either into the vacuum region between the plasma, and
the first wall or into the helium coolant stream. By letting the tritium
diffuse directly into the vacuum region, the tritium concentration in the
Li-Al will eventually reach a steady-state value as it is released at
the same rate that it is bred. If the resistence to tritium release is
sufficiently small, the steady-state concentration will differ little
from equilibrium conditions. = If the vacuum region is maintained at 107°
torr tritium pressure (1 torr equals 1 mm Hg of pressure) and the residual
gas is assumed to be 100% tritium, the equilibrium atom fraction of trit-
ium in Li-Al is about 2 x 1076 (30). This corresponds to a tritium blan-
ket inventory of about 160 g (2 x 10° Ci). Since ~ 300 g of tritium will
be burned daily in the plasma, 2 x 1076 atom fraction represents less than
a day's inventory. If the tritium inventory in the blanket is too large,
protium (normal hydrogen) could be used to scavenge the tritium. Finally,
the tritium is recovered, combined with purified D-T fuel from the plasma,
and recycled to the plasma.

Alternatively, the tritium could diffuse out the Li-Al into the

helium coolant stream, where it is removed by absorption in a metal

hydride bed from which it is later recovered. The atom fraction of trit-
5

ium in Li-Al is estimated to be ~ 3 x 10 °, which is an order of magnitude
greater than the previous case (30). The tritium concentration in the
helium depends on the flow rate of helium coolant and the tritium diffu-
sion rate. Again, additions of protium could lower the tritium concen-
tration.

However, the difficulty of removing tritium from Li-Al depends upon
both the equilibrium tritium concentration in Li-<Al and the tritium
diffusion rate in Li-Al. An experimental study by Wiswall and Wirsing
(43) tested the removal of tritium from granular forms of Li-Al, LiAl0,,
and L1i,510,. The procedure was to flush helium through a bed of irra-
diated compounds at a controlled temperature in the range 400 to 600°C.
Tritium, generated by exposure to thermal neutrons, diffused out of a
sample and was carried to a tritium monitor. The data collected were
not successfully analyzed in terms of a physical model. Removal rates
were increased both by an increase in the helium flow rate and by addi-
tions of 1000 ppm of hydrogen to the helium; this shows that surface
sorption is important. Yet, the escaping rate increased with a decrease
in particle size, which indicates a slow diffusion within the alloy.

This would also result from surface sorption, for the same loading, and

surface resistance.

CHAPTER III

THEORY

The recovery of tritium from CTR materials depends on its distribu-
tion and leakage characteristics. These factors are determined by tritium
solubility in the contacted materials, tritium diffusion rates through
reactor fluids and structural components, and the formation of stable
compounds.

The reaction for solutions of tritium in a metal can be written as

follows:

solutions of tritium in metals, the relationship between solubility and

where

where

According to Cantor and Grimes (6), the solubility of tritium in molten

salt is related by Henry's law, which is expressed as follows:

CHAPTER IV

EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS AND PROCEDURE

Reagents
The bismuth was obtained from the Cominco American Company (99.9999%

purity). The lithium metal was supplied by Fischer Scientific Company.
Just prior to loading under an argon atmosphere, the pure lithium was cut
and cleaned of oxide film. The Li-Al alloy was prepared by the Metals
and Ceramics Division of ORNL. The procedure consisted of wrapping known
amounts of lithium in aluminum foil, submerging the packets into a known
quantity of molten aluminum (99.999% purity) contained in a molybdenum
crucible, and continually mixing the alloy with a molybdenum stirrer. A
50-50 at. % mixture was then cast into 1/4~in.-0D rods (9). Each sample
was approximately l/h to 1/2: in. long and weighed about 0.5 g. The alloy
rods were thinly coated with a bluish oxide film. The intermetallic com-
pound Li-Al is a solid solution between 45 and 56 at. % lithium (18).
Li-Al displays a glasslike brittleness, and its density has been deter-
mined as 1.725 g/ml at room temperature (2). The equiatomic composition
melts at 718°C.

All gases were of the highest purity commercially available. Argon,

‘which was used as the inert cover gas, was further purified by passage

through a titanium sponge trap; the lower section was held at 600°C for
the removal of oxygen and water, and the upper portion was held at about
200°C for the removal of hydrogen. Tritium, obtained from the ORNL Isotopes
Division, was supplied in 3/8-in. glass ampules, each containing 1 Ci in

a volume of 1 ml (pressure equal to v 324 torr).

Apparatus

Li-Bi Sorption System. Equilibration and tritium sorption were con-

 

ducted in a vessel of the type shown in Fig. 2. The apparatus has been
used previously at ORNL for phase equilibria studies of molten salts and
molten metal systems (12). Figure 3 illustrates the reaction vessel in
detail. The vessel was fabricated from a 22-in. length of 2-in.-0D
stainless steel pipe. Cooling fins welded to the exterior of the upper
section of the vessel served both to cool and to support the vessel when
it was positioned in a well-type furnace, which heated 6 in. of the con-
tainer. A gas outlet tube was welded into the pipe between the furnace
support and the flange. The upper flange section was fitted with a 1/2-
in. ball valve, a thermocouple port, and a 1/L4-in.-diam molybdenum sparge
tube (nv 10 to 20-mil wall thickness). A Cajon O-ring fitting at the top
of the sparge tube allowed raising and lowering. A Teflon plug, through
which the samplers were inserted, was held in place by another O-ring,
which was connected to the top of the ball valve. The Li-Bi alloy was
contained in a molybdenum crucible 6 in. long, 1-1/2 in. ID, and 1-3/k
in. OD. The molybdenum crucible fitted loosely in the reaction vessel
as shown in Fig. 3. The apparatus was operated in a radiochemical hood,
which also provided secondary containment of tritium.

The temperature of the system wes measured by a calibrated Chromel-
Alumel thermocouple and recorded by a Brown potentiometric recorder. The
temperature of the system was controlled with + 2°C by a Wheelco propor-
tional controller operating from a control thermocouple, which was placed

against the exterior wall of the reactor vessel.

The samplers were constructed as follows:

"The filter-type samplers were fabricated of stainless steel.
The l-in.-long body was drilled from heavy-walled, 1/4-in.-
OD tubing, leaving a 1/8-in.-thick shoulder on one end; the
wall thickness after drilling was about 30 mils. A 20-in.
length of 1/16-in.-0D capillary tubing was welded into the
shoulder to provide the stem for the sampler. The sampler
was completed by welding a disk of FELTMETAL fiber metal
(Huyck Metal Co., product No. FM 225), having a median pore
size of 20 pu, into the open end of the body." (12)

Li-Al Sorption System. The preliminary sorption apparatus was con-

~

structed of Pyrex to minimize tritium permeation from the system. Figure

 

4 shows a schematic of the equipment. Four Pyrex sample tubes were
attached by ground-glass joints to a 4-ft-long by 1/2-in.~-0D manifold;

a mechanical vacuum pump was connected to one end of the manifold. Dow-
Corning high-vacuum grease (No. 970V), a nonmelting silicone lubricant,
was sparingly applied to the ground-glass and stopcock joints. High-
vacuum stopcocks were used throughout the system. The pressure of the
system was measured by a Virtis McCloud mercury manometer (0.005 to 5.00

3

torr) and a Hastings vacuum gauge (10 ~ to 1 torr).

Each sample tube was positioned in a 1-1/k4-in.~ID clamshell furnace.
The temperature of each sample was measured by a calibrated Chromel-
Alumel thermocouple and indicated on & Doric Digital Thermocouple Indicator
(No. DS-300) (-50 to +1350°C). The temperatures were controlled within
+ 2°C by a Wheelco proportional controller operating from a control
thermocouple placed against a copper shield inside each furnace.

The tritium leakage from the ground-glass joints and vacuum stop-
cocks was excessive at the l-torr tritium partial pressure involved.

Although glass joints proved to be adequate for previous ORNL studies of

tritium sorption in lithium, the resulting errors became significant when

materials with low tritium uptake were used. - Thus, a more reliable stain-
less steel system was built.

Figure 5 shows a schematic of the revised tritium sorption system
used in this study. The pumping system had been used previously at ORNL
as part of a Sieverts' apparatus for obtaining measurements of equilibrium
hydrogen isotope solubilities in lithium (35). This pumping systen con~
sisted of a mechanical pump coupled to a Consolidated Vacuum Corporation
oil diffusion pump. The pressure measurement instruments included two
Wallace and Tiernan precision pressure gauges, Model FA160 (0 to 20 torr)

and Model 62A-4D-0800 (0 to 800 torr), and a Hastings vacuum gauge (10 -3

to 1 torr). The sorption system consisted of four 1/2-in.-0OD by 1lh-in.-
long quartz sample tubes connected to a. 3-ft-long manifold. The manifold
was constructed of 1/k-in. stainless steel tubing. Each quartz tube was
lined with a 10-in.-long by 3/8-in.-OD thin-walled (about 10 mil) stain-
less steel tube. A Cajon O-ring fitting connected each quartz tube to a
Hoke vacuum valve, which was attached to the sorption manifold by another
O-ring Joint. Hoke vacuum valves were used throughout the system. Figure
6 shows a photograph of the equipment.

Each sample tube was positioned in a 1-1/L4~in.-ID clamshell furnace
by raising a lab-jack which had been placed underneath each furnace. The
temperature of each sample tube was measured by a calibrated Chromel-
Alumel thermocouple and recorded by a Brown potentiometric recorder. A
Wheelco proportional controller regulated temperatures within + 2°C. A
control thermocouple was placed against a copper shield inside each fur-

nace.

Operational Procedures

Li-Bi Sorption System. About 600 g of bismuth and 3.47 g of lithium
(v 15 at. %) were loaded under an argon atmosphere into a molybdenum cru-
cible, which was placed inside the reaction vessel. The upper flange
section was bolted into place. To test for leaks, the vessel was pres-
surized with argon. After ensuring that no leaks were present, the sys-
tem was heated to 600°C to melt the Li-Bi for sample analysis. (See
Sampling Procedure section.) The molybdenum sparge tube was lowered into
the molten metal, and argon was bubbled through the Li-Bi. The tritium
ampule was attached to the sparge tube; the system was evacuated to about
0.1 torr; and the seal within the ampule was broken. To break the glass
seal, a small metal bar was placed inside the ampule before attaching it
to the sparge tube. Then a magnet was used to pull the bar through the
seal, releasing the tritium. Argon was subsequently passed through the
sparge tube to sweep the residual tritium into the Li-Bi alloy; the total
system pressure was thereby increased to about 3 psi. Throughout the
experiment (except during sampling), the system was kept under a 1- to
S5-psi static argon pressure. A period of at least 24 hr was allowed to
attain equilibrium at each temperature (500, 600, or 700°C). Pairs of
liquid and gas samples were removed for analysis.

Sampling Procedure. Each sampler was polished with emery paper
before use. The stem of the sampler was then forced through a hole in
the Teflon plug and connected to a flexible tube which leads to a —
fold supplying both argon and vacuum. The sampler was placed in the upper
chamber of the ball valve, and argon was flushed through the sampler and

chamber for several minutes. Subsequently, the Teflon plug was inserted

 
 

2h
into the O-ring fitting and tightened. The ball valve was then opened
and the sampler, with argon flowing through it, was lowered and positioned
in the liquid alloy. The flow of argon was continued for 2 to 5 min while

the sampler was heated to the temperature of the alloy. The argon flow

was stopped, and a vacuum was applied to the sampler. Li-Bi rapidly

+ filled (< 10 sec) the sampler and solidified in the cool part of the

capillary stem, thus sealing the sampler. The sampler was then drawn into
the upper chamber, and the ball valve was closed. The outside of the
filled sampler was carefully polished with emery cloth, and the stem

and filter ends were removed with tubing cutters. The remaining part of
the sampler contained about 2 g of Li-Bi. The metal sample was dissolved
in nitric acid, and the solution was analyzed for tritium.

Gas-phase sampling involved first inducing a vacuum on the 4. 5-m1-
volume gas sample tubing. The sampler was filled by opening a valve to
the vessel and releasing the gas. The valve to the reaction vessel was
then closed, and the gas sample was slowly flushed to the analysis system
by using argon containing a trace of hydrogen as a carrier gas. For trit-
ium concentrations below 5 x 10° uCi /m>, the vapor phase was analyzed by
a Triton monitor (Johnston Laboratory, Inc., Model 1055 B). For higher
tritium concentrations, the tritium was oxidized at 600°C on CuO and
trapped in water bubblers, Samples of the bubbler fluids vere analyzed
by liquid scintillation. | |

Li-Al Sorption System. The preliminary glass apparatus was operated
as described below. One rod-shaped Li-Al sample was loaded under an inert

atmosphere into each Pyrex tube. A vacuum stopcock was attached to each

sample tube and closed also under an inert atmosphere. The sorption

manifold was evacuated and checked for leaks. The sample tubes were
fastened to the manifold, and the total system was pumped down to about
1072 torr to remove any residual gas.

After ensuring that there were no leaks, the sample tubes were posi-
tioned in the furnaces, heated to sbout 400°C, and continually evacu-
ated, as the Li-Al outgassed, until the system pressure remained steady.
Tritium was added as described in the Li-Bi sorption experiment. Usu-
ally, at least 24 hr was allowed for the Li-Al samples and tritium to
equilibrate. Finally, the sample tubes were quickly cooled with a flow
of air to ambient temperature and the samples were removed for analysis.

The procedure for operating the stainless steel system was similar
to that used for the Pyrex equipment. A sample was loaded into each
stainless~steel-lined quartz tube under an inert atmosphere. The sample
was either used in rod form or was crushed into a powder (< 20 mesh).
The vacuum valve was attached to the tube and tightly closed under an
inert atmosphere. The pumping system and sorption manifold were evacu-
ated. After ensuring that no leaks were present, the sample tubes were
fastened to the evacuated manifold. Then the entire system was pumped
down to approximately 1072 torr to remove any residual gas. Again, the
system was tested for leaks, and the sample tubes were positioned in the
furnaces and heated. The system was continually evacuated until the
pressure remained steady. Tritium was added to the sorption system from
a glass ampule. The amounts of tritium used ranged from 1 to 16 Ci. The
Li~-Al samples and tritium were allowed to equilibrate for at least 24 hr
at temperatures ranging from 400 to 600°C. After the samples had cooled

to ambient temperature, they were removed for analysis.

Analytical Procedure

 

The Li-Bi and Li-Al samples were analyzed by dissolving them in
nitric acid and counting a dilute portion of the resulting solutions by
liquid scintillation. Figure T shows the apparatus used in the dissolu-
tion process. A sample was placed in a -300-ml reaction flask. After an
argon sweep gas had been established, a guantity of warm 75% nitric acid
in excess of the amount necessary to react with the sample was poured into
the flask. As the sample dissolved, the released tritium was oxidized by
hot CuO (600°C) and captured in water bubblers. A trace of hydrogen was
added to the argon to continuously flush tritium from the CuO bed and
tubing walls. Since the granular Li-Al samples reacted violently when
nitric acid was added, a modified technique was used to dissolve the
crushed samples. A sample was placed into the reaction flask, and water
was slowly sprayed from a syringe to start the dissolution. Once the
reaction was controlled, nitric acid was added and the aliquots were
analyzed. The gas-phase samples were also swept through the CuO bed,
and the tritium was trapped in the water bubblers. About 90% of the oxi-
dized tritium was captured in the first bubbler; thus, essentially all
the tritium was trapped by two bubblers in series. The tritium monitor
did not register above background tritium in the gas exiting the second
water bubbler.

Diluted aliquots from the reaction vessel and the water bubblers
were analyzed by conventional liquid scintillation techniques. The scin-
tillation solution recipe was:

12 g PPO (2,5-diphenyloxazole)

0.3 g POPOP (1,4-bis-2(5-phenyloxazolyl)benzene)

2010 ml of toluene
990 ml of Triton X~100 (an emulsifier product of Rohm and Haas)

One milliliter of the sample solution was mixed with 10 ml of the scintil-
lation counting solution. The tritium in each solution was detected by
a Packard Model 5T4 Tri-carb scintillation spectrometer, which had an

efficiency of about 20%. Samples were also analyzed by a similar method

by the ORNL Analytical Chemistry Division.

CHAPTER V

EXPERIMENTAL DATA

Li-Bi Sorption System

The analytical results in Table II and Table III show that the quan-
tities of tritium sorbed by molten Li-Bi were very low. Because of the
diffusion of tritium through the stainless steel reactor and the leakage
during sampling, the total amounts of tritium continuously decreased from
the initial 1 Ci addition to about 10 Ci. Therefore, the solubility of
tritium in Li-Bi ranged from about 0.1 to 0.01 ppb, respectively. Multi-
ple netal-phase samples were taken to check the reproducibility of the
sampling and analysis techniques. However, samples 2.1 to 2.7 were
exceptions, and the values in Table II represent, only one concentration
value rather than an average of several values as do the remainder of
samples. Since the tritium concentration in the gas was substantially
greater than that in the Li-Bi, cross-contamination was found from using
one Cul bed and contaminated bubblers. Consequently, the lowest concen-—
tration value was used for the first seven samples. For the rést of the
samples, a separate catalyst bed was used for each phase analysis and
all glassware was carefully cleaned between runs. Reproducibility of
the gas-phase analyses in Table III was checked by a tritium monitor at
levels of less than 5 x 103 WCi/mS.

The ideal gas law was applied to determine tritium partial pressures
above the Li-Bi phase. Data were taken at 500, 600, and TO0°C. How-
ever, most of the simultaneous gas and metal sampling was done at 600°C.
Figure 8 shows all the data points and a least-squares fit of the data

at 600°C. The equation represented by the straight line is:

From statistical analysis, ‘the data at 600°C fall within the 95% confi

the line.

Li-Al Sorption System

The tritium sorption data for Li-AL are shown in Tables Iv and’ V. -
The time-dependent data of Table IV at 400°C ‘were measured when the sys-
tem pressure was not remaining steady. The leakage problem vas resolved,
and constant-pressure measurements vere taken (see Table V). Also, the
most reliable data points are presented in Table V. Partial dissolution
of Li-Al samples shows that the concentration of tritium decreases as a
function of dissolved Li-Al (Table IV). Figure 9 ‘shows the data. graphi-
cally. |

The limited data have noticeable discrepancies; however, the tritium
concentration in the rod samples range from 0.01 to A rt pen for tritium
pressures of 0.14 to 5.42 torr, respectively. The concentration of
tritium was generally higher in most of the powdered samples.

The chemical properties of Li-Al were more complex then was initially
anticipated. According to the phase diagram (18), Li-Al forms an equi-
atomic homogerieous solid solution. Yet, during heating of the samples,

condensed on the cooled portion of the quartz sample tube. Initially,
stainless. steel liners were not inserted in the sample tubes to contain
the Li-Al; the quartz tubes were attacked and cracked by the substance.
Silica compounds, such as quartz, are rapidly attacked by molten lithium
(15); therefore, it was suspected that excess lithium was present. To
analyze the constituents of the volatilized material, a time-of-flight
mass spectrometer experiment was conducted by John Redman of the ORNL
Chemistry Division. Several Li-Al samples were analyzed both under
vacuum and with a pure hydrogen flow. The temperature of the sample
ranged from 400 to 650°C; however, no lithium~-containing vapor species
were observed. This behavior needs to be verified before Li-Al is

selected for a CTR blanket material.

CHAPTER VI

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

Li-Bi Sorption System

The solubility of tritium in molten Li-Bi (~ 15 at. % lithium) was
determined to be less than 10 ppb at temperatures ranging from 500 to
700°C. Therefore, an extraction process based on this alloy would not
be feasible.

The pressure-concentration relationship of Equation 15 does not
correspond to Sieverts' law (Equation 11) or Henry's law, which states
that the tritium partial pressure would be directly proportional to its
concentration in the solution. If data followed Henry's law, the error
of the slope could be due to impurities in the metal. However, formation
of intermetallic Li-Bi compounds could cause a slope between 1 and 2. A
temperature dependence cannot be determined from the scatter of data from
Fig. 8. Further experiments would be needed to provide these correla-
tions. ©Since the data clearly show that the proposed process is not
practical, no further experiments were made in this area.

With appropriate equipment alterations, the leakage rate of tritium
could be reduced and the sampling technique could be improved. Neverthe-
less, at such low solubility levels, the sensitivity of the liquid scin-
tillation counting of samples could not be increased to enhance the
accuracy of the data. Thus it was concluded that, due to the low sorp-
tion of tritium in Li~Bi, the proposed extraction process would not
suffice as a tritium recovery method for a CTR molten salt blanket.

Further experiments are not likely to alter these conclusions.

 
 

 

38

One reason for the low solubility of tritium in Li-Bi is that the
lithium present is bonded so strongly with bismuth (18) that lithium
tritide is not easily formed. It has been suggested that Li-Pb, which
is chemically similar to the Li-Bi 8lloy, be used for neutron shields
and collimators (15). Previous studies suggest that this material is
potentially useful because it is relatively inexpensive, easily handled
and fabricated, and stable in air at temperatures over 200°C and neutron
fluxes of the order of 1012 neutrons/cm” sec. But, it was also consid-
ered useful because it was assumed that the tritium produced would be
bound chemically, as lithium tritide, within the Li-Pb. This is doubt-
ful due to the low solubility of tritium in Li-Bi which was determined
in this investigation. This study could also be relevant to some pro-

posed uses of Li-Pb in fusion reactors.

Li-Al Sorption System

 

The tritium sorption data in Tables IV and V, although not conclu-
sive, do provide some insight into the relatively complex nature of Li-Al.
The limited amount of data and the apparent inconsistencies make corre-
lations of temperature, pressure, concentration, and sorption rate
impossible. Tritium sorption rates were low, and equilibrium probably
was not achieved in many of the experiments.

The partial dissolution experiment does indicate that the loading
was determined by sorption rate rather than equilibrium, but it does not
explain the manner in which the sorption occurred. The tritium concen-
tration decreased as more of the total sample was dissolved, the concen-
tration being higher at the surface. Sorption may be controlled by

either surface reaction or slow diffusion, or both. Surface adsorption

could be very important if the solid blanket material were to "powder"
under irradiation; also, diffusion by grain boundaries could be signifi-
cant. The sorption time does seem to be several days. This indicates
that a desorption time would be also several days, thus increasing the
tritium inventory significantly.

The tritium solubilities observed in this study were low and in the
range of 1078 to 1076 atom fraction in Li-Al suggested by Powell (30).

Powell assumed that the tritium equilibrium solubility in Li-Al alloy
followed Sieverts' law; Sieverts' constant was chosen to be 4.47 x 10°
torrl/2 (atom fraction)™t at 500°C. Assuming that Sieverts' law is
applicable to Li-Al, Sieverts' constants were determined for the most
reliable data (most likely to be equilibrium solubility data) in Table
V. Figure 10 is a plot of Sieverts' constants for this data set, liquid
lithium (35), and aluminum (11) as a function of inverse temperature.
Sieverts' constants for Li-Al are between the lithium and aluminum data;
the slope of the line is in the same direction as that of the aluminum

1/2

data line. The value from Fig. 10 at 500°C is 3.h4 x 10" torr (atom

fraction) 1. Wiswall and Wirsing (43) found a typical value of 1.22 x
10% at 500°C; therefore, Powell's estimate of a Sieverts' constant is too
small,

Some of the data suggest that tritium inventories may not follow a
simple Sieverts' relationship, but this cannot be determined conclusively
from the present study. The tritium partial pressure readings were
affected by the presence of the stainless steel tube liners, which absorb

tritium throughout the experimental temperature range. Tritium solubil-

ity in stainless steel follows the Sieverts' relationship (28):

The stainless steel liners were necessary to prevent an attack of
the quartz containers. It has been reported (1) that Li-Al alloys with
a lithium content greater than 4 wt % (v 12 at. % lithium) form a sepa-
rate metallic lithium phase; however, the mass spectrometer experiments
did not verify this. The attack was probably due to excess lithium in

the Li-Al samples. Further thermochemical study of Li-Al is needed.

CHAPTER VII
ANALYSIS OF THE TRITIUM RECOVERY SYSTEM FOR THE
PRINCETON REFERENCE DESIGN
A Tokemaek fusion reactor consumes deuterium and tritium which are
injected continuously into the toroidal reactor. In the Princeton
Reference Design, about 10% of the fuel ions fuse and the resulting fast

neutrons are captured in the molten Li BeF) blanket. Tritium fuel is

2
generated from the lithium in the salt blanket. The principal coolant
for the fusion plant is helium gas, which cools the reactor and divertor
walls, as well as the blanket. Conventional water boilers then cool
the helium and produce steam which is used to drive electric power
generators.

Tritium must be recovered from the blanket and recycled to replace

that consumed in the plasma. Johnson (21) has proposed the tritium

recovery scheme considered in this section.

Description of the Process

Figure 11 shows the tritium recovery system for the molten fluoride

loop. The flow rates and concentrations are listed in Table VI.

The breeder salt recirculates constantly through eight disengagers
arranged in parallel about the periphery of the reactor. The salt is
sprayed into the disengagers as small droplets to provide an extended
surface area for the dissolved helium and TF to diffuse from the liquid
salt. Salt collects in the bottom of the disengager and flows back to
the reactor blanket. An unspecified doctor system removes impurities
from the Li BeF) and adds makeup agents to maintain the desired salt

composition to a small drag stream of salt.

The gas effluent is drawn successively through a water-cooled salt
trap and liquid nitrogen-cooled cyclic condensers. The helium is dis-
charged to a storage system for final control. Solid TF is melted out

of the offstream cyclic condenser and collected in a small receiver. The

salt flows intermittently through a purification system and into an

 

electrolysis cell, where a solution of KF in TF is electrolyzed to Fy
and I,. The gases emerging from the electrodes are saturated with TF
and must pass through the liquid nitrogen-cooled traps to remove the TF.
The pure tritium gas is recycled to the primary fuel loop.

The main components of the processing scheme, the spray disengagers,

and cyclic condensers were investigated in detail to evaluate their asso-
| ciated problems. The areas that may cause problems for the usage of

disengagers are: (a) the diameter and residence time of the droplets
 

 

 

a

\&/

L5

needed for adequate mass transfer of the dissolved TF and He in the salt,
(b) the ability to spray a molten salt in an evacuated vessel, and (c)
the characteristics of spray nozzles to disengage the salt. The possible
difficulties of the cyclic condensers involve (a) the effect of a noncon-
densable gas on the surface area needed for condensation, and (b) the
type of TF flow in the condenser. ‘These considerations were examined

to evaluate the salt processing system.

Disengager Analysis -

Figure 12 shows a detailed schematic of the proposed disengagers.
Each of the eight disengagers is equipped with spray nozzles near the top
and a salt discharge line at the bot ton. Baffles near the top of the ves-
sel prevent salt entrainment into the ‘vapors which are vented at the top.

To avoid wall embrittlement, the maximum tolerable tritium pressure
in the salt was estimated by Marconi (24) als 1072 torr or 1.32 x 1075 atm.
The corresponding TF concentration in the entering salt was calculated to
be 2.09 x 1077 mole fraction. The exit concentration corresponding to a
TF pressure of 107% atm is 1.29 x 108 mote fraction.

A simplified picture of the mass transfer mechanism in an individual
salt droplet is as follows: (a) TF diffuses from within the drop to the
surface of the drop, and (b) TF diffuses from the drop surface into the
gas phase. For the first step involving liquid diffusion in a spherical

drop, with negligible drag effects, the rate equation is (29):

tension is overcome (25). The effects of liquid properties and jet

velocity on the jet breakup have been studied for the case of atomiza-

tion without the influence of a surrounding medium. The mechanism can
be predicted to be dependent on jet diameter, jet velocity, liquid den-

sity, surface tension, and viscosity (Appendix D). From this correla-

tion, the jet velocity needed to achieve atomization must be greater than

488 fps to obtain a droplet size of 150 yu. From Fig. 13, the ‘residence

time for mass transfer for a 150-u drop is found to be 1.31 sec; there-

fore, a column height of over 637 ft is necessary. 4 smaller droplet
size would decrease the height of a disengager.

The selection of the type of spray nozzle has a considerable bearing

‘on the dimension of the spray tower. The characteristics, operating

ranges, advantages, and disadvantages for hydraulic-pressure nozzles and

spinning-disk atomizers are listed in Table VII. The maximum capacity

through a single nozzle or the feed rate from a spinning disk is about

10,000 1b/hr. The salt flow rate through each disengager is 5.0'x 10°

kg/hr or 1.1 x 10°

1b/hr; therefore, the minimum number of nozzles per
disengager would be about 110. |

A preliminary study of a dropwise liquid-gas contacting system was
made by Gabor et al. (16). Fused NeF-ZrF, containing dissolved uranium

tetrafluoride was sprayed into a fluorine atmosphere to recover uranium

hexafluoride. Experimental equipment was developed to test heat and mass

transfer rates. A Spraying Systems Company full-cone spray nozzle

(1/8 G3001.k4) constructed of Monel was used for the heat transfer tests.
This nozzle had a 0.026-in. orifice: The salt was heated to 650°C and
sprayed into air at 20°C. The average diameter for a droplet was deter-

mined to be 164 qn.

Several problems were encountered in spraying the fluoride salt.
Difficulties associated with plugging of the spray nozzle were solved
by heating the nozzle for fully controlled operation. In other fused-
salt process studies, autoresistively heated salt transfer lines have
proved successful. The nozzles used were removed and inspected after
20 batch sprayings. Examination revealed that the orifice had enlarged
from 26 to 32 mils, increasing the area about 50% and indicating frequent
nozzle replacement.

The prospect of a spray process for the recovery of tritium from
molten fluoride salt appears discouraging. The velocity of the Jet must

be high to overcome the surface tension of the salt for atomization to

occur with negligible gas film resistance or drag effects of a vacuum of
107% torr. The droplet diameter and residence time in the disengager
needed for mass transfer, coupled with the acceleration of the drops as
they fall, lead to a design of a tower of considerable height. If the
minimum number of nozzles if 110, the column diameter must also be large

to decrease coalescence of the droplets. The corrosion within the spray

nozzles would make frequent replacement necessary for full operation:

Cyclic Condenser Analysis

A schematic of the cyclic condensers is shown in Fig. 10. The
cooled helium and TF leave the salt trap and are drawn through an on-
stream cyclic condenser. The gas is cooled further to the liquid nitrogen
temperature of T7.4°K, and the TF is condensed out.

Ideally, the condenser walls must be kept cold enough to freeze out
nearly all the TF to a negligibly low equilibrium pressure. This would

expose the condenser surface to gas bombardment, so that the pumping speed

would be limited only by surface area and the sticking probability of the
impinging molecules (31). Noncondensables often influence the pumping
speed and the condenser surface area. The condensing gas is likely to
sweep the noncondensable gas against the condenser surface, creating a
blanket through which the condensing gas must diffuse to reach the cold
wall. However, gas blankets are not formed when the mean free paths are
long or when the proportion of uncondensable gas is sufficiently low (31).

Since an appreciable amount of helium, a noncondensable gas, is
drawn through the condenser, the mean free paths were calculated to deter-
mine whether a gaseous diffusion barrier would form. The mean free path
is the average distance traveled by a molecule between collisions. Mean
free paths can be determined from the collision frequencies of the inter-
acting molecules. The frequencies of collision of the possible pairs of
impacting molecules, the subsequent mean free paths, and the frequencies
of collision with the condenser walls are listed in Table VIII.

When collisions of molecules with each other are negligible in com-
parison with their impacts on the walls of the surrounding enclosure, the
gas is in Knudsen or "free molecular" flow. Knudsen flow usually assumes

3 401072 atm or a

very dilute gases with pressures in the region of 10
very narrow capillary tube. Also, the mean free path is greater than
the tube diameter for Knudsen flow of a gas (23).

As stated in Johnson's process design, the duct diameter must not be
less than 0.5 m to avoid large pressure losses. The mean free paths vary
from about 1072 cm to about 107 cm. The impacts of molecules with the

walls are in the same range as the intermolecular collisions; therefore,

it is difficult to determine whether the gas flowing through the

condenser is in Knudsen flow. Consequently, the helium may interfere
with the condensation of TF. An alternate condenser design, such as
using multiple tubes with smaller-diameter ducts instead of one 0.5-m
duct, may be a possible solution.

As stated in the proposed design, the heat load of each condenser
consists basically of the periodic heating and cooling of the mass of
metal (equivalent to 500 kg of steel) constituting the condenser. The
heat flux to cool the TF gas from 373°K to 7T7.4°K can be approximated
by summing the latent and sensible heat changes (Appendix H). The total

enthalpy change was calculated to be nv 132 kecal/hr; however, assuming

*
 

 

 

55

that the energy loss equals the decrease of the condenser temperature
itself from the melting point of TF (20°C) to TT7.4°K, the total heat
exchange duty per condenser is 1075 kcal/hr (Appendix H). Thus, the
freezing out of TF is a minor part of the heat load.

The cyclic condensers seem to be feasible as an integral part of
the tritium recovery system. Helium may increase the surface area
required to freeze out the TF; thus the condenser design will have to
take this into account. Since the cooling of the condenser itself,
rather than the heat flux of condensing the TF gas, is the main compo-
nent of the heat exchange duty, the total power requirement is not

increased unless there is an increase in the condenser area itself.

Other Design Considerations

 

The salt traps above each spray tower and the vacuum pump system may
be areas of additional design consideration. The molten salt entering
the spray disengagers at 660°C may be boiling, inasmuch as the uncer-
tainty is a factor of 10 for the reported values of vapor pressure for
molten Li_BeF) (4). The vapor pressure at 660°C of the molten salt is
determined to be 1.3 x 107% atm, and the total pressure of the vessel
is 3.83 x 107% atm. An increase in the quantity of vaporized salt in the
gas effluent would increase the salt trap size needed. The salt captured
in the cold traps may have to be reprocessed due to redissolution of TF
into the salt.

Tritium loss from the vacuum pump system will pe inherent; there-
fore, a trapping system should be a requirement to prevent the escape of

TF. In choosing the vacuum pumps, the compatibility of TF with the pump

components must be reviewed.

CHAPTER VIIT

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Conclusions

From this study, the following conclusions can be drawn:

1. The solubility of tritium in molten Li-Bi (vv 15 at. % lithium) is
less than 0.1 ppb at temperatures ranging from 500 to TOO°C.

2. Because of the low solubility of tritium in Li-Bi, the extraction
process proposed to recover tritium from a Li BeF) blanket is not
attractive.

3. Tritium sorption in solid equiatomic Li-Al ranges from 107° to 107°
atom fraction tritium, which is in agreement with estimates for the
blanket recovery system proposed by Powell (30).

4, The Sieverts' constants determined for the solubility of tritium in
Li-Al are smaller than those for aluminum, but larger than those for
lithium at 400 to 600°C.

5. The sorption of tritium in Li-Al appears to be controlled by surface
reaction, slow internal diffusion, or both.

6. The spray disengager process for the recovery of tritium from molten
Li BeF) does not look attractive for the following reasons:

(a) The velocity of the salt jet must be high for atomization
in a 107% atm vacuum (> 488 fps for 150-p droplets).

(b) The drop diameter and residence time needed in the disengager
for the mass transfer of TF leads to a tower of considerable
height (> 637 ft for 150-u droplets).

(¢) The minimum number of nozzles needed to atomize the amount
of Li BeF) to be processed per disengager is 110. Corrosion

within the nozzles would make frequent replacement necessary.
 

5T

Recommendations

For further study, the following recommendations are made:

 

1. Appropriate equipment design and sampling technique improve-
- ments are necessary to collect more accurate data for deter-
mining the physical chemistry of the Li-Bi——tritium system.
2. Removal of tritium from irradiated Li-Al of low lithium content
should be investigated to determine tritium solubility and
release rates.

3. Alternative flowsheets for recovering tritium from Li BeF),

2
blankets should be investigated.

THE COMPATIBILITY OF Li-Bi WITH Li BeF)

The equilibrium distribution studied can be represented by the

reaction:

BeF, (5a1t) + 2Li (py) = Be (py) + 2LiF( a14) » eq. 19
The equilibrium constant for reaction 19 can be.written as:

y y x2 v2
K = Be 'Be LiF LiF , eq. 20

where
K = equilibrium constant,
Y = mole fraction of component in the Li-Bi phase,
X = mole fraction of component in the salt phase,

y = activity coefficient referred to the appropriate pure solid
or liquid.

The change of standard free energy for reaction 19 is:

APPENDIX H

CALCULATION OF CYCLIC CONDENSER HEAT LOAD

The heat exchange duty of the cyclic condenser, as expressed in the
Princeton Reference Design (21), is the cooling duty of decreasing the
condenser temperature from the melting point of TF (20°C) to T8°K. Thus,

the total duty per condenser is calculated to be:

kcal (293-78) keel
2 [60 wp | 24 hr oo| - = 1075 5

 

where 60 keal

G equals the total thermal capacity equivalent to 500 kg

of steel.

To estimate the heat change required to cool TF from 100°C to -78°K,
the sensible and latent heats are summed as shown below. The heat “Sapa-
cities and enthalpy changes are HF physical properties (22,34).
