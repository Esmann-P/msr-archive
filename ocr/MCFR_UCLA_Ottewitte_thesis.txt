Configuration of a Molten Chloride Fast Reactor
on 2 Thorium Fuel Cycle

to Current Nuclear Fuel Cycle Concerns

by
Eric Heinz Ottewitte
Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering
University of California, Los Angeles, 1982

Professor William B. Kastenberg, Chair

Current concerns about the nuclear fuel cycle seem to center on

waste management, non-proliferation, and optimum fuel utilization

 

(including use of thorium). This thesis attempts to design a fast
molten-salt reactor on the thorium fuel cycle to address these concerns
and then analyzes its potential performance, The result features
1¢ A simplified easy-to-replace skewed-tube geometry for the core
2. A very hard neutron spectrum which allows the useful con
sumption of all the actinides (no actinide waste)
3s Reduced proliferation risks on the equilbrium cycle compared
{fo conventional fuel cycles because of the absence of car-
cinogenic, chemically-separable plutonium and the presence of
232 which gives a tell-tale signal and is hazardous to work
with

4. A breeding gain in the neighborhood of 0.3

1.0 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Overview of Current Nuclear Politics and Technology
1e1e1 Nuclear Fuel Cycle Problems and Their Politics

In recent years a number of concerns over the nuclear fuel cycle
nave arisen. A principal irritant is plutonium (Pu) production in the
existing light water reactor (LWR) uranium fuel cycle and in the fast
breeder (7BR) extension thereto. Concerned individuals fear that the
presence of Pu stockpiles mey promote the proliferation of nuclear
weapons, covertly or overtly, among national and subnational (ees.
terrorist) groups.

In response to this concern, President Ford announced that the US
would no longer consider reprocessing of LWR fuel to be a foregone
conclusion. The alternative of course is to stockpile or to bury spent
fuels, thereby creating a problem of actinide waste management. That
would appear to be less than an optimum ecclogical alternative as much
of the uranium mined (mostly 238 weuld never be used: mining trans-
forms mountain containing 10,000 parts of embedded uranium from natural
to machine —- processed state for the recovery of 72 parts fuel, Of
that, reactors consume 7 = 10 parts; a few parts change into plutonium
and the rest currently becomes other - actinide waste,

If commercial FBRs ever appear, the associated fuel cycle musi
2lso contend with higher actinides such as americium and curium. Heat
source rate and alvha decay toxicity may economically prohibit their
fabrication into fuel rods.

These and other concerms also influenced President Carter fo slow

dovm the plans for commercial FBRs.
1e1e2 Technical Solution: Thorium Fuel Cycle
The thorium fuel cycle solves some of these problems. By
starting with a material which is lower in atomic weight (A=232
vse 238) this fuel cycle eventually produces far less alpha-active
waste (especially carcinogenic and weapons-grade Pu) than the 238y/

233

Pu fuel cycle. Though U from the Th fuel cycle makes justi as

232

good a nuclear explosive, it is always accompanied by 1 whose

daughter decay products emit a highly-penetratinz gemma radiation.

This makes 233

U hazardous to work withe It 2lso signals its location
and transport.
1.1.3 Technical Solution: Molten Salt Fast Reactor

1e1e3e1 Advantazes of fluid=Tuel reactors. Fluid-fuel reactors
continuously add fuel and remove fission products and require no fuel
refabrication. Molten-salt reactors (MSR) have been more extensively
developed than other fluid-fuel power systems. They appear to offer
advantages in limiting the proliferation of nuclear explosives: the
fuel cycle inventory of weapons-grade material outside the reactor is
very small and concentrated at the power plants; little stockpiling
or shipping of weapons-grade fissile materials occurs.
1e1e3¢2 Iutroduction to the MSFR. Beginning shortly afier World War
II but extending into the 70's several laboratories looked at molten
szlt fast reactor (MSFR) concepts. Interest gemerally followed the
fortunes of the thermal MSR and so has waned in recent years, Through-
out this time, the inherent absence of cladding in an MSR has hinted
of a neutron economy sufficient for breeding,

A thermal reactor doesn't breed easily; it requires careful

design and continuous reprocessing to minimize nonproductive neutron
captures in fission products, core structural materials, and control
poisons. An MSFR is not so sensitive; it has no moderator and little
internal structure. Cl and limited alkali (typically Na) are the
lightest materials present, Therefore, the neutron spectum remains
fast and fission products absorb far fewer neutrons.

Numerous workers have already studied the MSFR(U/Pu) as a
breeder, fission product burner, and ultra-high, fasi-flux test
facility with very hard neutron spectrums This thesis systematically
examines the technical bases of IISFRs and extends MSFR studies into
the thorium fuel cycle, HSFR(Th), seeking 2 system which can maintain
criticality in steady-state operation without accumulating actinides
detrimentally.

The m/233y and the 22°

U/Pu cycles differ in their neutron eco-
nomicse As a result, interest in the thermal molten salt breeder
reactor (iSBR) has centered on its special usefulness for breeding on

the Th/>>

U cycle, Interest in the MSFR has focused on exceptional
breeding gain (BG) with the 238 on cycle [USFR (U/Pu)]: up to

046= 048s For an MSFR (Th) even with an anticipated reduction of 0.2
0e3y BG= 043=0.5 may be possible,

Though not usually emphasized, the very hard specirum and good
neutron economy of an MSFR offer the prospect of usefully consuming
all actinide products: sooner or later all the transactinides fission,
If some capture initially, that only (generally) further deforms the
nucleus, thereby increasing the probability of fission. Thus the MSFR
offers strong potential for resolving current concerns, particularly

on a thorium fuel cycle,
 

1e2 Historical Review of Molten Salt Activities
The history of the MSR is as old and complex as the history
of nuclear power itself, The ups and downs have followed those
of the parent technology but the swings have been if anything more
violent,

16241 American Activities

 

l1e2e1el Development of the MS3R: In 1947 ORNL began a stuiy on the
dhysics, chemistry, and engineering of v-aniume. and thorium-bearinz

molten fluorides, The potential for very hizh temperatures and power
density interested the aircraft propulsion project.

MSR technology first appeared in the open literature in 1957
(Briant and Weinberg[1]). Next, Bettis, et al, [2,3] and Ergen, et
ale [4] reported on the Aircraft Reactor Experiment: 2 beryllium—
moderated, thermal reactor fueled with a UF ,/NaF/ 2c, mix and con-
tained in Inconel, This reactor successfully operated in 1954 for
more then 90,000 kihr without incident, at thermal powers up to 2,5
MW and temperatures as high as 1650°F,

This marked the start of an ORNL program to develop a thermal
Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (SBR) for economic civilian power [5].
It included

1. Evaluating the most promising designs

2+ Pinpointirgy specific development problems

3s Developing materials for fuels, containers, and moderators

4+ Developing components, especially pumps, valves, and flanges

suitable for extended use with molten salts at 1300°¢
5. Developing supplementary chemical processes for recovering
valuable compcnents (other than uranium) from spent fuel.
6. Developing and demcnstrating the maintainability of an

MSE system.

In 1963, Alexander [6 summarized the Cak Ridge development:

1. i=: simplicity of the reacher core and the semicontinuous
fuel handling apparatus lead to low capital costs and in=-
creased plant avoiiability.

2. The simplicity and continuous nature of fissile and fertile
stream processing methods lead to negligible fuel cycle
ccsts in cn-site p-ants.

3, ‘The negative temperature coefficient of reactivity inherent
in the thermal expansicn of the fuel provides safety advant-
ages over other reactor cancepts.

L. The internally-cooled reactor offers competitive nuclear
performance; the externally-cooled reactor, superior per-

formance.

This effort Led to the design, constructicn, and operation of
the 8~illth Molten Sait Reacter Zxperiment (MSEZ). Critical operation
of the MSRE spanned the period from June 1965 to December 1969, dur-
ing which the reactor accumulated over 13,000 equivalent full-power
hours of operaticn and demenstrated remarkably high levels of opera-
bility, availability, and maintainability. --

In recent years, Battelle Northwest Laboratory (BNWL) has made
critical experiments on MSBR configurations [7]. Several United

States miversities have studied the chemistry of molten salts [8].
 

ANL. identified the need [9] for ine-pile corrosion testing at high burn
ups to clarify thc effect of noble-metal deposition on container metal.

Presently all work has stopped. A current problem was that
Hastelloy-ll limited the femperatures of the ORNL MSBR: the additicn
of carbides into the grain boundaries keeps He from forming and
swelling there,but at high temperatures the carbides disappear into
the grains. E. Zeoroski of EPRI feels that the problem with the
MSBR was whether the system parts would hold together very long [10].
142+1.2 Develooment of the NCFR, Goodman et al [11] proposed a
molten-chloride fast reactor (CFR) in 1952; Scatchard et al [12]
reviewed the chemical problems involved. In 1955, Bulmer et al,

[13] designed and evaluated z= 500 MWth [ICFR, externally cooled,

At that time the work was secret and only later declassified.
Chlorides of sodium, magnesium, uranium, and plutonium made

up the fuel sali. The blanket was depleted uranium oxide, cocled by
sodium, Their report contains numerous trade studies, some still
useful.

Bulmer chose chlorides over fluorides to limit neutron moder-
ation, However, he felt that the strong 33¢1(a,p) reaction would
require enrichment in et. M, Taube [14=16] of the Institute
of Nuclear Research, Warsaw shared this view, More recently both
Taube [17] and Faugeras [18] have mentioned that fluoride salts may

233

work well with U in a fast reactor in spite of the extra moder-
ation, The MSFR work then shifted to Argonne Nationsl Laboratory
(AVL).

E. Se. Bettis (ORNL) feels that [19] ORNL's look at the MCFR was
very superficial since it was outside their thermal reactor charter.
They mainly criticized the high fuel inventory tied up in the heat
exchanger, Bettis thought that M. Taube had a good idea in direct
cooling (im-core, no fuel circulation) with boiling Hg [20], but

that insufficient quantities of Hg exist. ORNL looked unsuccessfully
at molten lead direct cooling: corrosion proved ito be the Achilles
Heel,

In 1967, ANL summarized [21] the fuel properties and nuclear
performance of fast reactors fueled with uranium and plutonium tri-
chlorides dissolved in chlorides of alkalis and alkaline-earths,
Included were the physical and chemical properties of the fuel, and
the heat removal and neutronics for one homogeneous reactor and two
internally=-cooled reactors, The optimum core volume for 1000 MWe
power proved to be 10,000 liters for each types Each exhibited
favorable characteristics of high breeding ratio, large negative
temperature coefficients of reactivity, and low fuel-cycle cost.
However, the unattractive characteristics of large plutonium
inventory, large volume, complex design, and container material
problems indicated the need for a sizable program to develop the
MCFR(U/Pu).

Recently Le. E. McNeese [22] offered the following comments on
the CFR:

1s Resistance of Mo to salt corrosion seems to depend directly

on the oxidation states present, as expressed by the "redox"
potential, This corresponds to the directions of the Swiss

chemical research.
2. Re graphite vs, Mo as a structural material: graphite is
a step up in technology requirements. It is also subject
to radiation damzge., ORNL stopped the engineering on it
for MSBR.

3. Re in=core vs, out-of-core cooling: .inwcore offers lower
inventory (SI), but hish structural radiation damage. The
extra shielding for out-of-core is inconsequential. Though
the out-of-core (Pu) version oriers a breeding gain of 0.6
-0,7 to counteract the extra inventory, the economic mea~
sure of interest (at least for U/Pu cycles) is approx-
imately S12 36. n summary out-of-core will be easiest,
but may be less economic in terms of fuel costs.

Pission product burner concepts are of little interest:

only 129

I separation has been contemplated.

4, The Swiss molten chloride fast reactor designs presume that
a stream of about one ppm can be continuously directed for
reprocessing and returned. For this:

a. the chemistry exists (at least for fluorine
systems);

b. the engineering ability exists;

and

first, in Poland and later in Switzerland, looked at a variety of
IISR concepts, primarily on the plutonium cycle, Principal studies
were on

1e 4 system of about four fast MCFRs and one lSR "burner"

of fission product waste [23]. The overall system cone
sumes its own fission product wastes and still has a
vositive breeding gaine The burner feaiures a thermal flux
trap surrounded by fast reactor molten fuel. The higher the
specific power (IW/1 ) in the system, the lower the steady-
state fission product concentration becomes,

2, Optimization of the breeding ratio far an UCFR(U/Pu),

theoretically achieving 1.6 = 148 [24]

The 10 1m 1°" power density assumed by Dr. Taube far exceeds
the TO = 80xW 1 technology of ORNLe Thus, little direct ex-
perience applies, Still, L. E, McNeese (ORNL) was unable to
immediately foresee any intrinsic difficulty with 10 MJ 1! [22].

Presently, the Swiss work has stopped, as the electorate
pushes the laboratory from reactor research towards general energy
research and development,

1424242 France, In France, Comme Energ. Atomique (CEA) and
Electricite de France (EdF) sponsored development of the MSBR as
backup to the Superphoenix breeder, EJF emphasized lower powers
for near-term feasibility, Their long-term interests included
direct-contact ine-core molten=lead cooling. CEA pursued higher
temperatures for long-term application, Their near-term interests

centered on experimental corrosion studies,
 

Fonteray-aux-Roses (CEA) and Pechiney Ugine Kuhlman (PUK)
studied several high temperature MSR concepts [18,25,26], a
Th/ 233; cycle in fast and thermal fluoride-salt reactors and an
MCFR (U/Pu). The MCFR design features in-—cere cooling (Fig.
1.2-1) and a 7.62 oe) cylindrical core surrounded by a 30 wo
blanket, Table 1.2-I intercompares the main fast and thermal
Sr. ccnieepts of the French.
A CEA/FUK subcempany, SERS, and Carbonne-Lorraine [27]
carried out experimental studies in 1974-1976 including
1. Tests of the mechanical performance of the materials
under tempcrature and radiation
2, Corrcsicn tests in salt at high temperature
3. Cperation of loops at high temperature: ome fcr iso-
thermal hydrodynamic studies, a non-isothermal one with
small flow for heat exchange studies, and a third non-
isothermal one for corrosion.

In 1977, if the above results were positive, they were to decide on

a development program whose object would be the construction of
a prototype of 25 -= 50 Mith.

The American and French atomic organizations were also seek
ing to agree on the fields of preparation for a 200 Mie MSBR demo-
plant. They were to decide in 1979 on the: construction of this
reacior, depending on the progress with high temperature reactors
and success of the French Superphoenix 1200 MW(e) Liquid Metal
Breeder Reactor (LMFBR).

lhe MSFR interested them the most and they felt that such a study

would complement the US MSBR program. A preliminary study of a
fast system using the 2334 th cycle and fluoride salts did not
Look encouraging, so they refocused on a 23 8 /pu cycle and chloride
salts. Work on salt chemistry began in 1965; in 1970-1972 the
program extendes “c include other materials aspects.

Jarkers at Harwell and “infrith examined three variants of
© 25C0 Mie merr (2% /pu) [28-31]: in-core "direct" cooling by
molten lead drops, in-core ccoling by blanket salt passing through
Yo tubes, and cut-cf-ccre cooling.

The direct scheme encour tered too many proclems. The in-ccre
cocling cecncept appeared to warrant further study but the fuel
inventory did not appear to be as low as first thought; also the
high velocities and high pumping pressures presented serious
design problems. The corrosion limits and strength of molybdenum
or its alloys at reactor temperatures represented a large unknown.

With out=of-core cooling, at first the fuel inventory in the
reactor circuit was tco high. Hcwever, compact layouts and higher
(but still achievable) heat exchanger volumetric ratings reduced
it to within reason. Figure 1.2-2 illustrates the design. The
neutron flux was 3 x 1016 n en? 5 in the reactor and 3 x 1013

l1e2e3 Summary MSR State-of-the-Art

Both the 2 MWth ARE and the 8 MWth MSRE demonstrated ex-
tended successful MSR performance but under conditions less
strenuous than those considered for a 1000 MWe or MCFR. The
question remains: will a circulating-fuel system hold together
long enough to be practical? lore specifically, how will the
candidate container materials = Mo alloys, graphite, or compos=~
ites with these = hold up at high temperature to corrosion by
the variety of mutants and oxidation states which high burnup
produces? The answer ito such questions will come from in-pile
corrosion testing. The French have an on-going experimental
program in such engineering studies, but it may be proprietary.

Much work needs to be done in developing and scaling up
the reprocessing system.

With out-of-core cooling most of the fuel circulates
outside the core. This threatens the reactor stability. In-
ventory reduction requires compact layouts and high heat

exchanger efficiency,

2,0 ANALYSIS OF CONTEMPORY CONCERNS ABOUT THE NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE

AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING CHOICE OF AN ADVANCED CONCEPT

241 Muclear Fuel Cycle Waste Management

One primary facet of the nuclear waste problem is that reactor
operation induces short-and intermediate-lived radioactivity in
materials which had been stable or only long-lived radioactive, The
solution is to alternatively store the activated materials until they
decay, or to transmute them back into harmless stable or quasi-stable
nuclides, When operation produces nuclides which poison the enviro-
ment 2nd last long, then ecology prefers the added speed of trans-
mutation.

Fuel cycle wastes occur in preparation of the fuel (mill tail=
ings), reactor operation (spent fuel and activation of air and water),
and reactor decommissioning (activation products of strustural
materials). The latter are generally nonvolatile, bound up in the
structural material, and extremely difficult to release fo the
enviroment, even in accident situations, The mill tailings are in-
herently low-level, Holdup tanks and stacks with large dilution
factors manage ihe air and water activations, Management of the
spent fuel poses the major problem: all others pale in comparison,

In the absence of US reprocessing, spent fuel has accumulated
recently such as to saturate the utility storage poolse To prevent
loss of nuclear generation, DOE plans to find away-from-reactor
storage capacity for 810 MT of spent fuel by 1984 and at least
25,000 MT by 1996. Foreign spent fuel will add to these require-

ments [32]e

2.141 Characterization of Spent Fuel Wastes

Fission products and transmuted actinides emit most of the
radiation in spent fuel, Some of these radioisotopes exist for
long. times, comparable with a human life span. Those with half-
life of a few to 50 years are particularly hazardous because they
radiate faster than the longer-lived ones. How lang each element
remains in a human or animal depends on its biological-elimination
half-life, which may be very long.

Some half-lives exceed the life span of our society. A concern
then arises that nuclear power might burden the generations to come

with accumulated waste, part-cularly the transactinides (Figure

2.1-1),

2.1.1.1 Cases. Spent fuel gases generally include He and T, from

ternary fissicn, LOY Dy To and He fram charged-particles-cut thresn-—
cid reacticns, ard fissicn product gases (Xe, Kr, and I,). In either
a molten salt fuel or in disscluticn of a solid fuel, gases serarate

cut easily.

The IASA Code cf Practice for Safe Handling cf Radicnuclides
(34) classifies radicnuclices into fcur greups according to their
radiotoxicity per unit activity, primarily upen irhaiaticn. An HCPL
(Th) could produce the following nuclides in gaseous form (half-lives

in parentheses):

i. Group I (very high -adictoxiciiy): nce
2. Greup IT (high radiotoxdcity): S°CL (3x10°y) , =°T (8.C J,

L. Group IV (low radictoricity): -H (12.33 ¥), 2% (1.6x20Ty)

11?
BL (11.9 a), Pte (5.25 4).

Cf these only 34, 129, Bem, and 361 (in order of increasing
hazard) have half-lives long enough tc warrant processing: the rest

just require short-term holdup before release to the atmosphere,

Low hazard tritium relatively emits only weak radiation; its
maximum allowable concentration is amang the highest far any
radicactive material. Furthermore the body excretes it rapidiy and

it cannct bticlegicalily cencentrate in the envircnment, in food chains

18
or in man. It decays with a 12.3 years half-life to harmless helium
and thus poses no leng term hazard. It also has applicaticn for the

fusion prcgram. Nevertheless, it must be monitored and is hard to

contain.

8 .
Sm has a similar half-life but is far more toxiz. As an
inert gas, it is easy to isolate. Both 2%, and cL, gases
might be returned to the reactor as halide salt. There they will

most likely transmute to harmless Mea and L&%,.,

2.1.1.2 Solid fissicn products. Storage fer about a year (Fig.
2.1-2) reduces most fissicn product radioactivity to more manage-
able amounts. Cf the remaining radioisotcpes the most hazardous are
these which metabolize and beccme a part of living crganisas, and

decay with half-iives comparable to a human life-span.

2.1.1.3 Actinides. Management of actinide wastes has caused
much controversy in recent years [35-49], Their long half-life
makes actinides a quasi-permanent burden unless cne can transmute or
otherwise remove them from the enviroment, Alpha-emitters threaten the
most, particularly wien ingested. Plutonium is the worst of these:
inside the body it seeks cut and locates on bones, which makes it
carcinogenic. Section 2.1.1.4 discusses this further.

Most aétinides though usually in an unwieldy form can also

be used for weapons Section 2.2 analyzes this.

2.1.1.4 Unique biolcgical hazard of plutonium [50]. Most chemical
elements react chemically with biological systems, some of them
detrimentally. Cthers may be safe in elemental form, but not as
compounds. Individual isotopes can also harm living matter by emit—
ting dangerous radiation. All the isotopes of actinide elements
radiate. Plutonium predominates among these elements because it
comprises five quasi-stable isotopes and constitutes the first
significant element above starter uranium on the A scale.

The main isotopes of plutonium, in order of decreasing
importance are 23%, 240, 2hlpy, 2385, and 2025. This reflects
their usual concentrations and activity rates. In high-burnup
LMFBR fuel, Pu-241 presents the principel short-term hazard (Table
2.1-1). 239py emits 5.15 MeV alpha particles which range only
3.6 ct in air and less than b> pm in water. In each ionizing
collision with air or water molecules, the alpha loses 35 eV.

After about 120,000 collisions, it has lost all of its kinetic
energy. It then stops, captures two electrcns, and changes inte
a neutral helium atom. Noble gas helium does not affect the

human body.

Cutside the human body the alpha radiation poses no threat:
5.1 MeV alpha-particles can penetrate the skin from outside only
to a depth of b> pam. This is still within the epidermis layer
which regenerates very quickly.

The short track length of an alpha~particle in living tissue
concentrates the energy abscrption in a relatively small volume

thereby increasing its affect. Thus to compare toxicity of alpha

with the well-known results for X-rays one must multiply the energy
absorption for alpha-particles by the "Quality Factor", varying from
10 to 50.

The most dangerous situation arises ‘when plutaniua enters tae
human body. Alpha-particles can then penetrate into the tissues fo
a depth of 45 JAR Tissues generally are shielded by membranes,
but these are thinner than 1 fm.

As water ccmprises mcre than 70% by weight of human tissue,
the ianizing penetration prucduces hyd-ogen peroxfde tarcugh radion
ysis. Peroxide acts as a very streng poiscn inside living tissue:
through a series of chemical reactians it charges the struciure in
the enzymes wailch catalyze biochemisiry inside the living cell,
Prolonged irradiaticn by alpra-particles also deforms nucleic acids,
the carriers of genetic informaticn.

Cur widest experience concerning biolcgical effects of alpha
emitters is with 260,. Seventy years of handling suggests tnat
the body burden limit for occupatimnal expcsure tc it be O.1 MCL
(0.1 pel Experiments on dogs and other animals indicate that

Pu produces about five times greater biological effect.

Plutonium, like calcium, strontium, radium, and cerium, forms
non-soluble phosphates which deposit in the bones. For these elements

the skeleton is the "critical" organ.
Plutonium binds strengly to the sialprotein on the bene surface;
the most abundant comperient of bone, collagen, does not bind plutanium

to any significant extent. This localizaticn is what makes 239pu

23
Q
so carcinogenic. The lowest average dose rate of 23 ‘Pu in banes

causing death of rats from osteosarcoma was 57 rad (about 15 times
less than the lethal dose rate from spy.

In contrast thorium and uranium exhibit low radicactivity. Alpha=-
emitters 232% and 233y also endanger biological systems but they don't

"seek bones" like plutonium. This recommends a h/?3y fuel cycle
over a 238 feu cne.

2.1.2 Management of Spent Fuel Wastes

One can either store long-lived spent fuel wastes or transmute
them into non-hazardous products: those which are stable or near-
stable, or which shortly deccy into same (Figure 2.1-3). Studies
to date would transmute wastes in Controlled Thermonuclear Reactors
[52-55], the Savannah River Plant high-flux production reactors
[56,57], power reactors [56-60], accelerators [61], and others
[62-64]. Taube [23] and others [44] have shown that, of the trouble~
90 137

some radiation emitters, ° Sr and Cs most resist transmutation:
they have low cross sections ( ¢ 1 barn) for thermal neutron capture
transmutation into IL. and 138g, However, a thermal flux trap in
a fast molten salt reactor could provide sufficiently high flux to
reduce the effective half lives from 29 and 30.1 years down to 2 and
9 years, respectively [23]. A solid fuel reactor could not do this
because of technical limits on specific power.

Sometimes, the same properties which render an isotope hazard-
ous, also make it attractive as a commercial radiation source. 90s;

and DBs are examples. However, commercial demand does not threat-

en to exceed supply.

Actinide "wastes" accumulate when nuclides resist fission
ings Figure 2.1-4 indicates the prominent actinides of the Th
and U fuel cycles and their fission tendencies. More explicitly
Figure 2.1-5 shows that fission generally does not predominate over
capture until rather high neutron energies are reached. However,

« does exceed oO, for 23 hy at much lower energies than for other
actinides. Thus, a verv fast spectrur reactor, especially cn the
therium fuel ecvele can unicuely avaid accumulating actinides.

According to their median flux energies (Table 2.1-11), fast re-
actors must have many more neutrons above the Figure 2,1-5 crossover
points than thermal reactors. MSFRs which minimize neutron
moderation (elastic scattering) will have the hardest neutrcn
spectrum of all power reactors. Reactors with highly-enriched
fuels (Table 2.1-II) will also exhibit a faster spectrum: en-
richment eliminates from the core 23 & or 23 2Th, which primarily
undergo inclastic scatter.

In considering the reactivity contribution of each nuclide
note that the reactivity crossover point in Figure 2.1-5 where

a = VGe {Se exceeds 1, will occur at even lower energies

(roughly where Ss. =0.3-0.4). Thus, nuclides usually considered
as actinide wastes do not severely detract from criticality or

breeding gain potential in a very fast spectrum reactor.

24.241 Development of US Policy

US nuclear energy policy was from the first based on a keen
awareness of the dangerous aspect of nuclear electric power, The
Acheson=Lilienthal Report of 1946 saw a close association between
the civilian and military aspects of nuclear energy. It recommended
international ownership of nuclear explosive materials,

The related US proposai to the United Nations failed in part
because the Soviet Union would not participate, After that the US
withdrew into a period of secrecy. Eventually we became more relaxed
about the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and
abandoned the secrecy. Because we mistakenly thought civilian
reactor safeguards could be stretched to cover the more dangerous
elements in the fuel cycle — such as plutonium reprocessing - we
allowed plans for the use of plutonium to go forward unhampered.
There is where the damage was done [65].

In 1957 the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA was estaba
lished primarily to monitor the flow of commercial nuclear materials
and equipment among member countries, The charter advocates control
over "excess" quantities of plutonium, but does not restrict their
use,

The nuclear policymakers of the fifties and the sixties
apparently did not realize the security implications of easy access
to nuclear explosive material in national stockpiles. The prospect
of many nations possessing substantial nuclear explosive materials

seemed very far away, Also, nuclear weapons were thought to be

29
enormously difficult to design and fabricate. The US near-monopoly
on the technology, fuels, and equipment for civilian nuclear power
activities worldwide seemed to ensure US control of the situation.
Fledgling nuclaar power programs seemed to be unrelated to the devel
opment of nuclear weapons, The earlier prescience of the Acheson=
Lilienthal group that they had everything to do with it was ignored.

There was also some genuine confusion on the technical side.

T+ was once widely thought, for exemple, that you could not make
nuclear weapons with plutonium derived from spent power reactor fuel.
The Acheson=Lilienthal report seems to have misled many, including
the IAEA into believing you could denature olutonium. As 2 result,
many of those responsible for protection against military diversion
of plutonium were relying upon technological barriers which did not
existe.

On October 28, 1976, President Ford concluded that "avoidance
of proliferation must come before economic interests”s Therefore,
we should defer reprocessing until "there is sound reason to conclude
that the world community can effectively overcome the associated
risks of proliferation.”

Two factors contributed to Ford's decision and to the sub
sequent development of President Carter's non-proliferation policy.
The first is how the safeguards deficiency impacts international
security: we cannot control the plutonium or highly-enriched uranium
of other nations should they suddenly decide to abrogate agreements
and appropriate explosive material for weapons. At the same time

the extensive growth of the nuclear industry, worlduiide, is increasing

30
the availability of plutonium,

The second factor affecting current policies is the dubious
economics of reprocessing and recycle of plutonium in light water
reactorss This makes the early introduction of plutonium into
international trade as unnecessary as it is dangerous,

Presidents Ford and Carter both advocated that we restrict
access to dangerous materials, pause in the commitment to plutonium
separation and use, and search for alternatives to naiional stock=
pilings Their efforts to persuade our allies and trading partners
mct at best, with mixed success, It is hardly surprising that this
US policy shift on plutonium oroduced widespread irritation, alarm,
and even the cynical suggestion that the Americans were less inter=
ested in proliferation than in perpetuating a commercial advantage,

Both Britain and France have emphasized the security advantages
of their reprocessing plans, The British suggest that if reprocessing
does not relieve the accumulation of spent fuel, non-nuclear-weapon
states will have to develop indigenevus reprocessing facilities:
this will certainly pose a serious danger of proliferations Britain
argues that the best way to discourage this development is to confine
reprocessing services to the states which already have the bomb [66].

Carter subsequently submitted a bill, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Act of 1977. It would impose stricter rules on US nuclear exports
which would block their use for explosives, Opposition to this act
argued that whatever relationship exists cannot be reversed and that
it is so remote that further controls aren't necessary,

Sam McDowell of DOE Safeguards and Security has defined non-oro-

31
liferation as prevention of weapons capability in a nonweapons
state [67]. The goal of an alternate fuel cycle would be to deter
or reveal diversion such that suitable time would be provided which
allowed other countried to negotiate or induce that country to stop.

Zebroski of EPRI has suggested [10] that the primary objective
should be to seek improved resistance to diversion from civilian
power fuel cycles,

The heart of the controversy lies in the access to nuclear
explosive materials which the nuclear electric power indusiry pro-

vides, Section 2.2.2 discusses this further.

242.2 Relationship Between Nuclear Electric Power and

Nuclear Weapons Development

The U.S. generally produces plutonium for weapons purposes in
large special purpose reactors and separates it from fhe irradiated
fuel in government reprocessing plants. However, nuclear power
generation electricity also produces plutonium; commercial spent
fuel reprocessing plants will separate it, physically creating large
stockpiles, Also the same technolozy (and in some cases the same
plants) which enrich uranium for fuel can also enrich it further for
weapons use,

The essential point is this: getting the requisite explosive
material is still the most difficult and time-consuming item in the
initial production of nuclear weapons,* The operation of civilian
nuclear power reactors and plants for fissile fuel separation and/or

enrichment tend to remove this bottleneck, Then if a country has

32
prenared secretly in advance, it can quickly manufacture nuclear
warheads once it decides to do sa,

This is now a real threat, not present when the basic internat-
ional rules for nuclear trade were formulated twenty years ago. The
reason is that the civilian nuclear power indusiry has grown enorm=
ously, By any reasonable measure (the plutonium production rate or

the size of uranium enrichment facilities being utilized), it exceeds
! ——————

the sczle of the worldfs military nuclear orograms. In fact, in most
countries the quzntities of plutonium is spent reactor fuel, if sep-
arzted out and stored, will dwarf any plausible military needs.
2.2.2.1 Txtent of the svent fuel probleme Over the next decade Zurope
and Japan plan to send 3 Gz (1etric kilotons) of spent fuel tc Wind-
scale, La Hague reportedly will process about 6 Gg spent fuel for
Japan, the Federal Republic of Germany , Sweden, Switerland, Bel~
gium, Holland, and Austria, This means separating about 75 Mg (metric
tons) plutonium, or enough for about 10,000 nuclear weapons. Clearly
heavy financial investments ride on the cutcome: when transport
charges are included, the European contracts represent almost three
billion dollars in business. The intense international competition

pride, fends to obscure the proliferation threat,
2.2.2.2 Question of reprocessing. [32,65,66], Current U,S, policy
supports the relatively safe fuel cycle activities and discourages
the more dangerous ones. A primary U.S. imperative is to promote com=
mon rules for international nuclear trade, But before formulating
rules, much less implementing them, one mmst ascertain just what is
dengerous and just how such the spread of nuclear weapons threatens
individual countries and world security, Clearly a common understand-
ing does not yet exist, as witness US opposition to Buropean export
sales of plutonium reprocessing and uraninm enrichment facilities.

Recent U.S. Administrations have shunned reprocessing. Many
analysts [68] believe this directly increases the risks of both
diversion and proliferation, With no reprocessing, the increasing
amount of long=codled spent fuel, and the increasing number of lo-
cations with such fuel [69] increase diversion risks, The likeli
hood of "proliferation! increases because concern for a reliable
supply stimulates development of independent enrichment capabilities,

The capability to develop fissile production now exists in fifty
countries, with 10-20 additional possible in the next decade [10,717
A secure fuel supply and reprocessing service through international
commerce would economically discourage these countries from devel-
oping their own, The economic inhibition is substantial since initial
small-scale operations are highly uneconomic relative fo mature manue-
facturing and production capabilities in supplier countries,

Section 2,2,5 examines the vulnerability of different fuel

cycles to diversion,
Pe2e2e3 Attitudes on return of Pu, Of prime importance to pro-
liferation is the question: who gets the bred Pu: —the reprocessor
or the spent fuel owmer? If plutonium eventually displaces uranium
as the primary fuel for power reactors, how can indigenous repro-
cessing be successfully discouraged outside the nuclear weapon
states or a big suppliers club? The goal, long-sought by many,

of fuel "independence" does not equate to simply shifting fuel
dependence from the United States to Europe. These

commercial and political pressures, which earlier led to reprocessing
ccuid yet force Fu return even without adequate internaticnal
rrctecticn against preliferazicn.

Presently ncn-Iuratom countries need US permission beth to
transfer US-supplied spent fuel to cther reprocessors like Yind-
scale and La Hague and to get Pu back. Pu can return only "under
conditions that...warn the US of any diversion well in advance of
the time" diverted material could be transformed into weapons,
Ingland has pledged the material will be returned to its owners
"cnly in a form that will reduce the risks" of proliferation. In
his report en the ‘Jindscale inquiry, British Judge Parker took
refuge in time: 'this matter can be alleviated to some extent

by technical fixes", he wrote.

35
2.2.3 Which Reactor Fuel Contains the Least Proliferation Danger?

All reactors either produce Pu or 233, or start with fully-
enriched 23%. Thus weapons-grade fuel is intrinsically recover-
able from all reactor fuel cycles. However, which fuel attracts
nationalist and subnaticnal groups the least as a weapon? The
answer may depend on unraveling complex interrelated factors,

which are examined here.

2.2.3.1 ‘ieapons~grade material. For 233y or 23%, weapons grade
means isotopic content enrichment in U exceeding 12 or 20%,
respectively. In the broad sense weapons-grade means any material
which can undergo chemical separatiom to yield Pu or the uranium
enrichments menticned above. Thus dilution with any other element

including thorium does not lower the weapons grade as chemistry
can separate out the U again.

At one time it was thought that reactor-grade plutonium (pro-
duced in thermal reactors) was not of weapons grade [66], The U.S.
covernment has now stated unambiguously that they have produced and
successfully tested militarily important nuclear weapons, using
reactor mrade plutonium. Even simple weapon designs reliably produce
highly powerful (kiloton) explosions.

Similarly, the IAEA Safeguards Techniéal Manual now provides the
following cuidance: plutonium of any srade, in either metal, oxide
or nitrate form can be out in a form suitable for the namufacture of

nuclear explosive devices in a matter of days to weeks [65].

36
 

2.2.3.2 Unique “°U Daughter Radiation. All weapcns—grade fuel
can be left in a highly-radioactive state (by means of fission
products). The associated biological hazard would then discourage
its use by subnational weapon makers. Special national labor—
atories,could readily clean these up but ever-present 232; impur-
ity in 233; will continue to decay into hazardeus Y—emitters (Sec.
3.5.4). In less than a week after high level decontamination, the
233

gamma activity in recovered Th and U becomes so great that
fabrication by direct methods can be permitted anly an a scheduled
radiation dosage basis [72].

The characteristic har ‘-gamma signal of the®3 2 daughter

radiation also reveals the location and transport of this material.

2.24343" Preignition. The explosive yield of a fission bomb
depends on how long the imploded configuration stays together.
Multiplied source neutrons fram spontaneous 2L0,, fissions cause
early energy release which produces a premature disassembly.
This greatly rednces the' total energy yield of the devices.
Cansequently, a military might shun hizh burnup plutonium

(high in “*°pu), but a subnational group might still desire it.
In pure actinide metal only spataneous fission can con—

tribute copious source neutrons. However actinide compounds pro-
duce intrinsic preignition-triggers through (« ,n) ‘reactions.
Table 2.2-1 compares the typical activities from these neutron
sources. No Th/cycle isotope can match the 2405, spontaneous
fission rate. “°U comes closest in half-life (Figure 2.2-1),

but its concentration lies magnitudes lower. Thus the neutron

2424345 Denaturing and other technical fixes [32]. One technical
fiz, the Civex process, has received a fair amount of international
attentions It returns plutonium to the customer in the form of
fabricated fuel containing enough radioactive products to preclude
easy chemical extraction of bomb material. However, within a few
years after leaving the reactor, radioactivity decay forfeits this
protection, Since most spent fuel reprocessed in this century will
have cooled for even longer than that, the Civex process cannot
contribute to the solution of the problems we must worry about now.
Civex also must face other problems, Industry will resist
irradiated fuels because ther increase occupational and public
health exposures, Likewise the owners of the material, especially
foreign countries, are not likely to accept the dictates of the
reprocessor on the form in which plutonium is to be returned to
them, This would also argue against industrial recycle of solid=-

233

form “7°U daughters).

The simplest answer to denaturing the BG export from an MCFR
will be to take it directly from the core; fission products, Y =
emitters.and all.
202¢3+6 Summarys, It remains yet to say if there exist any signif-

icant proliferation differences among any of the fuels, We can

26244 The Significance of Stockpiles

2424461 Peaceful vs, military explosives, The Nonproliferation
Treaty forbids non-nuclear-weapon states to acquire nuclear explo
sive devices, whether labelled military or peaceful (they blow up
the same vay)e Peaceful explosive services could still be provided
under strict international physical control,

The same rules should apply to something very similar, a dis
assembled bomb, That being so, what about the nuclear explosive
material itself? The only answer consistent with the Treaty's

prohibition on nuclear explosive devices is = don't label it "peace=

42
ful" until you prove you can safeguard it [65].

2.2.4.2 What about unsafeguarded production reactors? [65]. It is
contended for example, that no country choosing to build nuclear
weapons would turn to its civilian power reactors for the requisite
explosive materials; to divert material in this way would risk detec-
tion by the IAFA inspectors, and in addition would provide too poor
a grade of plutonium to interest weaponeers, Under this self-serv-
ing theory, if weapons material is wanted, a special-purpose unsafe-
guarded reactor would be built, It is possible at the moment to do
this legally in countries not party to the Nonproliferation Treaty
and therefore not subject to inspection of all ifs indigenous nuclear
facilities. This underlines the need to extend the requirements of
the treaty io nonsiecnatory nations by conditioning ruclear trade on
acceptance of international agreements and inspection on all nuclear
activities within importing countries.

There is increasing pressure to do this, and a recent bill be-
fore the Congress would make this a condition for U.S. nuclear ex-
ports,

Even if legal, however, the construction of a special purpose
plutonium production reactor signals a country's intention to build
bombs and, in the present climate, risks premature interception of
its attempt to obtain explosive material for nuclear weapons.

To avoid interference, a country might stockpile serarated
plutonium from spent power plant fuel openly and legally, A de=
fense establishment can design and fabricate a bomb in privacy;

the illeeral activity is then confined to a swift, almost one

43
 

step process: appropriation from its storage place of the nec=-
essary plutonium, fabrication, and insertion into the waiting bomb.
It is surely the quickest, cheapest, and least risky route to nuc-~

lear weapons. So long as individual nations are permitted to keep

 

nuclear explosive stockpiles they are in effect, in possession of
an option to make nuclear weapons almost literally overnight,

In other words, from the moment spent reactor fuel is trans-
lated into sevarated plutonium and stored, the element of "timely"
warning, on which our present safeguards system has been relying,
evaporates, The same is true, of course, for stockpiles of highly
enriched uranium.

It is important to understand that so far as safeguards are
concerned a stock of nuclear explosive material is 2 lot more like
a bomb than if is like 2 reactor, No one would dream of suggesi-
ing that nuclear explosive devices, regardless of how labelled,
should be exported under international safeguards, The Nonprolif-
eration Treaty settled once and for all the notion that nuclear
explosives came in two categories - military and peaceful, Under
the treaty no such distinction is permitted. Yet strip away the
electronics and the conventional high explosives and label the
plutonium as intended for peaceful purposes and many nuclear spokes
man, at home and abroad, will isll you thai if subject to occasional
inspections it is a perfectly safe proposition: just like safe=
guarding power reactors [65].

The worldwide opportunities for diversion are clearly dominated

by the existence of large volumes of spent fuel stored in many hun-
dreds of locations, and especially long « cooled spent fuel which is
not returned to supplier countries [10],

The crux of the proliferation issue is not to completely avoid
Pu. Due to advanced technology, any country can produce it without
resorting to nuclear power cycles, Rather it is to avoid having
Pu lie around in larze quantities where diversion is less detectable.
In an HMCFR(Pu), Pu is always in solution, except for thai fuel which
is required to start a2 new reactor. Reprocessing is done within
the plant boundaries continously and the Pu then fed back into the

systems

2e2+45 Fuel Cycle Vulnerability to Diversion

The opportunity for national or subnational diversion of
weapons-grade material will depend on the size of the fuel cycle
inventory. Transport outside secure boundaries and decentraliz=
ation of the inventory enhances the potential for subnational
diversion: while under transport the material will be in a more
easy-to-handle form and probably under less security; decentrali=
zation also implies less security.
2.245¢1 Once=throush fuel cycle, Figure 2.,2-1 diagrams the trail
of weapons-grade material in a once-through fuel cycle, assuming
that the initial fuel elements are low-enrichment U., Affer gener-
ation in the reactor, it passes through about three storage/ queue
depots. Possibly one more storage depot labelled "permanent" may
appear later, once it is fixed what that will be. Only one out-of
plant transfer may be necessarye The inventory in the long term
storage depots will grow with time, eventually becoming very large.
Although the Pu there is not separated out, a national laboratory
could easily do soe.

One should also note the presence of the enrichment plant:
though it doesn't produce weapons grade-material for this fuel cycle,

it coulda

242.544 To reprocess or not to reprocess. The once-through fuel
cycle, starting with low=enrichment U, seems to display fairly low
vulnerabiliiy to subnational diversion, but creates a cumulating
stockpile available for national use, It also creates a long-term
waste management problem and poorly uses our resources.

The molten. salt fuel cycle clearly seems to be less vulnerable
than the solid-fuel reprocessing cycle, On the present rough scale,
the molten salt fuel cycle must be rated as comparable to the
"once=through" in vulnerability,

The question now occurs = would you export an MSR with its
in-plant fuel cycle capability to a non-weapons state? Or, a
different question: which would you export, the "once=through"
or the "molten" fuel cycle? Assuming that you could alter the MCFR

+o make Pu from 230

U but that also the non-weapons state keeps
its spent fuel from a once-through cycle (see section 2.2.2.3),
either cycle is bad for national proliferation, This seems to
say forget about exporting unless you can maintain control: IAEA,
US, or otlier,

On the domestic scene, the reduced market would definitely

favor the "molten" cycle as it solves more problems and makes more

fuel economically available,

50
 

242455 To breed or not to breed, Assuming that the potential
to breed excess plutonium or highly-enriched 233y exists, one
must next ask - should we? The alternative is to use the excess
neutrons fo achieve higher fission product levels, a smaller
critical mass, or some other benefit.

Breeding obviously provides initial fuel for starting up
other reactorse The altermative is {to start IHCFRs up with Pu
from spent LWR fuel, or highly-enriched 2354, But either of
the latter two fuels would make it easier to manufacture weapons.
Also they would cause the thorium fuel cycle in this reactor to
depend on the U/Pu fuel cycles With a system of thermal MSRs

the export 2334 BG could be diluted below weapons grade, but

238; diluent would evene

Th diluent is chemically separable and
fuzlly mean Pu production,

Based on these considerations, this study seeks a breeding
MCFRe Only the first generation of MCFR(Th) reactors should then
need 23% or Pu for startup.
2e2e5¢6 Fusion reactor vulnerability. Lest anyone think that
fusion reactors are the panacea, note that the current literature is
full of fissile breeding ideas, producing weapons-grade 233y or Pu,
In the US, current thinking regards such a hybrid as necessary to a

near-term economical reactor, In the USSR it is their prime goal.

51
2.3 Fuel Utilization

2.3.1 Earth's Hesources

Beyond 209g; (Z = 83) nature offers on earth only the chemical
elements thorium and uranium (Z = 90 and 92). Only these two
materials, in present, or feasibly-transmted form, can sustain
a neutron-induced fission chain reaction.

Only 0.72% of U is 3, The enrichment process loses some of
that. Present reactors, without recycle, consume just 10% of the
23% before assigning the rest to semipermanent storage. Thus we
presently waste 99.94% of the uranium mined, an affront io the en-
vironment. If, instead, the reactor could usefully consume ail of
the actinide, considerably less eyesore and mining expense would
result. Economics might then justify the retrieval of extensive
low-grade ores. At a time of energy shortage the present policy
seems foolhardy except that it reflects the restrictions posed by
economics, proliferation concern, and spent fuel waste management.
These must first be overcome.

Thorium abounds three times as much as uranium in the earth's
crust, and offers that much more nuclear fuel energy. The avail-
able uranium ores increase greatly if one includes not only the
classical ores ( »1000. ppm uranium) but the very abundant granites
with 80 ppm uranium and thorium, Granite is the main constituent
of the earth's crust (up to 20 km deep). Extraction from these
ores could become economical if fission reactors fully used all the
Th and U present. Together with fusion reactors, such a fuel cycle

would then open up all the principal world resources of nuclear fuel.

52
2¢3¢2 Use of Thorium

Nature has significantly inhibited the use of Th by not pro-
viding a thorium isotope which can sustain a neutron chain reaction.
Despite some unique advantages of a m/?33y cycle over a U/Pu one,
Th use must still prove its economics. A reactor which yields high
BG in the Th cycle would help a lot.

High melting points hinder reprocessing of a solid Th fuel:
Tho, melts at 3050°C; Th metal, at 1750°C. Breeding is very mar-
ginal, except with a fast reactor, Reducing non-productive neutron
captures (ee.ge to fission products, core structural materials, and
control poisons) becomes cruciale, That suggests fluid fuel reactors:
they can continuously remove fission products while adding fuel on-
line, and some variants require no core structure.

2.3.3 Intercomparison of Reactor
Concepts with Regard to Fuel Utilization

Much attention currently centers on optimum uranium usage by
candidate reactor concepts. The parameter of Megawatt days of
electric energy produced per mined metric ton of uranium (Mviae/
mined MTU) provides a suitable yardsticke Note that the numerator
includes energy production from thorium while the denominator ignores
thorium consumption, Consider as a benchmark that all the uranium
were somehow (ideally) consumed, Then without any energy production
from Th, the rating would be 380,000 Mvde/mined MTU, The advanced
concepts in Table 2,3-I, currently under study in the US, do not
come anywhere near this idealistic figure; not even when including

energy production from Th.

Zebroski [10] concludes that the evolutionary extension of
LWR burnup offers the best near-term hope for improving usage,
However, higher burnup will also produce greater statistical vari-
ations in fuel failure, which will limit these extensions, On the
long term, an MCFR should come much closer or exceed the ideal
limit because all actinides are consumed and it requires only thor-
ium feed (except for startup fuel on early reactors).

24344 Use of Both Th and U Reserves

One might desire that any new reactor concept be able to
operate on both the Th and U cycle, so as to eventually allow use
of all our reserves, MCFR siudies have already indicated large
potential breeding gains on the U/Pu cycle, providing Pu is accept-
able. In that event, ome could also supply spent U fuel as blanket

feed, thereby solving that waste management problem,

244 Strategic Security
Although it doesn't normally get public attention, still
sirategic security has its place on the list of contemporary concerns
due to current events:
le The lonz-and short-term goals of the USSR
2« Other political conflicts which could lead to world wer
(viz: Israel-Arab, China vs,.Taiwan or USSR, Arab-Arab, etc.)
34 The growing=-pains and frustration or have-nots and emerging
nations
4s The increasing political {urmoil and unrest within America
stemming from problems of cities, alienation of extremist
groups, and, again, have-nots,
It might be successfully argued that fat men don't look for
a fight = "yon Cassius hath a lean and hungry look", Then insecuriiy
traces to the failure-to-appear of cheap nuclear electricity, coupled
with the disappearance of the cheap oil-fired energy source, Thus the
world still hungers for a cheap abundant energy source to solve its
woes, We'd like to think the MCFR is it. Until {that becomes more
obvious though, it would be well to secure our US energy supply

from all threat,
2.4.1 Present Susceptibility

At present, US energy supplies, key to our might and resource-
fullness, are all above board (ground level) for everyone to see
and aim at. This includes dams, oil tankers and depots, fossil-
fuelled plants, and nuclear reactors. Actually only the contain-
ment building of the latter protrudes above ground but that still

leaves it vulnerable.

2e4e1s1 Subnational Blackmaile Should a terrorist group seek a
means of national blackmail, the threat of destruction to a dam
or a nuclear plant might seem credible.

Given sufficient explosive a dam would seem to be a better
target, both in size and certainty of wreaking financial havoc.
L¥R destruction would likely cause more personal injury. A fossil =
fuelled plant destruction would not necessarily threaten public
lives. Bombing a city or a poisonous gas (like ohlorine) plant

might pose the next largest threats.

2.4.1.2 Sabotage. In time of war or unrest, sabotage to our sys—
tem could rear its ugly head. Surprise attacks might often occur.
In addition to the above targets, one might then add many more none
nuclear possibilities such as poisoning water systems or destroying
any energy supply. For sheer havoc, though, destroying all water;

supply.to LWR cores as well as their containment would do well.

31
2.4.1.3 Har. In event of war, sabotage could be one front of the
attack. In addition planes and missiles might be directed at nu=—
clear plants in hopes of accomplishing what the aggressor didn't
want to or couldn't send an atomic bomb to do: perhaps an atomic
blast would have destroyed a valuable industrial complex whereas
an LWR core release will simply harm and demoralize a lot of

people.
2.4.2 Potential Remedy with an MSR

The dominant vulnerability of the above energy sources would
seem to be the presence of the potential hazard above or near the
earth's surface. Moving the hazard lower mitigates the danger.
Dams can't go underground. Nuclear power plants can, but it costs
a lot. An MSR uniquely offers

(1) Continuous removal of the principal hazard from the sys-

tem: the gaseous and volatile fission products. One can
store these far underground in a recessed tank for security.

(2) Ability to transfer the whole core further underground

at a moment's notice to a (possibly natural convection-)
cooled holding tank.
Thus the MSR may allow the security advantage of underground siting

without all the costs and other difficulties.

58
 

2elie Summar

Analysis suggests that an LWR may be a likely target for atiack
or threat of attack. The goals of such an attack would be

(1) Destruction of the energy production capability

(2) Release of gaseous and volatile fission products into

the air.

This threat to energy and peopie probably exceeds that from a
dam which tends to be located fartner from people. Also water must
follow the lay of the land, which authorities could observe and some -
what predict. Transport of fission product gases, they could not very
well.

At the same time, nuclear plants can be the toughest nuts to crack
as they are more compact and self-contained. With a little more hard-
ening, such as an MSR allows, they could be America's energy ace-in-
the hole and basis for survival.

On the long term the MCFR and all other novel concepts should be
explored and re-explored for their ability to provide that panacea of
a cheap abundant energy source - a far better means of dealing with

yon hungry Cassius than any protective shells one can devise.

2.5 Summary Design Principals for an Advanced System
2e¢5e1 Waste Management Restraints

Spent fuel contains several products whose activity remains
high after a years storage, Of these, the alpha~emitters can exten-
sively damage internals when ingested, Plutonium presents a special
hazard because it locates on bones: the whole skeleton of man bew
comes the critical organ. Although our society has learned how to
handle other toxic industrial wastes (arsenic, mercury, chlorine),
control is not perfect and accidents have occurred. Thus, we prefer
to avoid plutonium production if that does not severely curtail
our energy production, A reactor which usefully consumes all the
actinides and has nil Pu in its system would seem very attractive.

25,2 Non=proliferation Restraints

Despite earlier misconceptions plutonium of any grade can be
put in a form suitable for the manufacture of nuclear explosive
devices in a matter of days to weeks, Thus, from the moment a
non-weapons state separates plutonium from spent reactor fuel and
stores it, the element of "timely warning", on which our present
safeguards system relies, vanishes,

The same holds true of course for stockpiles of highly enriched
(in 2335 or 2357) uranium. Thus 2333 or 235y must be diluted with
238; to avoid classification as weapons-grade, However, subsequent
reactor irradiation again produces plutonium which separates easily
by chemistry. Thus no fuel cycle can avoid producing weapons-grade
fuel, Of course one can minimize the proliferation hazard by using

extended LVR cycles and noi reprocessing.

60
 

Both of the last two Presidential Administrations have suggested this
fall-back course, However, to get any significant improvement in
fuel utilization, reprocessing is necessary. Then one seeks to
minimize the {ranspor:i of weapons-grade and radioactive materials,
Molten-salt fuel cycles with in-house reprocessing offer low pro-
liferation hazard comparable fo that of the once~throush cycle,

2¢5¢3 Fuel Utilization Restraints

Kno'm nuclear fuel supplies contain up to 10! OGH=gaars of
energy, However much of this industry cannot tap because ores are
uneconomic to extract and the current reactor fuel cycle uses less
than onz cie=thousandth of that which it does extract. The absence
of any naturally-occuring "fissile' isotope puts Th at a further
disadvantage,

A reactor concent which could apvoroach full utilization of all
actinide fuel might stand a chance of providing the economics neces=
sary to accomplish the extraction of low=grade ores, including both
uranium and thorium for fission reactors. Such a concept should ex-~
hibit a high BG to overcome thorium's fissile disadvantage,

2¢5¢4 Strategic Security Restraints

Dams and current nuclear power plants provide attractive targets
to internal and external attack, !MSRs offer a hardening to such attack
by continuous removal of the major radiation hazard from the system and
ability to transfer the whole core further underground at a moments
notice, However, if an NCFR provided the break through to universal

cheap electricity, that should be the greatest advance to security.
2.6 Promise and Uniqueness of the Molten Chloride Fast
Reactor on a Thorium Fuel Cycle

The promise and uniqueness of this concept stems from the
molten salt state, the exclusive use of thorium, continuous repro-
cessing, and tne very fast neutron spectrum.

2ebe1 Advantages of the Molten State

Having the fuel in a fluid state allows out-of-core cooling,
thereby avoiding structural components in fields of significant ra~-
diation damage, It also eliminates labor and material costs asso-
ciated with fuel element decladding, dissolution, and fabrication,
Fuel handling oy pumps and piping should be less complex than solid
fuel handling. The simplifi:d core should greatly ease the plant
design, and increase its reliability and availability, thereby de-
creasing cost.

A fluid state system also facilitates on-site close=coupled
fuel reprocessing (Section 2,6.2)s Out=of=core cooling of the
molten salt allows the primary circuit to operate af low pressure:
+his reduces the severity of the environment and allows materials
such as graphite for piping. That should reduce fuel cycle cosis,

Elimination of fuel cladding and structural material signif-
icantly improves the neutron economy of the reactor: more neutrons
are available for breeding, reduced critical mass,or other tradeoffs,

The molten state allows high power densities (up to 10 MW
per liter) and high temperature operation while at low pressure:
fuel melting is part of the design and so is not a problem; fuel

vaporization does not occur until extreme temperatures, contributing

62
to low operating pressures, Only the contciner materials impose
temperature limits. With lo alloys 900°C appears to be an upper
limite Graphite structures should tolerate considerably higher
temperatures, This could significantly advance thermal efficiency
which could attendantly reduce thermal pollution of the environment.
Hizh temperature operation affords applications with existing

steam ‘echnolosgy, or with He secondary coolant for gas turbines

or process heat, High power density also promotes small sizes
which saves plant costs.

The eutectic nature of the halide salts facilitates low tem~
perature overation in the near term by minimizing chemically-reducing
corrosion problems with o~F2 alloys. With graphite, these problems
may not exist. Later, high temperature operation leading to higher
efficiency process heat ot compositions away from the eutectic nadir
can be implemented when more is kmovm about material corrosion,
Off~eutectic compositions can also mean higher BG and thermal con-
ductivity of salt.

Halide salts also offer superior thermal and radiation stabil-
ity. This inhibits the formation of other compounds, thereby preveni-
ing corrosion.

The molten nature greatly bebefits. safety as well: increase in
temperature causes a strong decrease in fuel density. The inherent
stability of this negative temperature coefficient will limit ex-
cursions, A self-regulating system may be possible, avoiding the
need for control elements.

The fluid state of the fuel also enhances safety under abnor-

63
mal condition through a combination of properties:
(1) Fluidity facilitates removal from the reactor to ever-
safe containers
(2) Hizh heat capacity of fuel restricts temperature rise
on loss of normal cooling
(3) Low salt vapor pressure mininizes the effect of any
fenperature rise
2.602 Adventazes Stemming from the Ixclusive Use of Thorium
The nuclear industry has exclusively used the uranium fuel
cycle to date, mainly because no "fissile" thorium isotope exists,
However, once a thorium cycle proves viable, numerous adventases
accrue. Because the burning of {thorium begins much lower on the
atomic weight scale than does uranium, little plutonium or higher
actinides accurmilate, The plutonium which does appear will be

38

mostly 2 Pu, a2 strong heat source which melts in concentrated form

unless cooled. That hinders its use as a weapon,

The predominant products in the cycle will be 232, 233p,,

233y, 2344, and 235, The only significant hazard associated with
these will be gamma radiation from 232; decay daughters, As the
ICFR concept requires no handling (as in fuel element fabrication)
this will be a plus; it prohibitedly hazardizes the construction of
Weapons,
2.6.3 Advantages of On-site Continuous Reprocessing
Reprocessing on-site minimizes the fissile inventory, environ-

mental hazard, and proliferation danger of the whole system: fuel

is not tied up in other plants or their temporary storage depois,

64
 

It is also not under transport to or from such locations, elimino~
ting highjacking, sabotage, and transportation accidents, Finally,
it never even occurs in a form or container suitable for transport,
except for breeding gain export,

Continuous reprocessing minimizes the fuel inventory outside
the reactor: the iaventory in the core, piping, and heat exchangers
reoresents almost the entire fuel cycle inventory, Continuous re-
processing also removes hazardous and neutron absorbing fission prode
ucts while adding fresh shim fuel from the blanket. This greatly
reduces the potential radiological danger of the reactor while in-
creasing the neutron economy. Processing on-line allows on-line
refueliing, That reduces do-mtime and obviates mechanical shim
devices, increasing the neutron economy,

2.604 Advantages of a Very Fast Neutron Spectrum

An CFR exhibits a very fast neutron energy spectrum: chlorine
(atomic weight A736) constitutes the lightest major element; the
salt contains only small amounts of Na (A=23) or K (4=39). Thus
no strong elastic scatterers pervade to moderate the neutron's energy.

Choosing a high molar content of UCl, in the core salt further

3
inhibits the neutron moderation, The principal moderating mechanism
then defaults to heavy element inelastic scatter, Feeding only
#301, (~ no ThCl,) into the core reduces even that relative to
fission,

Table 241-~II compared the median flux energy of the resulting

neutron spectrum to that for other fast reactors, Since the neutron

capture cross section decreases with energy and many isotopes ex=

65
 

hibit threshold behavior for fission (Figure 241=5), the hard spectrum
enhances fission over capture, The result is that
1. Reactivity per unit mass increases, decreasing the critical
size
2. More actinides now fission usefully rather than just trans-
mate into a higher-A actinide

3, The 233

U (n,2n) cross section for producing 32g, 2 pro=
liferation deterrent, increases

4, Parasitic neutron capture by fission products and structural
materials decreases, thereby improving the neutron economy,
and decreasing the sensitivity of those materials

233

S5¢ Both Pa and 234: tend more to fissione This eliminztes
the need to remove and hold 233p, for decay into 233y,

In 2 plutonium=fueled MCFR, the high actinide density,. the
absence of core internals, and the very fast neutron spectrum can
combine to raise BG up to CeTe A 233y/m system could probably
only achieve BG of 042 to 0e5s Should one prefer a BG near zero,
the good neutron econcmy can be diverted to other advantages such
as smaller blankets, slower fission product cleanup, added Th in
the core mix to reduce power density, cooling in-core, or operation
at (lower) eutectic nadir operating temperatures,

The fast neutron spectrum also implies low fission cross sec
tions relative to = thermal neutron spectrum, To accomplish the
same pover density as in a thermal system, the flux levels must

2 =1

exceed 10'8 ncm sec + The lack of core intermals limits ra-

diation damage problems in the out=of-core cooled MCFR, On the plus

66
side, such flux levels might benefit MCFR variants such as high flux
[75] reactors for molecular studies and radio-medicine prouuction [76]
and flux-trap burner reactors for troublesome fission product trans-
mutation [23].
24645 Spinoff Ability to Dizest Existing Spent Fuels
The MCFR should be able to usefully consume 2ll existing spent
fuels, In principle one could bring in spent LWR oxide fuel, declad
it (radioactivity makes this the most cumbersome step), coavert it
to chloride just like ‘fh and U (natural or depleted) oxides, and
breed it in the blanket region, That would, of course, mean pro-
ducing Pu. One might not want to export that capability and may
need to ensure that any expcritable MCFR designed for the Th cycle
cannot be easily so modified,
24646 Inherent Disadvantages and Limitations to HCFRs
Expected problem areas and concerns for an MCFR will be that
le Out-of=core cooling and local reprocessing produce high
fuel inventory in-plant; on the other hand little inven-
tory exists ouft=of=plant or in transport
24 lolten salt fuel transfers heat poorly compared with so=
dium in an LiFBR
3« The high melting point (~ 560°C) of suitable fuel salts
necessitates pre-heating in many places

one must increase the mass flow rate

3,0 CONCEPT DESIGN

MCFR(Th) neutronics will depend on the choice of reactor con-
figuration, method of cooling, power density, operating temperatures,
salt compositions, structural materials, and method of shim and
safety control, Section 2 provides directives for choosing: use-
fully consume the actinides, use thorium as feed fuel, and maximize
breedinge These all coincide with a supra-guide-line: keep the
core neutron spectrum as hard as possible, An intrinsic guideline
is technical and economical feasibilitye

by minimizing neutron moderation and leakage, Following subsections

3.1.1.2 Minimizing Heutron foderaticn. This translates to mini-
mizing neutron scatter, i.e. avoiding structural material in the
reactor and admixture to the fissile fuel. With separate core

and blanket zones, the core fuel should cecntain as high a frac -

tion of 23y atoms as possible for spectrum hardness. It also im-
plies keeping the core and blanket separate: mixing fertile and
fissile fuel in a single reactor zone such as in the MSBR moder-
ates the spectrum.

not react are rot yet lost from the reactor: they reenter the cere

and cuter blanket where they can further react or turn around.

blanket slow down, buf not all the way to eV energies, This recommends

an inelastic or a heavy scatterer more than a light elastic one for
the reflector material, This would also recommend a high actinide-to-
carrier salt ratio in the bli:znket,

Choice of beryllium as reflector material would: enhance the
outer blanket breeding through scattering and (n,2n) reactions.
However, beryllium is toxic, relatively scarce and quite light.
Graphite, in contrast, costs little.

Cu and Ni are well known for their ability to reflect fast
neutrons. Fe and Pb reflect almost as well and cost less. All
four qualify as inelastic or heavy—elastic acatters. However,
reflector studies in Section 3.5.6e3 indicate that with a
blanket thickness of 200 cm, the choice of reflector material
matters little. Then the low cost and low activation of graphite
should predominate.

Borrowing a page from fusion test reactor design, one could
reduce damage to the vessel with an inner liner. Neutrons

striking it change direction and lose energy; they are then less

critical mass actually matters little: the fuel utilization
issue pertains more to total cycle inventory while proliferation
deals with the availability of attractive weapons-grade or car-
cinogenic material, The fourth factor affects just the methods
used for survey calculations.

Three main designs come to mind in spherical geometry. The
first copies the thermal MSBR: . core and blanket materials, i.e.
fissile and fertile, flowing together homogeneously. The second
copies the usual breeder reactor: a minimum-size core surrounded
by bianket. The third adds an inner blanket (Figure 3.1-2).

Inherent disadvantages with spherical containers may be

1. Difficult fabrication of structural materials

2. Difficult replacement of structural materials

3. Stresses due to material curvature necessitating a

stronger, thicker core/blanket interface

Le Non=-uniform flow velocities in the core, possibly

creating additional stress.

lu
Cylindrical geometry offers choices similar to Fig. 3.1-2:
BG in (c) of Figure 3.1-6 may be slightly higher than in (b)
when the core fuel is all fissile and no fertile: BG in (a) will
probably be lower due to spectrum degradation. Likewise, re-
placement of the annular core (c¢) by near—equivalent-area tubes
(d) may further increase BG. Either each tube approaches
criticality or they approach each other in distance close

enough to avoid spectrum degradation.

Design (d) also suggests quick and cheap replacement, a
simple solution to the problems of radiation damage and corrosion
in the reactor. Structural tubes obviously produce no fission
products; if made of graphite, they also radiate no gammas. That
should facilitate their handiing and disposal. Graphite also
costs little. A design with straight tubes would limit re-

placement downtime. Design (d) is also easier to make and replace

than (c¢).

3.1.3.2 Choice of number, size, and spacing of tubes. Pro-
ceeding with the Figure 3.1=6 (d) concept, Figure 3.1-7 defines
some annular arrays of N tubes. The dotted-line circle passing

through the tube locates their centers. To minimize core spectrum

78
 

degradation tbe circle might be several mean free paths in diameter
so that most neutrons leaving the side don't reach tubes on the
other side. Alternatively tubes might abut one another so that most
neutrons leaving a tube either go permanently into the blanket or

directly into another core tube, To minimize siructural material, N

should be small,

Figure 3.1~7. Annular array of H=-tubes

A questior certain to 2-ise over core tubes is the interdeven~
dence of their neutronics ani kinetics. One prefers:either close or
near-gero coupling between them: intermediate loose-coupling could
lead to oscillations, not quickly damped. Behavior as independent
reactors (zero-coupling) would probably require multiple control
panels and operators, i.e. separate full-power cores sharing the same
blanket, This option might warrant attention as the tubes would share
the same reprocessing plant and other facilities as well without
affecting each other's operation. Since the reactor physics of each
reactor would simply copy that of a conventional core and blanket
reactor, this study will not treat it separately. Close neutronic
coupling implies physical closeness as well (separated by less than
one mean free path) and individually far subcritical, Then, shut-

down of one tube channel would shutdown the whole plant.

9
3.1.3.3 Location of tubes. To gain more insight into tube
location, consider again the annular core geometry of Figure
3.1-6(c). Fixing the reactor radius, Figure 3.1-8 depicts
designs with inner blanket (IB) diameter ranging from no IB to

no outer blanket.

 

Fig. 3.1-8 Designs with Varying IB Diameters

Pertinent metrics include breeding gain, medium flux energy in
each region, and critical mass. Section 3.5.6.1 shows that the
largest breeding gain occurs with no inner blanket. This would
correspond to placing the tubes adjacent to one another in the

reactor center.

3.1.3.4 Axial blanket and neutron leakage. Neutrons which leak
from the reactor cannot breed. They also require shielding.
Lengthening the core helps but an axial blanket stops axial
leakage best. Figure 3.1-=9 suggests scme designs which accom—
plish that by dampening the chain reaction in the tubes near top
and bottom of the reactor vessel.

The overriding concern in choosing between these designs

shouid be eases of making and replacing the fubes: otherwise one
must design for corrosion and high neutron radiation exposure.
The two skewed tube designs should excel in this regard because
the tubes are straight. The chain reaction in these would con~-
fine itself to prolate or oblute spherical geometries. The
critical geometry for the other three designs, would more
resemble a cylinder.

The next two designs exnibit large bends. Presumably, one-
would use straight pieces tc the extent possible and fasten them
to the bends, a cumbersome orocedure in a radiation environment.
The ballooned tube design presents even more difficulty to make
and replace. -

In conclusion, the use of a few (N=3 or 4) large skewed tubes
should present the least engineering difficulty in their fab-

rication, operation, and replacement. It will also minimize

neutron spectrum degradation and neutron parasitic capture.

32
3.1.4 Method of Reactivity Shimming

The concentration ratio [*33uy/[u + Th + FP] provides a
suitable though only approximate measure of the ratio of neutron
producers to neutron absorbers. As the reactor operates,
this ratio naturally decreases in the core, thereby losing reac-—
tivity. Replacement by a mix of higher ratio restores the
reactivity.

In Figure 3.1-10 the blanket breeds Byer, and the re-
processing plant separates it from ThCl, and NaCl (Section 3.7).
Addition of 4, Na or Th reduces uel, to UCL:

zi, + UCl, —= HCL + UCL,
Na + UCL, —a» NaCl + UCL

4 3

Th + 4ucl, ~~ ThCl, + 4UCl

4 3

The separated yer, should immediately mix in a shim tank with
highlyeradiocactive reprocessed core fuel (for non-proliferation
purposes). As shim mix flows into the core, irradiated fuel

passes out to the FP remover. If necessary, a ThCl, NaCl mixture

could be used to provide negative shim.

3els5 Summary Guidelines on Reactor Configuration

The first priority is to maximize BG. Hardening the core
neutron spectrum enhances the BG potential but not necessarily
the achievable BG. Hard spectrum also increases the fission
probability for all the actinides,

Spherical geometry maximizes BG by minimizing neutron leak-
age but presents engineering difficulties. It also limits the
power density: since critical masses are smailer in spherical
geometry, power densities rise. Varying the core length in
cylindrical geometry provides more choice in the critical mass
and power density. The spectrum remains hard.

One can also use multiole, small cylindrical tubes: some
spectrum softening occurs there, depending upon their proximity.
The optimum configuration may be a small number (e.g. three) of
skewed tubes penetrating a cylindrical tank. The effective
geometry of the neutron distribution will then closely approach

a sphere,

84
 

3e2 Reactor Thermohydraulics
An MCFR will require only low pressures for circulation and repro-
cessing removal, Much of the MSBR technology in thermohydraulics should

apply as well fo the MCFR.
3.2.1 Means cf Cooiing the Molten Salt Fuel

le consider three means of cooling molten salt fuel (Pig-
ure 3.2-1): cui-of-ccre heat exchange, in--corz heat exchange acrcss

tubes, and in-ccre direct contact with a secondary coclant.
1 7

3.2.1.1 OGOut—cf-core heat exchange. Here the mclten fuel flows
cut cf the core through piping to the external heat exchanger,
great.y increasing the sysi:m inventory. As 3 resutt, mcsi de-—
layed neutrons emanate outs.de the core. This affects reactor
control (section 3.6.2.2), and the neutrons activate the primary
circuit and its environs. The large fuel inventory might pena=-
lize the economics of a 22U-or Pu-based plant; for an MCFR(Th)
the penalty matters less because thorium abounds more, the feed
requires no enrichment or fabrication, and the plant achieves
near-fuil actinide utilization. Large fuel inventory also works

against non-proliferation goals, but not as seriously as if it
occurred out—of-plant in transport, reprocessing, or fuel fab-
rication operations.

The absence of structural material inside the reactor maximizes
the neutron economy and minimizes softening the neutron spectrum. The
high emphasis on these characteristics in Section 2 prompts us to adopt

this method of cooling for this study.

Nelson et al [21] examined two MCFR(Pu) designs with out~
of=core cooling: his main comment was an economical concern for
the large Pu inventory. Lane [78] mentioned out-of-core cool~
ing for a high~flux (10° n sec! on?) materials=testing fast
reactor. Winfrith examined at least four out~of-core cooling
variants. They recommended further study with both He and lead
secondary coolants.

Earlier Taube studies [79] concentrated on in-core conling,
Taube cautioned that loss of delayed neutrons out-of-core might
hurt reactor control. Later work emphasized out-of-core cocl-
ing to achieve high flux in burner and test reactors and high
BG in power reactors.

3.2.1.2 In-core heat exchange across tubes. Taube and Ligou [79]

yer, blanket salt

flowing through 23,000 Mo=alloy tubes in the core. A pump

 

analyzed a 2030 Mth MCFR(U/Pu) cooled by

stirred the fuel in the vessel to a speed of 2m/sec to increase
the heat transfcr. That much Mo meant large neutron absorption
(3.3% of the core total). The core inlet and outlet temperatures
were 750 and 793°C. A main question was the weldability of
the Mo=alloy tubes.

A Winfrith group examined [29] Taube's work,. They found
his breeding gains slightly high due to expected deficiencies
in the Bondarenko cross sections for 23 & and Pu. Also they
found the physical properties of the salt not to be as good
as what he used. These differences would increase tie maximum

fuel salt temperature to 1160°C. There one approaches limits of

87
of corrosion and of strength of ilo and its alloys, Taube has also
suggested tubes of steel-reinforced graphite.

Winfrith earlier studied the use of molten lead cooling but
limited themselves to an 800°¢c salt tenperature, Within that re-
striction they found poor performance, especially low BG due to
neutron absorption by heat exchange materials.

dith helium cooling, @infrith allowed the salt fo reach 970°C;
the outlet Je temperature was 850°C.

ANL studied two sodium~cooled MCFR(Pu)s [21].
3e2elel In-core direct-contzct heat exchange. Here an immiscible
fluid like molien lead [29], boiling mercury [20], or boiling AlCl,
[20] mixes with the fuel directly in the core, It then separates
out and passes out of the core fo a heat exchanger. “The direct con-
tact of molten fuel with molien coolant affords very good heat trans-
fer, elimination of coolant tubes (and cladding), and possibile ex~
traction of fission products.

The principal problems occur with mixing and separating the
fuel and coolant, and corrosion. The need for extensive research
to overcome these led to the abandonment of this method of cooling,
3.2.1.4 Blanket coolinge A Th blanket will generate little heat,
Constant bleedoff of the blanket salt (for reprocessing) and re-
placement by cold NaCl/hcl, may satisfy the heat removal require-

ments,

88
3.2.2 Power Density in an MSFR

3.2.2.1 Inherently high power density in MSFRs. The absence of struc-
tural materials allows high fissile fuel atom density. Absence of nau-~
tron moderating materials, and limited presence of fertile and carrier
salts keeps the spectrum hard. Together, these results produce high v|
(=96;/ 6, ) and small critical dimensions. To then produce the

same power as a thermal reactor requires high power densities.

3.2.2.2 Realistic range of power densities. No actual experience
with 1SFRs exists. ORNL considered power densities of 5-10 Md/
liter in a study of an MSFR fast flux test facility. Taube's MCFR
(Pu) designs range from 0.2 to 11.1 MW/l. British designs had 0.36
Mi/l.
CRNL operated a thermal molten salt reactor up to 80 kit/ 1.
Peak power densities in existing water-cooled reactors include 1.3, 1.5,
2.5, and ho4 Mi/l in BTR, HFER, ATR, and HFIR [78], respectively.
A coolant velocity of 120 ft/s might permit 10 MW per liter of core in
HFIR [78]. For the sodium~cooled fast reactors Melekes Cli-2, Phoenix
250, and FFTF, care power densities average 2.5, 0.46, and 1.0 Md /1.
The power per unit volume coolant for the sodium- and water-cooled
reactors above is a factor of two higher. Thus a peak power density of
10 Mi/L for a fast molten salt reactor does not appear infeasible, but
this study should not exceed it without good cause and a lower
one would present less engineering difficulty.
Flow velocity and heat exchanger size (i.e. cut=of-core fuel

inventory) may constitute the real operational limits.

89
 

3.2.2.3 High neutron flux levels and radiation damage in fast reactors.

The following integral expresses the power density:

=\ n
P(r) = | Pesca 5 db) @ (3.2-1)
where

P(r)

the power density at the point indicated by vector r,

. _ . ect
Nesceile = the atom density of the fissile fuel at r,
C ; = the fission cross section for the fissile atoms at r,
# = the energy-dependent neutron flux at r,

dE

the differential of the neutron energy over which the
integration is to occur.

Because OT £ is several magni+udes smaller in a fast neutron spectrum
than in a thermal one, g must increase that much to get the same power
density. MN fissile is also higher here, but that leads to small critical
volume and higher power density (Sectian 3.2.2.1) which makes @ even

16

higher. Because of high § (> 10°" n em ?sec™l), ancther limit to power

density could be radiation damage to structural materials (at theblan.
ket core interface),

The number of displacements per atom and the helium production rate
gauge radiation damage far intermediate and heavy mass materials. In
the past 70.1 MeV and > 1.C MeV fluence served as somewhat coarser (but
still valid) gauges. This emphasizes that most 21l of the newtroms in a

fast reactor cause damage wnereas many don't in a thermal reactor.

Coupled with the higher flux levels here, that bodes a limit to the life
of structural materials within the core environs. The solution there is
to periodically replace the skewed tubes.

Cut near the reactor perimeter the 2-meter molten salt blanket has

greatly reduced the flux in the pressure vessel down to ~ 1083 n cn?

90
s ~1, this gives a 30 year fluence of ~10%2 n fo for which much
experience already exists, Keeping the vessel exposure low is ime
portant enough to discourage the use of any regular arrays of solid
material in the blanket through which neutrons could stream.

3e2e2¢4 Impetus for high temperature operation. Heat transfers from

the core according to

g=n C, AT, (3.2=2)
Here
g = the heat removal rate = the heat generation rate under equi-
librium conditions
m = the mass flow rate, proportional to the fluid velocity (v),
density, and the flow area
C= the heat capacity of the fluid (energy per unit mass per unit
temperature)
AT, = the temperature increase of the fluid from enfrance to exit

of the core,

C5 and the density are relatively fixed; only v, the flow area,
and AT. can vary. Raising v would increase pumping power requirements
and corrosion. Increasing the flow area may dictate more ThCl, or
NaCl to avoid supercriticality: that, in turn would soften the spectrum
and reduce the BG potential,

With regard to increasing IP) Section 3,3 already requires inlet

temperatures of 550°C and higher, Thus an MSFR inherently generates

91
high temperature heat. This offers advantages (touted elsewhere) as
well as problems. The problems may include leakage through seal expan-
sion and melting of metal. Also, in numerous fused-salt systems, high
temperature gradients at equilibrium enhance chemical corrosion [80].
Thus, in short summary, increased heat removal requirements will

mest likely increase corrosion and/or soften the spectrum.

3.2.2.5 Adjusting vower density throurh critical mass. Section 3.5
sets the minimum critical voiume for an MCFR(Th) at about 60 liters of
0.06 we. For a 10 GWth reactor this would imply a power density of
167 ¥ith/l. Even for a 2250 !Nth reactor (1000 Mie) it spells 38 Mith/l.
The power density limits of szction 3.2.2.2 (10 i#1/1) dictate a larger
critical volume.

Cne way to get it is to increase leakage from the core (but not from
the reactor) by reducing the core dimension in one or more directions. 4
thin cylinder is one logical solution: above a given length-toediameter
ratio the length can infinitely increase without appreciably changing
k, re However, space requirements and return piping do impose practical
limits on the length.

Multiple thin cylinders resolve that dilemma. In regular array
(Figure 3.1-7) they approach an annular core geometry with internal blanket
(IB). As the IB diameter increases (annulus moves radially outward in

Fig. 3.1-8) the critical volume further increases.

92
 

In the skewed tube configuration the effective geometry (where
the tubes come together) can vary from one of minimal core leakage
when angles between tubes are equal and near perpendicular, to one of
high leakage when tubes penetrate the vessel top and bottom or from
the vessel sides (Figs 3e1=9)e

A second way to increase the critical volume would be to increase
neutron absorption by allowing a higher equilibrium concentration of
fission products. However, breeding zzin would suffer,

A third way is to increase the carrier salt concentration (de-
crease the molar percentage of actinide salt), However, this will
soften the neutron spectrum and decrease the BG potential, (This
would not decrease the BG proliferation hazard of the material: any
material which can sustain a chain reaction in a fast reactor, can do
so even easier in a bomb configuration,)

A fourth method is to add in fertile material, This will soften
the spectrum somewhat but without parasitic capture of neutrons, In-
deed, this option looks very favorable; section 3,3 discusses it

further.

93
3.2.2.6 Reactor design power. For a given power density, adding more
fuel (e.g. lengthening the core) can increase the total reactor power.
This should increase the economics since the capital equipment, include
ing that for reprocessing, changes mare slowly. However, two or more
small reactors at a plant may excel over ane larger ane: though each
cone requires separate instrumentation and operating crew, while ane is
down the other still uses the reprocessimg system and produces electric
power. Without significantly coupling the cores, the blankets of
sevaral reactors might also abut one another so as to eliminate re=
flector and enhance breeding.

A popuiar size for intercomparison of designs is 1000 ifve.

3.2.2.7 Reactor power distribution. Zonewise, fission of bred 233y
should generate more power in the blanket than high-threshold 232m,
fission would. The usual concerns regarding power peaking vanish: the

fuel is already melted, and burnup is homogenous due to liquid mixing.

3.2.2.8 Summary. The 2-meter thick blanket protects the vessel from
the high fluxes accompanying high power density. The frequency of
skewed core tubes replacement will still depend on the flux levels, In-
creasing the core volume therefore increases the tube lifetime, The most

constructive way to do that will be

(1) The use of multiple thin skewed tubes

(2) Dilution of the fuel with fertile salt

94
 

3,2.3 Primary Coolant Velocity

Section 3.2.2.4 pointed out that v, flow area, and AT, are the

only variables for removing heat from the core.

3.2.3.1 Maximizing velocity and minimizing pumping power, To maX-
imize velocity one desires as few bends as possible. Flow through a
sphere like Fig. 3.2-2, unless baffled somehow, would proceed more

slowly near the surface than through the middle. This could lead to
surface hot spots as weil us neck corrosion. The ideal ge-meiry for

maximum v would seem to be large-diameter pipes as described in section

3ele3e

Fig. ER 22

Typical Spherical Reactor

 

For constant mass flow rate the coolant velocity, v , will vary in-
versely as the tube cross sectional area. Pumping power increases as vs
for v {15 m/s, pumping uses 5 — 8% of the power. Friction losses in

small pipes will add to this. This recommends a few large pipes for

maximum flow velocity.

95
 

3.2.3.2 Corrosion dependence on velocity, How velocity affects cor-
rosion depends upon the corrosion mechanism which, in turn, depends on
the metal and its environment [80], For corrosion by activation polar-
ization (Curve B, Figs J.2-2), velocity has no effect,

Corrosion by cathodic diffusion does increase with velocity as in
Curve A/Section 1e Small amounts of an oxidizer, e.g. dissolved oxygen
in acids or water, czuse this, Easily passivated materials such as
stainless steel and titanium frequently resist this corrosion hetier at
high velocity: there the increased agitation causes an active-to-
passive transition (curve A, sections 1 and 2),

Some metals resist corrosion in certain mediums by forming massive
protective films on their surfaces, These differ from the usual pas-
sivating films in that they are readily visible and much less tenacious,
Extremely-high velocities may mechanically damage or remove these films,
resulting in accelerated attack (curve C)o This is called erosion cor-

rosion.

3424343 Velocities in similar systems, In an LMFBR core sodium
typically flows at 8 m/s. In the HFIR core, the coolant reaches
120 ft/s (37 m/s).

In theoretical studies, Taube [17,79] considered velocities of
10-16 m/s in the heat exchanger, choosing 14 n/s as optimum. The
British [29] varied v from 4~11 m/s in their NCFR heat exchanger. ORNL
designed an MCFR heat exchanger with a fuel salt velocity of 6.1 m/s.

3.2.4 Operatinz Temperatures

Numerous criteria will limit the primary circuit temperature,
Figure 3,2=4 illustrates the discussion.
3.244e1 Upper limits on fuel salt tcmperature, A high fuel sali
temperature could increase the feasible AT and thereby provide extra
heat transfer driving force, This would then reduce the needed inter-
mediate heat exchanger area, and therzto the external fuel inventory.
Temperatures above 900°C allow operation with He as the secondary
coolant, Even higher temperature would allow MHD topping cycles and
increased efficiency in conventional heat exchangers.

However, the temperature musn't exceed the salt boiling point or
cause damage to the piping material in or out of the core, Temperature
increases the rate of almost all chemical reactions, Corrosion fre-
"quently accelerates exponentially with temperature once past some
threshold value, Refractory metals such as Ho and Mo alloys have high
melting point and thermal conductivity and resist corrosion well,

With graphite piping, the fuel salt temperature limit might extend to

1500°C, (Melting points of graphite or Mo are much higher ,)

applications but warned of problems to be overcome.
3e2¢de2 Minimum fuel salt temperature. The minimum inlet temperature
must exceed the salt melting point with an adequate safety margin.
Although melting points of actinide chlorides decrease with transmute-
ion up the A-scale (Section 3.6.2.5), impurities also build in which
might raise the melting point through the formation of complex com-

pounds,

Table 3,3-VI suggests a minimum T of 650° to allow some

fuel
range in composition; addins a 50°C margin gives 700°C, For comparable
MCFR(Pu) concepts, the British chose 650-670°C; Taube used 750°C;

ANL, 625°C; OONL, 566°C.

3.2.4.3 Hinimum secondary coolant temperatures. Secondary coolant
salts with a variety of melting points are available, at least in
principle (Section 3410.1e1). In practice other problems and

properties may limit the choice, For process heal applications, the

secondary coolant temperature must be fairly high.

3e2e4e5 Restrictions on temperature differences within the primary
circuit, The maximum AT. within the primary circuit will be the
difference between core inlet and outlet temperatures, A similar AT,
occurs between heat exchanger inlet and outlet, MS3R experience in-
dicates that when

(1) The reaction between the fuel salt and a structural alloy

constituent strongly depends on temperature, and

(2) Temperature differs greatly within the circuit,

{then the constituent dissolves at the high temperature regions and
deposits in colder regions.

The scope of this study does not permit quantification of this re-
striction; however, the potential mass transfer does discourage going
far beyond the circuit AT, in similar reactor designs (below),

3.20406 [ AT, T] in other MCFRs, Figure 342-5 summarizes the results
of previous MCFR(Pu) designs, Taube's [17] and the British He~cooled
designs [29] are perhaps the boldest in using higher T's and AT's,
Many designs use a lower melting salt (with lower actinide molar con-
tent) to operate the fuel salt below 700°C.

3e2+447 Summary, Based on the above discussion, this study considers

(1) A minimum fuel salt temperature of 700°C

(2) A reference AT, = 200°C; advanced, 300°C

(3) A reference are® = 200°C; advanced, 300°C

(4) A reference LMID = 150°C; advanced, 200°C
The advanced AT's exceed those of earlier studies (except Taube's)

and are to be avoided if possible,

This shows that the fuel salt film coefficient controls the heat removal:
going to a thinner tube will not help much. The significance of lo
would be that it would allow a wider and thicker (therefore more relia

(MgCl, & NaCl) while this work presumes high actinide content. The wall

material k in the ORNL study was 6.5 times lower (80 Ni/20 Mo there vs.

3.2,6 Primary Circuit Arrangement
3e2.641 General Guidelines, Sections 2.5.4, 3+6, and 3.7 and 3.9
show the need for transferring the core and blanket fluids to remote
storage tanks, and flushing the primary circuit. Sections 3.6.2 and
3.8 emphasize minimizing the fuel salt inventory. Section 2.5.5
mentions the importance of reliability and plant factor.
3e2e542 Location of pumps and heat exchancers, Both pumps and heat
exchangers should closely surround the reactor as in Figure 1,2-2 so
as to minimize the fuel inventory in pipinge Shielding from core
neutrons, beyond that provided by the blanket, is not warranted as the
orimary coolant itself emits delayed neutrons. Placing the pump between
the heat exchanger and the ccre inlet imposes a lower operating tempera-
ture on it; this should lengthen its service and case its designe

3e24643 Parallel subchannels, As each tube channel (of N total) leaves

 

the core it could split into M>2 subchannels, each with a small pump
and/or heat-exchanger. Such redundancy should increase load factor

and safety of operation. Small size would also make it easier and
cheaper to build and replace the units, and easier to avoid criticality
outside the core, However, as the number of pumps increases, the chance
for a single pump failure does also, Thus the optimum plant load factor

could occur for a smaller number of pumps and/or heat exchangers.

113
 

Several alternate arrangements are possible (Figure 342-8). Plan
A schedules a single pump and heat exchanger for each channel, Plan B
splits the flow outside the core into >2 parallel paths, each with a
punp and heat exchanger. Plans C and D only duplicate pumps, Thus in
3; Cy or Dy 2 single pump failure does not terminate all flow,

Approaches A, B, and C differ significantly from the multiple cool-
ing loop concept of current reactor designs: the principal N loops have
no common container as in Plan D: each circulates independently. Plan
D probably is infeasible because of the

(1) Desire to compactize space so as to keep down the fuel in-

ventory (minimum piping per heat exchanger)

(2) Difficulty in avoiding a critical configuration

If a single pump fails with plan A, not only must that channel
flow cease, but the others! must also: the whole reactor must shut
down less the chain reaction continue to generate heat in the broken
channel as well as in the two good ones, In plan B or C, failure of
one pump again affects the whole reactor: the flow and power reduce
by 1/M in the bad channel and the other N=! core channels must also
due to the close neutronic coupling,

If M=2 subchannels in plan C represent regular and backup paths,
then each can handle the full flow and one is always ready in backup -
just need to switch a valve, Figure 3,2-9 shows a top view of such a
plen. Use of multiple (M22) subchannels especially for pumps, should
increase reliability and ability for reduced power operation, but may
also increase fuel inventory, auciliary heating, and friction (due to

added bends).

3.2.644 Tube channels in series. For a skewed core (recommended in
section 3.1.3.4) the inlet and outlet of a tube occur on opposite
sides of the reactor, To avoid excessive piping and fuel inventory
the outlet of one tube shouid connect to the inlet of another, which
lies vertically belows This means connecting all N channels in series.
Fige 342-10 attempts to describe this, It's as if someone ran a
needle and thread through a cylindrical cushicn; coming out the top,
the thread returns outside the cushion to another entrance point on
the bottom, This continues until the thread returns to the starting
position.

The series connection causes failure of one pump or heat exchanger
to shut down the whole system. But this does not differ from plan 4,
and one can still employ duplicate subchannels as in 3 or C above,

Pigure 3.2-11 shows a B-type horizontal M=2 design. Here the
tubes penetrate sides rather than the top and bottoms This should
simplify the reactor support and reduce the out-of-core inventory as
well, A physical model would be three pencils lying across each other,
penetrating an approximately-square cylinder of (blanket) jello.
3.24645 Summary. In the reference concent a small number of skewed
tubes connect in series, Alternate subchannels with pumps in each
could provide backup, but would add friction losses, On~line backup
(to avoid reactor shutdown) would also increase inventory and auxil-
iary heating. Keeping N to 3 or 4 should help the system reliability
as well as reduce the time required for repair and maintenance, It

also minimizes neutron spectrum degradation and parasitic absorption.

3.3 Choosing the Salt Composition

The abundance and low neutren moderation of chlorine make
sodium and actinide chlorides the preferred molten salts for fast
reactors on the U/Pu cycle (Section 1.2). Here we concentrate on

the thorium fuel cycle which could have different priorities.

3.3.1 Intrcducticn

The top concerns in chbosing the salt composition are neutran-
ics (especially neutron spectrum), chemistry, and meiting point.
Cther desirable traits are

1. Good heat transfer properties: high thermal conductivity

and specific heat cajacity

2. High boiling point to minimize vapor pressure

3. Adequate technological or laboratory experience

Le. Low fuel salt viscosity to minimize pumping ccsts

5. Low price and good availability

6, Non-toxic

33.1.1 Neutron spectrum. We desire as hard a neutrcn spectrum in
the core as possible, though not at the expense of BG. Since DOn-
fissile constituents mainly downscatter and capture neutrons, this
means maximizing the ratic of 233 to all other isotopes.
In the blanket, a softer neutron spectrum enhances neutron cap-
ture by the fertile material. Thus neutrcn moderators might help

there, if they don't absorb neutrens as well. However this would

not be good for an inner blanket as it would then soften the ccre

neutren spectrum.

120
If the core tubes were many mean free paths apart, then each
tube would individually approach delayed critical and have a hard

spectrum, but their coupling would be loose or near-zero.

3.3.1.2 Chemistry. Using the molten salt fuel as the primary cool-
ant of a nuclear reactor presents many novel problems in both reactor
design and system chemistry. The success of the CRNL Molten Salt
Reactor Program shows that it can be done at least up to their pow-
er levels. Experience there also revealed that the chemical states
often behave as if in equilibrium. This allows much progress towards
understanding interactions within the salt (chemical stability) and
between the salt and its envircnment (corrosion) since many of the
equilibria are grossly predictable.

The free energy of formation of the compounds, AG, measures
the chemical stability of the salts, specifically their ability to
resist forming other compounds which precipitate out. Taube has
deduced the temperature-dependent A G for salts of interest (Fig-
ure 3.3-1) [82].

Candidate reactants in the system which threaten salt stability

1. Atmosphere constituents oxygen, water, and carbon ‘dioxide
2. Structural materials (Section 3.4)
3. Fission products and other mutants
Radiclysis also affects salt stability.
Chemical corrosion involves several sciences (Fig. 3.3-2).
Physical chemistry and metallurgy describe the physical, chemical,

and mechanical behavior. Thermodynamics reveals the spontaneous

3.3.1.3 Eutectic melting point. Figure 3.3-3 depicts a typical
eutectic behavior: the mixing of two salts lowers the melting
point far below that for either salt by itself. The amount of low-
ering depends on the molar ratio of the two salts; excepticnally low
temperature is possible at the eutectic point, or nadir. This may
be of special value for the blanket region where little heat is
generated.

A fuel mix with melting point well below 700°C would minimize
auxiliary heating when shut down and allow a large temperature rise
in the core without reaching high outlet temperatures (> 1000°¢).

Low melting points of the compcnent salts also will facilitate their

initial dissolution.

For a mixture of salts Desyatnik showed [83] that linear addition

of the molar (specific) volumes of each salt

frm = LI wife]

gives densities high compared to experiment. Direct addition of
densities would give even higher errors, in the same direction. In
binary mixtures with carrier salts like NaCl, the maximum deviation

occurs at about 60 mole % actinide salt, A spot check on a 50-50

uct, /¥acl mixture at 1000K predicted F (50/50, 1000K) = 2,91 whereas
the measured was 2.8714 0.0024, Formation of complex salts, e.g.

3 XC1 + UCL, = K, UCL, causes this deviation from linearity.

3.3.1.6 Viscosities, Section 3.2.5 showed that low viscosity in-
creases heat transfer. Fizur: 3.3=5 displays the temperature-dependent
viscosity for individual salis [85,86] beginning at their melting
points.

The viscosity of salt mixtures is generally unavailable; Figure
3,3=6 does show viscosity behavior for two salt mixtures: first MgCl,
with NaCl [87]; then with ThCl 4 [88]. (Note that the two sets of pure
MgCl, measurements do not agree. The (latter) Russian work is partic-
ularly suspect because of other errors found there, Still the data are
informative here,) The bumps correspond to formation of complex
molecules,

Comparison of these diagrams with phase diagrams Figs. 3.3-7 and
3.3-28 suggests a correlation with eutectic effects which, in turn,
depend on complex molecule formation. In general it appears feasible
to choose a molar composition where the viscosity is close to the low-
est individual salt viscosity, Therefore, for ThCl,/Nacl, UCL, /Nacl,

ucl,/¥acl or combinations thereof we can roughly presume

3.3.1.8 Thermal conductivity, Figure 343-9 displays the measured
thermal conductivities of individual salts, all from Russian sources [91-
94]s Por other salts and salt mixtures, one must rely on phenomenolog-
ical models. Knowing rooa~temperature k for a salt does not help in
predicting k(T) of the liquid: Figure 343-10 shows how k changes with
temperature as a sali pezsses from solid to liquid state,
Gembill [95] proposed that two distinct mechanisms determine k
for fused salts:
1s Afomic or lattice conduction along the short-range atomic or
molecular order present in liquids

The usefulness of this formula depends upon the confidence developed
in it; Gambill had no data with which to test it. Attemots to fit
the available (Russian) date for individual salis fail drematically,
Inspection of the terms reveals the cause: K iomic (first term) nre-
dominantly depends on p7/° which has a negative T-coefficieat while
experimentally dk/dT is positives For Ks onic (second term) the \T
factor overrides the negative T-devendence in Py but only up to 2
certain temperature. Overall this aporoach fails.

Perry's Chemical Engineering Handbook [96] describes numerous
other formulae but these generally pertain to organics and other none
related fluids; also they either do not treat tenperature dependence
or they grossly disagree.

In Table 3.3-V the electrostatic~bonded alkali and alkaline

earth chlorides of intermediate and heavy molecular weight appear to

For highly-covalent UCL,, dk/dT = 0,0023 x MV (mdm) a magnitude

should be about -0.25 milliMatis/mek’,

The few measurements of chloride mixtures available — Rbe1/ucl,
and CsC1/UC1 g mixtures (Figs 33-12 and 3.3-13) [94] — show that k
fluctuates dramatically with molar composition, The oscillations may
correspond to the formation of complex molecules just as occurred with
viscosity data. This behavior suggests that one might yet achieve high
k =k(pure carrier salt), even for high actinide molar composition and
when k (pure actinide salt) is much lower,

Figure 3e3=14 compares Gambill's predictions to the above data,
with and without fhe single~salt correction factors from Fige 3e3=i1.
In most cases omission of the correction factor gives better agreement,

Note here how k very definitely increases with temperature: the
slope remains positive up through at least 60 mole % actinide salte The
average value of (dk/dT) /HeV from these six cases is 245 x 107° W/mK
(or 640 x 1077 cal/sec cm £2) in close agreement with the value of 2,3

z 107° /me kK’ for UCL, in Table 343-7.

In summary, Gambill's formula for X(T) proved successful with
fluoride mixtures. With chloride salts it appears to succeed vetter
with salt mixtures than with {the individual salts, Certain mixture
compositions should give a k comparable to that of the individual
carrier salle For the mixtures of concern here, the covalent actinide
chloride tends to control the femperature dependence of k: it varies
much less than the carrier chloride salt, To obtain high thermal con-
ductivity, both experiment (Figs 343-9) and theory (Gambill's formula

for high thermal conductivity) tend to favor salts with low Me In

Gambill's formula the factors Tp and Pup tend to cancel one another,

the fuel salt ard a softer spectrum in the outer blanket.

The CRNL MSR program shows that fuel salt circulation is feasible:
It is facilitated in part by lowering of melting points in
eutectic multi~component mixtures. Chemical stability and
corrosion of the molten salts are fairly predictable.

deat transfer depends on fuel salt density ( P) thermal
conductivity (k), viscosity (H)s and specific heat (Ce
PT), ph (T), and C, (Tp.p.) are well known for single salts;
much less so for salt mixtures. Knowledge of k (T) for mixture is
better, but still skimpy. HMojor uncertainties in predicting h. for 2

mixture should stem from all but P (Te

This study centers on Cl and F for which much literature exists.

use,
Jele2e1 Neutron moderating effects The halogen will be the principal
#1ight" material of the systems Thus chlorine (4=36) will produce a
much harder neutron spectrum than fluorine (A=19), satisfying a
principal core guideline, A soft neutron spectrum in the blanket may
enhance BG,

(Table 3.3-VI), which further recommends F for the blanket, Numerous

3a as 351 contrib~

workers have suggested enriching the chlorine in
utes most to absorption at thermal energies. However, despite the
fact that 30 has the low level density of a magic nucleus (J=20
neutrons), its S-wave strength function (7/0) and gamma width f{ will
be near the same at fast neutron energies, Thus no immediate evidence

exists that enrichment in will reduce the fast neutron absorption.

5r and I also show (Figure 3.3-16) systematically lower melting

points, but availability and physiochemical properties may limit them.

Section 3.3~1 mentianed how eutectic ternary mixtures can lower
the melting point even further. However secticn 3.3.4 shows that

significant lowering only comes with low actinide molar content.

3.3.2.5 Boiling point and vapor pressure. Figure 3.3-Z0 shows how
the vapor pressure for metal chlorides depends on temperature; boil-
ing occurs where the vapor pressure reaches che atmosphere. Core
salts with high beiling points will emit low vapor pressure at the

reactor operating temperatures. Tbis means low system pressure and

enhanced safety. Depending cn corrosian rates, it may also permit

the use of thin-walled (more efficient) heat—exchanger tubes. The
higher the boiling point, the greater the ultimate temperatures
which may be employed, Boiling points above 1500-1600°C would
allow maximum high temperature operation with graphite, Thus one
desires a carrier salt with low melting voint and hizh boiling point.
Since the eutectic behavior applies only to the melting points
these goals are not as contradictory as they first seem.

Comparing the boiling points of chlorides and fluorides,
(Fige 343-21) one concludes that generally the fluorides are less
volatile, especially for alkaline earths, Unfortunately the higher
melting points and moderating properties of the fluorides discourage
their use in the core. Should vapor pressure at desired temperatures

become 2 dominating problem, they could provide relief,

3.3.2.6 Chemical behavior. This section surveys the chemical
stability of the halides in the system (tendency to break up) and
their corrosiveness (tendency to chemically attack the structural

materials in the primary circuit at the temperature of concern).

Figures 3.3-22 compares the stability of some chloride and fluo-
ride compcunds: the lower the AG, the more stable. NaCl and LiF
ere particuiariy good. In general chlorides are less stable than
fluorides. This pattern of decreasing stability with halide atomic
number continues through bromine and iodine.

The small AG values for MoCl, end HoCly inhibit their fcrmation,
wich is wny Mo is a preferrei structural material in a chloride
system. Graphite also resists chemical attack (£armation of CF), and
‘cc1,) well. The appreciable AG for halides of Fe, Cr, and Ni makes
them unsuitable as structural material in contact with salt.

Chlorides generally dissolve in H,05 fluorides do not. Inside
the molten salt circuit the presence of oxygen or water will produce
oxy-chlorides (CCl) which corrode. Cutside the reactar, water solu-
bility may {facilitate cleanup of leaks or spills.

AG for other halides is less available; they are generally less

3e3e2s7 Cost and availability. The abundance of seawater provides
obvious cost and availability advantages for chlorine over Zluorine,
The scarcity and cost of Be for a F/Li/Be mix (necessary to achieve

low F melting temperatures) tilts the scale even more in favor of Cl.
3436248 Density. The power needed for pumping the core salt depends
directly on its density; heat transfer cz fhe other hand increases with

fluoride HSBR and chloride CFR (Pu) concepts are 3,2 and 31g cn
respectively, indicating little difference due to halide choice,

does not. Heavier halogens are less well studied, scarcer, and un-
necessary. I excels only in lower vapor pressure, In the blanket,
chloride costs less, melis lower, and is more chemically stable, but
fluorine, which moderates betfer and absorbs fewer neutrons, could
considerably enhance breeding in the blanket, The main problem with F

there is high melting point,

151
3.3.3 Choice of Actinide Chemical States(Stoichiometry)
This section assumes the use of Cl salts in the core, and Cl or

F salts in the blahket.

3.3.3.1 Actinides inherent to an MCFR(Th). Since only thorium crosses
the plant boundary as feed replacement material, the principal actin-
ides in the system will be Th and U isotopes with A=232-234. Pa, Np,
and Pu should total less than 1% (section 3.5.8.1). Pu starter fuel
in early reactors will produce some 4m and Cm bul {hese fission use-
fully. Later reactors will start a on bred 233g,
3.3.3.2 Melting and boiling points. In Figure 3.3-16 the melting
points for actinides in the -4 (IV) state clearly lie below those in
the (III) state. Eutectic mixtures tend to follow this frend, This
recommends the (IV) state for the blanket which generates less heat
and tolerates moderator much better (Sec. 3.3.1.1).

Few salt boiling points have been measured. As III-state melting
points exceed those of the IV state, boiling points should also. This

recommends the (III) state for the core salt.

3.3.3.3 Chemical benavior. uel, and uclL, can coexist in equilibrium.
In the core some UC, wirl pick up free chlarine to form uel, . By
itself uk, corrodes, but not when uci, predominates (i.e. when the
stoichiometry is near 3 Cl atoms to 1 U atom). ThCl, may be present
in the core as a critical mass diluent or negative shimming agent, or
simpiy be carried over in blanket reprocessing. It can also coexist
with ucl, without any deleterious effect.

Corrosion also increases with temperature. Temperature in the

blanket should be fairly low unless other conditicns warrant a high

158
melting temperature.

3.3.3.4 Choice between uel, and uel, in the core. Hard spectrum,
BG potential, and corrosion should mainly dictate the core com=
position. The higher uranium density and boiling point and

lower corrcsiveness of uci, far outweigh the lower melting point

of uw, .

3.3.3.5 Chemical states in the blanket. As a chloride, Th exists
only as ThCl, and can coexist with uCl, or UCl,. UCL, helps lower

L 4
the melting point in the blanket where little heat is generated.

159
3.3.4 Choice of Carrier Salt Cation

Slements which promise chemical stability and high boiling point
(Fig. 3.3-21) as a halide carrier salt include the alkalis Li, Na and
K, and the alkaline earths Be, Mg, and Ca. Inadequate data limit the
studies of the heavier alkalies and alkaline earths Rb, Cs, Sr, and

Ba. Pb is included because of interest generated by British studies.

3.3.4.1 Neutron moderating effect. The average lethargy increment
per collision § measures the effectiveness cf various materials as
moderators. At most neutron energies 5 5° spproxintes the group-
tise elastic downscatter cross section ( g “is the elastic scatter
cress secticn and MYL is the group lethargy width). The evidence
from § (Figure 3.3-23) and 505 /su (Table 3.3-TII) pretty such
agree: Li and Be moderate very strongly; Na and Mg, intermediate; X

and Ca downscatter the least; Rb, Cs, Sr, Ba, and Pb should also,

The choice of £1 (A=36) as the core halide (Section 3.3.2) en=
courages choosing a carrier salt cation (CSC) with A236: e.z. K or
Ca. This is not crucial, however, as Cl well ocutnumbers CSC in the salt
mixe

Inelastic scattering also degrades the neutrcen spectrum. The

znd Ca the mest (again); Pb and Na, the least.

3.3.4.3 Transmtaticn products. Neutron absorption can transmute the
CSC into markedly-different products. The law of energy conservation
fixes which channels the compound nucleus can decay into. All {(n, yy )
reactions are possible. Table 3.3-~X searches for others which have
positive % =values. Fig. 3.3-24 lists the cnes which also yield sig-
nificant transmutation products.

Li transmutes into tritium and helium, leaving a surplus of halogen.
Be activates to (1.6 x 10° year) 105, Na transforms into Mg, changing
the chemical valency of the salt system, The very fast neutron spec-

trum enhances (am, 2n) production of 2.6-year-radioactive 22a, Neutron

mutaticn of K produces long-lived radioactivity and divalent calcium.
The magic proton number of Ca causes the existence of numeraus stable
and quasistable Ca isotopes. These mostly transmute into themselves,
yielding nil radioactivity.

Rb produces long-lived 8%y and Psp plus considerable short-lived
radioactivity and different elements (especially Sr). Sr irradiation
principally leads to Psp,

Cs transmutation products appear innocuous. Ba will directly
produce gs. Protan-magic ”b will generally produce stable nuclei

3.3.4... Melting point. This section relies on the limited available
fusibility diagrams for salt mixtures [87, 100-122]. Most of these
come from terse articles in remote Russian journals; some disagree with
one another, This limits us to only qualitative conclusions.

Low core salt melting point helps avoid high outlet temperature

(e.g. > 1000 C). Figure 3.3-25 displays the approximate melting points
for ucl, mixes. Alkali chlorides tend to form lower temperature eutec-
tics with UCL, than do alkaline earth chlorides, The bumps signal com-
plex molecules like K UCL (3kcieuct,). Desyatnik et al [100] verify
that complex uranium groupings increase in frequency as the alkali~

cation radius increases,

Many of the eutectic melting points occur at low uel, molar content.

In contrast, hard spectrum and high BG potential favor high actinide

content.

Table 3.3-XI shows the possible uch, molar contents under various
temperature restrictions. RbCl excels for a 550°C limit; KC1 or RbCL
for 600°C. At 650°C all alkali chlorides show potential, though KCl
and CsCl excel. Alkaline earth chlorides don't work until the low temp-

erature limit exceeds 700°C.

If one wants a high-actinide 30 NaCl/70 UCL; mix then the lowest
core salt temperature allowable (with a little safety margin) is 750°C.
With a 50/50 kaCLAUCL, mix th: temperature can drop to nominally 650°C.

Section 3.3.1.3 mentioned that ternary and higher component mix~
tures can further lower the melting point. Figure 3.3-26 presents four
ternary diagrams for UCL,-ucl j~AkCL vhere Ak=alkali or alkaline earth.
Cne desires to optimize the ucL,/ucy, ratio so as to hold down temperature
(which affects corrosion) as well as the content of corrosive uct,
Keeping the U/Ak ratio high maximizes spectrum hardness and BG potential.
Unfortunately, the isotherms and the eutectic m.p. tend awey from hich
uci, content. Ternary mixtures with two AKCl components behave similarly
(Figs 3.3-27). In summary one must tradeoff low melting point (low
U-III content) and corrosion (high Ak content) against large spectrum

hardness and BG potential (high U-III content).

The blanket salt will generate little heat; therefore, a low m.p.
temperature will facilitate its handling. High hel, content maximizes

BG there. Carrier-salts whose eutectic mixtures with Thel, (Fig. 3.3-
28) seem to qualify are PbCl,, LiCl, NaCl, and KCl. They also form
suitable eutectics with the small amounts of uc, present (Fig. 3.329).
PoC, has a slight disadvantage in that Pb is divalent, further in-
creasing parasitic capture by chlorine.

Under an arbitrary operating design limit of ane U atom per 10
Th atoms and low 4k content (to avoid blanket power cooling and BG loss)
ternary UCL, /ThCl, /AkC1 (Fig. 3.3-30) mixtures do not significantly
lower the melting point: all eutectic points lie at high ueL, and

The eutectic points which minimize KCl content are 5.5 UCLy/45 uy, /
49.5 KCL for a m.p. of 314°C, or 17 UC1,/26 UCL, /57 KCL for a mp. of
518°C. With NaCl ane might opt for a m.p. of 339°C at 17 ve1,/
LC.5 uel, /i2.5 NaCl or 432°C at 21.5 UCL3/29.5 ucl, /49 NaCl. The CaCl,
ternary offers no attractive eutectic points.

None of the above points have ucl,/uc, > 1; that could spell
corrosion troubies (Sect. 3.4e2.2). Still, temperature affects cor=-
rosie as well, so that high uel, could yet be worthwhile. Of the

five cases mentioned above the mix with m.p. 339°C locks the best.

‘Ternary mixtures of TF / UF, / AF behave like their chloride

Mixing in two carrier salts with ThE, doesn't help either (Fig.

ThF, or UF, to reach melting points of 400~500°C, but only at 124

3.3.4.6 Chemical behavior. Halogens react vigorously with the al—
kali metals to form a very stable binary compound. Salts of alkaline
earths also exhibit large free energy for formaticn (Fig. 3.3-12).

Fb halides are not so stable: ORV". [13] found PoCl, to react with the

structural materials available then. They z2lso found ZrCl to cause

2

a snowy drecicilate.
In addition to having high melting points, alkali halides conduct
electricity in the molten state, and otherwise behave like electro-

valent compounds. With the excepticn of lithium fluoride, they readily

dissolve in water.

3.3.k.7 0Cest end availability. NaCl is very abundant and cheap. This
reduces both direct capital and fuel cycle costs; it also allows other

options such as substitution of fresh for radioactive NaCl.

3.3.4.8 Density. The densities of the principal (lighter) candidate
carrier salts (Table 3.3-XII) differ little compared to those of ThCl,
UCl,, and uel, .

Due to differences in molecular weight, a 50-50 molar mix of
actinide and carrier salt means about an 85-15 weight mix, respectively.

Thus the actinide salt density controls the final density.

In Table 3.3-IIT, the lighter chlorides offer the higher specific

in the 700-900°C range. CsCl is an exceptian.

chlorides,

A FC! including the density factor 0 (Figs 343-35) aczin
discourages only the heavier alkaline earth chlorides, CsCl and F4Cl,
look very good then.

In summary, LiCl, HgCl,, and NaCl lock to be the most attractive,
in thz% order. SrCl, and BaCl, the least. This study is not conclu-
sive, however; as ii generally does not include the effects of actinide

cnlioride admiziure.

3 NaCl/ 2 MgCl, mix based on the:eutectic point between these tro,
However, as pointed out above, the advantage of a second carrier
salt disappears when the actinide salt predominates.

Similarly, ORML in 1963 [6] and ANL in 1967 [21] reported
studies on carrier salt mixtures of NaCl, KCl and MgCl, but with
only 30 and 18-50% mole of actinide chloride present, respectively.

Taube [17] generally assumes NaCl alone as carrier salt even
with low actinide contents. He mentions also further study of
NaF/ZrF5, but Section 3.3.2.9 precludes F from the core. The

British [29] also choose NaCl by itself.

3.3e4.¥1  Supmarv, Table 343-XIII summarizes the” intercomparison of
carrier salt cations. The goal of keeping the core spectrum hard dis-
courages use of Be and Li there because of elastic downscatter; Ca and
K dovnscatter the least. Na undergoes the most inelastic scatter; Ca
and K¥, the least. Parasitic neutron capture though small, exceeds by
magnitudes for Li and K over that for Ca, Mg, and Ma. Ca transmutes
the least into radicactivity or troubiesome chemicals.

Cation choice on the basis of eutectic melting point depends on
the range of acceptable actinide molar contents. Boiling points far
carrier chlorides play no role as they far. exceed those for actinide
chlorides. . The chenical stability of the alzali chlorides (NaCl and
XC.) surpasses that of the aixaiine earth chlorides (rigCl, and CaCl).
NaCl abounds by far the most in nature and costs the least. Salt density
affects pumping power needs but the higher densities of the actinide
chlorides dwarf any differences due to carrier salt choice. The light
alkalis transfer heat the best.

In summary, FMaCl costs little and exhibits good physical and
chemical properties. K and Ca feature better nuclear properties for
the core salt but the much higher Cl concentration obscures them. Na
and 1 look best for the blazket sali. Final choice must weigh these
relative advantages plus the location of eutectic melting points near

the desired actinide molar fraction.

3.3.5 Choice of Helative Proportions of Actinide and Carrier Salt .

In the core we want to avoid nuclei which neither fission nor breed,
but only dovmscatter and capture neutrons. This means maximizing the
fissile enrichment and the ratio of actinide~to~carrier salt. It is
also important to maximize the fuel salt heat transfer coefficient at
an average fuel temperature of 800 -850°¢; h, comprises the parameters

foi ) oy and k (Section 3.2.5).
3.3.5.1 Feutrcn physics of the The) UCL, ratic in the core mixture.

Considerable ThCl, inherently resides in between the core tubes as
blanket salt 2nd interacts. neutronically with the core. ~ However, as

a first approximation, Section 3.5.1 ignores that modelling heter-

,

1!

ogeneity as well as that of the multiple core tubes. Thus the ThCi
UC, ratio here refers solely tc that within the primary loop.
The addition of hel, to the core salt mixture should
1. Markediy increase the critical core radius, thereby decreasing
the power density. This causes
a. the core flux level to decrease, which
(1) extends the life cf the core tubes, and
(2) decreases the damage flux to the vessel, which ex-
tends its life
b. the primary coolant power density in the heat exchanger to
decrease, which
(1) decreases out-of-core fuel inventory
(2) eases heat exchanger stresses
2. Lead to an optimum Th/U ratio where the primary circuit fis-

sile-inventory is a minimum. The 1956 ORNL study [13]
 

obtained a similar result

Je Increase internal (core) breeding, which
ae reduces the necessary size of the outer blanket
be reduces the import of a reactor
4. Soften the neutron spectrum, which
ae decreases the BG potential of the reactor
be inhibits the useful consumption of higher zctinides
ce nullifies z small part of the flux decrease from the
dilution because the average fission cross sections
become smaller,

In swanary there are both pros and cons re Th presence which are
difficult to quantify on a ccmmon basis, However, qualitatively, 3G
potential and the useful consumption of the actinides argue for low
Th concentration {[Th]) while [Th] ——== 0 could mean too frequent a
replacement of the core tubes, Practically, reactor operation could
start with high [Th] and wide tubes and later change to low [Th] and
smaller tubes as confidence in the tube wall life develops. This ver-
satility would probably require only the inclusion of a few extra tube

ports in the reactor vessel,

3e3e5.2 Density. This study principally involves UCL,, Nall, and

3
ThCl,. NaCl molar content may vary only between 30 and 70% to achieve
eutectic melting point lowering. Figure 3.3-36 shows the density for
various ThCl,/UC1, ratios using the densities and the prescription ror
their addition from section 3.3.1456

For a PuCl,/2 uc1,/3.16 NaCl mix, Taube and Davudi [123] listed

p= 2.92 g/cc at 850°C; for 15 PuCl,/85 NaCl, 2 = 2.12 g/cc. These
values both seem low compared to Fig. 3.3-36 (though different
actinide salts are involved), In the same report these authors quote
F = 3.526 g/cc for a 1 Pucl,/2 UC1,/3.65 NaCl mix at 850°C, which
seems nigh.

The 1963 ORNL paper [6] listed a density of 3,08 g/cc at 649°C
for a 45 NaCl/25 XC1/30 (Puc, + ucl,) mix. Since density decreases
ith increasing temperature, that value supports Figure 303-36. The
earlier 1956 ORNL study [13] used P = 245 gfcc for 2 3 NaCl, 2 HzCl
1 (uel, + PuCl,) salt, which also seems consistent.

For a 1 Pucl,/2 UCL,/3465 HaCl mixture, Taube and Dawudi [123]
assumed a much higher iL = 0,05 (1=0,001(1~850°C)). Similarly, at
649°C OmIL used 0,0662 + 0.0080 for a 45 NaCl/25 KC1/30 (ue1, + PuCl,)
salt in 1963 [6] and 0.10 for a 3 NaCl/2 MgCl,/ 1 (uci, + PuCl,) salt
in 1956 [13]. However, neither Taube nor ORIL indicate any experi-
mental basis whereas the HM recommended here is based on recent
(Russian) measurements [124-125] This reduction in sLby more than

a factor of three increases h, by roughly 50% over previous studies,

1 Pucl,/2 ucl,/3.65 ¥aCl mix at 850°C they used a rather high value of
0.24 cal/gm C. This agrees better with the 1963 ORNL [6] value of
0e3+ 0.03 cal/gn’C at 649°C for a 45 ¥aCl/25 KCL/30 (ue, + PuCl,)
mix and the 1956 ORNL [13] value of 0.2 cal/am’C at 649°C for a 3 Nacl/

Although they admittedly contain large uncertainty, at least Section

3e3e5.7 Choice of core mix. A pure fissile fuel would produce
the hardest neutron spectrum but an MSR requires carrier salt
admixture to reduce the melting point. Adding fertile salt
to the core mix helps reach BG potential by reducing leakage
through increased fertile capture, but it also lowers the BG
potential by softening the core neutron spectrum. Another
consequence will be to increase the critical mass of fissile
Fuel and the core size, This will be good for power density
(Fig. 3.5=15) and in~core to out-of-core inventory ratio (for
control purposes), but there are limits to economical plant
size.

An alternative to fertile fuel in the core is to increase
the size of the outer blanket. However, this also increases
the size of the overall reactor system.

The ORNL/56 design limited the actinide concentration to
17 mole precent actinide chloride. Of this, 2/3 of the actinide
was fertile material. The prime motivation was to keep the
liquidus temperature below 500°C, to avoid what were then exotic
structural meterials.

The British [29] chose an actinide molar concentration of
30-437) the French [23], 30%,following the earlier lead of ANL [21],
The. reasoas for these choices are not clearly stated. However, we
suspect they include ~. | -_

le Keeping the power density low

2. Keeping down the plant fissile inventory

3. Improving the thermophysical properties.

This study assumed 70% for most of the physics analyses so as to
 

fully explore the advantages of a hard spectrum: power density is
reduced by using a geometry with high surface/volume ratio and limited
fertile fuel presence (limited reduction in enrichment)s By and large
ihe enrichment problem is ignored because all fuels have weapons capa~
bility but 232 bearing 233y, the least so, The better thermophysical
properties from higher carrier salt content are sacrificed for the sake
of the highly~desirable hard spectrum and attendant high BG potential.
3ele5e8 Choice of blanket mix. Since {the blanket generates little
heat, it can avoid high temperatures. This should

1. Preclude corrcsion of the reactor vessel

2. Allow more choices for the reactor vessel material

3s Reduce auxiliary heating needs

Por low temperature operation the salt composition should lie
near the eutectic point(s), but on the side high in actinide content
for high BGe The French and Swiss MCFR(U/Pu) designs assume 65% uct,
and 35% NaCl; the British, 40% UC, and 60% NaCle For a NaCl/ucl,
mix the eutectic point occurs at about 65% NaCl; for NaCl/ThCl,, at
about 70% NaCl. We assume here a 65% TaCl, and 35% NaCl, KCl, or

3435.9 Eutectic mix for flush salt. Section 3.9.5 proposes flush
operations for removing residual radioactive salt in core and blanket,
The best mix for this purpose would probably be the eutectic composi-

tion of the blanket feed: with the NaCl/ThCl system, any mix between

4
25 and 50% NaCl would be good (Figs 343-22).

3e4 Structural Materials

To find materials of suitable strength and endurance one must
anticipate the environment and the response of materials to it,
Environment includes radiation, temperature, pressure, fluid compo-
sition, chemical additives, condensation, and vaporization. iHaterial
response depends on mechanical strengths, metallurgical phases, and
chemical interactions (corrosion).

Requirenents on the material will include suitable {thermophysical
properties, 2bility to fabricate and weld, product availability, and

existence of pertinent experience for the material.

3.4,1 feneral Ccnsiderations and Criteria

Jedelel Plant-life economics, Initial study usually suggests several
economical materials. The meterial cost is important, but the true
installed cost depends also on size, pipe schedule, system complexity,
joint make-up, fabrication techniques, and labor rates, Downtime and
life expectancy, functions of the material response, will affect the
ongoing maintenance costs, Fortunately, metals usually have xnown
corrosion rates,
3.4.1.2 Corrosion, general [80, 126]. The most important engineer-
ing task is likely to be finding materials which resist corrosion by
fuel and blanket salt mixtures containing fission products and other
impurities. This may require a trade-off with system conditions such
as lowering temperature, decreasing velocity, or removing oxidizers,

Alternately one might sacrifice some corrosion resistance

for higher strength; also, the best material might not be readily

available, The most desirable material will probably combine

202
 

moderate cost with reasonztle life. Sometimes the environment condi-
tions change with ftime: The structural material must handle that or
be changed also, mxperimental loops under similar reactor opercting
conditions are thus invaluable: they allow one %o examine actual cor-
roded pipe, valves, and fiitings.
Hany factors can affect corrosion, some of which may be obscure,
The questions below help in evaluzting them:
le What is the composition of the corrosive fluid?
2. What is the concentration (specific gravity, pH, etc)?
3, What is the operatinz temperature and pressure?
44 Is water present ai any time?
5 Is air present, or is the opportunity for air-leaks high?
6 Is the system ever flushed, rinsed, or drained out?
Te Is a slight amount of corrosion objectionable from a contam-
ination standpoint?
8s Has any specific trouble or problem been experienced with
certain materials?
9. ‘hat materials are being, or have been, used for valves
and fittings?
104 What were the comparative lives of the materials used?
11+ Are there special fabrication, handling, or installztion
problems?
12, What is the estimated installed cost or capitalized cost
for the projected life of the piping?
Metallurgical structure markedly affects corrosion resistance:

fortunately it can often be altered, Physical chemistry and its

203
various disciplines are most useful for studying the mechanisms

of corrosion reactiens, the surface conditions,of metals, and other
basic properties.

3elele3 Corrosion by electrochemical attack rao]. Under chemical
attack, metal ions leave anodic areas of the surface and enter into
the solution, thus dissolving the surface. This creates an etched
affect. In the solution they chemically react with other elements
such as oxygen, chlorine, etc, to form nonmetallic compounds; plateout
of these darkens the suriace with z= protective, passive film. Examples
include rust om irom, oxide layer on aluminun, and "passivation" of
sizinless steel by immersion in nitric acid.

While they remain intacs, such films generally protect the metal
or at least retard further degradetion, However, high stream veloci~
ties, vibration, and thermal shock can all break the film continuity.
The pickling of pipe to remove mill scale illustrates controlled coz=
rosion by direct attacks

Galvenic action, or bimetal corrosion, exemplifies another common
mechanicme Two dissimilar metals establish an electrical potential
when they contact, or connect by an electrical pathway, in the presence
of a conducting solution (electrolyte).

In bolted joints, such as pipe flanges, the relative sizes of the
anodic and cathodic areas become important. An anodic area that is
small in relation to the cathodic area accelerates the corrosion.
Where flanges and bolts are dissimilar metals, the boliing metal

should be cathodic to the flange metal,

204
 

Jedeled Corrosion protection [80, 126]. The means of reducing
corrosican include

(1) Use of corrosion-resistant metals and alloys

(2) Protective coatings such as paint, electroplating, etc.

(3) Cathodic protection by the use of a sacrificial metal

higher in the electropotential series

Impervious graphite = for handling hydrofluoric, sulfuric, and
nitric acids ~ has some temperature znd concentration limits, It is
unsuitable for use with free bromine, fluorine, and iodine, as well
as chromic acid and sulfur trioxide, Normally, its porosity makes
graphite unsuitable as a piping material; however, various resins
used as impregnants will produce ar impervious material, The pipe
manufacturer should know what corrosives are to be handled so he
can provide the proper impregnant. A concern here would be the
effects of high radiation on the organic resin as well as the
graphite,

The use of lined piping systems for corrosive surfaces is rap-
idly increasing. Linings include glass, plastics, elastomers, and
various metals. Lined pipe systems usually rely on carbon steel as
a main structural component: ease of fabrication and low cost permit
its use with most linings and manufacturing techniques, Glass-lined
steel pipe has one of the broadest ranges of corrosion resistance of
alle It's smooth surface improves product flow, but it has poor
impact and thermal shock resistance, requiring care and handling
during installation and maintenence, Thermal shock resistance could
be a valid concern where one plans fo completely and quickly remove

the fuel from the primary circult, several times per year.

205
3.4.1.5 Thermal and radiation~induced expansion. Temperature and
radiation will cause most materials to expand. This will affect the
choice of materials for core tubes, reactor vessel, and wt-of-reactor
equipment (pipes, pumps, heat exchangers) for primary, secondary,

and tertiary circuits. Table 3.4=1 gauges thermal expansion for some

materials of interest: both Mo and graphite lock attractive.

Core tubes need to be far enough apart that expansion does not
cause stresses by forcing them together. Design for longitudinal ex-
pansion will prevent bowing and/or breakage (of graphite).

Proper layout should accomodate expansion in out-of=-reactor piping.
Expaneion effects in a pump or heat exchanger are more critical: for-

tunately radiation levels there, from delayed neutrons, are near three

magnitudes below that in the core.

3.4.2 Chemical Reactions in an MCFR

Compatible ccntainment materials are those which do not form
stabie chlorides. Examples =re graphite, iron, nickel, and the re-
fractery metals. The chloridesof the pure fuel salt are hignly
stable, reacting little with materials they contact. However,
over the reactor life the core and blanket salts will mutate into
a variety of; compositions, begetting additional chemical species:
fissicn products and free chlorine from fission; other mutants
through neutron capture; oxygen creeping in through seals. For-
tunately, fluid systems can reprocess continuously (Section 3.7),
which helps to keep these impurities low.

Chemical reactions between these salt mixtures and inccm=
Datible. container materials could

1. Precipitate fissile material leading to criticality safety

problems

2. In the presence of high temperatures, high velocities, and

high radiation fields, cause corrosion leading to leakage

and maintenance problems.

207
3.4.2.1 Reactions with fission-produced mutants. When uranium fissians,
the ucl, molecular structure breaks up, creating three chlorine ions and
two fission products (FP). Table 3.4-IT [9] gives the valencies of. these
these-FP in their most stable state (largest free. energy of formation
[17,32,86,127] at reattor temperatures).

The FP will only form chlorides if the free enthalpy of formatim
exceeds about 20 kilojoules per mole chlorine: FP up to and including
molybdenum in Fig. 3.4=1. The gases xencn, kryptan, and probably iodine
and bromine are inert to chloridization; so are the more inert metals
such as palladium, technetium, ruthenium, rhodium, and probably tellur-
ium. Based cn MSRE experience , they will either entrain with the inert

gases or plate out on metal surfaces.

This suggests the production of about 80 kg insoluble metal per
Giwth~year, That amount of metal deposition warrants serious
attention to prevent restrictions and plugging.
Since each Pu atom fissions into two product atoms, the average
3 chloride ions ver Pu _

=15 % intai -
valency should be 5 FF per Pu 5 to maintain electro

neutrality. Chasonov showed that for PuCl, the average valency is
close to 2,0, indicating a deficiency of Cl ions. However, the re=-
moval of the relatively-inert metals like Ru, Pd, and Te, either
through plateout or deliberately by the reprocessing system, can
quickly lower the average valency, Below 1.5, Cl ions are in excess,
producing corrosion.

In summary, tube plugging may occur at some locations and tube

dissolution by corrosion at others, In-pile testing to high burnups

is needed to study these competing effects.

210
 

Ixperience on molten fluoride systems indicates that irradiation
and fission products do not accelerate corrosion (McLain p.800)
Molybdenum as a fission product with a yield of 18% (out of 200%)
of all fission products may remain, in part, in metallic form. When
molybdenum is the structural material, the corrosion problems of metal-
lic molybdenum or its alloys are strongly linked with the fission product
behavior in this medium. Fission fragment MoCl, will react with UCL,
to form uel, plus Mo. Likewise the excess chlorine released will react

with the strongest reducing agent present, UCl,, to form UCL L°

3.:.2.2 The effect of UCL, cresence in the core salt [311 Pure UCL,
highly corrodes container me-als, but both theory (stability of cor- |
rosion product chlorides) and labecratory experience show that dilute-UCl,
fuel salt attacks little: alloys of iron, nickel, or refractory metals
such as molybdenum resist chloride fuel and blanket salts, providing
the ucL; icy, mix contains no more than a few percent UCL . Alloys can
also include minor amounts of more reactive metals such as chromium if
the design allows for same surface leaching.

Extrapolating from CBNL experience with fluoride fuel salts at
comparable heat ratings, irradiation should neither release chlorine

from the melt nor enhance the attack of the container materials.

211
3.4.3 Candidate Materials for an MCFR

The high flux levels in an MCFR suggest high radiation damage,
However, due to the unique tube configuration the only exposed struc-
ture is the core/blanket interface: the blanket shields the vessel,
reducing its radiation dose by three magnitudes.

Beyond the high radiation envircnment of the reactor lie piping,
pumps, and heat exchangers for the primary fuel-coolant. These face
exposure to high temperatures, delayed neutron irradiation, and corro-
sicn by salt transmutant impurities.

Materials in the secondary and possible-tertiary circuits will
face a much milder envircnment. However, the amounts of materials
there greatly surpass those ir the primary circuit, thereby sensi-
tizing their cost: except for the high temperature helium case, one
prefers lower operating temperatures so as to allow cheaper materials.
The cost factor, however, must also be balanced with factors of corrosion,
thermal stress, and avoidance of secandary-coolant freezing (especially
for active liquid metal) on the intermediate heat exchanger tubes.

Table 3.4=-II] lists the most promising materials for use with the
different fluids. Strength cansideraticns dictate the temperature iimits.
Corrosion tests under MCFR conditions have generally not been carried
out yet. Materials which best resist corrosion by chemical attack
should be those with small free energy of chloride formation (Fig. 3.4=1).
Low vapor pressure (high boiling and melting points) will also allow
chlorides which form to remain as protective coverings. From avail-

able information (Figs. 3.4-1 and 3.4-2) Mo is a strong candidate..-

3.4.3.1 Overview on iletals, High nickel alloys and refractory metals
appear to be the only metals compatible with fuel and blanket salt,
Superior strength and resistance to corrosion and radiation embrittle
ment at high temperature recommend molybdenum alloys (particularly TZ)
for contact with the circulating fluid,

There is some incentive for using molybdenum alloys for all the
components (including pumps) which contact the salt. However massive
molybdenum outside the core would require precautions against its
external oxidation: e.gs enclosing the reactor vessel and other sensia
tive components in a hot box purged with an inert or slightly reducing
atmosphere, An alternztive to this would be to use duplex material:

steels,

For the less severe conditions of the reactor vessel and the salt
ducts returning from the heat exchanger, Hastelloy-N cr advanced devel-
opments of that alloy might suffice, However, having decided to use
molybdenum for the core/blanket membrane, a change to a dissimilar
metal elsewhere in the salt circuit could cause galvanic corrosion.
Mso, nickel alloys resist molten lead (a candidate secondary coolant)
very poorly compared with molybdenum; they would probably be subject
to attack when the lead leaked through the heat exchanger into the salt,
3e4e342 Ho 2lloys. Ho offers high temperature strength, good irra-
diation resistance, and high thermal conductivity: opromising traits
for a material in contact with fuel and blanket salts at hizh temper-
atures, However, fabrication of light molybdenum sections requires
welding and heat treatment: this technology needs development, but
it is already proceeding for other applications,

Also, the high specific cost of molybdenum is acceptable only on
a2 limited basis: the vessel piping, etic, should use materials which
are cheaper and more easily fabricated, Candidates include Mo/Fe,
Ho/Ni and Ti/Zr/Mo (TZ) alloys. With Mo/Fe indications are that the
swelling for Fe has already peaked at the operating temperatures,
while that for Mo occurs at much higher temperatures,

The use of molybdenum or its alloys may permit high fuel salt
temperatures (above 1000°¢). This can reduce fuel salt inventory
through higher power densities and allow gas turbine cycles and/or
process heat applications using helium as an intermediate and final

coolant,

215
Mo has an appreciable abscrption cross section for neutrons. Such
reactions also produce significant amounts of technetium. This changes
the nature of the structural material and makes it radioactive.

Figure 3.4~1 and the discussion in Section 3.4.2 indicated Mo to be

strengly corrosion resistant. The most significant reaction from the
standpoint of corrosicn should be (Fig. 3.3=13)
uel, + Mo ——3- 2 UCL, + MoCl,

UCi 4 will be a major constituent in the blanket from the neutron transmu-

tation of ThCL, . Free chioride from fission of U in the core will combine
with uCl, to form uel, . It also reacts directly with Mo:

Mo + cl, —e McCl,

Traces of oxygen or water will produce molybdenum oxide, e.g.

MoCl, + HC —3= MoO + 2 HCl

With all of these reactions, mechanical properties will change.

3.4.3.3 Graphite. Both carbon and graphite resist corrosion
and conduct heat well enough to warrant existing uses in heat
exchangers and pumps. A resin-bonded graphite has found wide
application in the chemical process industries. Both America
and France have used graphite with LiF /BeF, molten salt: Me=-
Donnell~Douglas markets a high-strength, woven graphite for this;
the French company PUK sells a product with graphite connected

to heat exchanger material [27].

The high thermal conductivity results in excellent thermal

216
 

shock resistance. Still one must exert care as carbon and graphite
are weak and brittle compared with metals.

Tensile strength varies between about 500 and 3000 1b/ in 2,
and impact resistance is nil. Abrasion resistance is poor. High=-
temperature stability is good and they can be used at temperatures
up to 4000 or 500C°F if protected from oxidation (burning).
Silicon-base coatings (silicides or silicon carbide) and iridium
coatings are claimed to give protection up to around 2900°F

Based on the existing experience as a structural material
for molten fluoride thermal breeders and on periodic replacement
of tubes, we assumed graphiie for the physics studies here: 2 cam

thick for the tube wall anc 4 cm thick for the vessel wall,

3.4.3.4 Heat exchanger considerations. As mentioned in sectimn 3.3.2.5
low vapor pressure of the primary and secondary fused salts permits
thin-walled heat exchangers. These are highly efficient in heat transfer,
thereby decreasing necessary area and fissile volume out-ofecore.

However, assuming close pitch, they will require development

and testing to resist the thermal and vibrational strains over

a long working life.

‘Refractory metals are attractive as they can accommodate high tem—-
peratures while still affording the good heat transfer of a metallic
material. A strong candidate is Mo. It does have an appreciable cross
section for neutron absorption: this affects delayed-neutron activation
but not neutron econcmy or radiaticn damage there. Of greater concern

is the welding and joining properties of Mo, its cost, and its oxidation.

1,4,4 Materials for the Core/Blanket Interface

Finding an interface material that can withstand a 10'® n em?

seo] flux over an acceptable period of time is indeed a challenge.
It is greatly eased by assuming periodic replacement of the few tubes:
an action far less complicated thar the conventional replacement of
fuel elements; just drain the core and blanket and uncouple the tubes
outside the reactor, This is especially feasible if one uses a cheap
material like graphite. Section 3.9, Access and Haintenance, discusses
this further. Still the tubes may experience a cumulative dose of 10%3

n cn in just a few months, Also irradiation of graphite produces

"3tored energy’.

dedeH Materials for Reactor Tessel

The reactor vessel will experience

(1) Low pressure

(2) Temperature higher than the blanket salt melting point

(3) Radiation damage from a 10'2 1 om? sec”! flux.
A suitable material must meet these conditions; it should also mini=
mize

(1) Induced radioactivity so as to maximize access

(2) Cost
Candidates include graphite and prestressed concrete (of low=

activating compositions).

3e4e6 Material for a Lead Secondary Circuit
3edebe1 Steam generator tubes, No 2lloys normally resist lead cor-
rosion well, but misht not if a steam generator lezked in small amounts
of oxysene Dissolving Mg or Ca as a getter in the lead would help
lower the oxygen level, but might not suffice, One could also clad
the molybdenum with an alloy which resists "oxygenated" lead; Fecraloy,
a ferritic steel containing aluminum, forms a protective alumina
film under these conditions,

A third, untried alternative, might be that PFecraloy alone can
resist both steam and oxygenated lead. Forming a duplex with stain-
less steel could overcome its poor high temperature strength,

The possibility of mailing the aeat exchanger tubes of Hastelloy-
NW has only slignt attractions: it would still need a Fecraloy or molyb-
denum external cladding to resist the lead,

and from the steam generators and also the steam generator shells
might be molybdenum, protected from external oxidation either by a
stainless steel cladding or by an inert atmosphere. An alternative

is Fecraloy, externally clad with stainless steel for strength.

219
 

3edeT Material for a Helium Secondary Circuit

The main change relative to the lead-cooled design is higher .tem-
peratures, parallel to a core temperature increase from 810 to 970°C.
This suggests the need for molybdenum alloys, especially on mechanical
grounds, However, even though there is no reason to doubt their cor-
rosion resistance at this temperature, any supporting evidence is com=
dletely lacking, British studies showed that design variations mignt
lower the salt puap operatinz temperature from 800°¢ to 670°C. This
would ease the engineering and the selection of materials,

Materials selection for nelium cooling should be much easier than
for lead cooling but so far has been little studied: unidentified probe
lems could become just as chzllenging as with lead-cooled systems.

Presumably a helium cooled system could draw on “the extensive
work already done with respect to HTRs and gas furbines: The MCFR
version could actually ride on the future HTR program.

HTR programs have recognised that, in practice, helium is not
an inert coolant since traces of air, moisture and other oxidizing
gases can cause corrosion and traces of carbonaceous ges can car-
burice structural materials, Thoush much work remains if does seen
likely that it will be possible to specify

example, to render the helium reducing.

Selected nickel alloys could be used for the turbines and other
circuit components, This would restrict the need for molybdenum in

3.5 Physics of MCFR(Th) and Its Fuel Cycle

3.5.1 Nuclear Models of an MCFR

3.5.1.1 Definition of the reactor geometry. Section 3.1.3 conclud-
ed that the best MCFR arrangement might be a small number of skewed
cylindrical tubes. The chain reaction will center where the tubes
converge. However, as no fuel salt boundaries exist along the tube
axes, criticality boundaries blur,

High levels of flux and power generation in the primary salt
may extend far along the tubes. This will depend on individual tube
subcriticality, distance of separation between tubes, and angle of
their skew. For example, if they are near critical by themselves and
are distant from one another, then their fluxes will follow a cosine
distribution over the total distance between bends. However, in=
creasing the intertube coupling will cause the fluxes within the tubes
to fall off more steeply beyond the tube convergence region.

Th concentration and other fuel salt parameters will also affect
neutron distributions because they moderate the neutrons which shorte
ens their mean free path. Fluxes will also extend into the blanket
in all directions but with much shorter relaxation lengths.

The choice of tube arrangement will depend upon a detailed trade
study of effective core size: extension of the chain reaction out
along the tubes will increase exposure of the pressure vessel to
neutrons emanating from the tubes; making the core size small re-

duces stability of the system to perturbations.

221
3.5.1.2 Use of spherical geometry for neutronic calculations.
Neutronics analyses of complicated geometries require expensive Monte
Carle calculations, For.the present survey purposes, it should .

|
suffice to use simple one-dimensional spherical geometry featuring
five zones (Fig. 3.51): core, core tube wall, blanket, vessel wall,

and reflector.

ore reactor
tube vessel
wall wall

core | blanket reflector
1

Fige 3.51 Cne-dimensicnal Spherical Model

All the tube wall material gets lumped into one spherical shell.
The validity of this approach, vs. uniform material distribution in
the spherical core, will depend upon the number of actual tubes. For
only three or four tubes, the current thinking, it should do quite well.

Taking the tube wall thickness to be two cm facilitates compar-
isons with MCFR(Pu) studies. The vessel wall is four cm thick; the
reflector zone, 40 cm. A check calculation with 20 cm reflector:
thickness showed no significant changes when the blanket thickness
was 200 cm (quasi-infinite).

Section 3.5.7.2 studies the effect of blanket thickness, settling
on a value of 200 cm for most cases. The critical core radius usually

ranges 25.= 50 cme.

222
Section 3.3.5.6 gives the densities of individual salts and an
algorithm for combining them. Densities for graphite and nickel were
0.1 and 0.09 atoms cm * barn.

A primary difference between an exact calculation and those in
spherical geometry is likely to be the spectrum softening and other
effects of the ThCl ,/Nacl blanket salt intermediate between the fuel
salt tubes. Depending on the clearance and skew angle between tubes,
a smeared model of such a spherical region would probably include 5=
25% blanket salt by volume.

In this regard, the calculations may be better done in infinite-
cylinder geometry. That remains to be shown however, and cylindrical
calculations cost more. In the meantime, spherical critical U masces
(U) or ¥slunes can be corrected to cylindrical geometry by use of -

shape factors:
Ue (L/D) = Uson / SF(L/D)
Fig. 3.5~2 displays some experimental and calculated data. A sub=
set of these (Table 3.51) was fit with a least squares program to
produce the following algorithm for use in Section 3.5.5 studies:
log SF(L/D) = 6.399 x 1072 log(L/D) = 0.6976 (Log(L/D))*

3e5 2 Neutronic Calculational Methods

Neutronic analysis of small fast reactors like MCFRs generally
requires transport theory. Modeling the reactor as a one-dimensional
symmetric sphere permits use of the well established and efficient
ANISN code [129].

3454241 Spatial mesh. A spatizl mesh of 1/10 of 2 mean free path
ocr interval would give quasi-exact results in transport theory
calculations. Computer storage and cost generally prohibit this,
A mesh of one mean path (mfp) per interval suffices for most cal-
culations,

In MCFR(Th) calculations, the neuiron mean free vath tyvically
ranges from 1-10 cm (Table 3,5-II), With a core radius of 30-80 cm,
a 200 cm blanket and a 40 cm reflector, a uniform one mfp interval
mesh would mean a lot of intervals, Furthermore, most would lie
outside the core, leading to possible numerical instability in the
iterative transport theory calculations, Consquently a coarser mesh
was used (Table 3,5-II), especially outside the core. This worked
fine for most of the survey calculations; a few select effects needed
finer detail,

3,502.2 Angular quadrature, Most studies were done with an 5 angu=-
lar quadrature, Sg check calculations on the smallest of spheres
showed increased neutron leakage as expected, but only increased the
volume by 1,5%, while decreasing BG by ~ 0.01.

Je5e243 Convergence criteria, Initial survey calculations satisfied
a k convergence of 0,01 and a critical radius search convergence

eff

of 19%, Select effects required 0.001 k cp = convergence.

3.5.3 Neutron Cross Sectians

This study required neutron cross sectians for Th, 233, 23hy,
23%, 233y fission products, C, Na, Ni, and Cl. Data for 236, Mo,

F, and other carrier salt cations were desirzhle,

3.5.3.1 Bondarenko 26 group set [93], - The Bondarenko neutron crbss
section library long ago established itself for fast réacior calcu-
lations. Testing has revealed deficiencies in the Pu isotopes, 235y,

238 i
U, but these nuclei by and large do not appear in an MCFR(Th).

and
Less is known in general about Th and 233g cross sections; they are. cur-
rently undergoing extensive reevaluation for ENDF/B-5, For survey
purposes here, the 3ondarenk: values in Pl-cor-ecied PO form (trans—
port cross sections) should suffice,

Nuclei missing from the library are Cl and F. Early in the
study, K substituted for Cl: this was conservative as K absorbs
more neutrons. Final calculations used CL and FPl sets derived {ram

ENDF/B - IV.

3.5.3.2 Twenty-six group, P1 set from ENDF/B~IV. Available
late in this study was a 92-group Pl set of cross sectians gener-
ated by AMPX [130] from ENDF/3-IV, containing most of the materials
of interest here. This was too large and expensive to run so the
set was collapsed to 26 groups similar (Table 3.5-III) to those in
the Bondarenko library to allow cross—-comparison and -usage.
The list of materials included not only Cl but also F. Missing
however were Na and C. Comparison of their nuclear properties indicat-
ed Mg would represent Na well, especially since Na content is small

compared to Cl. For C, the Bondarenko set was used; C ic also a minor

3.5.3.3 Effects of resonance self-shielding. Resaance-regicn
cross sectians for the two sets described above were averaged
assuming the materials to be infinitely dilute, i.e. ignoring
resonance self-shielding. In 233y most of the reactivity effects
from fission and capture self-shielding, if present, would cancel

each other. Self-shielding for 23 Th capture, if present, could
affect BG.

The Bondarenko-calculated self-shielding factors for capture
(Table 3.5-I7 ) show virtually no self-shielding in the top 12
groups, which cover well th:z core and blanket spectra. “hat little

buildup in the fuel merits special attention because it heads a

3.5.5 Pertinent Physics Metrics

3.5.5.1 BG: actual breeding gain. The conventional definition

of BG is

rate of fissile production 3
BG rate of fissile destruction (3.5.5-1)

The question then arises: which materials are fissile and which
fertile? Convention says 23 is fertile, but in the very hard

HCFR neutron spectrum it behaves like a fissile: CO, exceeds Oy over
most of the neutrcn spectrum (Fig. 2.1-5), suggesting a bare

critical mass smaller than that for 2p (69 kg), LO (159 kg),

or hla (114 kg) [1351. 232.11 and 22% cannot sustain a chain
rzaction, Thus we lapel 233, 234, and 2355 as fissiles im an iI0F3,

232m, and 238; 2s non-Tissilcs.

BG can mean the instantaneous BG at any given point in time (of
the burnup cycle) or a time-averaged BG such as over a given LMFBR re-
fuelling cycle or reactor life. As the survey nature of this study
precludes a detailed fuel management analysis, this study deals

only with instantaneous BG, presumably on equilibrium cycle:

BG = Th capture rate

rate of 23 3, 23 hy, 23 X fission

This certainly differs in >>°U treatment from that for a thermal Th/22yU-

MSBR: however each reflects the physical realties of the corresponding

neutron spectra, and this definition does agree with equation (3.5¢5.=1)

above.

251
 

3.5.5.2 BGX: BG extended to zero neutron leakage. BGX
gauges the BG potential of a reactor design in the event that
neutrons which presently escape from the reactor (outer) blanket

(CB) were instead captured there in the same proportims as

present.

BX = (120) | 2 [rn capture wre | ‘ ( -
/ | total abs rate! kz 3
- J

~

0B

This metric thus indicates what additional BG can be obtained

through a larger blanket.

3.5.5.3 BGP: BG potential associated with the core spectrum.

The theoretical limit to BG forms another valuable metric of an MCFR(Th).

Taube calculated previously-unheard=cf BG = 0.7~0.8 (BR = 1.7-1.8)
for an MCFR(Pu).

Section 3.1.1.1 defined BG potential as the numer, of neutrons

available for breeding per 233g fission,

t 232, .and 233

That ignored all actinides
excep U. The net result depended primarily on 30;

for 233y and indicated a potential for BGs up to 0.4 on the 232, 233

fuel cycle.

The ideal situation would be for 232mm to capture neutrons which
leave the core: i.e. for none to leak out the blanket nor be lost to
parasitic capture, Then BG = Vy -2. However, for the MCFR here-we
must return from utopia and allow at least for parasitic losses due

to necessary core salt components, This then gives

3.5.5.4 Gb core” The core-averaged total flux will primarily
indicate the rate of damage to, and thereby replacement of, the

suming a constant lethargy flux within a group's boundaries.
This metric proves to be a valuable barometer of BGP (Fig. 3.50)

3.5.5.8 Fuel inventory and doubling time. Doubling time (DT) provides
a pertinent measure of the economics and physics of a breeder reactor:
the time required to breed enough extra fuel to start up another re-
actor. That should really encompass the whole fuel cycle: core +
blanket + primary loop + ineplant stockpiles + transport + fuel fab-
rication + fuel reprocessing + outw-of-plant storage.

However, perhaps because solid fuel reactors all require similar
ex-reactor fuel cycies, DT canventionally measures just the time for
duplicating core and blanket. To facilitate comparison, this study
adopts that definition also except that the MCFR must also include
its full primary circuit contents:

U. + U + U
oT i o b

= (3.5.52)
BG production rate

 

Here
U; = U content inside the reactor vessel; more precisely be-
tween the ex~vessel bends of the tubes (Fig. 3.2-9,-10,
and-11)
U_ =

o = U inventory in primary circuit beyond (outside) the
reactor vessel: piping, pumps, and heat exchangers.
Section 3.4 indicates the volume Vy = 2=3 .
Uy = Blanket U content
This should result in a conservative comparison of the MCFR
fuel cycle to the solid fuel cycle of other breeder reactors: solid
fuel will require much more inventory in storage, transportation,
decladding, and fabrication operations; the MCFR, little. Both

cycles should involve similar amounts of chemical processing, but

255
 

the MCFR going from liquid to liquid state, may require fewer steps

and therefore less U.

The odd geometry of the skewed tube configuration increases the
in~-vessel U content, Uso considerably beyond the calculated critical
spherical mass, U_. If there was only one cylindrical tube (N=1)

then the volume ve associated with Us would be

V,(N=1) = TDL/4 = V_/SF(L/D) (3.5.5-3)

where
vo = critical volume in spherical geometry
SF = L/D=dependent shape factor (Sec. 3.5.1.2)
L = critical cylinder length. With a single cylinder, L = H
H = distance along tube between bends. Considering the 2

D = critical cylinder diameter

Rearranging Eq. 3.5.53, get
1
L/D = (WL? SFL) / 4 V2 (345.51)
Since SF depends on L/D, Eq. 3.5.5=4 is transcendental: it must
be solved iteratively or by graphical intersection technique.

If N> 1 and the tubes lay sufficiently apart from one another
(lcosely coupled), then vy (N>1)=N vs (N=1). However, this is
not of interest because we prefer strong intertube neutronic coupling
(Section 3.1.3.2).

With strong coupling, if N tubes were not skewed but lay ad-

256
jacent to one another, then their combined cross sectional area
would approach that of a single large tube, then

vi (N >1) = vi (N=1) of Eqe 3 e5e5=30
In cantrast, when skewed the maximum y the tubes closely approach

one ancther only near their midpoints. Then no tube sustains the
neutron chain reaction very well outside the close-approach zone.
The critical geometry of that zone should resemble a square cylinder
(L/D=1), somewhat squeezed at its middle into the shape of an hour
glass or a wheat stack (LL).

The large mean free paths of fast neutrons tend to negate the
"tubular" protusions of core salt from this geometry: next collisions

will probably occur in the neutron-absorbing blanket. Then with

The differences in V;- correspond to the differences between zero and
maximum skew angle respectively, Thus the true results would lie
intermediate, For the present study we take v. at some value of low
significant figure slightly below the Eq. 3.5~7 line (for N=3).:@ This
should result in a conservative estimate of DT. To get uy or U we

multiply 7, or V_ by UV.

ively, passing into the shim tank. b is actually a net removal rate:

3.5.6,2 Equilibrium fuel cycle. We now study a specific situation of
interest —- the equilibrium cycle where compositions have stabilized and
ja Jat { each = O. The starter fuel does not affect the equilibrium

composition; only the feed material and neutron spectrum control it.
This section seeks to determine the relations which express

1. The equilibrium proportions of actinides in primary circuit

and blanket

2. The equilibrium breeding gain and/or reactor doubling time.

ANISN calculations provide the reaction probability rates (per
atom) § $) « In addition we specify the core uranium concentration,
and blanket thickness. Together with a critical core radius search,
this fixes Ug 1h, and Thy. Nine unknowns remain: Uggs Use Uggs
Usps Usps Usps f, b, and c. There are seven equations, 3.5.6=1 =

doubling time.

3.5.6.3 On the choice of U removal rates c and b. This section
studies how ¢ and b affect the core = 3u/23 4 ratio and blanket

U content (0) using reaction rates calculated for an MCFR model
with 30/35/35 NaCl/ThCl, UCL, molar composition and 7/1 “u/*My
ratio in the core salt. Section 3.5.8 shows the importance of high

233y /23hy ratio in the core salt. Uy should be minimized because

264
 

it degrades BG export (U,) and increases doubling time (DT); it
also generates unwanted power and radioactivity in the blanket.

Figure 3.59 shows how increasing b quickly reduces Uy to nil.
The total U inventory (U,) then comprises just the primary circuit
contents, U; + Ug. Meanwhile, U, rises from oblivion to its max-
imum level. Since Uy and Ug vary with b in opposite directions,
their quectient DT (Eq. 3.5.6=17) varies even more strongly with b
(Fig. 3.510). Core 233y 234 ratio also varies markedly with b in
Fig. 3.510.

All these comparisons argue for b= 1077, but not much beyond
thate Fig. 3.511 shows thet high c keeps 233y 23h high and only
slightly affects DT adverse_y. It seems to warrant C as high as
107s, but not crucially so. Note that c¢ = 1077 implies a primary
u removal rate of p=¢/§ =c¢ Vg/ Tye Thus the requirement on p will
typically fall a factor of 10 or more below (be far less stringent
than) that on c.

A rate of 10~%/s implies the removal of 1 ppm of the U per second,
or a complete processing of that zcne every 11.6 days. Though that
may be doable, a rate of 1077/s or full processing in 116 days seems
more reasonable while imposing no severe penalty.

Detailled analysis in other studies shows the same b and c be-

havior patterns there. Thus we adopt bac=10"'/ s as a reference for

this work, We also conclude that physical reprocessing limitations
should not prevent us from achieving near-optimum 23 3/23 Ay ratio

and DT and small Uy

3.5,7.1 Inner blanket study. Taube studied [17] inner blankets up

+o 1.1 m in radius for spherical MCFR(Pu) and (fluoride) MFFR(Pu). In
each case the outer blanket remained cne—meter thick. With pure fissile
(no fertile) salt in the core, the 3G slightly increased for an NCFR(PU)

and decreased for an IFFR(Pu)s Fig. 3.5-12 shows the changes by zone in
the MFFR(Pu study: inner blanket breeding increases with its volume,

but also softens the core neutron spectrum. The result is increased

fixed reactor diameter, which controls the overall plant size, an inner
blanket does not appear worthwhile relative to just increasing the out-
er blanket thickness. Furthermore even if marginal BG advantages were
found, the added engineering complexity would probably discourage it.

To verify the affect of an inner blanket a study was made in spher—
ical gecmetry. Figures 3.5-13 and 3.5-14 show the results fora
censtant total blanket thickness of 200 cm. As the IB diameter increas-
es, the annular core moves radially outward. As a result

1. The core volume increases, decreasing the power density

2. The core spectrum softens

3. Neutron leakage from the reactor increases

Le Inner breeding increases and outer breeding decreases resulting

in a strong net decrease
The accelerating BG decrease is primarily caused by the increasing neu-

tron leakage and secondly by the softened core spectrum effect on BG

potential,

3.5.7.2 Cptimum outer blanket thickness. A study was made to determine
what constituted an infinite (cuter) blanket thickness to BG. It assumed

no inner blanket. The study considered ThCl, /UCL, molar ratios in

the core of 0,1, and 3, The NaCl molar content in the fuel salt

was 30%. The results (Fig. 3.5-15) indicate that 2 m is near in-
finite.

Figure 3.5-16 shows that the outer blanket also shields the
vessel from the high core flux: a two-meter thickness reduces

the damage (> 0.1 MeV) flux by over 3 magnitudes down to the level

of the delayed neutrons.

to 0.3442 or 0.2%. The critical radius increased from 26,11

to 26.14 cm or 0.1% (a critical volume increase of 0.3%). Thus
cutting the reflector thickness in half barely shows up above the
accuracy of the calculations. this result ccrresponds well to that
of the previous secticn: namely that two meters censtitutes a

near-infinite dlaaketi thickness.

Comparisan of C and li reflecters for a 3/1 Th/U core ratio and 5m
thick blanket showed no detectable differences. For a 0/1 Th/U core ratic
and 1-m thiek blanket, C performed much better (BG=0.106) than Ni (BG=
0.040); the critical core rzdius differed little. The BG difference
probably stems from the moderating power of C: neutrons reflected by C
stand a ruch better chance cof capture by Th than those reflected by Ni.
This recommends C for cases where a non=infinite blanket is used. For
> 1.5-2.0 m thick blankets and 65/35 hel, NaCl mixture, a neutron re-

flector appears unneeded.

3.5.7.4 Core tube material, In an MCFR (Pu) study [75], 2 20

Mo/80 Fe alloy for ihe core/blanket wall reduced 3G by 0.04 relative
“to a C wall, As the 20} Ho dominated the neutron absorptions there

(61%), 100% Ho tubes might Teduce BG by C.2. The MCFR(Pu) study

assumed in-core cooling with the tubes occupying 5¢%5 of the core

volume, In the present HCFR(Th) concept the 2-cm tubes occupy several

times thai proportion of volume but they lie more on the periphery,

Thus a 3G effect similar to 0.2 might be expected.

3.5.8 Reactor Design: Controlling the Core 233 234 Ratio

3.5.8.1 Basis for studying the ratio. 23 content affects the
Section 2-adduced goals: hard neutron spectrum, high BG, and mine
irmm presence of Pu and other heavy actinides. Although 23 bey
content is not a design (independent) variable but rather a physics
consequence (dependent variable), still design variables like NaCl/
UCLy/ThCl, molar composition can influence it. Therefore we study
its effects as if it were an independent variable, looking at 233 u/
23by = 3,5, and 7.

The MCFR model used as a basis in the study included a core salt

molar composition of 30/70/C NaCl/UCl;/ThCl and a 200 cm blanket.

3.5.8.2 Effect of the ratio on spectrum, BG, and Pu presence.
Fig. 3.517 shows that 23k softens the neutron spectrum ( Ey core

decreases. This is probably due to a higher (Cine? /<C fiss >
ratio for 23M campared to that for 233, Bly also reduces BG and
power density. Table 3.5=IX shows that the major BG reduction stems
directly from the lower {V6 —q) value for 234, not from spectral
softening. This same phenomenon decreases the reactivity of high

23 hy systems: that accounts for the larger critical volumes and lower
power densities.

Intuitively, a high ratio will minimize the presence of Pu and
other heavy actinides (the third goal): 23h heads the chain that
leads to them.

In summary, a high 233y 234 ratio promotes all three goals of

hard neutron spectrum, high BG, and minimal Pu presence.

3.5.8.3 Effect on reactor fissile inventory and doubling time.
Because 23 by is a fissile MCFR fuel, the reactor U inventory varies
little in this study. However, the U export rate (Eq. 3.5.6~16) does
increase with decreasing 23 by content, reaching 0.25 MT/yr for the
ratio 233/23 by = 7. Figure 3.518 shows the consequent effect on
doubling time. This recommends a high 233y 23 hy ratio; however,

significant effort to reach higher ratios may not be warranted.

reaction rates and choosing b and c, the equations of Sece 345.842
specify the 233y/234y ratio, However, this ratio for the fuel cycle
will depend on the reaction rates used. These, in turn, depend on
the ratio assumed apriori in the neutronic analysis of the equil-
ibrium fuel cycle. Figure 3,5-19 suggests that the two converge
near 233/234 = 9% for b=c=10"' and near 124-13 for boc=107C, This
is for a 30/70/0 NaC1/UC1,/ThCl, molar composition. Similar behavior
is presumed for other MCFR models.

The results of later calculations with the refined set of P1 Cl

233/234 = 8% and 11% for b = ¢ = 10™1 and 1078, respectively.

3.5.9 Reactor Design: Choosing the Core Salt ThCl /UCL, Ratio
0 -

To approach its BG potential (BGX or BGP) the reactor must
capture its excess neutrons in fertile material. One means of re-
ducing neutron leakage from the reactor is to thicken the outer
blanket (Sec. 3.5.6.2) so that the fertile fuel captures or reflects
most of the neutrons which escape the core. Another way is to add
fertile material to the core fuel thereby reducing the core neutron
leakage. However, this also softens the neutron spectrum, which
lowers the BG potential (BGP).

With an MCFR(U/Pu) Taube reported [17] BG up to 0,7~0.8 with such
techniques. The following subsections study the optimum fertile

content in an MCFR(Th) core. They assume a salt mixture of 30%

280
 

WaCl and 70% (UCL, + ThCl,) and a “u/%%y ratio of 7/1.

3e5.9.1 Effect on BG. Fig. 3.5-20 shows the results of ANISN
calculations. Neutrons leak significantly from a one-meter blanket
so the choice of reflector affects BG. Then one prefers ThCl, /UCL, =
C.

When the blanket thickness exceeds 2.0 m however, few neutrons
leak and the reflector has little effect. [Th] = O then produces
the greatest BG because it engenders the hardest neutron spectrum
(Fig. 3.521) and consequently, the most excess neutrons (Sec. 3.5.5.5).

Fig. 3.520 also shows the BG from the 1956 ORNL study [13] of an
MCFR(Pu) which included a Pb core-reflector and a graphite-moderated
thin blanket. The larger ¥ value for Pu causes the high BG. Few
neutrons leak despite low fertile content, but this is because of
high (83%) carrier salt content. BG could actually be higher were
it not for the spectrum softening and neutron absorption by the
carrier salt.
3.5.9.2 uffect on reactor fissile inventory and doubling time.
Substituting ThCl, for uc, decreases density, However, the critical
core radius increases near proportionally, and volume increases even
faster. Thus, overall, Th dilution increases the spherical critical
mass Ug (Fig. 3.5=22) and the corresponding mass in the tubes Us
(from Fig. 3.57)« In contrast, the primary circuit volume outside

In the 1956 ORNL study [13] of an MCFR(Pu) the minimum plant inven
tory occurred at a 238 py ratio of 2 (Figs 3¢5-23), similar to this work.
The MCFR(Pu) total fissile inventory however lies roughly a factor
of 3 below that for the present MCFR(Th) study: the reason is great
dilution of the Pu fuel mixture by carrier salt(83% meclar content).

In Fig. 3.524 the BG export rate 0 for bec=10"1/ s (defined

3.5.7.3 Effect on power density and flux levels

The power density limit of 10 M{/liter (Section 3.2.2.2) reflects more
a premonition cf problems than a recognition of any specific. ones.
+311, flux levels in the core tubes and the pressure vessel closzly
relate to power density (section 3.2.2.3). Figure 3.525 shows

how ThCl, dilution of the care salt markedly reduces power density
and fluxes alike.

The skewed-tube geometry will further increase the critical mass
(lower the power density). A cylinder with length-to-diameter ratio
(1/D) near 1.0 requires about 10% more critical mass in low density
metal systems than does a sphere; with L/D~2, about 40% more, The
heterogeneity of multiple skewed tubes further increases critical
mass as does neutron capture and scatter by the blanket ThCl I, in
between the tubes. Altogether these effects should reduce power
density and fluxes by more than a factor of two compared to spheres.
Amlied to Fig. 3.5.25, the result is that Thel, /UCl, = 0.1 now

satisfies the power density criteria of < 10 H/ 1.

At higher The, /UCL, ratios the > 100 keV flux in the vessel

“lor ¢10% n a2 in 30 years. That

falls below 10° n en” s
level will allow operation over the reactor life for many metals.

Meanwhile the core flux level will be ~ 1073 n em mol.

Presumably, most materials won't be able to take many months of that.
This emphasizes the importance of our design: straight tubes, easily

replaced, and not touching one another.

3.5.10 Reactor Design: Core Carrier Salt (NaCl) Content

Like ThCl L? NaCl substitution for uc, in the primary salt
significantly reduces the fissile inventory outside the core tubes,
but also degrades the neutronic performance in the core. This
section analyzes scme of these physics consequences assuming a core

233, 231

salt composed of zero ThCl, and a ratio of 7. Results

are compared with those from ThCl 5 substitution (Secs 3.5.9).

3.5.10.1 ©ffect on BG. NaCl decreases BG through parasitic ab-
sorption and moderation of neutrons. Fig. 3.528 combines the results
from the present MCFR(Th) study with the behavior derived from an

HMCFR(Fu) study by Taube. The results suggest

1. Generally minimizing the NaCl content

2. Absolutely avoiding NaCl molar content 80%

Fig. 3.529 compares NaCl substitution relative to ThCl,
substitution on an expanded scale. One sees that ThCl, diminishes
BG slightly less than NaCl does. The probable reason is that most
neutron capture in ThCl 4 contributes to BG (even considering the
four Cl atoms), whereas none of that in NaCl does. Table 3.5IX
supports this.

With a thinner blanket, the ThCl y

3.5.9.2, NaCl substitution for UCl, increases the fissile inventory
in the core tubes within the vessel. However, the larger inventory
outside the vessel decreases faster. Thus the total inventory
(primary circuit plus blanket) decreases with increasing NaCl
content.

NaCl substitution also decreases the BG export rate, but only
elightly. Unlike ThCl, substitution, NaCl substitution continues
to decrease DT down through 30% ucl, molar content. However, beyond
that point Secs 3.5.10.1 indicates that BG should fall off drastic-

ally, with consequent DT increase.

3.5.10.3 ©ffect on power density and flux levels. Figure 3.5331
shows how NaCl substitution for uti, decreases the power density and
flux levels. However, ThCl —substitution causes an even faster de=
crease. In both cases the blanket composition remains constant.
Thus the greater fall-off in flux from adding ThCl, to the core salt
must stem from the higher microscopic absorption cross section for Th
than for Na (Table 3.5~X), resulting in less neutron leakage from the
core.

The difference that ThCl, makes relative to NaCl might allow

the use of a thinner blanket,

changes increase the 23 Ly content. 233y capture increase also de-

creases the 233y content, giving a double effect. All three effects
work in concert to decrease the ratic (Fig. 3.532).

Differences between NaCl and ThCl, as salt substitutes appear
to be small. NaCl mostly scatters elastically while ThCl 4 scatters
more inelastically. The different shapes of the NaCl and Thi, curves
in Fig..3.532 may reflect these differences: Th inelastic scatter

should contribute more to spectrum softening at low non-fissile con-

tent where the neutrons still exceed the inelastic threshold energy.

3.5.11 Mutation Effects

J.5.11.1 Significance of actinides which emit alphas. Reactor

irradiation transmutes actinides into long-lived alpha-emitters:

they increase in atomic number (2) and weight (A) through (n,¥)

reactions and A ~decay; they then generally decrease slowly in 2

and A through alpha decay, finally becoming a stable nucleus.

Alpha emitters are undesirable because

Combination or these factors defines the toxicity of an isotope = just
how much of a practical threat it pores. Table 3,5-XI includes a tox~
icity classification along with other pertinent physics information.
The moderate half-lives of Pu plus their early preeminence in the act-
inide burnup chains warrant their highly toxic classification, Carcin-
osenicity further emphasizes avoiding their.production.

The problem with (oyn) reactions as well as spontaneous fission
neutrons is that neutrons penetrate gamma shielding: in addition +o
harming workers directly, they can activate the surroundings, presenting
longer-term hazards.

Mumerous light elements (up through Al and Si) undergo these re-
actions with alphas. Figs 35-33 shows some relative yields, F,
though not included there reacts almost as strongly as Be, F, Li,
and Be are candidate materials for (blanket) salt mix; this phenom-
enon argues against their use unless the neutron signal and hazerd
are desired for non-proliferation purcoses, Section 3.7 mentions the
use of y 0, ligy and Ta with various reprocessing schemes; this
phenomenon would discourage their use there somewhat,

action (Fig. 345-33) makes isotopes emitting higher—energy alphas part

To remove most of this aad other radiation one could chemically
separate the uranium in the core salt from the 208 and all other
actinides and fission products, However, this would not separate 233y

1 Rem/hour. Furthermore, if only 99% removal efficiency was achieved,
a + Rem/hour surface dose from 208 alone would be present in the
interim,

From this one concludes that a highly efficient scientific group
with laboratory facilities (such 2s a national laboratory) might be
able to make a bomb without getting a deadly radiation dose, but all
others would encounter difficulty.

In addition to these complications, the tell-tale 2084) signals
would continue to emanate from the separated waste as well as from the
new regenerating source in the separated U., All these troubles must

discourage subnaticnal groups which contemplate taking and using 233

The effect of such activity on 2 conventional solid fuel cycle,
would probably be +o require costly shielding and remote handling to
protect the workers. This means in fuel fabrication plants and, pos=—
~ioly, at the end stages of processing planis. A molten salt fuel
cycle autoustes the reprocessing far more; the shorter time out-of-
core should also reduce the activity due to neutron absorption re-
actions with each member of the decay chain.

teanwhile, in any breeding zzin set aside, the radiation hazard
will start adding to thet from fission products aad actinides and in-
crezse For several years, Thus the oiggest problem which 232 pre-—

zents in 2 molien salt taoriun cycle should ove transport of oreeding

gain: radiction will make tha fuel unwieldy (heavy shielding and re-—
mote handling) and hazardous, thereby somewhat unattractive to diver-
sion and ito wvezvpons manufacture by subnatioral groups.

Since 232 and 2335 are chemically inseparavle this radiation
hazard will continue to manifest itself for many multiples of the
232 72-year halflife, i.es for centuries. 3y leaving the breeding
gain in chloride form it is ready to startup another plant, without

intermediate handling.

3.5.12 Summary

Section 3.5 attempted a first cut at optimizing the reactor des~
ign and composition and also analyzed some of the consequences there-
from. The first six subsections defined methods, data, and models.

Sec. 3.5.7 discouraged the use of an inner blanket and showed
that two meters constitutes an infinite outer blanket, In that event
a reactor reflector contributes little, In addition to achieving
maximum BG, the 2 m-blanket greatly reduces the flux dose to the
reactor vessel. Sec. 3.5.7 also favored graphite as the core tube
wall material because Mo strongly absorbs neutrons.

Section 3.5.8 showed tnat design decisions which favor a high
233 23M ratio in the core salt produce

1. A hard neutron spectrum there

2. Higher BG and lower DT

3. Minimal presence of Pu and other high—A actinides
Fortunately, within the ranges of interest, all the trade studies
indicate that the 233y j23ky ratio on equilibrium fuel cycle will
exceed 7. That is sufficiently high to achieve the above goals;
additional major efforts are unwarranted.

Sections 345.9 and 3.5.10 revealed that both ThCl, and NaCl,
acting as diluents in the core salt, greatly reduce flux levels and
the amount of out~of-core fissile inventory. They also reduce BG.
The combined effects of inventory and BG produce an optimum DT near
a U molar composition of cbout 30% and a Th/U ratio of 1-2. This

and the lower flux levels explain the preference of other MCFR

308
 

studies for a fissile molar content of 15-30 %. However, low fissile
content will decrease the 233y /23hy ratio, an indication of greater

transplutonium buildup. Thus the true optimum remains to be found

and will depend on final assignment of priorities.

DT of 20-30 years appear feasible. This is high compared to
quoted DT 13-20 years for an MSBR on the Th fuel cycle. However,
an MCFR(Th) should build up less transplutonium.

Efforts to lower DT should focus on the out-of-core inventory.
Note also, that, compared to conventional reactors, the absence of
fuel fabrication and decladding operations and the minimal trans—
portation and storage needs provide additional fuel inventory ad-—
vantages which are not taken into account here.

Section 3.5.11.1 quantified somewhat the basis for avoiding
transplutonium buildup. Sec. 3.5.11.2 pinpointed fresh blanket U
as the greatest proliferation hazard. By immediately mixing it with
core salt, one adds not only fission product activity, which is
chemically removable, but also 232 daughter radicactivity which
is not. The radioactivity will discourage U handling, but not make
it impossible. Sec. 3.5.11.3 showed that the presence of too much

FP can seriously redace BG.

Section 343.5.6 indicatzs a typical temperature coefficient
of salt density of 0.000k p/p /°C. ANISN calculations (Section
3.5.8.3) reveal that 0.050 #4 lowers reactivity by 0.034 Ak/ Xk,
a coefficient of 0.68 sky k / “Ip . Applying the above gives

-27 x 1072 Ak °c, Using Bars = 0.00068 one gets a strong
negative temperature coefficient of ~4O0¢ /°C.

3.6.2 Analysis of Normal Cperations

3.6.2.1 Reactor startup. MCFR coolant circuits and salt supply will

need preheating just like an SBR does, A sali of subcritical fuel

concentration or even a low-melting non-fuel salt could fiow test
the circuit. Cne might approach zero power criticality and sub~-

sequent rise to power by gradually adding fissile fuel through the

clean-up loop to a subcritical fuel salt.

3.6.2.2 Reactor ccntrol., A limited study [29] indicated feasible
control of reactor and power level by manipulating the secondary
circuit conditions: mainly varying the flow rate of salt through -

the ccre and heat exchangers. The negative temperature ccefficient
will hold the salt temperature nearly constant at all power levels.

The absence of the heat transfer and fuel pin temperature differentials

of a solid—fuel reactor allow this direct response.

3.6.2.3 Reactor stability and inventory ratio. The amount of fuel
in the primary circuit outside the core fixes the effective delayed
neutren fraction and affects the reactor stability. The British

[29] showed that an MCFR(U/Pu) should be stable to small reactivity

3.6.3 Analysis of Accident Situations

Continual removal of volatile fission products frem the salts
during cperaticon eliminates several obnoxious species from being
present in an accident. Many of the remaining hazards would stay
in the salt. Thus, no accident can occur which corresponds in se-
verity of radioactivity to the meltdovm of solid fuel systems. The
major concern then becomes that no primary circuit failure lead to

critical masses forming.

3.6.3.1 Small leakages. Leaks between core snd blanket pose ne
sericus chemical threat as the salts are compatible. However, other
factors influence whether tiz pressure difference should force

core salt leaks into the blanket or vice versa,

Higher temperatures in the core salt may produce higher vapor
pressures there than in the blanket. The core salt also circulates
under pump pressure while the blanket salt need not. If a reserve
tank autcmatically replaced fuel salt leaking into the blanket, the
system could simultaneously approach supercriticality and high
temperature, a strong temperature coefficient not withstanding. The
high temperature could further abet the deterioration. In contrast,
blanket salt leaking into the core would only dampen the criticality:
however, this could result in degraded system performance.

An anomalous rise in concentration of 233y or fission product
in the blanket, or a rise in temperature there (due to increased
fissions), ar a drop in core salt pressure would signal core-to-

blanket leakage. Leakage of blanket salt into the core would decrease

the core mean temperature and blanket salt pressure.

318
The secondary coolant circuit should be pressurized slightly
higher above the primary one, and the tertiary even higher. This
will cause less active coolants like helium or lead to leak into
the molten salt. He is inert and the salt cleanup system, which
already separates the fission product gases, would remove helium
as well. Lead interacts with nickel-bearing allcys, but not with
iio cr graphite. Traps at certain points in the circuit culd locate
the positicn of lead .eakage.

The centainment building will catch leakage of volatile fission
products from the primary circuit or blanket tc the air, similar
tc MSRE, with appropriate detection and leaktight barriers.
3.6.3.2 Loss of flow. Leaks, pipe break, heat exchanger plugging,
and pump failure can all reduce flow in the primary circuit. Figure
3.6~3 analyzes the consequences. In most events the reactar shuts
down and the fuel drains to a safety tank; there fission product
decay and delayed neutron—induced fission continue to generate
heat, but the high capacity of the salt restrains the temperature
rise,

The effect of a single pump failure depends upcn the primary
circuit arrangement. With single pumps per channel (Plan A in Fig.
3.2~8) failure of cne pump would shut down one whole core channel.
The fuel sait in that core chanrcl must then drain out to stop full
pover production in it. Subsequent replacement by void, blanket, or
carrier salt would cause a large loss of reactivity thereby shutting
down the reactor unless

(2) Missing reactivity could be added through enrichment
enhancement
Then ane could continue operation on a reduced scale, Cee 6/7 for
six out of seven channels still operating, until a more opportune
time occurred in which to drain the whole core and replace male
functioning equipnaent.

With multiple subchannels per core channel, each with pumps
and exchangers as in Fig. 3.2-8-B, C and D, failure of one pump
still allows partial reactor operation until a better time for shut-
down and repair. If one operated the Plen B or C subchannels or
the plan D heat exchanger at less than full efficiency, then their
full use is available in the event of one subchannel failure. This
would however, increase out-of-core inventory and capital costs
though. Should the core tubes be connected in series as in Section
3.2.6.4 then any in-~core malfunction (leak or pipe break) would
require system shutdown.

Should both regular and emergency power supply fail, all
pumps would fail unless they are steam turbine driven. However,
electrically driven pumps are easier to include in the containment
and also easier to supply for pre-testing, etc. Inertia would
help electric pump run-down rates, or some short-term auxiliary
supply might have tc be provided until full dump of fuel has taken
place. The fluid could also drain through a "freeze valve" by
gravity into a natural-convection cooled tank which has a non-
critical geometry.

In the event that flow ceases and core salt remains in place,

321
the strong negative temperature coefficient will cantrol the temp-
erature and power: initial temperature increase will decrease
density, which decreases reactivity and thereby power, until some
equilibrium state is reached. HCFR(Pu) studies [29] with a simpli-
fied reactor model showed that the temperature rise of the salt for a
reactivity step of up to $1 should be less than 300°C; for 7 pumps

failing out of 8, less than 230°C.

 

In summary, it appears that reactor stability concern over
out=of-core inventory may preclude the use of ocut~of=core subchannels
as well as dictate series ccnnection of the core channels. This
means designing the system fcr high reliability to minimize shut-—
down and for rapid repair of heat exchangers, piping, and pumps
wnen shutdown does occur. Rapid repair will entail expedient removal
of all the core salt followed by a salt flushing of all radioactivity
from the system. The strang temperature coefficient should disspell

any criticality accident cancerns.

322
3.6.3.3 Structural failure. Failure of the tubes separating core
and blanket would lead to no chemical or compatibility problems.
Dilution of the core salt will reduce reactivity; only if core salt
were replenished as it entered and displaced the blanket, could a
reactivity increase occur. Zven then the system could accomodate
temperzture rise from moderate salt additions, as ample margin
exists above operating temperature on a short term basis. The
limit to the permissible rate of such salt additian needs to be
established.

Vessel failure would require rapid dumping from both the
circuit and the catchpots. Dump tanks should probably be sized
to centain the contents of cne secondary coolant circuit as well
as all core and blanket salt. Relief valves on the secondary
system will protect the primary circuit from pressurization result-
ing from a major steam generator failure into the secondary system.

In the event of a major circuit failure operating pressure
would play an important role in the subsequent fate of the fission
products and the containment, The molten salts themselves ex-
hibit low vapor pressures. Although high pumping losses can cause
primary circuit pressures up fo 460 psi, lead secondary coolant
acts essentially like a hydraulic system with little stcred energy.
Missile formation is therefore unlikely and it should be possible

to demonstrate a containment which will not be breached from this

cause.

323
 

With a high-pressure helium—cooled system one must ask whether
an accident might aerosolize the core salt. However, a properly-
designed reactor vessel could withstand the full helium pressure from
a severe rupture between the coolant and primary circuits. Thus
release of activity to the reactor containment cell would not occur
except under a simultoneous double failure. The cell itself is
small and can economically be made in the form of a prestressed
vessel to withstand missile damage and to act as an additional
barrier to fission product release. A final low pressure building
cantainment would prevent release from smail leaks in the earlier

containment stages.

3.6.3.4 Zmergency cooling. Unlike solid fuel, molten salt can quickly
transfer into a geometrically-safe tank. Gravity can provide a
failsafe transfer method from reactor to holding tank (Figure 3.2-11):
a pipe wherein the salt is normally kept frozen would open naturally
upen loss of electric power.

In the tank, the salt will circulate naturally as heat from
fission product decay transfers through tube walls to air convected
by natural draft towers. Ctherwise pressure would build up from salt
vaporization. The absence of mechanical moving parts will make this
whole system hizhly reliable; multiplicity could add even further in-
tegrity. A forced draft system would probably layout more compactly

and cheaply.

324
 

A second cooling option would circulate naturally a low melting=
point salt or NaK through U=-tubes in the tank to boiling water heat
exchangers, Air-cooled condensers situated in a normal or forced draft
stack would condense ‘the steam formed, Alternatively, the heat could
transfer directly to a large boiling pool, thus accomodating decay heat
for a protracted period without makeup. Condensers or make-up water
would be provided for continuous operation,

A catchall salt bed below this apparatus would serve as a backup
for any leaks or breaks, The heat of salt formation would greatly
aid in absorbing decay energy. An independent cooling system might
remove decay heat. The bed would also dilute the fuel salt. Proper
choice of tank diameter would insure subcriticality.

Recovery from emergency tanks or beds would require heaters,
drains, and pumps. When carrier or blanket salt is added for dilu-
tion and/or heat absorction by latent heat of formation, a method

tc separate out the dump salt would also be needed,

325
 

3.6.3.5 Comparison of MSRs to others. MSRs should be biologically
safer because

1. The plant continuously removes volatile fission products

2. The fuel is already molten and in contact with materials

designed for that condition.

The removal of volatiles fram the primary circuit still requires
attention to their presence elsewhere in the plant. However, it
should not be difficult to insure the integrity of a storage medium
below ground. After a suitable decay period same of the gases may be
releasable to the atmosphere.

In the event a pump fails or other flow loss occurs, the only
concern 1s that decay heat might build up vaporization pressure,
However, the same coils which preheat the fluid could also cool the

fluid.

3.6.3.6. Precipitation out of eutectic mixtures. After the temperature
of a salt mixture falls to the solidification point, the compositim
of liquid changes, sliding along the liquidus curve as crystals
separate out (Figure 3.6-4). With low initial UC, molar content,
cooling precipitates out NaCl crystals, thereby enriching the fluid
in UCls. With high initial UC, molar content, cooling produces Cl,
crystals and NaCl-enriched fluid. In either case the liquid migrates
to the nearest eutectic point (nadir) composition and causes a concen~
tration of ucl,. Thus one must consider possible criticality situ
ations and design geometries to prevent them. Probably precipitation

of uCl, crystals from a UCl,=-rich fluid is the less-serious case,

3.6.3.7 Boiling off of salt mixtures. In the event that the carrier

salt had a boiling point much lower than that of the actinide chlorides,
one could postulate a positive temperature coefficient contribution in

that temperature region. Fortunately evidence from section 3.3.3.5

contradicts this: carrier salts appear to be less volatile than

actinide chlorides.

327
3.6.3.8 Containment. Solid fuel plants generally feature triple
containment: fuel element, reactor vessel, and than the contain-
ment building. The MCFR will feature reduced FP radioactivity due
to continuous gas cleanup but it will inherently have only double
containment of piping and a building. A second radiation hazard
arises from activation of the secondary coolant and nearby equipment
by delayed neutrons in the primary circuit,

Te further contain these hazards, a low-pressure leak~tight
membrane might be formed around the walls, floors and ceiling of
the reactor system. This membrane can also form part of the duct-
ing for the inert gas circulaticn required to cool the concrete
structure and shielding and inhibit vessel oxidation. Heat losses
with insulation restricting the concrete temperatures to below 70°C
would be about 200 watts/n° with 40 cm of insulation. This would
equate to about 3 M{ total heat removal by water or air cooling.

The main building would constitute the tertiary containment.
Its volume must be sufficient to contain the stored emergy of any
gases present. In the lead-cooled design these are cover gas vol-
umes al low to moderate pressure. The helium~cooled version may
require a larger outer containment volume and/or intermediate pre-

stressed concrete containment(Sec. 3.6.3.3)

3,6.3.9 Resistance to external threat. (ne can postulate a number
of scenarios wherein external explosion or impact threatens the
reactor integrity directly or through a loss-of-coolant accident.
These could involve ground or aerial bombs, planes, and space re-
entry projectiles (e.g. meteors, missiles, space laboratory), by

either accident or intention. An individual, a subnational group,

328
 

or another country might intentionally initiate. Nature threatens
with earthquakes, tornadoes, and dam breaks.

In many or most of thase situations one could anticipate the
danger. Most reactors already lie below ground level. Still the
vessels generally sit high enough to be rupture-~prone to strong
explosions cr impacts. Such an incident could release volatized
fission products and actinides of consequence greatly exceeding
a simple bomb cr other initiating event.

To protect against these threats an MCFR could uniquely trans-
fer its fuel to a storage tank (section 3.6.3.3), located remotely

under additicnal earth (Figure 3.65) or in an otherwise hardened

not burn, but will support combustion with solids such as wood, coke,

spray sprinklers or low-velocity fog nozzles provides good fire

3.7 Fuel Processing (17, 81, 141-146]

This section analyzes the chemical aspects of the reactor fuel
cycle: principally preparation of the ThCl, blanket fuel and repro-
cessing of irradiated blanket and core salts,

Some processing should occur continously, some batchwise, Ratch-
wise will generally be easier, more efficient in separation, and more
economical, This study does not deal with the near-identical concerns
associated with starting early cores up with PuCl, or “uo, instead

ThO, is converted to Trl, , mixed with reprocessed blanket
salt, and fed into the blanket simultaneous with blanket salt
removal. Blanket reprocessing separates out bred UCL, (pre~
dominantly Aye, ), reduces it to UCL;, and admixes that to
reprocessed core salt, forming the core shim material. This
constitutes a spiked fuel, suitable for BG export as well as
for positive reactivity shim to the MIFR(Th) core (simultaneous
with irradiated core salt removal).

Core salt reprocessing removes fission products, oxides,
corrosion products, and chlorine transmutation products part
continuously and part batchwise. It also readjusts the chlorine
stoichiometry.

3.7.1 Principal Salt Reprocessing Methods

The MSR ccncept inherently avoids many of the caventicnal
reprocessing stages, especially fuel element dissolution and
refabrication. The absence of these stages removes the need for

high decontamination stages in reprocessing. Proliferation cecncerns

330
 

also discourage high decontamination: residual radioactivity

makes weapen construction hazardous. Eliminating ail these stages

reduces costs.

This leaves just the separation stages: core salt cleanup and

bred-U extraction frcm the blanket. The most promising methods are by

1. Solvent extracticn from aqueous soluticn
2. Volatility

3. Pyrometallurgy

L. Pyrochemistry (molten salt electrolysis)

“le first review the chemistry of the heavy elements.

3.7.1.1 Chemistry of the heivy elements [31]. The separation
processes, especially those based on solvent extraction, take ad-
vantage of the somewhat unusual chemical behavicr of the actinides.
Elements in the analcgous lanthanide series all exhibit similar
chemistry: the presence of three, relatively loosely-bound, outer

electrons causes each atom to exhibit a positive valence of 3,

The actinides also all form a tripositive (III) valence
state. However, some also evidence loosely-bound irmer elec-
trons. This leads to tetrapositive (IV), pentapositive (V),
and hexaspositive (VI) states.

These higher oxidation states evidence different stabilities
(rable 3.7-I) which facilitates extraction and separation of the
heavy elements. Th and U differ pronouncedly, Th evidencing

mostly just the IV state.

Tre IIT and IV states easily precipitate from aqueous soluticn
as flucrides; the V or VI states do not. The fluorides of the
IIT and IV states do not volatilize; the VI-state fluorides do
at fairly low temperatures. The IV and VI states appreciably
dissolve in certain organic liquids; the III-state nitrates remain
virtually insoluble in these liquids.
3.7.1.2 Solvent extracticn from aqueous solution. The extraction
of actinides from aqueous solution by an organic solvent is the
most advanced process: it has been widely used since about 1951.
The Thorex version extracts 233 U from aqueous soluticn of irradiated

Tn fuel elements [72]. It relies cn the stability differences

332
between Th and U in higher valence states (Table 3.7-I).

without consuming additional heat or chemicals particularly benefits

1. Situations requiring extreme purification. Use of enough
stages can lower the gamma activity from fission products
in the extracted urznium tc below that of naturzi uranium.
Thus cne might not want to furnish this capability to a
foreign nation.

2. Situaticns where ths properties of two metals parallel
one aricther so clcsely that a single precipitaticn or
crystallization can not separate to the degree required.

Thus this method may not be needed for Th-U separation.

 

The dissoluticn step for a chloride salt has to be the simplest
of all: Just add water. Different organic sclvents separately
extract the U, Th, and wastes. Addition of Cl, and cel, subsequently
rechloridizes U and Th.

Disadvantages associated with this method include

l. Extra criticality precautions fer H-mederated fuel soluticns

2. Multiplicity and complexity of steps

3. Large waste volumes

Le. Large shielded space required

5. Additional steps needed to produce solid wastes,
3.7.1.3 Volatility processes. Volatile UFy (b.p. 56.4°C) easily
separates from fission product and Th fluorides. The ability to de-
contaminate to low activity levels parallels that for solvent evtrac=.

tion. However, the volatility method requires fewer steps and therefore

333
smaller volumes of highly-radioactive wastes compared with aquecus
processing,

Volatilization should work especially well for processing a
ThE, fliaf (cr other fluoride carrier) blanket salt mix. Cne would
oxidize +he bred UF, to UFg, separate it by distillation, chloridize

kL

it, and reduce it to uel, . The remaining ThF

1 would return to the

blanket.

Distilling uc,» UCL, or UCL, from a mix of ThCl, and chlorides
of the structural materials and fissicn products would be more diffi
cult: more volatile chlorida2s compounds exist and their vapor-~pres-
sure ranges overlap, Howev:zr, considerable less develooment effort
has been expended on methods for separating volatile chlorides; the

problems may be solvable,

3.7.1.4 Pyrometallurgical processing. In the 1950's ANL developed
pyrometallurgical processes to recover and purify fissile ang fertile
material from breeder reactors. Although demcnstrated on a pilot-
plant scale, much engineering development remained to evolve a
workable and reliable process, especially in view of criticality
restrictions.

A typical process would use a molten chloride flux to contact
the oxide fuel and a molten metal to extract the actinide. Hence the
need for high temperature (pyro). With molten chloride salt fuels
anly the extractant is needed: for chloride fuels, Dillon [28]
proposed a Mg-Zn alloy. A similar metal may work with Th/U cycle
chlorides.

Pyrometallurgical processes decontaminate by factors of only

334
about one hundred. With them one must handle fuel remotely. This
poses no problem for molten salt processing: it requires no fuel
fabrication or other handling; everything is done remotely anyhow.
Leaving in radioactivity also inhibits use of the material for
Weapons.

Because of its compactness, pyrometallurgical process can operate
ciose-coupled to the reactcr and cn a mich shorter cycle than the
aquecus rcute. If economical, a pyrochemical processing plant could
easily be acccmodated within the reactor building due to its small
size. Preliminary work indicates that capital and operating costs
may be high because of the small batch type operaticns needed.

Detracticns include lcw recovery rates and the development

needed to cope with temperatures zbove 1000°z, High temperature

Equipment of great reliability that can be operated and replaced
remotely is hard to design and expensive to test. However, work

already done indicates that the difficulties may be overcome.

3.7.1.5 Molten salt electrolysis. Techniques exist to deposit
actinide oxides and carbides from molten salt sclution through
electrolytic reduction [143] e.g.

U6," (soln) + 26” == UC, (solid)
at the cathode. At thes anode:

2C1 (soln) == Cl (gas) + 2e”
Similarly Taube [147] mentioned reducing actinides directly in their
melten chloride mixture. The Cl, released could be used to chloridize

ThC, for blanket feed (section 3.7.7).

335
 

3.7.2 Core Salt Processing

Cn equilibrium cycle, the core fuel will include carrier alkali
salt (e.g. NaCl), fissile ucl,, ¢iluent hel, , actinide transmutants
(e.g. Pacl, , NpCl,, and Pucl;), impurity oxides, fission products in
various forms and states (section 3.4.2.1), structural corrosion
products, and sul fur (from chlorine transmutation). Some of the
mutants may ferm complex chlorides like Cs UCL and compounds like
UI and US, which precipitate out at sundry temperatures.
Core shim material rust replace irradiated core salt near-
cantinuously so as te maintain criticality. The fuel burnup rate’
(1.6 gm/min for a 2250 Mth plant) fixes the rate of shim replacement.
Actual core salt reprocessing can still occur batchwise or continuously.
The chcice will depend in part on the allowable inventory of core salt
in reprocessing and the allowable level of FP concentrations in the
core. The latter depends an

3.7.2.2 Continuous removal of mutant gases. Fission produces Se,
Xe, Kr, I,, and Bry, which are all gases at reactor temperatures
(section 3.4.2.1). Threshold reactions also produce He and HT gas.
Cne toa of fuel from the core of a fast breeder contains 2 x 10% Ci
or Sr, 100 Ci of Ble (after cooling 4 months), 130 and 0.7 Ci
or Bh (after cooling 4 and 6 months, respectively), 0.13 Ci

of 29, and 2200 Ci of T. In an MSR circuit rupture, these wculd
all present a radiation hazard. Gas accumulation will also build
up pressure, affecting circulation,

In remedy for the MSBR CENL proposed a cleanup system which
recirculates gas in lcops across each main salt pump. Injected
helium nucleates bubbles which absorb gases, the small-particle
fog of inert metals (Pd, Te,Ru,Rh, and Te) and some of the volatile’
chlorides (Fig. 3.7-1). “hile in a hold-up tank to reduce decay
heat, some of the metals and chlorides deposit out. Passage through
traps and beds removes Kr, Xe, water, etc., before returning to the
helium injector. About 207% of the bypass flow undergces a long delay
in which all isotopes except the 1l(-year 8%r decay to an insignificant
level.

Presently 85%: levels from reactors are small enough to discharge
directly to the atmosphere. Should nuclear power abound in 30-40
years it may be necessary to separate out 8%, low=temperature
fractionation looks like a promising method.

Eveporation and fractionation can also concentrate tritium for

lengthy storage; this is presently done in solid fuel reprocessing.

The main design parameters for gaseous fission product removal

2. The heat removal needed to avoid excessive temperature

Cne form of delay bed im a trough of swimming pool size. Low pressure
steam forms above the pool and passes to condenser units. Such a system
would dwarf the reactor in size. Alternatively, one might store the
gases safely and reliably at high pressure.
3.7.2.3 ‘Removal of non-rasecus fission products. The inert metals
(section 3.4.2.1) not escaping as fog will likely deposit in var—
ious parts of the primary or FP removal circuits. 3xternal processing
will remove the remaining 50-60% of the fission products as nec=

essary unless on-line treatment processes can be developed.

Section 3.7.1 mentions three possible processing methods.

Cf these solvent extraction from aqueous solution is the best
established. lcwever, economics may require the reprocessing plant
to serve rultiple reactor facilities. Reprocessing at a different
location, would mean

1. Increased out-of-plant inventory

2. Increased hazard of radioactivity, sabotage, and pro-

liferation
Combined with the disadvantages menticned in Secticn 3.7.1.2 this
argues for consideration of the less-developed processes of section
3.7.1.
3.7.2.4 Contrcl of the oxy. en levels, Cxyzen and oxygen—cantaining
compounds react with ucl, to precipitate uranium ori des and oxy-—
chlorides. Oxygen can enter the salt through air, water vapor or
transmutation of F, The vagarious nature of air and water vapor
entry necessitates keeping the oxygen content well below saturation.
A continuous gas bubbling system (with chemical reducing agent)
should help; so should the appreciable capacity of the salt for
oxygen.

Experiment indicates difficulty with simple methods of salt
cleanup such as the small change in solubility by temperature
adjustment. An alternative effective method routes the bypass
gas flow through a bed, where the gas mixes continuously with
injected liquid NaAlCl, . Greater stability of Al,Gq causes it
to form over AlCl, (Fig. 3.7-3). The solid alumina then separates

out by filtration or cyclone.

3e7e2s5 Removal of sulfur impurities. Several nuclear reactions
convert chlorine to sulfur (Figure 3.7-4). Mass balance and Coulomb
barriers combine to inhibit most of these reactions, but high flux
levels bolster production, 3a converts to 32g. 33s, and 36s, 3Te1
should produce only small amounts of 34g (favoring a 3a enrichment
2gzin)e A natural chlorine-fuelled system will produce more sulfur
than the sali solubility can handle. Phosphorus, though present is
only transitory, decaying quickly to sulfur.

The presence of sulfur, or of any other element capable of
compounding with uranium, need not adversely affect the feasibil-
ity of the system: simple zdjustment of temperature and uel,
content can induce precipitztion in a clean-up circuit. Because
ane can reliably predict the production rate of these mutants,
the concentrations in the core could be safely maintained close
to saturations then even an inefficient removal process would
suffice.

The effect of the sulfur presence will, in part, depend on its
oxidation state. For molten sulfur, the oxidation-state equi-
librium is fairly well fixed; the predominant state fends to be
positive (Fig. 3.7-5). The "positivity" also increases with
irradiation (Fig. 3.7-6).
3,7.2.6 Maintaining the chlcrine stoichiometry. Zach actinide atom
initially binds three or four Cl atoms. Although fission splits
each actinide atom into two product atcms, the net valency reduces

(in part due to inert gases) and an excess of chlorine occurs.

This can lead tc several corrosion agents, especially ucl,. (The

long-lived salts might simply be to use them as carrier salts SrCl,
and CsCl. Unlike natural Sr ard Cs, they would not increase in
radiological hazard, but rather decrease, This would also apply to
some of the other fission products, especially RbCl znd Ball,.
3.7.2.8 Comparison to MSBR reprocessing. In FSBR reprocassing
of the fuel salt (Fig. 3.7-7) a volatility prccess (Section 3.7.1.3)
first extracts uranium and immediately returns it to the primary
circuit. Subsequent steps proceed more siowly and sometimes tor—
tuously. They especially include 233pa extraction by a liquid
bismuth contact process and rare earth extraction. After 233pa
decays to 233y, it returns i> the reactcr.

M5BZs must carefully handle tritium gas produced by bri
(n, oL ) reacticns: releases to the environment must be strictly
centrolled.

Reprocessing for an HCFR(Th) should be much simpler: enhanced
233p, and 23 fissionability makes it unnecessary to separate and

hold up 233p,, Also an HCFR produces magnitudes-less tritium,

3.7.3 Blanket Salt Processing

Blanket salt processing must extract uel, and convert it
to UCL. Some degree of separation may be initially accomplish-
ed by slowly cooling the sali mix to precipitate out ThCl L
until a eutectic composition is reached (Fig. 3.61).

A low need for high purity plus a desire for compactness
favor pyroprocessing with chlorides. Should the blanket salt
be a fluoride, oxidation to UFy and subsequent distillation
(section 3.7.3.8) appeals.

Ucl L reduces to UCl, reratively easy using Hoy alkali
(Na,K,etcs), U, or Th. For metallic reduction, rod, gauze
or turnings are popular. Using alkali (Ak = Na or K), the
chemical reaction is

ueL, + Ak ——y UCL, + AkCL
This results in a 50/50 molar mix; lower in uranium content
than desired. Any AkCl initially present would even further
reduce the uel, molar content. This leaves culy Th or H,
as alternatives.

Th metal is toxic and flammable. H, produces HCl, which in
turn might be used to chlorinate the thorium oxide feed (section
3.7.7). A possible direct route to reducing uel, may. be by
electrolysis, releasing Cl, which could, in turn, chlorinate Tho,

feed.

Blanket salt should well accord batch reprocessing. The frequency
of blanket reprocessing will depend on

233

characteristics of the squilibrium U cycls. It also avoids
mining new uranium (at a rate of 10C0 parts U fer 72 parts 235)
and uses up existing stocks of Pu.
This conflicts with ihe desire to avoid Pu, but requires only the

ate the desimm !NCFR(Th).

3.7.5 Fuel Cycle Summary

Fig. 3.7-9 summarizes a typical HCFR(Th) fuel cycle. On equi-
librium cycle an MCFR(Th) blanket consumes natural thorium and breeds
Per, . Blanket reprocessing separates out the uct, , reduces it
to UCl,, and feeds it into the core as shim. Small anounts of Th,
2h and 2% also carry over in chloride form.

Continuous core reprocessing should result in

1. Gases vented tc atmosphere following suitable decay

2, Very small long-lived FP waste which could remain at the
plant until the end of the plant life

3. No actinide waste

L. A few.commercial byproducts, e.g. S, non-radioactive IP,
and possibly ER and Bes radiation sources

5. Renovated core salt still highly radioactive, mixed in

with the blanket product shim. Most of this radicactive,
weapons-grade mix returns to the core, but some goes out
as BG in a form nan-conducive to intimate handling.

Section 2.5.2 advocates minimum transport of weapons-grade
and radioactive material. The one shipment of starter fuel in

and shipment of BG out constitutes the only major transport, nil

compared to the usual reactor fuel cycle.

352
 

3.8 Safeguards

3.5.1 National Fuel Inventory

Although cut—of-core cooling greatly increases the fuel in-
ventory in the primary circuit, fuel safeguards does not suffer:

1. Fuel diversion from the primary circuit requires shut-

ting down the operating power plant

2. High radicactivity makes diversicn unwieldy.

The inventory in the reprocessing stream will depend cn the
reprocessing mode (batchwise vs. continuous) and on the reprccessing
goals (degree of separations, The only other fuel accumulaticns
will be in ths shim tank enc in the brzeding gain expert, both
highly radiocactive.

The absence of fuel febrication and fuel element reprecessing,
and associated transportation eliminates most out~of-plant inven-
tory. Thus, unlike other reactor fuel cycles, the national in-

ventory of an MCFR basically comprises only the power plant inven-—

tories.
3.8.2 In-plznt Diversicn Potential

FP and 232 daughter radioactivity in the molten fuel should
discourage diversion prior to reprocessing. Selective reprocessing
could remove just the neutron absorbers and corrosive agents,
while allowing high-activity non-volatile emitters to remain.

(This would simultaneously manage some of the cumberscme waste).
After appreciable reactcr cperaticn, long-term radicactivity and heat

generation rates may prohibit salt use for ieapons.

353
The most sensitive (weapons-attractive) material should be the
low=burnup ucl, or ucl, extracted from the blanket, Processing re-
motely and then mixing immediately with (reprocessed) radioactive
core salt should safeguard the LCL, lo stage should ever hold
encugh low-burnup uel, to warrant seizure for quick bomb

manufacture.

J.8.3 Facility “feodificaticn

Presumably a country could modify its MCFR(Th) to produce Pu
by simply substituting ue, fer hel, in the blanket. This could
te dene either in the salt scution or in a separate capsule.

But then a research reactor c= other neutrcn sources would serve
almecst as well. Thus safeguards cannot prohibit such steps: they
can only seek to induce ramifications to, and external signals of,
such medification. Signals would include higher heat production
in the blanket and fewer 2.6-bieV photons from 232 daughters.
Designing a blanket with limited heat remcval capability should

preclude significant Pu manufacture.
3.8... Desired Radioactivity in Transported Breeding Gain

The best opportunities for diversion or theft of core salt
would occur with stockpiles and transports of breeding gain. Still
even though the fuel be packaged for safe handling in transport,
the presence oi 252 daughters and radioactive fission products in
the fuel will make it unattractive for handling in weapcns con-
struction. Furthermore, this radicactivity will necessitate un-

3.8.5 FRadlolorical Sabotaze Threat

Fission reactors inherently induce high levels of radioactivity.
A terrorist could deliberately release radioactive gases and, by
means of explosive devices, radicactive aerosols. Although an
13k plant ccntinucusly purge. its fuel, much of the problem re-
mains: the same amcunt of fission products have still been gen-
erated per lJe and must eventually be disposed of (transported
from in-plant safe storage to some final safe sterage). Cnly
semipermanent storage at the MSR site can alleviate.the transpor-
tation risk relative to other reactors. But even then, such a
high fission product concentration might also attract saboteurs.

In contrast, a fusien reactor produces only tritium which is
conceivably dispersable. In-plant recycling further mitigates the
problem. However, the only near-term economical fusion reactor is
projected to be the hybrid which will produce weapons-grade fissile

fuel again.

355
 

3.9 Access and Maintenance

The geals for sll nuclear pewer plants include efficient,
reliable, and safe reactor operation. This entails adeguate
inspection and opportunity for maintenance and repair. ith !MSRs
one can drain the fuel, flush the system with clean salt, and then
replace the whole reactor vessel or individual heat exchanger
tnits. However, with out-of-core cooling, the primary circuit
emits delayed neutrons; these activate circuit equipment and the

secondary coclant, inhibiting access and maintenance there.
3.9.1 Ccmpactness of an [CFR

Figure 3.91 indicates tke compact laycut of an MCFR and
compares its cverall size to that for a typical L:FBR and a
lower-powered MSER. In British CFR(Pu) designs, no item of
plant exceeds 6.5 m diameter; this permits prefabrication of the
vessel in the shop, thus reducing construction time and interest

charges.
3.9.2 Intrinsic Peliability

The MSR avoids intricate mechanical devices: it needs

1. Mo complex refuelling mechanisms

2. Tew of the clcse tolerances present in solid-fuelled re-
actors

3. No mechanicai control devices in the core or blanket.

This implies the high system reliability of a chemical or hydraulic

356
plant: pumps, heat exchangers, and containing materials will cperate
reliably sc leng as they do not excsed proven limits of corrcosicn,

thermal expansion, and salt velccity.

3.9.3 SRT Zxoerience

MSRZ demonstrated that with proper design cne cen maintain an
active fluic-fuel system without unduz difficulty. Such design
should entail easy replacement of pump and heat exchanger or in-
situ repair. As an example, a U-tube heat exchanger allows the
major components to expand znd zlso permits plugging any leaking
tubes from the less-active coolant circuit side. These features

do cost some extra fuel inventory though.

3.9.4 Comparison of Primary Circuit Configurations

In nuclear reactors radiation inhibits access to the primary cir-
cuit, The liquid nature of MCFR fuel allows the removal of most
of the radiation sources during reactor shutdown.

(ne would like to design the primary circuit to allow reduced—
power operation while repairing a small ox-core portion of it in a
shielded cell (Fig. 3.9=2). Then removal of ane "tube" circuit from
operation would still leave (n-1)/n of the reactor in operation. Ad-

versely the primary circuit must lie close to the core so as to min-

imize out—of-core fuel inventory.

357
Because of this the radiation fields of the core and adjacent sub-~
channels overlap, Therefore unless robots can do the job, replacement
or repair of any component (heat exchangers, pump, piping, etc.) will
probably require removal of all the radiation sources: i.e., shut
down and clean out of the whole reactor,

In that event one might ask, are multiple loops in each sub-
channel still needed? Probably they still buy you time fo wait until
a scheduled maintenance period occurs - like that for replacing the

in-core tubes,

3.9.5 Reactor Maintenance/Peplacement Procedure

Upon shutdown the core fluid may drain or be pumped into safe
geometry tanks. Cperators could then flush the primary circuits,
first with (irradiated) blanket salt and then with fresh blanket
mix. The latter might first clean up tie blanket region
itself. Each mix would need a separate drain tank. Both tanks
and lines might require auwdliary heating. ‘ater or steam couid
acccmplish the final! cleznup: chiorides dissolve easiiy in water.

#ith a clean system, operators could decouple and replace the
graphite tubes just like fuel elements, only much faster:

1. lo delay time is needed for radioactivity to die down

2. Low radicactivity gr2atly eases the handling problems

3. Spent tubes will require no extensive storage as for spent

fuel elements; they should be easily disposed of, |

Le. Cnly a few (N=3-6) tubes are involved.

Core tubes will probably require the most frequent replace-
ment of all the solid reactor companents due to the combined effects
of radiation, corrosion, and high temperature. Frequency of re-
placement might be similar to that for LiR and LIFBR refuelling
(6-12 mos). Even more frequent intervals can be tolerated without
significant penalty. The costs of replacement tubes will be neg-
ligible also. (ne would like to remove the tubes without dis-
turbing the reactor vessel. (nce in a great while, the reactor

vessel or a graphite vessel liner could also be replaced,

3.9.6 Reactor Shielding

Cut-cf-core ccoling may cause scme unique shielding problems

359
due to the circulation of delayed neutron emitters. Assuming a

In summary, an unshielded 5~in pipe will produce delayed neutron
fluxes of the order 102 — 10° n cn? sect nearby.

This flux level could appreciably activate the primary circuit
environment, causing delay and difficulty in maintenance. Routing
alternate subchannels through separate shielded cells outside the
vessel (Fig. 3.7-1) would parily circumvent the problem: then if
one subchannel broke down, the operctor could divert flow to another.
After a suitable decay time the broken subcircuit could be entered
and fixed.

The delayed neutron radiztion stems from relatively short-lived
emitters; it will quickly stop once reactor operation does. The high
gamma radiation from fission and activation products lasts much

longer: it will continue during shutdown. Continuous fission

product cleanup helps to keep these gamma radiation levels down.
3.9.7 Radiation Sources in Reprocessing Equipment

Section 3+5.10.1 reported the neutron production from decay
alphas. To avoid these neutrons, the process should avoid use
of light elements, especially Be,F, B, Li, Al, 0, Mg, and Na
(in decreasing order of importance).

The presence of 23 25 » especially in core salt reprocessing,
will also produce penetrating radiation. Section 3.5.10.2 dis~

cusses this in more detail.

361
3.10 Auxiliary Plant

3.10.1 Power Cycle Options

Generally the primary coolant transfers heat to
1. An intermediate liquid coolant which generates steam for
a. turbine, or to
2. A gas coolant which passes directly to high-efficiency gas
turbines and/or process heat applications,
Melting point, corrosion, and activation (by delayed neutrons) con-

stitute the main concerns in the auxiliary plant.

3.10.1.1 Tntermediate liquid coolant for steam cycle. Liquid
metals and fused salts, beczuse of their high boiling points
and thermal conductivities allow operation at high temperatures
and low pressures. This promates excellent heat transfer with
out expensive and hazardous high pressure equipment. Low pressure
especially permits use of thin heat-exchanger tubes.

Research earlier on Na-graphite reactors and later on LMFBRs
has produced a broad base of Na technology. Similar technology
exists for the low-melting eutectic Na-K mixture. Either one, but
especially NaK, avoids problems of coolant freezing. NASA-Lewis
has also pioneered the use of K with a K-vapor turbine, getting up
to 65% efficiency. That cycle would probably need more study though.

Unfortunately, alkali metals react vigorously with both steam
and molten salt. A small leak on the high-pressure steam side could
spell disaster. If the alkali leaked into the molten salt , removal

by processing would be hard. Sodium would react with UCl, to form

362
NaCl and pure U metal; the latter could plate out or otherwise
accumulate.

Lead behaves better chemically as it reacts little with either
salt or steam and should not enlarge any leaks. Lead costs a lot
but that has not discouraged the British from choosing it. It will
require development of suitable pumps and components especially in
regards to corrosion. The inertia associated with lead's high density
will also require high strength construction.

Lead will need auxiliary heating to prevent freezing during
low power and start-up conditions. The cooler parts of the lead
circuit could use low alloy steels but regions above 500°C may
require other materials: the superheater will need duplex tubing

as lead attacks nickel-bearing alloys.

Molten salts compete favorably with liquid metals: they
exhibit thermal conductivities intermediate to water and the
poorer of the liquid -metazls., Their specific heat capacities parallel
water's. Furthermore, an intermediate coolant of molten salt
should - more closcly match the primary salt in physical proper—
ties, thereby reducing freezing and thermal stress problems.
They will cost far less then liquid metals. Table 3.10-1 shows
that a wide choice in eutectic melting points exists among
candidate salt mixtures.

Considerable experience exists in pumping and general use
of molten salts, especially in salt baths and petroleum refining
apolications which feature constant high temperatures and con—

tinuous system operation. Salts work well with Hastelloy N.

However steam leakage into the coolant salt could produce
locally high corrosion. Processing difficulties would arise
if the coolant leaked into the fuel salt. For these latter
reasons the British decided against molten salts for the sec-

ondary coolant.

3.10.1.2 Coolant for gas cycle. co, or other oxidizing gas leak-
ing into the fuel salt, would react to form U0, That could over-
load the oxide removal section of the salt cleanup plant.

Inert helium avoids this problem. He cooling is also under
development for other reactors along with a He gas turbine. It
should work well with molybdenum heat exchanger tubing although
this is not yet fully endorsed.

Both France and the Soviet Union are considering gaseous

364
aluminous chloride to power the first stage of gas turbines; dis-
sociating M0, (ND, gas, the second stage.

Lower turbine working pressure with gas should permit more
component prefabrication, That should lower installation times
and save on construction and interest charges. Avoiding the steam
generator and tertiary circuit also reduces costs, the extent
depending upon the gas cycle efficiency.

Poor heat transfer properties of gas will penalize the cycle
with a larger heat exchanger. This means higher out-of-core fuel
salt inventory. One must also analyze the safety of a pressurized

secondary coolant.

3.10.2 Auxi.iary Hardware

3.10.2.1 Pumps. Pumps that circulate molten salts experience un-
usual metallurgical, chemical, physical and mechanical conditions.
Salts exhibit temperature-dependent physical properties. At tem—
peratures near 700°C they corrode many structural materials and
deteriorate chemically if exposed to air, water or water vapor.

ORNL successfully tested single-stage centrifugal salt pumps
in the MSRE and in loops at 650°C up to 16,000 hours. Two-stage
semi=axial pumps may require basic development work. Both pump
designs will require development and testing to successfully in-
crease sizes to the range needed for a 1000 MWe plant.

Both pump designs separate the high-temperature pumping ele-
ments from the primary shaft seal and bearings: this allows the
latter parts to operate near ambient temperatures and to use con-

ventional lubricants. An inert gas buffers the space between the

365
high-temperature pumped salt and the primary pump shaft seal.
Elastomeric seals and lubricants must be protected from excessive
gamma heating and radiation damage.

Initially, mechanical pump designs avoided rubbing parts in the
salts; now pumps with journal bearings in the salt have operated
successfully.

No direct experience exists with high power, continuously—
running lead pumps. The design principles would probably follow
the sodium pump design developed for IMFBRs but with higher power

and strength requirements.

3.10.2.2 Core/blanket seal. Section 3.7 emphasizes guarding against
core fluid leaks more than tlianket leaks. Therefore, the core tubes
should be a single entity throughout the reactor with no pressure
seal between core and blanket salt.

One solution might be to route the core tubes through a second
tube or sleeve which penetrates the reactor vessel. However, such
a sleeve will itself experience high radiation damage and require
replacement. It would also thermalize neutrons. Thus we prefer to
create a blanket seal on the core tube (Figure 3.10-1). Low blanket
pressure enhances the feasibility for it. One could also design a
catcher for limited blanket leakage as part of the blanket reproces-—

sing stream. Then, no seal at all might even work.

Reactor Vessel.
3.10.3 Filling, Draining and Dump Systems

Two tanks below the reactor vessel serve for filling and drain-
ing. Each can contain the whole salt inventory of core or blanket.

They provide for quick dumping of the core and/or blanket or for

accumulating salt leaks from the reactor vessel. Two more tanks
function as standbys and as delay tanks for salt removal for pro-
cessing, one each for core and blanket. An emergency cooling
system would remove the decay heat from any tank through the same
lines used for preheating.

Mechanical pumps or gas pressure can transfer the salt. For
initial filling the fuel or tlanket salt will be brought to site
in solid form. Electric immersion heaters or steam coils that
pass below the surface of a salt bath melt the salt under inert
gas in small non-critical batches. Heating a solid bath of salt
from the bottom alone can develop sufficient pressure to rupture
equipment or expel the molten salt through the solid surface.

Once molten. the salt can be pumped .into the reactor,

The primary salt circuits will require preheating to about
600°C ; the secondary, less. In some areas it will be more economic
and convenient to heat whole spaces such as the reactor vault and
processing plant; trace heating is better for longer lengths of pipe-
work as in secondary ripes to the steam generators. Submerged
centrifugal pumps circulate the salt. They are of a type
which permits no contact of the salt with the packing gland, The

ORNL MSRE encountered no particular problems with preheating.

368
The MSR uniquely separates, concentrates, and stores part of its wastes
within the plant for neutron economy, safety, and corrosion protection
of the reactor. Being already in the form of a concentrated heat
source suggests the possibility of dissipating the decay heat by put«
ting it to work, One use could be for preheating. Felium or a low-
melting point salt like Flibe (363°C) could be the heating agent. An
auxiliary heater would provide a backup heat source, especially prior

to accumulating sufficient fission product waste,

3,105 Overall Plant Size

Building laycut in the 3ritish MCFR(Pu) design is compact: the
reactor vessel and primary circuit are small; the plant requires no
elaborate fuel handling machinery. The skewed-tube configuration and
tube replacement machinery here forfeit some of this compactness.
If inline pyrochemical reprocessing proves practical and economical,
it should fit in the building with little size increase. This in-
cludes the attendant control and maintenance areas. If feasible,

high pressure storage of fission gases would also save much space.

369
 

3.11 Economics

Several earlier sections have mentioned potential economic

advantages with MSRs, and MCFRs in particular. This section

attempts to summarize these and others; many come from an in-

ternally-published British study for an MCFR(Pu) [29]..

3.11.1 British Study Results

3.11.1.1 Capital costs. Here they found

The MSFR avoids elaborate control systems and complex fuel
handling equipment. This implies cost savings through
compactness and simplicity. However necessary auxiliary
systems increase costs.

Component smallness allows shop fabrication in nearly all
cases.

The simplicity of a chemical type of plant should

a. Ease erection, testing, and commissioning procedures

be. Reduce construction time with consequent savings in

interest and overhead charges.

If full advantage could be taken of the higher temperature

potential , further savings on plant costs could accrue
with the lead secondary=-coolant/steam plant system.
Should secondary cooling by helium prove feasible (satisfy
safety requirements), the associated temperatures possible

with it might permit use of gas~turbines« Significant

370
savings might then accrue from skipping a tertiary cir—
cuit and using a layout integrated in a pre-stressed con-

crete pressure container vessel,

3.11.1.2 Fuel cycle costs. The British study assumed

71] Off-site solvent extraction of heavy metals

2. Removal of residual fission products

3. Cn-line removal of volatile fission products and salt

clean-up.

Le. A reprocessing cycle of three months cooling-off delay

period and three months processing and transport time.

5. A one-month stockzile of fresh fuel at the reactor site.
Comparison of fabrication ard reprocessing costs showed a definite
advantage for an MCFR over the oxlde~fuelled LMFBR, as expected.

If the maximum fuel salt temperatures can increase from the
800°C of the reference lead-cooled case to 920°C, the MCFR (Pu)
inventory could reduce by 25%. It would then approach that for
the oxide-fuelled IMFBR; the doubling time also would then fall
to a value .Similar to that of the LMFBR.

The British also examined the on-line pyrochemical process in
the hope that it would reduce inventory over the aqueous process.
While it appeared technically feasible, the initial cost estimates
were discouragingly high. These stemmed from

1. Batch processing of small "non-critical quantities,

2. The remote operation and maintenance involved.

This area needs further study.

im
 

3.11.1.3 Summary. MCFRs appear to offer better economics than
LMFBRs. The fuel cycle costs above assume the well-established
aqueous processing for heavy metal; :an on-line high-temperature
process only cleans the salt up. Potentially large capital savings
in a high temperature MCFR warrant further study of its plant

design, maintenance problems, and safety.

3.11.2 Transvortation Costs

Transportation of conventional spent reactor fuel incurs large
eosts through

1. The high radioactivity of the fuel

2. The considerable residuzl heat

3. The presence of fissionable materials.
These necessitate

1. Extensive shielding materials

2. Small packages or package cooling

3. Cumbersome handling procedures

L. Security (safeguards)

5. Special accident procedures during transport.
The transportation problem largely determines the consuwruction sites
for reprocessing plants and the cooling time of the spent fuel before
reprocessing Fra4le An MSFR with in-plant reprocessing avoids all of

this except for BG transport.

372
 

3.11.3 Outage Penalties

An MCFR may experience less downtime than a conventional LWR:
MCFR core tubes should wear out more frequently, but low activity
and the fewness of number should simplify the task. However, problems

related to peripheral equipment malfuncti.... still apply, and could be

greater with a new concept.

3.11.4 Other Costs

Graphite tubes should be cheap. NaCl will be dirt cheap. To,
abounds in nature more than W,. An MCFR avoids fuel element fab-

rication and enrichment costs. High flow velocities incur high pump—

ing costs.

373
 

Le0 SUMMARY

4.1 Pu, Proliferation, Safeguards, Security, and Waste Management

Much concern with the nuclear fuel cycle centers on Pu due
to its carcinogenicity and its potential use in a weapon. One
desires close control less it pollute the environment or be di-
verted (overtly or covertly) to weapons use. Once chemically sep-
arated (relatively easy to do for Pu) it can be put into a pre=~
assembled bomb within days. The main difficulty will be to pro-
perly implode the device. National or large subnational groups
might be able to practice that trick beforehand.

Present and prospective solid fuel cycles involve extensive
fuel logistics including elzment fabrication, decladding, and post-
operation storage. Molten salt reactors skip these steps, thereby
reducing much of the pollution and diversion dangers.

A reactor an the Th fuel cycle minimizes production of Pu and
heavy actinides by beginning much lower on the atomic weight scale
and usefully consuming them. Fast reactors succeed even better by
enhancing fission, especially for 23hy, This pertains especially
to fast molten salt reactors with a very hard neutron spectrum.

All reactors use or produce weapons-grade fissile fuel. In
the Th fuel cycle, the predominantly-<>-U fissile fuel discloses
its presence by emitting a hazardous, characteristic highly-
penetrating gamma ray. Any transformation of the reactor to the
U/Pu fuel cycle will evidence a reduced gamma signal.

An K3R also allows one to cantinuously remove the principal

(gaseous) radiation hazard from the fuel and store it away from

374
 

the reactor. This fact plus the ability to transfer the whole
core further underground at a moment's notice should enhance

security of the plant from attack.
L.2 Reactor Design

Extensive evaluation of core salt properties favors cheap

NaCl as the carrier salt, ThCl, for fertile material, and UCL

3
for fissile material. High fissile salt proportion (Th/U = 0.5,
30% NaCl) will yield high BG (up to O.4) and enhance actinide
fission due to hard neutron spectrum. However, it also causes
high doubling time and more frequent replacement of radiation-
damaged core tubes.

Doubling time reduces to near 20 years at lower fissile con-
tents (Th/U = 1 to 2, 30% NaCl). The optimum composition should
lie in between these two points, depending on the assignment of
priorities. In earlier years of operation one might operate with
a low fissile content to achieve low DT, low. flux levels, and
softer spectrum. Then in later years, when more is known about

radiation damage and the press for available 233

U is diminished,
the plant could switch to a salt of higher fissile content so as
to avoid actinide buildup and produce more surplus neutrons(high=
er BG).

The blanket region could benefit from a thermalizing carrier
salt like "Lica or a Iluoride instead of NaCl, but cost and high
melting points, respectively, discourage those.

The optimum core configuration for BG and DT appears to be

a few frequently-replaced, skewed, graphite tubes in a blanket

315
 

bath 2 meters thick: a cost-effective solution to the high flux
levels inherent to this concept, Inner blanket regions definitely
detract: they decrease BG without decreasing the out~of-core in-
ventory.

Le3 Technical and Economic Feasibility

Fast molten chloride reactors have been cursorily considered
before but mainly for the U/Pu fuel cycle. The ORNL MSR program
showed the feasibility of fuel salt circulation. The combination
of that experience and MCFR research (out-of-pile experiments and
theoretical studies, so far) provide a basis for believing the
concept will work.

Chemical stability and corrosion of molten salts are fairly
predictable, Low vapor pressure of the salts enhances safety and
permits low pressure structural components.

Molten fuel state and cooling out-of-core simplify component
design in a radiation environment. They forego complicated
refueling mechanism, close tolerances associated with solid fuel,
and mechanical control devices. Molten state and low vapor
pressure of the salts also offer inherent safety advantages.

Graphite and Mo alloys and coatings appear as promising
candidates for primary salt containment, both in and out of core.
These high temperature materials may permit high fuel salt
temperatures (above 1000°C). This can reduce fuel salt inventory
in the heat exchanger and allow gas turbine cycles and/or process

heat applications using helium as an intermediate and final coolant.

376
 

Use of the MCFR on the Th fuel cycle should greatly expand the
amount of available fuel: three times as much Th exists as U.
The high BG accompanying very fast neutron spectra in some MCFR
designs will enhance the economic retrievability of extensive

low-grade U and Th ores.
