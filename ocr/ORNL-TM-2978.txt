ABSTRACT

Corrosion by NaBF,-NaF mixtures (4—8 mole 9 NaF) low in
oxygen and water was studied with 6800-hr static tests at
605°C in standard Hastelloy N capsules with titanium-modified
Hastelloy N specimens. Boron trifluoride gas was added to
overpressures up to 400 psig. Specimens in the molten salts
and at the interface showed both weight gains and losses. The
gains decreased with increasing NaBF, content, and losses up
to 0.03 mg / cm? (< 0.01 mil/year) were observed for specimens
in 4 mole ¢ NaF. Weight changes of specimens in vapor were
very small and independent of overpressure. The main reaction
was the oxidation of chromium in the alloy by iron fluoride in
the salt to form Na,;CrF, and deposit iron on both specimens
and capsule. Metallographic examination showed only minor
attack and no difference in the two Hastelloy N alloys.

The rate of chromium depletion at 605°C was consistent
with the rate of solid-state diffusion of chromium to the
alloy surface. Additional tests from 538 to 760°C showed
Arrhenius behavior that confirmed this mechanism,

Fluoroborate salt mixtures were found compatible with
Hastelloy N alloys under the conditions of these experiments,
and comparison with other experiments showed that increases
in water and oxygen content increased the chromium uptake
and corrosion.

 

INTRODUCTION

The successful use of molten fluoride salts in a reactor system, as

demonstrated by the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) at the Oak

Ridge National Laboratory, has led to development studies for a Molten

Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR). One of the most promising features of

molten salts has been the low corrosion rates experienced with materials

of construction, principally nickel-base alloys.

INow with AEC Division of Space Nuclear Systems, Washington, D.C.
Theory and experiment? have shown that the corrosion resistance of
metals to molten fluoride salts varies directly with the "nobility" of
the metal; that is, the resistance to attack varies inversely with the
magnitude of the free energy of formation of the fluorides of metals in
the container material, Therefore, the container alloy for the fluoride
salt must have only a small percentage of constituents that are easily
oxidized by the components of the salt. Considering these facts and
utilizing information gained in corrosion testing of commercial alloys,
ORNL developed’ a high-strength nickel-base alloy, Hastelloy N, containing
17% Mo, 7% Cr, and 5% Fe, for use in the MSRE. These early experiments,
as well as many recent corrosion tests*™ © in LiF-BeF,-Th¥,, LiF-BeF,-UF,,
and LiF-BeF,-UF,~ThF,, have shown that Hastelloy N is very resistant to
attack and corrosion rates are below 0.1 mil/year.

Recently the selection of a fluoride salt that can be used as a
coolant to transfer heat from the fuel salt to a steam power conversion
system has been seriously considered. Cost and melting point considera-
tions favor the sodium fluoroborate mixture, NaBF,—8 mole ¢ NaF. However,
little information exists on corrosion by fluoroborates. Initial corro-
sion results were obtained from an impure fluoroborate salt (high in
oxygen and water) in thermal convection loop tests,’ but these results
were not considered indicative of behavior with purer salt. Since that
time, new methods of preparation have greatly increased the purity of

available salt with respect to oxygen and water.

The overall objective of this study was to determine the corrosion
characteristics of pure (low oxygen and water) NaBF,-NaF mixtures under
isothermal conditions. Of particular concern was the temperature-
dependent dissociation of the salt into liquid NaF and BF; gas. Thus,
we first determined the effects of varying the concentration of our salt
mixture and the BF; pressure over it in 6800-hr tests at 605°C. In a
later series of experiments we determined the rate of chromium uptake

by NaBF,—8 mole ¢ NaF between 538 and 760°C in 1200-hr tests.

EXPERIMENTAL METHOD AND MATERIALS

The capsule design used in studying the effect of salt composition
and BF; overpressure (Series I) is pictured in Fig. 1. Each capsule con-
tained three specimens of titanium-modified Hastelloy N, one located in
the vapor space, one in the salt, and one at the liquid-vapor interface.
The capsule was constructed of commercial Hastelloy N and was 2 in. in
diameter x 6 in. high. The titanium-modified alloy is considered

because of its superior radiation-resistant properties.

The capsule used in studying the effect of temperature (Series II)
was basically the same. However, the test specimens were commercial
Hastelloy N in the form of 0.030-in.-thick strips to provide more surface
area. Each capsule was 2 in. in diameter X 8.5 in. high and contained
16 specimens. The capsule is pictured in Fig. 2, and the test specimens
are shown in Fig. 3. Table 1 lists the compositions of the alloys used

The salt for these tests was processed by the Fluoride Frocessing
Group of the Reactor Chemistry Division. The very pure (> 99.99) starting
materials were evacuated to about 380 torr, heated to 150°C in a vessel
lined with nickel, and then held for about 15 hr under these conditions.
After the rise in vapor pressure was observed to be not excessive (indi-
cating no volatile impurities), the salt was heated to 500°C while still
under vacuum and agitated by bubbling helium through the capsule for a
few hours. The salt was then transferred to the fill vessel and forced
into the capsules with helium pressure. Salt chemistry is discussed
under "Results" in this report.

All capsules were heated in vertical muffle furnaces (Fig. 4) and
monitored with Chromel-P vs Alumel thermocouples, which had been spot
welded to the capsule and covered with shim stock. In our first series
of tests all capsules were operated at 605°C, close to the maximum tem-
perature proposed for the coolant salt in the MSBR. Capsule 1 of this
series contained a helium overpressure of 4 psig and no added BFs.
Capsules 2, 3, and 4 contained BF; corresponding to overpressures of 50,
100, and 400 psig, respectively. Initially the added BF; dissolved in
the molten salt or combined with the NaF, but after a few minutes the
pressure in the capsule gradually increased. However, when the capsules
had been pressurized to the operating pressures, no changes in BF; con-
tent were necessary during the test. The compositions of the salts

calculated from amounts of BF; added are shown in Table 2.

After 6800 hr the salt in each capsule was removed and sampled. The
capsules were opened and the specimens were removed, washed in warm dis-
tilled water, dried with ethyl alcohol, and weighed. The specimens and
capsules were examined metallographically and by x-ray fluorescence and
microprobe analysis. The salts were analyzed before and after the tests.

In our second series of experiments, the capsules were operated at
427°C (800°F), 538°C (1000°F), 649°C (1200°F), and 760°C (1400°F) with
5 psig He overpressure and calculated equilibrium BF; pressures of 0.005,
0.07, 0.5, and 2,5 psia, respectively. After 1200 hr the salt in each
capsule was removed and sampled for analysis. The salt had also been

analyzed before test.
RESULTS

Effect of Salt Composition and BF, Pressure (Series I)

Weight Changes

The compositional changes in the salt effected by BF; gas additions
in our first series of tests caused a measurable difference in the weight
"changes of our test specimens. As shown in Table 2, the welght changes
were relatively small, and some specimens showed weight gains instead of
the expected losses. There was no correlation between the pressure of

BF, and the weight change of the specimens exposed to the vapor.
 

The specimens immersed in salt in capsules 1, 2, and 3 showed pro-
gressively decreasing weight gains. The salt specimen -in capsule 4 showed
a weight loss equivalent to a corrosion rate less than 0.01 mil/year.

The same weight change pattern was observed for the specimens at the
. interface. Thus, the weight gain of specimens in the liquid and at the
interface increased as the amount of NaBF, in the salt decreased.

Figure 5 shows the specimens after test. Very little corrosion was
noted at any position on the specimens or capsules.

no change was noted; only the test specimens contained titanium, and
they constituted only a small part of the total system. The only change
in the water and oxygen concentrations occurred in capsule 4. The high
oxygen concentration reported for this capsule would normally have pro-
duced highly oxidizing conditions® and high corrosion rates. The
reported value is believed to be in error because close examination of
the system disclosed no leaks or signs of oxidation. Apparently some
BF3; escaped from the capsules after cooling and during opening, since
the concentrations of sodium, boron, and fluorine in the salt were about
the same in the final analysis of each capsule.

where (s) indicates solid solution in Hastelloy N and (d) indicates
dissolved in salt. Any water or oxygen-type impurity in the salt would
also have caused some oxidation of the container materials, but these
impurities appear to have been negligible in this series of tests.
Because the salt in these experiments contained NaF, the chromium fluo-
ride in the corrosion product was found as NasCrFg. This material has
also been identified in other corrosion experiments” and its crystal
structure has been determined by x-ray diffraction analysis. © Also,
the iron fluoride in these experiments may have existed as NasFeFg, but

this compound was not identified.

Specimen Chemistry

The proposed corrosion reaction was verified further by x-ray
fluorescence analysis of the specimens. Table 4 gives the composition
of the near-surface region of a specimen from capsule 4. The composi-
tion was determined by comparing x-ray intensities with those of a
specimen not exposed to salt or vapor. For any given region in the
capsule, the qualitative results from all the specimens were quite
similar. These results show a depletion of chromium and enrichment of
iron in the near-surface region. All specimens also showed a loss of
titanium. Microprobe analysis showed essentially the same surface
changes. A chromium gradient was seen but was so small that we could
not distinguish between edge effects and an actual gradient.

However, no borides were identified either on our specimens or in the
salt, and the experimental evidence that iron replaced the chromium
indicates that reaction (1) rather than (2) was the predominant mode of
chromium oxidation. If essentially no iron fluoride compound were
present in the melt, reaction (2) could well control the corrosion

process.

Metallography

Figure 6 shows the microstructure of the specimen from the vapor
region of capsule 1. There was some indication of a very thin, discon-
tinuous deposit at the surface in the as-polished condition. After
etching, this deposit was no longer visible. Figure 7 shows the speci-
men that was exposed to salt in capsule 1. A deposit is visible on the
as-polished specimen. Etching again removed the deposit but in this
case produced considerable attack at the exposed surface. Metallographic
observation of the capsule wall showed similar behavior. This deposit is
apparently iron rich, and the area revealed by the etchant is chromium-
depleted Hastelloy N. Thus, no difference in the behavior of titanium-
modified and standard Hastelloy N was noted in this test. The interface
between the salt and gas could be seen on the capsule, but no attack was

noted there.

Effect of Temperature (Series II)

Our second series of tests was designed to determine the effects of
temperature on chromium mass transfer from the Hastelloy N to the salt.

oh

The salt was analyzed before and after test to determine impurity pickup.
The NaBF;,—8 mole % NaF contained approximately 400 ppm each of oxygen end
water before and after test. - The chromium concentration in the salt
. increased while the iron decreased, as seen in Table 5. No changes in
the concentration of nickel and molybdenum were noted. Again, the
results suggest chromium oxidation by reduction of an iron fluoride
compound. Metallography of Hastelloy N from this test showed, after
stehing, no attack of the specimen (Pig. 8).

INTERPRETATION OF CORROSION RATES

If the chromium surface concentration remains constant (only true
if the salt contains an excess of iron) at any given point in the cap-
sule, the amount of chromium leaving a capsule in Series I is given by

the equationl?

MW = 20(Co — c,) /Dt /x , (4)

where
MW = integral flux of Cr leaving metal, g/cm?
o = density of metal, g/cm’
Co = initial weight fraction of Cr
C., = surface weight fraction of Cr
D = diffusion coefficient of Cr in alloy, cm?/sec
t = exposure time, sec.
Using the following information
Salt in capsule = 282 g
Cr increase in salt = 55 ppm (by weight)
Capsule surface area = 142 cm?

to obtain AW and then using

Co = 7.5%
c,=0 (consistent with excess of Fe)
o = 8.8 g/cm’?
t = 6800 hr,
we obtain
Dogleg = 33 X 10"1° cm? /sec at 605°C.

This compares favorably with 3 x 101° cm?/sec at 605°C extrapolated

from the range 700 to 850°C from datal?® of DeVan and Evans for chromium

diffusion in Hastelloy N. From this comparison, we conclude that the
controlling rate mechanism in this experiment was the solid-state dif-
fusion of chromium in the alloy and that the oxidation potential of the
salt was established by the presence of iron fluoride.

ature for the experiments of Series II. Included for comparison are

hold between 538 and 760°C. This would be expected if the rate of
chromium buildup in the salt were controlled by solid-state diffusion
of chromium to the capsule wall. Using diffusion data for chromium in
Hastelloy N obtained by DeVan and Evans!’ and assuming the chromium
surface concentration to have been reduced to zero by the salt, we
predict a chromium buildup shown by the dashed line in Fig. 9. The
agreement between the slopes (activation energy) of the predicted and
experimental curves, although not exact, gives credence to the assump-
tion that chromium mass transfer to the salt is limited by solid-state

diffusion of chromium to the Hastelloy N surface.

CONCLUSIONS

1. Titanium-modified Hastelloy N specimens were exposed for
6800 hr to isothermal NaBF,-NaF salt mixtures containing only a few
hundred parts per million oxygen and water and varying in composition
from 4 to 8 mole % NaF. Specimens in the vapor region lost weight in
all but the 96 mole ¢ NaBF, mixture. Specimens fully immersed in the
salt gained weight in all but the 96 mole % NaBFs mixture. The weight
gains decreased as the NaBF, content of the salt increased.

2. No differences in the corrosion of specimens in the vapor
region were noted as a function of BF; overpressure to 400 psig.

3. In the main corrosion reaction, chromium from the alloy was
oxidized by iron fluoride impurities initially in the salt. The iron
that was reduced deposited on the specimens and capsule.

4. Metallographic observation of both standard Hastelloy N capsules
and titanium-modified Hastelloy N specimens showed very little attack,
although a thin discontinuous deposit rich in iron was observed at the
surface of specimens exposed to vapor.

5. A diffusion coefficient for chromium in Hastelloy N calculated
from the rate of chromium removal from standard Hastelloy N by
NaBF,~8 mole % NaF held between 538 and 760°C agreed well with an
extrapolation of published results. Thus, solid-state diffusion of
chromium appeared to be the rate-controlling mechanism for corrosion

in these tests.
-

6. Under the condition of these experiments, the fluoroborate
salt mixtures were compatible with the Hastelloy N alloys. By virtue
of other experiments we conclude that increases in water as impurity

increase the chromium uptake and the corrosion.
