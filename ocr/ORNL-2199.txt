INVESTIGATION OF FLUID FLOW IN THE ART AND OTHER
REFLECTOR-MODERATED REACTOR CORES

SUMMARY

The turbulent flow of liquid through ART reflector-moderated reactor
cores of annular cross section has been studied because of the need to ob-
tain a steady flow exclusive of the normal unsteadiness of turbulent flow
in ducts. This steadiness is important because when a large amount of heat
(100,000,000 Btu/hr-£t3) 1s being generated in the volume of liquid by nu-
clear fission at high temperatures (1200°F - 1600°F), low-frequency temper-
ature fluctuations due to unsteady, irregular flow of the liquid can result
in hot spots, thermal cycling, and fatigue of the containing materials.

To facilitate the experimental work, studies were made of water flow-
ing through quarter-scale transparent plastic models of the cores so that
flow visualization techniques could be used in the work.

An extensive series of tests of many core systems were made over a
range of Reynolds moduli based on core midplane dimensions and axial flow
rate up to ~,90,000. The corresponding Reynolds modulus for the "21-inch"
ART core was ~. 95,000, using the properties of fluoride mixture No. 30 at
1425°F. Also, analyses were made .of velocity and static pressure data ob-
tained on a full-size "21-inch" ART core model with several different en-
trance conditions by Whitman, Stelzman, and Furgerson of ARED.

The following conclusions were reached as a result of this series of

experiments:

(a) Axial flow through the cores with sufficiently large cross-sectional
area expansion rates ccnsidered here will always be accompanied by a
separation of the forward flow from a point on the outer wall near
the inlet and violently unsteady reverse flow in the "separated" re-
gion. This separation at the outer wall is due to the large adverse
pressure gradient resulting from the large area expansion rate, the
lower fluid shear stress at the outer wall than at the inner wall
(common to flow through annular ducts), and the curvature of the
channel. The flow into the entrance of the core models was always
uniform radially and circumferentially, having passed through a calm-
ing length of 40 diameters of straight pipe into an annular "nozzle"
which was mounted on the core entrance.

(b) Rotational, or spiral, flow through the same cores is always accom-
penied by separation of the forward flow from a point on the inner
wall near the inlet and unsteady reverse flow in the separated re-
gion with a velocity component in the direction of the rotation.

The separation in this case is caused by the same adverse pressure
gradient and the lower fluid shear stress at the inner wall relative
tc the outer wall (a phenomenon of flow in curved channels). Again,
the flow at the core entrance was uniform radially and circumferen-
tially, having passed through 40 diameters of straight pipe into an
annuler "nozzle" which preceded the turning-vane section which pro-
duced the rotational flow.

(c) In rotational flow, the turbulent interchange of momentum and the eddy

aap.
¥

 
conductivity are diminished at the inner wall due to the centrifugal
force field set up by the fluid motion; and, therefore, increased tem-
peratures due to volume heat generation can be expected at the inner
wall over the temperatures obtained in straight flow at the same rate
in an equivalent channel.

(4d) If the spiral velocities are very high, frictional forces become of
such magnitude that a decay of the spiral velocities becomes notice-
able and a backflow due to spiral vortex decay will begin. This was
noticed in the high spiral velocity case studied by Whitman, Stelzmsn,
and Furgerson. Backflow occurred on the inner wall at the exit plane.

(e) Turbulence promotion within the cores has been shown to overcome the
effects of adverse pressure gradients, but the promoters must be such
that they do not introduce unsteady flow; i.e., the scale of the pro-
moted turbulence must be very small. Woven-wire screens and perforated-
plate screens of low solidity and small wire diameter (or web thickness)
packed into the divergent part of the core flow channels are of such
nature. Turbulence promoters such as vortex generators or large ob-
structions placed in the core entrance cause unsteady flow although
they seem to eliminate the separation and the assoclated backflows.

(f) Straight annular cores and cores of sufficiently low expansion rates
can be constructed to give a steady, unseparated flow with axial flow.
Calculations show that the maximum midplane-to-inlet area ratio that
can be achieved with axial flow through a bare core is 1.33:1 within

an 18-in. length of a 21-in.-0.D. core with the same midplane area

as the "21-inch" ART core.

Calculations have shown that a pressure unbalance (L 1b/in.%) due to
momentum transfer exists in the header which is of the same order as

the friction losses in the core. This pressure discrepancy is in the
form of a rise in pressure as the fluid traverses the length of the
header from the inlet duct. The unbalance, plus any unsteadiness trans-
mitted to the flow by the fuel pumps, will also create peripheral flow
asymmetries and unsteady core flow.

The calculations also point up two considerations. One is that
the header pressure unbalances are primarily due to the average fluid
velocity level in the headers considered. Thus, header fluid veloc-
ities should be kept as low as practicable. The core pressure loss
should also be as large as practical to keep the relative importance
of the header unbalances small.

Since screen packing in the core has been shown tc eliminate the un-
steady flow, which is an inherent characteristic of the core shape, it
is proposed that this system be used in the core. An additional advan-
tage accrues from the use of the screens in an increase in core pres-
sure loss and the related velocity profile flattening. The peripheral
asymmetry due to pressure unbalances in the header will then be much
less than exists without the screens. It is felt that perforated-plate
screens with the same relative pressure loss and mesh size as the wire
screens tested would be more advantageous from the structural and fab-

rication standpoint than the wire screens.

The heat-transfer characteristics of the screens are in the proc-
ess of being investigated to determine whether any problems exist in
this regard.

(i) A header system has been designed which may afford smaller pressure un-
balances than the present header system and, being used in conjunction
with the screen-packed core, may allow single-pump operation without
large peripheral flow asymmetries, Further experimental work is in
process to establish the validity of this conclusion and conclusions (g)

and (h).

INTRODUCTION

Statement of Problem

 

The design of circulating-fuel nuclear reactor systems which must operate
at high power densities (~-100,000,000 Btu/hr-rt3) and at temperatures near to
the limits of endurance of their containers (1200°F - 1600°F) places special
emphasis on the detailed knowledge of the behavior of the circulating-fuel tem-
peratures with respect to position and time.

According to analyses on forced-convection heat transfer with volume heat
sources within the liquid, b’ 23 the temperature distribution depends upon the
velocity distribution, the heat-generation rate, the heat-removal rate at the
wall, and the molecular and turbulent heat transport properties of the liquid.
If the velocities and turbulent heat-transfer properties are unstable with time
and asymmetric with respect to the channel center and core circumference, then
fluctuating temperature distributions and hot spots will occur due to the asym-
metrical heat removal from the core. The magnitude of the temperature oscilla-
tions and hot spots may or may not exceed the endurance limits of the containing
materials.

The problem took two parts: the first, to find some way of obtaining sta-
ble and peripherally symmetrical flow in the ART cores proposed by A. P. Fraas
and W. T. Furgerson of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Aircraft Reactor Engi-
neering Division; and second, to investigate other designs for reflector-
moderated reactor cores in an effort to find some configurations which would
not have unstable flow.

Development of Project and Statement of Purpose

In 1952, R. E. e121" observed the flow of air through a configuration

called the "Fireball" reactor core which had an annular cross section prepen-
dicular to the flow. The center-to-inlet (or exit) area ratio was 5.4:1 while
the total length of the varying cross section was 24.6 in. A section parallel
to the core axis is seen in Figure 1.

Ball found that the forward flow separated from the outer shell at approx-
imately 5.3 in. from the inlet and that the separation increased in severity
with distance along the flow path. By filling in the region of separation using
plasticene, Ball was able to provide a flow contour which reduced the amount of
reverse flow. Since the velocities, as measured with a pitot tube, were still
low near the walls, vanes were added in the inlet which, after some experimen-
tation, produced a fairly flat velocity distribution. However, no observations
were made to determine fluctuations in the velocity with time.

Ball states that some pecularities in forming the Plexiglas outer shell of
the core resulted in a greater rate of divergence than anticipated. However,
since the originally designed rate of divergence was so much greater than the
limiting maximum value of 8 deg included angle for a conical diffuser in which
no separation takes place, separation would have occurred even without the vari-
ations introduced in fabrication. Filling in the flow passage reduced the rate
of divergence of the channel.

“Evidently, Ball's results were deemed inconclusive either because of the
inaccuracies in fabricating the Plexiglas core shells or because of the reduced
core diameter resulting from the "filling in", since another investigation was

Bradfute studied the flow of water through a quarter-scale model of a
core with an equatorial outer diameter of 18 in. This core was assembled
using stainless steel for the inner shell and Plexiglas for the outer shell,
both shells being carefully machined to the correct contours. The shape of
this "18-inch" core differed from that studied by Ball and is shown in
Figure 2. The full-scale core had a midplane-to-inlet area ratio of 3.8:1
and an over-all length of 36 in, The reduction in the area expansion ratio
was effected by increasing the outer shell diameter at the inlet from 8 in.
to 10 in. This change, coupled with an increase in core length, resulted in
a reduction in the channel divergence angle.

It was later foundS© that the "18-inch" core required a larger UF, con-
centration (6.5 to 9 mole %) than was originally calculated (~.4 mole %). The
new calculations showed that a 21-in.-dia core would be required to obtain the
4 mole % concentration. The core shape was proposed by W. T. Furgerson. This
design had a midplane-to-inlet area ratio of 4.36:1 in the same length as the
"18-inch" core. This core is shown in Figure 3. Early in 1955 work was in-
itiated on a 10/44-scale model of this "21-inch" core.

Parallel to this investigation, full-size "21-inch" core mock-up studies
were carried out by G. D. Whitman, W. J. Stelzman, and W. T. Furgerson using
the header and pump system designed by Furgerson et al.

Studies of circulating-fuel reactor core hydrodynamics have also been
made at Pratt and Whitney Aircraft in conjunction with their reactor research
program, 33H Mention of these studies is made so that a complete reference

to all published reports known to the authors on this subject is at hand.

Due to the lack of an adequate analytical technique for establishing
velocity distributions in geometries as complex as those of the ART cores, re-
course was made to the experimental sclution of the problem. The techniques
described were developed to provide a means for rapid qualitative examination
of the velocity distributions in the test core geometries.

Since it was felt that the phenomena of separation, backflow, and large-
scale unsteady flow observed in the "18-inch" and "21-inch" cores were un-
desirable for a high-temperature, high-power-density core, much emphasis was
placed on the effort to find reflector-moderated reactor core systems which
possessed steady flow.

Most of the velocity distributions shown were sketched from visual obser-
vations of the deformation of a glowing band of excited phosphor particles as
they moved with the water through the core models. Measurements of the veloc-
ity distributions for the case of axial flow through the "18-inch™ ART core
model were made by the stroboscopic photography of tobacco seeds suspended in
the flowing water.

Analyses of the data obtained by the group studying flow in the full-
size model of the "21-inch" core with several different entrance systems are

also presented.

EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS

Flow System

The experimental flow system consisted of a recirculating loop contain-
ing fluid reservoirs, a centrifugal pump, flow and temperature measurement
and control devices, and a test section containing the core models and associ-
ated entrance and exit regions. A schematic drawing of the system is shown
in Figure 4. Further details regarding the system components are presented
in Appendix B.

Water was used as the working fluid. Both stroboscopic particle photo-
graphy and phosphorescent particle visualization techniques were used to
establish the local velocities and flow characteristics of the core regions.
These methods are discussed in greater detail in Appendix A. The over-all
friction losses in the cores were determined using a 30-in., U-tube mercury-
manometer. Inlet and exit fluid temperatures were measured with mercury-
glass thermometers. The core models and entrance systems studied are de-

scribed in the following paragraphs.

The Core Models

The core models studied are tabulated below:

a. A 1/4-Scale Model of the "18-inch" ART Core. The outer shell was
machined from a solid Plexiglas piece and the island was machined from stain-
less steel. Figure 5 shows a cross-sectional view of this test section with
a table of typical dimensions. The dimensions of the inner and outer walls

of the full-size core are obtained from the cylinders of revolution described

method was employed to seal the test section as in case d. Figure 9 shows a

Core Entrance Systems

A calming length of 40 diameters of straight pipe followed by a convergent
"nozzle" transition piece preceded the core model entrance as shown in Figure 11.
This insured an axial flow which was uniform both radislly and circumferentially
at the core inlet. Other inlets to the core were also used; a turning-vane sec-
tion could be added at the core inlet to produce rotational flow in the core
(Figure 12), a twin tangential inlet similar to the present ART header system

was also used (Figure 13), and vortex generators were added at the core inlet

(Figure 1k).

MATHEMATICAL ANALYSES

Mean Velocities and Reynolds Numbers in "21-inch" ART Core

Mean axial and rotational components of velocity were obtained for three
entrance conditions for the "21-inch" ART core from velocity data tsken in the
full-size ART core model. ® The entrance conditions were: (1) a high velogity
rotational flow induced by two 2.1 by 2.1-in. tangential entrance ducts directed
perpendicular to the core axis, (2) a lower velocity rotational flow induced by
two similarly arranged 4.38 by 3.45-in. ducts, and (3) a still lower velocity
rotational flow induced by adding turning vanes to the second case.

Axial components were obtained by dividing the volume flow rate by the
core cross-sectional areas. Dividing the volume flow rate by the entrance
duct areas for the first two cases gave the mean rotational component at the
entrance. By assuming conservation of angular momentum, the mean rotational
components were computed as a function of axial length. For the third case
(turning vanes), the rotational component was obtained from velocity data
measured at the core midplane. This data was first adjusted to account for
the property differences between fuel No. 30 and water; and then, using angu-
lar momentum conservation, the radial component was calculated as a function
of axial position. The velocities obtained from these analyses are plotted as
a function of axial length in Figure 15.

The velocity results were combined with the core dimensions and the phys-

ical properties of fuel No. 30 at 1425°F (Teble 1) to obtain the resultant

vector Reynolds moduli.

Pressure Distributions in ART Core

To find the pressure losses in the ART core for the first two cases men-

were no similar data for case 1, it was assumed that the turning losses were
proportional to the square of the velocity coming from the entrence ducts.

Figure 19 presents the resulting core geometry as constructed graph-

rounded off to give a smooth transition to the symmetrical exit half. The re-

area ratio is 1.33:1. Without rounding-off at the midplane, the ratio would
be 1.41:1. In comparison, the "18-inch" and "21-inch" ART cores have area
ratios of 3.80:1 and 4.36:1, respectively, for the same length as the 1.33:1

area ratio core.

Pressure Distribution in ART Heads

Pressure unbalances in entrance regions such as the ART core inlet head
are caused by friction losses and momentum changes. For the systems under
study, friction losses were found to be small as compared to the pressure

changes due to momentum transfer. The pressure variations due to momentum

change in the fluid is accompanied by a pressure change. The second is the
momentum transfer that occurs as the fluid leaves the header and turns into

transfer is less than perfect, a 100% effectiveness was assumed for simplic-

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Axial Flow Through Cores

(c)

The qualitative velocity distributions for axial flow through a quarter-
scale model of the "18-inch" ART core™® are shown in Figure 22 along a
vertical section through the flow channel for a midplane Reynolds modulus
of 3,000. These distributions represent the visuel impressions of veloc-
ity profiles obtained using the phosphorescent particle flow visualization
technique described in Appendix A. Although there were some differences
of opinion among three independent observers regarding a few details such
as the exact shape of the profiles, there was unanimous agreement concern-

ing the gross features of the flow.

Velocity measurements obtained’ by the stroboscopic photography of par-
ticles suspended in the water flowing through the "18-inch" core model
at a higher flow rate (Np = 10,000) verified the qualitative observa-
tions made earlier. Figure 23 shows these profiles. The stroboscopic

particle photography technique is described in Appendix A,

The qualitative velocity distributions in a 10/Ll-scale model of the
"21-inch" ART core’ are shown in Figure 24. These profiles were ob-
tained visually as in case (a) for a midplane Noe = 2,800. In addition,

Qualitatively observed axial velocity components of the rotational flow
through the "18-inch” core modell are shown in Figure 28. The rota-

signed to give a velocity of constant scalar magnitude at an angle of
5 deg from a horizontal plane at the core inlet.

Rotational flow wes also observed in the 10/4k-scale "21-inch" core
15

model. The qualitative axial velocity component distributions are

shown in Figure 29. Approximate flow angles obtained with the phospho-
rescent particle technique are also given. The inlet turning vanes
(designed by a. F. Wislicenus), which add the rotational component, were
shaped such that the trailing edges of the vanes gave a greater rotational

component at the channel center than near the walls. The average core in-

let flow angle was approximately 45 deg. Figure 30 shows a photograph

Flow Through 10/44-Scale ART "21-inch" Core - Twin Tangential Entrance
Header - One-Pump Operation

The gross flow features of a 10/4l-scale "21-inch" ART core with twin
tangential entrance ducts (scaled from the ART medium rotational velocity
entrance) were obtained by observing the motion of phosphorescent particles
in the water while simulating single-pump operation. The flow features near
the inner and outer walls are indicated in Figure 31. Arrows indicate the

main direction of the flow near the walls.

Flow Through Cores with Turbulence Promotion

(a) Axial flow through the "18-inch" ART core model with twelve 1l6-mesh
screens spaced one inch apart in the inlet pipe was studieat® using the
phosphorescent particle flow visualization technique. Figure 32 shows
the arrangement of the screens and the core used in this study. Qual-
itatively sketched velocity profiles are shown in Figure 33 along a

vertical section of the flow channel.
(b) The "18-inch" quarter-scale core model was equipped with eight aerofoil-
type turbulence promoter vanes attached to the outer wall at the inlet.’
Figure 34 shows the vanes attached to the outer shell, and the three
vertical planes where visual observations were made. The island has
been removed to provide a clear view of the vanes. Qualitative velocity
profiles in the three planes mentioned are shown in Figure 35 at

Figures 43 through 47 show the flow features and velocity profiles
obtained with these screen arrangements using the phosphorescent particle
technique. The total relative pressure loss for the five combinations is
shown in Figure 48 as a function of core midplane Reynolds modulus. It
was found that the combination given by number 5 of Table 4 prevented
boundary layer separation and created a fairly uniform velocity field.
This is shown in Figure 47.

The inlet area expansion of a 10/4l-scale model of a "21-inch" straight
annular core was also packed with combinations of screens. 20 A sketch of
the flow channel with the screen positions indicated is shown in Figure 49
and a photograph of the core packing in Figure 50. Two combinations were
tried: 0.385 solidity ratio screens in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6; and
0.385 solidity ratio screens in all six positions. Figures 51 and 52 show
the flow features of these combinations. Plotted in Figure 53 is the rel-
ative pressure loss for the second packing combination as a function of
core midplane Reynolds modulus. The second packing combination prevented
boundary layer separation in the abruptly diverging entrance region and
gave a fairly uniform flow throughout the core. The boundary-layer sep-
aration region shown in Figure 52 near the exit of the core results from

the too abrupt turning angle in this region.

DISCUSSION

Literature Surve

The dynamics of fluid flow through the ART and other proposed reflector-
moderated reactor cores is complicated by the shape of the cores and their
small length-to-hydraulic dismeter ratio. A horizontal section through any
of these core flow passages presented a ring-shaped, or annular, aspect. The
area of this ammulus was described as some function of the axial distance from
the inlet. Usually this area first increased and then decreased as the dis-
tance from the inlet increased. A further complication was added when the
flow was introduced such that it proceeded in a spiral fashion through the
core. The length-to-diasmeter ratio of the cores was between 6 and 10. For
spiral flows, the length of flow path to diameter ratio varied between 10 and
50, depending on the ratio of the spiral to axial velocity components.

Although the whole flow problem is enormously complicated by these fac~
tors, the problem can be clarified somewhat by considering a series of simpler
problems. Disregarding the short L/D of the core and considering only axial
flow, the hydrodynamic field can be described as primarily turbulent flow in

a divergent-convergent annular duct.

Since the body forces are balanced out by a corresponding pressure force,
equation (24) can be written

Thus, if the cross-sectional area increases in the direction of flow,
there is a corresponding pressure rise in the direction of flow.

The assumption of frictionless flow leads to the conclusion that the veloc-
ity distribution in a plane perpendicular toc the flow is uniform at any plane;
and, in diffusers, the diminution of velocity with distance from the inlet of
the diffuser is uniform, These assumptions give a finite discontinuity at the
walls. The walls do not move; and, at the wall, the velocity is that of the

main stream. However, fluids are not frictionless; and the equations presented

€.

 
do not give the whole picture of flow through divergent channels.

An interchange of momentum exists in all fluids that eliminates the dis-
continuity at the walls so that the fluid velocity at the wall is zero, and
the curve of velocity versus distance from the wall rises in a continuous
fashion to the main stream velocity. This interchange of momentum gives rise
to a "shear" force between the various layers of fluid which is expressed in
the differential equation

_dp, dn _ pay

ax * dy = &; dx

where dp is the pressure difference across the differentiel fluid element,

ax
between x and x + Ax as Ax —> 0; ¥ is the difference in shear stress across
the element between y and y + Ay as oy —> 0, and = & is the change of mo-~

c
mentum of the fluid in the element between x and x + AX as Ax —> 0.

The shear force T, in laminar flow, is proportionel to the velocity

gradient perpendicular to the flow direction; i.e.

TEHE .
In turbulent flow, however, the shear stress is not proportional to the

velocity gradient; i.e.,

T = Xz viu!

Prandtl assumed that v'! and u'! are correlated to be of the same order of

dv

magnitude, thus both are proportional to 1 . ay 3 and obtained

where € has the dimensions of a viscosity coefficient, but is not constant.
It depends on the turbulence intensity (v' and u'), indirectly.

It can be seen, in general, that if the adverse pressure gradient (pres-
sure rise in flow direction caused by the area increase) is greater than the
shear gradient, the fluid element loses momentum. Since the fluid near the
wall is retarded by friction, it has much less momentum than does the rest of
the stream. The adverse pressure gradient (being uniform across the channel),
if sufficiently large, can cause the velocity near the wall to taken on nega-
tive values. Thus the forward flowing stream, in effect, separates from the
surface.

It is also noted that if the velocity distribution is made "flat" such
that large velocity gradients occur near the walls, the shear stress gradients
at the walls will be larger; and the fluid can force its way against a larger
adverse pressure gradient without separation. In flows in places other than
in entrance regions, where the velocity is uniform to begin with, the "bound-
ary layers"; i.e., layers of fluid moving more slowly than the main stream due
to the action of the stationary walls through the viscosity (laminar or tur-
bulent) of the fluid, have grown in thickness such that the flow is substan-
tially nonuniform. Here, the velocity distribution can be msde more uniform
by mechanically increasing the turbulence level somewhat uniformly across the
channel; thus increasing €, which tends to equalize velocities in adjacent
layers of fluid in the channel.

Experiments have been carried out in smooth, two-dimensional channels of
rectangular cross section with varying angles of divergence between the two

opposite walls which form the long sides of the rectangular cross section.’

The flow into the channels was essentially uniform. The velocity distributions
obtained by Nikuradse in this study for established flow through channels of
various divergence angles (negative angles refer to channels converging in the
direction of flow) are shown in Figure 59. No backflow regions exist at either
wall in Figure 59-a; separaticn of the forward flow is just beginning tc take
place at 10 degress in Figure 59-b; at 12 degrees in Figure 59-c, separation

is more evident; and in Figure 59-d at 16 degrees, there is a tendency %o
switch from wall to wall, each configuration being maintained for some time.

At still larger angles, the separation takes place at both walls. In Fig-

ure 59-a, it is also seen that as the divergence angle increases from O to 4
degrees the velocity tends to peak more sharply in the center of the channel;
conversely, as the wall angle decreases from O degrees (converging channeis),
the flow profile is flattened out.

The maximum value of the area gradient obtained before separation of the
forward flow took place was found to correspond to an included engle between
the divergent walls of 8 to 9 degrees. Similar experiments done with “dif-
fusers" of circular cross section also have roughly established the maximum
included conical angle to be 8 to 10 degrees. In comparison, the included
angle of a conical diffuser roughly equivalent to the divergent half cf the
"21-inch" ART core is ~30 degrees. From this, it is evident that separation
cf the forward flow from the walls of the core will occur by virtue of the
core geometry alone.

That this separation of the forward flow from the walls is due to the

adverse pressure gradient rather than tc any other property is demonstrated

by an experiment conducted on flow through a pipe of rectangular cross section
constructed such that the width of two opposite sides increased while the width
of the other two sides decreased, the area remaining constant along the pipe.
When fluid flows through such a pipe, there is no separation of flow from the
walls,

The "2l-inch" ART core also decreases in cross-sectional area from the
midplane to the exit at the same rate as the area increases in the upper half
such that the core is symmetrical about the "equator" or midplane. If separa-
tion of the flow takes place in the upper half of the core, it becomes impos-
sible to describe quantitatively the flow distribution in the lower half of
the core without resorting to experimental measurements. Therefore, no con-

clusions can be drawn from convergent channel data as to the flow distribu-

tion in the convergent half of the core.

Flow in Curved Channels. The effects of spiral flow through ART and other

 

reflector-moderated reactor cores can be seen by studying the simpler case of
flow in a curved channel. When curved flow is obtained, body forces due to
the change in flow direction play a role in the turbulent mixing. Thus, to
balance the centrifugal force, a pressure distribution is set up across the
flow which decreases the turbulent momentum exchange near the convex inner
wall and augments the momentum exchange near the concave outer wall.
Experiments have been conducted by Wattendorf™s on the turbulent flow of
air in a two-dimensional curved channel. The velocity distributions for fully-
developed flow in curved channels of outer radius to width ratio of 5:1 and
10:1 are compared to fully-developed turbulent straight channel flow in Fig-

ure 60. It is seen that the differences between straight flow and curved flow

become more pronounced as the ratio of chamnel radius of curvature to channel
width is decreased.

The eddy diffusivity distribution for the 5:1 curved channel is compared
with that of a straight channel in Figure 61. Two values for the eddy diffus-

ivity can be obtained because of the difficulty in deciding whether

which arises from Prandtl's reasoning based on the exchange of angular momentum,

or

c= (30)

 

vhich is the generalization of the equation for laminar flow where

Toc (I - Y)
p dr r
is the valid equation.

Shear stress measurements by Wattendorfo- give diffusivities lying between
those given by the above expressions, being much closer to equation (30) than
to equation (29). It is seen from Figure 61 that the eddy diffusivities are
less than the straight channel diffusivities near the inner convex wall and
greater, near the outer wall.

As the ratio of radius of curvature to channel width increases, the cen-
trifugal forces decrease for a given flow rate. Thus for ratios above 5:1, the

‘eddy diffusivities will fall somewhere between the straight-channel and the

 
-— -98- SE

5:1 curved-channel values. Since the curvature parameter is ~-2:1, on the
average, for rotational flow in the "21-inch" ART core, the differences be-
tween straight and curved flow will be even more pronounced than shown by

Figure 61,

Flow Through Screens. Investigations by Baines and Peterson®’ of flow

 

through screens show that the relative pressure loss through a screen is
largely a function of the screen form (single and biplane lattices, round bars,
perforated plates, woven-wire, etc.) and solidity ratio (the ratio of the ob-
structed area to the total area of the screen). Below a Reynolds modulus of
1,000 based on the wire diameter of the screen, the pressure loss is also a
weak function of Reynolds modulus, increasing slightly as Reynolds modulus
decreases. Figure 62 shows the relative pressure loss as a function of screen
form and solidity ratio for Nee, sc > 1,000.

Low solidity ratio screens tend to flatten any arbitrary velocity dis-
tribution, while screens above a solidity ratio of ~~0.5 may magnify or create
velocity profile asymmetries since small differences in hole sizes can cause
very large differences in the pressure drops through various parts of the
screen. Figure 63 shows the effects of screens of different solidity ratios
on an arbitrary velocity profile.

The intensity of turbulence at distances greater than 10 wire diameters
downstream from the screen is a function of wire size and distance from the
screen. Therefore, a large diameter wire will create a larger velocity fluc-
tuation (i.e., intensity of turbulence) at a given point downstream from the
screen than a small wire. The fluctuation frequency will also be lower for

ghe larger wire,

Screens in Diffusers. The equalization of velocity distribution and the tur-

 

bulence promotion effects of screens have been shown to prevent separation or

25

to restore unseparated flow in a diffuser. Screens prevent separation by a
combination of a number of factors: (1) increasing the velocity gradient at
the wall, (2) increasing the turbulent mixing and, consequently, the shear
stresses near the wall downstream from the screen, and (3) reducing the ad-
verse pressure gradient along the wall. In studies by Schubauer and Spangen-

25 wide-angle diffusers were "filled" by a number of screens spaced along

burg,
their length. In general, the number of screens required to "fill" the dif-
fuser increased as their solidity ratios decreased. Figure 64 demonstrates

the effect of a single woven-wire screen in a conical 30-deg included angle

diffuser.

Discussion of Results

Axial Flow Through ART Core Models. It was seen from the results of the ex-
periments on the quarter-scale "18-inch" ART core model and the 10/LL-scale
"21-inch" ART core model with a radially and peripherally uniform axial in-
let flow that axial flow was always accompanied by boundary-layer separation
and reverse flow in the separation region. The separation region began at a
plane 0.7 in. below the inlet plane of the "18-inch" model and covered the
outer wall to a plane approximately three-fourths of the core length from the
inlet. The separation region in the "21-inch" model was approximately the
same size, beginning about 0.5 in. below the inlet plane.

It should be emphasized that the reverse flow in the separation region
is violently unsteady, being composed of large vortex-like eddies and flow
stagnations which were intermittently created and destroyed. These instabil-
ities, in turn, created unsteadiness in the main part of the flow adjacent to
the separation region. Because of the short length-to-diameter ratio of the
cores (~10), this unsteadiness was carried practically undiminished out the
exit of the core by the flow. The boundary-layer separation observed results
from the large adverse pressure gradient (pressure rise in the direction of
flow) caused by the velocity decrease as the fluid moves into the core. In
turn, the velocity decrease is caused by the increase in the flow area through
the inlet half of the core.

The comparatively lower fluld shear stress near the outer wall than the
inner wall (common to flow through annular ducts) and the curvature of the

channel away from the axis at the entrance probably caused the preferential

 
uu -104- goon

separation from the outer wall.

Axial Flow in Two Constant-Gap Core Models. The investigation of axial flow
through two constant-gap core models of midplane-to-inlet area ratios of
1.443:1 and 2.133:1 revealed that boundary-layer separation occurred at the
outer wall in both cases. For the 1.443:1 area ratio core, the separation
region was very thin and the point of separation moved toward the inlet as

the flow Reynolds modulus increased. At a core midplane Reynolds modulus of
20,000, the separation alternately occurred at the inner and outer walls;
while at 30,000, separation occurred only at the outer wall. With the 2.133:1
area ratio core, the separation layer was thicker on the outer wall and began
at a point closer to the inlet than in the previous core. Very little depend-
ence of the separation point on the flow rate was noted.

These results verified the previous prediction that boundary-layer sep-
aration would occur in axial flow through cores of midplane-to-inlet area
ratios greater than 1.41:1. If the 1.443:1 core had been constructed so that
its rate of area increase was similar to the 1.41:1 area ratio core, instead
of being zero at the inlet and midplane and reaching a maximum value half-way

between, separation might have been avoided.

Rotational Flow Through ART Cores. It was found from the quarter-scale
"18-inch" core model and 10/4k-scale "21-inch" core model tests and from data
obtained with the full-scale ART core model tests? that rotational flow was
always accompanied by boundary-layer separation and violently unstable re-
verse flow in the separation region. The separation region in all cases be-

gan at the inlet on the inner wall and extended approximately three-fourths

of the core length from the inlet.

 
— ri- Po

The separation here was also caused by the same adverse pressure gradient
as before. The preferential separation from the inner wall was probably caused
by the comparatively lower fluid shear stress near the inner wall than near the

outer well (a phenomenon of flow in curved channels).

One-Pump Operation - ART Inlet Header. The same gross flow features described
in the previous section were observed in one-pump simulated operation of the
ART inlet header-"2l-inch" 10/4k-scale core model combination. In addition,
a region of violent eddying was observed at the inner wall directly under the
jet of fluid issuing from the tangential entrance. Peripheral flow asymmetries
in the entrance half of the core were noted. The observations of the position
of the eddying agreed roughly with the position of a large temperature ssymme-
try measured in the core volume-heat-source experiment run under the same con-
ditions.=!
In this study, the positions of the tangential inlets are reversed from

those in the ART. However, this only results in a reversal of the flow struc-

ture without affecting any of the flow details.

Flow Through Cores with Turbulence Promotion. Three methods of turbulence pro-

 

motion were tried in the "18-inch" and "21-inch" ART core models. This approach
to the problem of improving the core flows was suggested by the elementary con-
siderations presented previously. If the amount of turbulent momentum inter-
change in the flow can be increased between the low velocity boundary layers

and the high velocity fluid in the midstream, separation could be eliminated.

In terms of fluid shear stress, this would mean that the turbulent shear stress
gradient near the wall would be increased and thus, the forces on a fluid ele-

ment near the wall would tend to move the element forward with the flow.

It was found in the experiments that the scale of the promoted turbulence
(a definition of the average size of the eddies) was also important. For ex-
ample, twelve 16-mesh woven-wire screens placed in the entrance pipe of the
"18-inch" core model (Figures 32 and 33) added sufficient turbulence to the
flow to move the point of separation farther downstream from the core inlet
than when no screens were present. A striking calming effect was also noted.
In axial flow through the "18-inch" core model without screens, the flow in
the separation region was very unsteady; while with the screens, the reverse
flow was much more steady and streamline in character.

When turning vanes were added to give a rotational component to the flow,
no differences were noticed either in the velocity profiles or in the general
character of the flow for the cases of screens located before the turning
vanes and no screens. It should be pointed out that the turning vanes add
turbulence of a larger scale to the flow.

Contrasted with this was the flow obtained using vortex generators of the
aerofoil type attached to the outer wall at the inlet (see Figures 34 through
38). Though the separation region on the outer wall was not eliminated in
these cases, peripheral flow asymmetries and variable horizontal velocities
of low frequency were noted in the separation region. Since these flow fea~
tures had not been observed in axial flow through the "18-inch" core model,
they were probably the result of the large-scale vortices generated by the
aerofoils.

The flow obtained in the "18-inch" and "21-inch" core models with several
vortex generators (see Figures 14 and 39 through 41) of various turning-vane

angle settings was also variable in nature, the "21-inch" core exhibiting flow

IR _—

 
any -107- gud

variability to a much greater degree than the "18-inch" core model. Eddying
and periods of flow stagnation were visible at intervals in both cores.

It is seen from these experiments that the induced turbulence must be of
a small scale (corresponding to a high-frequency spectrum of velocity fluctua-
tions) and of high intensity (large ratio of fluctuating velocity component to
the mean velocity). If the scale of the turbulence is large enough, the fre-
quencies of the velocity fluctuations are low enough to be called variable
flow. Since turbulent flow is unstable flow, the question arises as to where
one draws the line between turbulent flow and variable flow. In connection
with high-power, high-temperature circulating-fuel reactors such as the ART,
the answer is provided by the restriction that the turbulent eddies must be of
a small enough scale to insure that the associated wall-temperature fluctua-
tions are of sufficiently high frequency and small magnitude to be considered
negligible. This is the safest assumption to make, since the effect of low-
frequency thermal cycling on the wall material is not yet fully understood.

For turbulent flow through a parallel-plates systemd where the wall-
temperature fluctuations are negligible from the low frequency, large magni-
tude thermal cycling standpoint, the ratio of the characteristic scale of
turbulence (perpendicular to the flow) to the channel width is of the order
of 0.1, while the ratio of the scale of turbulence (perpendicular to the flow)
to the wire diameter of a turbulence-producing screen” is of the order of 1,
on the average. Therefore, in the ART model core channel of average width
~ 0.8 in. with screens of wire diameter ~0.02 in. (for the 16-mesh screens),
the scale of turbulence produced by the screens is about one-fourth of the

scale of turbulence in the flow through a parallel-plates system of equal

Lo Ae
& iH :

 
channel width. The ratio of the root-mean-square lateral velocity fluctua-
tions to the mean velocity of the flow is also much larger behind a screen
(0.2 - 0.5 maximum) than the corresponding values for turbulent flow in a
channel (0.03 - 0.04 maximum).

The magnitude of random turbulent velocity fluctuations established a
short distance behind a screen decay at a rate predicted by Frenkiel's decay
law:

¢ Xs 8
= 1.12 I for ¥ 2 .

<ie

Since the scale of the turbulence is proportional to the screen wire diameter,
it is seen that small-scale turbulence decays more quickly than large-scale
turbulence.

From these considerations, it is evident that if the scale of the pro-
moted turbulence is smdgll - as it must be to prevent large temperature ex-
cursions - the turbulence dies out quickly behind the turbulence promoting
device. This was indicated clearly by the striking calming effect of the
screens placed in the inlet pipe on the flow through the "18-inch" core model.

Evidence of the effect of promoted turbulence of a large scale on the
temperature structure wes seen in the ART core volume-heat-source experiment?!
with a half-scale model of the guide vane and baffle plate arrangement shown

23 While the boundary-layer separation regions at the core walls

in Figure 65.
were eliminsted by the action of the baffle plate on the flow, wakes consist-
ing of vortices shed from the edges of the baffle plate and the trailing edges

of the vanes created a low-frequency variable flow in the core.

 
 

Figures 66 through 683° 111ustrate the type of flow occurring in wakes
and separation regions. Figure 66 is a photograph of flow in a separation
region (in this case, behind a stalled aerofoil), Figure 67 shows the wake
behind a cylinder (representative of a screen wire), and Figure 68 pictures

the flow around a flat plate held perpendicular to the stream.

Flow Through Cores Packed with Screens. Due to the high rate of turbulence

 

decay in the flow downstream from a screen and the unsteadiness induced in
the flow by large-scale turbulence promoters, it became apparent that turbu-
lence promotion at the entrance plane of the core would not be satisfactory
from the standpoints of flow separation elimination and flow stabilization.
The placement of screens in the core seemed to be the logical answer to the
decay of the promoted turbulence.

The work of Schubauer and Spangenburg>’

noted earlier showed that when
screens of low-solidity ratio (< 0.5) are placed across a wide-angle diffuser,
not only was turbulence promoted by the screens; but the velocity distribution
across the flow channel was made more uniform near the screen. If a sufficient
number of screens were placed across the diffuser at different locations along
the axis, boundary-layer separation was completely eliminated and the flow was
made more steady.

The velocity redistribution effects which resulted from the screens placed
across the diffuser can be explained by first considering a plane jet impinging
against a solid wall perpendicular to the jet axis. As the well is approached,
the streamlines of the jet bend away from the axis and finslly become parallel

to the wall, the streamlines describing a family of hyperbolic curves,

Centrifugal pressure gradients accompanying the curving flow create a pres-
sure distribution which increases toward the jet axis and toward the wall.
According to Bernoulli's law of energy conservation, the fluid velocities
decrease as the pressure increases. If the wall is porous, some of the fluid
passes through the wall while the rest is turned as before. The extent to
which the fluid is turned decreases with increasing porosity; or, in terms of
the solidity ratio (the opposite of porosity), the stream passes through the
wall with more and more of its original concentration as the solidity ratio
decreases.

Thus, a screen placed across a diffuser forces the high kinetic energy
fluid away from the axis of the stream, where it tends to concentrate, toward
the walls; and a flattening of the velocity profile occurs in the vicinity of
the screen. The degree of flattening depends on the relative pressure loss
of the screen, which is a function of the solidity ratio, and the form of the
screen (squere bars, round bars, single or biplane lattices, woven-wire screens,
perforated plates, etc.). The more uniform velocity distribution plus the tur-
bulence generated by the screen help to move the fluid near the wall behind the
screen in the direction of flow, thus preventing separation of the flow.

The "filling" effect of a screen in a diffuser evidently exists only in
the vicinity of the screen, the extent of the vicinity depending upon the rate
of expansion of the diffuser (large rate of expansion corresponds to a small
extent of the vicinity) and the relative pressure loss (large pressure loss
corresponding to large extent of influence).

It was found that five screens arranged as given by combination No. 5 of

Table } prevented separation and gave a fairly uniform flow in the ART core.

§
ay
-—_— a1e- vo

In the inlet area expansion of the straight annular core, six 0.385 solidity
ratio screens gave a fairly uniform flow. It is seen that approximately the
same number and type of screens were packed into the wide-angle divergence of
the straight core as were spread over the upper half of the ART core to pre-
vent separation. This beers out the considerations presented above. In
addition, when a 0.510 solidity ratio screen replaced the farthest downstream
0.385 solidity ratio screen (combination No. 4 of Table 4), the resulting
velocity distribution following the screen was more uniform. (See Figure 47.)
This is again in accord with the above discussion.

In the straight core, the boundary-layer separation region seen in
Figures 51 and 52 is a result of the abrupt curvature of the channel near
the exit. The pressure must rise along the outer wall and fall along the
inner wall as the curve is approached so that a radial pressure gradient is
obtained to balance the centrifugsl force generated by the curving flow. The
adverse pressure gradient, or pressure rise in the direction of flow, along
the outer wall was apparently too large; and boundary-layer separation was
the result.

If the separation can be eliminated by increasing the radius of curvature
of the flow path, or by eliminating entirely the flow area contraction at the
exit, this core model may possess a number of advantages over the present ART
core with screens. These are as follows:

(a) The screens, being in a lower neutron flux region, would
absorb fewer neutrons, thus having less effect on the re-

actor criticality.
E— 13 vow

(b) The screens are concentrated in the coolest part of the
reactor, easing the problem of screen corrosion.
(c) The volume of the core is larger (3.89 £43 compared to
3.23 t3) reducing somewhat the average power density.
(d) The fuel channel width is smaller (a maximum of 4 in.
compared to 5-1/8 in.), causing a reduction in the channel
wall-to-centerline power density ratio due to reduced self-
shielding.
The last two considerations would reduce the uncooled wall to mixed-mean tem-
perature differences in the fuel. A problem may exist in adequately cooling
the screen packing under zero fuel flow conditions and at times when the fuel
is dumped from the reactor. Investigations are indicated to specifically
ascertain the extent of this problem.

A perforated-plate type of screen would have the same effect as the
woven-wire screens on the flow through the cores, if its relative pressure
drop and web thickness were the same as the relative pressure drop and wire
diameter of a woven-wire screen. The solidity ratio of this "equivalent"
perforated plate can be found by referring to Figure 62, find the pressure
drop associated with a woven-wire screen of a particular solidity ratio on
Curve IV; and then, using that pressure drop, obtain the perforated-plate
solidity ratio from Curve I. For structural and fabrication reasons, the
perforated-plate type of screen may be more desirable than the woven-wire

screens used in the experiments.

Velocity Fluctuation Studies. The fluctuation "frequencies" were obtained

. 3 LJ

 

 
an A14- i

from the movies taken in the dye filament studies=t with the full-scale model

of the ART core. The analysis was accomplished by counting the number of
times the angular deflection curve crossed the average angle curve and divid-
ing by the elapsed time (about 1.5 sec). It will be noticed that the fluc-
tuations have no obserable periodicity; they are completely random. No con-
clusions could be drawn from the magnitude of the fluctuations, since the
distance of the dye filament from the wall was not exactly known; even though
the angle measurements were made at the point of injection and the dye fila-
ment was known to be close to the wall at that point. The components of the
velocity fluctuations influencing the dye filament were also unknown.
However, the frequencies were taken to be the frequency of changes of
conditions at the walls, and the fundamental mode of the frequencies was in
general agreement with the fundsmental mode of the temperature fluctuations

a7

in the volume-heat-source experiments after allowance for the difference in
average velocities.

It is felt that, given the same conditions, the fluctuation frequencies
are proportional to the flow rate. This was qualitatively ascertained by com-

paring movies of dye filament fluctuations for two different flow rates in the

same core.

Average Fluid Velocities in the Full-Scale "21-inch" ART Core. It is observed

 

in Figure 56 that the data are in fair agreement with the predicted average
velocities except for the high-velocity rotational flow case. Here, the rota-
tional velocities fall below the prediction. Since the axial average velocity

components were in fair agreement with predicted values and since the exit

 
a -115- ©. 1

rotational velocity profiles at two peripheral stations 90 deg apart prac-
tically coincided, it was concluded that the high frictional drag had created
a noticeable "vortex decay", or slowing down of the rotation, as the fluid
passed through the core. Frictional effects were not considered in the pre-
diction. This was further substantiated by the increasing difference between
the predicted and experimental values as the core exit is approached.

A backflow occurred near the exit on the inner wall in the high-velocity
flow which also indicated the vortex decay, the backflow being induced by the
adverse pressure gradient created by the decaying rotational component of
velocity.

It was observed that a large discrepancy existed between the predicted
and experimental values for the average rotational flow component in the en-
trance half of the core for the high- and medium-velocity swirl cases. This
was noticed because the angular momentum of the flow in this region increased
as the equator was approached, which is impossible without an external force
acting upon the fluid.

The conclusion was reached that the data are erroneous in the upper helf
of the core for these two cases. This conclusion is further supported by the
fact that due to separation of the flow, a large amount of cross-flow exists
in the upper half of the core. This would cause errors in the data which were
obtained by impact "claw" probes. Since the probes could not be rotated to
face the cross-flow, they would tend to read low; and since the impact tube
and "yaw" tube arrangement wes not calibrated in cross-flow, an erroneous

value for the flow angle could also result.

 
Further support for this conclusion comes from the vaned-flow case in

Figure 56. Here, separation and the accompanying cross-flow were probably

eliminated, and the flow was primarily in the plane of rotation of the "claw
probe. It is seen that no such discrepancy exists in the rotational component
and that the trend of what little data there is follows the predicted rotation-

al flow curve.

Pressure Distributions in the "21-inch" ART Core. The vortex decay in the
high-velocity rotational flow also explained the difference between the pre-
dicted and actual pressure differential between the inner and outer walls for
that case. The prediction was based on the predicted velocity distribution.
In the case of the medium-velocity rotational flow, however, the prediction of
average velocities agreed well with the data; so that the prediction of the
pressure distribution on the inner wall using the outer wall pressure data and
the calculated difference is probably sound.

The pressure distributions shown in Figure 58 for the three cases (high-
and medium-velocity rotational flow, and axial flow) showed that the total pres-
sure loss was large for the first case (about 45 psi) and relatively small for
the other two cases (about 7 psi). In the case of the axial-flow system, most
of the pressure loss was caused by improperly designed turning vanes and a per-

forated plate placed at the core entrance.

Pressure Distributions in ART Heads. Since the pressure loss through the core

 

is small, additional disturbances can be caused by pressure unbalances in the
core entrance header, For example, the pressure loss was 2 1b/in.? at a

1200 gpm fuel flow rate for the screen-packed core shown in combination No. 5

*
v

 
 

of Table 4 and less than 2 psi without screens (see Figure 58).

The calculations showed that the header shown in Figure 20(c) gave the
smallest pressure unbalance, though even this unbalance was half the core pres-
sure loss with screen packing. In an open core, these unbalances would cause
a considerable amount of peripheral flow, adding to the unsteadiness already
present, Since the velocity distribution in the exit half was evidently nearly
uniform with periphery (see Figure 56), the cross-flow probably took place in
the inlet half of the core. The actual existence of such cross-flow was masked
by the low accuracy of the data in that region and the violently eddying sepa-
ration region. With the large pressure differences found, the assumption of
uniform fluid withdrawal from the header is no longer a good one; and the asym-
metrical withdrawal of fluid will serve to lower the pressure rise somewhat.

The calculations do point up two considerations, however. One is that
the header pressure unbalances, for the configurations presented, are primarily
due to the average velocity level in the header. Therefore, header fluid veloc-
ities should be as low as practical. This is afforded by the header in Fig-
ure 20(c). The core pressure loss should be as large as practical to keep the
relative importance of the header pressure unbalences small. This was effected
by the screen packing scheme, which also eliminates separation and destroys the

thermal boundary layers in the core.

CONCLUSIONS

The following conclusions were reached as a result of this series of
experiments:

(a) Axial flow through the cores with sufficiently large cross-sectional
area expansion rates considered here will always be accompanied by a
separation of the forward flow from a point on the outer wall near
the inlet and violently unsteady reverse flow in the "separated" re-
gion. This separation at the outer wall is due to the large adverse
pressure gradient resulting from the large area expansion rate, the
lower fluid shear stress at the outer wall than at the inner wall
{common to flow through annular ducts), and the curvature of the
channel. The flow into the entrance of the core models was always
uniform radially and circumferentially, having passed through a calm-
ing length of 4O diameters of straight pipe into an annular "nozzle"
which was mounted on the core entrance.

(b) Rotational, or spiral, flow through the seme cores is always accom-
panied by separation of the forward flow from a point on the inner
wall near the inlet and unsteady reverse flow in the separated re-
gion with a velocity component in the direction of the rotation.

The separation in this case is caused by the same adverse pressure

gradient and the lower fluid shear stress at the inner wall relative
to the outer wall (a phenomenon of flow in curved channels). Again,
the flow at the core entrance was uniform radially and circumferen-

ly having passed through 40 diameters of straight pipe intc an

 
-— oT yor

(e)

annular "nozzle" which preceded the turning-vane section which pro-
duced the rotational flow.

In rotational flow, the turbulent interchange of momentum and the eddy
conductivity are diminished at the inner wall due to the centrifugal
force field set up by the fluid motion; and, therefore, increased tem~
peratures due to volume heat generation can be expected at the inner
wall over the temperatures obtained in straight flow at the same rate
in an equivalent channel.

If the spiral velocities are very high, frictional forces become of
such magnitude that a decay of the spiral velocities becomes notice-
able and a backflow due to spiral vortex decay will begin. This was
noticed in the high spiral velocity case studied by Whitman, Stelzman,
and Furgerson. Backflow occurred on the inner wall at the exit plane.
Turbulence promotion within the cores has beer shown to overcome the
effects of adverse pressure gradients, but the promoters must be such
that they do not introduce unsteady flow; i.e., the scale of the pro-
moted turbulence must be very small. Woven-wire screens and perforated-
plate screens of low solidity and small wire diameter (or web thickness)
packed into the divergent part of the core flow channels are of such
nature. Turbulence promoters such as vortex generators or large cb-
structions placed in the core entrance cause unsteady flow although

they seem toc eliminate the separation and the asscciated backflows.

(f) Straight annular cores and cores of sufficiently low expansion rates
can be constructed to give a steady, unseparated flow with axial flow.
Cageulations show that the maximum midplane-to-inlet area ratio that

cue

 
_—_ ~120- AB

can be achieved with axial flow through a bare core is 1.33:1 within
an 18-in. length of a 21-in.-0D core with the same midplane area as
the "21-inch" ART core.

(g) Calculations have shown that a pressure unbalance (4 1b/in.%) due to
momentum transfer exists in the header which is of the same order as
the friction losses in the core. This pressure discrepancy is in the
form of a rise in pressure as the fluid traverses the length of the
header from the inlet duct. The unbalance, plus any unsteadiness trans-
mitted to the flow by the fuel pumps, will also create peripheral flow
asymmetries and unsteady core flow.

The calculations also point up two considerations. One is that
the header pressure unbalences are primarily due to the average fluid
velocity level in the headers considered. Thus, header fluid veloc-
ities should be kept as low as practicable. The core pressure loss
should also be as large as practical to keep the relative importance
of the header unbalances small.

(nh) Since screen packing in the core has been shown to eliminate the un-
steady flow, which is an inherent characteristic of the core shape, it
is proposed that this system be used in the core. An additional advan-
tage accrues from the use of the screens in an increase in core pres-
sure loss and the related velocity profile flattening. The peripheral
asymmetry due to pressure unbalances in the header will then be much
less than exists without the screens. It is felt that perforated-plate

screens with the same relative pressure loss and mesh size as the wire

 
’ -121- .f

screens tested would be more advantageous from the structural and
fabrication standpoint than the wire screens.

The heat-transfer characteristics of the screens are in the proc-
ess of being investigated to determine whether any problems exist in
this regard.

(i) A header system has been designed which may afford smaller pressure un-
balances than the present header system and, being used in conjunction
with the screen-packed core, may allow single-pump operation without
large peripheral flow asymmetries. Further experimental work is in
process to establish the validity of this conclusion and conclusions (g)

and (h).

VELOCITY MEASUREMENT AND FLOW VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUE

Stroboscopic Particle Photography

The measurement of velocities in the transparent "18-inch" ART core model
was done by stroboscopic photography of the light scattered from a collimated
plane of light parallel to the flow direction by tobacco-seed particles sus-
pended in the water flowing through the core. tt

The distance between two images of the same particle divided by the meas-
ured time between the flashes of light which produced the images gave the aver-
age velocity of the particle between the two positions. The particle velocity
was very nearly the velocity of the water, since the density of the tobacco-
seed particles was close to that of water, and the particle size was small.

Since the curved surfaces of the "18-inch" ART core model cause an appre-
ciable apparent distortion of the relative positions within the core model, a
1/16-in. thick Plexiglas sheet scribed with co-ordinate lines was first placed
inside so that it lay within the plane of the light beam.

This grid was supported by a second island which was split along its
centerline and fitted with short pins to position a two-piece grid. The other
half of the island was cut to fit the first with the grid halves in place.

The plastic sheet was then edge-lit from two edges in a darkened room,
the lines scattering light from the interior of the plastic and identifying
their position; photographed by a 4 x 5-in. Grover monorail camera equipped

with a Kodak Ektar f4.7 lens facing at approximately right angles to the plane

 
ay -123~

of the light beam; and removed. The resulting photograph is shown in Fig-
ure 69.

The camera was unmoved until after the particle photographs were taken
so that the two negatives could be superimposed and the actusl co-ordinates
of the particles determined by reference to the similarly distorted grid
system.

The flash-light sources were General Electric FT-220 electronic flash-
tubes operated by three 35-uf condensers in parallel and charged to about
2,360 v. A continuous light source was used so that the two images of each
particle would be connected by a track, for identification on the film. This
light was a General Electric H1000-B19, 1000-w mercury arc light. The light
from all the sources was collimated by a pair of slits; the one farthest from
the sources being common to all three sources, the sources being arranged to
be in the same vertical plane.

Figure 70 is a photograph of the test section with the split island and
grid in place, the camera in the foreground, and the collimator with the mer-
cury vapor light operating. The side plate of the collimator has been removed
to reveal the three slits in addition to the common one. One of the flash-
tubes is in the cylindrical housing seen behind the upper collimator slit.

The flashtubes were flashed and the time interval was measured by an
electronic instrument consisting of an audio oscillator whose output frequency
was manuglly controlled. A signal was sent from the oscillator to a conven-
tional scaler whose output was one voltage pulse for 64 input pulses. The

output of the scaler was further scaled down by two more stages in a special

 
LS

"trigger unit." This unit then amplified and delivered the pulse to the first
flashtube power supply which flashed its light. The second pulse, received 256
cycles from the audio oscillator later, fired the second flashtube. The cycle
was not repeated until the trigger unit was reset.

When the flashtubes flashed, another signal was sent to a Hewlett-Packard
Electronic Counter which was set so that the first pulse started it and the
second pulse stopped it. The time between pulses was displayed on the counter
front.

Figure 71 shows a photograph of the electronic instrument.

Kodak Tri-X Panchromatic and Royal Pan film were used in the camera for
the recording of the light scettered by the tobacco seeds. Developing was
done with Eastman DK-19a developer. However, it was found efter the experi-
ments were finished that DK-19a increased grain size and fogginess in the film,
and that DK-60a was recommended.

A system of plane mirrors and a focusing lens and shutter were used to
record the time displayed cn the counter face on the film in the camera.

An over-all view of the apparatus is shown in Figure 72. The core model
is all but hidden by the collimator.

To get particle photographs, the core model was then reassembled with the
original island, the connecting inlet piping put in place, and clear water with
suspended tobacco seeds was pumped through the core at a desired flow rate and
temperature. The tracking light in the collimator and the automatic flashtube
firing and timing equipment were turned on. The procedure was then to open
the camera shutter, trigger the automatic stroboscopic equipment, and close

the shutter. The time displayed on the counter face was then photographed on

the same film through the shuttered lens and mirror system.

This procedure was repeated at least 100 times to obtain enough data to
completely map the velocity field in the core.

Typical data photographs are shown in Figures 73 and Tk. The velocity

data obtained was shown in Figure 23.

Phosphorescent Particle Flow Visualization

Flow visualization was accomplished by adding particles of Zn-CdS phosphor
to the water in the system. Their motion, which closely followed the motion of
the water, could then be observed by the light that they scattered from a colli-
mated plane of light parallel to the flow from a continuous high-intensity light
source,

By creating a beam of light of short duration, either by mechanically
"chopping" the collimated light from the continuous source (a high-pressure,
1000-w mercury-arc light), or by using the collimated light pulse from a high-
intensity electronic flashtube (such as the GE FT-503), the phosphor particles
in the flowing water in the path of the beam could be excited at a given in-
stant, thus "tagging" them; and, a short time later, as the band of glowing
particles deformed into a shape corresponding to the velocity profile of the
fluid, they could be observed.

A photograph of the mechanical chopper, which consisted of a solid ro-
tating disk with a cut-out sector whose angle could be changed, mounted on
the collimator is shown in Figure 75.

From this method, a qualitative idea of how the velocity profile looked
could be obtained. At the time of the core model experiments, no film was

found to be sensitive enough to register the glowing particles so that, in a

manner similar to stroboscopic particle photography, the velocities could
actually be measured. Recently, however, a feasibility study of photograph-

ing the band of excited phosphors as they distorted into a shape correspond-

ing to the velocity profile of water flowing in a tube was successful in ob-
taining photographs. + An experimental Eastman film with a speed of ASA 400-800
(s.o. 1177) was used in a 4 x 5-in. camera with a f1.8 lens. Eastman DK-60a
developer was used.

The method of making this method quantitative would be similar to the
stroboscopic particle photography method; the time between the excitation of
the particles and the taking of the photograph would be measured, and distances
obtained by comparison with a photograph of a similarly distorted grid, which
was previously placed in the plane of the motion of the excited particles.

Velocities are obtained from the division of distance by elapsed time.

APPENDIX B
FLOW SYSTEM COMPONENTS

Reservoir

A painted iron tank 40 in. deep and 24 in. in inside diameter served
as the system reservoir. The top was open and afforded ready access for
filling the system with water or adding particles for velocity measurement
work. A motor-driven stirrer provided agitation to keep the particles sus-
pended in the water. All connecting piping entered the reservoir under the
level of the water maintained while the system was in operation, thus avoid-

ing o'r entrainment from that source.

Centrifugal Pump
An Allis-Chalmers double-intake centrifugal pump with a 9-in. diameter

impeller driven by a 5-hp electric motor was used to pump water around the
flow circuit. The pump delivered 85 gpm at a 80-ft head. At shut-off, a
head of 84 ft was obtained.

At a later date, a 10 3/L4-in. impeller was substituted and a7 1/2-hp
electric motor was employed to drive the pump. With this arrangement, the
pump delivered 100 gpm at a 100-ft head. At shut-off, a head of 120 ft was

obtained. Figure 76 is a photograph of this pump and the reservoir.

Qrifice Meters
Two thin-plate VDI-type orifices made by the Taylor Instrument Company

having diameters of 1.530 and 0.765 in. were used alternately with a
~134-

-— -135- a

50-in. mercury-filled U-tube manometer connected across the orifice for meas-
uring core flow rates. These diameters corresponded to 1/2-pipe diameter and
1/4-pipe diameter, respectively.

A measurable flow rate range of one to 100 gpm was obtainable.

A 30-diameter length of straight pipe preceded the orifice position.

Rotameters
A Brooks rotameter with a measurement range of 0.5 to 6.0 gpm and a
Fischer and Porter rotameter of range 2 to 20 gpm were installed at a later

date than the flowmeters.

Control Valves
Three globe-type valves were connected in a parallel arrangement to give
good flow rate control over the entire range. A 3-in. valve, a l-in. valve,

and a 1/2-1in. valve were used.

Temperature Control

A calrod immersion heater and a cooling coil made of copper tubing with
cold water running through placed in the reservoir served to control the water

temperature.

Core Test Stand
The core models were assembled on a support which formed part of the re-
circulating loop system, and which served to align the inner and outer shells.
A quickly removable section of pipe which served as the inlet to the core
models facilitated access for changing or performing any alterations on the
core models.
5. A lev of the test stand with a core model in place on its support with

the removable inlet pipe in place was shown in Figure 11.
