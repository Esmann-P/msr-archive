FOREWORD

This quarterly progress report of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Project at ORNL records the
technical progress of the research on Circulating-Fuel Reactors and all other ANP research at
the Laboratory under its Contract W-7405-eng-26. The report is divided into three major parts: |.
Reactor Theory, Component Design and Testing, and Construction, Il. Materials Research, and
Ill. Shielding Research.

The ANP Project is comprised of about 300 technical and scientific personnel engaged in
many phases of research directed toward the achievement of nuclear propulsion of aircraft. A
considerable portion of this research is performed in support of the work of other organizations
participating in the national ANP effort. However, the bulk of the ANP research ot ORNL is
directed toward the development of a circulating-fuel type of reactor.

The effort on circulating-fuel reactors was, until recently, centered upon the Aircraft Reactor
Experiment. The equipment for this reactor experiment has been assembled, and the current
status of the experiment is summarized in Section 1 of Part |.

The design, construction, and operation of the Circulating-Fuel Reactor Experiment (CFRE),
with the cooperation of the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Division, are now the specific long-range
objectives. The CFRE is to be a power plant system that will include a §0-Mw circulating-fuel
reflector-moderated reactor and an adequate heat disposal system. Operation of the system will
be for the purpose of determining the feasibility and the problems associated with the design,

construction, and operation of a high-powered reflector-moderated aircraft reactor system. The

design work, as well as the supporting research on materials and problems peculiar to the CFRE

(previously included in the subject sections), is now reported as a subsection of Section 2,
‘‘Circulating-Fuel Reflector-Moderated Reactor.’’

The ANP research, in addition to that for the Circulating-Fuel Reactor Experiment, falls
into three general categories: studies of aircraft-size circulating-fuel reactors, materials problems
associated with advanced reactor designs, and studies of shields for nuclear aircraft. These

phases of research are covered in Parts |, Hl, and lll, respectively, of this report.

DESIGN AND TESTING, AND CONSTRUCTION

Circulating-Fuel Aircraft Reactor Experiment

The water tests of the fuel and the sodium cir-
cuits of the ARE system at room temperature were
completed (Sec. 1). The sodium circuit was pres-
sure-filled with water from the sodium fill tanks,
while the fuel system was vacuum-filled to ensure
the elimination of gas pockets in the fuel system.
Both systems were found to function properly, and
the filling, circulating, and draining operations

After

the water was drained, the system was dried by

were effected with a minimum of difficulty.

heating it to approximately 600°F. The electrical
heating system was found to be satisfactory in
the check thus afforded.

The final system completion work is now under
way, that is, removal of the sodium system reactor
bypass, completion of the fuel-enrichment system
installation, completion of thermocouple and insu-
lation installation, and other minor modifications.
When this work is completed, sodium will be
charged to the system and the high-temperature
checkout phase of the experiment will be initiated.

The neutron source was put into the reactor, and
the nuclear insfrumentation was checked out.
Also, mechanical checks were made of the per-
formance of the safety and control rods. The
building electric and helium systems were made
ready to accommodate the loading facilities, and
final arrangements were completed for attaching
the fuel-sampling equipment.

Radiation damage experiments indicated the de-
sirability of providing gamma shielding at several
points where elastomers were used (belts, dia-
phragms, etc.). Where shielding was impractical,
the composition diaphragms were replaced with
metal diaphragms.

The results of operation of the reactor system
component test loop at K-25 are encouraging in
that the loop has now been operated without major
difficulties for more than 1800 hr. None of the
minor difficulties encountered would indicate that
serious problems might arise in operation of the

ARE.

Reflector-Moderated Reactor

The program for the development and construc-
tion of the Circulating-Fuel Reactor Experiment
(CFRE) has heen outlined, and many of the de-
velopment projects are under way. Tentative
design data have been compiled and o flow sheet
has been prepared (Sec. 2). The first priority
development project, the test of beryllium in con-
tact with sodium and Inconel under thermal stress,
has been completed. The results of this test were
needed in the determination of the amount of
poison to be expected in the reflector. The test
indicated that beryllium will not crack under the
thermal stresses involved in the temperature range
1000 to 1300°F. Since corrosion and mass transfer,
as well as thermal stress, will be important in the
beryllium-Inconel-sodium system, many static and
dynamic tests under various conditions have been
made. There is considerable evidence to indicate
satisfactory compatibility in the beryllium-Inconel-
sodium system at temperatures up to 1200°F.

The temperature coefficient of reactivity for the
CFRE was computed on the UNIVAC and, for rapid

- temperature changes, was found fo be -3.5 x

10-3 °F. The critical mass computed for the
rhombicuboctahedral critical assembly was rede-
termined because of errors found in the original
data. The redetermined value agreed closely with
the experimental value, but, since the critical
mass is not very sensitive to errors in detail,
further evaluation of the agreement must await
additicnal experimental results.

Experimental Reactor Engineering

The emphasis in the engineering work is now
on development of components for an in-pile loop
for insertion in a horizontal beam hole of the MTR
and the design ond construction of forced-circu-
lation corrosion testing loops (Sec. 3). The in-pile
loop for insertion in the MTR is a joint ORNL and
Prait & Whitney Aircraft Division project. It is
to circulate proposed fuel mixtures in the high-flux
of the MTR so that the extent of radiation damage
to materials of construction and the effect of radi-
ation on the fuel can be determined. Two types
of pumps have been developed for in-pile use: a

AN |
ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

vertical-shaft centrifugal sump pump for instal-
lation external to the reactor shield and a hori-
zontal-shaft sump pump for insertion inside a beam
hole. A turbine-type impeller is being considered
for the horizontal-shaft pump because it would
have the advantage that both the inlet and dis-
charge could be at the bottom. Hydraulic motors
of suitably small dimensions have been found to
be satisfactory drives for these pumps.

Two series of Inconel forced-circulation cor-
rosion loops for circulating fluoride mixtures are
being developed to meet the following require-
ments: (1) a Reynolds number of 10,000 with
temperature gradients of 100, 200, and 300°F and
(2) a temperature gradient of 200°F with Reynolds
numbers of 800, 3,000, and 15,000. The maximum
fluid temperature is to be 1500°F.

A study is under way of the cavitation phe-
nomenon associated with operating liquid metal
systems at elevated temperatures, high flow rates,
and high pump speeds. A correlation of fluid-flow-
noise intensity with pressure data was noted.

The number of stations available for convection-
loop testing was increased from 18 to 31 and the
basic design of the loops was simplified. Various
means of heating the loops and of making operation
of them more automatic are being studied.

Critical Experiments

The first step of the present critical experiment
program was the construction of a small two-region
reflector-moderated reactor to provide experimental
data on a system of simple geometry and materials
for use in checking the calculational methods
being used (Sec. 4). The core consists of alter-
nate sheets of enriched uranium metal and Teflon
and is surrounded by a beryllium reflector. The
uranium loading can be varied, within the specified
dimensions, to make the system critical. The
assembly was loaded as prescribed by the multi-
group calculations but was not critical. However,
when the calculations had been corrected to take
into account errors in the original data, a new
attempt to achieve criticality with the prescribed
loading was made. The corrected prescribed
loading was 20.9 to 22.75 Ib of U?3% and the
experimental loading was 24.35 Ib of U235, A
larger critical assembly of the same shape is to
be constructed that will consist of three regions,
with the beryllium island and the reflector sepa-
rated by the fuel annulus. A further check on the
calculational methods will be obtained.

PART li. MATERIALS RESEARCH
Chemistry of Molten Materials

Studies of the fluoride systems of interest as
reactor fuels were continued, with particular em-
phasis being given to systems in which the
uranium-bearing component is the less corrosive
UF, or a mixture of UF, and UF, rather than UF,
alone (Sec. 5). Recent attempts to correlate the
anticipated reduction of UF, in the UF -bearing
melts with wet chemical analysis for UF, and
UF, and results of petrographic examination show
some surprising anomalies. When UF, dissolved
in LiF, in NoF-ZrF ,-UF, mixtures, or in NaF-LiF
mixtures is treated under flowing hydrogen at
800°C with excess uranium metal, 90% or more
of the UF, is reduced to UF. However, when
this technique is applied to UF, in NaF-KF-LiF
mixtures, the reduction is only 50% complete at
800°C and, perhaps, 75% complete at 600°C.
Petrographic examinations of the specimens reveal
no complex compounds of tetravalent uranium; it
is possible that the UF, is “hidden” in solid
solutions or in complex UF ,-UF, compounds in
which it is not at present recognizable.

Solid phase studies of the NaF-ZrF ,-UF, system
were initiated following completion of studies of
the NaF-ZrF, system, and to date no ternary com-
pounds have been discovered. A tentative equi-
librium diagram was prepared.

A method for large-scale purification of rubidium
fluoride has been developed that can be used if
material sufficiently free from cesium cannot be
obtained from commercial sources. Fundamental
studies of the reduction of Nif, and FeF, by H,
in NaF-ZrF, systems were made as a means of
determining possible improvements in purification
techniques. Also, methods for preparing simple
structural metal fluorides were studied.

Large quantities of puritied ZrF,-base fluorides
were prepared for engineering tests at ORNL and
elsewhere, and the demand for purified fluorides
of other types is rapidly increasing. Therefore
preparation and purification methods have been
studied intensively in an effort to lower production
time and costs. Developments indicate that the
price of purified NaZrF¢ and NaF-ZrF -UF, mix-
tures may be halved in the next few months.

Corrosion Research

The static and seesaw corrosion testing fa-
cilities were used for further studies of brazing

 
alloys, special Stellite heats, Hastelfoy R, In-
conel, graphite, and various ceramics in sodium,
fluoride fuel mixtures, and other mediums {Sec. 6).
The brazing alloy 67% Ni-13% Ge-11% Cr-6%
Si-2% Fe-~1% Mn was found to have good corrosion
resistance in fluoride fuels and fair corrosion
resistance in sodium and therefore will be useful
for the fabrication of many reactor components.

In the thermal-convection loop studies, UF ,-
bearing fuels were tested in Inconel. Hot-leg
attack is not found in Inconel loops in which ZrF -
base fluoride mixtures with the uranium as UF,
are circulated. A deposit is, however, found on
the hot-leg surface. Only preliminary information
is available, but it appears that neither attack
nor a hot-leg layer is found with alkali-metal-base
fluoride mixtures containing UF;. Mixtures of
UF, and UF, result in a reduction in attack from
that found with only UF, but some attack is
present, and in high-uranium-content systems the
attack may be significant,

Several Hastelloy B loops have now been suc-
cessfully operated in both the as-received and the
over-aged conditions. In both cases a consider-
able increase in hardness occurs during operation.
With ZrF,-base mixtures containing UF, very
little attack is found, even after 1000 hr.

Thermal-convection loop tests of molten lithium
in type 316 stainless steel were operated for 1000
hr. There were no signs of plug formation, and
only a small amount of mass transferred material
was found in one loop. Alloys of 45% Cr—55% Co,
Ni-Mo alloys, and the Fe-Cr-base stainless steels
have been shown to be more resistant to corrosion
and mass transfer in liquid lead than are the pure
metals. Their resistance to mass transfer can
probably be related to the formation of interme-
tallic compounds.

Metallurgy

Creep and stress-rupture testing by the tube-
burst method has been studied intensively (Sec. 7).
In the tube-burst tests, a tube that is closed at
one end is stressed with an internal gas pressure.
The stress pattern introduced into the specimen
in this test approaches the stress pattern that will
be found in ANP-type reactors. Apparatus for the
tests has been constructed, and a theoretical
analysis has been made with which a check on the
experimental results can be obtained.

In the investigation of high thermal-conductivity

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1954

fins for sodium-to-air radiators, stress-rupture and
creep tests were made on copper fins with various
types of cladding at stress levels between 500 and
2000 psi at 1500°F. The tests show that for a
1000-hr exposure in air, stresses greater than 500
psi and less than 1000 psi are tolerable; that is,
in this stress range there is no indication of
brittleness in the core or oxidation of the core
due to cladding failure of type-310 stainless-steel-
clad copper fins. From the over-all considerations
of melting point, oxidation resistance, dilution of
fin and tube wall, formation of low-melting eu-
tectics, and flowability, it was found that Coast
Metals alloy 52 was the best brazing alloy for
use in the construction of radiators with high-
conductivity fins. A sodium-to-air radiator with
6 in. of type-430 stainless-steel-clad copper high-
conductivity fins was fabricated by use of a combi-
nation heliarc welding and brazing procedure.

Packed-rod nozzle assemblies were fabricated
for the 100-kw gas-fired liquid-metal-heater system,
and work was started on the formation of duplex
tubing. An attempt is being made to prepare tubing
that will have good corrosion resistance on the
inner surface and oxidation resistance on the outer
surface.

Attempts are being made to find new alloys in
the nickel-molybdenum system that will have better
high-temperature strength and fluoride corrosion
resistance than Inconel has. Hastelloy B satisfies
these requirements, but it has poor fabrication
properties and oxidation resistance; it also loses
its ductility in the temperature range of interest
for application in high-temperature circulating-fuel
reactors. Investigations are under way to find a
suitable melting practice and heating treatment
that will increase the ductility of Hastelloy B in
the temperature range of interest.

Heat Transfer and Physical Properties

The enthalpies and heat capacities of NaF-ZrF ,-
UF (65-15-20 mole %) and of LiF-NaF.UF  (57.6-
38.4-4.0 mole %) were determined (Sec. 8). The
thermal conductivity of NaF-KF-UF,& (46.5-26.0-
27.5 mole %) was found to be 0.7 Btu/hr.ft2(°F /ft),
that for KF-LiF-NaF-UF, (43.5-44,5-10.9-1.1 mole
%) was 2.0, and that for LiF-KF-UF, (48.0-48.0-
4.0 mole %) was 1.4. A new electrical conduc-
tivity device has been constructed and has been
successfully checked with molten salts of known
conductivity.
ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

A device for studying the rates of growth of
tube-wall deposits has been successfully tested
with a simple heat transfer salt. Also, a hydro-
dynamic flow system for studying the reflector-
moderated reactor flow structure has been tested.
A mathematical study of the temperature structure
in converging and in diverging channe! systems
that duct fluids with volumetric heat sources and
a study of wall cooling requirements in circulating-
fuel reactors were made.

Radiation Damoge

Additional irradiations of Inconel capsules con-
taining fluoride mixtures were carried out in the
MTR (Sec. 9).
UF ;-bearing fuel has been examined, and it shows
no corrosion, in contrast to that found previously
with UF ,-bearing fuels.

Inspection of the LITR in-pile loop, which failed
prior to startup, disclosed that the failure was
caused by u break in the weld connecting the pump

Only one capsule containing a

discharge nipple to the fuel line. Design revisions
and refabrication of some of the parts are in prog-
ress. Developmental work continued on a smaller
loop for operation in an L.ITR A-piece.

Detailed examination of an Inconzl loop which
circulated sodium at high temperature in the ORNL
Graphite Reactor showed no evidence of radiation-
induced corrosion. Metallographic examinations
were corried out in the hot cells on irradiated fue!
plates for Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Division, and
studies were made on annealing-out of fission-
fragment damage. Work continued on examination
of wire and multiple-plate-type units for GE-ANP,

Anclytical Studies of Reactor Materials

The primary analytical problem continues to be

tetravalent uranium in both NaF-ZrF, and Naf-
KF-LiF-bose fuels (Sec. 10).

A successful po-
in molten NaZrF

UF, of less than 1 mg/g.
NaAICl, is expecied to dissolve tetravalent ura-
nium selectively from the fuels.

Calibration measurements have been completed
on the apparatus for the determination of oxygen

involves the hydrofluorination of the oxide and
measurement of the increase in conductivity of
liquid HF as o function of the water formed. In-
vestigations are being made of the oxidation of
UF, and of UF, with oxygen at elevated tempera-
tures,

An improved method for the determination of
lithium in NaF-KF-LiF-base fuels was developed.
Also, studies were made of the solubilities of
potassium, rubidium, and cesium tetraphenyl-
borates in various organic solvents to ascertain
differential solubilities.

PART ill. SHIELDING RESEARCH
Shielding Analysis

Application of the Monte Carlo method to the
calculation of crew
shield sides has been worked out, and the method
appears to be quite satisfactory for this type of
problem (Sec. 11). Considerable progress has been
made on understanding the Tower Shielding Fa-
cility (TSF) measurements of ground and air
scattering. Expressions have been derived which
describe the effect of ground interference with the
air-scattered flux, and thus it is now possible to
estimate ground-scatiered radiation both at the
TSF and in on airplane at londing and takeoff,

of gamma-ray penetration

Calculations have been set up for evaluating

multiply scattered radiation in air, The values
obtained will be of considerable importance in
studies of the highly asymmetric but light shields

of several current designs.

Lid Tank Shielding Facility

Preparations for a second series of shielding
tests for the reflector-moderated reactor at the
Lid Tank Shielding Facility (LTSF) have included
f a large tank which will hold
all the components of the mockups and the irradi-
ation of the UF C.F, solution which may be
used to simulate the reactor fue! in mockup ex-
periments (Sec. 12). Measurements of the removal
cross section of corbon made in a continuous
carbon resulted in o value of
o, = 0.750 barn. This is to be compared with the
previous value of 0.81 + 0.05 barn measured behind
a solid slab of graphite. Thermal-neutron flux

figurations of GE-ANP helical air ducts, a single
duct and g triangular array of three ducts.

Bulk Shielding Facility

The use of a graphite reflector as a shield com-
ponent has been investigated at the Bulk Shielding
Facility (BSF) with measurements of attenuation
through various thicknesses of the material (Sec.
13). The fast-neutron spectrum of the BSF reactor
from 1.3 to 10 Mev through 1 ft of graphite was
also measured. Removal cross section values for
the carbon were determined to be 0.82 barn for a
1-#t slab, 0.84 barn for a 2-ft slab, and 0.80 barn
for a 3-ft slab.

An experiment has been performed at the BSF
to provide an experimental basis for future esti-
mates of the amount of visible light around a
nuclear-powered aircraft. Measurements in an air-
filled tube placed against the reactor have indi-
cated that the maximum glow will occur at a
pressure corresponding to an altitude of about
30,000 ft.

In a proposed method for the determination of
the power of the ARE, the relative activity of the

fuel samples exposed in the ARE and in the known
flux of another reactor is measured. The method
has been tested at the BSF.

Tower Shielding Facility

Measurements of the ground ond oir scattering
of neutrons’ have been made at the Tower Shielding
Facility (TSF) (Sec. 14). A preliminary analysis
indicates that the contribution at the maximum
altitudes (around 200 ft) is between 2 and 5% of
the total scattered neutrons for differential ex-
periments.

A new procedure for a calorimetric determination
of the power of the TSF reactor has been devised
which is based on the relationship between the
rate of temperature rise in the water of the reactor
tank and the reactor power. The results of three
experiments were consistent to within 1%. The
next series of tests at the TSF will be on the
GE-ANP R-1 divided-shield mockup.

AND TESTING, AND CONSTRUCTION
1. CIRCULATING-FUEL AIRCRAFT REACTOR EXPERIMENT

THE EXPERIMENTAL REACTOR SYSTEM

A general revision was found to be necessary
in the ARE in that shadow shielding had to be
installed, at several points where elastomers were
used (belts, diaphragms, efc.),to provide protection
from gamma fields that would: have produced pro-
hibitive degrees of radiation damage. At some
points, where shielding was impractical, the compo-
sition diaphragms were replaced by metal dia-
phragms.

The entire ARE system has now been completely
checked out as far as room-temperature preoper-
ational tests are concerned. Both the fuel and the
sodium circuits have been operated simultaneously
with water as the circulated liquid in each circuit.
The moderator volume of the reactor was bypassed
for these tests to keep water away from the be-
ryllium oxide blocks.

The sodium circuit was pressure-filled with
water from the sodium fill tanks, while the fuel
system was vacuum-filled to ensure the elimination
of gas pockets in the fuel system. Both systems
were found to function quite satisfactorily, and the
filling, circulating, and draining operations were
effected with a minimum of difficulty.

During these operational shakedown tests, it was
found that the gas lines to the sump tanks could
not be kept pressure tight because the Swagelok
fittings developed leaks. All these joints have
therefore been silver-soldered to correct this
situation, The pumps performed satisfactorily,
and useful system curves for actual future operation
were obtained.

After the water tests of the system had been
completed, it was necessary to remove all water
from the system. This necessitated heating the
entire system to a temperature of approximately
600°F. This operation provided the first check out
of the electrical heating system. Here again the
performance was gratifying. Such troubles as
arose were corrected rather easily, and, in general,
the heating of the system was effected with very
little difficulty.

A CO, cold trap was incorporated in the off-gas
line while the system was being heated to collect
all moisture that was driven from the system. Dry

air was admitted to the fill tanks, and both the
fuel and the sodium systems were flushed with
this dry air, the air leaving the system through the
CO, cold trap. When the dew point of the exit air
from this cold trap reached ~30°F, the system was
considered to be dry and the electrical heat was
turned off.

Before the heat was removed from the system,
however, the temperature on the thermal barrier
doors around the heat exchangers was raised to
approximately 1000°F and operation of the doors
was checked. Even though the doors had been
reworked to eliminate sticking, it was found that
the doors were still binding. When the barrier
doors were removed, it could be seen that the side
guides whichrun the height of the door were binding
in the guide ways of the door frames. This binding
was resulting from the bowing of the guide rails
caused by the thermal gradient which exists in the
door. The door does not require these side guides,
since the door housing provides ample guides for
the normal functioning of the doors. Therefore the
side guide rails are being removed so that there
will be no further binding of the barrier doors.

It was also noted while the system was hot that a
considerable volume of kerosene was being driven
out of the beryllium oxide moderator blocks by: the
high temperature. The kerosene had been absorbed
by the blocks during the cutting operations. To
remove the kerosene, a vacuum was pulled on the
moderator volume of the reactor. A CO, cold trap
was inserted in the vacuum line to the moderator,
and while the reactor was maintained at a temper
ature of approximately 450°F, the vacuum pump was
run continuously. This operation was continued
until no more condensate of the kerosene distillation
was being collected in the cold trap. Approxi-
mately 2 gal of kerosene was removed by this
procedure. lt is possible ~ in fact, fairly certain —
that some residue was left in the moderator blocks.
It was the consensus of the chemists that this
would not have an adverse effect on the sodium
coolant, and therefore nothing further is to be done
about the small amount of tarry residue remaining
in the reactor moderator blocks.
ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

After the system had been thoroughly dried, all
heat was turned off and the final system completion
work was begun. The major work in this category
consists in removing the sodium system reactor
bypass, removing the flanged filter pots in the
sodium purification system, and completing the
enrichment system tie-in to the fuel circuit. Ther-
mocouple installation also has to be completed,
as well as thermal insulation of the fuel pump
bowls.

The decision to remove the flanged filter pots
and to substitute weld-sealed filter pots was made
several months ago. It was decided at that time,
however, to postpone this substitution until after
the water test. The original filters were useful in
cleaning up the water used to test the operation of
the sodium circuit, Completion of the fuel enrich-
ment system in no way affected the water test, and
hence this work was postponed in the interest of
completing the water test as expeditiously os
possible. The fuel injection system is to be
water-tested independently of the fue! system.

Insulation of the fuel pump bowls was postponed
to allow more room for access to the pumps during
the water tests. Since the pumps have now been
checked out, the insulation job will be completed.

The system should be ready for charging with
sodium early in September, and the high-tempera-
ture check out phase of the experiment will be
initiated. While the sodium checks are being run,
the hot-gas leak test of the fuel system will be
performed, This test involves loading the fuel
system with a mixture of helium and krypion at a
While this gas is being
circulated at 1300°F by the fuel pump the annulus
circuits will be monitored by mass spectrographic
methods for the presence of krypton in the annulus.

pressure of about 15 psi.

The nsutron source was put in the reactor, and
the nuclear instrumentation was checked out. All
three (the two regular plus the spare) fission
chambers checked, and the count-rate vs
chamber-voltage curves were plotted. The datu
obtained provided the necessary information for
establishing the operational plateau for each
Also, mechanical checks were made of
the performance of the safety and control rods.

A modification of the rod-cooling circuit was
required in order to minimize the heat loss from the
center of the reactor. This necessitated instal

Final modifications of the sodium and the fuel
loading systems were completed, and the building
electric ond helium systems were made ready to
accommodate the loading facilities when they are
brought into the building. Final arrangements
have been completed for attaching the fuel-sampling
system. This sampling system will not be left
connected when the power run is initiated.

The engineering prints for the entire ARE instal-
lation are now up to date, and the electrical prints,
in particular, were used successfully in checking
out the many heater circuits involved in the experi-
ment,

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FUEL AND THE
SODIUM SYSTEMS DURING WATER TESTS

The characteristics of both the fuel and the
sodium systems while circulating water have been
determined. Upon removal of the fuel heat ex-
changer bypass loop, a glass rotameter was tempo-
rarily installed in the fuel circuit between the
reactor outlet and the heat exchangers. A direct
calibration of the high-temperature fue! rotameter
against the glass rotameter was obtained with
water as the fluid. Conversion of water flow to
fuel flow! is made by

During the period of water operation, data on

Also, the pressure head from the pump suction to
the reactor inlet was measured (Fig. 1.2). The
system characteristics, as shown in these two
curves, should be the same during operation with
fluorides.

Fig. 1.2. Data on Pressure Head from the Pump
Suction to the Reactor Inlet vs the Flow Rate
During Water Test of ARE Fuel System.

By using a calibrated orifice installed tempo-
rarily in the sodium bypass line around the reactor,
it was possible to measure the flow rate while
operating the sodium system with water. The
pump speed was recorded and also the pressure
head from the pump suction to the reactor outlet.
The system characteristics with water, shown in
Figs. 1.3 and 1.4, should be valid while operating
with sodium as the fluid. During operation with
sodium, the flow rate in each of the two loops will
be measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter,
The sum of the two flow rates should equal the
total flow as obtained from the pump speed.

G. J. Nessle
Materials Chemistry Division

All the preliminary preparations for loading the
barren and enriched fluoride mixtures into the ARE
have been completed. The necessary control
panels have been assembled, and furnaces, heating
units, transfer lines, and various complementary
equipment are now ready for installation. The
exact location of the various operations has been
determined. However, because of the large amount
of construction work which has been carried out in

il
ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

the ARE building around these locations, none of
the parts necessary for the loading and sampling
operations have yet been installed. Testing of the
equipment after installation and before the filling
operation should require approximately ore week.
It is anticipated that all personnel to be involved
with the loading and sampling operation will be
made thoroughly familiar with the equipment and
its operation during this testing period.

of 1300°F could be maintained in the injection
tube by using about 140 amp from a high-current
transformer, This nozzle test was considered
satisfactory to meet the operating requirements for
the ARE enrichment system,

ARE UNLOADING EXPERIMENT

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

The mockup of the ARE unloading apparatus was
tested twice. In the first test the storage tank
was filled with 750 Ib of NaZiF,, which was
successfully unloaded in 90-Ib increments into
aluminum cans. In two cases, however, the battoms
of the aluminum cans melted and the fluoride
mixture leaked out.

Modifications made in the apparatus before the
second test included improvements in the pouring
and the pressure

spout, the level indicators,

measuring equipment. In addition, small amounts
of the fluoride mixture were frozen in the bottoms
of the aluminum cans to minimize the possibility
of melting these containers.

For the second test the apparatus was filled
with 500 1b of NaF-ZrF , (50-50 mole %), and this
material was fransferred at 1200 to 1250°F to the
aluminum cans in 70- to 90-Ib increments without
difficulty. Attempts fo transfer at 1100 to 1150°F,
however, led to occasional freezing at the pouring
spout and indicated that unless much more reliable
temperature control could be effected, operation
at this low temperature could hardly be considered
to be feasible.

ARE FUEL RECOVERY AND REPROCESSING

D. E. Ferguson G. I. Cathers

Chemical Technology Division

A fluoride-volatility method of processing ARE
fuel, based on elemental fluorination of the molten
NaF-ZiF ,-UF,, has been investigated because of

its attractiveness from the standpoint of cost,
inventory of fissionable material, waste disposal,

and safety of operation. In preliminary tests
than 92.95% of the uranium tetrafluoride
contained in the fuel was converted to the volatile

would be performed in order to obtain complete
decontamination, could be carried out in only lightly

Two experiments on scrubbing UF, with molten
NaF-ZrF, were carried out. In one, an acetone—dry
ice cold trap was used between the fiuorination and
scrub steps; the uranium hexafluoride was con-
densed (and thus separated from excess fluorine)
in the cold trap and was then resublimed from it,

trap was used, but the decontamination obtained
was the same (Table 1.1). It is thought that
resublimation of the salt-scrubbed product would
achieve additional decontamination.

runs by dissolving a 224-day-irradiated, 30-day-

ARE PUMPS

Fabrication and Testing

WW. G. Cobb A. G. Grindell

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

Five of the six rotary elements fabricated for
ARE pumps have passed all acceptance tests.
The sixth rotary element is being used in the hot
shakedown test stand to test welded-fabricated

Inconel impellers and for other miscellaneous
testing.
Unsuccessful attempts were made by ORNL

and by an outside vendor to lap the bronze bearing
wear surfaces of the upper oil seals for the shaft
to an acceptable flatness (three wave bands of
helium light) with a water soluble scouring agent,
Bon-Ami. However, acceptable flatness was
attained with conventional lapping compounds.

Four ARE pumps with welded-fabricated impellers
have been installed in the ARE. The impellers
used were four of the six welded-fabricated im-
pellers that have passed all acceptance tests.
One of the impellers is being used in the pump in
the reactor system component test loop at K-25
and one is being held as a spare.

Seal-Gas Pressure-Balancing System

W. G. Cobb

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

A seal-gas pressure-balancing system was de-
veloped and has been installed in the ARE pumps.
This system automatically maintains a gas pressure
in the lubricant chamber around the lower me-
chanical seal that is slightly higher (% to 2 psi)
than the pressure in the pump tank volume in order
to impede the outward leakage of vapors into the
lubricating-oil system. The equipment involved
consists of a differential supply valve, a differ-
ential vent valve, and the requisite pipe con-
nections. In addition to providing a master-slave
relationship for maintaining the pressure differ-
ential across the seal, the system has two charac-
teristics which are advantageous to ARE pump
operation, The first advantage is that it will
provide automatic bleed-off of excessive oil system
pressures created by the gas which will be evolved
from irradiation of the lubricating oil. The second
advantage is that it will maintain a greater (Y= to
2-psi) pressure across the lower seal even when
subatmospheric pressures are introduced to the
pump tank, for example, when the ARE fuel system
is being vacuum filled.

Radiation Damage to Pump Drives

W. G, Cobb A. G. Grindell

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

Some alternatives to the usual V-belt pump-

power transmission investigated
in an attempt to find a system that would not be
affected by radiation. The alternatives studied in-

cluded direct in-line drives, angle-gear-box drives,

system were

silent-chain drives, and improved V-belt drives.
The use of direct drives would have required
modification of the concrete shielding above the
pump pits, and the use of the angle-gear-box drive
would have required development of suitable lubri-
cant seals. The silent-chain drive tested did not
have the required mechanical reliability.

Two improved V-belts, a Browning B-105 Super-
grip belt (rayon cords in a neoprene matrix) and a
Browning B-103 Grip belt (cotton cords in a rubber
matrix), were irradiated, under operating tension,
through a short length of the belt by a Co? source
to total doses of 10% and 107 rep, respectively.

ment at 1600 rpm with no pump load. After 90 hr
of operation, the B-105 belt showed no visible
damage and was returned to ARE personnel. After
75 hr of operation, the B-103 belt showed no visible
damage and was transferred to the pump in the
reactor component test loop pump to transmit 3 hp
at 800 rpm. This belt, which has now been in
service for more than 900 hr, has increased in
length approximately 1 in. Failure of the belt
does not appear to be imminent, and pump operation
has not been affected. An idler pulley is used to
maintain tension,

On the basis of these tests, it was decided to
use the cofton-corded, rubber-matrix V-belts on
the fuel and the sodium pumps in the ARE. As an
additional safeguard, the belt on the fuel pump
drive will be shielded with lead.

Radiation Damage to Shaft Seal
W. G. Cobb J. M. Trummel

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

Solid State Division

The rotary subassembly of the ARE pump con-
tains six Buna-N O-ring static seals which will
receive radiation during reactor operation. To get
information on the expected life of these seals,
an O-ring sealing arrangement similar to two of
the pump seals was constructed and was placed in
the LITR flux. The test assembly included six
radial O-ring seals and three gasket O-ring seals.
One side of the seals was supplied with oil at
75-psig pressure, and the other side was vented to
the reactor off-gas system through bubblers and a
catch tank so that it was possible to detect any
appreciable leakage by the seals. Since the seals

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1954

were vented in four groups, it wos possible to get
some information on variations in seal life. Differ-
ences in the following might produce such vari-
ations: (1) flux density over test assembly,
(2) twisting and rolling of the rings during assembly
for testing, (3) the O-rings, and (4) the machined
parts.

The gomma radiation intensity at the test lo-
cation in the LITR was estimated by extrapolation
from data taken on the Bulk Shielding Facility.”
The neutron flux was negligible. The results are
reported in Table 1.2, which gives time of irradi-
ation to first observed leakage and the total esti-
mated dose to first leakage. Examination of the
O-rings after irradiation revealed substantial
hardening. No appreciable elastic recovery of the
rings occurred upon removal from the container.

The O-rings to be used in the ARE will not be
in sohigh a flux as that used for these experiments,
and they will be under much lower pressures.
Since it is not essential in the ARE application
that the O-rings retain their resiliency, the results
of these experiments do not have immediate signifi-
cance. It is evident from these tests, however,
that O-rings cannot be used successfully in future
high-power reactor applications.

2. REFLECTOR-MODERATED REACTOR
A. P. Fraas

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

Four years of work on the ANP Project at ORNL
have led to the belief that the circulating-fluoride-
fuel reactor with reflector moderation and a spheri-
cal-shell heat exchanger can: be developed into
an aircraft power plant of exceptionally high per-
formance.! This view has been supported ‘in
recent months by the results of studies by USAF
contractors. = The question has now become how
best to bridge the gap between the ARE and a
prototype aircraft power plant.

It was proposed about a year ago that a 50-Mw
reactor be built so that the feasibility of con-
structing and operating a circulating-fuel reflector-
moderated reactor could be investigated and its
performance characteristics, particularly with ref-
erence to control, shielding, heat transfer, and fluid
flow, could be determined.
indicated that a power of at least 25 Mw would
be required to disclose the more important control
characteristics. Other studies indicated that on
output of 50 Mw would be required for the lowest
powered aircraft likely to be tactically useful (for
radar picket ships, patrol bombers, etc.), while
an output of 150 to 200 Mw would be required {with
chemical-fuel agugmentation) to power a strategic

Preliminary estimates

bomber. Preliminary reactor test unit designs and
cost estimates indicated that the time and cost
involved would be roughly proportional to the rated
output of the reactor (largely because the size
and cost of the heat exchangers, pumps, and heat-
dump equipment vary directly with reactor power).
After much analysis and discussion it was decided
that 60 Mw represented a good compromise for the
power rating -and that such a reactor, to be called
the Circulating-Fuel Reactor Experiment (CFRE),
should be built by ORNL, with the aid of the
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Division. This test unit
is to embody the basic features and proportions
that have made the circulating-fuel reactor at-
tractive for aircraft use, but the details of the
pumps, radiators, and cuxiliory equipment will not
have to meet aircraft requirements of size, weight,
etc. An operating life of 500 hr, of which a sub-
stantial portion should be at or near 60 Mw, was

considered to be a desirable goal. The information
gained from this project should serve to provide
a sound basis for the design of the full-scale
aircraft reactor,

As has been the case with the ARE, the CFRE
will require a major supporting effort on the part
of various groups in the ORNL organization to
obtain much essential information not yet avail-
able. The program on fuel chemistry, for example,
will continue along the lines it has followed. The
results of research on both the basic chemistry
and the in-pile and out-of-pile corrosion tests are
obviously vital to the project. Metallurgical re-
search on promising alloys, welding and brazing
techniques, strength properties at various tempera-
tures and in various ambients, and related work
will help greatly to increase the reliability, and
possibly the operating temperature, of the system.
Tests under way aot the Tower Shielding Facility
coupled with further Lid Tank Shielding Facility
tests will provide a more complete basis for the
aircraft shield design. Multigroup calculations
coupled with critical experiments should provide
additional information on the static physics of
the reactor. Much test work in experimental engi-
neering will be required to validate key features
of the design.

pedient. large blowers coupled to banks of NaK-
to-air radiators will be used to provide heat dumps
that will be simpler, more reliable, and easier to
control than turbojet engines. While conventional
heat exchangers like those of the ARE might be

type radiators should cost little more and that they

give a thermal inertia and a NaK transit time es-
sentially the same as those for a full-scale aircraft
power plant. The fabricating and operating ex-
perience obtained should also prove to be quite
valuable. It appears that d-c motors will be the
most practical means for driving the various pumps
in the system, but the blowers will probably be
driven by a-c motors, with control being effected
by the use of air bypass valves and/or shutters.

and 2.2, and a flow sheet for the system is given
in Fig. 2.1. The mojor components are shown

CFRE COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
The projected design effort for the CFRE has

been tied closely to a comprehensive series of
component development projects. A list of these
projects as currently conceived is given in Table
2.5. lt is fully expected that the need for ad-
ditional projects will develop as the program
evolves, but those listed should provide the most
important information required.

The first project was completed recently, and
the results are presented below; work on some of
the other projects is well under way. The test
of beryllium in contact with sodium and Inconel
under thermal stress was given high priority be-
cause the results were needed in the determination
of the amount of poison to be expected in the

reflector. With the amount of poison in the re-

flector known, the reactor critical mass, the core
size, the fuel concentration, etc. could be de-
termined. In the second test, which is well under
way, the hydrodynamics of the pump-volute, ple-
num-chamber, and core system are being studied.
Work on the same basic problem is also being done
by the Heat Transfer and Physical Properties
Group and by the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Di-
vision, lt is hoped that the different approaches
of the three groups will lead to a thoroughly sound
solution. The objective of the third project is to
produce a plastic mode! of a pump and header-tank
arrangement that will remove xenon from the fuel.
Data on the solubility of xenon in the fuel and on
the rate of production of xenon in the fuel are
being obtained by the Fuel Chemistry and Radi-
ation Damage groups; the data thus obtained will
provide a measure of the efficiency of xenon re-
moval by the pump. An in-pile test of a full-scale
pump may be required eventually. Xenon removal
by the pump is very important, from the control
standpoint; in addition, if it can be effected as
planned, the bulk of the other volatile fission
products will also be removed, This will dispose
of a major potential hazard in the event of a
reactor failure and should simplify the reactor
installation design problem.

The information given in Table 2.5 for most
of the other component development projects is
largely self-explanatory. To expedite the work,
some of the projects can be undertaken by other
organizations; for example, another organization
might undertake the entire job of designing, de-
veloping, and fabricating the fill-and-drain system,
the fuel addition equipment, the control rod drive

mechanism, or the sample heat exchanger tube

bundle.

The last project listed, the Zero Power Unit
(ZPU), deserves special mention. Experience with
the ARE has demonstrated that many problems will
arise in the fabrication of the CFRE and that there
will be o number of doubtful items, especially
welds, that could hardly be trusted in a high-power
reactor. This seems particularly true of the re-
actor core, heat exchanger, and pressure shell
assembly. If it is accepted that the first attempt
at fabricating the unit will leave much to be de-
sired, planning to use it as a hot mockup seems
to be more sensible than spending much time and
money trying to rework and patch it. It can be

endurance-tested ot temperature without developing

nuclear power. Even if a leak should develop in
one of the welds, there would be no serious con-
tamination problem. Upon completion of the en-
durance test, it should not be difficult to make a
thorough inspection of the parts ~ something that
could hardly be done after sustained operation at
high nuclear power.

At first thought, the ZPU might appear to delay
the program, but closer inspection indicates that
it may actually save a substantial amount of time,
because efforts to get it into operation can proceed
at full speed without the inevitable hazards, re-

20

straints, inhibitions, and hesitations that would
accompany high nuclear power operation. Work on
the CFRE can proceed at o more deliberate pace,
and the mistakes disclosed by work on the ZPU
can be avoided. The degree to which the ZPU
will be a mockup of the CFRE will depend upon
the problems that develop in the course of the
component test work. It is hoped that a 10-Mw
gas-fired furnace can be used, in place of one of
the two CFRE heat dumps, in making some heat
transfer tests on the fluoride-to-NaK heat ex-
changer and in obtaining a temperature gradient

The three-group, three-region code for reactor
statics calculations® on the ORACLE has been
completed. The temperature effects for the CFRE
were computed on the UNIVAC for three reactors:
a 50-Mw reactor with Inconel coolant tubes in the
reflector, a reactor without these tubes, and a
reactor in which the Inconel in the core shells was
replaced by columbium clad with 0.010 in. of
Inconel. The temperature coefficient for rapid
temperature changes turned out to be about —3.5 x
10-5 /°F, and the temperature coefficient for slow
effects is —2.6 x 1073 /°F for the heavily poisoned
reactor with the Inconel coolant tubes, but it in-
creases to —3.3 x 107°/°F and ~3.8 x 107° °F,
respectively, for the reactor without the Inconel
coolant tubes and the reactor with the Inconel-clad
columbium core shells,

ect. A report on the results of the latter calcu-
lations is being prepared und will be issued by the
Curtiss-Wright Corp.

A redetermination of the critical mass for the
(CA-19)

was found to be necessary because of an error in

rhombicuboctahedron critical assembly
carbon transport cross-section scaling, a differ-
ence in reflector geometry from that assumed for
the original calculations, and an actual Teflon
density lower than that used in the calculations.
In addition, a small correction (about 1% of critical
mass) was made for the presence of the aluminum
lattice supporting the reactor and for the aluminum
control rod sheaths.

The eigenvalues of the difference-equation ap-
proximation to the age-diffusion differential equa-
tion vary with lattice spacing. Calculations were
therefore made with three different spacings in
order to evaluate this effect. A foil of 0.004 in.
thickness was used in the calculations. The
results, corrected as mentioned in the preceding
paragraph, are given in the following:

Space Interval, Ar Calculated Critical Mass

(cm) (Ib)

0.457 22.75
0.914 21.47
1.828 20.91

The data are plotted in Fig. 2.2. A Lagrangian
extrapolation to a zero lattice spacing gives a
critical mass estimate of 24.70 Ib. The assembly
became critical at a loading of 24.35 Ib of U235,

It is recognized that the agreement between
calculation and experiment may well be fortuitous,
since the critical mass is not very sensitive to
errors in detail. Further evaluation of agreement
{or lack thereof) must await additional experi-
mental results. Calculations are now being made
for the next critical assemblies, that is, the three-
region assemblies consisting of a beryllium island
and reflector with a Teflon and uranium-foil fuel
annulus. The fuel annulus will be surrounded by
core shells; aluminum core shells will be used for
one assembly and Inconel for the next.

tube bank to the corresponding holes in the be-
ryllium block, through the upper tube back into
the outlet header, out to the radiator section, and
back to the pump. Banks of tubes were used to
duct the sodium to and from the block to minimize
the flow of electrical current through the sodium
inlet and outlet header tanks. A bypass filter
arrangement was provided, as well as bypass
cooling flow to the sodium-filled lugs connected
to the transformer bus bars.

The high-power-density volume heat source
coupled with transverse sodium flow through the
drilled holes gave a high thermal gradient around
the holes. During the course of the test the power
density was cycled regularly by alternating the

28

operating conditions as shown in Table 2.6, which
also compares the operating conditions for the
thermal stress test with those for the CFRE.

The test included an initial 100-hr period at a
constant high power density followed by power
cycling at the rate of one cycle per day. The
changes from one power level to the other were,
in all cases, performed at a fairly uniform rate in
a l-min interval. The test was concluded after
1000 hr of operation, including 36 cycles. The
beryllium sample is now being examined by the
Metallurgy Division for dimensional stability and
evidence of mass transfer, corrosion, or erosion.
Visual inspection of the sample after the test
indicated that no distortion, cracking, or erosion
of the beryllium had taken place.

BERYLLIUM-INCONEL-SODIUM SYSTEMS

The compatibility of sodium, beryllium, and In-
conel has been studied by using whirligig, seesaw,
thermal-convection-loop, and = forced-circulation-
loop tests. The results obtained to date indicate
that it will be possible to use beryllium unclad
in the CFRE if the temperature of the sodium.
beryllium-inconel region (that is, the reflector and
the island) is kept below 1200°F. The main effect
observed thus far in the tests has been the type
of mass transfer usually found when dissimilar
metals are used in a system. In this case the
mass transfer has been evidenced by the alloying
of beryllium with the Inconel walls in regions
where the beryllium and Inconel were close to-
gether, with only stagnant sodium separating them.

Beryllivm-lnconel-Sodium Compatibility Tests

E. E. Hoffman W. H. Cook
C. R. Brooks C. F. Leitten
Metallurgy Division

Nine tests. of the compatibility of beryllium,
sodium, and Inconel in dynamic systems have been
completed (Table 2.7). in the whirligig tests a
circular loop of Inconel tubing with a beryllium
insert was partly filled with sodium which was
circulated af ‘a velocity of 10 fps. For four of

 

these tests there was no temperature differential,
but for one test there was a differential of 140°F.
These tests were of 300-hr duration. Two thermai-
convection loops of Inconel with beryllium inserts
were tested for 1000 hr with sodium circulating
at a relatively low velocity (approximately 2 to
10 fpm). In addition, seesaw tests were performed
in which beryllium specimens were retained in the
hot zones of oscillating Inconel tubes partly filled
with sodium which circulated ot a velocity of

3 fpm.

Macroscopic examination failed to show attack
on the Inconel, but two specimens showed de-
posits. Black layers were formed in the annular
space between the beryllium insert and the en-
closing Inconel sleeve in the whirligig and thermal-
convection-loop tests. The layer was very ad-
herent and made removal of the insert difficult;
consequently, the weight change data obtained
were not considered as being reliable.

A picture of this layer from a whirligig loop
operated at 1300°F is shown in Fig. 2.5. Micro-
scopic examination showed that the maximum depth
of attack on the inside surface of the Inconel did
not exceed 0.5 mil. Chemical analysis of the
sodium bath reveaied less than 0.04% beryllium
in the sodium. In all tests, beryllium was detected

lines very similar to sodium bicarbonate. The
beryllium specimens from the seesaw tests were

been identified by x-ray onalysis as beryllium
oxide and beryllium, Again, lines similar to

A test unit!? for investigating mass transfer of
beryllium to Inconel in flowing sodium was oper-
ated for 1006 hr under conditions nearly the same
as those proposed for the reflector-moderated re-
actor, The approximate conditions of operation,
with minor fluctuations, were as follows: sodium
flow rate, 3 gpm; beryllium temperature, 1200°F;
maximum temperature, 1245°F (sodium entering
economizer); minimum flowing sodium temperature,
900° F (re-entering economizer from cooling sec-
tion); Reynolds number at minor diameter (0.25 in.)

Upon termination of the test, the unit was cooled
rapidly to room temperature to freeze the sodium.
Samples of both the sodium and the Inconel were
then taken from each of 24 locations in the unit,

3. EXPERIMENTAL REACTOR ENGINEERING
H. W. Savage

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

The emphasis in the engineering work has shifted
to research and component development for the
CFRE and for in-pile loops, since most of the
preoperational ARE tests have been completed.
Two types of pumps have been developed for in-
pile loop use. The vertical-shaft centrifugal sump
pump, which would be installed outside the reactor
shield and thus would require auxiliary shielding,
is now being fabricated in sufficient quantity to
meet the demands of the in-pile loop program and
the forced-circulation corrosion testing program.
The small (4-in.-OD), airedriven, horizontal-shaft
sump pump being developed for insertion in a
reactor beam hole was tested with NaF-ZiF, at
1350°F. Some difficulty was encountered with
initial priming, but operation was otherwise satis
factory. A new, small pump that has the required
small holdup volume is being designed. This
pump, which will use a turbine-type impeller, has
the advantage that both the inlet and discharge
can be at the bottom. Hydraulic drive motors of
suitably small dimensions have been found to be
satisfactory drives for these pumps.

Additional work has been done on the development
of forced-circulation corrosion-testing loops for
obtaining information on the corrosion of Inconel
in high-velocity turbulent fluoride mixtures with
large temperature differentials in the system. Two
series of loops are being constructed to meet the
following requirements: a Reynolds number of
10,000 with temperature gradients of 100, 200, and
300°F and a temperature gradient of 200°F with
Reynolds numbers of 800, 3,000, and 15,000. The
maximum fluid temperature is to be 1500°F., A
forced-circulation loop is also being developed for
testing combinations of structural metals in contact
with high-velocity turbulent liquid metals under
high temperature differentials,

Several exploratory tests were made of gas
burners for use with the proposed gas-furnace heat
source for high-temperature reactor mockup tests.
Also, a study is under way of the cavitation phe-
nomenon associated with operating liquid metal
systems at elevated temperatures, high flow rates,

INGPILE LOOP COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT

W. B. McDonald

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

An in-pile loop for insertion in the MTR is to be
designed, constructed, and operated as a joint
ORNL and Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Division
project. The loop is being developed for circu-
lating proposed fuel mixtures so that the extent
of radiation damage fo materials of construction and
the effect of radiation on the fuel can be de-
termined. Preliminary ORNL work on this project
is concerned with the design and development of
components of a loop to operate in a horizontal
beam hole. Further developmental work was also
done on the vertical-shaft centrifugal pump for use
with both in-pile and out-of-pile forced-circu-
lation loops.

Horizontal-Shaft Sump Pump
D. F. Salmon J. A. Conlin

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

The airedriven horizontaleshaft sump pump de-
scribed previously! was operated with NaF-ZrF ,
at 1350°F. | produced a 70-psi head at 6000 rpm
and a flow rate of 1.5 gpm. Initial difficulty in
priming the pump was solved by momentarily
flooding the impeller labyrinth. This pump, which
was built as a pilot model for checking design
principles, hot pump performance, and reliability,
has too large a volume holdup for in-pile use and
will now be used as a laboratory pump.

A new pump has been designed that has the
required small pump holdup volume. For priming,
this design incorporates a baffle in the sump tank
that will permit remote, momentary flooding of the
impeller eye and the labyrinth behind the impeller.
A turbine-type impeller is used instead of the
conventional centrifugal impeller.

{t has been experimentally determined, with
water, that the turbine type of impeller will prime
itself if the inlet and outlet are placed at the
bottom of the pump and the fluid is maintained at
a level about half way between the bottom of the

fluid leaking past the labyrinth seal. Excessive
impeller end clearances are necessary for this
type of pump because of the severe temperature
gradients present, However, estimated available
pump heads (25 ft at 4500 rpm and 1.5 gpm) are
greater than the estimated requirements. Hydraulic
efficiency of the pump will be low but performance
will be reliable.

Further work has been done on centrifugally
sealed and frozen-fluoride-sealed pumps, and it
has been established that the centrifugally sealed
pump requires too great a volume of fluid for sealing
for it to be considered for in-pile use and that the
leakage rate of the frozen-fluoride-sealed pump is
excessive. However, the centrifugally sealed
pump, which will be useful for other applications,
has been modified to include a system that makes
the pump self-priming and deaerating. By con-
trolling the seal level and using a proper venting

sequence, the pump can be easily stopped and
restarted. A pilot model of the pump, similar to
the pump previously described,? has been designed
that incorporates these features (Fig. 3.1) and an
integral sump tank connected by a passage to the
seal cavity.

In operation, the system would be filled tc the
full level. The seal cavity and sump tank would
then be pressurized through the gas inlet tube to
the predetermined pressure necessary to obtain a
positive pump inlet pressure during operation, and
the pump would be started. The centrifugal force
would cause the liquid in the seal cavity to form a
rotating annulus. The annulus of fluid would
develop a small pressure and thus pump fluid into
the discharge tube, through the loop, and back to
the pump. The small bleed hole from the pump
discharge to the sump tank would permit deaeration
by bypussing aerated fluid from the pump into the
sump. The bypassed fluid would be replaced by
clear fluid from the seal. When the pump was
primed and deaerated, a continuous flow of fluid
would pass from the bleed hole to the sump to
remove any accumulation of gas. Throughout this
operation, fluid entering the loop from the seal to
either fill the loop or replace the bleed flow would
be replaced by fluid from the sump, and sufficient
fluid would thus be in the seal for sealing, There-
fore there is a lower limit on the run level in the

times to provide the necessary flow into the seal.

To stop the unit, the sump tank would be vented
at the same time the pump was stopped, but the
gas pressure would be maintained until draining
had been completed. This would cause a flow of
gas along the shaft into the seal cavity and would
blow out any fluid that might enter along the shaft.
It would also maintain a seal cavity pressure
somewhat greater than the sump tank pressure and
would force the fluid out of the seal into the sump.
If this procedure were not followed, the sealing
annulus of fluid would, upon collapsing when the
pump was stopped, momentarily fill the seal cavity
above the shaft leve! and cause fluid to enter

Vertical-Shaft Centrifugal Sump Pump
D. R. Ward

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

Developmental work has been continued on the
vertical-shaft centrifugal sump pump (Model LFB)
for use with forced-circulation loops, both in-pile
and out. This is a vertical-shoft centrifugal sump
pump with a side inlet and a bottom discharge
(Fig. 3.2). A Graphitar face seal prevents the
pressurizing gas from escaping along the shaft.
Circulating spindle oil serves to lubricate this
face seal and to carry away heat from the seal
region.

Typical performance curves for this pump with
water are shown in Fig. 3.3. In o recent test the
pump was run for 864 hr at 6000 rpm while pumping
1400°F sodium at about 3 gpm. Typical oil leakage
past the shaft face seal was under 0.1 em3/hr.

Developmental work during the past eight months
has resulted in the following improvements in this
pump: the elimination of the tendency for the pump
to introduce gas into the liquid stream at flow
rates up to 6 gpm; an improved anti-flowback seal
to prevent recirculation of the liquid within the
pump; an improved means for cooling the face-seal
region of the pump; and a reduction of pump volume,
which is desirable when the pump is used for
in-pile loop tests.

The main difficulty, that of gas entrainment, was
primarily caused by vortexing and the passage’ of
gas downward along the rotating shaft. The ad-

dition of vertical baffles adjacent to the shaft
merely broke up the large vortex into several
smaller ones, which were just as objectionable.
The problem is solved in the present arrangement
by permitting liquid from the high-pressure region
of the pump to be bypassed up through a hole in
the shaft to an annular space surrounding the
shaft, This liquid, in turn, forms a seal and
prevents the gas from following its former path.

Acceptance tests for these pumps include oper
ating each pump with water to check the pumping
characteristics and freedom from gas entrainment
and pumping sodium at 1400°F for 72 hr at 6000
rpm with acceptable oil leakage past the face seal.
This hot test also serves to clean oxide film from
the wetted pump parts, as well as to reveal any
mechanical faults that might be present. Five of
these pumps are being built, and four similar
pumps (Model LFA) are now in use.

Hydraulic Motor Pump Drives
J. A. Conlin

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

Two types of hydraulic motors have been found
to be suitable for use as in-pile pump drives. The
first, a gear-type motor rated at 1.75 shp at 3500
rpm, was operated at 6000 rpm for 500 hr under a
light load (about 0.08 shp) that was obtained by
coupling the motor to a small air blower. Upon
completion of the test the motor was disassembled
and was found to be in good condition. The rubber
lip shoft seal had worn a slight groove in the
shaft, and a carbon-like deposit which had ac-
cumulated on the shaft just outside the seal caused
the seal to stick slightly after it had been idle for
a prolonged period. However, throughout the test,
seal leckage was negligible. The only other indi-
cation of wear was a slight scoring on the gear
sides adjocent to the shaft end of the motor.

The second motor, an axial-piston type rated at
3.8 shp at 6060 rpm continuous duty, was run for
100 hr at 6000 rpm. Operation was completely
satisfactory, and, since this motor is rated at
6060 (pm, further testing was judged to be un-
necessary.

The axialepiston motor was chosen for in-pile
service, since it is considered to be the more
reliable unit. Throughout these tests, hydraulic
oil with a viscosity of 155 SSU (seconds Saybolt
universal) at 100°F and a viscosity index of 100
It should be noted that during initial
testing of the gear-type mator, oil with a viscosity
of 290 to 325 SSU at 100°F was used, and, as a
result, excessive overheating of the motor occurred
to the extent that the shaft turned blue. Despite
this, the motor completed the test satisfactorily.

The previously described, small, Inconel, forced-
circulation loop designed to have a temperature
differential of 135°F has been operated for a total
of 141 hr with NaF.ZrF UF, (50-46-4 mole %)
at ain apparent mass flow rate of 400 to 450 Btu/hr
with a temperature differential up to 300°F.% The

fluid velocity in the loop normally was maintained
at about 1.7 fps at a temperature gradient of 165°F,
Termination of the test resulted from a short in
the motor leads and subsequent rupture of the
heated section of the loop. The test facility,
shown in Fig. 3.4, is being rebuilt and is approxi-
mately 80% complete. The final design conditions
are presented in Fig. 3.5. Reports which give a
detailed presentation of the design and an analysis
of the initial operation are being prepared. ?s3

In the design of the loop for electrical-resistance
heating, a resistivity value® of 98 pohm-cm was
used for Inconel in computing the necessary length
of the resistonce-heated tube. However, data
obtained during the loop operation indicated that
the actual resistivity of the Inconel was about
70 to 80 pohm-cin. To resolve the discrepancy, a
duplicate of the heating section of the loop wos
filled with NaF-ZrF UF, (50-46-4 mole %) and
alternately heated ond cooled while accurate
potential ond current measurements were made.
Sixty-two measurements were made in the tempera-
ture range of 800 to 1600°F, and the average
resistivity of the Inconel was found to be 75
pohme-cm.

A program is under way for the design, con-
struction, and operation of two series of forcad-
circulation loops for studying the effect of temper-
ature gradient ond fluid velocity on the phenomenon
of mass transfer in Inconel systems containing
fluoride mixtures at elevated temperatures.” The
requirements of the two series of loops are a
Reynolds number of 10,000 with temperature gradi-
ents of 100, 200, and 300°F and ¢ temperature
gradient of 200°F ond Reynolds numbers of 800,
3,000, and 15,000. The maximum fluid temperature
is specified as 1500°F, and the Reynolds numbers
are to be evaluated at that temperature. The loops
are to be constructed of Inconel tubing. The
maximum tube-wall temperature is to be 1700°F,
and the surfuce-to-volume ratio is to be held

A summary of the design dimensions and expected
operating conditions for each of the six loops is
presented in Table 3.1, which also indicates the
current status of each loop. Three methods of
heating were studied: electrical-resistance, gas-
fired furnace, and liquid bath. The liquid bath
was discounted because it would require pres-
surization of the liquid metal, an excessively long
heat exchanger,and a large investment. A gas-
fired furnace was considered, but lack of operating
experience and the high heat flux necessary for
the loops indicated the use of electrical heating,
with which considerable experience has been ob-
tained. A gas-fired furnace is being studied as a
possible heat source for a large number of cor-
rosion loops. Preliminary calculations of the

A loop for testing combinations of structural
metals in contact with high-velocity turbulent
liquid metals under high temperature differentials
is being developed. If combinations of materials
are found that are satisfactory for use in liquid
metal systems, greater flexibility and ease of
construction may be attained. An optimized design,
patterned after that used for beryllium-Inconel-
sodium mass transfer tests (cf. Sec. 2, “Reflector
Moderated Reactor’’), has been developed and is
to be used first for testing combinations of Inconel
and type 316 stainless steel in sodium.

GAS-FURNACE HEAT-SOURCE DEVELOPMENT

L. A. Mann
Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

L. F. Roy'!
University of Mississippi

Several exploratory tests were made of com-
mercial and ORNL-designed-and-fabricated burners
for use with the gas-furnace heat source described
previously.'? The heat release intensity desired

is on the order of 3000 Btu/ft%.sec, which is of the
same order as that attained in jet aircraft burners.

The maximum rate of heat release obtained in
the tests, 170 Btu/ft3, was obtained with the
burner designed by A. P. Fraas. The results of
these exploratory tests are presented in Table 3.2.
Although the rate of heat release contemplated in
the original design (about 3000 Btu/ft3.sec) was
not approached in these tests, it appears that
rates higher than 170 Btu/ft®.sec can be attained
by securing more rapid mixing of air and gas,
preheating the combustion-air, and providing a
positive pressure in the combustion chamber.
Additional tests are to be made.

on the cavitation phenomenon in forced-circulation
high-temperature sodium systems, a preliminary
study was initiated.

Tests were run on the ARE hot pump test facility
in which pressures at the venturi throat could be
varied by varying the pressure of the blanketing
gas. Thus it was possible to vary the pressures
without changing the pump speed, the throttle
valve setting, or the temperature. Data were taken
during eight runs at temperatures in the range
1200 to 1500°F. Measurements were made of pump
discharge pressure, venturi throat pressure, and
pump suction pressure as the pump suction pres-
sure was varied. Cavitation was found to begin
when the venturi throat pressure ceased to decrease
uniformly with decreasing pump suction pressure.
Also, as cavitation began, the loop pressure drop
increased and the flow rate decreased. Observation
of fluid flow noise revealed a correlation of noise
intensity with pressure data,

The pressure at which cavitation occurred cannot
be exactly ascertained, since the pressure at the
middle of the throat of the venturi is obviously
not the lowest pressure in the venturi. In water
cavitation, bubbles form at the start of the flow
expansion, and, in the particular venturi used, the
rather sharp radius at the transition from the throat
to the diffusion cone probably caused flow sepo-

of 20 to 1.6 psia, with the sodium-filled transmitter
maintained at about 650°F. The zero shift of the

Hg over the range.

A second check of the zero shift was made as
the transmitter temperature was varied from 800 to

mately 16.2 psi. The zero shift then observed was
+0.1 to -0.2 in, Hg. In general, the performance
of this pressure-measuring device was quite satis-

The number of power panels installed for sup-

in place from test to test may possibly be used.
The possibilities of automatizing operation of the
loops and of providing safeguards in case of
shutdowns because of power failures or other
emergencies are also being studied. The loops
have been redesigned so that they require fewer
welds, and the sharp angles of liquid flow have
been eliminated. Figure 3.6 shows the old and

The first step of the present critical experiment
program was the construction of a small two-region
reflector-moderated reactor to provide experimental
data on a system of simple geometry and materials
for use in checking the present calculational
methods.! The assembly is approximately spheri-
cal, 41 in. in outside diameter, and has a center, or
core region, that is about 15 in. in diameter.? The
core consists of alternate sheets of enriched
uranium metal (4 mils thick) and Teflon, (CF,),,
and is surrounded by a beryllium reflector. It is
possible to vary the uranium loading, within the
specified dimensions, in order to make the system
critical. The Teflon and the uranium have been cut
to the various shapes necessary to form the sub-
assemblies required to conveniently construct the
core. A summary of the materials in the first criti-
cal assembly is given in Table 4.1. The aluminum,
which is a necessary structural material, is present
in the core as a vertical double sheet at the mid-
plane and in the reflector as fairly well-distributed
sheets and rods. The coating material, which con-
tained 31.8 wt % C, 61.9 wt % F, 5.5 wt % Cr, and
0.83 wt % H, was applied in a thin layer to the
uranium metal to reduce oxidation. The Scotch
cellophane tape was used to hold the core sub-
assemblies together. A view of the mid-plane of
the reactor as initially assembled is shown in Fig.
4.1. The small rectangular holes below and to the
right of the core are the aluminum guide channels
for the control and safety rods.

An earlier assembly was loaded with 17.4 Ib of
U233%, as prescribed by the multigroup calculations,
and was not critical. It was discovered, however,
that these calculations were in error because of
a numerical error in one of the cross sections and
that the predicted critical mass range should have
been 20.9 to 22.75 Ib of U?35, The system was
made critical with 24.35 Ib of U?3% and had an
excess reactivity of approximately 7 cents, with
about 20% of the mid-plane aluminum plates omitted.
It has since been shown that the mounting of this
plate resulted in a reduction in reactivity of ap-
proximately 10 cents, and therefore the system as
designed and loaded with 24.35 Ib was slightly
subcritical. Sufficient excess reactivity for sub-
sequent experiments has been gained by the addi-
tion of a cylindrical annulus of beryllium reflector
17%, in. long and 2% in, wide with its axis perpen-
dicular to the mid-plane. This addition gave an
increase in reactivity of 65 cents. The extra
beryllium at the top of the reactor was removed
during flux measurements.

radius that was used for the indium flux measure-

fragments retained in aluminum foils placed in
contact with uranium. Similar data, presented in
Fig. 4.3, were obtained with the uranium and alumi-
num enclosed in cadmium covers. The average
uranium-cadmium fraction for the core is 0.33. The
fission rates were measured on opposite sides of
three uranium foils near the reflector, and the
results are plotted. In each case the rate was
higher on the side toward the beryllium.

Upon completion of the experiments on this as-

of the same shape that will consist of three regions,
with the beryllium island and reflector separated
by the fuel annulus. The diameters of the beryllium
island and the fuel annulus will be about 10.4 and
20 in., respectively. Initially, the assembly will
have no structural materials, such as Inconel core

tained in stainless steel tubes distributed in on
organic liquid in a pattern designed to give a uni-
form radial thermal-neutron flux, The liquid, Furfural
(C4H,0,), which dlso serves as a neutron reflector
on the lateral surface of the cylindrical tube bundle,
has a hydrogen density gpproximately the same as
that of water under the temperature and pressure
conditions designed for the SCWR. It simulates
the nuclear properties of supercritical water as
well as can be determined without further knowledge
of the effect of binding energies on diffusion and
slowing down lengths, Stainless steel was inserted
in the fuel tubes to represent the reactor structure.

The loading of the critical assembly was calcu-
lated by Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Division person-
nel, by use of a four-group diffusion theory method,
to be 15.34 kg of U?35 and 261 kg of stainless
steel in o 76.2-cm equilateral right cylinder with a

fuel distribution is plotted in Fig. 4.4 as the smooth
curve and is compared fo the stepwise distribution
achieved when all tubes are identically loaded,

In the experimental study, a quantity of UQ,F,
aqueous solution, containing uranium enriched to
93.14% in U?3%, was distributed among the tubes
at a U23% concentration of 0.505 g/cm®. The
number of tubes required for criticality was meas-
sured as a function of the Furfural height as in-
creasing quantities of stainless steel were inserted
ond as the solution was diluted. In this manner o
stepwise approach was made to a loading of uniform

concentration which would be critical at the de-
signed linear dimensions of both fuel solution and
Furfural and which would contain the prescribed
mass of stainless steel. These conditions have
not been achieved because the last dilution was
overestimated and a large part of the solution is at
a concentration somewhat lower than required for
criticality, a deficiency compensated for by locating
about 50 tubes of higher concentration fuel in one
peripheral section.

Studies of the NaF-ZrF UF, system were initi-
ated after the solid phase studies in the NaF-ZrF ,
system were completed, ond fo date no ternary com-
pounds have been discovered in the NaF-ZeF ,-UF,
system. A tentative equilibrium diagram has been
prepared. The apparatus for visual observation of
melting temperatures was used fo observe eleven
NaF-UF, mixtures in the composition range 20 to
50 mole % UF ,, and a partial phase diagram of the
system was prepared. A new apparatus has been
constructed that will permit some manipulations to
be carried out with the fused salts in an inert
atmosphere.

Recent attempts to correlate the anticipated re-
duction of UF, in the preparation of UF ;-bearing
melts with wet chemical analysis for UF, and UF,
and results of petrographic examination show some
surprising anomalies. When UF, dissolved in LiF,
in NaF-ZrF , mixtures, or in NaF-LiF mixtures is
treated under flowing hydrogen at 800°C with ex-
cess uranium metal, 90% or more of the UF, is
reduced to UF,. However, when this technique is
applied to UF, in NaF-KF-LiF mixtures, the re-
duction is only 50% complete at 800°C and, perhaps,
75% complete at 600°C, Petrographic examinations
of the specimens reveal no complex compounds of
tetravalent uranium; it is possible that the UF

in molten NaZrF ave been re-examined by the use
of various ratios of UF,/UF , with chromium metal

in the charge, From the data obtained when this

initial ratio is less than 3, average values of
5 x 10=4 at 600°C and 6 x 10-4 at 800°C can be
computed. At ratios larger than 3 the values in-
crease regularly; this rise is probably due to the
extreme difficulty in filtration ond analysis of
samples containing 1 to 20 ppm of Cr**. The
values at low UF,/UF, ratios agree quite well
with the corresponding values of 4.2 x 10% at
600°C and 4.1 x 10~4 at 800°C obtained previously
when UF, and chromium metal were the charge
material.

Fundamental studies were made of the reduction
of NiF, and FeF, by H, in NaF-ZrF, systems as
a means of determining possible improvements in
purification techniques, Also, methods for pre-
metal fluorides
studied. Additional measurements of decomposition

placed with o nickel and glass combination, and
measurements of xenon solubility in molten fluo-

Large quantities of purified ZrF ;-base fluorides

Since the consumption of NaF-ZrF, and NaF-

during the fiscal year, it is important to decrease
the cost of production of this material. The HF-H,
processing currently used is adequate from all
points of view, but processing times of nearly
100 hr per batch are now required with the reia-
tively poor raw materials available. The sub-

proposed use of zirconium metal as a scavenger (to
replace most of the hydrogen processing) has shown
promise on a small scale, and rapid electrolytic
deposition of iron and nickel from the ZrF -base

that the price of purified NaZrF and NaF-ZrF ,-UF

mixtures moy be halved in the next few months,

ture (890°C) at the zirconium compound and the low
liquidus temperature (629°C) at the uranium com-
pound. In order to study equilibrium relationships
in the region between these two solid solution joins,
a series of nine compositions equally spaced along
the Na, Zr -Na UF. join was prepared, Phase
analyses on completely crystallized preparations
of these compositions indicate that Na,Z¢F, and
Na,UF, do not exist in equilibrium with each other
and with liquid. Instead, the join between Na, ZrF
and Na, UF. crosses the two three-phase triangles
having their common base on the Mag ZeF,-NagU Foy
line and their opexes at Na,ZrF, and Na,UF.
Quenching experiments are being made for estab-
lishing liquidus relationships and boundary curves
in this area.

Four ternary mixtures were prepared in order to
obtain a preliminary indication of equilibrium relo-
tionships in other parts of the system. The com-
positions of these mixtures are given in Table 5.1.
Identification, by x-ray diffraction and petrographic
techniques, of the phases in completely crystal-
lized preparations of the mixtures indicated that the
compound Na Zr, Fo occupies a small primary
phase area contiguous to the primary phase fields
of the NagZr FF, -NajUF,, and the Zr UF,

course of the visual observations, were generally
a little higher than those indicated by the published
diagram for this system.! The data are shown on
the partial phase diagram for the NaF-UF, system
in Fig, 5.2. A solid circle indicates the tempera-
ture at which the composition appeared to be com-
pletely solidified. This point could not be de-
termined with any degree of certainty with some
compositions, and the disappearance of the liquid
phase was not always accompanied by a noticeable
thermal effect, The liquidus temperatures shown in
Fig. 5.2 seem fo indicate that Na UF, melts con-
gruently at 629°C, thai is, at a temperature only a
few degrees higher than the eutectic temperatures
on both sides of the compound. The data also
support the results of petrographic studies which
indicate that the compound in the 50 mole % UF,
region has the approximate composition NagU F ,;
rather than NaUF .,

It was assumed in the previous studies? of solu-
bility relationships for UF; in various fluoride
mixtures that in the presence of excess metallic
uranium or zirconium the uranium present in the
fused salt solution was trivalent, This assumption
seemed justified, since, for the reaction

BUF, + hue — UF, ,

Brewer's tabulation? of standard free energies of
formation yields

AF® = -16 keal .

In addition, petrographic exomination of the melts
obtained revealed the presence of red materials
tentatively identified as complex compounds of
UF,, with green compounds of UF, showing only
in traces, if at all. Since these observations were
those anticipated and since the petrographic ex-
aminations had previously been shown to be very
sensitive in detecting compounds of trivalent ura-
nium in systems which had been slightly reduced,
there seemed to be little reason to believe that the
results of such examination might be unreliable.

During the past quarter, however, considerable evi-
dence has been accumulated by the most accurate
wet-chemical methods yet devised for determining
U3" and U*" in fluoride mixtures which shows
that the reduction of UF, by excess uranium metal
is not complete at 800°C. While the reduction in

NaF-ZrF , mixtures and in LiF appears to be 90%,
or more, complete, in such mixtures as NaF-KF-LiF
only about 50% of the UF is reduced. Toward the
end of the quarter it became evident that severdl
of the materials such as "3KF-2UF," previously
believed to contain only U3? regularly contained
large and varying quantities of U*Y, Furthermore,
the crystals containing variable quantities of U4Y
ore distinguishable as such only with great diffi-
culty, if at all, by petrographic and x-ray diffraction
examination, Consequently, the previously reported
data on the solubility of UF, in various systems
must be reinterpreted.

The reasons for the incomplete reduction of the
tetravalent uranium are not yet completely under-
stood, and it is not possible at present to define
the extent to which the reduction will proceed at
various temperatures and in the various solvents,
Accordingly, the significance of much of the ma-
terial presented below is not completely known,

UF, in ZrF ;-Bearing Systems

The solubility of UF, in NaF-ZrF, mixtures was
previously shown? to increase with increasing
temperature and with increasing ZF, concentration
of the solvent over the range 47 to 57 mole % Z¢F ,.
Since the publication of that information it has been
shown that the reduction of UF, in ZrF -bearing
melts by excess uranium metal is slightly less than
90% complete at 800°C, The temperature de-
pendence of the reduction is not yet known for
this system, but it is likely that the UF, is more
completely reduced at lower temperatures,

An examination of the NaF-ZrF -UF; system has
been aoftempted by thermal analysis, with petro-
graphic examination of the resulting solid phases.
In these studies, UF, and excess uranium metal
are added to the desired NaF-ZrF, mixture before
the sample is heated, and the somple is stirred
constantly while in the molten state. Therefore
the reaction

UF, + JU°+== UF,

might be expected to reach its equilibrium value of
any temperature above the melting point, Conse-
quently, in contrast fo experiments in which the
metallic uranium is removed by filtration at high
temperatures, the solid products in slowly cooled
melts might be expected to be nearly completely
reduced.

These studies indicate that UF; is the primary
phase in systems in which the NoF-to-ZrF | ratio is

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1954

less than 5 to 6 and that Na UF, appears as the
primary phase in systems in which the NaF-to-ZrF
ratio is about 15. It also appears that Na, Zr F
crystals may contain small quantities of UF in
solid solution. The solubility data obtained from
these and previous studies give little reason to
expect that UF, con be dissolved in NaoF-ZrF,
mixtures in sufficient amounts to provide fuel for
reflector-moderated reactors.

UF, in NaF-KF-LiF Mixtures
The solubility of UF, in the NaF-KF-LiF eutectic

was stated previously!? to be equivalent to at
least 15 wt % at temperatures as low as 525°C,
Subsequent careful examination of this system has
revealed that when UF, and an excess of uranium
metal are added to the purified NaF-KF-LiF mixture
the dissolved uranium species aggregate at least
22% total uranium in the mixture. However, it is
obvious that only 40 to 45% of the soluble uranium
is present as UF; at 800°C, while 55 to 60% may be
trivalent at 600°C, Further study of the system will
be necessary before these values can be determined
more accurately,

Thermal analysis data have been obtained for
several mixtures which were prepared from UF; and
the NaF-KF-LiF eutectic and then treated with an
excess of uranium metal. The data obtained, as
shown in Table 5.2, are in agreement with the data
obtained from filtration studies which showed high
uranium concentrations at low temperatures. Petro-
graphic examination of these materials revealed that
at low uranium concentrations a red phase (refractive
index, about 1.44), which is probably K UF, ond
which may contain UF, is predominant. At high

(refractive index, 1.544) also appear. There is
evidence that the blue material is a solid solution
of Na U,Fo-K U Fg; whether it dissolves UF, is
not known.

UF, in NaF-RbF.LiF Mixtures

The previously reported! data on the solubility
of UF, in the NaF-RbF-LiF eutectic composition
were based on the assumption that all the uranium
in the filtered specimens was UF. For more.recent
studies, the solubilities were determined by using
200-g samples of melt, mechanical agitation during
the equilibration period, and 20% excess uranium
for the reduction step. Samples of the equilibrium
mixture were withdrawn with a filter stick contain-
ing sintered nickel as the filter medium. The
samples were then analyzed for trivalent uranium
and for total uranium. The results of the analyses
are presented in Table 5.3.

TR. J. Sheil and C. J. Barton, ANP Quar. Prog. Rep.
June 10, 1954, ORNL-1729, p 53,

The significance of the analyses for UF, is not
entirely clear. Petrographic examination of the
solidified filtrates indicated a reddish-brown ma-
terial, presumed to be Rb,UF , as the only colored
phase, While it is possible that this material could
accommodate UF, in solid solution, it does not
appear likely that as much as 75% of the total
uranium present could be hidden in this fashion,

The good agreement, for some of the mixtures
studied, between the theoretical uranium content
and the measured total uranium content indicates
that the reaction of UF, with uranium metal pro-
ceeded nearly to completion. Additional data on
this system will be needed before an interpretation
of the results can be presented.

UF 5 in the Individual Alkali-Metal Fluorides

Filtered specimens from preparations in which
UF, dissolved in LiF was treated at 825 to 850°C
with excess uranium metal have shown that more
than 90% of the dissolved uranium is trivalent and
that it crystallizes as UF, Accordingly, it is
believed that the behavior observed by thermal
analysis of this system is that of LiF with pure,

obtained by reducing NaF-UF, mixtures with ex-
cess uranium in open crucibles protected by an
atmosphere of helium. Some data, also obtained
during the past quarter, were obtained by a method
which represents a compromise between the two
previously mentioned methods, Mixtures were pre-
pared in open stirrer-equipped crucibles by combin-
ing dry NaF with freshly prepared!” UF. These
data are indicated in Fig. 5.4 by the solid triangles.
The agreement between the data obtained by the
various methods is considered to be gratifying, in
view of the difficulties associated with the ease of
oxidation of U3* to U4*, The identification of the
compound is based chiefly upon the results of
petrographic examination of slowly cooled melts.
The possibility that the compound might be Na, UF,
rather than Na,U,F, and the possibility that
appreciable quantities of UF, may be “hidden’’ in
these materials have not been completely ruled out
by these studies. Very few compositions contain-
ing more than 50 mole % UF; have been prepared,
and the data in this part of the system are probably
of little value,

seems that in both systems considerable UF, is
present along with the UF, in a manner such that
it can escape detection by petrographic examination,

UF, in Binary Alkali-Metal Fluoride Systems

A number of thermal analyses followed by peiro-
graphic examination of the solid products have
been performed with UF, in each of the NaF-LiF,
NaF-KF, and LiF-KF eutectic mixtures. These
specimens were prepared, in each case, by reducing
the desired UF ;~alkali-metal fluoride mixture with
10% excess metallic uranium in nickel crucibles
blanketed with inert gas and fitted with stirrers of
nickel,

In the NaF-LiF system the lowest liquidus tem-
perature observed was at about 630°C at 10 mole %
UF; and 36 mole % NaF. In all cases studied (up
to 30 mole % UF ;) only the free alkali-metal fluo-
rides and the NaF-UF ; complex compound (Na3U, Fg)
were observed.

In the NaF-KF-UF, system the red compound
K3UF, appears as the only colored species in
mixtures containing up to 10 mole % UF,; the
optical properties are slightly different from those
of the compound crystallized fromNaF-free mixiures
and may indicate slight solid solution of NaF in
the crystals. Mixtures containing 20 to 40 mole %
UF, show increasing quantities of a blue phase
with optical properties which suggest that it is a
solid solution of NajU Fg and KjU,t,. Liquidus
temperatures in this system seem to be higher than
700°C in all cases.

Solutions of UF, in the LiF-KF binary system
show liquidus temperatures in the range 485 to
600°C, Petrographic examination of thesematerials
shows free Lif in all specimens, K UF, in those
containing less than 10 mole % UF,, and K,U, Fg
in those containing much above 10 mole % UF.

Chemical analyses were not performed on any of
these materials, but it is likely thot considerable
UF, was present in these specimens, especially at

PURIFICATION OF RUBIDIUM FLUORIDE

C. J. Barton, Materials Chemistry Division
D. L.. Stockton, ORSORT

All the rubidium fluoride obtained from commercial
suppliers to date has contained considerably more
than the specified quantity of cesium compounds,
and therefore almost ail of it has been retuned to

60

the vendors for further processing. However, the
immediate need for small amounts of pure material
for phase equilibrium studies and for rubidium metal
production has necessitated purification of some
material at ORNL.

Experiments '® have shown the feasibility of
separating rubidium from cesium with the ion ex-
change medium Amberlite IR-105, This resin was,
accordingly, used in all the experiments conducted.
The resin column consisted of a 3-in.-dia glass
pipe containing a 6-ft bed of the resin. The column
was loaded for each run with about 350 g of crude
RbF known to contain about 20% CsF. Elution of
the rubidium was accomplished in about 35 liters of
0.5 M (NH ,) ,CO,4 solution; the purity of the product
was not appreciably affected by elution rates in
the range 30 to 60 ml/min.

Elution of cesium from the column, which was
observed by use of Cs'37, required 65 to 70 liters
of the (NH,),CO, solution; elution was not greatly
improved by use of a 1.5 M solution. From a total
of 1775 g of crude RbF charged in five different
runs, somewhat more than 1 kg of RbF containing
less than 1% CsF was obtained. The KF content
(0.6% KF) was not appreciably affected by this
treatment. lt is apparent that this purification can
be conducted on a large scale at reasonable cost if
material sufficiently free from cesium cannot be
obtained from commercial sources.

been checked with various ratios of UF, to UF, as
starting materials in the NaZrF; solution. The
apparatus and details of the experimental technique
were the same as in previous experiments. The
results of the recent series of experiments in which

It was necessary to calculate the final UF, con.
centration, since accurate analyses for U3" in the
presence of Cr** could not be made; any error
arising from this calculation would be important
only at low UF, concentrations,

The data show that at both 600 and 800°C the

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1954

values of K_ remain constant at low UF ;-to-UF
ratios but increase rapidly as this ratio rises above
3. This rapid increase in K_ may be due to in-
complete removal by filtration of small amounts of
chromium metal or to uncertainties in analysis of
these trace quantities. Since, as shown above, the
UF ;-to-UF , ratio in NaZrF ; solution in equilibrium
with uranium metal is about 9 at 800°C, it is not
likely that disproportionation of the UF, is re-
sponsible for the increase in K_,

In any case, the agreement between the mean of
four values of the constant ot each temperature
with previously published values is extremely good.
Agreement among the various initial UF ;-to-UF,
ratios seems to show that a state of equilibrium is
reached in these experiments.

When equilibrium data for the reaction

Fe® + UF +==2UF, + FeF,

were obtained by the addition of UF, UF, and
FeF, to NaZrF in the same way as for the chro-
mium reaction, the results obtained were not so

Stability of Chromium Compounds in
Molten Fluorides

J. D. Redmon C. F. Weaver
Materials Chemistry Division

It was shown in previous experiments that CrF,
or some complex compound of divalent chromium
was the corrosion product in the ZrF bose fluoride
melts of interest, However, when NoF-KF-LiF
mixtures, with and without UF ,, were tested in
equipment prepared from alloys containing chromium,
the reaction products found were complex com-
pounds of CrF,. Since films that were apparently
NaK,CrF or similar materials have been observed
in some experiments, attempts have been made to
observe the stability ond solubility of GrF, and
CrF, in typical salt mixtures of the two types.

In the temperature range 600 to 800°C, CF, is
not stable in NaZrF_ solution in contact with

Reduction of NiF, by H, in NaF.ZrF Systems

C. M. Blood H. A. Friedman

Materials Chemistry Division

The use of hydrogen as a reducing agent in the
removal of oxidizing impurities from fluoride melts
has been routine for almost two years. One of the
principal impurities removed is the Ni ** introduced
as a result of treating the melts with hydrogen
fluoride in nickel containers at 800°C, Since
hydrogen was first employed in this fashion, kinetic
studies have been under way in order to supply data
on which improved fluoride production procedures

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1954

could be based, The Ni** was found to reduce so
rapidly thot the controlling step was the rate of
removal of hydrogen fluoride from the melt; hence
the chemistry of the process presents no problem of
consequence from an engineering standpoint. With
the completion of measurements af 800°C during the
past quarter, these studies have been discontinued.

The experimental method used for the measure-
ments at 800°C was the same as that used in
previously described 600 and
700°C.'® Figure 5.5 shows a comparison of the
effect of temperature on the rates of reduction for
four concentrations. The slopes of the curves show
that the apparent activation energy for the rate de-
termining step is about 7800 cal. This energy of
activation is in accord with the hypothesis that
the reaction is heterogeneous ond is catalyzed by
nickel surfaces.

The data presented here were all obtained at
roughly the same gas flow rate (100 ml/min).
However, since the rate of reduction is dependent
on the flow rate and on the geometry of the appa-
ratus, the results must be considered merely as
representative and are subject to some variation
with conditions; they apply to 3-kg batches in

Reduction of FeF, by H, in NaF-ZrF , Systems
C. M. Blood G. M. Watson

Materials Chemistry Division

Since the reduction of Fel, with hydrogen is the
time-consuming step in purification of NaZrF
mixtures for reactor use and testing, an extensive
study of the equilibrium constant of this reaction
has been attempted,

Fel, + H,&==Fe® + 2HF

The reaction

is relatively easy to study, since the hydrogen
fluoride concentration in hydrogen can be accu-
rately determined, and, after filtration of the melt,
accurate determinations of FeF, in the melt can
be obtained. Since at these elevated temperatures
the activities of hydrogen and hydrogen fluoride
can be assumed to be equal to their partial pressures
in the gos phase, then

the activity coefficient for Fel, at low concentra-
tions in NaZrF should be easily determined. The
equilibrium constant for the reaction has been
estimated by two different methods: a dynamic

method and an equilibration method.

The experiments were performed by adding known
quantities of FeF, to an NaF-Zrf, (53-47 mole %)
melt in a clean nickel reactor and measuring the HIF
concentration of the effluent hydrogen passed at
carefully measured flow rates. The cumulative
total of HF removed was also determined by col-
lection of the HF in caustic solution and titration
of the excess caustic. The Fel, concentration at
any specified time could be calculated from the
Fel, found by analysis on completion of the ex-
periment and the HF yield after the specified time.
This procedure, which is simple, rapid, and
capable of high internal precision, yielded the
values plotied as the lower curve in Fig. 5.7. The
logarithm &f the HF concentration is plotted against
the logarithm of the FeF, concentration at various

is probably due to the reaction of HF at its initial

nickel apparatus and its subsequent re-equilibration
with the more dilute HF-H, mixture. The straight-

Equilibration Method. Since it was doubtful that
the lowest flow rate found to be practicable (9
ml/min) actually represented equilibrivin condi-
tions, an attempt was made to determine the equi-
librium conditions directly, A mixture of HF and
H, was bubbled through a melt containing Fe® and
FeF, until the influent HF concentration matched

66

that of the effluent. At that time a sample was
drawn through a sintered nickel filter and analyzed
to determine the FeF, concentration,

Since the decomposition pressures of molten
KF-HF saturated with KF depend only on tempera-
ture, 19 definite mixtures of H, ond HF could be
obtained while hydrogen gas was passed over such
mixtures held at a constant temperature, The
mixtures of H, thus obtained were used as influent
for the reactor containing the salt mixture.

In a typical experiment in which this method was
used, a batch (~3 kg) of previously purified NaF-
Zi, (53-47 mole %) mixture was loaded into a
clean nickel reactor. The mixture was heated to
800°C and further purified with hydrogen until a
very low HF concentration (3 x 10~% mole/liter)
in the effluent gas denoted high purity of the melt.
The mixture was allowed to cool to room tempera-
ture, and FeF, and iron wire were added to the cold,
frozen mixture under an atmosphere of argon. The
mixture was then heated, melted, and brought up to
temperature while it was sparged with helium gas.
The reactor containing the KF-HF or HF generator
was heated separately to a convenient initial
temperature and connected to the system.
hydrogen

Pure
was passed in parallel through both
reactors — the HF generator and the equilibration
reactor — in order to clean out any NiF, films on
walls and to precipitate nickel impurities. After
1 to 2 hr of parallel operation, the reactors were
connected in series, and the inlet and effluent
gas streams were continuously sampled and ano
lyzed. The temperature of the furnace of the
generator was then adjusted until the analyzer
showed H,-HF mixtures of the desired composition.
The gas mixture was allowed to bubble through the
system for extended periods of time, and samples
were taken intermittently for analysis. When it was
considered that the system had approached equi-
librium, as indicated by a convergence of the in-
fluent and effluent compositions, the HF generator
was removed from the system and helium was sub-
stituted for the influent gas mixture. A filtering
tube was introduced into the melt under an addi-
tional argon atmosphere and o filtrate was obtained,
The filtering tube with the frozen filtrate was re-
moved ond analyzed for iron. This procedure was
repeated with appropriate variation of the tempera-
ture of the HF generator and consequent variation
of the influent gas composition,
The data obtained are presented in Table 5.8,
which gives the concentration of iron found in the
filtrate, the ratio of the HF concentrations in the
influent ond effluent gases, and the equilibrium
constants ond corresponding activity coefficients
for the FeF,., As is evident, the data in Table 5.8
are less precise than those obtained by the dynamic
procedure, The lowered precision is probably due
to the more complex apparatus and technique. How-
ever, when the data are plotted (Fig. 5.8), the
spread of the data is less than the estimated un-
certainty in the AF® values. The agreement be-
tween the values obtained by the two methods is
remarkably good.

Preparation of Various Fluorides

The simple structural metal fluorides have con-
tinued to be used extensively for numerous pur-
poses. A limited interest also has been maintained
in several of the complex fluorides formed by the
interaction of alkali fluorides with structural metal
fluorides. Some effort also has been expended on
the preparation of other simple fluorides, as well as
on the purification of small quantities of the struc-
tural metal fluorides. The identity and purity of
these fluorides have been established mainly by
chemical analysis supplemented by x-ray and petro-
graphic data in some cases,

The compound AgF, with an Ag-to-F ratio of

at 150 to 200°C. An attempt to prepare AgF by
reacting HF with AgCN was unsuccessful; most of
the AgCN did not react. Several batches of an-
hydrous ZnF, were prepared by heating ZnF ,-4H,0
under HF at 600°C. The compound TeF, was
prepared by reacting Te and HNO, and reacting the
resulting TeO, with aqueous HF to give TeO,F -H,0,
which was thermally decomposed to yield TeO,,
HF, H,0, ond the product TeF,. The TeF, was
collected in a condenser held at 130 to 140°C,

Small quantities of Rb,CrF , and Li,RbCrF ( were
prepared by heating the proper quantities of CeF
RbF, and LiF in sealed capsules at 900°C. The

The compound RbCrF, was prepared by heating
CrF, and RbF at 800°C in a sealed capsule.
Numerous batches of structural metal fuel- or
coolant-type fluoride complexes were prepared.
Among these (prepared by methods previously
described) were: KyCeFy, K,NiF,, and KNiF,.

The compounds NiF,, FeF,, and FeF, were pre-
pared in a high state of purity by hydrofluorination
of the corresponding chlorides.

Additional measurements of decomposition poten-

Platinum and nickel were used as cathodes, and
the anodes were of nickel, carbon (graphite),
chromium, and zirconium.

The solutions of various chlorides in KCI were
prepared by melting 2 moles of KCl with 1 mole of
the anhydrous chloride in o sealed, evacuated

The NiCl, solutions, as far as is known, undergo
the same electrochemical reactions regardless of
concentration. Thus the changes in decomposition
potential with concentration may be assigned to
differences in NiCl, activity alone. With the aid
of the Nernst equation, the NiCl, activity at 33.3

in the 3.3 mole % solution and 300 times that in
the 1 mole % solution.

Selubility of Xenon in Molten Salts

R. F. Newton, Research Director's Department
D. G. Hill, Consultant

The use of molten salts as reactor fuels offers
the possibility of removing the gaseous fission-
product poisons, of which zenon is the most im-
portant. lf, for example, the xenon concentration of
the 60-Mw CFRE can be held at 10% of its equi-
librium value (1.1 x 10~8 mole of xenon per milli-
liter of fuel), important perturbations in reactivity
can be avoided. In on ocircraft reactor, however,
it will be necessary to effect this removal of xenon
with an absolute minimum of auxiliary equipment,

The available literature appears to contain no
measurements of the solubility of gases in molten
salts, Accordingly, it has seemed desirable to
evaluate the solubility of xenon in molten fluorides
over the temperature range of interest, Preliminary
tests indicate that the following experimental tech-
nique is satisfactory.

The apparatus, which is constructed of nickel
where it will be in contact with the fluoride melt
and of glass elsewhere, consists of two sections
that con be isolated by freezing a plug of fluoride
in the U-tube connecting them, In one section of
the apparatus the melt is allowed to saturate with
xenon under predetermined conditions of tempera-
ture and pressure, Melting of the fluoride plug
permits the saturated salt to flow into the other
section, while the U-tube seal prevents entrance of
goseous xenon into this section; refreezing of the
plug isolates the sections again. In the second
section, xenon is siripped from the salt by repeated
circulation of the hydrogen contained in the appa-
ratus through the salt and past a liquid-nitrogen-
cooled trap.
plete, the hydrogen is removed, the xenon is allowed

After the stripping process is com-

to come to room temperature, and the amount col-

70

lected is ascertained by measurements in a modi-
fied Mcleod gage.

Preliminary experiments at 600°C ond essentially
1 atm of xenon indicate that the solubility in the
NaF-KF-LiF eutectic is not greater than 10-7
mole of xenon per milliliter of salt, The method and
technique proved to be feasible, but minor experi-
mental difficulties necessitated modification of
More accurate data under
these and other conditions will be available in the
near future.

the nickel apparatus.

Meanwhile, in order to gain familiarity with the
technique, the solubility of xenon in the KNO,-
NaNO, eutectic (66 mole % NaNO,) has been
measured in an apparaius constructed entirely of
glass. The solubility of xenon in this melt is
about 8.5 x 108 mole/mi at 280°C and 10-7
mole/ml at 360°C. This liquid apparently shows
the positive temperature coefficient of solubility
expected for gases in molten salts,

salts is indicative of structural changes in the melt,
that is, of a decrease to a lower ionic coordination,
Volume increases up to 30% have been indicated for
the alkali halides. The x-ray data?® on the thermal
expansion of solid CsBr and Csl gave volume
changes of approximately 26%, but an extrapolation
of about 50°C to their melting points was required
for the computation of these changes, It was there-
fore of interest fo ascertain whether ao solid-phase
transition analogous to the one known to exist in
CsCl occurs in the unexplored temperature interval.
This would replace the assumed structural change
in the melting process by one in the solid state,

magnitude of the volume change found in complex
salts on melting. Nickel powder was admixed to
o sample of a homogeneous phase having the com-
position of NaF-ZrF, (53-47 mole %). The lattice
expansion was measured up to 491°C. The dota
are listed in Table 5.10. The volume expansion
from 25°C to the melting point is 3.8%. The volume
is on almost linear function of temperature, The
thermal coefficient of volume expansion, «, is
7.75 x 1075 deg™ 1. Thus the molar volume of the
solid at the melting point of 520°C gives a density
of 4.00 g/em®. The latter value is based on a
molecular weight of 1287.5 g, corresponding to the
presence in the unit cell of 6.77 NaF + 6 ZrF,

of the liquid density 27 of NaF-ZrF | (50-50 mole %)
measured at above 600°C to 520°C, a value of
3.32 g/cm? for the liquid is obtained, An adjust-
ment of this fo the composition of NaF-ZeF , (53-47
mole %), by assuming an almost constant molar
volume, lowers the density to approximately 3.2
g/cm. Thus a relatively large density and volume
change of 26% is indicated for this complex salt
on melting. The volume increase may be considered
gs indicative of a decrease in ionic coordination
in the fused state similar to that observed in the
CsBr and Csl salts.

The ionic coordination in the solid is assumed to
be similar to that in NaUF , for which Zachariasen
proposed ao fluorite type of packing with equal
coordinations for both the Na* and Zr4t of the
order of 8 or 9. It seems possible that the volume
increase on melting results from a lowering in the
coordination of the fluorines around Zr4*, which
might also be considered as radical ion formation
around zirconium; this point requires further study.

Well-formed single crystals which originated from
the central portion of a large melt of NaF-ZrF,
(53-47 mole %) have become available, Single-
crystal x-ray analysis has been initiated in an
attempt to make a complete structure determination,
especially of the positions of the fluoride ions,

The most important contaminants of fluoride
melts (HF, Fer ,, and NiF,) can be removed by
treatment of the melt with hydrogen, but this proc-
ess requires long periods for nearly complete re-
moval of the FeF,. Attempts have therefore been
made to demonstrate the effectiveness of zirconium
metal in removing these impurities in a short time.

In NaF.ZrF, Mixtures. Known concentrations of
contaminants were added to 3.5-kg batches of pre-
viously purified NaF-ZrF , (53-47 mole %) in nickel
containers and allowed to remain overnight at
800°C in contact with a considerchle excess of
metallic zirconium (30 g); some stirring was assured
by continuous sparging with helium, No experi-
mental difficulties were observed either in equili-
bration or in filtration of the product,

In one experiment, the 10 g of Fe, added gave
an initial contaminant concentration of 1700 ppm
Fe. After treatment, the contaminants present in
the filtrate were 70 ppm Fe, 15 ppm Ni, and 15 ppm
Cr. In a second experiment, 9 g of CrF, was added
to give an initial contaminant concentration of 1650
ppm Cr, The contaminants found in the filtrate in
this case were 90 ppm Fe, 25 ppm Ni, and 15 ppm
Cr. Thus these experiments indicate that the zir-
conium metal addition is an effective means of
preparing pure NoF-ZrF | mixtures.

In NeF-KF.LiF Mixtures. The purity of several
2-kg batches of NaF-KF-LiF eutectic after treat-
ment with hydrogen and with zirconium metal at

scavenging with metallic zirconium can be sub-
stituted for most, if not all, of the time-consuming
hydrogen stripping process. Since the impurities in
fluoride melts are initially present in low concen-
trations, it is anticipated that the small omount of

on the physical properties of the melt. However,
in these experiments at 800°C some alkali metal

some attack on the gaskets and flanges was ob-

Purification of NaoF-ZtF , Mixtures by Electrolysis

C. M. Blood H. A, Friedman
F. P. Boody F. W. Miles
G. M, Watson
Materials Chemistry Division

In the effort to obtain improved fuel purification
procedures it was shown that electrolysis in NaF-
Zr, melts aot 800°C with graphite anodes and
nickel cathodes reduces dissolved iron and nickel
to relatively low concentration in a much shorter
time than is required for the customary reduction
with hydrogen. Furthermore, the reduced impurities
were collected on a removable cathode that could
easily be withdrawn from pots with welded lids,
This feature promises to be of marked advantage in
processing large batches in equipment of a current
design which ollows the reduced metal from each
batch to recontaminate subsequent batches and
thereby multiply the amount of reduction required,

Careful attention was given to current-voltage
curves at all stages during the electrolysis in the
hope that “‘bredks’’ and apparent decomposition
potentials would permit the progress of the reduc-
tion to be followed. Filtered samples were removed
during various stages and analyzed for iron and
nickel to determine the actual amount present. To
facilitate analysis of the current-voltage curves, the
electrolysis pot was fitted with “floating'’ anode
ond cathode probes, which were used to determine

the potential between the melt and the “‘working”’
anode or cathode. The probes were made of %-in.
nickel rod; their potentials with respect to each
other and to both electrodes were followed through
many cycles of increasing ond decreasing applied
voltage, but the results have not been completely
interpreted,

J. A. Mclaren of the Chemical Technology
Division is of the opinion that measurements with
the reference electrodes have shown that the depo-
sition of iron takes place with very little over
voltage, At a current of 1 amp, iron was deposited
with a difference of potential between the cathode
and the nickel reference electrode of only 15 mv.
After depletion of the iron, the cathode potential
increased to 75 mv,

The anode potential was found to have a marked
discontinuity in the graph of current density and
voltage. At some critical current density the anode
voltage would increase suddenly. At the beginning
of the electrolysis the jump was found only at high
current densities, but as electrolysis continued,
it was found at lower current densities. The anode
jump was on the order of 0.2 to 2 v, an order of
magnitude greater than the increase found on the
cathode.

All the electrolyses were carried out in NaF-
ZrF, (47-53 mole %) mixtures in nickel containers.
The electrodes were suspended from the lid of a
3-kg capacity purification reactor (4 x 17 in.) with
modified spark plugs as insulating connectors; the
electrodes were immersed to a depth of about 4 in.
The anode was a Yomin.-dia C-18 graphite bar
threaded to a short length of nickel rod which was
welded to the spark plug. Direct current was
supplied from a Dresser Electric Co. 24-v 25-amp
selenium rectifier; measurements were made with
the use of suitable potentiometers, voltmeters,

ln the first experiments the nickel container was
used as the cathode, and helium gas was continu-
ously bubbled through the melt in order to stir and
The melt
was first thoroughly purified by a conventional HF

to remove gaseous electrode products,
treatment followed by reduction with hydrogen.
Then current-voltage curves were taken before and
after the addition of 1980 ppm Fe'* as FeF,. The
effect of the added impurity was readily noticeable.
The purified melt gave a curve like plot D of
Fig. 5.9, while the FeF ,-contaminated melt yielded
a curve similar to plot A, Extrapolation of the
curve obtained from the FeF ,-bearing melt gave a
decomposition potential of 0.9 v.

An elecirolyzing current of 5 amp was employed,
but numerous current-voltage curves were also
obtained so that at the end of 5 hr, 20.9 amp-hr had
passed. This was approximately twice the theo-
retical ampere-hours required to reduce the Fett,
a sample removed at this time analyzed 50 ppm Fe
and demonstrated that a fairly complete reduction
had been achieved with at least 50% current effi-
ciency. No evolution of fluorine was noted, nor
was there an appreciable attack on the nickel con-
tainer. The wall which had been in contact with
the vapor appeared to be covered with a fine dust,
presumably Nif ,.

For the next series of experiments a new batch
of freshly purified melt was used, hydrogen was
substituted for helium, and a current of 10 amp was
passed. Three purifications were carried out in
succession with addition of FeF, and NiF, to
simulate impurities, os shown in the first part of
Table 5.12. Apparent current efficiencies based on

data from Table 5.12 are deceptive because some
of the reduction is accomplished by hydrogen, which
gives high values, and also because the current
efficiency for purification becomes very low when
the amount of impurity to be reduced is very small,
When the container was used as a cathode, 6 v was
the maximum applied potential required to obtain a

effluent gas of about 1073 mole of HF per liter of

current of 10 amp.

In another series of experiments a removable
cathode, insulated from the pot, was used. The
cathode was a % x 4 in, cylinder of nickel gauze
welded to a Yin, nickel rod; the gauze was made
of 15-mil wire, 25 wires to the inch. The dimen-
sions were chosen to be in the correct proportion
for a small-scale model of a 250-1b capacity pro-
duction reactor. To obtain a relatively high level of
initial impurity, approximately 20 g of FeF, and
20g of NiF, were mixed with the starting materials.
After the usual HF treatment before electrolysis,
a sample was removed to determine the iron con-
centration. The results of the trial are summarized
in the second part of Table 5.12.

At the end of 12.5 amp-hr the cathode was re-
moved; it had gained 10.3 g of metallic iron (as
computed from chemical analysis), representing a
97% yield, A new cathode was then used until a
total of 37 amp-hr had passed; this cathode gained
0.2 g of iron, and thus the percentage recovery
had been increased to 99%. A current of 10 amp
gave current densities of 11.7 amp/cm? of anode
surface. By doubling the nominal area of gauze
used as the cathode to obtain the total surface
area both inside and out, the current density at the

In all runs under hydrogen, the effluent gas was
bubbled through KOH solution to remove HF. A
sample of the gos after removal of HF was analyzed
by mass spectrometry and found to contain 3.17%
CH,, 1.25% H,0 (from the KOH solution), 0.73%
N,, and only about 0.02% CF,. Evidently the
predominant anode product is HF. The anodes
disappeared at a rate corresponding to a life ex-
pectancy longer than 50 amp-hr, The cathode de-
posits were expected to contain zirconium metal,
and this was qualitatively confirmed by the high
zirconium analysis (53.9 wt % for the cathode that
gained 0.2 g of iron) in the scrapings of mixed
metal and salt from the cathode. However, the
zirconium metal could not be distinguished by x-ray
diffraction,

The conclusion was reached that electrolysis
with removable cathodes was a practical and effi-
cient means of purifying fluoride melts containing
structural metal impurities. Experiments to investi-
gate the removal of sulfates and oxides by elec-
trolysis and an attempt to electrolytically reduce
UF, to UF; are in progress.

A typical set of current-voltage curves is shown
in Fig. 5.9. These curves apply to the experiment
with removable cathodes and illustrate the charac-
teristic ‘‘knees’’ or breaks in the current-voltage
curves as the voltage is increased or decreased.
The ‘‘knees’’ are apparently due to a polarization
phenomenon and show considerable hysteresis,
A correlation between the current at which breaks

occur and the ompere-hours passed is presented in

Preparation of UF ;-Bearing Fuels

Materials Chemistry: Division

Since preliminary results have shown that UF ,-
bearing fuels are less corrosive to Inconel than
UF ;-bearing fuels, considerable effort has been
devoted to studying methods for preparing these
materiols. The experiments. performed thus far
have given results that are not as yet well under-
stood.

The tabulated values for standard free energy of
formation indicate that at 800°C the reaction

%U° + JUF, ==UF,, AF°= ~16 kcal,

should proceed to essential completion if the com-
pounds are in their standard states. There is ample
evidence that UF, dissolved in NaZrF, is more
stable to reduction by chromium than would be
expected,” but the difference between the expected
and the actual stability is hardly sufficient to
suggest that reduction of UF, by uranium metal
should be detectably incomplete.

The reduction of UF, to UF, with uranium or
zirconium metal has been attempted in a large
number of preparations by the following technique.
About 500 g of material containing the predetermined
quantity of UF, is treated with HF and H, in nickel
equipment in the usual fashion to render it essen-
tially free from contaminants. This purified mixture
is cooled below the melting point, and the desired
quantity of uranium or zirconium metal turnings As
added, The reaction is allowed fo proceed while
the mixture in the reactor is stirred by a stream of
hydrogen bubbling through it. Samples of the melt
can be obtained by drawing a sample into a filter
stick of nickel containing a sintered-nickel filter
medium, The specimens removed from the filter
stick are available for petrographic, x-ray, and wet
chemical examination.

The data obtained from several preparations are
presented in Table 5.13. It is obvious that com-
plete reduction was not obtained in any preparation
and that reduction in the NaF-KF-LiF system was
much less complete than in the other solvents.
While the number of experiments performed to date
may be too small to establish reliable trends, the
following pertinent observations con be made on
the basis of examination of these experiments and
results.

UF, in ZrF, Systems. About 90% of the antici-
pated reduction was obtained when large quantities
of reducing agent were used fo obtain UF, in
ZrF ;-bearing mixtures. In view of the extreme
precautions which must be observed to prevent
oxidation of the material during preparation and
handling, it appears safe to state that about 90% of
the UF; can be reduced under optimum conditions.
No alkali metal was observed under the operating
conditions used. The extent of reduction in these
systems could be qualitatively distinguished by
petrographic examination,

UF, in Molten LiF. More than 90% of the UF, in
molten LiF was reduced in each case, but complete
reduction was not accomplished. It is not possible
to say whether the difference between 0.96 ot
825°C and 0.91 at 850°C is real. No alkali metal
vapor Petrographic examination
detected the presence of small quantities of UF ,.

UF, in Molten NaF-KF.LiF. In five experiments
at 780 to 800°C the maximum reduction obtained in
NaF-KF-LiF was 48% of that expected. The extent
of reduction was only slightly affected by an in-
crease in the reducing agent from 92 to 121% and
by an increase in the reaction time from 3 to 52 hr,

was detected,

At lower equilibration temperatures the extent of
reduction was increased. The highest value was
obtained af the shortest equilibration time and with
the largest excess of reducing agent.

In all the experiments ot 780 to 800°C, alkali
metal vapor was evident; however, at 600°C no
alkali vapor was observed. It is possible that a
part of the difficulty in obtaining complete reduction
is due to reactions of the type

U+ 3KF&==UF, + 3K°, AF° = +26.1kcal,
and

UF, + KFe==2UF, + K°, AF° = +30.3 keal,
where the metallic potossium being relatively

volatile is removed from the reaction by the hydro-
gen stream, lt is also possible that the dispropor-
tionation reaction
UF e==3 UF, + JU,  AF° = +16 kcal,
is responsible. However, it is especially difficult
to see why this reaction should be more important
in an NaF-KF-LiF solution than in an LiF solution,
Under petrographic examination the products of
the eight experiments with NaF-KF-LiF solution
appeared to be identical even though by chemical
analyses they showed widely different UF -to-UF

The alkali-matal fluoride processing facility come

ment of suitable processes for the production of
atkali-metal

fluoride mixiures containing UF

There have been several! preparstions, however, of

special batches of other compositions to fulfill

specific needs. Single batches of approximately
2.5 kg can be prepared in this equipment, During
the quarter, 27 preparations that yielded about 70 kg
of material were made.

Repeated attempts to prepare NaF-KF-LiF mix-
tures containing 14 wt % UF; and 1 wt % UF, by
reduction of UF, with uranium metal yielded mix-
tures containing 5 to 7 wt % UF, by chemical
analysis. These results, along with those reported
elsewhere in this document, seem to show that in
systems containing KF, reduction of UF, by ure-
nium metal is markedly incomplete. Pending clari-
fication of this point, production of material con-
taining 5 wt % UF; and 10 wt % UF, is under way.

During the past quarter, 1760 kg of processed

external and internal distribution. A bredkdown of
the production according to composition is given
below:

Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Division received 27 kg
of NaF-ZrF (50-50 mole %) and 113 kg of NaF-
ZrF ,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %). Battelle Memorial
Institute received 46 kg of NaF-ZrF ,-UF , (50-46-4
mole %) and 68 kg of NaF-ZrF, (50-50 mole %).
The remaining processed material was distributed
to various requesters in the ANP Program.

The difficulties associated with the long stripping
times and large hydrogen volumes required for pro-
duction of rigorously pure fluoride melts from the
raw materials available have not yet been over-
come.3? Attempts to shorten the time required by
increasing the hydrogen flow rate from 4 to 15

the gas inlet tubes plugged quite frequently and
the HF concentration in the exit hydrogen fell
much below the value obtained at lower flow rates.
The over-all purification time was not appreciably
shortened by the fourfold increase in hydrogen
passed,

Sublimation of crude ZrF, at a temperature lower
than that previously used by Y-12 personnel did
not appreciably improve the purity of the ZrF,

requires much less time than does the hydrogen

in the production facility is being modified slightly

the electrolytic purification process will consider-
ably decrease the cost of fuel preparation.

The first in-pile loop was loaded on June 11 with
a fuel concentrate, NaF-ZrF ,-UF, (62.5-12.5-25.0
mole %), prepared from enriched uranium by Y-12
personnel. The loading apparatus and controls
performed satisfactorily, and the transfer of ma-
terial to the loop went smoothly. However, the
electrical contact which should have indicated
when the loop was filled to operating level was
not activated even after 120% of the calculated
charge had been added.

Subsequent examination of the loop showed that
a weld had given way where the loop was connected
to the pump bowl, and it seems certain that this
leak was present during the filling operation, ' The
U233 is being salvaged from the loop. Examination
of the filling apparatus revealed that all but 68 g
of a total of 5837 g of the material was transferred
to the loop.

Eighteen baiches of NaOH were purified by filter-

sintered-glass filter to remove the Na,CO, and by
dehydration at 400°C under vacuum. Approximately
one-half the runs yielded products containing less
thon 0.1 wt % H,0 and 0.1 wi % Na,CO,. The
remaining runs yielded less than 0.1 wt % H,0, but
the values for No, CO, ranged from 0.11 to 0.2 wt %.
Four 0.5-1b portions of potassium were reacted
with water, and the resulting solutions of KOH were
dehydrated ot 400°C under vacuum. The resulting
material contained less than 0.1 wt % K,CO,, 0.1

Reaction of Sodium Hydroxide with Metals

Work has been continued on the reaction of copper
and sodium hydroxide, Data were previously re-
ported33 on copper concentrations found in NaOH
up to 800°C. A recent determination at 900°C
shows 2500 ppm Cu in the melt after exposure,
This value is higher than would be expected from
the previous data taken from 600 to 800°C. A plot
of log Cu concentration vs 1/T yields a straight
line from 600 to 800°C and thus suggests that true
equilibrium values were obtained. Extension of
this line would give a value of about 1500 ppm
rather than the 2500 ppm Cu obtained.

Reactions of copper and nickel with sodium hy-
droxide were previously investigated by determining
the equilibrium hydrogen pressures developed.
Monel, an alloy composed primarily of copper and
nickel, has now been investigated by this method.
The Monel reaction tube containing the melt was
surrounded by a quartz envelope, to which was
attached a manometer for determination of the
hydrogen pressure. Establishment of equilibrium
required long periods of time, and the values ob-
tained were not completely reproducible. Therefore,
only a range of equilibrium pressures is presented
in the following for the sodium hydroxide-~Monel
reaction:

Temperature (°C) Pressure (mm Hg)

600 35 to 42

700 112 to 130
800 160 to 193
900 232 to 280
1000 280 to 360

In another series of tests nickel oxide (reagent-
grade commercial heated to 700°C in
vacuum) was added to sodium hydroxide in a jacketed
nickel tube, At 350°C a pressure of 22 mm Hg was
found,

material

Mass spectrographic analysis of the gas
revealed 5.6% hydrogen and the remainder to be
essentially water vapor, The temperature of the
test was increased to 500°C and then, in 100°C
increments, to 1000°C., The pressure in no case
exceeded 31 mm Hg, which is approximately the
saturated ambient water-vapor pressure. Analyses
of the gas showed it to be 97 to 98% water vapor,
with a little hydrogen, Under otherwise identical
test conditions, no water vapor was found when
nickel oxide was omitted, The net effect of the
nickel oxide is apparently that of oxidizing the
hydrogen formed from the Ni-NaOH reaction to water
vapor.

The static and seesaw corrosion testing facilities
were used for further studies of brazing olloys,
special Stellite heats, Hastelloy R, Inconel, graph-
ite, and various ceramics in sodium, fluoride fue!
mixtures, and other mediums. : For the fabrication
of many reactor components if may be well to have
a brazing alloy that is compatible both with sodium
and with the fluoride fuels. Therefore several cor-
rosion tests were performed on Inconel joints brazed
with high-temperature brazing alloys. From this
work it was found that the brazing alloy 67% Ni-13%
Ge-11% Cr—-6% Si-2% Fe-1% Mn has good cor-
rosion resistance in fluoride fuels and fair corrosion
resistance in sodium. Two special heats of Stellite
were tested that had a lower carbon content than
those tested previously, and it was found that the
fower carbon content increased the corrosion
resistance in the fluoride fuels.

High-density graphite was tested in sodium and
in fluoride mixtures; it has very poor resistance to
sodium attack but seems to have fair resistance fo
the fluoride fuels.
ceramics and cermets, have been investigated from
the corrosion standpoint for use as bearings, seals,
and valve seats; Al,0,, MgAl,O,, ZrO,, and SiC
were tested in sodium, a fluoride fuel, lithium, and
lead. In these tests, SiC showed the best corrosion
resistance.

Various hard-facing materials,

In the thermal-convection loop corrosion studies,
emphasis has shifted to fuels with the uranium
present as UF, and to loops of Hastelloy B. Hot-
leg attack is not found in Inconel loops in which
ZrF base fluoride mixtures with the uranium as
UF, are circulated. A deposit is, however, found
on the hot-leg surface. Only preliminary information
is available, but it appears that neither attack nor
a hot-leg layer is found with alkali-metal-base fluo-
ride mixtures containing UF. Mixtures of UF; and
UF, will result in a reduction in attack from that
found with only UF ,, but some attack is present
and in high-uranium-content systems it may be
significant.

The addition of zirconium hydride to the ZrF ,-
base fuel mixtures containing UF, was found to

result in the formation of UF, and in a reduction
in corrosion. However, to obtain a complete ab-
sence of corrosion, sufficient hydride must be
added to cause a loss of uranium.

Several Hastelloy B loops have now been suc-
cessfully operated in both the as-received and the
over-aged conditions. In both cases, a considerable
increase in hardness occurs during operation, With
ZrF bose mixtures containing UF,, very little
attack is found, even after 1000 hr,

The mass transfer cheoracteristics of type 316
stainless steel in molten lithium were studied by
using thermal-convection loops. After 1000 hr of
loop operation, there was no sign of plug formation,
and only a small amount of mass transfer was found
in one of the loops. The investigation of the cor-
rosion and mass transfer characteristics of materials
in contact with liquid iead has shown that certain
alloys possess a much greater resistance tc mass
transfer than the pure components of those alloys.
The probable reason for this resistance to mass
transfer can be related to the formation of inter-
metallic compounds in these alloys. This has been
proved in the case of alloys of 45% Cr—55% Co,

Ni-Mo alloys, and the Fe-Cr-bose stainless steels.

The flammability of liquid sodium alloys has
been studied, and it has been found that only bis.
muth and mercury have an effect on the flammability
of sodium. ‘It was found that the degree of reaction
of Na-Bi ond Na-Hg alloys with air was not signifi-
cantly changed when the pressure was varied from
0.25 to 1 atm. An investigation has been started to
determine the amount of hydrogen liberated when
NaOH is heated to 900°C in an inert environment,
The container problem has been solved by using a
large single crystal of magnesium oxide. A thermo-
dynamic study of the alkali-metal hydroxides: has
shown that hydrogen is important in stabilizing
NaOH at temperatures above 800°C. This is the
temperature range at which mass transfer becomes
significant in Ni-NaOH systems. These computa-
tions link the formation of hydrogen with the forma-
tion of unsoturated oxygen ions, which may be
necessary for moss transfer to occur.

ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

A plausible explanation has been developed for
the evidence of a maximum in the corrosion of In-
conel by molten fluorides in static tests at 800 to
900°C and for both void formation and chromium
concentration in the melt being less at 1000°C than
at 800°C. Static tests of type 316 stainless steel
in NaZrF¢ and in NaF-ZrF ,-UF ; substantiated the

phenomena observed with Inconel.

Additional corrosion experiments with fuel mix-
tures containing simulated fission products have
shown that the experimental procedure being fol-
lowed is entirely unsatisfactory. A controlled-
velocity corrosion testing apparatus has been con-
structed for the rapid transfer of molten fluoride
mixtures through both heated and cooled test sec-
tions. This apparatus was designed to simulate
conditions in reactor components.

in contact with this alloy enly in the event of a
tube-to-header weld fracture. It may be concluded
from the results of these tests that further study is
warranted on alloys A and B; both showed good re-
sistance fo attack by the fluoride mixture. Special
emphasis will be placed on alloy A, since it

attack by lithium on high-nickel-content alloys (for

is greater than the attack by sodium. The sample

Inconel! in Molten Rubidium

Tests were conducted on rubidium metal in con-
nection with an ORSORT project. Rubidium has a
low melting point, 92°F, and a low boiling point,
1270°F, and therefore is being considered as a
possible reactor coolant. The rubidium metal used
in the experiments was prepared by calcium re-
duction of the rubidium fluoride salt by the Stable
Isotope Research and Production Division.

An initial attempt to determine the vapor pressure
vs temperature relationship up to 1650°C was un-
successful. However, the test equipment has been
redesigned and another attempt will be made in the
near future, Inconel has been tested in contact
with static rubidium for 100 hr ot 1650°F. The at-
tack varied from 0.5 mil in the vapor zone to a
maximum of 1.5 mils at the liquid-gas interface, as
shown in Fig. 6.8. The rubidium used was not dis-
tilled and is known to have contained several per

ditional static tests are under way with triple-
distilled rubidium, and an Inconel thermal convection
loop is being operated with boiling rubidivm, Fig.
6.9. This loop has now operated for several hundred
hours without difficulty. :

Carburization of Inconel by Sodium

it is well known that sodium, in addition to de-
carburizing metals, can, in some cases, carburize
them if the carbon concentration in the sodium is
sufficiently high. Therefore, an attempt is being
made to determine whether small additions of carbon
- would prevent decarburization of Inconel specimens
during long-time creep tests in contact with sodium
at elevated temperatures. A-nicke! containers are
being used for static tests so that the ratio of
Inconel surface area to sodium volume will be
small. The maximum solubility of carbon in nickel

at 1500°F is approximately 0.1%, and therefore the
carburization of the nickel containers in these
tests is very slight. The A-nickel used for the
containers was found by analysis to contain only

0.05% carbon.

The ratio of the Inconel surface to the sodium
volume in the tests performed to date was 0.76.
The Inconel specimens used were 0.049-in. sheet
reduced to 0.015 in, by cold rolling, and they were
annealed for 2 hr at 1650°F. The carbon additions
(1, 5, and 10 wt %) were made to the sodium in the
form of small fumps of reactor-grade graphite.

The nickel containers were loaded with the In-
cone! specimens, the grophite, ond the sodium in a
dry box in a purified helium atmosphere and sealed
under vacuum. As shown in Table 6.4 and Fig.
6.10, all the specimens were very heavily carburized
and extremely brittle after exposure for 100 hr at
1500°F. Also, they were partly covered with a

other tests with degassed graphite and standard
tests with no graphite addition. Therefore prepa-
rations are being made for obtaining oxygen-free

Special Tar-Impregnated and Fired Graphite

A special tar-impregnated and fired graphite,
known commercially as Graph-i-tite, has been tested
for corrosion resistance to sodium and NoF-ZrF ,-
UF, (53.5-40-6.5 mole %). Also, a comparison was
made of the carburization of an austenitic stainless
steel by contact with Graph-i-tite and with C-18
graphite (reactor grade). The Graph-i-tite was
fabricated, as described previously, by tar-impreg-
nating and firing graphite 16 times. The repeated
tar impregnations and firings produce a high density

An open Graph-i-tite crucible containing sodium

vious test,’ and caused it to crack and crumble.

The only macroscopically visible sign of attack on
the crucible that contained the fluoride mixture was
that the inner surface had a higher gloss (Fig. 6.11)

sections of the crucible indicated irregular pene-
tration from 0 to 5 mils deep. No attempt has been

compared with the 0 to 2 mils attack by NaF-ZrF -
UF, (50-46-4 mole %) in the previous tests. The
carbon content of the fluoride mixture did not change
significantly in either test.

A comparison of the carburization of austenitic
stainless stee! by tar-impregnated and fired graphite
and by C-18 graphite (reactor grade) was obtained
through static tests of cylinders of the same size
of each type of graphite in type 304 stainless steel
tubes containing equal quantities of sodium in
vacuum. Tests for 100- and 500-hr periods ai
1500°C were made on each type of graphite. Type
304 stainless steel was chosen because it carbur-
izes more readily than other austenitic stainless
steels.

The results of the tests are shown in Figs. 6.12
and 6.13. In the 100-hr test, the tar-impregnated
and fired graphite carburized the type 304 stainless
steel to a slightly greater extent than the C-18
graphite did, and in the 500-hr test, it clearly car-
burized the steel to a greater extent, After the
500-hr tests of both types of graphite, steel in con-
tact with the sodium showed small subsurface
voids; the voids were pronounced in the steel tested
with the tar-impregnated and fired graphite. The
depth of carburization of the type 304 stainless
steel above the level of the molten sodium covering
the graphite cylinders was 1 mil in all the tests,
except the 500-hr test with a tar-impregnated and
fired graphite cylinder in which there was carbu-
rization of the steel to a depth of 2 mils.

Ceramics in Various Mediums

Static corrosion screening tests of three ceramic
oxides and one carbide (Al,O,, MgAl,0,, calcium
stabilized ZrO,, and SiC) were made in a vacuum
atmosphere at 1500°F for 100 hr in each of four
mediums: sodium, NaF-ZrF ,-UF , (53.5-40-6.5 mole
%), lithium, and lead. A fourth ceramic oxide was
tested under the same conditions in sodium and in
NaF-ZrF -UF, (53.5-40-6.5 mole %). The Al,O,
and MgAl,O, test pieces were cut from single,
synthesized crystals; the MgO test pieces were
cleaved from a single, synthesized crystal. The
nominal dimensions of the test pieces and the re-

sults of the tests are given in Table 6.5. Powder
x-ray examinations were made of the specimens
that were the least corrosion resistant in each

Preliminary results of Inconel thermal-convection

loop tests of the corrosive properties of UF, -bearing

compared with the corrosive properties of UF ,-

formation of a hot-leg layer. The lack of attack
and the hot-ley layer are illustrated in Fig. 6.14.

ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

The portion of a hot leg shown in Fig. 6.14 was
taken from an Inconel thermal-convection loop which
had circulated UF, 2.1 wt % UF, in 2.4 wt %
total U) in NaF-ZrF , (53-47 mole %) for 500 hr at
a hot-leg temperature of 1500°F, The fluoride mix-
ture wos drained from the loop at the operating
temperature to ascertain whether the layers pre-
viously noted had formed during cooling of the loop.
Since the layer wos again present, it is now con-
sidered to have formed during operation. This
conclusion was further strengthened when the
metallographic examination revealed a diffusion
zone between the layer and the base metal, An
examination of the layer by o microspark spectro-
graphic technique’ showed it to be predominantly
zirconium. Since this technique is not sensitive
to uranium, the layer could also contain uranium.

There is some indication that some of the UF
dissociates to produce uranium metal, which re-
duces some of the ZrF , to produce zirconium metal.
The accuracy of the analytical determination for
zirconium is not sufficient fo revea! the reaction
products postulated, since some zirconium is also
lost by sublimation.

In another Inconel loop in which UF, in NaF-
ZrF , was circulated for 2000 hr at 1500°F, some

voids were found to a depth of 4 mils upon metallo-

graphic examination. The voids did not appear to
be the same as those normally found, and it is
thought that they were formed when brittle inter-
metallic compounds were pulled out of the base
metal during polishing. No hot-leg attack could be
found, as shown in Fig. 6.15, but there was a layer
0.5 mil thick on the hot-leg surface. This layer
was also reported to be predominantly zirconium.

It has been definitely established thot the use of
UF, rather than UF, in ZrF base mixtures will
fower the corrosive attack and mass transfer in
Inconel systems. However, it has been found to be
impossible to dissolve sufficient UF, in ZrF 4-base
mixtures to obtain fuels of interest for high-temper-
To obtain a fuel with sufficient
uranium, it would be necessary to use a mixture
of UF; and UF,. Data obtained from loops oper-
ated with such mixtures and with standard UF ,-
bearing mixtures are presented in Table 6.7. The
data show clearly that a mixture of UF, and UF,
produces less attack than UF, alone, but the mix-
ture does not eliminate the attack, as is the case
with UF; alone,

Effect of UF, in Alkali-Meta! Base Fuels

It has been found that more UF, can be dissolved
in the alkali-metal-base fluoride mixtures than in
the ZrF ,-base mixtures, and therefore additional
tests were made with NaF-KF-UiF (11.5-42.0-46.5
mole %) containing UF,, UF,, and mixtures of the
two.

ficulties, the relative amounts of UF; and UF are
not known, but it appears that about one-third of
the uranium was present as UF,. One loop con-
tained a total uranium content of 10.4 wt %, and
after the test the hot leg showed light, widely
scattered attack to a depth of 1 mil (Fig. 6.16);
the hot-leg surface was quite rough. The other
loop contained 7.4 wt % uranium, and the hot leg
showed a void type of attack that varied from light
to heavy, with a maximum penetration of 2 mils;
again, the surface was rough. In both loops, a
layer was found in the cold leg but not in the hot
leg. These mixtures appear to be superior to the
ZrF ,-base mixtures with UF, with respect fo depth
of the subsurface void type of attack, and the hot-
leg deposit found with the UF ;-bearing ZrF ;-base
mixtures did not form. More work is needed to de-
termine whether the rough surfaces represent a
different type of attack and whether the cold-leg
deposits formed are NaK,CrF,, which would
interfere with heat transfer.

Effect of Zirconium Hydride Additions to Fuel

Yarious amounts of zirconium hydride were added
to NaF-ZrF ,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %) as a means of
reducing the UF, to UF;. The hydride was added
to smal! portions of fluorides taken from the same
original batch, and filters were used when the
small batches were transferred to Inconel thermal-
convection loops. The data from loops operated
with these batches of fluoride mixture are given in
Table 6.8. layers were found in the cold legs of
all loops to which the ZrH, additions had been
made. The data show that to obtain sufficient
reducing power by the addition of ZrH, to eliminate
corrosion it may be impossible to prevent the loss
of some uranium both in the treatment pot and in
the loop.

Effect of Uranium Concentration

Two loops were operated with a high-purity NaF-
ZrF,-UF, (53.5-40-6.5 mole %) mixture. This mix-
ture is comparable to the one to be used in the
ARE ond has a higher uranium content than the
mixture normally used in thermal-convection loop
tests. The heavy hot-leg attack in both loops was
of the usual subsurface-void type with a maximum
penetration of 10 mils. This is slightly deeper
than the 6 to 8 mils found with the lower uranium
content mixtures. Thin metallic-appearing layers
were found in the cold legs of both loops. The
results obtained with these loops confirm those
found previously with similar, but impure, mixtures.

Effect of Inconel Grain Size

Inconel pipe was annealed at two temperatures to
provide specimens with different grain sizes. A

series of loops fabricated from the annealed pipe
was filled from the same batch of NaF-Z¢F ,-UF
(50-46-4 mole %) and operated for 500 hr at 1500°F.
Two loops were made from pipe annealed at 2100°F
that had a grain size of 1 to 1 gr/in.2 at 100 X,
while the loop fabricated from as-received Inconel
pipe and the one fabricated from pipe annealed at
1600°F contained about 6 gr/in.2. Very little dif-
ference in hot-leg attack was found in these loops.
Those with the larger grains may have had slightly
deeper attack, but the attack was heavier and more
general and the deep penetrations were concentrated
into fewer boundaries.

FLUORIDE CORROSION OF HASTELLOY B
IN THERMAL.CONVECTION LOOPS

G. M. Adamson
Metallurgy Division

Loops fabricated from both as-received and over-
aged Hastelloy B were operated satisfactorily.
The operating mortality rate has been reduced from
90% to 0% in the last group of four loops. The
increase in hardness during operation is not so
great in the loops constructed with over-aged
material as in the loops constructed with as-
received material, but, with proper care, the loops
of as-received material can be operated.

Very little attack was found in a loop which
circulated NaF-ZrF -UF, (50-46-4 mole %) for
1000 hr ot 1500°F, The attack appeared as a few
voids to a maximum depth of 1 mil, with possibly
some increase in surface roughness. Most of the
surface roughness was present in the as-received
tubing, as shown in Fig. 6.17.

completely; loops 2 and 3 have been sectioned
and have been examined macroscopically. Loop 2
was very similar in appearance to loop 1, with no
crystal deposition. Loop 3, however, revealed
mass-transfer crystals attached to the cold-zone
walls, These crystals did not plug the loop or
noticeably affect the circulation. The crystal
deposition was heaviest on the major radius of the
exposed loop-bend wall in the cold zone. This
loop has not yet been examined metallographically.

Loop 1, which was operated at the highest temper-
ature and with the highest temperature differential,
had no mass-transfer crystals in the cold zone, and
the maximum attack in the hot zone was 1 to 2
mils (Fig. 6.18). Chemical analyses of the lithium
and the amounts of crystals recovered are presented
in Table 6.10. At present it is not understood why
so little mass transfer occurred in loops 1 and 2,
since in all three loops the same procedures and
testing techniques were used and all were filled
from the same batch of lithium. Some as yet un-
discovered factor seems to have an effect on the
rate of mass transfer.

Mass Transfer in Liquid Lead

J. V. Cathcart
Metallurgy Division

As previously reported,® the investigation of
corrosion and mass transfer in liquid lead has indi-
cated that certain alloys possess much greater
resistance to mass transfer than their pure com-
ponents. For example, the time required for small
thermal-convection loops containing types 410 and
446 stainless steel to plug was from two to five
times longer than that required for comparable loops
containing pure iron or pure chromium.

It has been suggested® that the increased re-
sistance to mass iransfer of materials such as the
400 series stainless steels might be related to a
toward the formation of intermetallic

further, a loop was operated which contained speci-

This alloy composition corresponded to a two-phase

revealed that the plugging time for all those in

bility [types 410 and 446 stainless steel, 2%

Ni~37% Cr-47% Fe (austenite plus sigma)l was in
excess of 500 hr, the only exception being the loop
containing the 16% Ni-37% Cr-47% Fe specimens
which plugged in 456 hr. The plugging times for
loops containing the pure constituents of these
alloys were: Ni, 2 hr; Co, 80 hr; Cr, 100 hr; and
Fe, 250 hr. No mass transfer was observed in a
loop containing molybdenum specimens after 500

hr of operation. On the other hand, loops with
specimens of alloys for which there is virtually no
tendency toward compound formation (types 304
and 347 stainless steel, Inconel, and nichrome)
all plugged in less than 150 hr. On the basis of
these data, it was concluded that resistance to
mass transfer in liquid lead is considerably greater
in alloys in which intermetallic compound formation
is possible,

Future work will include tests of two alloys: one
with the composition of 50% Cr—50% Fe and the
other with approximately 50% Fe~50% Mo. These
compositions correspond closely to the composi-
tions of intermetallic compounds in types 410 and
446 stainless steel, and if the ideas presented
above are correct, both should show relatively
high resistance to mass transfer in liquid lead.

The studies of the flammability of liquid sodium
alloys, which were reported previously,” were ex-
tended. It has been found that the degree of re-
action of jets of sodium-bismuth and sodium-mercury
alloys is not significantly changed when the pres-
sure of air is varied from 0.25 to 1.0 atm.

Additional data on the reactivity of sodium-
bismuth solutions in dry air were obtained, and
the results are summarized in Figs. 6.20 ond 6.21.
Figure 6.20 shows the limits of the region of no
reaction on o temperature-composition diagram, A
careful calibration of the flammability apparatus
has shown that there was a substantial error in the
temperatures previously reported in these tests.
tn this respect the earlier data have been corrected.
The circles represent the temperature-composition
values at which tests were conducted. The numeral
by each circle gives the number of tests. The un-
shaded circles represent tests which showed re-

Free Energy of Formation Data. Numerical data
for the standard free energies of formation of the
atkali-metal hydroxides and related compounds are
an essential guide in studies of hydroxide chemistry.
Therefore the free energy data have been computed
as a function of temperature for the hydroxide, the
peroxide, and the superoxide of sodium. The data
are presented in Fig. 6.22, together with the data
for the oxide and water which are used in subsequent
computations in this report,

Values of the standard free energy of formotion
at 25°C are available® for sodium oxide, sodium
peroxide, and sodium superoxide. The value for
sodium hydroxide may be computed readily from

temperatures, values of the standard free energy of

mated for sodium peroxide, sodium superoxide, and
sodium hydroxide in the following way. The curves
of the standard free energy of formation vs temper-
ature for the class of compounds dealt with here
are known to a fairly good degree of approximation
to consist of segmented straight lines with dis-
continuous changes in slope at the transition
points of the compound and of its component ele-
ments. One point on each of these curves can be
fixed from the values for the standard free energy
of formation data at 25°C, mentioned above. The

These entropy data are obtained from the standard:
state entropy values. The change in slope at each
transition point is determined from the transition
entropy, which, of course, is readily computed from
the heat of transition.

Recently obtained data'? on the heat capacity of
liquid sodium hydroxide will permit a more precise
evaluation to be made of the slope of the free
energy curve from the melting point up to 1000°C.
The heat of fusion of sodium peroxide (Ty = 980°K)
was not available, but it should introduce only a
small change in slope, which may be considered to
be negligible for the computations which follow.

Decomposition of Hydroxides. In considering any
solvent as a reaction medium it is important to: de-
termine whether the solvent tends to decompose to
an appreciable extent, particularly if any of the
products of the decomposition take part in the re-
action. The classic example is, of course, water.
Here the covalent water molecules decompose
slightly into ions. The resulting equilibrium fre-
quently exerts a controlling influence on the course
of aqueous reactions. The following is an outline
of the results obtained to date in a theoretical
search for the significant decomposition equilibria
in fused olkali-metal hydroxides. It should be
emphasized that the work presented here is in no
sense definitive or complete.

The most important result of the treatment given
here is the evidence for the possible occurrence of
appreciable quantities of peroxide as the result of
decomposition equilibria. The way in which this
peroxide may play a decisive role in mass transfer
and corrosion will be shown in ao later report.

In a fused alkali-metal hydroxide in an inert
environment such that the volume of any gas phase
is small compared with that of the liquid phase,
the fused hydroxide may be regarded thermodynami-
cally as being in equilibrium with every chemical
species composed of nothing more than oxygen,
hydrogen, and the alkali metal. In practice, many
of these chemical species can be ignored for either

of two reasons, First, the equilibrium concentra-
tion of the species in question maybe insignificant.
Second, the rate of formation of the species in
question may be so slow that it does not approach
equilibrium in any time period which may be con-
sidered. Since in the following discussion the
thermodynamic approach is used, only the first
reason will be treated.

There are three particularly useful theoretical
measures of the significance of a decomposition
reaction. They are the equilibrium constant, the
standard free energy change, and the concentration
of the products of decomposition. The third measure
is the most directly related to experiment and hence,
at the present stage, the most useful. The only
concentration in a fused hydroxide which can be
measured af temperature by present methods is the
partial pressure of a gaseous product. Hence,
considerable emphasis is placed on possible de-
composition reactions which produce gaseous
products and on an expression of their equilibrium
concentrations in terms of the decomposition
pressure,

The decomposition pressure of a pure substance
with regard to a gaseous product is referred to here
as that partial pressure of the gaseous product
which, when in equilibrium with the condensed
phase, is required to maintain the over-all composi-
tion of the condensed phase equal to the composition
of the pure substance. According to the phase
rule, the pressure so defined is unique for a given
temperature. If there are several gaseous products,
there is o decomposition pressure for each such
product,

The standard states used here are those con-
ventionally chosen in defining the standard free
energy of formation. Although this is not the usual
choice of standard states in the case of solutes,
it is definitely the most convenient choice for the
computations which follow.

The four possible decomposition reactions which
give a gaseous product at the temperatures at which
the hydroxides are liquid are considered here.
They are as follows:

K
1 °
(1) 2MOH =" M,0 + H,0, AFY ,
2 Ky °
(2) 2MOH = M0, +H, , AFS ,
Kq
(3) 2MOH =3 MO, + M + H, , ARS,

104

K
(4) 2MOH =* MO, + MH + LH, , AF,

where all substances are partitioned among all
phases present and where K; and AF? are the
equilibrium constants and standard free energies
of reaction respectively,

The sparsity of reliable information on the alkali
metal -oxygen compounds raises serious questions
about the application of all the above equilibrio to
all the alkali metals, This subject is treated by
Brewer? and will not be repeated here. However,
it is the essential point of this treatment to de-
termine whether unsaturated oxygen ions such as
the peroxide and superoxide ions may occur as
decomposition products, in addition to the saturated
oxide ion. The existence of some sort of unsatu-
rated oxygen ion is certain for all the alkali metals,
and it is known that the stability of the unsaturated
species increases in going from lithium to cesium.
Therefore, the basic competition referred to below
between hydrogen and the mono-oxide for water
should be a characteristic of all hydroxide de-
composition equilibria and should lead to a water-
hydrogen equilibrium in the gas phase of the type
discussed. The data for sodium compounds are
reasonobly reliable. Hence, sodium hydroxide will
be treated separately.

The above equations are exact. However, a more
useful form can be obtained by assuming that the
As will be
shown later, this assumption involves a negligible
error for all four reactions. From this assumption
two conclusions can be drawn: (1) the activity of
the hydroxide as used in the above equations may
be taken to be unity because of the choice of
standard states; (2) the partial pressures of water
and hydrogen in the gas phase may be taken to be
equal to the fugacities in the gas phase and hence
equal to the fugacities in the liquid phase. Finally,
by definition, the fugacity of the gases in the
standard reference state is unity. Substituting
these conclusions into the above equations, solving
for the partial pressures, and applying the reaction

From the origina! choice of mole fractions it
may be noted that the above partial pressures are
the decomposition pressures and that there are

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1954

three values of the decomposition pressure with
respect to hydrogen. Except over unique temper-
ature ranges, one of these three decomposition
pressures will be much larger than the other two
and hence, by the law of mass action, will stabilize
the others. Thus, only one of the three pressures
will be the decomposition pressure of MOH with
regard to hydrogen.

Because of the lack of thermodynamic data on
all the alkali-metal hydroxides except sodium, it
is necessary, in most applications, to use ratios
of decomposition pressures... Thus, it is assumed
that reactions 1 and 2 are simultaneously at equi-
librium and that they determine the gaseous water
and hydrogen pressures, respectively. By dividing
Eq. 56 into 5a, the decomposition pressure ratio
becomes

The existence of these equilibria is compatible
with Ee. 6a, as may be seen from the fact that

would have been possible to derive E Eq. 6a by using

evolution from fused sodium hydroxide in an inert
container will be small at all temperatures, but it
should be measurable at 900°C. Likewise, the

There are no satisfactory heat of formation
data for any of the alkali-metal hydroxides other
than those for sodium. Therefore, only the rela-
tive importance of the decomposition equilibria
can be studied. Some of the entropy values for
the higher oxides have been estimated and are
in the literature. However, the heats

are quife uncertain, and it is presently believed
that the accuracy of the AFS and AFS 3 values
given in Table 6.12 would not be improved by
use of these entropy estimates, Therefore, only
enthalpy values will be used, but it will be shown
that this restriction is not so serious as it might
at first seem to be.

The degree of approximation can be checked by
using the data for sodium compounds. In this case
AF , is ~35.5 kcal, when using the approximation,
as compared with the correct value of ~40.7 kcal.
Likewise, AFT 4 is 94.2 kcal compared with the
correct value of ~94.9 kcal. The approximate
values of AFT , and AFq 4 at 25°C are tabulated
in Table 6,12 for all the alkali-metal hydroxides.
Table 6.12 shows that hydrogen and the peroxide
should be produced most readily in potassium hy-
droxide and least readily in lithium hydroxide.
Nevertheless, equilibrium 1 is predominant, ‘and
equilibrium 3 and hence equilibrium 4 are insigni-
ficant,

Various investigations of corrosion and mass

transfer have shown the fundamental role played
by hydrogen. The above computations show that
hydrogen is important in stabilizing sodium hy-

All the dota required in the above equation are
available, except those for the entropy term. Since
this term represents a difference in entropy for two
similar substances, it may be supposed that its
omission will not be serious. A similar situation
obtains for AFS 5. Hence, the following approxi-
mations will be used.

mass transfer becomes significant. These compu-
tations also link the formation of hydrogen with

transfer to occur. As may be seen in Table 6.12,
hydrogen and the unsaturated oxygen ions are most
important for the hydroxides of potassium, rubidium,
and cesium.

Furthermore, these computations provide the first
estimate of the thermal stability of the alkali-metal
hydroxides (other than LiOH). These estimates
confirm the frequently made assumption that the
alkali-metal hydroxides are by far the most thermally
stable hydrogen-containing liquids known.

It must be emphasized that these computations
are given as a progress report in a continuing in-
vestigation. Thus, many of the values obtained,
such as the standard free energies of formation, do
not in themselves provide direct information about
hydroxide corrosion, but they are essential values
for any theoretical investigations of corrosion.

Experimental Studies (with M. E. Steidlitz, Metal-
furgy Division). An investigation is under way fo
determine experimentally whether a significant
amount of hydrogen is liberated when NaOH is
heated to 900°C in an inert environment. The pre-
liminary method being tested is to use a pair of
automatic Toepler pumps fo concentrate any gaseous
products liberated from the hydroxide. The col-
lected gas is analyzed with a mass spectrometer.
The most difficult aspect of this research has been
the endeavor to provide an inert container for the
NaOH, which reacts with all metals studied at
900°C (including the most noble metals) to pro-
duce hydrogen. It reacts strongly with nearly all
ceramics except magnesium oxide. Unfortunately,
nonporous crucibles of pure MgO are not available
because of the difficulty in sintering this material.
Ordinary MgO crucibles, which usually contain a
small amount of binder such as silica, break down
due to attack on the binder. The problem was
solved by machining out large single crystals of
pure magnesium oxide prepared by the Ceramics
Group.

In the experiments which have been performed
to date, appreciable quantities of hydrogen have
been found in addition to much larger quantities of
water, However, there was evidence of contamina-
tion by organic material and the hydrogen may have
come from this source. These studiesare continuing.

there was some evidence that a maximum in the
corrosion could be observed at 800 to 900°C and
that both void formation and chromium concentration
in the melt were less at 1000°C than at 800°C.
While it is possible to rationalize the decreased
void formation on the basis that a high rate of dif-
fusion for chromium in the metal may minimize the
formation of voids, the decreased chromium con-
centration in the melt is, however, more difficult

to explain.

less steel under static and nearly isothermal con-
ditions for 100 hr at 100°C intervals over the range

Inconel. Metallographic examination of the cap-
sules exposed at 600°C revealed light intergranular
penetration up to 1 mil in depth. At 1000°C the
attack was still light, but one isolated case of
intergranular penetration to a depth of 18 mils was
noted. When the chromium concentration of the
melt was plotted against test temperature for the
NaZrFg, a slight maximum in the curve appeared
between 800 and 900°C; a similar plot for the UF ,-
bearing mixture shows a plateau between 700 to
1000°C. However, more chromium appeared in
solution in the NeZrF. samples than in the UF ,-
bearing mixtures. The tendency toward less cor-
rosion at 1000°C than at 800°C never appears to
be pronounced, but it has been sufficiently persistent
in these tests to require explanation.

A plausible explanation can be evolved in the
following manner. The NaZrF, melt which has
been used in these experiments gove rise to ab-
normally high chromium concentrations (1000 ppm)
compared with equilibrium values (200 ppm) ob-
tained in measurements carried out with carefully
handled melts and pure chromium metal. lt appears,
therefore, that impurities were predominantly re-
sponsible for the amounts of corrosion measured.
The most likely impurity is HF, which can result
from hydrolysis of adsorbed water or hydrated water
in salts containing NayZr,F,, or from inadequate
purification.

If HF were responsible, the ascending portion of
the curve could be due to an increasing rate of
reaction with increasing temperature. (There is
little reason to believe that equilibrium conditions
are reached in static capsules in 100 hr.) The
descending portion of the curve may be ascribed to
a marked decrease in corrosiveness of HF at
increasing temperatures.

Standard free energy estimates'? show that AF®
for the reaction of HF with Ni to form NiF , becomes
positive near 500°C, with Fe to form FeF, at
800°C, and with Cr to form CrF, at 1400°C. In
the experiments under discussion here, the melt at
the end of a 100-hr test contains mostly Cr**, with
very little Fe** and Nit",

There is some evidence that at the lower temper-
ature all three elements are attacked rather slowly
and indiscriminately by HF and that the resulting
Fe''* and Ni*' are replaced by Cr*' in a fast
secondary The effect of increasing
temperature is to increase the degree of approach

to equilibrium in 100 hr in a static capsule; how-
ever, at higher temperatures the effect of a more
unfavorable equilibrium constant becomes manifest.
Iron and nickel are relatively unreactive toward HF
at 1000°C, and the amount of Cr pickup in 100 hr
could well be less than that noted at 800°C for
three the free energy change for the
reaction of chromium with HF is smaller, fewer
Fe*' and Ni*" ions are present for reaction with

reasons:

unreacted nickel and iron. In other words, chromiym
is most readily oxidized from an alloy by HF if the
accompanying alloy constituents are alse attacked.

was corrosion tested. Very heavy attack was
observed; this was expected, not becouse normal
amounts of fission products are particularly cor-
rosive but because oxidizing agents such as RuF ,
MoBr,, and elemental tellurium were used in suffi-
cient concentration to cause excessive corrosion
in any case,

Additional experiments were performed with the
use of the same additives, individually, in amounts
as small as possible in an attempt to measure the
relative activities as corrosive agents. Preliminary
results, such as those previously reported which
showed YF, to be extremely corrosive, and oddi-
tional trials during the past quarter, which showed
that such compounds as CsF were also very cor-
rosive, made it obvious that the techniques em-
ployed were unsuitable ond that very misleading
indications were being obtained. Free energy
considerations, as well as general experience with
fluoride systems in closed capsules, make it ap-
parent that impurities such as HF and water were
responsible for the effects noted. Hence it must
be concluded that none of the experiments per-
formed to date on corrosion by simulated fission
products have been satisfactory for the intended
purpose.

Controlled-Velocity Corrosion Testing Apparatus

In order to more nearly simulate corrosion con-
ditions of molten fluorides circulating through
reactor components, a controlled-velocity corrosion
testing apparatus has been constructed. This ap-
paratus, similar to one previously described, '® al-
lows the rapid transfer of molten fluorides through
both heated and cooled test sections. The apparatus
consists of two 4-in.~ID, 24-in.-high Inconel cylin-
drical pots connected by means of three sections of
Vein. inconel tubing with a wall thickness of 0.035
in. The two outside sections are 5 ft long and the
center section, which was initially 1 ft long, was
later increased to 3), ft. The center section is
cooled by either air or water. Suitable furnaces
and heaters permit holding the pots and transfer
lines at desired temperatures, Each Inconel pot
has a gas inlet which allows application of helium

at predetermined pressures to transfer the melt. A
probe indicates when the desired liquid level is
reached in the second pot and activates ua relay
which closes the helium inlet to the first pot and
opens a corresponding one in the second pot to
reverse the cycle,

Velocities obtained with the apparatus have
reached 5 fps, which corresponds to a Reynolds
number of only about 1500. It is hoped that an
improved design now being assembled will make
possible turbulent flow. A 200°C gradient across
the cooling section was desired; however, it has
not yet been possible to achieve a differential of
more than 60°C. The transfer cycle consists in
having the melt contained in either pot at 700°C,
being heated to 800°C in the first section of the
transfer line, cooled in the middle section, brought
back to 700°C in the third section, momentarily
stored in the opposite pot at 700°C, and then the
cycle is reversed. A complete cycle, that is, from
one pot to the other and back, required approxi-
mately 5 min. lt is believed that this apparatus will
yield corrosion data under conditions not easily
obtainable by present means.

Reaction Between Grophite and Fluoride Melt

F. A. Knox
Materials Chemistry Division

Graphite has been used extensively as a con-
tainer material during preparations of fue! and

110

coolant materials; therefore, an investigation was
made of possible reaction between it and a fluoride
melt. ln the procedure used an Inconel reaction
tube was loaded with either NaF-ZrF -UF, (53.5-
40-6.5 mole %) alone or with the fluoride mixture
plus graphite which had been treated under vacuum
for degassing. The reaction tube was connected
to a manometer and then held at 1000°C until the
gas pressure became constant.

It was found that the rather large gas pressures
obtained were due chiefly to SiF,. Analysis of
the graphite indicated the presence of nearly 1%
Si. The use of spectrographically pure graphite in
this apparatus has yielded pressures very nearly
the same as the pressure of the pure fluoride. No
HF or CF, was detected during these tests.

7. METALLURGY

W. D. Manly
Metallurgy Division

Creep and stress-rupture testing have, in the
past, been performed primarily on uniaxially stressed
specimens. ests of this type are continuing, but
the interest is now centered on tube-burst tests in
which a tube that is closed at one end is stressed
with on internal gas pressure. The stress pattern
introduced into the specimen in this test more
nearly approaches the stress pattern that will be
found in ANP-type reactors. The ratio of the tan-
gential stress to the longitudinal stress is quite
important in the ductility of the metal being tested,
and therefore equipment in which the longitudinal
and the tangential stresses can be varied has been
constructed. A theoretical analysis of a stressed
cylindrical pressure vessel has been made with
which a check on the experimental results can be
obtained. Also, to determine the effect of tan-
gential and compressive stresses on the corrosion
rate of metal in contact with fused salts, an ap-
paratus for loading a sheet specimen in bending
was designed and constructed; tests are now being
made.

In the investigation of high-thermal-conductivity
materials for fins for sodium-to-air radiators, stress
rupture and creep tests were made on copper fins
with various types of cladding at stress levels be-
tween 500 and 2000 psi at 1500°F. The tests have
shown that for a 1000-hr exposure in air, stresses
greater than 500 psi and less than 1000 psi are
tolerable; that is, in this stress range there is no
indication of brittieness in the core or oxidation of
the core due to cladding failure. Thermal conduc-
tivity measurements of a 6% Al-94% Cu aluminum
bronze were made in the temperature range 212 to
1562°F.

Tests of brazing alloys have shown that in braz-
ing high-conductivity fin materials te Inconel tubing
there are four alloys that con be used: low-melting-
point Nicrobraz (LMNB), Coast Metals alloy 52,
electroless nickel, and an Ni-P-Cr alloy. From the
over-all considerations of melting point, oxidation
resistance, dilution of fin and tube wall, formation
of low-melting eutectics, and flowability, it was
found that Coast Metals alloy 52 was the best
alloy for the construction of radiators with high-
conductivity fins.

A sodium-te-air radiator with 6 in. of type-430
stainless-steel-clad copper high-conductivity fins
was fabricated by using a combination heliarc
welding and brazing procedure. The tube-to-fin
sections were assembled and brazed with Coast
Metals alloy 52. The tube-to-header joints were
made by using the semiautomatic welding equipment
and then back-brazing. The header sections were
closed by manual heliarc welding.

In the construction of a 100-kw gas-fired liquid-
metal-heater system, packed-rod nozzle assemblies
were needed as the inlets for air and gas. These
devices were made by brazing Yrin.-dia stainless
steel rods in a tight assembly with a ductile,
oxidation-resistant alloy of 82% Au-18% Ni.

Work has started on the formation of duplex tubing
in an attempt to prepare alloy composites that have
good corrosion resistance on the inner surface and
oxidation resistance on the outer surface. Com-
posites of copper and type 310 stainless steel,
Inconel and type 310 stainless steel, Inconel and
Hastelloy B, and Hastelloy B and type 310 stainless
steel have been prepared. Tubing produced from
stainless-steel-clad molybdenum and columbium and
from several special Inconel-type alloys was fabri-
cated into thermal convection loops for fluoride
corrosion testing. Several new alloys were produced
for the corrosion tests with liquid lead.

Attempts are being made to find new alloys in
the nickel-molybdenum system that will have better
high-temperature strength and fluoride corrosion
resistance than Inconel has. Hastelloy B satisfies
these requirements, but it has poor fabrication
properties and oxidation resistance, and it loses
its ductility in the temperature range of interest for
application in high-temperature circulating-fuel re-
actors. Investigations are under way in an effort
to find a suitable melting and heating treatment that
will increase the ductility of Hastelloy B in the
temperature range of interest.

Investigations of methods for producing boron
carbide shield pieces of the required density and
shape indicate that the pieces should be molded
with nonmetallic bonding material by cold pressing
followed by sintering. The bonding materials being

studied include sodium silicate, silica, silicon
nitride, and boric oxide.

The fluoride-to-sodium intermediate heat ex-
changer, which failed in a life test after 1680 hr of
cyclic service in the temperature range 1080 to
1500°F, was examined, It is probable that the
failures in the tube-to-header welds were caused
by unequal thermal expansion, which caused stress
concentration at the roots of the tube-to-header
welds. These stresses, combined with expansion
and contraction of the tubes, would tend to propa-
gate cracks through the walls. These failures
emphasize the extreme desirability of using back-
brazing as o means of minimizing the notch effect
in tube-to-header welds.

STRESS-RUPTURE TESTS OF INCONEL

R. B. Oliver D. A. Douglas
J. H. DeVan J. W. Woods
Metallurgy Division

The tube-burst test for obtaining information on
the stress-rupture properties of Inconel has been
studied intensively. The siress pattern introduced
into the specimen in this test simulates to some
extent the stress pattern that will be present in
circulating-fuel reactors. The test consists of
stressing a closed-end tube with internal gas pres-
sure. In tests of this type reported previously, | it
was observed that Inconel specimens stressed in
this manner showed less ductility and much shorter
rupture life than the uniaxially stressed specimens,
and therefore an intensive study of the multioxial
stress system was initiated. W. Jordan of the
Mechanics Department of the University of Alabama
is investigating this problem.

Part of the investigation consists of a study of
the theory of stresses in cylindrical pressure ves-
sels, with particular attention to the variations in
stresses calculated by the thin-wall formula vs the
stresses determined by the more exact Lamé theory.
The stresses under discussion are those in the
walls only, with no consideration given to the end
closure shape, except that the ends are assumed to
be completely closed. The three principal stresses
at a given point are the radial stress (¢), the tan-
gential (hoop) stress (0), and the longitudinal
(axial) stress (0). The theory of elasticity yields

Equations 9 through 11 are plotted in Fig. 7.1.

The so-called ““exact’’ formulas (often called the
Lamé formulas) are valid only while the stresses
are elastic. The approximate formulas are based
on equilibrium considerations and the assumption
that the stresses are distributed uniformly across
the wall, Under inelastic (including creep) con-
ditions, it is believed that the tangential (hoop)
stress distribution lies somewhere between those
assumed in the Lamé and in the approximate elastic
theories. With increasing stress, increasing temper-
ature, and increasing time, the actual stress dis-
tribution will depart from the Lamé assumption and
approach the thin-wall theory assumption. Thus
the two theories give the upper and lower bounds
for the actual stress distribution.

For the longitudinal (axial) stresses, the Lame
and the thin-wall theories both use the assumption
that the stresses are uniformly distributed over the
cross section. Since the Lome theory uses the
correct value for the cross-sectional area, while
the thin-wall theory uses an approximate area, the
Lamé theory is believed to be more correct in both
the elastic and the inelastic ranges of stress. The
majority of the tube-burst tests made to date have
been of 0.010- and 0.020-in.-wall tubing, and thus
the approximate formula opplies. Specimens are
now being tested which have 0.060-in. walls. Since
it is predicted that under the test conditions the

stress will be uniform across the wall thickness
the approximate formula will be used for calculating
the stresses, and the slight error thus introduced
will be neglected.

It is well known that in the case of a thin-walled
closed-eylinder pressure vessel the ratio of the
tangential (hoop) stress to the longitudinal (axial)
stress is 2:1. Some investigators have shown that
this stress distribution results in the minimum
ductility for a given material. Therefore, in order
to better understond the criteria for predicting
failure of tubular specimens and in order to study
the effects of anisotropy of the tubular material, it
would be desirable to be able to test a series of
specimens with varying stress ratios. Jordan has
devised the apparatus described below with which
it is possible to stress a tubular specimen purely
tangentially, purely axially, or in any desired ratio
of these stresses.

113
ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

The most obvious method of changing the stress
ratio is by loading a tubular specimen axially with
dead weights and producing an axial stress without
the use of pressure, so that o /¢ =0, By using
movable pistons for the ends of the cylinder, as
shown in Fig. 7.2, all the axial load caused by the
pressure acting on the pistons is borne by the rod
connecting the pistons. This will reduce the axial
stress in the cylinder wall to zero (assuming no
friction between piston and cylinder) without af-
fecting the tangential stress. In actual practice,
one piston can be replaced by a fixed end. By
using a piston of larger net area than the opposite
cylinder end, compressive axial stresses can be
introduced into the cylinder walls without altering
the tangential stresses. This arrangement is shown
in Fig. 7.3. By using thin-walled cylinder approxi-
mations, the stress ratio is given by the equation

As before, the stress ratio is independent of the
diameter z of the piston rod. Since the piston rod
is in compression, however, it should be made
large enough to prevent buckling. The bleed lines
shown in Figs. 7.4a and & should be kept open
during testing to assure that no pressure leaks

condition.

There has been considerable speculation as to
the possibility of a difference in the rate of cor-
rosive attack of fused salts in contact with Inconel
under tensile stresses as compared with Inconel in
compression. In order to observe any difference, it
is desirable that the compressive and tensile
stresses be imposed on the same specimen and be
of the same magnitude. One approach to this prob-
lem is to test a specimen under pure bending con-
ditions. This would ensure that the magnitude of
the maximum tensile stress would always be equal
to that of the maximum compressive stress during a
given test. An apparatus which would produce this
effect was also designed by Jordan, and a specimen
is now being tested in a fused salt medium. A
drawing of the specimen and the loading opparatus
is presented in Fig. 7.5. If it is assumed that no

Investigations of Fin Materials

J. H. Coobs H. Inouye
Metallurgy Division

Stress-rupture and creep tests of type-310 stain-
less-steel-clad copper fins that were 8 mils thick
were made at 1500°F at stresses between 500 and
2000 psi. The material was obtained from the
General Plate Div. of Metals & Controls Corp. and
had an average cladding thickness of 1.87 mils per
side. The maximum cladding thickness was 2.3
mils per side. The results of the several fests
made show that some alteration of the copper oc-
curs even though the specimen does not fracture.
This was indicated by the brittleness of the normally
ductile composite. For long-time exposures (1000
hours), stresses greater than 500 psi and less than
1000 psi are tolerable and there is no indication of
brittleness in the core or oxidation due to cladding
failure. In all the specimens which ruptured, oxi-
dation of the copper at the point of fracture was
complete, and the copper which did not appear to
be oxidized was brittle. |t was also noted that
when the strain in 2.5 in. was 10%, the copper re-
mained ductile, while strains above 20% (regardless
of exposure time) produced brittleness. The data
obtained are given in Table 7.1.

The aluminum bronzes are among the materials
being considered as cladding for copper fins. Al-
though extensive diffusion occurs between these
alloys and copper, increases in the thermal con-
ductivity of the fin can be realized by cladding the
copper with these alloys. The composition gradient
existing in a diffused composite results in an in-
crease in the ‘conductivity of the cladding material
{because of the outward diffusion of aluminum) and
a decrease in the conductivity of the copper core.

Thermal conductivity measurements of two alumi-
num bronzes were made by the Solid State Division
and are reported in Table 7.2. The values given
for measurements at temperatures up to 392°F com-
pare favorably with the data of Smith and Palmer, ?
but for temperatures above 392°F they exceed the

Several alloys were investigated for brazing
copper fins clad with Inconel, type 310 stainless
steel, or type 430 stainless steel in order to es-
tablish an optimum combination for fabrication of a
sodium-to-air radiator. The evaluation of these
alloys was based on metallographic examination of
tube-to-fin specimens before and after exposure to
static air for periods up to 600 hr. The alloys
tested are listed in Table 7.3,

wall Inconel tubing with 88% Ni—12% P alloy and
then exposed to static air at 1500°F for 600 hr.
Solution of the tube wall during the brazing cycle
was negligible, but rather severe solution of the
fin lip occurred. It is evident, however, that the
oxidation resistonce of the joint was not affected.
Examinations of specimens brazed with the other
alloys listed in Table 7.3 revealed similar results,
that is, minimum solution of tube walls and ex-
cellent oxidation resistance of the braze joints.

The effects of diffusion, however, were in evi-
dence after each test, Color changes in the copper
core, along with the formation of voids, indicate
that the use of Inconel-clad copper in a radiator
would not be advisable, since the void formation

ond the change in core chemistry from copper to a
copper-nickel alloy would seriously reduce the heat
transfer efficiency of the fin. Other claddings, such
as types 310 and 430 stainless steel, have been
found to be relatively immune to diffusion effects,
however, and a number of brazed joints were evalu-
ated to determine the optimum alloy for brazing each
of these materials to Inconel tubing.

A joint of type-310 stainless-steel-clad copper
brazed to Inconel tubing with the 88% Ni-12% P
alloy is shown in Fig. 7.7. It may be seen that fin
dilution and intergranular penetration of the resulting
brazing alloy into the tube wall occurred. This
penetration, undetected in the case of Inconel-clad
copper, appears to be due to the formation of a
complex eutectic resulting from the presence of an
iron-base cladding material rather than from a
nickel-base material. Similar intergranular pene-
tration was found when the 88% Ni-12% P alloy

os shown in Fig. 7.8. In this case, the intergranular
penetration was completely through the tube wall.
The effect of the intergranular penetration on the
physical properties of the tubing has not yet been
determined, but it is believed that it would be ad-
visable to use a brazing alloy that does not react
with the iron-base cladding material,

A negligible amount of dilution and a relatively
minor amount of boron diffusion into the Inconel
tubing occurred.

Although low-melting-point Nicrobraz (LMNB) has

been used successfully to braze all the proposed
cladding materials to Inconel, its relatively high

flow point of 1925°F is so close to the melting
point of copper that it cannot be used with ease.
Since the oxidation resistance of the Coast Metals
alloy 52 is comparable to that of LMNB and the
effect of boron diffusion is the same for both alloys,
the Coast Metals alloy was selected for the fabri-
cation of the first high-conductivity-fin sodium-to-air
radiator.

The problem of edge protection of the clad copper
fins has been resolved. Aluminum is opplied to the
edges of fins by dip coating or spraying, or: it is
painted on as aluminum powder in a Nicrobraz
cement slurry. The fin is then heated at 800°C for
approximately Y hr. The diffusion of the aluminum
into the copper core results in an aluminum bronze
which exhibits excellent resistance to oxidation
when exposed to static air for 500 hr at 1500°F,
It appears that the depth of bronzing, which con-
tinues during oxidation testing, is about a to %
in. in 500 hr. The feasibility of simultaneously
bronzing large numbers of fins is to be determined.

A sodium-to-air radiator with 6 in. of type-430
stainless-steel-clad copper fins was fabricated by
using a combination heliarc welding and brazing
procedure. The tube-to-fin section was assembled
and brazed with Coast Metals alloy 52 at 1020°C.
The split headers were then assembled and heliarc
welded by using the semiautomatic equipment
available in the Welding Laboratory. A photograph
of the radiator and welding torch after the welding
of the 108 tube-to-header joints is shown in Fig.
7.11.

The remaining header sections were then manually
heliorc welded by utilizing the complete penetration
technique. Although a pressure test indicated that
six tube-to-header joints were not leak-tight, a

bock-brazing operation satisfactorily sealed the
leaks andremoved the effects of notches as sources
of stress concentrations. The completed unit, as
shown in Fig. 7.12, was helium leak-tight after the

One of the design features of the 100-kw gas-fired,
liquid-metal-heater system now being constructed is
the packed-rod nozzle assembly to be used for inlet
control of the air and the gas flow. Test data and
theoretical considerations indicated that Yin.-dia

satisfactory for use in this nozzle. It was expected
that these rods could be joined in a rigid bundle

with a minimum of plugged interstices by furnace
brazing with a ductile oxidation-resistant high-
temperature brazing alloy such as 82% Au-18% Ni.

Experiments revealed that proper jigging was
extremely important in obtaining the completed air-
nozzle blank (Fig. 7.13). Each layer of rods was
tack-welded for rigidity, ond the layers were then
tack-welded to form the assembly. Since the de-
termination of the exact amount of brazing alloy
required was difficult, if not impossible, sufficient
material was used to ensure good bonding at all
capillary joints. The excess material was then
removed from the nozzle interstices by placing a
flat cross section against a metal sheet on which

these fine scratches acted as capillaries and the
excess material was removed.

The design of the natural-gas nozzle specified
that o regular pattern of interstices should be
selectively closed. The closures were obtained by
inserting wires into the designated holes and brazing
them to the rods.

using threaded molybdenum joints, which were then
protected from oxidation by the use of welded cover
plotes. Both loops failed early in corrosion tests
because of fracture of the cover plates and leakage

from the joints.

It is believed that overheating of the cover plates
occurred while the loops were being initially heated
by electrical resistance. Since no metallurgical
bond existed between the molybdenum and the
cladding, separation became more pronounced with
increased temperature, until finally all the current
was being carried by the rather thin cover plates,

Future molybdenum thermal-convection loops will
be made from arc-melted molybdenum, which is
weldable, and the heavy nickel electrodes required
for resistance heating will be welded directly to
the molybdenum tube instead of to the cladding.

Columbium clad with type 310 stainless stee! has
been fabricated into a thermal-convection loop by
heliarc welding in air. This loop will be tested as
soon as the accessory parts are available.

Inconel-Type Alloys

Eight thermal-convection loops of Inconel-type
alloys were fabricated, The compositions and room
temperature properties of the olloys are given in
Table 7.4. The alloys are being studied as a part
of the effort to obtain alloys with better high-
temperature corrosion resistance than that of Inconel.

difficulties have been encountered in attempts to
fabricate this material. In castings and in fusion
welds, a whole range of composition results becouse
of severe coring during freezing, and thus the
properties of the fabricated specimen vary from one
Even long-time high-temperature

aging treatments of such material will not produce

area to another,

an equilibrium structure. The aging treatment also
results in a great increase in hardness with a
corresponding decrease in ductility. At temperatures
between 1200 and 1800°F, the wrought material
exhibits its poorest ductility because of hot short-
ness, which can arise from trace impurities or the
precipitation of an age-hardening constituent, which
is probably the case for Hastelloy B. Thus the
temperature range of poorest ductility of Hastelloy
B coincides with the temperature range of con-
templated use in high-temperature circulating-fuel
reactors, Hastelloy B is not recommended for use

in air at temperatures above 1400°F because of
excessive oxidation. A potential source of trouble
exists because of the molybdenum content; molybde-
num oxide hos been reported to cause catastrophic
oxidation of surrounding structures, especially the
steels.

The solutions to these problems are being ap-
proached in two major ways. First, attempts are
being made to find suitable melting and heating
treatments of Hastelloy B that will reduce the
degree of age hardening so that both the cast and
wrought materials will possess acceptable properties
in the temperature range of interest, Second,
Hastelloy-type alloys are being studied. Both
phases of the investigation will involve attempts to
extrude seamless tubing, since, at present, Hastelloy
B tubing must be made by welding strips. Aging
studies of the following materials are now in prog-
ress at temperatures between 1200 and 1700°F:
commercial, wrought, Hastelloy B plate; vacuum-
melted Hastelloy B, as cast; cast and wrought 20%
Mo—80% Ni alloy; wrought 24% Mo-76% Ni alloy.

Some of the properties of the 20% Mo-80% Ni
alloy already obtained indicate that this alloy will
be easier to fabricate than Hastelloy B from ‘an
extrusion standpoint; sound tubing could be made,
whereas none was obtained from Hastelloy B.

The recrystallization temperature of a 60% cold-
worked sheet of the 20% Mo-80% Ni alloy was ap-
proximately 1900°F for an annealing time of 30
min. . However, this alloy oxidizes in air at 1500°F
at a faster rate than does Hastelloy B, although
under a temperature cycle between room temperature
and 1500°F the oxidation rates are similar. The
scale formed spalls near room temperature. A
sheet, 0.065 in. thick, could be heliarc welded
without producing porosity, but an argon arc pro-
duced porosity. In strength tests at 1500°F, the
20% Mo~80% Ni alloy had a rupture life of 90 hr of
8000 psi; when tested at 5000 psi for 600 hr, it had
a 3% elongation; during a short-time test the alloy
had atensile strength of 40,000 psi and an elongation
of 10% in a 2-in. gage length.

Oxidation and oxidation-protection studies are in
progress to find suitable methods of protecting the
nickel-molybdenum-base alloys during tests in ther-
mal- convection loops and creep-testing apparatus.
This work will be the ground work for further studies
of the protection of reactor components. The coat-
ings being studied are those that can be applied by
methods readily available, that is, chromium electro-
plate, chromium plus nickel electroplate, nickel

plus aluminum spray, and aluminum spray. In
constant-temperature tests, g chromium electroplate
was found to be beneficial. In oxidation tests in.
volving cycling between room temperature and
1500°F, these coatings eliminate the spalling
characteristics of Hastelloy B. The chromium elec-
troplate and the chromium plus nickel electroplate
afford the best protection.

Duplex Tubing

Attempts have been made to fabricate duplex
seamless tubing that will have good corrosion
resistance on the inner surface ond oxidation
resistance on the outer surface. In the first ex
periments, attempts were made to deep draw duplex
blanks 4 in, in diameter. The blanks were made by
hot pressing and also by hot rolling. The following
materials were combined by hot pressing 0.025-in.-
thick sheets under an argon atmosphere with Al,O,-
coated graphite dies at 1500 psi.

Copper was also combined with type 310 stainless
steel by hot rolling at 1000°C. For this, a three-ply
composite with copper in the center and cover plates
of the stainless steel was used. One of the cover
plates was oxidized at 1100°C for 2 hr to prevent
bonding during rolling.

Included in these experiments were some tests
involving the fabrication of composites of molybde-
num and Inconel. The purposes of these tests were
to determine the conditions necessary to obtain a
metallurgical bond by hot rolling, to determine the
extent of directional properties due to the molybde-
num, and to determine whether such a combination
could be deep drawn. The first rolling experiments
were made on an evacuated capsule at 1225°C with
reductions of 10% per pass. The total reduction was
79% in thickness. No bonding was obtained by
using nickel as an intermediate layer between the

123
ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

Inconel and the molybdenum. In a second series of
experiments the rolling temperature was reduced to
1000°C, with reductions of 40% per pass and a
total reduction of 85% in thickness, The lower
rolling temperature reduced the tendency for inter-
metallic compounds to form at the interface. Bonding
wos achieved by using nickel as the intermediate
layer, and evidences of intermetallic compounds
were found only by metallographic examination at
high magnifications. The final thickness of the
composite was 0.010 in. of molybdenum on 0.040 in,
In future experiments with this com-
bination, the maximum ratio of molybdenum to Inconel
without the directional properties of wrought
molybdenum will be determined.

All the composites mentioned above were suc-
cessfully reduced from 4-in. blanks to 2)-in cups

Sigma-Phase Alloys

For the continuing study of sigma-phase alloy
corrosion by liquid lead (cf. Sec. 6, ‘‘Corrosion
Research’’), some additional tubing was made. Two
ingots of a 48.2% Cr—51.8% Fe alloy and two ingots
of o 45% Fe-40% Cr-15% Ni dloy were vacuum
cast info 1) -in.-dia ingots 6 in. long. These ingots
were then hot rolled in an air atmosphere at 1250°C
to rod % in. in diameter. After annealing at 1100°C
for 2 hr and quenching, the rod was readily machin-
able into tubing.

The transformation from the ferrite to the sigma
phose will be accomplished by aging at 1425°F,
Two of the tubes (Fe-Cr) were cold swaged 12% so
that the effect of cold swaging on the distribution
of the sigma phase could be determined.

Boron Carbide Shielding

The experimental fabrication of %-in.-thick shield
pieces by warm pressing boron carbide bonded with
copper or silver has been discontinued in favor of
the fabrication of pieces molded with nonmetallic
bonding material by cold pressing followed by
sintering to develop the desired properties. Non-
metallic bonding materials that would be suitable
from nuclear considerations and would be stable at
the expected service temperature include sodium
silicate, silica, silicon nitride, and boric oxide.
Arrangements are being made to secure samples of
these materials for compatibility tests with Inconel
under operating conditions.

124

The density of the proposed shield pieces is to
be about 1.8 to 1.9 g/cm? of B,C, equivalent to 1.4
to 1.5 g/cm? of boron. They would be molded in
the form of equilateral triangles or diamond shapes,
2 to 3 in. on a side, so as to cover a sphere with
an integral number of pieces,

Additional tests of the compatibility of Inconel
with pure boron carbide are being made. Previous
tests indicated the formation of a diffusion layer
5 mils thick in a 100-hr test at the operating temper-
ature of 1500°F,

Tubular Fuel Elements

Twelve tubular fuel elements are being prepured
for further drowing experiments at Superior Tube
Company. They are being assembled with high-
fired UO, in.the 30- to 55-p particle size range, as
well as with very fine UO,, and with prealloyed
and elemental stainless steel and iron core matrixes.

Plans are also being made to try hot swaging of
the tubes in an attempt to reduce stringer formation
in the cores by reducing the amount of cold working.
Hot swaging on a mandrel may prove to be suc-
cessful if bonding to the mandrel can be prevented
by an oxide scale or coating.

Metallurgy Division

The fluoride-to-sodium intermediate heat ex-
changer, which in a life test failed after 1680 hr in
cyclic service in the temperature range 1080 to
1500°F, was examined metallographically. All the
tube-to-header joints were manually heliarc welded,
and tests showed the heat exchanger to be helium
leak-tight before assembly into the test rig.

Visual examination indicated the presence of 19
fissures in the tube-to-header welds in two of the
three adjacent headers at the hot sodium inlet end.
The probable progressive propagation of these
fissures is shown in Figs. 7.14, 7.15, and 7.16.
The fissure shown in Fig. 7.16 probably extends to
the surface of the weld. If so, there was a leak in
the system at this point. lt seems likely that dif-
ferential thermal expansion between the tubes and
the casing caused stress concentrations at the
roots of the tube-to-header welds,
concentrations

These stress
would tend to propagate cracks
through the welds in the course of thermal cycling,

The enthalpies and heat capacities of NaF-ZrF -
UF, (65-15-20 mole %) were determined; the heat
capacity in the solid state over the temperature
range 90 to 614°C was found to be 0.17 cal/g-°C,
and the heat capacity in the liquid state over the
temperature range 653 to 924°C was found to be
0.20 cal/g.°C. The enthalpies and heat capacities
of LiF-NaF-UF (57.6-38.4-4.0 mole %) were also
obtained; the heat capacity in the solid state over
the temperature range 97 to 594°C was found to
be 0.23 cal/g-°C, and in the liquid state over the
range 655 to 916°C it was found to be 0.53
cal/g-°C. The thermal conductivities of three
fluoride mixtures in the solid state af normal
temperatures were determined. The conductivity
of NaF-KF-UF, (46.5-26.0-27.5 mole %) was 0.7
Btu/hr-ft2 (°F /ft), that for KF-LiF-NaF-UF , (43.5-
44.5-10.9-1.1 mole %) was 2.0 Btu/hr-ft2 (°F /f1),
and that for LiF-KF-UF  (48.0-48.0-4.0 mole %)
was 1.4 Biu/hr-ft2 (°F/ft). A new electrical con-
ductivity device has been constructed and has
been successfully checked with molten salts of
known conductivity.

Additional forced-convection heat transfer meas-
urements of molten NaF-KF-LiF (11.5-42.0-46.5
mole %) have been made. Measured thermal con-
ductivities and thicknesses of insoluble deposits
on the inner walls of Inconel heat transfer tubes
made it possible to calculate the thermal re-
sistance of the deposit. The calculated value was
in good agreement with values previously deduced
from the heat transfer measurements. A device
for studying the rates of growth of tube-wall de-
posits has been successfully tested with a simple
heat transfer salt. A hydrodynamic flow system
to be used for studying the reflector-moderated
reactor flow structure has been tested. A mathe-
matical study of the temperature structure in con-
verging and diverging channel systems that duct
fluids with volume heat sources has been made.
A study of wall-cooling requirements in circu-
lating-fuel reactors was made.

Automatic Simplytrol units have been added to

produced by the Stable Isotope Research and Pro-
duction Division by reduction of a high quality
fluoride which was prepared by the CRSORT group
from RbF furnished by the Materials Chemistry
Division.

In order to obtain more accurate viscosity data
it was decided to initiate a program of refining
viscometry techniques. In particular, the influence
of fluid density on calibrations of both the ro-
tational and the capillary devices is being studied.
Easily handled fused salts are being used as
calibrating fluids. The present studies indicate
that some of the old calibration curves, which were
based on low-density calibrating liquids, were
shifted by about 30%. This means that some of
the previously reported viscosity measurements are
about 30% high.

Because of significant improvements made in
fluoride preparation ond handling, the mixtures
which are now being obtained from the Materials
Chemistry Division are extremely pure, and they
no longer cause the difficuities encountered in the
early stages of the project, such as fouling of
equipment and variations in physical character-
istics. No doubt some of the earlier viscosity
measurements were high because of the impurities
in the materials.

Thermal Conductivity

The thermal conductivities of three solid fluoride
mixtures at normol temperatures were determined
by the transient cooling technique:

LiF-KF-UF , (48.0-48.0-4.0 1.4

The thermal conductivity of solid LiF-KF-UF,
(48.0-48.0-4.0 mole %) was measured by the steady-
state flat-plate technique; a value of 1.5 Btu/hr.ft2
(°F /ft) was obtained. The ratios of corresponding
liquid to solid thermal conductivity measurements
for the fluoride mixtures studied to date are near
unity.

Electrical Conductivity
N. D. Greene

Reactor Experimental Engineering Division

The experimental current-potential conductivity
cell has been successfully tested and stand-
ardized. The electrical conductivity of a KNO,
melt was determined to within a few per cent of
the values reported in the literature.

As predicted, the effects of polarization within
this cell were greatly reduced by the use of the
alternate method.® This reduction in the effect

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1954

of polarization was further substantiated by the
small observable increase of conductivity with
frequency in contrast to the usual large depend-
ence of conductivity upon frequency, as observed
in the low-resistance conductivity cell. The
measurements on KNO, were obtained during a
single run without the necessity of having to
replatinize the electrodes after each determination.
A refinement of this current-potential cell which
will permit measurements of greater accuracy is
now under way.

Preliminary measurements of several fluorides,
the conductivities of which were determined previ-
ously by an alternate method, were found to be in
good agreement within the inherent limitations of
accuracy. A summary of the preliminary measure-
ments of the conductivities of KF-LiF-NaF-UF,
(43.5-44.5-10.9-1.1 mole %), NaF-ZcF ,-UF, (50.0-

several other salts, has been compiled in a sepa-
rate report.

FUSED-SALT HEAT TRANSFER

Additional data for NaF-KF-LiF (11.5-42.0-46.5
mole %) flowing for short-time periods in an elec-
trically heated type 316 stainless steel tube have
been analyzed. The results are in agreement with
the general turbulent flow correlations for ordinary
fluids.

The thermal conductivity of K,CrF was found
to be 0.13 Btu/hr-ft2 (°F/f)? in the temperature
range 100 to 200°F. Measurements from a photo-
micrograph, Fig. 8.2, of a section of the tube used
in the Inconel experiment show a film thickness
of about 0.4 mil. The thermal resistance colcu-
lated from these results, 0.00025 hr.f12.°F /Btu, is
in agreement with the measured thermal resistance
obtained from the heat transfer experiments in the
Inconel system.

Construction of the equipment for generation of
power surges by electrical means in aluminum fila-
ments has been completed, and the entire experi-
mental apparatus has been assembled and tested.
Satisfactory operation has been achieved. The
transient-power generator consists of 100 thy-
ratrons connected in parallel. A different bias
can be put on the grid of each thyratron, and the
system can be set so that a signal of increasing
voltage applied simultaneously to all tubes fires
them in a sequence that approximates the desired
function. A peak current of about 500 amp can be
produced, with the duration of the power surge
ranging from 30 to 500 msec.

The instantaneous values of voltage drop across
the test filament and current through it are re-
corded by a fast-response Hathaway oscillograph.
A Fastax high-speed motion picture camera is
used to photograph the event, and illumination is
supplied by an Edgerton stroboscopic flash unit
synchronized with the camera. A repetition rate
of 6000 frames per second is obtainable with a
fiash duration of 2 usec. Closing a single switch
initiates the operation of all the equipment; a time
delay is provided in which the camera can ac-
celerate to full speed before current is passed
through the filament.

FLUID FLOW STUDIES FOR CIRCULATING-
FUEL REACTORS

J. O. Bradfute L. D. Palmer
F. E. Lynch

Reactor Experimental Engineering Division

The flow system for the hydrodynamic studies of
the reflector-moderated reactor core, shown sche-
matically in Fig. 8.3, has been fabricated, as-
sembled, and tested. A detailed sketch of the test
section is also shown in Fig. 8.3. Since it will
be necessary to insert, photograph, and then re-
move a coordinate grid from time to time, the
system was designed so that it could be readily
assembled and disassembled. The cores are po-
sitioned and supported by a brass sleeve, which
was attached to the test section support along its
center line before it was machined. The sleeve
was carefully bored and lapped so that the shafts
protruding downward from the cores would fit with
minimum clearance and yet loosely enough so that
they could be removed by hand. The upper surface
of the test section support flange was machined
perpendicular to the center line of the brass
sleeve. This arrangement permits accurate align-
ment of the core within the Plexiglas test section
without supporting members in or chead of the test
region. Attempts are currently being made to
obtain some preliminary fluid flow information for
the reflector-moderated reactor core for the straight
entrance condition shown in Fig. 8.3 by photo-
graphing particle flow through the Plexiglas test
section.

The phosphorescent flow-visualization system,
which was described previously,!! has been further
modified. The ZnCd sulfide phosphor has been
replaced by a ZnS (Cu-activated) phosphor whose
luminosity was found to be greater after excitation.
The duct work in the flow circuit has been im-

proved so that higher Reynolds numbers are now
attainable, and a diverging Lucite channel has
been constructed. Some of the flow features, such
as asymmetry, flow separation, and the effect of
entrance lengths, are to be observed for different
entrance configurations in such channel systems.
The phosphorescent flow-visualization method is
also to be used in the reflector-moderated reactor
core experiment.

HEAT TRANSFER STUDIES FOR CIRCULATING-
FUEL REACTORS

H. F. Poppendiek L. D. Palmer

Reactor Experimental Engineering Division

The classical hydrodynamics study, conducted
by Nikuradse,'? of converging and diverging
channels was reviewed. It is felt that some of
the fundamental flow features observed in con-
verging and diverging channel systems will also
exist in the reflector-moderated reactor. The
results obtained by Nikuradse indicate that for
the cose of turbulent flow in convergent channels
the flow becomes more stable or less turbulent in
nature and that the eddy diffusivities are signifi-
cantly lower than in a pardllel-plate channel
system. For the case of turbulent, symmetrical
flow in diverging channels the tlow is found to
be more turbulent than in the parallel-plate system.
When the total channel angle of a divergent system
is increased beyond 8 deg, asymmetrical flow re-
sults. For a 10-deg angle, a thin, low-velocity
layer of fluid flowing in a reverse direction to the
main stream is noted near one of the channel
walls. This separation phenomenon becomes more
pronounced at larger channel angles.

Some radial temperature distributions were calcu-
lated in the established-flow region of a few con-
verging and diverging flow channel systems con-
taining volume heat sources within the ducted
fluid. The experimental velocity and eddy dif-
fusivity data obtoined by Nikuradse were used in
the analyses. The results indicated that wall-fluid
temperature differences can be significantly higher
in converging flow channels than in parallel-plate
systems; the converse is frue for symmetrical
diverging flow channels. Asymmetrical divergent
flow passages are difficult to analyze at this time
because the diffusivity structure is not known.

However, it appears reasonable to conclude that
high temperatures probably would exist in the thin,
low-velocity layer of fluid in the 10-deg divergent

in nature.

This is in contrast to the capsules containing
UF 4-bearing fuel in which minor increases in

irradiated specimens as compared with the out-of.
However, it should be emphasized
that even in the UF  -bearing capsules, the ap-
pearance of small deviations from the controls
could be due to experimental difficulties.

Inspection of the previously described LITR in-
pile circulating-fuel loop, which failed prior to the
startup, disclosed that the failure was caused by a

pile controls.

Design revisions and
refabrication of some components are in progress.
Developmental work continued on a smaller loop
for operation in an LITR A-piece. Work on a loop
for insertion in the MTR is described in Sec. 3,
‘Experimental Reactor Engineering."

Development of equipment continued for in-pile
stress-corrosion tests on Inconel in contact with
fluoride mixtures, and testing of the MTR tensile-
creep rig neared completion. Detailed examination
was completed of an Inconel loop in which sodium
was circulated at high temperature in the ORNL
Graphite Reactor, and no evidence of radiation-
induced corrosion was found in the Inconel.

Metallographic examinations were carried out in
the hot cells on irradiated fuel plates for the
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Division, and studies were
made on annealing.out of fission-fragment damage.
Work continued on examination of wire and multiple-
plate type units for GE-ANP,

MTR STATIC CORROSION TESTS

VW. E. Browning G. W. Keilholtz
Solid State Division

A new series of capsules was irradiated in the
MTR to compare NaF-ZrF, fuels containing UF,
with those containing UF,. The property to be
compared is the effect of fission on static core

134

rosion of Incone! by the fuels aot 1500°F. The
series includes five capsules containing 1.79

mole % UF,, 49.3 mole % ZrF,, and 48.9 mole %

NaF and five capsules containing 1.74 mole %

UF,, 48.2 mole % Zrf,, and 50.1 mole % NaF.
Analyses are being run to confirm the purity of the
UF; with respect to UF, contamination. For
every capsule, there will be an out-of-pile control
capsule. Each fuel generates 1100 w/cm? in the
A-38 position in the MTR.

Six capsules have been irradiated for the speci-
fied two-week period. Five have been received
at ORNL. after irradiation; three of them have been
opened and two have been examined ~ one con-
taining UF 5 and one containing UF ;. Bothcapsules
had been irradiated with the metal-liquid interface
at 1500 + 50°F. The UF j-bearing capsule had
experienced one temperature excursion to 1660 +
50°F for less than 30 sec, but the temperature of
the UF ,-bearing capsule never exceeded 1550 +
50°F. The fuel in each capsule was frozen two or
three times during its history. No evidence of
corrosion or film could be seen in the UF ;-bearing
Inconel capsule. There was subsurface void
formation in the UF ,-bearing Inconel capsule to a
depth of about 2 mils. No intergranular corrosion
or concentration of voids at the grain boundaries
was evident,

Analytical samples of the irradiated fuel were
taken with two sizes of drills. The uranium concen-
trations in the central and outer samples were
identical, within experimental error (+3%), and were
of the value expected after burnup correction.
Analyses for iron, chromium, and nickel gave the
following results: Fe, 0.03 to 0.14 wt %; Ni, 0.01
to 0.05 wt %; Cr, less than 107% wt %. There were
no significant differences in the final iron, nickel,
and chromium compositions between the two cap-
sules. Analyses of the unirradiated fuels have
not been completed.

It would be unwise to draw conclusions on the
basis of only one pair of samples; however, if
these first results are confirmed in future capsules,
UF, fuels may be considered quite desirable as
far as radiation-induced corrosion is concerned.
Two UF ;-bearing capsules and two UF ;-bearing
capsules in this series will be irradiated for six
weeks each to amplify the apparent differences in
the effects of UF, and UF, on Inconel. It is inter-
esting to note that the UF, capsule in this series is
the first one run in the MTR and the first one run at
800 w/cm? or greater that has not shown a tendency
toward intergranular corrosion. - Whether the differ-
ence between eorlier UF j-bearing capsules and
the one in this series is due to improved temper-
ature control or to uranium concentration effects
will be determined by additional irradiations.

FISSION PRODUCT CORROSION STUDY

C. C. Webster G. W. Keilholtz
Solid State Division

Steps are being taken to perform corrosion tests
out-of-pile with irradiated fuel in order to separately
study the effects on Inconel of fission-product
concentration and of Inconel irradiation.

A water-cooled facility for irradiation of solid
fuel was constructed and has been installed in
position C-46 of the LITR. The unperturbed
thermal flux is on the order of 4 x 10'3, An Inconel
tube has been constructed for casting solid bars
of fuel 1 in, long and 0.1 in. in diameter. The
solid bars of fuel will be transferred to Inconel
capsules for irradiation. The capsule has been
constructed so that it can be welded shut without
the bars being melted and can be reopened in the
hot cell for transfer of the fuel to the corrosion
test capsule.

Upon completion of an out-of-pile heating cycle,
the test capsule will be opened in the hot cell.
The fuel will be drilled out and divided into three
samples: a portion for petrographic study to detect
any oxidation or reduction, a portion for mass
spectrographic study to determine burnup, and
a portion for chemical analysis of the fuel. The
capsule will be slit on the remote slitting machine
described below for a metallographic study. At
least two concentric samples can be taken from a
capsule of this size by remote means.

FACILITIES FOR HANDLING IRRADIATED
CAPSULES

C. C. Webster G. W. Keilholtz
Solid State Division

It was observed metallographically, in some
cases, that when several transverse sections

were taken from a single fluoride fuel corrosion

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1954

capsule the corrosion pattern was not consistent
over the length of the capsule but appeared to be a
function of the longitudinal temperature gradient.
One method of obtaining a longitudinal section
would be to grind away half of the capsule on the
milling machine. However, by such a method it
would be difficult to ascertain that a section
through the diameter of the capsule had been made.
Also, the milling operation would create a serious
contamination problem.

The method being used consists in passing the
capsule longitudinally by a 10-mil-thick silicon
carbide fine-grit wheel and thus slitting the cap-
sule down the center. The copsule is clamped
into a vise and then fed into the wheel by means of
a mechanical linkage which is to be replaced by a
variable-speed motor and a contact cutoff switch.
When the capsule is put into the gripping adapter
in the vise, it is automatically aligned so that the
wheel will cut in the plane of a diameter through
the capsule. By making different gripping adapters,
various sizes of tube can be slit lengthwise. Thus
far the apparatus has been used on only MTR-type
fluoride fuel capsules (0.100«in.-ID and 0.200-in.-
OD); it has worked very satisfactorily.

Since the abrasive wheel has a rubber base, it
must be kept cool. The area around the cut must
also be kept cool to prevent any high thermal
stresses from affecting the corrosion results. The
wheel and specimen are over a tray and are covered
with a splash shield so that a liquid coolant can
be used. The coolant level is always kept above
the bottom edge of the abrasive wheel so that by
cutting upward into the specimen the coolant is
carried into the cut; therefore the specimen need
not be in the coolant. Carbon tetrachloride is
used as the coolant because it does not react with
the fluoride fuel at high temperatures. It is forced
into the tray from outside ‘the hot cell through
Tygon tubing by air pressure. The tray and splash
shield are attached to the mount for the vise and
they move with the specimen.

Once installed within the hot cell, the remotely
operated tube-slitting machine can be used with
ease in cutting longitudinal sections from various
sizes of tubing. Thicker abrasive wheels can be
used for heavier walled tubing. The advantages of
this method of cutting are that it permits visual
observation of the amount of fuel left on the tube
walls, it permits observation of constrictions
without the necessity of removing or disturbing the

ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

material causing the trouble, it gives a well-exposed
surface for chemically removing the last traces of
fuel, it permits a cut to he made through the bottom
plug of the capsule so that an examination can be
made for crevice corrosion, and it leaves nearly
one half of the capsule for further and more com-
plete study, if desired. After the fuel is removed
chemically without attacking the metal wall, the
specimen can be electroplated so that the fuel-
interface will not be rounded during the
metallographic polishing operation.

The stability of the fluoride fuel under irradiation
and the extent of the corrosion of the container by
the fuel are determined, in part, by analyzing
samples of the irradiated fuel for the concentration

reduce personnel exposure.

Two transfer carriers weighing 150 Ib each and
giving 2 in. of lead shielding have been constructed
and are now in use. Each carrier holds four 30-ml
bottles that are held in place by spring clamps.
A motor-driven decapper for removing the bottle
cap and a remotely controlled pipet that can be
lowered info the bottle are provided. The bottles
may be inserted into the carrier within the cells
and can be left in the carrier during all sample
removal operations. The whole unit may then be
returned to the hot cells for reuse.

Two lead storage units weighing 450 |b each and
giving 3 in. of lead shielding were also built and
are available for use when all the transfer carriers
are in use. The lead storage units have a capacity
of four 50-ml volumetric flasks and can be loaded
within the master-slave cells.

LIFE TESTS OM AN RPM METER, BEARINGS,
AND A SMALL ELECTRIC MOTOR UNDER
IRRADIATION

J. G. Morgan H. E. Robertson
G. W. Keilholtz
Solid State Division

Tests were conducted on an RPM meter, bearings,
and a small electric motor as a part of the de-
velopment of a loop for insertion in an LITR A-
piece. In order to drive the pump, it is desirable
to use a variable-speed electric moter and to align
the shaft with lubricated bearings. Also, a record
of shaft speed would be desirable. The entire
motor assembly will be just above the upper grid
guide in the LITR and in an estimated thermal
flux of 5 x 10! neutrons/cm?-sec. Hole 53 of the
ORNL Grophite Reactor provided a comparable flux
intensity and was used for these tests,

The in-pile apparatus, with a single lower bearing
as in the second test, is shown in Fig. 9.3. A
motor was mounted in ag horizontal position with
upper ond lower armature shaft bearings. In the
first test two lower bearings were used. The motor
and RPM meter were canned and inserted into
the center line of the reactor. The variables
measured were resistance of the motor winding,
resistance of the RPM coil, the voltage applied
to the motor, the current drawn by the moter, the
temperature of the lower Fafnir bearing, the temper-
ature of the motor field, and the speed of the motor
shaft.

The Delco ac-dc motor used is rated at 115 v,
0.9 amp, and Ys hp and has insulated wires. Some

A loop for circulating fluoride fuel was inserted
in hole HB-2 of the LITR and filled with fluoride
fuel NaF-ZrF -UF, (62.5-12.5-25 mole %) during a
protracted reactor shutdown, The pump was started
as soon as sufficient fuel ‘had been added, but
circulation of the fluoride mixture became erratic
after 5 to 10 min and finally stopped completely.
Fluoride fumes in the off-gas line from the jacket
around the pump indicated a leak,® and therefore
the loop was removed before the reactor was started.

The loop was carefully disassembled to avoid
loss of uranium, since over 5 kg of enriched fuel
mixture had been used to charge the loop. Recovery
of the fuel from the “‘nosepiece’’ at the in-pile
end of the loop had to be carried out in a hot cell
because of neutron activation acquired when: the
unfilled loop was exposed to reactor flux before
the fuel was added. The lsak was found in the
weld joining the loop tubing to the discharge nipple
ot the bottom of the pump bowl. Complete breaking
of the weld occurred probably during disassembly
of the loop or during cutting of the pump jacket,
rather than while the pump was in operation,

Before insertion in the reactor the jacket for
enclosing the loop and the pump in an inert atmos-
phere was tested for gas tightness. The loop,
with the pump superstructure replaced by a blank
flange, was vacuum tested at 800 to 1000°F with
a helium leak detector. After the loop was inserted
in the reactor, it was pressure tested at 1200 to
1500°F at 16 psig, and there was no perceptible
loss in pressure over a l-hr period, even though
the pump superstructure with its rotating shaft seal
was in place.

ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

The connections of the loop tubing at the pump
have been redesigned for the second loop to provide
a filling and drain line. This will permit charging
the loop with a non-uranium-bearing fluoride mixture,
circulating it at operating temperature, and draining
it before the loop is inserted into the reactor. The
danger of tube rupture because of expansion of the
fuel on melting necessitates the draining and
refilling feature, if operating tests are to be carried
out. The necessary changes in the pump shield
to accommodate the drain and fill line are being
made.

The Metallurgy Division will supervise all critical
welding and has provided specifications for an
improved weld joint developed for Incone! tubing.
The components fabricated previously for the
second loop are being changed to conform to the
specifications for the new weld joints. A new
flange for closing the rear of the jacket has been
made in order to give more space for making pipe
connections to the large air lines required for the
heat exchanger,

During installation of the loop in the reactor an
unexpectedly long time was required to connect
heater leads, thermocouple leads, and air, water,
and helium piping in the confined space available
between the shielding and the instrument panel,

The piping at the reactor face is being revised
to facilitate connection when the second loop is
ready for insertion so that installation may be
performed more rapidly. Modifications are also
being made to remove lag in the flow alarms for
the jacket cooling water. The oil systemfor cooling
the pumps is being rebuilt to incorporate more
reliable pumps and improved flow and alarm instrue
ments.

drawal shield has been installed in a wall of a hot

was no evidence of radiation induced corrosion of
the Inconel. The temperature of the pump cell
section was held between 1025 and 1100°F, and
that of the line entering the reactor was somewhat
higher; the temperature of the line emerging from
the reactor was about 1500°F. Before insertion

Development of a suitable apparatus for in-pile

transfer rates from the fuel to a heat sink where
the fission heat can be removed. In the design

heat is removed by gaseous convection at the outer
surface of the sodium-containing chamber and part
by conduction through o metal ring to a water
jacket. Simpler designs in which the sodium was
contained in o constant-diameter annulus did not
permit good temperature control. The temperature
gradient that resulted from simulated fission heot
input at the bottom and heat abstraction at the
top caused heated sodium fo rise discontinuously
in the annulus, and temperature excursions of
100°F in 1 sec were net uncommon. A substantial
temperature gradient (500 to 800°F per in.) is
required to meet headroom requirements in the
experimental hole and to prevent sodium distil-
lation out of the annulus.

Several designs of the sodium annulus were

sodium distillation is not taking place in sufficient
quantities to cause trouble.

In the apparatus a tubular Inconel specimen con-
taining 0.2 g of NaF-ZrF ,-UF, (53.5-40.0-6.5 mole
%) in the fuel chamber attached to the fixed base
is eccentrically loaded through a lever arm by a
weight. A stress pattern is produced across the
horizontal cross section which varies from a
maximum compressive stress. Surrounding the
specimen is a sodium coolant chamber with baffles
which reduce the magnitude of the thermal-con-
vection currents and allow closer control of the
specimen temperature. A furnace helps to maintain
the temperature at 1500°F throughout the test.
Two thermocouple wells project into the sodium

chamber to a position neor the walls of the speci-
men af the neutral axis. A double-walled, con-
centric, sodium fill line, with only the outer tube
welded to the chamber, and a vacuum exhaust tube
complete the apparatus. All surfaces in contact
with the fuel and sodium are made of Inconel.

The assembly is hydrogen fired for 1 hr at
1750°F, filled with fuel, and welded in a dry
box under purified helium. The other parts of
the container are welded into subassemblies, hy-
drogen fired, and then welded together, with helium
backing up the welds. The lever arm and weight
are adjusted and spot welded onto the specimen,
and the chamber covers are welded into place.
Before the rig is filled with sodium, it is filled
with NaK and heated to 1000°F to remove any

with the NoK ond leaves the surfaces clean and

any oxides of sodium that may be formed when the
connection to the test rig is made. Once the con-
nection is made, the apparatus is evacuated and
the sodium is melted and forced into the chamber
by helium pressure through the valve; a combi-
nation of high surface tension and back pressure
made filling the chamber somewhat more difficult
without this procedure. For the bench tests, in
which sticks of sodium were used, the filled
chamber was heated while a vacuum was pulled
on the system, and a rise in pressure was noted

at about 525°F, presumably from dissociation of.

sodium hydride. It remains to be seen whether
such a procedure is necessary to ensure the purity
of the sodium now available. The dry-box work
is completed by cutting the outer fill tube, re-
moving the inner (contaminated) tube, and crimping
and welding both the fill and exhaust tubes.

The entire assembly is welded into a stainless
steel water jacket furnished with Kovar seals and
a capillary tube through which helium flows
throughout the test. A probe beneath the weight
cuts off the current to the furnace at a prede-
termined deflection of the lever arm and indicates
the time required for a given degree of deformation.
A gravity ‘‘tilt"’ indicator aids in plumbing the
specimen in the exposure can. A base plate with
a conical cup furnishes a well for the sodium in
case of rupture during operation. A suitable safety
system is being developed.

Approval by the LLITR Experiment Review Com-
mittee is being withheld until additional tests are
made on the compatibility of sodium with the
various component materials it might contact if
a rupture occurred at the test temperature. Several
tests aimed at a qualitative determination of the
speed of reaction and the heat generated by such
reactions should be completed within a short time.

After an irradiation period of from two to six
weeks in hole HB-3 of the LITR and a suitable
decay period, the specimen is to be sectioned by
the remote metallography group and examined for
stress-carrosion effects.

144

Bench tests on the specimen tube alone are
under way with the outside surface in air. The
inside of the tubes contains either air, helium, or
NaF-ZrF -UF, (50-46-4 mole %). An atmosphere
chamber has been built for testing four specimens
simultaneously in vacuum or any desired atmos-
phere. One 200-hr test has been completed on
barren NaF-ZrF ,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %) af 1500°F
and about 1500 psi. No stress dependence of
corrosion was found; another specimen was tested
for 400 hr but has not yet been examined. A
melting and overturning technique for removing
fluoride fuel from the section that is to be ex-
amined metallographically has been successful;
this will greatly simplify handling of irradiated
capsules.

The MTR tensile creep rig is undergoing final
testing and is scheduled for irradiation tests on
Inconel in October.

Work was continued on the examination of the
solid-type fuel sandwiches of interest to the Pratt
& Whitney Aircraft Division. In addition to the
two experiments mentioned previously, six other
specimens have been examined. The results on
three of them (capsules 1-4, 1-6, 1-7) have been
published.” A report covering the other three
capsules (1-5, 1-8, 1-9) is being prepared. Ex-
amination of the eight capsules processed to date
has indicated greater resistance to cracking and
core-clad separation upon bending of the stainless-
steel-matrix samples than upon bending of the
iron-matrix samples, better resistance to cracking
upon bending of the large UO, particle size core
than upon bending of the smaller particle size
core, and a greater increase in hardness upon
irradiation of the small particle size core than
upon irradiation of the larger particle size core.

FISSION-FRAGMENT ANNEALING STUDIES

M. J. Feldman W. Parsley
Solid State Division

Because of interest in the possibility of the
removal of the radiation damage to fuel plates by
annealing, a preliminary study was undertaken.
The eight samples in Pratt & Whitney capsule
1-9 {four were small particle size, <3-p UO_, and
four were large particle size, 15- to 44. uo,)
were selected for the study. One sample from each
group (large and small particle size) was examined
after the following treatment: (1) as irradiated,
(2) 900°F anneal for 24 hr, (3) 1100°F anneal for
24 hr, and (4) 1400°F anneal for 24 hr. A graph
showing the results of this preliminary study is
shown in Fig. 9.8. The conclusion drawn from
this initial study is that a portion of the neutron
damage to the samples has been annealed out.
Since the full annealing temperature for type 347
is about 1800°F (for complete
removal of the effects of cold work), a complete
anneal for neutron damage at 1400°F was not
expected. For the core, where the major portion
of the damage is by fission fragments, it is felt
that the curve shows a reduction in hardness be-
cause of a partial anneal of the neutron damage

with no reduction in the fragment damage. An
attempt will be made to determine the anneal nec-
essary to remove all the neutron damage from this
type of material and, if possible, the fission-
fragment annealing temperatures.

Fission probes with different fissionable ma-
terials were used to make neutron flux traverses
in HB-3 of the MTR. The fissionable materials
used included U238, Y236 Np237 and Th232,
whose fission threshold energies span the energy
region between ¥ and 2 Mev. The data from these
traverses will be used with the results from acti-
vations in HB-3 of other, nonfissionable, threshold
detectors that are in the process of being irradi-
ated.

After measurements have been completed in HB-3
with the hole empty, several inches of beryllium
will be introduced into the hole in such a way as
to change the energy distribution of the trans-
mitted neutrons. The new energy distribution will
then be measured, and materials will be irradiated
in both moderated and unmoderated neutron spectra.
An attempt will then be made to correlate spectra
and radiation damage. '?

10. ANALYTICAL STUDIES OF REACTOR MATERIALS

C. D, Susano

Metallurgy Division

The primary analytical problem continues to be
the separation and determination of trivalent and
tetravalent uranium in both NaZrF .. and NaF-KF-
LiF-base fuels. A successful potentiometric titra-
tion of UF, in molten NaZrF, with metallic zir-
conium was accomplished by means of polarized
platinum electrodes, The observed end point
occurred ot a weight of titrant which corresponded
to one-half an equivalent of zirconium metal per
mole of UF,, This stoichiometry indicates reduc-
tion of UF, to a mixed oxidation state. Polaro-
grophic studies of uranium fluorides in reactor fuels
dissolved in molten ammonium formate at 125°C
were initiated. Preliminary experiments revealed
that tetravalent uranium was not reduced at the
dropping-mercury electrode. Molten ammonium
formate appears to be a useful solvent for fluoride
base fuels containing various oxidation states of
uranium. The conversion of UF, to UCI in fluoride
fuels was shown to be quantitative when the fuel
was heated with boron trichloride at 400°C for
90 min. Trivalent uranium fluoride is converted to
UCI; under these conditions. The solubility of
UF, in NaAICI, was found to be 18 mg/g at 200°C
as contrasted to a solubility of UF, of less than
1 mg/g. Molten NaAICl, is expected to dissolve
tetravalent uranium selectively from the fuels,

Calibration measurements have been completed
on the opparatus for the determination of oxygen as
metallic oxides in reactor fuels. The reaction in-
volves the hydrofluorination of the oxide and
measurement of the increase in conductivity of
liquid HF as a function of the water formed.

Investigations were also made on the oxidation
of UF, with oxygen at elevated temperatures. At
300°C, UF, is converted quantitatively to UF,
and UQ,. The mechanism of the oxidation of UF,
with oxygen is being studied. An oxide residue of
about 11% of the original material was found when
UF, was heated in oxygen at 300°C for 2 hr,

An improved method for the determination of
lithium in NaF-KF-LiF-base fuels was developed.
The chloride salt is extracted with 2-ethylhexanol,
and the chloride is titrated in the nonagueous
mediums,

148

Studies were also made on the solubilities of
potassium, rubidium, and cesium tetraphenylborates
in various organic solvents to ascertain differential
solubilities, The feasibility of o spectrophoto-
metric titration of fluoride in NaF-KF(RbF)-LiF-
base materials by decolorization of zirconium or
aluminum complexes was investigated, Determina-
tion of the concentration of oil in helium was made
by absorbing the hydrocarbons in petroleum ether
and weighing the residue obtained after evaporation,
It was found that prior bleeding of the line effec-
tively eliminated contamination by oil,

the molten state, for which polarized platinum
electrodes were used, ond polarographic studies of
fluoride mixtures in molten ammonium formate.
Work was continued on the determination of oxygen

The reaction vessel, a modified Parr bomb, is
silver plated on the inner surfaces, as are the
lines and the fittings in the reactor-conductivity
cell section.

In the procedure now being tested the sample is
placed in the reaction vessel and the system is
evacuated to valve 5 (see Fig. 10.1). After the
cell has been filled with a measured volume of
the distillate, the conductivity is measured and
the acid is transferred to the reaction vessel by
distillation. When the oxides have been converted
to water, the solution of water in hydrofluoric

acid is distilled to the cell where the measurement
of conductivity is made. Transfers of the ocid
are repeated until constant readings are obtained.
The distillation apparatus has been tested and
has been found to deliver anhydrous acid ot a rate
sufficient to fill the cell in less than 1 min, When
the still was charged with 99% HF, the conduc-
tivity of the distillate corresponded to a maximum
concentration of water of approximately 1 ppm.

Oxidation-Reduction Titrations in Fused Salts

A, S. Meyer, Jr.
Analytical Chemistry Division

Experiments were carried out to determine whether
the equivalence point of a titration in which UF,
dissolved in a molten fluoride fuel solvent is re-
duced by the addition of small increments of an
electrodeposition metal could be observed by one
of the conventional electrometric techniques. The
first system studied involved the reduction of UF,
in NaZrF. by zirconium metal according to the
proposed reaction

AUF, + Zr° > AUF, + ZrF, |

Since no insulating material which is compatible
with molten NaZrF was available, it was not
possible to devise a reference electrode for meas-
urement of the potentials of the solutions. Accord-
ingly, polarized platinum electrodes were selected
as indicating electrodes. In order to obtain more
information about the nature of the polarization
phenomena, the area of one of the electrodes was
made approximately 80 times that of the other.
Thus,
electrode was 80 times as great as that ot the
larger, the potentiol difference between the elec-
trodes was approximately equal to that of the

the polarizing current, it was possible to determine
the potential at the cathode and at the anode.

The solution of UF, in NaZrF 5 was contained in
a 25m! platinum crucible which was placed in the
helium-filled quartz liner of a pot furnace. Agi-
tation was accomplished by means of a mechani-
cally driven platinum stirrer which was constructed
of 0.05in.-dia platinum wire. Additions to the
solution were made through o quartz tube which
extended from the top of the liner to a point about
1 in. above the melt.

In pure NaZrF. the onode was more strongly
polarized than the cathode. At polarizing currents
of 80 pa the potential of both electrodes exceeded
1 v. Approximately Y hr was required for the
electrodes to reach equilibrium. Platinum elec-
trodes could not be appreciably polarized in NaF-
KF-LiF-base fuels,

When UF, was added to the molten NaZrF, the

potential decreased rapidly. For a solution which

Formate, LRL.-117 (April 1959)

contained 1.25 mole % UF, the potential of both
electrodes was approximately 300 mv, with no
significant difference between the potentials of the
cathode and anode,

During the early part of the titration of the molten
fluoride mixture with zirconium metal, the potential
of the cathode decreased to values less thon 10 mv
and remained constant throughout the titration. At
the same time the potential of the anode increased
rapidly ond attained potentials in excess of 1 v
before the end point of the titration was reached,
When an equivalence point was reached, the poten-
tial of the anode decreased rapidly to about 50 mv
and then decreased gradually on further addition of
reductant, Only one breck in the potential vs
titrant curve was observed. The curve is shown

EQUIVALENTS OF ZIRCONIUM PER MOLE OF UF,
Fig. 10.2. Titration of UF, in Molten NaZrF,

with Zirconium Metal,

The observed end points of two titrations occurred
at a weight of titrant which corresponded to one-
half an equivalent of zirconium metal per mole of
UF,. This stoichiometry indicates the reduction of
UF, to a mixed oxidation state that corresponds
to the postulated formula U,F.

Polarographic Studies in Fused Ammonium Formate

A. S. Meyer, Jr. D. L. Manning
Analytical Chemistry Division

Colichman? reported that when solutions of uct,
in molten ammonium formate were reduced at the
dropping-mercury electrode, three well-defined re-
duction waves with half-wave potentials of —0.1 to

-0.2, 0.75 to ~0.80, and 0.95 v (vs pool) were
obtained. The following reactions were postulated
to explain these waves:

 

urls ute u*2
and
ut 20s gn lly gr 22 go

He also reported that anhydrous hexavalent uranium
gave no reduction wave until after an aging period
during which the compounds were reduced by the
ammonium formate to a lower valence state, probably
quadrivalent,

Since it appeared that this techni que could be
applied to the determination of tetravalent uranium
in the presence of large quantities of trivalent
uranium, experiments were carried out fo obtdin
polarograms of solutions of UF,. In preliminary
experiments it was found that UF, and NaZrF c-
ond NaF-KF-LiF-base fuels dissolved readily in
molten ammonium formate ot 125°C to form green
solutions containing as much as 1 mg of uronium
per milliliter. Although UF, alone was found to be
much less soluble, UF which had been fused with
NaZrF . was readily soluble. Similar relationships
were found when molten ammonium acetate was
used as a solvent, :

No U(lV) reduction waves were obtained when
polarograms of solutions of UF, were recorded
immediately after dissolution, and no reduction
waves were observed in the polarograms of a
sample of NaF-KF-LiF-base fuel that contained
both UF, and UF,. When these solutions were
aerated, a single reduction ‘wave with a half
wave potential of approximately —0.2 v was ob-
served, The potential and the diffusion current of
this wave corresponded closely to those recorded
immediately after the dissolution of an equivalent
quantity of K;UO,F; in molten formate. Since the
UV) waves may have been shifted to potentials
outside the range of the solvent (0 to ~0.9 v) by
the complexing action of the fluoride ions, addi-
tional polarograms were token of solutions con-
taining UCl,, Except for a smail reduction wave
ot about ~0.2'v, ne evidence of reduction was found.
The diffusion current of this wave was increased
by aeration to values corresponding to those ob-
tained for hexavalent uronium, and therefore the
increase was attributed to the oxidation of uct.
It appears that in molten ammonium formate no
oxidation state of uranium other thon hexavalent is
reduced at the dropping-mercury electrode.

analytical application, tests were carried out with
gaseous BCI, at elevated temperatures. This tech-
nique offered an additional advontage in that the
resulting chlorides could be separated by sublimo-
tion.

When a sample of NaZrF UF, fuel was heated
in a stream of BCI; and helium at 350°C, the bulk
of the zirconium was sublimed as ZrCl, within 90
min, and all but fraces were removed after heating
for an additional hour at 450°C. [+ has been re-
ported? that uranium can be sublimed as UCI
treating UF, with BCL, at 600 to 650°C, but in
these tests only a small fraction of the UCI, was
volatilized when the UCI,-NaCl residue, which
fused at about 450°C, was heated to temperatures
as high as 750°C,

Analyses of the residues showed that when the
conversion was carried out at 400°C for 90 min the
uranium in the NoZrF -UF "samples was quanti-
tatively converted to UCI, ond that all the uranium
remained in the residue, When the conversion was
carried out at 500°C, 2% of the uranium ‘was
volatilized, while at 750°C, 4% was volatilized,

When UF, samples were converted to UCI, by
this method, significant fractions of the uranium
were oxidized to UCI, It is believed that this
oxidation will be eliminated when all traces of
oxidizing contaminants are removed from the gase-
ous reactants,

and UF, to the corresponding chlorides,” it was
noted that UF, wos dissolved much more readily
thon UF; by fused NaAICl,, Measurements of the
solubilities were carried out by equilibrating sam-
ples of the uranium fluorides with molten NaAIC],
for periods up to 5 hr, under an inert atmosphere,
followed by the separation of the undissolved
solids by filtration and calculation of the solubility
from the concentration of uranium in the filtrate,

Solubilities of 18 and 16 mg of UF, per gram of
NaAICl were found at 200 and 175°C, respectively.
However, the solubility of UF, decreased from
5 mg/g of NaAICl, at 225°C to less than 1 mg/g at
200°C. Since UCI; was also found to be sparingly
soluble at the lower temperatures, the above values
are indicative of the true solubility of trivalent ura-
nium in this medium rather than of incomplete con-
version of the fluoride to chloride. At temperatures
lower than 200°C, molten NaAlCl, is expected to
dissolve tetravalent uranium selectively from UF,
which has been complexed by potassium fluoride in
the fuel,

Since all available UF; samples are contaminated
with tetravalent uranium, it has not been possible
to carry out accurate solubility meosurements at
the lower temperatures by relying on the determina-
tion of total dissolved uranium. An apparatus has
been constructed for the determination of microgram
quantities of trivalent uranium in the filirates by
hydrogen evolution. This apparatus, which is based
on the measurement of evolved gases at reduced
pressures, is now being calibrated against cou-
lometrically generated hydrogen. In order to carry
out dissolutions at lower temperatures, LiCI-AlIC|
fluxes which melt at approximately 120°C have
been prepared.

In these tests the reaction time was held constant

At 300°C the reaction proceeds quontitatively as
written. At higher temperatures, however, the con-
centration of soluble uranium (UF, in ammonium
oxalate) decreased rapidly from the theoretical
content with increasing temperature, probably as a
consequence of a further reaction of oxygen with
UF ,.

The experiment was then repeated with UF, and
oxygen, At 200°C the entire sample was soluble
in ammonium oxalate, as expected, which indicated
no oxide formation. At higher temperatures, a black

The yellow color of the filtrate substantiates this

for the black residue, obviously an oxide of ura-

quantitatively to U;Og when ignited at 900°C in
air. Petrographic and x-ray studies of the material
will be made. Further tests are planned at various

applicable to the andlysis of NaF-KF(RbF)-LiF-
base reactor fuels.

Lithium. An indirect volumetric method for the
determination of lithium in the presence of the
large concentrations of sodium and potassium and/or
rubidium which are found in NaF-KF(RbF)-LiF-base
fuels was developed. The method was designed
specifically to provide a rapid, and yet precise,
means of determining lithium. The alkali metals
are first separated from uranium and then converted
to chlorides. Lithium is extracted as the soluble
chloride salt by heating of about 135°C with
2-ethythexanol® until the slightly soluble salts
of sodium and potassium become ‘free-flowing’
and no longer cling to the walls of the vessel,
These salts are removed by filtration, and then the
filtrate is diluted with ethanol. The chloride in the
filtrate is titrated by the Volhard method,? and the
lithium concentration is calculated, The coefficient
of variation is 0.5% for 1 to 50 mg of lithium. A
topical report of this work is being written,

Potassium and Rubidium. Since the concentration
of either potassium or rubidium in NaF-KF(RbF)-
LiF-base fuels is of the order of 30 wt %, the de-
termination of potassium or rubidium by means of
the flame photometer has been neither sufficiently
accurate nor precise, The conventional method for
this determination is the perchlorate separation !?
of potassiumor rubidium perchlorate from the sodium
and lithium salts in ethyl acetate. The method is
entirely considerable
operator time. Therefore the application of possible
substitute procedures which are specific for potas-
sium and/or rubidium was investigated,
cedure!! involving the precipitation of potassium
bitartrate in ethanol-water and titration of the
solution of the salt with standard base was tested.
The method is extremely simple and rapid, and the

solubility of potassium bitartrate before a decision
can bereached as to the applicability of this method
to NaF-KF-LiF-base fuels.

A second method under consideration is the use of
sodium tetraphenyl boron? as a reagent for the
direct determination of potassium, rubidium, and
cesium. The potassium salt is precipitated in
aqueous acidic solution, filtered, dried at 110°C,
and weighed as potassium tetraphenylborate, The
method hos the advantage of being simple and rapid,
and it has a favorable weight factor for potassium.
The main interference in the use of tetrapheny!boron
is the ammonium ion. The reagent is expensive,
but it is readily avoiloble at the present time,
Preliminary work on the solubilities of potassium,
rubidium, and cesium tetraphenylborates in non-
aqueous solvents has shown some interesting dife
ferences in solubilities. The possibility of ex-
ploiting differential solubility aus a means of
separafing the salts is being explored. Acetyl-
acetone, diethylketone, and methyl isopropylketone
are three possible solvents for this separation.
The order of solubility in organic solvents has been
established as: KTPB > RbTPB > CsTPB (TPB =
tetraphenylboron).

Fluoride lon, The determination of fluoride ion
in fluoride fuels was previously conducted by the
pyrohydrolysis 1? procedure which was particularly
successful for NaZrF  -base fuels. Alkali metal
fluorides, however, are resistant to pyrohydrolysis,
and thus considerable time, of the order of 3 to 4 hr,
is required to pyrohydrolyze completely 100 mg of
NaF-KF-LiF-base material.

Two alternative methods have been studied,
therefore, for application to the determination of
fluoride ion in NaF-KF-LiF-base materials, A pro-
cedure, which was formulated by Chilton, 14 was
tested. In this procedure the fluoride ion is titrated
with a standard solution of aluminum (potassium
alum), and the resulting change in acidity is re-
corded. Considerable difficulties have been en-
countered, the foremost of which is the extremely
small change in pH at the equivalence point. The
method in its present form does not appear to be
applicable to this work,

zirconium or aluminum complex, or lake, is also
being investigated, In this method, the solution of
fluoride is titrated with o colored zirconium com-
plex, and the change in absorbance of the solution
is plotted as a function of the concentration of
in the complex. Zirconium alizarin
sulfonate and zirconium eriochrome cyaonine both
react rapidly with fluoride ion and will receive
further study. Preliminary results indicate that the

zirconium

reactions of these compounds with the fluoride ion
are reproducible. A simple titration cell is being

designed.
Qil Contamination in ARE Helium

G. Goldberg
Analytical Chemistry Division

The contamination of the helium for the ARE with
oil from valves and fittings was checked before the
gas at the site was used. The method used for
these tests was to pass the gas through dual
scrubbing towers containing petroleum ether and
then to evaporate the ether to dryness and weigh
the residue. In the initial test on a tank car of
helium, 360 pg/H#3 was found. A tower containing
70 in.3 of charcoal was placed in the gas line, but
it had little effect in eliminating the oil, Further
tests on the same tank car showed that bleeding the
line before samples were taken markedly lowered
the contamination level, For example, in three
successive samples of 15.5 fi3 of gas each, the
contamination decreased from 100 to 10 pg/ft3,
These tests indicate thot bleeding the line with
50 to 100 ft3 of gas before the equipment is coupled
into the system will effectively remove oil from

FLUORIDE FUEL

G. D. White, Metallurgy Division
T. N. McVay, Consultant

Petrographic studies of UF; in alkali-metal fluo-
ride systems have shown that two phases exist in
the KF-UF, system, One is red and is near
3KF.UF ;, and the other is blue and is near KF.UF,.
Only one binary phase is present in the NaF-UF,
system, and it is probably 3NaF.2UF,, Lithium
fluoride has not been found to combine with UF,
in either the binary system LiF-UF,, in the ternary

154

systems LiF-KF-UF, or LiF-NaF-UF,, or in the
quarternary system LiF-NoF-KF-UF,, Cesium
fluoride was found to form a complex with UF,
with a composition near 3CsF-UF,, Some work was
done on the systems LiF-ZnF, and NaF-CsF, and
no binary compounds were found,

Part of a loop in which NaF-ZrF .UF, (50-46-4
mole %) had been circulated was received from
Battelle Memorial Institute, Samples taken from the
wall contained about 50% ZrO,, and the balance
was on NaF-ZrF, (53-47 mole %) compound. In
addition, several loops containing NaF and ZrF,
with reduced UF, have been examined, and no
appreciable oxidation of the UF; could be found.

SUMMARY OF SERVICE ANALYSES

Analytical Chemistry Division

Most of the somples received during the past
quarter were from NaZrF,- and NaF-KF-LiF-base
materials, Other types of samples that were
analyzed included silver fluoride, chromium fluo-
rides, iron fluorides, beryllium, sodium, and
rubidium metals, Inconel, and alkali-metal car-
bonates, A revised procedure was established to
determine UF; and UF; in NaF-KF-LiF-base fuels.
Also, the method of White, Ross, and Rowan'3 was
adapted successfully to the determination of oxygen
and metallic impurities in rubidium metal.

A total of 1,165 samples, involving 10,702 de-
terminations, was analyzed, A bredkdown of the
work is given in Table 10.1.

Theoretical analyses have been made so that an
understanding of the air and ground scattering
measurements at the Tower Shielding Facility could
be obtained and the attenuation in the side wall of
an aircraft crew shield could be determined. In
connection with the air and ground scattering analy-
ses, special attention was given to the calculation
of the reduction of air scattering due fo ground
interruption and to the effects of multiple scattering.
The gamma-ray slant penetration has been calcu-
lated for the side wall of an aircraft crew shield,
and the variation of radiation intensity throughout
the crew volume has been briefly explored.

SLANT PENETRATION OF COMPOSITE
SLAB SHIELDS BY GAMMA RAYS

C.D. Zerby

The total radiation dose in the crew compartment
of an airplane is partially dependent on the gamme-
ray flux penetrating the compartment shield. To
obtain a fundamental, but practical, knowledge of
the gamma-ray penetrations, the problem has been
treated theoretically by using stochastic, or Monte
Carlo methods.

The problem was programed for solution on the
ORACLE and was arranged for investigating the
effects of the variations of all the parameters in-
volved. The shield was taken as a composite slab
of two materials comprising a thick layer of Compton
scattering material! followed by a thin layer of
lead. In each of many cases the initial incident
photons were taken as monoenergetic and incident
on the slab at a particular angle with the normal to
the slab. The stochastic process used the exact
physical analog of the probability laws known to
govern the life of a photon.

 

Hn the range of energy considered, the Compton
scatterer has appreximately the same physical chorac-
teristics relative to a photon passing through it as does
concrete or polyethylene (CH,

AIR SCATTERING OF NEUTRONS

in an effort to understand the air-scattered neutron
intensities which have been measured at the Tower
Shielding Facility, a number of calculations have
been carried out with a variety of conditions and
assumptions. The predominant difference between
the current work and that which was done pre-
viously4 is that the interference of the ground has

better fit to the data, such aspects as anisotropy of
scattering and slant penetration af the detector tank
(crew shield) have been taken into account in some
of the work. Furthermore, measurements have been
made of the angular distribution of the radiation
leaving the reactor shield, and these data have
been used in some of the calculations.

Because the importance of the multiply scattered
neutrons has appeared to be greater than was antici-
pated, considerable effort has been made to extend
the calculations to beyond the singly scattered
case. Some results ore reported for two scatterings,
and a general method has been developed for all
orders of scattering.

Single Anisotropic Air Scattering in the Presence

of the Ground (Shielded Detector)
F. H. Murray

For a convenient machine calculation, the at-
tenuation in air was neglected, The detector was
placed with 10 cm of water between it and the face
of the crew shield which, when extended, contained
the reactor source. The beam from the source was
about an axis through the detector, in theory, and
contained terms cos a and cos? a; a calculation
was made separately for the terms 1, cos a, and
cos? ain the expansion of the source flux. If D is
the reactor-detector distance und 5 the height of
both above the ground, the flux at the detector is
expressed as the sum of the terms:

Single Isotropic Air Scattering in the Presence

of the Ground (Unshielded Detector)
J. E. Faulkner

A calculation was made of the reading of an iso-
tropic detector caused by first-scattered neutrons
in air as the distance above the ground was varied.
The following assumptions were made:

1. The source and detector have the same alti-
tude,

2. The ground is an infinite plane.

3. The source is isotropic.

4. The scattering in air is isotropic.

5. There is no energy degradation on air scatter-
ing.

6. The attenuation is pure inverse square.

With these assumptions the reading on the detector
may be shown to be proportional to

GROUND SCATTERING OF NEUTRONS
A. Simon H. E. Stern

An investigation is being carried out to derive
formulas for the ground-scatitered neutron flux to
be obtained from a general source distribution. The
model used is that of a source whose axis, or
direction of maximum intensity, forms an arbitrary
angle 0 with the source-receiver axis but lies in
the same horizontal plane as the latter. The
differential source strength is assumed to be a
function of only the angle between the emergent
ray and the source axis. The receiver is isotropic

FOCUSING OF RADIATION IN A
CYLINDRICAL CREW COMPARTMENT

J. E. Faulkner

A study of the focusing of radiation in a cylindri-
cal crew compartment has been made, with particular
attention being given to the case with the following
conditions:

1. The cylinder is infinite.

2. The
along the inner cylinder walls.

3. The distribution of the radiation
depends only on the angle between the direction of
emergence and the normal to the cylinder,

4. The attenuation inside the crew space is pure
inverse square,

5. The detector is isotropic.

Under these conditions the angular distribution
may be represented as an isotropic component plus
a series in odd powers of the cosine. The contri-

surface radiation density is constant

angular

bution of each term at a given point in the com-
ponent in the series may be expressed in an even
polynomial in x (see Fig. 11.3), where x is the
distance of the given point from the axis-of the
cylinder divided by the radius of the cylinder.
For pure cosine distribution the reading of an
isotropic detector is independent of position in the
crew compartment.

gamma measurements were taken in pure water in

than that normally observed in the LTSF, and the
increase agrees closely with the calculated 9-Mev

in addition to the presently planned static fission

The solution (density = 1.312 + 0.001

of the high-energy capture gamma ray from the

These measurements
are of interest for evaluating a graphite reflector as
a shield component, and they also provide a direct
comparison with LTSF determinations of the carbon
removal cross section. Graphite thicknesses of
1, 2, ond 3 ft were used, and the usual gamma-ray,
thermal<neutron, and fast-nesutron dose measure-
ments were made behind each slab thickness. In
addition, the fast-neuiron spectrum (above 1.3
Mev) through 1 ft of graphite was measured,

A graphite slab 1 ft thick and one 2 ft thick were
constructed, and the 3-ft thickness was obtained by
strapping these two slabs together, When strapped
together, there was no possibility of water getting
between the slabs. Fach slab was constructed
largely of graphite blocks, 4 in. x 12 in, x 5 ft,
stacked in aluminum tanks in such a way that
there could be no streaming of radiation through
cracks extending through an entire slab thickness.

 

Vihe details of this experiment will be reported in a
memorandum by R. G. Cochran et al., Reactor Radi-

ations Through Slabs of Graphite, ORNL CF-54-7-105

Thin graphite shims were added to fill the tanks,
which were sealed by heliarc welding and were
pressure tested for leaks, The total aluminum wall
thickness for each tank was 1.3 cm.

Bulk Shielding Reactor loading No. 26 (Fig. 13.1)
was used. This configuration is very similar fo
loading 22, which has been studied in considerable
detail for other experiments,? but loading 26 uses
less fuel to compensate for the presence of the
graphite, which is a better reflector than the water
it replaces. Since the presence of the graphite
perturbed the neutron flux in the reactor core
rather severely, the neutron flux distributions and
thus the reactor power were determined in the
usual way by means of cobalt foils.

REACTOR AIR GLOW

R. G. Cochran T. A. Love
K. M. Henry F. C. Maienschein
R. W, Peelle

Attempts to theoretically determine the amount of
visible light which may surround a nuclear-powered
airplane in flight have resulted in widely differing

170

values,3*® Therefore an experiment was performed
at the BSF to provide an experimental basis for
future estimates,

The end of an air-filled aluminum periscope tube
was placed at the reactor face, and the amount of
light produced in the tube was measured by a
photomultiplier with spectral response similar
Other relative
measurements were taken with a photomultiplier

which was sensitive chiefly in the blue and near-

to that of the average human eye.

ultraviolet range. The latter measurements are
plotted in Fig. 13.6 as functions of the air pressure
in the tube. Measurements with argon in the tube
demonstrate that neither the approximate amount of
light produced nor the exact spectrum emitted is
strongly dependent on the atomic number of the
gas. It is also interesting to note that the light
production in a given volume of air appears to have
a maximum af a pressure corresponding to an
altitude of about 30,000 fi.

It is demonstrated in Figs. 13.7 and 13.8 that
the air glow is largely caused by gomma radiation
rather than by neutrons. Figure 13.7 shows the
decay of the light plotted along with the decay of
the reactor gamma ion chamber current just after
reactor shutdown. The attenuation by water of
the radiation which produces the air glow is shown
in Fig. 13.8.

follows that of gamma rays.

This attenuation rather closely

The photomultiplier was used to compare the
quantity of light given off in the air-glow tube with
that from a small tungsten lamp mounted at the
reactor end of the tube, This comparison showed
that 7.2 x 107° lumen was given off by the glow
for a reactor power of 100 kw and atmospheric
pressure. Presumably, the amount of light should
be proportional to the integral of the gamma-ray
dose rate over the volume of the air inthe measuring
tube. This integral was estimated to be 1.1 x 10'0
(r-em3)/hr. Therefore the effective light production
per unit volume of air is

L = 6.5% 107 (lumen/cm®)/(r/hr) .
If it is assumed thot all the light is given off at

reactor shield of 147 em of water (similar to the

the BSF measurements indicate that the gamma-ray

The dose integrated over space outside the shield
is 1.2 x 10'5 (r-em®)/hr. Multiplying this by L,
the luminosity would be 75 lumens, which would
have roughly the equivalent brightness to the eye
of a 10-w (£7 w) incandescent light if the aircraft

FUEL ACTIVATION METHOD FOR POWER
DETERMINATION OF THE ARE

E., B. Johnson

When the ARE goes into operation, many measure-
ments of its performance will be made. Among
them will be the power level at which it operates,
which will be measured in more than one way. A
method suggested by J. L. Meem is based on the
measurement of the relative activity of fuel samples
exposed in the ARE and in a known flux in another
reactor (BSR). An experiment has been initiated

at the BSF to implement this suggestion.

Causing Air Glow.

The activity resulting from the irradiation of
fissionable material is not easy to predict because
of the large number of isotopes for which calcu-
lations would be required. However, for identical
flux, exposure time, and waiting period after
exposure, the specific activity of two samples
should be the same. Furthermore, at low neutron
fluxes the activity should be proportional to the
flux.

It is contemplated that the ARE will be operated
at a nominal power level of approximately 1 w for
1 hr, that it will then be shut down, and that a
sample of the irradiated fuel will be withdrawn for
counting and analyzing. The ARE experimental
program will then proceed as scheduled. A decay
curve will be run on this fuel sample from the ARE
and compared with the decay curve obtained on a
similor fuel capsule irradiated for the same length
of time in the BSR in a known neutron flux of about
the same magnitude. From the relative activity of
the two samples, the operating power of the ARE

The Tower Shielding Facility (TSF) experimental
program has, thus far, included measurements of
ground- and air-scattered fast neutrons and the
development of a new procedure for the determi-
nation of the power of the reactor. Tests on the
GE-ANP R-1 divided-shield mockup have been

started.

FAST-NEUTRON GROUND AND AIR
SCATTERING MEASUREMENTS

T.V. Blosser J. Van Hoomissen
D. L. Gilliland F. N. Watson

The performance of neutron and gamma-ray air
scattering experiments that are free from an ex-
cessive background of ground-scaftered radiation
is a primary objective of the TSF, Therefore,
measurements of the scattered fast neutrons as
a function of reactor-detector altitude were neces-
sary to determine the contribution of ground-
scattered radiation to the total flux, particularly
at the maximum altitude. These measurements will
help to indicate the magnitude of the ground-
scattered neutron background to be expected in
future differential experiments, ond they will aid
in an understanding of the variation of ground and
air scattering as the ground is approached.

Measurements of the thermal-neutron distribution
were token in the detector tank, which is es-
sentially a 5-ft cube of water and which was, for
these experiments, situated 64 ft from the reactor
tank. The reactor was placed at an angle 0 of
330 dey from the 4 axis (Fig. 14.1), and a BF,
counter was moved along a line normal to and near
the right side of the detector tank. In this region,
contributions from other faces of the tank were
negligible; thus the neutrons detected by the
counter were the air- or ground-scattered fast
neutrons which entered the side wall and were
thermalized in the water near the detector. The
reactor and detector tank altitudes were varied
simultaneously, in discrete steps, from 0 to 195 ft.

A composite plot of the measurements (Fig. 14.2)
indicated only small differences in slope but ap-
precicble differences in magnitude between the
curves for the various altitudes. A plot of the
flux vs the altitude (Fig. 14.3) showed a .pro-
nounced peak in the region between the 15- and
20-ft altitudes, which indicated the importance of
ground-scattered neutrons in this region. It should
be noted that the reading of zero altitude was
obtained with the in the
ground pool, the upper holf being shielded as
so essentially half of the source was
occluded, as was half of the scattering medium.
Thus the air-scattered neutrons should be no more
than half of the value at full altitude and no less
than one quarter. Because the intensities at the
150- and 195-ft altitudes were the same, it was
concluded that the ground-scattered contribution
at these altitudes was small,

reactor half-immersed

before;

In a preliminary analysis of the data, it was
estimated that this contribution was 2 to 5% of
the total scattered neutrons. While the detailed
calculations of ground ond air scattering being
undertaken in connection with this investigation
are not yet completed, o preliminary comparison
of the data with calculations carried out at ‘the
Boeing Airplane Company for a not too dissimilar
situation has been made. The qualitative agree-
ment is very good, although the peak in the fotal
flux, as measured, seems to be of a lower altitude.
A report on this experiment is being prepared.’

Thermocouple measurements of the bulk
temperature in the 12-ft-dia reactor tank

ficiently to ensure that no significant difference
in temperature exists throughout the tank. The
rate of temperature rise of the water when the
reactor is started is then proportional to the power
of the reactor. Small corrections must be made
for the power input due to the mixing and for the
heat loss.

This procedure was first used for a 5 by 6 fuel
element loading in the TSR. The reactor tank
was lowered into the drained handling pool, and
four mixers were placed at various positions within
the tank, The turbulence created by the mixers
was sufficient for thorough mixing of the water,
but the power added by the mixers was not enough
to give a measurable increase of the water temper-

ature. Before the reactor was started, the temper-

178

ature remained constant for more than 1 hr with
the mixers running.

Some heat insulation was obtained by creating,
with a double layer of canvas, a dead-air space
above the water and around the reactor tank. The
temperature rise during a reactor run was measured
by 12 thermocouples placed in the tank. The
thermocouples had previously been calibrated at
temperatures of 0, 25, and 50°C and agreed to
within 0.1°C.

The first run of the experiment was started at
24°C, and the total temperature rise was approxi-
mately 14°C. The experiment was repeated at a
higher temperature level but with the some heat
input and total temperature rise. The initial
temperature for this run was approximately 15°C
above the ambient temperature, and the rise was
again 14°C. The cooling rate at the conclusion
of this run was 0.3°C/hr. In a third run the initial
temperature was brought 15°C below the ambient
by cooling the reactor tank with ice before the run.
The results of the three runs were consistent to
within 1%. A detailed report of this experiment
is being prepared.?

D. L. Gilliland F. N. Watson

Tests on the GE-ANP R-1 divided-shield mockup
(Figs. 14.4 and 14.5) will begin with traverses
around the reactor-shield section in the handling
pool for comparison with measurements made at
the BSF. Measuraments will then be made in
the TSI detector tank, which will be situated 64 ft
from the reactor shield ot an altitude of 195 fi.
It is anticipated that the detector tank will be
replaced by the crew-compartment mockup in mid-
September.
