EXPERIMENTAL 5 Mw THERMAL CONVECTION MOLTEN SALT REACTOR

J. Zasler

Abstract

A preliminary study has been made of an experimental 5 Mw
thermal convection molten salt reactor. This reactor can
be converted, after a period of low power operation, to a
50 Mw pilot power plant by adding a fuel pump, a larger
sodium pump, and a turbo generator with associated equip-
ment.

Introduction

Based on the history of other reactor types, the development and demon-
stration of the molten salt power reactor concept will require the operation
of a small experimental reactor and a medium sized pilot plant. The simplest
and most reliable experimental reactor system appears to be a thermal convec-
tion reactor. The chief disadvantages of the natural convection system - in-
creased fuel volume and larger heat exchangers are not major factors in a five
Mw reactor.

By adding a fuel pump to the 5 Mw reactor, it is possible to increase the
capacity of the fuel system from 5 to 50 Mw. This, of course, must be acconm-
panied by a corresponding increase in the capacity of the heat dump. It is
thus possible to build one reactor that will serve successively as a small ex-
perimental reactor and a pilot plant.

Description of Reactor

 

Fig. 1 shows an elevation of the reactor plant; Fig. 2 is a plan. viev. The
dimensions and operating conditions for 5 and 50 Mw operation are given in Table
I. The reactor is five feet in diameter with a 6 inch thick blanket surrounding
the core {see Appendix A). Prcvisions are made to connect the blanket and fuel
regions so that the reactor can be operated as a one region reactor.

The 5 Mw reactor is inherently simple end reliable and requires no develop~-
ment of components. No fuel or blanket pumps are required. The sodium pump is
a standard PK pump. : ’

In order to provide for future 50 Mw operation of the system, it is necessary
that the fuel expansion tank be so designed that'a sump type fuel pump can be
installed in it and the sodium lines leading to the heat exchanger be sized to

“handle the flow required for 50 Mw operation.
The 5 Mw reactor would serve the following purposes:

Demonstrate the continuing operation of a molten salt reactor.

1.

2. Provide in-pile corrosion data. (This could be done by inserting removable
samples in both the hot and cold legs.)

%. Develop and demonstrate remote maintenance procedures.

L. By replacing the air heat dump with a steam heat dump it could be used to

demonstrate sodium to steam heat transfer.

Conversicn to 50 Mw operation

 

When the above has been accomplished, the system can be converted to 50
Mw operation and operated as a pilot power plant. Although this plant would
not be identical to the reference design plant, there would be enough points
of similarity, especially in control, corrosion, and maintenance problems so
that successful operation would lead directly to the design and construction
of a large power plant.
Conversion to 50 Mw Operation (continued)

The only modification required to the fuel circuit is the installation
of a sump type fuel pump in the fuel expansion tank. The fuel to sodium heat
exchanger designed for the 5 Mw operation would be satisfactory for 50 Mw
operation, because of the reduction in the fuel film resistance in going from
laminar flow at the lower power to turbulent flow at the higher power.

A complete analysis of the blanket circuit has not been made, however,
rough caléulations show the possibility of designing a thermal convection
blanket circuit that could be used at both power levels. If this turns out
to be impractical, a blanket pump can be installed for. 50 Mw operation.

The sodium system is cut at the points shown in Figs. 1 and 2 and a new
system consisting of a 10,000 gpm pump and sodium to steam heat exchanger is
installed.

A turbo-generator and associated equipment is also installed to complete
the pilot plant.

Cost Estimate

Table 11 shows a rough cost estimate, of approximately $10, 000, 1000 for
the constrtiction of the 5 Mw plant. ‘For approximately $10, 000,000 additional,
this plant could be converted to the 50 Mw size, as shown in Table 111.

Ne attempt was made in | this limited study to optimize either the 5 or 50
Mw plants.

Further study would undoubtedly be profitable. The 5 and 50 Mw power
levels were chosen, arbitrarily and it is quite possible that a differént choice
is preferable. A number of problems remain which were not investigated but
which appear to be capable of solution. Among tliese are: 1) the design of the
blanket circuit, 2) the method of removing fission gas, 3) the design of the
5 Mw heat dump, and 4) the design of the steam system. :

Appendix A
Selection of Uranium Concentration and Core Size

The design variables in the Reference Design Reactor, described in refer-
ence 1, which it is desirable to match in a test reactor are, in order of their
importance:

power density in fuel,

« heat flux and delta T in exchanger,
uranium concentration,

radiation level at pump,

. power density in core vessel, and
thorium concentration.

ON BEAN PO

The design of the test reactor will require a compromise among these variables.
It seems desirable to sacrifice thorium concentration first. Using RDR-1 data
for a basis, an eight foot core with 1% ThF) will go critical at a U- 235 con=-
centration of 12.5 x 1019 atoms /cc. This concentration will render a five foot
core critical when no thorium is present, and the critical mass will be about

85 kg. A concentration of 36 x 10 19 atoms /cc would make a four foot core criti-
cal, with a critical mass of about 130 kg.

A blanket three to six inches thick should suffice to test the relisbility
of the core vessel. In the case of a six inch blanket on a five foot core, if |
the core vessel failed and the system were operated as 8 one region reactor, the
critical concentration would fall to about 4 x 1019, and the critical, mass
would be about 50 kg. Adding about 3/8 mole per cent thorium would raise the
critical: concentration back to 12 x 1019, and the critical mass to 140 kg.
