FOREWORD

This quarterly progress report of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Project at ORNL records
the technical progress of the research on circulating-fuel reactors and all other ANP research at
the Laboratory under its Contract W-7405-eng-26. The report is divided into three major parts:
I. Reactor Theory, Component Development, and Construction, Il. Materials Research, and
tl. Shielding Research.

The ANP Project is comprised of about 510 technical and scientific personnel engaged in
many phases of research directed toward the achievement of nuclear propulsion of aircraft. A
considerable portion of this research is performed in support of the work of other organizations
participating in the national ANP effort. However, the bulk of the ANP research at ORNL is
directed toward the development of a circulating-fuel type of reactor.

The design, construction, and operation of the Aircraft Reactor Test (ART), with the coopera-
tion of the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Division, are the specific objectives of the project. The
ART is to be a power plant system that will include a 60-Mw circulating-fuel reflector-moderated
reactor and adequate means for heat disposal. Operation of the system will be for the purpose
of determining the feasibility, and the problems associated with the design, construction, and

" operation, of a high-power, circulating-fuel, reflector-moderated aircraft reactor system.

SUMMARY

"PART I. REACTOR THEORY, COMPONENT
DEVELOPMENT, AND CONSTRUCTION
I Reflector. Moderated Reactor Co

 

A contract was awarded on August 19, 1955, to > the
Vv. L. Nichol son ‘Company, Knoxville, Tennessee,
the low bidder for package 1 of the Aircraft Reactor

Test (ART) facility. Their low bid of $765,835

included $264,373 for the reactor cell, with the
Chicago Bridge & Iron Co. engaged to serve as

‘the subcontractor to design, fabricate, and erect

the cell, Package 1 includes, in addition to the
cell, the major modifications of Building 7503.
Recent experiments at the Tower Shielding
Facility (TSF) emphasized the need for shielding
data from the ART, and therefore a layout has been
completed to provide for the measurement of the
gamma-ray spectrum of the ART as a function of
the angle of emission from the reactor shield
‘surface, oo
Layout drawings have been completed for the
principal features of the ART reactor—pump—heat
exchanger—pressure shell assembly, and the de-
tails are considered to be sufficiently firm for

procurement to be started. Fabrication of the

shells, such as the ‘pressure shell, reflector
shell, etc., will be particularly time-consuming

"because of die problems, and therefore procurement

‘work began with the shells.

A one-half-scale’ plastic model of the pump and. a

  
 
  

expansion tank region at the top of the reactor
been completed to facilitate examination of fabr

cation, stress, and fluid-flow problems, and ‘work

has started on a full

 
 

sign for the fuel-to-NaK ‘heat exchanger has been

    
  
 
 
 

selected. Design calculations and layout drawings _

charge tangentially into the core to give a system
that is insensitive to the one-pump-out condition,
Tests performed to date were planned fo assist in
the systematic development of an inlet-guide-vane
and turbulence-generator design that will produce
radial velocities of sufficient magnitude to keep
the boundary-layer fluid mixed with the free stream,
High-speed photographs of dye injections and con-
ductivity measurements of salt injections are being
used to examine radial flow, circumferential dis-
tribution, and transients, Core designs with lower
degrees of divergence than that of the present
21-in, design are being studied to determine the
effect of inlet annulus dimensions on the adverse
pressure gradients encountered by the fuel in
flowing from the core inlet to the equator.

Performance tests of the fuel pump with water as
the circulated fluid were completed. The noise
present in the initial testing was found to result
from a local flow condition that existed at the
tongue of the pump volute. A modification of the
volute design has eliminated the noise, and other
impeller modifications have brought about a con-
dition in which the hydraulic force balance on the
impeller occurs near design speed and flow. The
tests have demonstrated that the design point lies
in the region of maximum efficiency.

A flow sheet has been prepared that shows,
schematically, the locations of the principal
instrumentation and control components of the

ART, “and control ‘panel layout studies are being
_ made. Except for special sensing equipment, it
) appears ‘that no development ‘work will be required,
A construction program for the Engineering Test

has. been established, with a target

: B;°C ina copper matrix (30 vol % B,C), the burnup

penetration would be one-sixth as great as that in
a europium oxide cermet, but the heat produced
‘would be one-third greater. The boron layer be-
© tween the reflector and the fuel-to-NaK heat ex-

changer was examined with respect to heat genera-

‘tion, flux attenuation, helium gas evolution, and
burnup. Also, the differences between the ART
and the high-temperature critical experiment were
“evaluated. It is estimated that the critical con-
"centration of the ART will be between 4.6 and 5.4

. Experimental Reactor Engineering

The first Toop “Yor circulating fluoride fuel in
hole HB-3 of the MTR was shipped to NRTS on
June 20. It successfully passed the preoperational
checks, and startup of the loop proceeded satis-
factorily to the final step, that is, melting of the
freeze line and filling of the loop with the fuel
mixture. The heater for the freeze line was found
to be inoperable, and therefore the experiment was
terminated, The loop has been returned to ORNL
and disassembled. The modifications required to
overcome the difficulties encountered have been
incorporated in a second loop that is nearly ready
for shipment to NRTS. A third loop is also being
fabricated, The auxiliary facilities required at the
MTR for operation of the in-pile loop were com-
pleted, including a loop retractor mechanism for
adjustment of the loop nose position during reactor
operation,

Twenty-two fused-salt—Inconel forced-circulation
loops were operated in the test program for studying

‘corrosion and mass-transfer in high-temperature

differential, high- velocity systems under conditions
that simulate reactor flow rates and temperatures.
Nine similar loops were operated with sodium in
Inconel or in stainless steel tubing.

A new test loop has been designed with which

“it will be possible to obtain accurate information

Loooon the oxygen content of sodium or NaK during
ne operation of the loop. The main loop of the system

is to include a bypass cold trap and a sampling

  

 

and analyzing device, and an auxiliary plugging-
indicator loop will be attached to the main loop.
Also, a loop has been designed, in which NaK will
be circulated, that has the same ratio of surface
area to volume as that of the primary NaK circuits

of the ART.

The design layouts for two loops for high-
temperature tests of full-scale models of the ART
fuel and sodium pumps were completed, and fabri-
cation and assembly were started. The first group
of bearing-and-seal and mechanical tests on the
rotary elements of the pumps was completed. In
‘general, the test results indicate that the bearing-
and-seal designs for the upper and lower units can
be made to function satisfactorily. One short-
circuit pump-test stand was completed and shake-
down tests with water were started.

Intermediate heat exchanger test stand A was

operated for 690 hr in a series of furnace and

diffusion cold-trap tests of the NaK circuit and a
2-hr cleaning cycle of the fluoride-fuel circuit.
The gas-fired furnace for heating the NaK proved
to be capable of transferring 1.13 Mev of heat to
the NaK after minor modifications, including in-
stallation of a larger burner, had been made.
After the fuel mixture had been circulated and
dumped, a leak occurred in one tube bundle of the
heat exchanger, and subsequently one of the
NaK-to-air radiators developed a leak. The leak
in the heat exchanger was found to be a radial
crack on the inside of a tube bend. It was also
found that severe distortion had occurred as a
result of the thermal cycling created by operating
the heat exchanger with NaK in the tubes but with-
out fuel around the tubes. The temperature dif-
ferences thus created ranged from 200 to 1000°F,
The failure of the radiator is also thought to be the
result of extreme thermal cycling, but the analyses
of the difficulties have not yet been completed.
‘Additional test assemblies are being fabricated.

The first series of tests were completed on a
small (20-tube bundle) heat exchanger that was
operated nearly continuously for 1560 hr. Heat
transfer, pressure drop, and corrosion and mass-
transfer data were obtained. No appreciable

amount of mass transfer could be detected by

visual inspection, and metallurgical examination
is under way. The oxide content of the NaK was
found to be high, and therefore cold traps are to be
installed in subsequent test loops.

A one-fourth-scale model of the lower half of the

The fuel concentration in the room-temperature

critical assembly of the reflector-moderated circu-

[ating-fuel reactor was decreased from 0.416 (3%
excess reactivity) fo 0.345 g of y23s per cubic

a centimeter of fuel region, and a ‘‘clean’’ critical

mass of 19.9 kg of U23% was obtained. Two
structural changes’ in the assembly were also
studied. In one of the modifications, the average

‘width of one of the end ducts was increased from

1.29 to 2. 80 in., which increased its volume al-

“most 2.5 times. The corresponding critical mass

was about 24 kg of U235, In the other alteration,

the radius af the center of the beryllium island

was increased from 5.18 to 7. 19 in. The critical

use with circulating-fuel reactors,

Preliminary studies were made of the NaF-RbF-
ZrF UF, system to determine whether it could
provide a low-viscosity fuel. Previous work on the
RbF-ZrF, system had demonstrated the need for a
fourth component in order fo obtdin a low-melting
fuel with 20 to 40 mole % ZrF ,. All the work was
carried out with RbF which contained about 20
mole % KF as an impurity. The KF caused un-
expected results in the phase diagram work, which
has therefore been postponed until better RbF can
be procured. Viscosity measurements in the sys-
tem RbF- -ZrF ,- UF, (48-48-4 mole %) below 600°C
were hindered by particulate matter, but the
measurements made above 600°C gave viscosity
values which were somewhat lower than those in
the NaF-ZrF -UF, system. In order to obtain
further insight into the mixtures containing rubidium,
studies were made in the KF- -ZrF, and NaF-KF-
ZtF, systems. The latter system proved fo be
much more complex than either the NaF-ZrF ,-UF
or NaF-LiF-UF, systems, which show no ternary
compounds. The NaF-KF-ZrF, system was shown
to have at least five ternary compounds.

In the system NaF-LiF-BeF, it was found that
acceptably low melting points can be obtained with
low LiF concentration by moving into the ternary
system along the drainage path leading from the
NaF-Na,BeF, eutectic toward the LiF-Na,BeF
eutectic. In order to obtain-a melt with a kinematic
viscosity as low as that of the ARE-type fuel, it
was established that the BeF, content cannot be

than those of fuels with greater concentrations of
ZrF,. The equilibrium iron value remained about
the ‘same as that of fuels made with NaF- ZF,
mixtures and the NaF-LiF-KF eutectic, but its
temperature coefficient was reversed to give
slightly higher values at 800°C than at 600°C.
Data were obtained on the stability of iron fluorides
and chromium fluorides in various fused materials.

Reductions of UF, with excess uranium were
carried out in several melts. In the NaF-LiF
eutectic the UF, was more stable in copper than
in nickel equipment. In the NaF-KF-LiF eu-
tectic the stability of UF; was ‘independent of
the container, and, with *copper containers, a
uranium- copper alloy was found. This alloying
with copper did not occur with either NaF-LiF

eutectic or BeF, melts.

Workable methods have been devised for re-
processing fuel used in component testing at
ORNL and Pratt & Whitney. It is expected that
2000 to 3000 Ib will soon be available each month
for reprocessing and re-use. Since a satisfactory
commercial source of ZrF, has not yet been found,
a unit is being fabricated which is capable of pro-
ducing 1000 Ib of ZrF, per week by direct low-
temperature hydrofluorination of ZrCli ,.

A shortage of ZrF, reduced operation of the
large-scale (250-1b batch) fluoride-processing facil
ity to one-half the normal capacity during this
quarter. A total of 6960 Ib of purified fluoride
compositions was produced, including the fuel
carrier for the ART high-temperature critical ex-
periment. Pilot-scale equipment was used to pro-
duce 53 batches of purified fluorides. Enriched
fuels were prepared for the high-temperature
critical and in-pile loop experiments.

5. Corrosion Research

Examinations were made of several Inconel
forced-circulation loops operated with NaF-ZrF ,-
UF, (50-46-4 mole %) as the circulated fluid for
various times under otherwise identical conditions.
These loops, which were direct-resistance heated,
had a temperature differential of 200°F, a Reynolds
number of 10,000, a maximum fluid temperature of
1500°F, and a maximum wall temperature of 1600
to 1625°F. A curve obtained by plotting depth of
attack vs operating time exhibited the two-stage
type of attack found previously in thermal-convection
loops; that is, the initial rapid attack that occurred
while chemical equilibrium was being established
and the impurities were reacting was followed by
the slower mass-transfer type of attack. An at-
tack rate of 3 to 4 mils per 1000 hr was found for
the second stage of attack. In two similar loops
operated under the same conditions, except that
one was heated in a gas furnace and the other was
heated by electrical resistance of the tubing, the
depth of attack was not found to be affected by the
heating method. Another similar loop with a maxi-
mum wall temperature approximately 100°F higher

than the usual 1600 to 1625°F showed heavy sub-

surface-void attack to a depth of 18 mils. Thus

additional evidence was obtained that the wall
temperature is a more critical’ variable than is the

fluoride mixture temperature,

thick, in contrast to a 9-mil-thick layer found in an
Inconel loop with a stainless steel cold leg.

In an effort to ascertain the cause of the erratic
results being obtained with Inconel thermal-
convection loops, several loops were cleaned by
different methods and then operated with NaF-
ZtF UF, as the circulated fluid. No effects
attributable to the cleaning method could be
found. In other tests, heat was applied by direct
electrical resistance of the wall rather than by the
usual “clamshell” eleciric heaters. The results
confirmed a previous conclusion that the depth of
attack was not affected by the method of heating.
Since the forced-circulation loops had indicated
that the maximum loop wall temperature was a
significant variable, thermocouples were installed
on the hot legs of two standard Inconel thermal-
convection loops to study this effect. Preliminary
results indicate that the wall temperatures may
have been as much as 1670°F, in contrast to wall
temperatures of about 1600°F in the forced-circu-
lation loops, The higher temperature difference
between the wall and the fluid may account for the
attack in the thermal-convection loops being deeper
than in the forced-circulation loops.

A series of thermal-convection loops have also
been operated with small applied potentials, The
loop which circulated NaF-ZrF ,-UF , for 2000 hr
with a positive charge applied to the hot leg showed
only about one-half the depth of attack found in
the loop operated with a negative charge applied
to the hot leg. With a negative hot leg the attack
was about the same as that with no applied po-
tential. Inconel thermal-convection loops operated
with sodium gave results which confirmed those
obtained with forced-circulation loops.

Hot-pressed metal-bonded tungsten carbide
cermets were tested in NaF-ZrF UF, and in

sodium in seesaw apparatus; no measurable attack

was found on any specimens, Similar additional
tests were made of the Kentanium cermets. The

sodium, and several brazing alloys on Inconel and
- on stainless steel were tested in static lithium.
~All ‘the brazing alloys tested showed poor corrosion
"resistance to lithium.

A static test of a Hastelloy B specimen in an
Inconel capsule containing a fluoride mixture
showed the Hastelloy B to be unattacked, but the
Inconel was attacked to a depth of 8 mils, in con-
trast fo a normal attack to a depth of 2 mils in a
static Inconel capsule without the Hastelloy B
specimen,

Experiments are under way with a boiling-sodium—
Inconel system so that the effect of oxide-free
sodium on mass transfer can be studied. In pre-
liminary experiments no mass transfer could be
detected.

Seesaw corrosion tests have been made on
Inconel capsules loaded with sodium-potassium-
lithium mixtures in which the lithium content was
varied from 2 to 30 wt %. The heaviest attack was
found in the hot section of each tube, and it varied
from 0.5 mil in the presence of 10% lithium to 2 to
3 mils in the presence of 5% lithium. Molybdenum,
vanadium, and niobium were tested in static
lithium at 1500°F, Molybdenum was unattacked,
niobium was only slightly attacked, and vanadium
showed grain-boundary penetration by an uniden-
tified phase to a depth of 2 mils.

Measurements of the oxidation rate of metallic
sodium at 25 and 48°C were extended to periods of
2 x 10* min. The data obtained do not fit any of
the postulated oxidation-rate theories, although
highly protective oxide films were formed.
Measurements of the oxidation rate of metallic
columbium confirmed the previously reported change
in rate law with time. Tentative conclusions have
been drawn ‘concerning the origin of the change.

Improvements in technique have been made for
‘studying fused sodium hydroxide by spectrophoto-

metric techniques, Measurements of corrosion in
fused sodium hydroxide have shown that water
vapor is an important inhibitor and that the pres-
ence or absence of a closed electrical circuit be-
tween the hot and cold parts of the corroding
system has a significant effect on mass transfer.

Measurements of the self-dissociation of sodium
hydroxide have been made for the first time in the
absence of side reactions. Both the expected
decomposition into water and sodium oxide and
the postulated decomposition to produce hydrogen
have been confirmed.

A series of studies of the four-component fual
NaF-LiF- “ZF, -UF , (22-37.5-35.2-5 mole %) exposed
for 100 hr in sealed capsules of Inconel in the
standard rocking furnace have indicated that this
mixture may be less corrosive than others being
considered, A series of mixtures of the NaF-KF-
LiF eutectic with UF, and UF, added were also
tested in Inconel in the rocking-furnace apparatus.
The data indicate that UF; is quite unstable under
these conditions, regardless of the original UF ,-
to-UF, ratio. It also appears that considerable
disproportionation of UF, must be expected in this
sy stem.

In experiments for determining the effect of
chromium on the mass transfer of nickel in NaOH,
it was not obvious that the chromium was particu-
larly beneficial. However, it was shown that some
mechanism for preventing the loss of hydrogen
from the system —~ perhaps cladding the nickel
with some metal impervious to “hydrogen —- might
be quite beneficial.

6. Metallurgy and Ceramics

Mechanical property investigations of Inconel
have continued with stress-rupture tests of Yin.
tubing in argon and in fused salts at 1300, 1500,
and 1650°F. A comparison of creep-rupture dnd
tube-burst data showed similar rupture times for
0.060-in.-wall tubing and 0.060-in.-thick sheet in
argon and in NaF-ZrF -UF, (50-46-4 mole %) at
1500°F. The data being obtained indicate that
the presence of an axial stress in the tubing does
not appreciably affect the time to failure. Data
obtained for tubing with 0.010-, 0.020-, and
0.040-in. walls show, in comparison with data for
0.060-in.-wall tubing, that the thinner the wall the
shorter the rupture life at comparable stresses.

An evaluation test in fused-salt fuel of an

Inconel bellows with a welded diaphragm showed

only normal corrosion attack in the weld areas
and no cracks that resulted from flexing of the
bellows, A determination of the extent of inter-
action between beryllium and Inconel in contact
at high temperatures in an inert environment was
made. The results indicated that an intermetallic
layer was formed that would be detrimental to the
load-carrying capacity of the Inconel, This in-
formation was needed in the design of the high-
temperature critical experiment,

Additional tests were made of nickel-molybdenum
alloys containing titanium, aluminum, vanadium,

 

 
 

‘zirconium, columbium, or chromium which con-

firmed the previously reported embrittlement of
these ternary alloys after a long heat treatment at
elevated temperatures in hydrogen. The ductility
of the alloy can be restored by a high-temperature
anneal in vacuum. In the study of factors affect-
ing the fabricability of Hastelloy B, it was found
that canning the extrusion billets with Inconel
reduced the pressure required during the extrusion
and at the same time clad the alloy tubing with a
heat-resistant alloy.

"A series of creep-rupture tests of solution-
annealed, 0.060-in.-thick, Hastelloy B sheet at
1500 and 1650°F in NaF-ZrF 4-UF, (50-46-4 mole
%) were completed and design curves were pre-
pared. The influence of aging heat treatments on
the creep-rupture properties of Hastelloy B is

being studied in the range 1300 to 1800°F in

argon. The creep-rupture properties at 1800°F

‘are not substantially affected by aging, since at

this temperature a single-phase alloy exists. How-
ever, at 1500°F a second phase appears to exist
in aged specimens which increases the rupture
life at high stresses. Short-time tensile tests

"conducted after long-time aging of cold-worked

Hastelloy B af high temperatures indicate that

“résidual stresses from the cold-working operation

are quite detrimental to ductility. Data showed
the ductilities of cold-worked specimens to be
considerably lower than those of specimens an-
nealed before aging. Microstructural studies indi-
cate that cold work induces precipitation in larger
quantities and perhaps in smaller particles than
does annealing.

‘Additional oxidation-resistance tests of high-
temperature brazing alloys were conducted, and
melting-point studies are being made by using
sintered, conical samples. Experiments are under
way in an attempt to find an alloy for brazing a
boron carbide’ compact’ to an Inconel envelope.

after the development of experimental techniques
for minimizing distortion, The fabrication of a
third, 500-kw, NaK-to-air radiator is under way.
The design of the radiator is essentially the same
as that used previously, but improved fabrication
techniques are being utilized, Presintered rings
are to be used for the preplacement of brazing
dlloy. One tube bundle of the fuel-to-NaK inter-
mediate heat exchanger No. 3 has been completed,
and construction of the second tube bundie is under
way. Design modifications for this heat exchanger
have included the use of larger diameter tubing
(0.250 in.) and the elimination of right-angle
corners of header components to provide better
stress distribution. A second liquid-metal-to-air
radiator was fabricated for the Cornell Aeronautical
Laboratory.

An eddy-current method for flaw detection in
low-conductivity tubing is being investigated.
Studies have shown that an ultrasonic method for
the inspection of small-diameter tubing is suf
ficiently sensitive to detect the types of flaws
encountered to date.

Corrosion-erosion in graphite-hydrogen systems
at 2400°C, with a hydrogen velocity of Mach 0.15,
is being investigated. Present indications are
that the slight weight losses observed were due to
the small amounts of water vapor in the gas,

Two rare-earth-oxide control rod assemblies were
prepared for critical experiments; flux-detector
spacers of calcium fluoride and alumina were pro-
duced; dysprosium oxide disks were prepared for
use in measuring thermal flux; and a method for
preparing europium oxide wafers was investigated.
A study of the feasibility of synthesizing Mo, B
ond B,C was started, and the optimum pressing
conditions for pelletizing fluoride fuels are being
determined.

Investigations of diffusion barriers for use be-
tween Inconel and columbium have shown only
tantalum and copper to be useful. Tests for de-
termining the more satisfactory of the two barrier

materials are under way. Mixtures of columbium

and UO, being considered for use as fuel elements
were tested at 1500 and 1832°F for 100 hr. A
solid solution of Cb-U and a pinkish phase, as yet

unidentified, formed in the samples.

The deformation patterns obtained in two- and
three-ply extrusions of metal tubing were studied,
and limits were established on the metal ratios

and on the configurations of the billets that can be
successfully extruded. The creep performance of
lead-calcium was found to depend upon the care
with which the master alloys were made. This
implies that an accurate knowledge of the amount
of alloyed calcium rather than total calcium is
required. Therefore, chemical analyses, which
give a measure of the total calcium, were found to
be an unreliable index for predicting the creep
properties of the alloy.

The fabrication of boron-containing materials
for use as neutron shielding is being studied. At
present, attempts are being made to thermally bond
boron-containing layers to Inconel. The use of
B,C tiles is also being considered for locations
where thermal bonds. are not necessary.

7. Heat Transfer and Physical Properties

Forced-convection heat transfer measurements
were made for molten NaF- KF-LiF-UF, (11.2-41-
4532.5 mole %) which was flowing furbulently
through type 316 stainless steel tubes. The re-
sults were comparable with those obtained pre-
viously in an Inconel tube and were thus 40% below
the general turbulent-flow heat transfer correlation.
A check on the experimental apparatus was ob-
tained by operating it with water as the heat trans-
fer medium, and the data were in good agreement
with the general turbulent-flow correlation. The
low heat transfer values obtained with NaF-KF-
LiF-UF , therefore appear to be real.

The heat transfer and friction characteristics of
a full-scale model of the ART heat exchanger
were determined with and without the presence of
tube spacers. These results were compared with
conventional heat transfer and friction relations
for simple duct systems. As was to be expected,
both the heat transfer coefficients and the friction
factors decreased upon removal of the tube spacers.
However, when the spacers were removed, the
tubes were not held rigidly and channeling occurred
in the flow pattern,

A ‘summary of hydrodynamic research on models
of the 18- and 21-in. ART cores has been pre-

‘pared. Rotational and axial flow patterns, as

well as various entrance conditions, were studied,
One core, which had a low ratio of flow cross-
sectional area at the equator to flow cross-sectional
‘ared at the inlet, was characterized by uniform and
steady flow.

The temperature distributions within fluids flow-
ingthrough converging and diverging channels were

experimentally determined in the volume-heat-
source system, Information on the transient be-
havior of the wall temperatures, as well as on the
asymmetry of wall temperature profiles, was ob-
tained for these uncooled channels. A report has
been prepared which describes applications to
general convection problems of previously de-
veloped mathematical temperature solutions for
forced-convection systems having volume heat
sources within the fluids.

The enthalpies and heat capacities of LiF-KF
(50-50 mole %) were determined in the liquid and
solid states. The viscosities of eight fluoride
mixtures were determined. A mixture of RbF and
LiF (57-43 mole %) yielded a viscosity of 9.0
centipoises at 500°C and 3.4 centipoises at 650°C,
An RbF counterpart of the ART fuel was formu-
lated, This mixture, whose composition is RbF-
ZtF ,-UF, (48-48-4 mole %), had a viscosity of
9.5 centipoises at 550°C and 3.1 centipoises at
850°C. Its kinematic viscosity was found to be
about 20% lower than that of the corresponding
NaF-ZrF ,-UF , mixture.

8. Radiation Damage

The high-temperature forced-circulation fluoride-
fuel loop recently operated in a horizontal beam
hole in the LITR was examined metallographically.
Corrosion of the Inconel tubing by the circulating
fluoride-fuel mixture was found to be low and to
be substantially the same as that found previously
in capsules exposed in the MTR. No increases in
corrosion attack because of irradiation and no
other unusual effects were found. In the portion of
the loop that showed the maximum corrosion, the
average penetration was 1 mil and the maximum
was 2.5 mils. In general, the changes in the
Inconel were those expected in specimens sub-
jected to the heat treatment imposed by operation
of the loop. The average corrosion for the entire
loop was 0.5 mil, and no deposits of mass-trans-
ferred material were found. The fuel circulated
in this loop was NaF-ZrF +UF, (62.5-12.5-5
mole %). The fission power generated in the
fuel was calculated to be 2.8 kw, and the maximum
power density was 0.4 kw/cm3,

The miniature in-pile loop was operated in a
vertical position in the LITR, but the experiment

was terminated after about 30 hr because a faulty

pump motor prevented the maintenance of steady
fuel flow. The test was incomplete as a corrosion
study, but it was possible to make a fairly thorough

study of the in-pile characteristics of the loop.
The necessary design modifications are being
made, and a new loop is being fabricated,

" The Reactor Experimental Review Committee
has approved the insertion of the pressurized
stress-corrosion apparatus in HB-3 in the LITR,
and specimen assemblies for a series of tests are
being filled with fuel. Bench tests are in progress
on an apparatus for insertion in the MTR that is
designed to test creep in two nonfuel atmospheres.
An MTR (tensile) creep test apparatus irradiated
during two reactor cycles is being returned to
ORNL for postirradiation measurements, The
bench equivalent of this apparatus has been
assembled and tests have been started.

The maximum high-energy neutron flux in HB-3
of the MTR was measured to be 3.1 x 10'3 fast
neutrons/cm2.sec, and the thermal-neutron flux
was found to be 2.3 x 1014 neutrons/cm2.sec. A
flux-depression experiment in HB-3 indicated a
lack of sensitivity of flux depression to the kind
of nuclear absorber used. The power to be ex-
pected in the MTR in-pile loop was estimated from
the measurements to be 31 to 36 kw.

Analyses of reactor-grade beryllium obtained from
The Brush Beryllium Co. and the R. D, MacKay
Company showed that the predominant source of
gamma activity after long irradiation followed by a
few days decay is Sc48, The quantity of scandium
present is so small that it cannot be found by
chemical analyses with a limit of detection of

200 ppm.

‘9. Analytical Chemistry of Reactor Materials

Modifications of the n-butyl bromide method for
the determination of oxygen in sodium were evalu-
ated. The modifications included the addition of
a column of silica gel and diatomaceous earth
for the rapid purification and desiccation of re-
agents and an improved apparatus in which the
reaction between sodium and butyl bromide could
be carried out in an atmosphere of argon, Although
the oxygen content of the majority of the samples

which were “used in testing ‘these modifications
was in excess of 200 ppm, concentrations of the
order of 20 to 40 ppm of “oxygen were found in

specially prepared sodium, -

“Tests were made of the method for the determina-

tion of oxygen in sodium by titration of the Na,0. -

that remains after vacuum distillation of the sodium
metal, An apparatus was constructed that was
similar to one developed by the Argonne National

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1955

Laboratory. Preliminary results on sodium sampled
at 1200°F showed an oxygen content of the order
of 50 ppm. Since samples of sodium at high tem-
peratures can be obtained with this apparatus and
since low levels of oxygen can be detected, the
apparatus is to be attached directly to a forced-
circulation  high-temperature-differential sodium
loop so that analyses can be carried out during
operation of the loop.

Development of a volumetric method for the de-
termination of zirconium in fluoride salts was
completed, In this method zirconium is converted
to a stable complex by the addition of an excess
of disodium dihydrogen ethylenediaminetetraacetate
(EDTA) to a dilute H,SO, solution containing
zirconium, The excess EDTA is titrated with
trivalent iron to a disodium-1,2-dihydroxybenzene-
3,4-disulfonate end point at a pH of 4.8. Titration
can be conducted in the presence of as much as
0.1 M of fluoride ion by first complexing the
fluoride ion with beryllium, Slight modifications
in the procedure make the method also applicable
to the determination of zirconium in the presence
of moderate amounts of irivalent iron, divalent
nickel, and trivalent chromium.

The apparatus for the determination of uranium
metal in mixtures of fluoride salts by decomposi-
tion of the hydride in an atmosphere of oxygen at
reduced pressures was modified to include two
combustion tubes so that one sample can be oxi-
dized while a second is being converted to the
hydride,

Analytical assistance was given in a study of
the rate of elimination of atmospheric gases from
a dry box with argon, The most efficient flushing
action was found to be the fairly rapid injection of
argon at the bottom of the dry box, without supple-
mentary agitation, With an argon flow rate of 25
cth, the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere
of a 21-ft3 dry box was reduced by a factor of 100
by flushing with two volumes of argon.

Investigation was continued of the application
of the bromination method to the determination of

“oxygen in ZrF, and its mixtures with alkali-metal

fluoride salts. Incomplete removal of oxygen was

"observed for samples of pure ZrO, after bromina-

tion for 6 hr at 950°C,

“In the bromination method for the determination
of oxygen in metal oxides, the oxygen is converted
to CO and then oxidized to co, for measurement,
A method for the direct measurement of CO was
studied in which the CO is absorbed in an aqueous

solution of PdCl, and KCl. The net increase in
hydrogen ion concentration of this solution is a
function of the CO present. Excellent titration
curves were obtained only when an amount of KI
in excess of the PdCl, present was added to the
solution prior to titration with a standard base.

10. Recovery and Reprocessing of Reactor Fuel

"A review of the design and construction prob-
lems involved in the completion of the pilot plant
for the recovery of fused-salt fuels has indicated
that a construction completion date near the end
of February 1956 will be more realistic than the
December 1955 date given previously, An engi-
neering flow sheet was issued, and approximately
65% of the process equipment items are on hand
of are in some stage of procurement or fabrication,

The dump tank containing the ARE fuel was
moved, uneventfully, from the ARE building to
the pilot plant building. Methods have been de-

vised for removing the fused salt from the dump

tank and from other types of containers for charg-
ing into the fluorination vessel,

Direct-resistance heating of transfer lines was
found to be satisfactory for preventing plugging,
except at fittings, where supplemental external
heating will be required. A freeze valve was de-
signed for closing the transfer lines to and from
the fluorinator, After 15 cycles of freezing and
thawing, this valve, when frozen, held against a
pressure of 20 psig without leaking.

An improved procedure for decontamination of the
UF, product of the fluorination step was developed
which involves the absorption of the UF, on NaF
at 100°C and desorption by heating to 400°C, with
the product gas passing through a second bed of
NaF before collection of the UF, in a cold trap.
Since in this two-bed process, in contrast to the
previous process in which a single absorbent bed
was used, the fission products never enter the
product-collection system, decontamination factors
of greater than 10% were obtained in re-used equip-
ment, Preliminary results indicate that nitrogen
may be used as a sweep gas in both the fluorina-
tion and the NaF absorption and desorption steps
to reduce the amount of fluorine required for
processing,

PART lll. SHIELDING RESEARCH
11. Shield Design

A survey of the weights of spherically symmetric
unit shields for circulating-fuel reactors was made

10

for a range in dose rates of 0.1 to 10 rem/hr at a
distance of 50 ft and a range in reactor power of
100 to 300 Mw. An estimate was obtained for the
added weight of an NaK-to-NaK secondary heat
exchanger and its shielding, The additional weight
was found to vary sharply with the manner in
which the dose rate was divided between the

"secondary heat exchanger and the reactor and with

the absolute value of the sodium activation. The
chief sources of radiation in the 300-Mw circulating-
fuel reactor for the NJ-1 power plant were determined.

New data recently obtained at the TSF and the
LTSF are being used in a parametric shield weight
study for a 300-Mw circulating-fuel reactor in
which the important reactor dimensions are varied.
Differences between the shield test mockups and
the design reactors are accounted for on the basis
of the present understanding of the sources of
radiation in each. As a result, shield weight
dependence upon reactor and shield dimensions
and materials can now be calculated with greater
certainty. The results obtained to date indicate
that divided shield weights can be significantly
reduced by increased shield-shaping based upon

TSF and LTSF data and analyses.
12, Lid Tank Shielding Facility

The static source tests of the second series of
the circulating-fuel reflector-moderated-reactor and
shield (RMR-shield) mockup experiments have been
completed. The final tests included neutron and
gamma-ray measurements beyond the mockups to
determine the effect of placing an intermediate or
high atomic weight material immediately behind the
beryllium reflector, varying the thickness of the
reflector, and distributing the lead gamma-ray
shield in borated water,
RMR-shield, little, if any, weight saving results
from adding bismuth to the outer region of the
reflector rather than using lead in the shield, The
addition of a 2-in.-thick layer of copper in the
same region was insufficient fo effect an appreci-
able weight saving, but there was evidence that
there might be enough self-absorption of capture
gamma rays in a 4-in.-thick copper layer to show a
valuable weight saving. Varying the beryllium
thickness (8, 12, and 16 in.) did not have an
appreciable effect,

The study of distributing the lead gamma-ray
shield in borated water showed that, for lead
thicknesses up to 5 in., there would probably be

for use with the shield optimization studies of the
Tower Shielding Facility. It is felt that this }
analysis, which involves simple geometry, is

no weight saving as a result of distributing the
lead rather than placing it in one piece but that
there might be an appreciable weight saving as
a result of distributing the lead beyond the first
5-in. layer, The secondary gamma-ray dose rate
produced in the lead and borated-water shield fell
off at the same rate as the thermal neutron flux

"and thus was apparently caused by thermal-neutron

captures in the shield.

Sodium activation tests were performed to de-
termine the activation of the coolant in the heat
exchanger region as a function of the heat ex-
changer thickness, the boron curtain thickness and
distribution, and the reflector thickness. Results
of representative tests showed that the sodium
activation in the heat exchanger was increased in
going from a 4-in, thickness to a 6-in. thickness.
The probability of escape of the resonance neu-
trons was reduced by the increased thickness; the
probability may be increased, however, by dis-
tributing the boron curtain through the heat ex-
changer region. An increase in the reflector thick-
ness from 8 to 12 in. decreased the sodium acti-
vation by 80%. A gamma-ray shield of copper
placed between the beryllium reflector and the
first boron curtain increased the sodium activation
by a factor of about 6.

13. Bulk Shielding Facility

A part of the experiment designed for determining
the gross fission-product gamma-ray spectrum was
completed. Small samples of enriched uranium
were irradiated in the ORNL Graphite Reactor for
time intervals ranging from 1 to 8 sec, and the
gross fission-product photon spectrum was studied
by using the multiple-crystal gamma-ray spectrom-

eter, The decay of six energy groups, covering BN
the range of 0.28 to 5.0 Mev, was followed from
5 to 150 sec after fission. The total energy re-
lease per fission in the time ‘interval and energy

range described was found to be about 1.5 Mev.

Additional measurements of fast-neutron dose a:
a function of angle’ in a water shield’ have be
The resulting data were analyzed

more meaningful than that reported in the pre-
vious ANP Quarterly for which data obtained with
the GE-ANP mockup were used.

The angular-distribution measurements made on
the reactor center line at a distance of 70 cm

  
 

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1955

from the reactor were integrated, The integrated
dose (0.49 mrep/hrew) compared surprisingly well
with the total dose measured by the Hurst-type
dosimeter (0.52 mrep/hrew).

Measurements were also made through 70 cm of
water at a point 19.6 cm from the center line of
the reactor and through 5 cm of water on the center
line of the reactor. In all cases the measured dose
remained constant, within the statistical devia-
tion, when the collimator was pointed at the active
lattice of the reactor,

14. Tower Shielding Facility
The results of Phase | of the TSF differential

shielding experiments have been incorporated in
the development of a procedure for optimizing the
neutron shield of a divided aircraft shield. In this
optimization procedure the neutron shield at the
reactor is divided into N conical shells, The
thickness of the nth conical shell is then denoted
by T, (n=1,2,...,N). Thecrew shield is assumed
to be cylindrically shaped, with a rear thickness
T, and a front and a side thickness T_. The pro-
cedure then consists in (1) expressing both the
total weight of the neutron shield and the dose
rate at the center of the crew compartment as
functions of the T's, T,, and T; (2) using the
method of Lagrange multipliers to obtain the equa-
tions which the T's, T , and T_ must satisfy in
order that the weight be a minimum for a specified
total dose rate at the center of the crew com-
partment; and (3) developing an iterative procedure
for the solution of these equations.

There are still some gaps in the experimental
input data required for the optimization, Where it
has been feasible, these gaps have been filled by
extending the existing data by qualitative theoreti-

"cal considerations of the attenuation processes
“involved. An important limitation does exist, how-
“ever,” in the use of this optimization procedure,

In the TSF experiments, scattered dose rate meas-

_.Surements were “not taken for T or T, smaller

of water, Therefore, for T_ and

T, less than’ 5 cm, extrapolations must be Used.

Indications are that, for such small thicknesses,

“the relaxation lengths change appreciably; hence,
"it does not appear advisable to use the procedure
for a crew shield thickness of less than 5 cm of

water.

A neutron shield optimization calculation for a
typical reactor and shield configuration was made
by using the above procedure. This calculation

11

 

 

 
 

indicated that the procedure is quite satisfactory

and yields results which converge rapidly enough

for the solution to be obtained in a reasonable
length of time by hand calculation, In going from
the first to the third iteration, the weight of the
calculated shield, in this sample calculation, was
reduced from 11.3 to 9.6 tons,

12

A further investigation of the GE-ANP R1 re-
actor and crew shield mockups is under way.
Measurements of gamma-ray doses inside the crew
compartment mockup have been completed, and,
at present, a study of the distribution of gamma-ray
intensities in air around the reactor shield is
being made.

Recent tests made at the Tower Shielding
Facility indicated that provision should be made
for the measurement of the gamma-ray spectrum
of the ART as a function of the angle of emission
from the reactor shield surface. It was decided
that four collimated beams radiating from an
equatorial point at the surface of the water shield
at angles of from 0 to 70 deg from the radial
direction would serve to give the essential data.
One additional collimated radial beam will be
available from an equatorial point at the surface
of the reactor pressure shell; this beam will be
used only during low-power operation. The layout
required for providing these beams and the fa-
cilities for measuring them are shown in Fig. 1.1.

Core Flow Studies

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

Two approaches to the core hydrodynamics
problem are being investigated. Both make use

‘of a vortex sheet in the annulus between the
“island ‘and reflector in an effort to get a high
~~ degree of mixing. In the first system the vortex
“axes parallel the island, while in the second they

24

spiral helically downward around it. In both
systems the two fuel pump volutes discharge
tangentially into the core inlet to give a system
that is insensitive to the one-pump-out condition.

Eight series of tests have been made on the
axial vortex system in the metal core rig. The
tests constituted a systematic development of an
inlet-guide-vane and turbulence-generator design

‘which would produce radial velocities of sufficient

magnitude to keep the boundary-layer fluid mixed
with the free stream.

The results of tests of the core with inlet guide

ponent are presented in Fig. 1.6. The induced
axial pressure gradient was removed, and the
amount of flow reversal along the inner wall was
decreased. As in the first series, the flow was
essentially two-dimensional; that is, no appreci-
able radial component existed.

Turbulators were added to the previous con-

from Fig. 1.7 that the amount of flow reversal was
further reduced.

In another series of tests (series 8) flow re-

versal was eliminated from station 6 downward
by use of a greater radial velocity component.
The configuration of series 8 was used for two
brief tests that simulated the one-fuel-pump-out
condition. Preliminary results indicate that flow
conditions change very little, the percentage of

flow separation remaining approximately the same

as for the two-pump condition.

Data are taken from the metal core test rig by
means of wall static pressure taps and claw probe
traverses. The latter read total pressure and flow
direction but are limited to measuring flow which
is two-dimensional. As stronger turbulators are

designed and radial velocity components become
greater, accurate data will be increasingly more

Fig. 1.8. Transit Time for Flow Between Core Inlet and Outlet.

Studies were made of the flow of water through
the transparent plastic model by injecting a dye
at various points. The header, at the time of
these tests, was designed to produce two,
meshing, helical vortexes through the flow
chamber. Several combinations of chemicals for
imparting color changes were considered. The
most satisfactory one, by far, was a combination
of starch, iodine, and sodium thiosulfate. For the
tests the model was filled with a starch solution,
which was transparent prior to the injection of
the dye, the dye being an iodine solution (a
safurated solution of iodine in methyl alcohol).
After the dye was injected, transparency could
again be obtained in the closed system by the
injection of a clearing agent, The clearing agent
was a saturated solution of sodium thiosulfate in
water, The study was made by alternately in-
jecting the dye and the clearing agent. The dark
blue cloud resulting from the dye injection was

transported with the water. The general character-
“istics of the flow could be observed, and, in

particular, the flow at various points could be
noted. In one way the action of the clearing agent
was superior to that of the dye: those areas
where turbulence was least were the last ones

28

to be cleared of the dye. Photographs were taken
of the tests, but they have not yet been analyzed.

Visual observations indicated that the water
circulated about the vertical axis of the core, with
the greater portion of the mass making from four
to seven revolutions in passage. There was
upward flow in the upper hemisphere near the
island, but very good mixing appeared to prevail
throughout most of the core. An extensive series
of pictures of flow in both cores is scheduled for
completion in September.

Core Design Analyses

W. T. Furgerson
Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division
Interest in core designs with lower degrees of
divergence than that of the present 21-in. design

prompted a study of the effect of inlet annulus

dimensions on the adverse pressure gradients
encountered by the fuel in flowing from the core

inlet to the equator. Any core design in which

the area perpendicular to the flow increases along
the flow path will have adverse pressure gradients
resulting from conversion of velocity head to
static head. If the flow entering the core has a
rotational component, an additional axial pressure

gradient will be induced through fluid friction
effects. If the rotational component is centered
about the core axis, the induced gradient is
favorable along the outer wall and adverse along
the island. In each case, the gradient is algebrai-
cally additive to the gradients brought about by
area change. Since, all other things being equal,
flow separation is favored by higher relative
pressure gradients, the result is a tendency for
flow to separate from the island.

The effect of increasing the outside radius of
the present 21-in. core inlet on the two relative
pressure gradients along the island wall is illus-
trated in Fig. 1.9. The divergence gradient de-
creases because of the decreased divergence of
the core, but the induced gradient increases,
principally because of the increased ratio of inlet
radii,

radial. running clearance were discussed in the
previous report, !

Further study was made of the noise which was
~ present in the initial testing and which was
suspected to be cavitation noise. It has been
determined that the noise was not primarily due
to fluid cavitation but, rather, to a local flow
condition that existed at the tongue of the pump
volute. This was established by the use of a
carbon microphone probe. A circuit was devised
so ‘that the microphone signal could be observed
“on a cathode-ray oscilloscope. With this arrange-
ment, the region of maximum noise was located
near the volute tongue. The absence of cavitation
was further indicated by no observable decrease
in efficiency when the pump was operated at the
design point under conditions of varying pump
_suction pressure. The pump suction pressure was
‘varied from approximately 11 to 0 psig with a
"water ‘temperature of approximately 70°F. The
‘vapor ‘pressure of the water at 70°F corresponds
to that of fuel at a temperature of 1535°F, which
is well above the maximum fuel pump suction
temperature expected.

Analyses of the data from the pump performance
tests indicated the need for additional flow area
in the pump volute. The particular evidence for
this was the imbalance of hydraulic forces around
the periphery of the impeller at the design point
and the occurrence of design-speed maximum ef-
ficiency at approximately 20% less than the design
flow.

A design change in the reactor north head for
structural reasons allowed the pump volute flow
area to be increased; however, this increase did
not compensate for the increase in the fuel flow
rate required for improved heat exchanger per-
formance. To obtain the additional required flow
area, the pump volute was redesigned without
diffuser cones.

Results of water performance tests with the
redesigned pump volute indicated excessive re-
circulatory losses between the impeller discharge
“and suction volumes. The impeller lower shroud
was therefore modified to allow the 12 radial
~slingers to be lengthened to the full impeller
diameter in order to increase their developed back
pressure. The results of this modification are
shown i in Fig. I 11. To further reduce the re-

circulatory loss, the impeller axial clearance was
reduced from 0.102 to 0.053 in. The results of
this modification are shown in Fig. 1.12.

It may be seen from Fig. 1.12 that the design
point lies in the region of maximum efficiency.
The noise present with the earlier volute design
was eliminated, and the condition of hydraulic
force balance on the impeller occurs near design
speed and flow.

Controls and Instrumentation

J. M. Eastman
Bendix Products Division

E. R. Mann

Instrumentation and Controls Division

A flow sheet has been prepared that shows,
schematically, the locations of the instrumentation
and control components.  Control-panel layout
studies“are being made. Elementary-control elec-
trical wiring diagrams are being prepared to
provide control actions in accordance with infor-
mation block diagrams, which show control func-
tions independent of control techniques or hardware
types. The selection of control techniques and
the specifications for component hardware are
being worked out. Apparently no fundamentally
new development work, except for special sensors,
will be necessary to meet control requirements,
although heat load responses may require the use
of some controls not previously required for
reactors.

The linear equipment for an ORNL reactor
simulator has been assembled and tested. Com-
pletion of the nonlinear simulator equipment is
scheduled for September 1, 1955, with the delivery
of special components from Reeve Electronics,
Inc. One of the major objectives of the simulation
is the determination of the control system re-
sponse requirements under emergency conditions.

Two instrument test loops are being prepared
for checking special sensors, including thermo-
couples, flowmeters, pressure indicators, and the
tachometers. Arrangements are also being made
for testing the fuel-level indicator.

Conceptual designs have been worked out for
the rod-drive mechanism, the enricher actuating
and control mechanism, the moderator coolant
temperature control system, the flux-sensing
chambers, the radiator main louver actuating dnd
control mechanism, the fuel and sodium pump

are to develop assembly techniques for use on
the ART, to furnish some information on thermal
stresses in the reactor assembly, to obtain some

Calculations of control rod heating and burnup
to be expected in the ART were completed. The
rod designs considered included cylindrical annuli
of various rare-earth oxides, 1%-in. OD, either
%- or 1)-in, ID, and Y or % in. in annular
thickness. The maximum density of the heat
generated by gamma-ray absorption in the sin.
annulus was found to be about 140 w/cm3, of
which 15 w/em® was due to gamma rays produced
in the core; the remainder was due to neutron
capture gamma rays produced in the rod. The
heat generated in a %-in. annulus was found to
be about two-thirds of that generated in the Vein.
annulus. Temperatures in the rod material depend
on whether the rod is fabricated of fused oxide
or of a cermet, For a Y-in.-thick fused oxide rod,
the temperature rise is expected to be 620°F if
the rod is cooled at both the inner and the outer
surface and to be 2300°F if it is cooled only at
the outer surface. Corresponding temperature
rises for the cermet are very much smaller: 20
and 54°F, respectively, if the conductivity of the
cermiet is assumed to be the same as that of iron.
The heat fluxes are large: 140,000 Btu/ft2.he if
the rod is cooled at both surfaces, 230,000

Btu/ft2.hr if it is cooled at the outer surface

only.
The thickness of the poison material required

to allow for burnup by neutron absorption depends

on the abundance of high- cross-section isotopes
in the rare earth and on the density of the rare-
earth oxide, which would be greater for the fused
ceramic rod than for the cermet. Calculated pene-

trations for 500 hr at 60 Mw are tabulated below.
The cermet is assumed to be 33% oxide by volume.

For a sin. annular control rod of B;°C in
copper (30 vol % B,C), the burnup penetration
would be one-sixth as great as that in a europium
oxide cermet, but the heat produced would be
one-third greater. All these considerations are
based on a neutron current of 2.5 x 104
neutrons/cm2.sec into the rod.

ART Boron Layer
A. M. Perry

Electronuclear Research Division

The boron layer (assumed to be made of B,C
tiles) between the reflector and the fuel-to-NaK
heat exchanger was examined with respect to heat
generation, flux attentuation, helium gas evo-
lution, and burnup.? Heating will be largely due
to the alpha particles from the B1%(n,a)Li7 re-
action and will amount to about 13 w/cm? of tile
(40,000 Btu/ftZ-hr). The heat flux per unit area
will be one-half this amount, since both surfaves
of the tile will be adjacent to cooled surfaces;

thus the temperature rise for radiative heat -

transfer will be about 500°F. The absorption
mean free path of thermal neutrons (1200°F)

B;°C with a density of 2.5 g/cm? is 0.0017 in.,
while that of 3-kev neutrons (near the sodium
resonance) is 0.145 in, If the B}°C layer were
made 1 in. thick to absorb sodium resonance
neutrons, gamma-ray heating of the layer would
increase the total heat produced by only 30%.
The flux of about 4 x 1013 neutrons/cm?. s ec

absorbed over an area of 4 x 10% cm? yields a

theoretical helium gas evolution rate of 5

liters/day (STP). Burnup of the boron will be

only 1.2 mg/cm? of B'? in 500 hr at 60 Mw.

experiment and the ART with respect to the
factors that determine the critical concentration
of UF, in the fuel mixture. The differences that
may have a significant effect on the critical
concentration are: (1) control rod position: the
ART will be made critical with the control rod

inserted farther than it was in the high-temperature

critical experiment; (2) beryllium density: cooling

holes in the ART reflector will reduce the moder-
~ ator” density; (3) reflector poisoning: sodium
coolant in the reflector will increase neutron

absorptions in the reflector; (4) reflector size:
in order to minimize machining of beryllium for

‘the experiment, the reflector was made in an

irregular rectangular shape circumscribing the
design reflector and had a somewhat larger volume
than that of the ART reflector, The effects of
these differences are estimated in the following
paragraphs.

The ART will be made critical ot 1200°F with
the control rod withdrawn about 1.5% in Ak from
its fully inserted position. The control rod cali-
bration of the high-temperature critical experiment,
carried to a point 4 in. above the mid-plane of
the reactor, appears to be consistent with an
over-all rod value of about 5% in Ak. Thus, the
Ak inserted at critical will be about 3.5%. The
increment in concentration necessary to com-
pensate for the initial rod insertion is thus about
7 x 3.5, which is ~ 24%. The initial rod position,
of course, is, to some extent, at the discretion
of the operators, and the increment in critical
concentration could, if desired, be chosen to be
less than 24% — say 18 or 20% — to correspond
to an initial rod insertion of 2.5 to 3%.

Since the change in beryllium density is not
uniform, the cooling holes being more closely
spaced near the core, it is necessary to calculate
a weighted average density change. This was
done in two ways. From two-group perturbation
theory, the importance of a change in the fast-
group diffusion coefficient or in the group-transfer
cross section is approximately proportional to the
square of the fast flux. The quantity U(r) was
obtained by adding multigroup fluxes, and $2 was
used as a weighting function. An alternate

‘weighting function was obtained by computing the

slowing-down density by means of age theory.
In this case the weighting function at radius 7

is applied to the average density change in the

spherical shell between the core and the spherical

surface of radius r, rather than to the local density
change at 7. Average density changes computed
in these two ways are 4.2 and 3.5%, respectively.
The reactivity effects of a uniform density change
in beryllium have been computed by Curtiss-Wright
Corp. to be 0.42% in reactivity for 1% in density,?
and by Pratt & Whitney Aircraft to be 0.35% in
reactivity for 1% in density. Based on these
figures, an average reactivity change of -1.5%
is predicted. Data from the high-temperature
critical experiment indicate (AM/M)/(Ak/E) to be
about 7. Thus a change in critical concentration
of 10.5% is anticipated as a result of the reduction
of the beryllium density.

The effect of thermal-neutron absorptions in the
sodium coolant was estimated by comparing the
calculations of the Curtiss-Wright Corp.> for
Inconel-lined and unlined cooling holes. The
penalty in uranium concentration due to the
Inconel was reduced in the ratio of the macro-
scopic thermal neutron absorption cross sections
of the sodium and the Inconel. When allowance
was made for the greater number of cooling holes
presently planned for the ART, the increment of
fuel concentration required to compensate for the
sodium in the reflector was 5.6%.

The effect of the additional beryllium in the
reflector of the high-temperature critical experi-
ment has not yet been satisfactorily computed.
This is due, in part, to the irregular distribution
of the added beryllium ond, in part, to some
uncertainty regarding the dependence of reactivity
on reflector thickness. Whether the entire re-
flector volume is considered or only the portion
between two planes 1 ft above and below the
equatorial plane of the reactor, the beryllium in
the experimenf was about 3 in, thicker, on the
average, than the beryllium in the design reflector
of the ART. According to the parametric studies
of Curtiss-Wright Corp.,> such a decrease in
reflector thickness over the whole surface of a
spherical reactor would increase the critical con-
centration by a factor of 1.26. Results of the
cold critical experiments, however, indicate that
removing 3 in. of beryllium over the region ex-
tending 1 ft above and below the reactor mid-plane

should increase the concentration by about a
factor of 1.12. The true effect is believed to lie
between these extremes.

The over-all factor by which the critical con-
centration of the ART is likely to exceed that
of the high-temperature critical experiment is

obtained by multiplying the four factors together.

The result is
F = (1.2)(1.1)(1.06)(1.12) = 1.56 ,

if the low estimates for control rod allowance and
reflector size effect are employed, or

F = (1.25)(1.1)(1.06)(1.26) = 1.84 ,

if the high estimates are used. Since the clean
critical concentration of the experiment was 2.9
mole % UF, the critical concentration of the ART
is expected to fall between the limits 4.6 and
5.4 mole %. Some multigroup calculations are
to be undertaken, in the near future, which should
help to establish the critical concentration of the

ART somewhat more reliably,

A new multigroup, multiregion reactor calcu-
lation is being programed for the Cracle. By
taking the consistent P, approximation to the
Boltzmann equation, group equations have been
developed and lethargy dependent coefficients
have been put into a form suitable for coding. In
the treatment of thermal neutrons, both neutron
and moderator temperatures will be considered.
The theory for the inclusion of shells and for the
spatial integration of the group equations is the
same as that described previously.®

The code will compute fluxes as a function of
one space variable in slab, cylindrical, or
spherical geometry. As presently planned, it will
allow up to 125 groups and 125 regions. The
calculation may be iterated on the concentration
of any specified element to obtain a multiplication

‘constant of unity, and self-shielding factors will

be available, Adjoint fluxes may be computed,

IN-PILE LOOP DEVELOPMENT AND TESTS

Loop Installation

C. W. Cunningham
Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

The instrument panel for the MTR in-pile loop
was installed on the first level balcony on the
reactor north face. This location is advantageous
in that it is above the activity on the main floor
and relatively close to the HB-3 beam hole. Pro-
vision of a central balcony extension for the oper-
ator enabled him to easily observe the instrument
and control panel in the somewhat restricted space.
The additional instrument panels and cabinets
were located on balcony extensions at each end of
the instrument and control panel.

The auxiliary equipment and the loop, on its
cradle, were placed on the main floor, largely

36

under and adjacent to the east face stairway.
Interconnecting tubes and wires were protected
by running them in troughs hung beneath the bal-
cony and the stairway above head level. The
tubes and wires to the loop were lifted into these
troughs after the loop was inserted into the beam
hole.

A means for flux compensation had to be pro-
vided, since the flux profile at the HB-3 beam hole
was not known with certainty, A loop retractor
mechanism was built and was mounted in the HB-3
cubicle to permit withdrawal of the loop plug 6 in.
from the fully inserted position. This device
permits adjustment of the loop nose position in the
tapering flux region and, thus, variation of the
loop power level independently of reactor opera-
tion. The retractor also serves as a safety device.
By withdrawing the plug 6 in. and reducing the
process air flow, reactor operation could continue
in the event the in-pile loop experiment had to be
operated on the limited, emergency, cooling-air
supply. The ability to preset the position of the
plug greatly reduces the risk of freezing or over-
heating the loop during the reactor startup and
shutdown.

Orderly arrangement of lines and equipment in
the cubicle presented a difficult problem. The
lead shields, retractor mechanism, tubing cutoff
block, tubing and electrical wires, and hoses
almost completely filled the available cubicle
space. The problem was further complicated by
the movement required for retraction. A workable
arrangement was found by trial and error movement
of the lines and tubes into various coiled configu-
rations. The water hose had to be carefully routed
to eliminate excessive strain on the quick-discon-
nect fittings provided to eliminate the leakage of
radioactive process water,

Safeguards Committee, and it was then inserted
into the HB-3 beam hole from the special loading
cradle supplied as part of the experiment, Fuel
elements adjacent to the beam hole were removed
for the insertion, since no shielding was provided.
Although a rather high radiation beam was meas-
ured adjacent to the in-pile loop plug shield, it
was well collimated, and the insertion proceeded
rapidly and smoothly without the coffin,

The startup of the loop proceeded systematically
through pump operation and preheating of the fuel
and the piping. At the final step, melting of the
freeze line and charging of the loop, the heater for
the freeze line was found to be inoperable. An
internal short, to ground, had developed after the
preoperational checkout, Efforts to clear the short
were unsuccessful, and it was impossible to melt
the line by increasing the power to adjacent
heaters. This terminated the loop operation, and
the loop was removed from the beam hele for return
to ORNL. Since this loop had been reworked re-
peatedly during the initial assembly, it was deemed
to be irrepairable and was therefore cut up for
evaluation,

The short was found in a nipple, or extension,
from the pump bulkhead to the glass seal for the
power leads, Braided glass insulation had become
frayed, apparently during assembly, and the copper
lead wire was exposed. ‘Mechanical separation

Horizontal-Shaft Sump Pump
J. A. Conlin

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

The difficulties previously encountered with the
shaft seals of the horizontal-shaft sump pump have
been corrected. The original seal used a thin,
brass bellows, which failed mechanically, {it was
replaced with a stainless steel bellows, which
serves both as the flexible member of the seal
and the loading spring. It was necessary that the
bellows serve as the loading spring because the
combined spring loading of the steel bellows and
a spring would have been excessive. However,
the spring-loaded bellows caused chatter between
the graphite nose and the mating seal ring, and
the graphite crumbled. The installation of friction
dampers, in the form of spring-loaded steel plugs
that pressed radiqlly against the outside of the
seal nose, eliminated this difficulty.

The maximum gas diffusion leakage rate for this
seal has been found to be 100 ppm of argon dif-
fusing from the pump sump into the helium in the
bearing housing. The flow rate of both the helium
and the argon is 700 cfh. Satisfactory seal leakage
rates could not be obtained consistently with the
initial drip lubrication system; so the oil level in
the bearing housing was raised until the lower
edges of the running faces of the seal were im-
mersed. This provided a better oil film on the
seal mating faces, and satisfactory sealing condi-
tions were obtained.

A prototype model of the in-pile pump operated
satisfactorily, with the fuel mixture NaF- -ZrF -UF,
(53.5-40.6.5 mole %) as the pumped fluid, for
173 hr at 1400°F in an isothermal loop identical

to that of the in-pile Toop. Operation was then

An interruption in the plant air supply that was
being used to cool the fill-tank freeze line caused

“the fill-line temperature to rise to above the
melting point of the fuel and the indicated fill-
tank temperature to increase about 25°F due to
the absence of air movement in its vicinity. The

from ‘the fuel, could have increased the fill-tank

‘with the MTR in-pile loop assembly, because the

ditions of operation of these loops is given in
Table 2.1. The results of metallurgical examina-

‘tions of ‘these loops are presented in Sec. 5,

‘The major cause of failure of these fused-salt

 

loops has been the freezeup “of the salt in the

cooling coil when flow was interrupted for any

reason, Most flow interruptions result ‘from loss

of power, either at the test rig or in the building
as a whole. The freezing of the cooling coils has
occurred in times as short as 30 sec. Preliminary

tests have shown that a gas flame automatically

ignited at the time of an interruption of the cooling
air will prevent freezing for periods of 5 min or
more. Several methods of automatic ignition of
such a flame were tried, but the only one which
appears to give the surety of ignition required is a
high-resistance heater coil in the gas stream; the
coil is energized from a 12-v, wet-cell circuit.

Nine forced-circulation loops were operated with

A summary of the conditions of operation of these
loops is given in Table 2.2. The loops were
heated with electric heaters, and each loop had
an economizer section. The results of metal-
lurgical examination of these loops are presented
in Sec. 5, “Corrosion Research,”

A new test loop has been designed with which
it will be possible to obtain accurate information
on the oxygen content of sodium during operation.
The test system, as indicated in Fig. 2.1, consists
of a main loop, which includes the sodium-sampling
device and a bypass cold trap, and a plugging-
indicator loop, with its separate pump and flow-
meter. (The plug indicator is described in a sub-

sequent portion of this section.) The cooling rate
of the entire loop can be controlled to a fraction of

a degree per minute. The oxygen content of the
sodium circulating in the main loop is controlied
by use of the bypass cold trap. The plugging
indicator loop and the sampling device are both

used to independently determine the oxygen content
"and thus to determine the efficiency of the cold

trap.

In order to use the plugging-indicator loop, the
valve between that loop and the main loop is
opened, and sodium is allowed to flow from the
main loop until the plugging-indicator loop is
filled to a predetermined level in the surge tank.

It was noted that the Fulton Sylphon seal was not

The lower journal bearing of the pump was de-
signed initially to carry loads of up to 600 Ib, but
hydraulic studies revealed that the expected
bearing load would be 150 Ib or less. With the
lower loads it appears to be feasible to employ
Inconel as the journal material and to thus obviate
the need for a hardened journal bushing, Tests 1,
2, 3, and 8 were conducted in the bearing and seal
testing facility, and loads up to 300 Ib were satis-
factorily carried by the Inconel shaft in a bronze
bearing.

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

 Short-Circuit Pump-Test Stand
SM. DeCamp, J.

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

: J. B. Kercheval
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft

Fabrication and “assembly of the first short

circuit pump-test’ “stand, described previously,
have been essentially completed, and water tests
have been started, These water tests are for
checking mechanical fits and interferences, check-
‘ing pressure breakdown bypass flow rates, and
“correlating head and flow data from this loop with
those obtained on the water test stand. 3

Assembly ‘of the pump “and the volute indicated

~ that the radial seals with metallic O-rings were
Covery sensitive dimensionally. A 0.002.in, intet-
ference on a bein.~dia O-ring was not enough to
“seal, while a 0.008- to 0.010-in. interference
caused difficulty i in assembly and disassembly.

Data were taken on bypass flow rates to deter-
mine the effect of the left-hand threads used in
the flow breakdown annulus. With a radial clear-
ance of 10 mils and thread depth of 37 mils, a by-
pass flow rate of 2.3 gpm was measured at a pump
speed of 2700 rpm; the main circuit flow rate was
approximately 630 gpm. Increasing the radial
clearance to 15 mils gave the desired flow rate of
4.77 gpm.

The data obtained in the water tests will be use-
ful in analyzing the data obtained at high tempera-
tures, since it will be difficult to measure dis-
charge pressures when the system is operating at
high temperature, Throttling orifices for the loop
were calculated to give a 50-ft head at 650 gpm.
Data obtained in the water tests indicate a flow
rate of 650 gpm at a 46-ft head. The test loop is
now being readied for operation at the design tem-

perature, 1400°F.

blies will be made with NaK or sodiom and with

the fuel mixture NaF-ZrF -UF (50-46-4 mole %)
as the circulated fluids. Data obtained at 1200
and 1400°F on shaft speed, head, flow rate, and
power input will be compared with water-perform.
ance data, and cavitation and vibration characteris-
tics will be noted. An endurance test will then be
run at design head and flow rate. The xenon.
removal system, including the helium-bleed and
oil leak age-removal systems, is to be incorporated
in the circuit for checking in conjunction with the
main fluid circuit, One of the two test stands will
be available for acceptance testing of the final
MF-2 rotary assemblies with NaK.

‘A concentric pipe design was chosen for the
test stand loop to eliminate thermal stresses from
nonuniform heating or cooling, to reduce the num-
ber of critical welds, and to provide a compact
assembly. The compactness of the assembly makes
possible a low fuel inventory.

A conventional venturi is located 15 pipe diam-
eters (60 in.) downstream from the pump volute
discharge, and a piston-type throttle valve is
located downstream of the venturi. The valve
travel was specified within the recommended travel
of a suitable bellows used as the valve-stem seal.
This valve cannot be fully closed; therefore, as
presently conceived, the minimum loop resistance,
with the valve wide open, will permit testing at
about one-half the rated pump head with rated flow,
and the maximum loop resistance, with the valve
closed, will permit testing at approximately one-
half the rated flow with the pump delivering the
rated head.

A screen-type, axial-baffle, flow-control device
is provided just below the inlet to the impeller to
prevent an uneven velocity profile and prerotation
in the stream entering the pump. To simulate the
fluideexpansion and xenon-removal region, a sepa-
rate chamber is provided above the top plate of the
pump volute. Fluid enters and leaves this chamber
only through the pump barrel wall, and this cham.
ber is not directly connected to the pump inlet

‘chamber except through the impeller. The rise in

level of the fluid in this chamber for a 100°F in-
crease in the temperature of the fuel mixture will
be about the same as that for the ART.

During steady-state high-temperature operation,
the pumping power will be removed by blowing a
high-volume low-pressure air stream transversely

actoss the outer loop pipe. A power failure will

Intermediate Heat Exchanger Tests

The new experimental assembly (stand A) for
intermediate heat exchanger fests, described
previously,4 is shown in Fig. 2.4. This apparatus
was operated for 690 hr in a series of furnace and
diffusion cold trap tests of the NoK system and a
2-hr cleaning cycle of the fluoride-fuel circuit, A
chronological description of the tests that were
conducted and the troubles that were encountered

is given in Table 2.4,
As stated in Table 2.4, the 1-Mev gas-fired fur-

nace (Struthers Wells Corp.) for heating the NaK, as
installed, did not give satisfactory performance.
The best over-all thermal efficiency that could be
obtained was 28%, with 1.7 x 106 Btu/hr being
transferred to the NaK. In an effort to improve the
performance, a 12-ft-high stack extension was
placed on top of the original 4-ft-high stack. As a
result, a thermal efficiency of 31% was obtained,
with 2.83 x 10¢ Btu/hr being transferred to the
NaK. Since the heat transfer was still below the

design requirement, a new, larger burner was then
installed, which proved to be capable of trans.

tent in the NaK was measured by means of a plug
indicator and by chemical analyses of samples
taken from the pump bowl. The plug indicator is a
concentric pipe stem connected to the NaK circuit,
with a filter containing five 0.030-in.-dia holes
located at the bottom of the inner pipe, which plugs
with precipitated oxide at the saturationtempera-
ture of the oxide in the NaK. Both the plug indi-
cator and the chemical analyses showed that the
cold trap had reduced the initial oxide content of
1000 ppm to values of 150 and 650 ppm, respec-
tively, as found by the two methods after the first
56 hr of operation, This discrepancy in oxide
content, as obtained by the two methods, cannot be
explained at this time.

The second cold trap test was of 193-hr duration
(the period from 373 to 566 hr of operation) with
NaK flow rates of 50 to 110 gpm and NaK tempera-
tures ranging from 1000 to 1400°F; the tempera-
tures in the cold trap were below 750°F. In this
test, only the plug indicator was used to measure
the oxide content. These measurements showed
that the oxide content was reduced from an initial
1000 ppm to 150 ppm after the first 168 hr of NaK
circulation, This level of oxide content is con-
sidered to be too high for a NaK-Inconel system.

One tube bundle of the fuel-to-NaK intermediate
heat exchanger (No. 2), described previously?
developed a leak after approximately 350 hr of
operation of the NaK circuit. The fuel had been
circulated for only 2 hr in the fuel circuit during
this period. At the time that the leak occurred,
the fuel circuit was empty, except for small un-
drainable portions in the pressure transmitters, fuel

pump, and the lower ends of the heat exchanger
_ tube bundles, With a pressure differential of 35
_ psi across the NaK and fuel circuits, a consider-

_quantity of NaK flowed info the fuel circuit

made it susceptible to stress failure,

After the heat exchanger had been removed and
replaced with piping, operation “of the NaK system
was resumed. The NaK was circulated for 15 hr
at 1500°F and then drained while hot. Since the
NaK contained fuel contamination, it was replaced
with fresh NaK, and the second cold trap test de-
scribed above was made. However, the operation
had to be stopped again when one of the NaK-to-air
radiators, described previously, ® developed a leak.
During the last 55 hr of operation, a steady in-
crease in the NaK pressure drop across the radiators
was noted, The pressure drop increase coincided
with startup of the radiator blowers, which caused
a NaK temperature differential of 200°F across
the radiators. The increase in pressure drop,
along with a gradual decrease in NaK flow at a
constant pump speed, could only mean that some

f the radiator tubes were plugging. These plugged
tubes were cooled by the air flow from the blower,
with the result that there were low-temperature
regions in the otherwise high-temperature radiator

matrix, The high thermal stresses thus created
were probably of significance in the ultimate
failure of the one radiator unit, The radiator that
failed is shown in Fig, 2.7.

The fuel that leaked into the NaK circuit after
the heat exchanger failure was not flushed out
during the 15-hr period of circulation of the NaK
after the removal of the heat exchanger. The
analysis of the black material scraped from the
fins of the NaK-to-air radiator when it was being
examined after the leak occurred showed 34%
zirconium and 0.25% uranium; the remainder of the
material was sodium, potassium, iron, nickel,
chromium, and copper.

The NaK circuit was cleaned by the Materials
Chemistry Division. A total of 4.2 g of zirconium,
0.46 g of uranium, and 3939 g (8.6 Ib) of Inconel

‘was removed in the cleaning operation. Two 5%

nitric acid washes removed 87% of the uranium,
and one wash with 2% ammonium bifluoride and
2.5% nitric acid, a highly corrosive agent, removed
82% of the zirconium. Two ammonium bifluoride
and nitric acid washes removed 90% of the Inconel.

The equivalent diameter used in calculating the
Reynolds number was based on the total wetted
perimeter of the tubes plus the side-wall area.
The fuel-side pressure-drop data obtained are com-

pared in Fig. 2.9 with a theoretical pressure-drop

curve calculated from data obtained from water
tests carried out on similar tube bundles to deter
mine the pressure drop created by the spacers.
The calculated pressure drops are higher than
those that would be predicted by theory because
of the presence of spacers.

During the last 456 hr of operation of this test
the NaK inlet and outlet temperatures were main-
tained at approximately ART design conditions
to study mass-transfer effects. No appreciable
amount of mass transfer was detected by visual
inspection when the > loop was dismantled. During

this period of operation the efficiency of the NaK-
to-air radiator used as a heat dump dropped con-
tinuously for approximately 360 hr and then im-
proved suddenly. Samples token from the NaK
sump tank at the completion of the test indicated
a very high oxygen content in the NaK (approxi-
mately 2500 ppm). A circulating cold trap has
been designed and will be installed on future
test assemblies in an effort to remove oxides
from the NaK.

Assembly of two, new, small heat exchanger
test stands is approximately 25% complete. Each
of these stands has a 500-kw electric heat source
and will be used to test six 20-tube heat ex-
changers. Two heat exchangers are being fabri-
cated by ORNL and four have been ordered from
outside vendors.

A 25-tube heat exchanger is being designed,
with ART tube sizes and spacing, that will be
operated at ART design temperature and flow
conditions. [tis proposed to procure five of these
units from outside vendors. A block diagram of
the design operating conditions for this group
of heat exchanger tests is presented in Fig. 2.10.

Themmal-Cycling Test of Sodium-Inconel-

M. H. Cooper R. D. Pedk
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft

The third test to be operated in the sodium-
beryllium-Inconel compatibility testing apparatus,
described previously, was started on July 14,
1955. The test section consists of a beryllium
cylinder drilled centrally with a }-in.-dia hole
through which sodium can flow. The loop was
operated isothermally at 1100°F for 100 hr, with
a sodium flow of 3 gpm, and then shut down on
July 18, 1955, because of the failure of the 250-kw
transformer. The loop was restarted on August 27,
1955, with a projected operating period of 1000 hr
with 100 thermal cycles. One cycle represents
4 hr of operation at high power, during which the
sodium enters the test section at 1150°F and is
heated electrically to 1300°F, and 4 hr of operation
at low power, during which the sodium enters the
test section at slightly less than 1300°F and
leaves at 1300°F.

COLD TRAPS AND PLUG INDICATORS
F. A. Anderson
University of Mississippi
J. J. Milich
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft

A survey of the literature and of the available
experimental data was undertaken to obtain infor-

“tation on the use of cold traps as devices for

removing or controlling the presence of undesir
able impurities, especially oxygen, in sodium-
or NaK-+filled Inconel systems and on the use of
plugging indicators as devices for determining
the oxygen content of sodium or NaK streams.
In addition to information obtained from the litera-
ture, supplementary data were obtained during
visits to the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory,
Argonne National Laboratory, Mine Safety Appli-
ances Company, and North American Aviation,

Although both diffusion and circulating cold
traps have been shown to be capable of reducing
the oxide content of liquid sodium or NaK to values
corresponding to the saturation concentrations at
the cold trap temperatures, specific data are not
available which will permit sound engineering
design of cold traps. Diffusion or natural-convection
cold traps do their work much more slowly than cir-
culating or forced-circulation traps and, so far,
have been of primary interest only in relatively
small-volume systems (up to a few gallons capac-
ity). The existence of fairly strong eddy currents
in diffusion cold traps is suspected. If such
currents existed, their effects would overshadow
completely the effect of natural diffusion. It is
evident that experimental work would be required
to obtain a basis for the design of diffusion cold
traps.

Circulating cold traps have the important advan-
tage of lowering the oxide concentration of a sys-
tem rapidly. Present conventional designs that
provide for holdup times of 5 min and superficial
liquid velocities of the order of 3 fpm give system
cleanup times that correspond to three system
charge turnovers through the trap. Cold traps
having volumes ranging from about 3 to 10% of
the volume of the system have been utilized suc-
cessfully. Although microporous filters are con-
sidered to be unsatisfactory in cold traps, the
use of a packing material such as York demister
packing has been shown to raise cold trap effi-

ciencies from 68 to about 98%. Packing is used

to provide sufficient surface to hold the precipi-
tated oxide, but it is not intended to function as
a filter medium,

On the basis of the collected data and arbitrary
specifications, three circulating cold traps have
been designed, one for a relatively large, 80-gal
system and two for a relatively small, 4000-ml
(~1-gal) system, Figs. 2.13, 2.14, and 2.15. These
designs are not necessarily optimum; that is, it
is felt that they will lower the oxygen content
of the system, but they may be larger than neces-
sary and may have more cooling or heating capacity
than that required. The traps are expected to
operate at 400°F and to reduce the oxygen con-
tent of the main liquid metal system to the cor-
responding saturation value of 50 ppm. During
operation, precautions must be observed to prevent
the saturation temperature of the liquid metal
with respect to oxide (Na,0) content being reached
at any point in the system other than in the cold
trap. If the saturation temperature were reached
outside the cold trap, precipitation of oxide would
occur at that point and plugging of a pipe or some
other system component would occur.

Because of the difficulty of making reliable de-
terminations of the oxide content of molten sodium
or NaK by chemical procedures, considerable use
has been made of the plugging indicator as a
simple device for determining the oxide content
indirectly. Although there is some disagreement

as to the exact significance of the results, in-
vestigators at KAPL feel that the use of a plugging
indicator is a reliable and accurate method for
determining oxide contents to within 0.001%.
Unfortunately, as in the case of cold traps, the
design of plugging indicators is, at the present
time, more of an art than a science. Because the
design first used at KAPL proved to be satisfac-
tory, and because of lack of time, no effort has
been made to determine whether a better design
could be developed.

A plugging indicator consists of a perforated
plate {containing 15 to 21 holes 50 mils in diam-
eter) placed in a l-in. line through which molten
metal flows at the rate of 1 gpm (~10 fps through
the indicator plate holes). The flowing stream
is cooled until the oxide saturation point is reached,
at which time precipitation occurs. When the pre-
cipitated oxide partially plugs the perforated
plate, a change in the flow rate occurs. The
temperature at the plate corresponding to the
change in flow rate, measured with an electro-
magnetic flowmeter, is taken to be the plugging
temperature, Although this temperature can be
used as a relative indication of the purity of the
liquid metal stream, it is common practice to
translate the plugging temperature into an oxide
concentration by means of a solubility curve,
A recommended design for a plugging indicator
and a bypass loop is shown in Fig. 2.16.

A critical assembly of the reflector-moderated
circulating-fuel reactor loaded with sufficient

 

Cys to give about 3% excess reactivity was de-
I scribed’ previously.
: “series of experiments in which the excess reac-
“tivity was utilized to measure certain reactivity

After the completion of a

coefficients and the effects of various structure
changes, the assembly was reloaded in order to
determine the clean critical concentration more
exactly. With the same structure and dimensions
as those reported previously, the U235 concen-
tration was reduced from 0.416 to 0.345 g per cubic
centimeter of fuel region, equivalent to a loading
of 20.07 kg of U233, and the assembly (CA-21.2)
was critical with only 0.14% excess reactivity.
This assembly is compared in Table 3.1 with the
assembly (CA-21-1) which had 3% excess reac-
tivity.

Two structural changes in the assembly have
also been investigated. In one modification (as-
sembly CA-22) the average width of one of the
end ducts, the portion of the assembly that simu-
lates the fuel flow channels into the reactor core,
was increased from 1.29 to 2.80 in. to make its
volume almost 2.5 times that of the originally
constructed end duct. This change was made
because consideration is being given in the re-
actor design to the possibility of using end ducts
of larger cross section. The increased fuel capac-
ity of the assembly necessitated the addition of
U235 in the end ducts, which made a total of
28.35 kg of U235 at an average density of 0.405 g

: of ys per cubic centimeter of fuel material.

The. array was critical with 3. 2% o excess s reactivity,

and the estimated ‘‘clean”

In another experiment (CA-23), with end ducts of
the original size, the average radius of the central
psuedo-spherical beryllium region or ‘‘island’”’ was
increased from 5.18 to 7.19 in., with a correspond-
ing reduction in the fuel volume of from 58.2 to
44.3 liters. The use of a thinner fuel annulus is
being considered in the reactor design as a means
of reducing fuel self-shielding. The beryllium
content of the core was increased from 67 to 92 kg,
including that in the end ducts. This assembly
was critical with a loading of 18.62 kg of U233
at an average density of 0.420 g of U235 per cubic
centimeter of fuel region. The excess reactivity
was 0.19%, and the estimated critical mass, with-

critical mass was

out control rods, was 18.4 kg of U235, The di-

mensions of assemblies CA-22 and CA-23 are given
in Table 3.1, clong with the data obtained with
these assemblies.

CRITICAL EXPERIMENTS

A low-nuclear-power, high-temperature, reflector-
moderated-reactor critical experiment is currently
under way, and some preliminary results have been
obtained. The liquid fuel in the assembly is at
1200°F. The reactor section of the equipment
closely resembles the current design of the ART.
It consists, essentially, of an annular fuel region
separated from the beryllium island and reflector
by Y-in.-thick Inconel core shells. The island,
partly surrounded by the inner Inconel shell, is
shown in Fig. 3.1. The outer shell, with some
of the beryllium reflector in place, is shown in
Fig. 3.2. A re-entrant tube is mounted along the

vertical axis of the reactor to serve as a guide

for the annular control-safety rod, which contains
a mixture of the oxides of the rare-earth elements.
The rod is magnetically supported and can be
positioned above the horizontal mid-plane for con-
trol. It is free to fall below the mid-plane for

 

reactor shutdown. The outside diameter of the
neutron-absorber section of the rod is 1.28 in.,
and the annulus is % in. wide. The density of
the neutron-absorber compact is 6.5 g/ecm3; its
principal constituents are Sm,0, (63.8 wt %) and
Gd, 0; (26.3 wt %). The support and the driving
rod for the neutron source are coaxial with the
control rod. The beryllium blocks in the reflector
and the island are in an atmosphere of helium;
there is no sodium in the system.

The reactor is mounted above a reservoir for
the liquid fuel, which is a mixture of the fluorides
of sodium, zirconium, and enriched (93% U235)
uranium, The fuel is transferred to the reactor
by applying helium under pressure to the liquid
surface in the reservoir; the return fo the reservoir
is by gravity. The temperature of the system has
been raised to 1350°F by electrical heaters located
external to the reflector and the fuel reservoir.
The completed assembly is shown in Fig. 3.3.

After an initial test of system operation and
leak tightness with an equimolar mixture of NaF
and ZrF,, successive increments of Na, UF, were
added until the reactor became critical. The fuel
concentration was then 6.30 wt % (2.87 mole %)
uranium, and the excess reactivity, determined
from the subsequent calibration of the control rod,
was about 0.13% Ak/k. A measurement of the
over-all temperature coefficient of reactivity be-
tween 1150 and 1350°F showed the value to be
negative and equal to 2 x 10=° (A%/k)/°F. An
increase in the uranium concentration of the fuel
from 6.30 to 6.88 wt % resulted in an increase in
reactivity of 1.3% Ak/k. The control rod has a
value of 1.7% Ak/E when inserted to a point 4 in.

Phase equilibrium studies were made of the
LiF-ZrF,, UF,-ZrF,, NaF-LiF-ZrF,, NaF-LiF-
UF,, NaF-RbF-ZrF ,-UF,, KF-ZrF,, and NaF-KF-
ZrF, systems and of the BeF,-containing systems
NaFLiF- BeF,, NaF-LiF-BeF,-UF,, NaF.BeF,-
UF, KF- Bef, and NaF-KF-BeF,. A revised
equilibrium diagram for the LiF-ZrF, system is
presented. Additional data were obtained on the
solubility of UF, in BeF,-bearing compositions.

Additional work was done in investigating the
equilibrium reduction of FeF, by hydrogen in
NaZrF, the reduction of UF, by structural metals,
and the stability of chromium and iron fluorides in
molten fluorides. The experimental preparation of
NH, SnF; and of compounds of ZrF, with CrF,,
NiF,, and FeF, is described. The investigations
of the reaction of UF, with uranium in alkali fluo-
rides and the reaction of uranium metal with alkali
fluorides were continued. Studies of the reactions
between molten fluorides and metals included some
exploratory work on the equilibrium between so-
dium-potassium alloy and NaF-KF melts at 800°C,

Fuel purification and production research in-
cluded the investigation of methods for the re-
covery of contaminated fuel for re-use and the
conversion of ZrO, to ZrF, in the present produc-
tion equipment, The studies of processing tech-
niques for the purification of BeF,-bearing com-
positions were continued. Efforts to resolve the
problems in the procurement of adequate supplies

of ZrF, are described, as well as improvements in
_ batching and dispensing operations and loading
“and draining operations,

established the primary phase as Li, ZrF ;, and the
liquidus temperature was found to be about 590°C.
Recently obtained thermal analysis data showed
that the Li, Z¢F -Li;ZrF eutectic melts at about
580°C. Since Li, ZF is the primary phase of the
mixture containing 31° mole % ZrF ,, the Li, ZrF
eutectic must contain less than 31 mole % of ZF,
No Li ZtF, was found in quenched samples con.
taining 33.3 mole % ZrF , over the range 530 to
619°C, and thus it was confirmed that Li 2 LF
melts’ congruently. The melting point of Li, ZrF
was found, by thermal analysis, to be about 87°C
~ Thermal and differential thermal analysis data
“indicated that a eutectic is formed by the mixture
with about 50 mole % ZrF,. The primary phase of
the mixture with 48 mole. % ZF, was found, by
quenching, to be Li, ZrF; the liquidus temperature
“was 522°C, and the solidus temperature was

508°C. The existence of Li, ZrF and LiyZr,F

66

in these samples was confirmed by x-ray diffrac-
tion examination, The Li, ZrF  -Li Zr Fo eutec-
tic appears to contain about 48 mole % ZrF, and
to melt at 508°C,

The experiments reported previously! seemed to
narrow down the composition of the unknown phase
in the mixture with more than 50 mole % ZrF
either Li,ZryF,, (60 mole % ZrF,) or LiZr,F 4
(57.1 mole % zit). Other experiments confirmed
this conclusion, but no decision between the two
formulas could be reached on the basis of the
quenching experiments. However, analogy to the
NoF-ZrF, system indicated LiyZr,F,, to be the
more probable, and it has been established inother
experiments (described below) that Na Zr Fo and
Liz Zr Fo belong to the same crystal system and
form a complete solid-solution series.

Another phase (cubic) has sometimes appeared
in quenched samples in the region above 50 mole %

ZrF, at temperatures at which liquid would be
expected to be present. A differential thermal
analysis break at 580°C was thought at first
to be associated with this phase. However,
quench growth and well-crystallized ZeF , were
found in quenched samples containing 57.1, 60,
62.5, 66.7, and 75 mole % ZrF, above 520°C,
the incongruent melting point of LiyZr, Fig. There
appeared to be no difference in the samples taken
above and below 580°C, It has been decided that
the cubic material is either a metastable or a low-
temperature phase which sometimes precipitates
during quenching. The break at 580°C was prob-
ably due to nonequilibrium conditions.

The liquidus temperature of the mixture with
66.7 mole % ZtF , was found by quenching to be
near 695°C. Thermal analysis data for the mix-
ture with 57.5 mole % ZrF, gave a liquidus tem-
perature of 618°C,

There is evidence that Li Zr F,, decomposes
slowly into Li 2 ZrF and ZF, upon cooling. A
relatively pure sample of Li Zr,F,,, prepared by
heating for 48 hr at 500°C, was teheated to 446°C
for several hours and quenched. The sample then
gave a good x-ray pattern for Li,ZrF, and ZrF ,
although some Li 3Zr Foo remained. “The decom
position temperature has not been definitely estab-

tures of 3LiF+-4ZrF , and 3NaF.4ZrF,. A continu-
ous gradation of optical properties from 3NaF.4ZrF ,

tion of a complete solid-solution series, The
primary phase along the join was ZrF,, and the
liquidus temperatures increased steadily from

550°C for 3NaF.4ZrF, to 618°C for 3LiF-4ZrF ,

The solidus temperatures, which corresponded o

the incongruent melting temperatures of the solid-
solution series, exhibited a minimum at 475°C for
the mixture with about 25 mole % LiF. The

6NaF-7ZtF ,, 2LiF.ZrF,, and the 3(Na,Li)F.4ZF ,

An intensive study of the NaF-LiF-ZrF UF,
quaternary system was interrupted when it was
learned that no improvement in viscosity resulted
when the mixtures contained relatively high LiF
and low ZrF, contents. At high zirconium con-
centrations, there was a marked reduction in melt-
ing point which was, however, accompanied by
unusually high ZrF ; vapor pressures.

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

The join between 6NaF.7UF, and 6LiF- 7UE,
appears to form a side of a compatibility triangle,
and so does the join between 6NaF.7UF, and

~ 3LiF. UF,. These two joins, along with the ‘asi

Hc (28 mole % UF 4)» the temperature may

havior seems to be due to an exothermic decom-
position of 3LiF.UF, at about the eutectic tem-
petature, along with a tendency for the melt to
undercool and then rapidly decompose.

 

The System NaF-RbF-ZrF ,.U F,
H. A. Friedman R. E. Thoma

Materials Chemistry Division

Preliminary studies of some systems containing
RbF and ZrF, were made in an attempt to obtain
materials with low viscosities for possible use as
reactor fuels. Previous studies? of the RbF-ZrF,
binary system had shown low melting points only

for mixtures with moderately high (greater than
40 mole %) ZF, concentrations; 3RbF. ZrF , melts
at 900°C. Consequently, low-melting mixtures

containing RbF and UF, with 20 to 40 mole %

ZF, necessarily contain a fourth component.

The RbF available, at present, contains about
20 mole % of KF, and therefore all studies re-
“ported here were made with RbF containing that
“amount of KF. It was anticipated that the KF

would substitute isomorphically for RbF and that
. the phase diagrams would not appear to involve
the KF component. Unfortunately, this proved not

"to be the case. For example, 3RbF.ZIF, formed

preferentially, and, if additional KF were present,
an excess of KF remained. In low-melting parts of
the NaF«(Rb,K)F-ZrF , system, unexpected phases
made their appearance, and therefore quasi binaries
could not be established. A join at 47 mole %
ZrF , appeared to pass through the phase fields of
two * ternary compounds and to give the lowest
melting points at the high RbF-content end. This
behavior, coupled with lack of information regard-
ing the similar NaF-KF-ZrF , system, caused the
postponement of a systematic study of the NaF-
RbF-ZrF, diagram, pending results from viscosity
measurements on an RbF-ZrF .UF, fuel mixture
and the procurement of better RbF,

In an effort to find a suitable fuel mixture for
viscosity measurements, a constant 4 mole % of
UF, was added to the RbF-ZrF, binary over a
range of compositions from 55 to 5 mole % RbF,
All these mixtures appeared to melt between 410
and 420°C and to give no detectable heat effects
above this range. This result led to the suspicion,
later confirmed, that small amounts of precipitates
with a very low temperature coefficient of solu
bility were escaping detection, From the middle
of this range of apparently low-melting mixtures,
the composition RbF-ZrF ,-UF, (48-48-4 mole %)
was chosen as a preparation for viscosity meas-
urements. The purified mixture was cooled to
450°C to precipitate any solidified crystals before
transfer; however, the transfer was carried out
through heated lines and a heated filter, so the
flowing melt was heated to 575°C. Crystals of
(Zr,U)F, solid solution were found in the heel re-
maining in the purification vessel but not in the
filtered product. Hence, (Zr,U)F , was presumed
to be the primary phase; it is possible that the
(Zr,U)F , precipitated incompletely in the 15min
equilibration period at 450°C, since small parti-
cles were subsequently observed in the melted
product at temperatures above 500°C, However,
petrographic examination of the solidified melts
in which particles had been observed while they
were molten showed the presence of significant
amounts of oxyfluoride,

Viscosity measurements below 600°C were not
satisfactory because of these particles, but the
values obtained above 600°C were comparable with
those obtained, to date, for satisfactory fuel mix-
tures (see Sec. 7, ‘*Heat Transfer and Physical
Properties’). All the work described here was

The System KF-ZrF

Consultant

The system KF-ZrF , is being studied in an at-
tempt to obtain background information regarding
the rather similar RbF-ZrF , system and to check
and refine techniques for handling these hygro-
scopic materials. Cooling curves obtained for ten
stirred KF-ZrF, melts with compositions in the
range 33.3 to 59 mole % ZrF, were in general
agreement with the phase diagram previously pub-
lished.’ Thermal breaks in the range 45 to 50
mole % ZrF indicate that there are two forms of
KZrF, one of which is metastable.

The System NaF-KF-ZrF,
H. A. Friedman R. E. Thoma

Materials Chemistry Division

Preliminary studies indicate that the NaF-KF-
ZrF , system is much more complex than either the
NaF-ZiF -UF, system or the NaF-LiF-UF, sys-
tem. Neither of these latter systems shows ter-
nary compounds; in contrast, the NaF-KF-ZrF,
system shows at least five such compounds. One
compound has the composition NaF-KF.ZtF,, and
another has the composition 3NaF.3KF.2ZrF ,.
Although the latter compound forms a compatibility
triangle with NaF and K,ZrF,, it cannot form a
"quasi binary with K3ZrF,, NagZrF, or NaF, be-
cause it apparently melts incongruently at about
755°C to KyZrF, and liquid. Cooling curves on
the Na, ZrF_-K,ZrF, join show a minimum in the
liquidus temperatures at about 800°C for the coma
position with about 15 mole % KF; the liquidus
temperatures then rise gradually to about 918°C
for the compound K 3 ZrF, and about 850°C for the
‘compound Na JZeF Since a slowly cooled melt of
a composition midway between 3NaF3KF. 2ZrF,
“and NaF. KF. -ZrF, consists of only these chases,
it can be concluded that this join is a common
base of two, as yet undetermined, compatibility
triangles.

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1955

Eight melts were made along the 33.3 mole %
ZrF, join of compositions containing from 15 to
50 mole % KF and NaF as the remainder, Although
all these compositions contained the compound
NaFKF.ZrF, as one of the phases in the com-
pletely crystallized preparation, liquidus-tempera=
ture relations indicate that the compound melts
incongruently and that therefore there is no quasi
binary along this join,

Melting relations and phase compositions of six
preparations along the 47 mole % ZrF , join indi-
cate that the mixture with 47 mold % ZrF , also is
not a quasi binary, because most of the composi-
tions consist of three solid phases, including a
new ternary compound of undetermined composition
that is probably near NaF 2KF.3ZrF,. The mini-
mum liquidus temperature along this join is about
420°C for a mixture with about 35 mole % KF, A
search in this general area has indicated that
there is a eutectic, with the approximate composi-
tion 38 mole % KF, 21 mole % NaF, 41 mole %
ZrF ,, which melts at about 400°C,

The System NaF-LiF-BeF,

Thermal analysis data were obtained with a num-
ber of compositions within a wedge-shaped area in
the temary diagram having the LiF-Na,BeF, eu-

" tectic (16 mole % LiF) at the apex and Na, BoF,

and NaF-BeF, (70-30 mole %) at the other comers,
The availabla data indicate that acceptably low
melting points can be obtained with low LiF con-
centration by moving into the ternary system along
the drainage path leading from the NaF-Na,BeF,
eutectic (approximately 31 mole % BeF,; melting
point, 570°C) toward the LiF-Na,BeF, eutectic.
Further, viscosity data for BeF -bearing mixtures
indicate that, in order to obtain a melt with a
kinematic viscosity as low as that of the ARE-type
fuel (2.82 centistokes at 600°C and 1.34 centi-
stokes at 800°C),% the BeF, content of the melt

must not be greater than 30 mole %, to assure com-
plexing of BeF, as BeF,~~ ions in the melt. If
an NaF-LiF-BeF, mixture is desired, it also ap-
pears that the LiF content will probably have to
‘be less than 10 mole %. One composition that
‘meets these requirements is the mixture NaF-LiF-
BeF, (63.5-7.5-29 mole %), which has a melting
point of about 525°C, It is expected that the
viscosity of this mixture will be determined in the
near future,

The low-melting temary mixture NaF-LiF- BeF,
(27-35-38 mole %), reported previously’ on the
basis of cooling-curve data to melt at 325 + 10°C,
was found to melt at 339 + 5°C by the use of dif
ferential thermal analysis techniques, The former
value was low because of undercooling, This mix-
ture has been reported? to have kinematic viscosi-
ties that are too high — 3.85 centistokes at 600°C
and 1.47 centistokes at 800°C — to be considered
competitive with those of the ARE fuel but low
enough to be of interest for a reactor design re-
quiring a substantially lower melting point fuel
than can be obtained with known ZrF ,.base com-
positions.

Liquidus temperatures were determined for sev-
eral compositions by differential thermal analysis
of samples cooled rapidly from 675°C to room tem-

perature in order to avoid the segregation of the

crystalline components that apparently occurs on
slow cooling. The composition NaF-LiF-BeF,

(50-16%-33Y% mole %) showed a liquidus fempera-
ture of 4785C and a solidus temperature, deter-
‘mined from heating curves, of 329°C. The mixture
NaF-Li F-BeF, (64-5-31 mole %) showed a melting
point of 545°C and a freezing point of 555°C. An
unpurified melt of this composition froze at 535°C.

Most mixtures in this system have exhibited much
lower freezing points than melting points because
of the prevalence of undercooling, but the 64-5-31
mole % mixture appears to be exceptional in this
respect,

~The equimolar composition NaF-LiF-BeF,, pre-
‘viously investigated by Jahn, was studied by
“using quenching and differential thermal analysis
techniques. The latter technique gave a value of
“434°C for the liquidus temperature, as compared

with the approximate value of 460°C reported by
Jahn. A crystalline phase having the x-ray pattern
described by Jahn for the NaL.iBeF, compound pre-
pared from aqueous solution was observed in
samples of this composition quenched at tempera-
tures ranging from 406 to 562°C. At the lower
temperature, LiF and Na,LiBe,F, were also pres-
ent, while in samples quenched at temperatures
above the liquidus temperature, quench growth was
observed petrographically, Jahn's failure to ob-
tain NaLiBeF, from melted samples by quenching
at temperatures below 550°C, which he ascribed to
formation of Be,F,3- ions in the liquid, was more
likely due to poor quenching technique. Solid-
phase decomposition of NaL.iBeF, to give LiF and
; at 225°C, as reported by Jahn, was
Coon by the quenching experiments.

The System NaF-LiF-BeF ,-UF,

Investigations of the NaF-LiF-BeF,-U F, system
were confined to liquidus temperature determina-
tions with mixtures containing 2.5 mole % UF,,
which gives approximately the same concentration
of UF, (in g/em3) at 800°C as that of NaF-ZrF ,-

, (50-464 mole %). Various techniques, ine
din, thermal analysis, differential thermal anal-
ysis, filtration, and visual observation, were used.
The results are summarized in Table 4.1.

The first mixture listed in Table 4.1 was pre-
viously reported to have a liquidus temperature of
465 + 5°C, as determined by visual observation,

. The filtration experiment demonstrated that the
small, hightemperature thermal effects observed

on cooling curves were spurious.

Analyses of the filtrates obtained with the 64-5-
31 mole % mixture showed an increasing concentra-
tion of uranium from 540 to 520°C, which indicated
that a nonuranium phase was precipitating in this
temperature range. The filtration of the 27-35-38
mole % mixture showed that 9.65 wt % uranium,
equivalent to about 1.8 mole % UF 4 Was in solu-

tion at 335°C,

The System NaF -BeF UF,

The reported low viscosity of the NaF-BeF,
(70-30 mole %) composition'® prompted interest in
determining liquidus temperatures of mixtures

formed by adding 2.5 mole % UF, to NaF-BeF,

a probable liquidus temperature of 579 + 5°C.

BeF,-UF, (66.8-30. 7-25 ‘mole %) showed the

liquidus temperature to be below 562°C. The
highest thermal effect observed on cooling curves
with the latter composition was at about 555°C.
There appears to be little hope of obtaining an
acceptable liquidus temperature with a ternary
mixture of this type containing 2.5 ‘mole % UF,
and 30 mole % or less, BeF,.

The System K F-BeF,

Thermal analysis ‘data’ recently obtained “with

purified mixtures in the KF-BeF, system showed
slightly higher melting p nts than those obtained
by C. J. Barton and co-workers in investigations of

 

unpurified melts

 

  

 

 

Thermal analysis data on about 40 unpurified
melts in the NaF-KF-BeF, system were obtained
previously. !! The incomplete investigation showed

 

rather high liquidus temperatures, as compared
with those of the NaF-LiF-BeF, system, and no
promising fuel carrier compositions were formuy-
lated as a result of these studies, Recent interest
in obtaining a BeF, base fuel carrier with low
kinematic viscosity prompted a reinvestigation of
the NaF-KF-BeF, system. Thermal analysis data
obtained with temary compositions prepared from
purified binary mixtures have served to confirm the
earlier indications of high liquidus temperatures in
this system, particularly for the mixtures con-
taining 33 mole %, or less, BeF,. The mixtures
containing 33 mole %, or less, BeF, are considered
to be the most promising mixtures from the vis-
cosity standpoint, Preliminary results of petro-
graphic and x-ray diffraction examinations of a

‘number of slowly cooled melts show that composi-

tions on the NaF-K,BeF, join contain only these

two components, Themal analysis data for this

system, shown in Fig. 4.2, indicate that it is a

_simple eutectic system,” with the eutectic. con-

Solubility of UF, in BeF,-Bearing Compositions

Data on the solubility of UF, in a number of
BeF ,-bearing compositions were reported earlier. 1?
The Zomposition (in mole %) designated 69 NaF-31
BeF, in the previous work was actually 69 LiF-31
BeFs, All the earlier data were obtained with
nickel filters.13 In view of the greater stability of
UF, dissolved in LiF-NaF in copper containers
(discussed below in this section under the heading
“Reaction of UF, with Uranium in Alkali Flyo-
rides’’), it seemed desirable to see whether more
consistent data could be obtained in copper ap-
paratus equipped with a bronze filter medium. The
data obtained are shown in Table 4.2, together
‘with some additional data obtained with LiF-BeF,
mixtures in nickel apparatus. The uranium addi-
tions were made with UF, and uranium metal or by
adding large excesses of uranium metal to UF ,-
bearing melts,

It is difficult to draw definite conclusions from
such scattered data, but it is apparent that alloying
of uranium with the nickel filters and containers

was not the sole cause of the poor reproducibility
of the UF solubility data obtained in nickel ap-
paratus, the large amount of tetravalent uranium
found in all the filtrates, regardless of valence
form of the uranium added to the solvent, could be
due to oxidizing impurities in the melt, dispropor-
tionation of UF, or a reaction between UF, and
the alkali fluoride or beryllium fluoride in the melt,
Further experimentation will be required to deter-
mine the controlling factor in the production of
UF, in BeF,-bearing compositions.

drogen-fired chromium was reacted with 11.4 wt %
UF, (2.5 mole %) dissolved in approximately 30 g
of the NaF-LiF-ZrF , mixture contained in nickel.

The averages for the chromium values given in
Table 4.3 — 570 and 750 ppm at 600 and 800°C,
respectively — are the lowest found for any of the
reaction media studied, For comparison, chromium
values at 600 and 800°C in NaF ZrF , were 2250
and 2550 ppm; in NaF-ZrF (53-47 mole %), 1750
and 2150 ppm; in NoF-LiF- KF (11.5-46.5-42 mole
%), 1100 and 2700 ppm. Although the UF, con-
centration was somewhat lower (2.5 compared with
4,0 mole %) in the recent experiments than in the
previous experiments, this variable can account for
only a small part of the difference found in chro-
mium content. It seems more probable that the
most important factor, for the ZrF -containing
mixtures, is that with a decrease in ZrF, con-
centration there is also a decrease in the activity
of the UF, because of increased complexing by
the alkali fluorides. The results cannot be com-
pared with those obtained in the NaF-LiF-KF
eutectic, because virtually all the chromium is
present as the trivalent form in the eutectic. As
reported below, a large fraction of the chromium is
divalent in the NaF-LiF-ZrF ; mixture.

Data for the reaction of UF, with Fe® in nickel
containers at 600 and 800°C with NaF-LiF-Z:F
(22-55-23 mole %) as the reaction medium are given
in Table 4.4. In all these runs, 2 g of hydrogen-
fired iron wire and approximately 30 g of the
solvent containing 11.4 wt % (2.5 mole %) UF,
were employed.

The equilibrium iron values reported in Table 4.4
fall in the some general range as those found in
the other reaction media, The one difference to be
noted is that the iron values given in Table 4.4 are
slightly higher at 800 than at 600°C, whereas in
the NaF-ZrF , mixtures and the NaF-LiF-KF eutec-
tic slightly Cagher values were observed at 600
than at 800°C

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

From the results given in Tables 4.8 and 4.9, it
is seen that roughly 80% of the FeF, added re-

mains as Fe2* swith the remainder apparently being
oxidized to Fed* , although no logical mechanism
for the oxidation can be postulated. From the re-
sults for the runs in which FeF; was added, it is
evident, from the increase in the nickel content of
the system, that the nickel container reduces Fe3*
to Fe2*, No satisfactory balance between Fe2?
“and Ni2* is shown by these data; it is therefore
possible that the reaction is not the simple one
proposed. Some rather extensive experimental
work would be required to obtain an insight into
the possible equilibria involved.

Preparation of NH, SnF,.

 

In order to produce

‘about 500 g of NH (SF, essentially free of chlo-

"ride ion, stannous hydroxide was precipitated by

the addition of aqueous ammonia fo a hot aqueous
solution of SnCl, in the presence of Sn The
precipitate was washed by decantation, and the
raffinate was removed by centrifugation. After
dissolution of the precipitate in aqueous HF, the
precipitation, washing, ond centrifugation were
repeated. The precipitate was then treated with
the stoichiometric quantity of NH, HF, and was
dissolved in the minimum quantity of aqueous HF,
Crystals of NH, SnF, were recovered by partial
evaporation of this solution,

Compounds of ZrF, with CrF,, NiF,, and FeF,.
Evidence from various experiments has indicated
that the simple fluorides of chromium, iron, or
nickel are not the primary phase when solutions of
these materials in NaF-ZrF , mixtures are cooled;
also, petrographic and x-ray examinations of such
cooled melts show the solid phases recovered to
be quite similar, It was believed that primary
phases were complex compounds of ZrF , with the
structural metal fluorides. Accordingly, ZF, was
heated at 950°C in sealed nickel capsules with
each of the compounds CtF,, CrF,, FeF,, and
NiF, in 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2 stoichiometric propor-

“ratio was reversed, ZrF, and the compound ap-

peared. The compound seemed to be NiF,.ZrF ,
and the constancy of cell size with composition
of the mixture indicated very limited or no solid
solution of either NiF, or ZrF, in the compound.

The ZrF ,-FeF, fusions showed a compound that
was isomorphous withNiF ,+ZrF, but had a slightly
larger cell size. The compound FeF,.ZrF,, how-
ever, unlike its NiF,.ZrF, counterpart, forms
solid solutions with ZrF ,; the cell size of the
compound appeared to be lowered by the ZrF,,
When the FeF, was in excess (2 moles of FeF,
to 1 of ZrF,), an additional phase, as yet unidenti«
fied, was observed; the unchanged cell size of the
FeF, ZF, present indicated virtually no solid
solution of these compounds.

Petrographic examination indicated that the com
pound CrF,-ZrF, existed and that it was ap-
parently isomorphous with its FeF, and NiF,
counterparts, No x-ray diffraction data and no
observations of solid solution formation are yet
available. Because of the value of these studies
to the interpretation of some electrochemical
studies (also reported in this section), these
studies will be extended to include systems con-
taining NaF, as well as ZF,

Reaction of UF, with Uranium in Alkali Fluorides

C. J. Barton B. H. Clampitt
Materials Chemistry Division

It was previously reported?! that the reduction
of UF, in the NaF-LiF (40-60 mole %) eutectic
with metallic uranium was more nearly complete in
copper than in nickel apparatus, In those experi-
ments the copper apparatus was equipped with a
filter medium of bronze (82% Cu, 16% Sn, 2% Zn).
The experiments were recently repeated, with a
filter medium of pure copper being used; the data
from these experiments are presented in Table
4.10. The higher UF,/UF, ratios obtained in
these experiments suggest that some dispropor-
tionation of UF, occurred on contact of the melt
with the bronze filters,

However, when the reduction of UF, with ex
cess U® was carried out with the NaF-KF-LiF
eutectic (11,5-42-46.5 mole %) as the solvent, the
reaction yielded U3*/total U ratios of 0,55 to 0.7
regardless of whether copper or nickel containers

a similar reaction occurs at 750°C when the
NaF-LiF eutectic is used. In the recent experi-
ments the purified salt mixture and metallic ure
nium were placed in a nickel opparatus, and, after
formation and decomposition of UH; to subdivide
the uranium metal, the temperature was raised
to the desired value. The contents of the appa
ratus were agitated by sparging with helium. An
air-cooled condenser maintained at slightly above
room temperature was included in the exit gas
line to condense any alkali metal or alkali fluoride
swept out by the flowing helium. The trapped
material was dissolved in water and analyzed
chemically for potassium, sodium, lithium, fluorine,
and total alkalinity.

The results obtained with the NaF-KF-LiF eu-
tectic and with the NaF-LiF eutectic are presented
in Table 4.11. It is obvious from the data that
most of the trapped material was alkali metal;
less than 5% of the condensate was alkali fluoride.
Also, both the quantity of alkali metal evolved
and the uranium content of the melt increased
with time in a quite regular manner. As was ex-
pected, the reaction produced more K° than Na®
(when both were constituents of the melt) and
more Na® than Li However, the amount of alkali
metal collected did not, by a large factor, cor-
respond to the amount of uranium oxidized. It
appebrs certain that some condensation of the
alkali metals occurred in cooler portions of the
apparatus before the condenser was reached. The
apparatus is being remodeled to eliminate this
possibility and to demonstrate the stoichiometry
of the process.

and NaF-KF melts at 800°C. Samples of purified
potassium metal and NaF were loaded into a
hydrogen-fired nickel capsule in a helium atmos-
phere. After a welded capsule had been held at
800°C for several hours, it was quenched and
then opened under an atmosphere of helium. Sam-
ples of the metal phase were easy to obtain in
that they could be poured without difficulty into
a test tube having a rubber stopper and a stopcock.
A good sample of the salt phase was much more
difficult to obtain, because droplets of metal
clung tenaciously to it.

A more certain separation of the phases was

obtained by evacuating sealed test tubes that

had been filled in a helium atmosphere with sam-
ples of each phase and allowing the evacuated
tubes to partially fill with anhydrous isopropyl
alcohol. The alcohol reacted with the metal but
not with the salt. Since the salts were insoluble

in the isopropyl alcohol, the alcohol fraction was
© + filtered and analyzed to give an approximation
“i :of the Na¥KP® ratio, and the residue was dissolved

80

in water to give a water fraction that was analyzed
for the NaF/KF ratio. Results for the one experi-
ment which was carried to completion are pre-
sented in Table 4.12,

On the assumption that quenching effectively
froze the 800°C equilibrium and that no significant
exchange occurred during the short exposure of the
salt to isopropyl alcohol, the results in Table

Removal of CrF, from NaF-ZrF ,-UF Mixtures
F. L. Daley

Materials Chemistry Division

The standard hydrofluorination-hydrogenation
method for the purification of fluoride mixtures
will remove NiF, and FeF, by reduction of these
materials to the metals, but it is largely ineffec-
tive in removing CrF,. Accordingly, if the ma-
terials charged to the processing plant contain
appreciable concentrations of CrF,, an additional
processing step must be included. Since the raw
materials NaF, ZrF ,, and UF, contain only traces
of CrF,, this contamination is not a problem in
the production of virgin fuel. However, the fuel
materials that will be available for reprocessing
after having been used in engineering test units
at ORNL and at Pratt & Whitney will contain
CrF, as the major contaminant.

If the used material is stored in contact with
air, considerable amounts of ZrO, and/or ZrOF,
will be formed by hydrolysis when it is reheated,
and these compounds could also cause trouble
in the reprocessing steps. lt is possible, however,
to handle and to store the material so that such
hydrolysis is negligibly small. In that event the
only contaminant present that would not be re-
moved by the normal processing procedure would
be the CrF,, which would probably be present
to the extent of 500 to 1500 ppm chromium,

To achieve nearly quantitative reduction of
CF, to Cr a considerable fraction of the UF
must be reduced to UF,. Since the solubility
of UF, in NaF-ZrF, melts is relatively low, even
at 800°C, the amount of reductant must be closely
controlled. If this reduction is performed in the

. standard production equipment, the subsequent

hydrofluorination merely reoxides the UF, to UF,

... and redissolves the Cr° as CrF,; accordingly,

the reduction must be accomplished in auxiliary

. equipment, and the reduced melt must be filtered

into the production equipment.
= Two experiments were performed on 3-kg batches

 

 

of purified NaF -ZrF, +UF, mixture to test the

Effect of ZrO, in Fuel Preparation |
F. L. Daley
Materials Chemistry Division

Since ZrO, is expected to be a common con-
taminant in commercial ZrF,, studies have been
made in order to ascertain the efficiency of con-

version of ZrO, to ZrF, in the present equipment.

Appropriate 5-lb mixtures of NaF-ZrF ,-ZrO,-UF ,
which would yield, after complete hydrofluorina-
tion, 50 mole % NaF, 46 mole % ZrF,, and 4 mole %
UF, were prepared. A maximum of 10 wt % ZrO,
was used. The samples were hydrofluorinated in
the usual manner ot 800°C, and the exit gases
were periodically sampled by absorption of H,0
and HF in pyridine. The resulting liquid was
analyzed for fluoride and water.
though rather erratic during early stages of treat-
ment, indicated that the hydroflucrination effi-
ciency was not greater than 20% with the agite-
tion possible in the equipment used.

These analyses,

If only 20% efficiency were obtained in the
production plant, a 50-hr hydroflucrination period
would be required for complete conversion of a
100-kg batch containing 10% ZrO,. Such a pro-
longed period is quite impractical. It is obvious
that ZrO, contamination in the ZrF, must be kept
to a low figure if high throughput of fuel that
meets specifications is to be maintained.

Pilot-Scale Purification Operations

J. P. Blakely J. Truitt
C. R. Croft W. T. Ward
Materials Chemistry Division

Fifty-three batches totaling approximately 500
Ib of purified fluorides were processed in the
pilot-scale equipment during the quarter. This
material, including 22 batches of BeF ,-bearing
compositions, was made up entirely of specidl
batches for use in physical property determina-
tions, phase equilibrium studies, and other pro-
grams requiring small batches of fluoride mixtures
of possible interest as fuels. The study of proc-
essing techniques for the purification of BeF,-
bearing compositions has continued to indicate
that further refinements will be necessary before
consistently high-quality material can be pro-
duced. The BeF, used as charge material has
been found to contain carbonaceous occlusions,
which are believed to contribute to the high sulfur
content of the material. The relation between
carbon and sulfur content in some typical, finished
batches is shown in the following:

Carbon (wt %) Sulfur (ppm)

No attempts have been made to exceed this rate

Preparation of ZrF

A. J. Gully
Materials Chemistry Division

Zirconium tetrafluoride has been obtained in the

‘past from the Y-12 Production Divi sion, which has
operated a facility for converting ZrCl, to ZrF,

at a maximum rate of 250 Ib per week. While most
of the demands for processed fluorides have been
met thus far, it appears that a source of supply
capable of producing 400 to 600 ib of ZrF, per
week will be necessary.

_ Pilot-scale apparatus for converting ZiCl, to

ZF, by direct hydrofluorination at a relatively
= low temperature (200 to 300°F) has been designed,
_ built, and tested. Since analyses of the product
from this equipment have made the process appear

to be very attractive, a unit capable of yielding

1000 Ib of ZF, per week has been designed, and

fabrication of the equipment has begun. This
facility is expected to be in operation by mid-
September 1955. Experimental operations are being

Various private vendors have also been con-

_tacted as possible suppliers of suitable material.
"To date, only one vendor has submitted samples

which appear to be reasonably promising, and he
has been requested to submit a larger sample, for

actual charging to small-scale processing equip-

able final product. Tests of this material will
be made in the near future. At present, it is not

more economical than material prepared at ORNL
from hafnium-free ZiCl,.

Batching and Dispensing Operations

J. P. Blakely F. A. Doss
oo Materials Chemistry Division

Approximately 100 batches totaling 4129 ib of

.. various fluoride compositions were dispensed in
batch sizes ranging from 1 to 250 lb, Operational

difficulties plus a downward revision in estimated
usage of processed fluorides in the ANP program
by both ORNL and off-area consumers have, it
appears, postponed the time of maximum fluoride
consumption to October-November of this year.
With presently known testing schedules, an aver-
age demand of between 4000 and 4500 Ib of proc-
essed fluorides per month should prevail during
the fiscal year 1956.

A substantial gain in stock inventory was made
during the quarter, despite the fact that the in-
adequate ZrF, supply curtailed production by
several thousand pounds. A material balance
for this quarter follows:

Pratt & Whitney Aircraft reduced their original
request for 4750 Ib to 1150 1b of processed fluo-
rides for this period; however, to prevent a pos-
sible shortage of material for ORNL-ANP usage

while the ZrF, supply problem is being resolved,
“only 750 1b of material was shipped to them. Other

off-area shipments included 44 Ib to Wright Air

Development Center and 73 1b to Battelle Memorial
Institute.

Successful attempts to fill four 50-Ib cans simul-
taneously from a 250-Ib batch were made, and
the practice was extended to smaller batches.
The time required to perform these operations
was, accordingly, reduced.

Loading end Draining Operations

N. V. Smith

‘Materials Chemistry Division

The operations necessary for filling, draining,
and sampling of charge material in all test equip-

ment other than the thermal-convection loops

have continued at a rate comparable to that of
the previous quarter, Over 50% of the operations
have involved the handling of alkali metals.

With the rapid increase in testing of alkali
metals, consideration of safe, ropid methods
of disposal of used metals became necessary.
Commercial vendors will not accept the metals
for reprocessing. The small-scale methods of
disposal formerly used have become inadequate
for the quantities now involved. Information ob-
tained from the Mine Safety Appliances Co. led
to the installation of an underwater jet through
which NaK is forced aot 30 psi under 10 ft of water
in the disposal quarry. It is now possible to
dispose of NaK at a rate of about 30 Ib/min. With
proper heating of the lines leading to the jet, this
installation could be used for sodium disposal.

The ART high-temperature critical assembly was
loaded with approximately 750 Ib of NaF-ZrF
(50-50 mole %) and sufficient NaF- UF, (66.7-33.3
mole %) to reach criticality. Most of the NaF-UF ,
was added by helium pressure transfer of the
molten material in approximately 5-1b increments.
The final titration to criticality was made by using
the enriching system designed by the ARE Division
for the experiment; the enriching system had pre-
viously been filled with fuel concentrate. After

each significant addition of Na, UF, the sump

was sampled; the uranium content was determined
by the ANP Analytical Chemistry Group.

from these cells is complicated because the solid
phase in equilibrium with the melt is not the simple
metal fluoride; evidence reported in a previous
portion of this section suggests strongly that
complex compounds of which NiF,:ZrF , is typical
are formed. Accordingly, when M and M' are
both Cr® for example, and when the two half cells
contain CrF, in different amounts, both sufficient
to saturate the solution at temperature, small but
reproducible and significant potentials are ob-
served. For example, when one half cell contains
7.8% and the other contains 12.6% CrF, (solubility
of CrF, at 700°C is 5.8%), the emf of the cell
varies from 15 mv at 550°C to 8 mv at 700°C.
This potential arises because the CrF, added
in excess of the saturation concentration ‘‘pre-
cipitates’ ZrF, and thus changes the composition
of the solvent and affects the activities of the
ZrF, and of the NaF to a different extent in the
two half cells.

cells of this type are shown in Table 4.15. It

Activity of Chromium in Inconel
M. B. Panish

Materials Chemistry Division
As a foundation for future studies of thermo-
galvanic effects in fused-salt melts contained in
Inconel systems, an attempt has been made to
determine the activity of chromium in Inconel.
The electromotive forces of several cells of two
types have been determined over a temperature
range of 550 to 800°C, The cells being studied

are:

trode as a result of an internal discharge in cells
of type 1.
A reaction that might possibly occur is

3CrF ,=2CrF, + Cr°

if such an equilibrium did exist, there would be
a different equilibrium concentration of CrF, and
CrF, around each electrode because of the differ-
ence in concentration of metallic chromium in the
electrodes. If, as in cells of type 1, it is possible
for convection currents to carry solution from one
electrode to the other, an internal discharge of
the cell may occur.

Cells of type 2 are obtained experimentally by
using two recrystallized alumina containers, one
within the other. The electrodes are placed so
that one is in the inner container and one is be-
tween the two container walls. The salt mixture
is placed in and around the inner container.

The results obtained with cells of type 2 are
somewhat erratic, but there is a general trend
that is shown by the data plotted in Fig. 4.4.
Further investigation will be necessary to clarify
these results. Particular attention will be paid
to the purification of starting materials and to

Viscosities of Molten Nitrates

F. A. Knox F. Kertesz
Materials Chemistry Division

The capillary viscometer, previously described, 28
has been calibrated by using pure LiNO, and
KNO, and has been used to measure the viscosity
of a mixture of these materials. Attack by LiNO,
on glass at high temperatures has necessitated sub-
stitution of a nickel capillary for these studies.

Measurements obtained?® for KNO, are in close
agreement with those reported by Dantuma?® and
by Goodwin and Mailey.3% Values for LiNO,
agree reasénably well with those presented by
Goodwin and Mailey but are nearly 20% below
those of Dantuma,

A mixture of the two salts (62.2 wt % KNO 3)

however, the viscosity increases more rapidly

High-Temperature X-Ray Spectrometer Studies
G. D. White, Metallurgy Division
T. N. McVay, Consultant

Samples of 3LiF«ZrF , were x-rayed at elevated
temperatures by using the furnace attachment to
the x-ray spectrometer. The investigation was
conducted to confirm the decomposition tempera-
ture of Li, ZrF,, which had already been deter-
mined by quench methods and thermal data, and
also to determine whether there was o high-
temperature polymorph of Li,ZrF, that was not
retained when the material was quenched,

At room temperature the samples contained three
phases: Li,ZrF,, LijZrF,, and LiF. In this
study the procedure was to heat the mounted
sample in the evacuated furnace attachment to
550°C and then maintain it at that temperature
until the x-ray diffraction pattern contained none
of the Li, ZrF or LiF peaks. The reacted sample
was then cooled to various temperatures until the
x-ray pattern indicated the presence of Li, ZrF
andLiF. In this manner the decomposition tempera-
ture was determined as being 470°C, which is
to be compared with the value of approximately
475°C obtained by quench methods. At no tem-
perature above 470°C was the x-ray pattern for
the low-temperature form of Li,ZrF, obtained.
The high-temperature x-ray pattern, presented be-
low, is evidently the pattern for a polymorph of
Liz ZrF,, which inverts to the lower temperature
form at a temperature just slightly above the de-
composition temperature:

conductance at corresponding temperatures has
been correlated with such properties as ion size
and mass. Conductance has been treated as a
rate process, and values of the heat of activation
and entropy of activation have been computed
from experimental data, In general, the heat of
activation is somewhat temperature dependent;
this dependence is approximately linear for lithium,
sodium, and potassium salts, while it deviates
progressively more from linearity with rubidium
and cesium salts. The entropy of activation for
these salts is in the range of —6 to —8 eu. This
small negative entropy of activation is reason-
able and indicates a similar conduction mechanism
for all the salts, but no detailed quantitative
significance can be attached to it at this time.

An extensive series of freezing-point-depression
measurements has been made in which molten
sodium nitrate was the solvent, The heavy-metal
halides CdCl,, ZnCl,, CuCl,, PbCl,, and CdBr,
all show less than complete ionic dissociation
in molten sodium nitrate; dissociation decreases
as conceniration rises. However, the slopes
of the curves indicate complete dissociation at
infinite dilution. The significant discovery has
been made that the scecalled ‘‘common ion effect’
is generally applicable to these salts. Thus the
addition of any of a large number of completely
dissociated chlorides greatly represses ionic
dissociation of partially dissociated chlorides such
as PbCl, and CdCl,. It has been demonstrated
in the case of CdCl, that the complex ion CdCl, ~~
is formed in the presence of relatively low con-
centrations of excess common chloride ion. Re-

actions have been proposed to account for the

results, and equilibrium constants have been cal-
Apparently those chlorocadmium com-
plexes containing even numbers of chlorines are
the more stable,

B efficients of sodium ion and of nitrate ion have

This is the first time that self- diffusion of both
“ions. of a single fused salt has been measured.
“It is highly significant that the heats of activa-
“tion for self-diffusion of both the cation and the
anion are the “same within experimental error
~(~80 cal). This indicates that there is a single
frictional coefficient for diffusion within the melt.
The results’ ‘show that the simple Nernst-Einstein
"equation is inapplicable to this molten salt; it
is probably not applicable to any molten salt,
The ratio of self-diffusion coefficients for Na*
and NO, is somewhat less than the inverse ratio
of the square roots of the masses of the two ions.
It is expected that both mass and size are im-
portant factors in determining diffusion. Experi-
ments are in progress with other fused salts, and
attempts will be made to obtain generalizations

Diffraction Studies of Liquids

Chemistry Division

The previously described®?:33 liquid diffrac-

tometer has been thoroughly aligned and tested
and is being applied to studies of molten salts,
X-ray diffraction patterns obtained from liquid
mercury at room temperature were used to test the
instrument; the patterns were satisfactory. These
diffraction patterns and the analysis giving in-
formation concerning the distribution of atoms
within the liquid have been presented.®® It has
been possible to obtain data which appear to be
reliable to a somewhat larger value of the variable

= (4% sin 6)/A than that reported in the litera-
ture. Work is under way with molten lithium
chloride.

Neutron diffraction work on molten salts is also
being carried on so that information from the two
techniques can be coordinated. The equipment 34

Several Inconel forced-circulation loops that
were operated with fluoride mixtures and with
sodium as the circulated fluids were examined.
The effect of operating time on corrosion and
mass transfer under the dynamic conditions was
studied for loops that circulated NaF-ZrF -UF,,
as well as the effects of the method of heating the
loop and of the length of the heated section. The
loops in which sodium was circulated were used
to study the effects on mass transfer of varying
the temperature differential in the system and of
varying the oxide content of the sodium and were
used to compare mass transfer in Inconel and in
type 316 stainless steel.

Additional Inconel thermal-convection loops
were examined to determine the effects on cor-
rosion and mass transfer, in loops that circulated
fluoride mixtures, of varying the loop cleaning
method, of using direct resistance heating, and of
applying electromotive forces. In one loop, the
wall temperatures in the heated zone were
measured. The effects of oxide additions were
studied in loops that circulated sodium,

Several hot-pressed metal-bonded tungsten
carbide cermets were screen tested in NaF-ZrF UF
and in sodium, and additional solid-phase bonding
tests of cermets were made. Inconel plated with

“ruthenium was ‘subjected to creep-rupture tests,
and additional tests of brazed T-joints in fluoride

mixtures and in sodium were made. A Hastelloy

Examinations were completed of several Inconel
forced-circulation loops in which NaF-ZrF ,-UF
(50-46-4 mole %) was circulated. The loops and
the operating conditions are described in Sec. 2,
‘‘Experimental Reactor Engineering’ and in the
previous report. The corrosion data reported in
Table 5.1 and the analyses of the fluoride mixtures
given in Table 5.2 were for Inconel loops operated
with a temperature differential of 200°F, a
Reynolds number of the fluoride mixture of 10,000,
a maximum fluoride-mixture temperature of 1500°F,
and a maximum wall temperature of between 1600
and 1625°F. These loops were heated by direct
resistance of the Inconel tubing.” Loops 4695-4A,
-4B, -4C, -4D-1, and -4D-2 were a single loop in
which the two heated legs? were replaced at the
end of each experiment, A new batch of fluoride
mixture was used for cleaning and operating each
test. The loop was cleaned by circulating the
fluoride mixture for 2 hr at 1300°F. The loop was
then filled for the test with a fresh batch of
fluoride mixture, which was circulated isothermally
for 25 hr before the temperature differential was
applied.
~The period of isothermal operation was for the
purpose of establishing chemical equilibrium.

It now appears ‘that 25 hr a

the depth of attack ‘and the chromium concentration
were still’ quite “low. During the subsequent first’

few hours of operation with a ‘temperature differ-
ential and a high wall temperature, the attack was
quite rapid, with more attack being found after the

first 10 hr of operation than “had previously

occurred in 25 hr of isothermal operation. After
the first 50 hr the chromium content of the fluoride
mixture remained constant, but the depth of attack
increased, in confirmation of the thermal-con-
vection-loop data on mass transfer. Considerable
scatter is present in the data, but a depth of attack
of between 3 and 4 mils per 1000 hr of circulation
seems to be a reasonable value for the second
stage of attack. Typical hot-leg sections from
these loops are shown in Fig. 5.1.

 

Two * other loops (4950-2 ’ and 4935- -2) ‘were

operated in as nearly “an ‘identical manner as

possible, except that one was heated in a gas

furnace ‘and the other was heated by the direct
electrical resistance of the pipe wall. Both loops
were operated for 1000 hr, with NaF-ZrF ,-UF,
(50-46-4 mole %) as the circulated fluid, a tempers
ature differential of 200°F, a maximum fluoride
temperature of 1500°F, and a fluoride-mixture
Reynolds number of 5000. In both loops a moderate

concentration of subsurface ‘voids to a maximum

depth of 5 mils was found. A typical area from
the electrically heated loop is shown in Fig. 5.2.
These loops had 17-ft-long heated sections to
keep the wail temperatures down and to show that
a low rate of attack may be achieved with low

wall ‘temperatures, The depth of attack does not

increase the ‘power per unit of heater length, which
resulted in a 100°F increase in wall temperature,
This loop showed heavy subsurface-void attack
to a depth of 18 mils. These data are additional
evidence that the wall temperature is a more
critical variable than is the fluoride-mixture
temperature. A series of loops with varying,
but controlled, wall temperatures are now being
operated,

Sodium in Inconel and in Stainless Steel

G. M. Adamson A, Taboada
Metallurgy Division

Two Inconel forced-circulation loops (4951-2
and 4951-3) in which sodium was circulated were
examined after operating for 500 hr with a hot-leg
temperature “of 1500°F. Loop 4951-2 had a 300°F
temperature differential, and loop 4951-3 had a
150°F temperature differential. The two loops
were of a test series which included loop 4951-1,
operated previously, which had a temperature
differential of 200°F. Table 5.3 presents the
metallographic and chemical data obtained in
this series of tests,

No correlation can be observed between the
amount of mass transfer and the temperature
differential. However, the three loops were not
identical, and high oxide impurities of different
amounts were found in these loops. The results
of these differences could have obscured the
effects of the different temperature differentials,

tests were reported previously, but the data are

repeated here to present a complete summary, The

data from the completed series of tests are
presented in Table 5.6.

The loop that was operated for 2000 hr with a
positive charge applied to the hot leg showed
only about one-half the depth of attack found in
the loop operated with a negative charge applied
to the hot leg. With a negative hot leg, the depth
of attack was about the same as that found in
the control loop with no applied potential, From
these few data, it does not appear that small

stray potentials will increase the attack. Although
it would be difficult to apply a potential in a

system as complicated as a reactor, it appears
that it would be possible to reduce the attack by
applying a positive potential,

Effect of Oxide Additions to Sodium

A series of Inconel thermal-convection loops

was operated with varying amounts “of Na 20,
added to the sodium being circulated to determina

whether mass transfer in the system was ‘caused Co

by oxide impurities in the sodium.
The data obtained, presented in ‘Table 5.7,

hot leg of each loop. The deposit in each section
was brushed out and weighed, and the weight
value was converted to an average weight per
inch. These values, given in Table 5.7, are
relative and subject to considerable error. They
do show, however, increased mass transfer with
increased oxide content.

The increased mass transfer was also reflected
in increased attack in the hot legs. The depths
of attack varied from 1.5 mils in the control loops
to 4 mils in the high-oxide-content loops. The
attack was primarily intergranular, with, possibly,
some general surface removal, Some difficulty
was encountered with the loop supports during
this series of tests, and operation of several
loops had to be terminated because of leaks.
‘This difficulty now appears to have been corrected.

Several Haynes Stellite Company, experimental,
hot-pressed, metal-bonded, tungsten carbide
specimens have been screen tested in NaF-ZrF,-UF,
{(53.5-40-6.5 mole %) and in sodium in the seesaw

apparatus at 4.25 cpm. The hot and cold zones
were at 1500 and 1200°F, respectively. Each
specimen was held in the hot zone of its capsule
during the 200-hr test period. The nominal
compositions of the materials tested are given in
Table 5.8.

Metallographic examination of the untested and
tested specimens did not reveal any measurable
attack on any of the tested specimens. It did

show that the structure was, in general, good.

The tungsten carbide particles were small, and
the specimens had little porosity. The tungsten
carbide and metal distributions were good, with
the exception that there were small isles of metal
that was free of tungsten carbide particles in all
specimens. These isles were few and small in
the specimens that had more than 20% metal.
Typical untested and tested 88% tungsten carbide

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

Further evaluation of the best of the nonbonding
cermets, as determined by the original and re-

checking tests, will be made in solid-phase
bonding tests of these materials in the form of
valve disks and seats. It is planned to study the
resistance to solid-phase bonding for long periods
of time, 1000 hr or more; the effects, if any, of
braze-joining the cermets to Inconel (cf. Sec. 6,
“Metallurgy and Ceramics’); and, possibly, the

effects of repeated seatings of the disks and seats.

Effects of Ruthenium on Physical
" Properties of Inconel
"C.F. Leitten, Jr.
Metallurgy Division

Since the examinations of various sections of
the ARE4 and the LITR fluoride-fuel loop5
revealed slight deposits of ruthenium metal on
the walls of the Inconel tubes, the effect of
ruthenium on the physical properties of Inconel
is being studied. A thin layer of ruthenium metal
was electrodeposited from a solution of ruthenium
nitrosochloride on an Inconel creep-test specimen.
The thickness of the ruthenium plate on the
Inconel was approximately 1.5 mils. The plated
creep-test specimen was annealed in an evacuated
Inconel capsule for 100 hr at 1500°F to allow the
ruthenium to diffuse into the specimen. The
specimen was then given a creep-rupture test in a
purified argon atmosphere at a stress of 3500 psi.
In calculating the stress, the area of the ruthenium
plate was included. The results of the creep-
rupture tests on the ruthenium-plated Inconel and
on an unplated, standard, Inconel specimen are
presented in Table 5.10, Since a difference in
rupture times was found, another test is now in
progress to check the results,

A metallographic examination of the strained
portions of the ruptured ruthenium-plated Inconel
specimen showed no difference in microstructure
in comparison with that of a ruptured, unplated,
Inconel specimen (Fig. 5.9). Creep-rupture tests
are also to be conducted on ruthenium-plated
Inconel specimens in the fused-salt mixtures,

Brazing Alloys on Inconel and on Nickel in

C. F. Leitten, Jr.
Metallurgy Division

Seesaw tests have been completed on a series
of brazing alloys on Inconel T-joints. These

tests were conducted in sodium and in the fuel

mixture NaF- ZF, -UF, (53.5-40-6.5 mole %) for
100 hr af a hot-zone ‘emperature of 1500°F. A
temperature differential of approximately 400°F
was maintained between the hot and cold zones
of the test container. The data obtained from
weight measurements and metallographic ex-
amination of the tested T-joints are given in
Table 5.11. The 82% Au-18% Ni brazing alloy
and copper were tested only in the fuel mixture,
because previous corrosion data had indicated
the poor corrosion resistance of these alloys in
sodium. The seesaw test on the Coast Metals
No. 52 brazing alloy was a retest; the results
agree with those previously reported.

The Coast Metals No. 53 brazing alloy and
Electroless nickel showed good corrosion resistance
to both mediums, as indicated in Table 5.11. The
Inconel T-joints brazed with Coast Metals alloy
No, 53 are shown in Fig. 5.10 after exposure to
the fuel mixture NaF- ZrF ,-UF, (53.5-40-6.5 mole %)
in a seesaw test for 100° hr at a hot-zone tempera-
ture of 1500°F and after exposure to sodium under
the same conditions. Only slight attack can be
seen along the surface of the braze fillet exposed
to the fuel mixture; the fillet exposed to sodium
showed similar slight surface attack.

Brazing Alloys on Inconel and on
Stainless Steel in Lithium

C. F. Leitten, Jr.

Corrosion tests have been completed on three
brazing alloys — Nicrobraz, 73.5% Ni~10% Si-16.5%
Cr, and 71% Ni-16.5% Cr-10% Si=2.5% Mn — on
type 316 stainless steel and Inconel T-joints in
static lithium at 1500°F for 100 hr to verify
corrosion results previously obtained.

The results obtained from weight measurements

and metallographic examination of the tested

 

 

 
 

 

   
    
     

735 NISI0Si-16.5Cr

specimens are presented in Table 5.12. All
the brazing alloys exhibited poor corrosion
resistance to lithium, and the attack was more
severe on the brazing alloys on type 316 stainless
steel. This is probably due to the difference in
nickel concentrations in type 316 stainless steel
(10 to 14%) and Inconel (75 to 80%). Since nickel
is preferentially attacked by lithium, the attack
on the Inconel T-joints would be uniform on both
the base material and the brazing alloys, which
in these tests contained approximately the same
nickel concentrations as Inconel. However, the
attack would be more concentrated on the brazing
alloys on type 316 stainless steel T-joints, be-
cause most of the nickel would have to be leached
from the brazing alloy in order to reach the
solubility limit of nickel in lithium. The results
of these tests corroborated the results of the
previous tests; that is, the nickel-base brazing
alloys have very poor corrosion resistance to
lithium, especially when used to braze iron-base
alloys.

Hastelloy B-Inconel in NaF- LZrF UF,

R. Carlander
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft

A static test of a Hastelloy B specimen in an
Inconel capsule containing a fuel mixture was
performed to determine whether dissimilar-metal

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1955

mass transfer occurred in such an isothermal
system. The fuel mixture was NaF-ZrF,-UF,
(50-46-4 mole %), and the system was held for 100
hr at a temperature of 1600°F. The Hastelloy B
specimen showed a negligible weight loss of
0.0003 g, but no attack could be detected
metallographically.  Spectrographic analysis re-
vealed that no molybdenum had transferred to the
Inconel capsule wall,

Two 5-mil cuts were machined from the surface
of the Hastelloy specimen and analyzed spectro-
graphically to determine whether chromium had
been picked up from the Inconel tube. Since
there was no detectable difference in the chromium
content of the two cuts, it appears that no ap-

~ preciable quantity of chromium had transferred.

The surfaces of the Hastelloy B specimen and of
the [Inconel container are shown in Fig. 5.11.
Inconel is normally attacked to a depth of 2 mils
in an all-lncone! static test system under similar
test conditions. The presence of Hastelloy B
in the system increased the observed attack on the
Inconel to a depth of 8 mils,

nickel or in iron-base alloy systems has a con-
siderable effect on the amount of mass transfer
that occurs in the system. Therefore, in order to
study mass transfer in a system in which the
oxygen content could be held to a very low level,
a boiling-sodium loop test was run. The loop is
shown in Fig. 5.12. The temperatures around the
loop during the 400-hr test are indicated. There
are two traps for liquid sodium in the condenser
leg of the loop. The first trap is filled with hot,

freshly condensed sodium during the test. This
is an ideal location for metal solution to occur.

The second trap catches the overflow from the
first trap and operates at a considerably lower

‘temperature. This is an ideal location for metal

deposition to occur. Three nickel cooling coils
are located on the condenser leg, and air flow

- through these coils is regulated to maintain the

desired temperatures. The boiler and the small
return line to the boiler are the only areas where
heat is applied. The first test was terminated

after 400 hr, when a small leak was detected i

the coolest section of the bottom return line.

tinued. Previous results? emphasized, contrary
to generally accepted oxidation theory,}® that
sodium forms a highly protective oxide film in dry
oxygen. The research has, also, in some measure,
filled the gap which exists in the experimental
oxidation data for the alkali and alkaline-earth
metals. Finally, the results indicate a consider-
able similarity between the oxidation of sodium
and other, more extensively studied, metals, such
as copper and aluminum. In this respect, addi-
tional evidence has been obtained in support of the
idea expressed by Cabrera and Mott?! that all
metals have comparable oxidation mechanisms at
relatively low temperatures.

Oxidation-rate measurements for sodium were
made manometrically. A film of sodium was
evaporated onto the walls of a small glass bulb
attached to one arm of a sensitive differential
manometer, The course of the reaction could
then be followed by measuring the decrease in
pressure in the bulb as the oxidation proceeded.
The details of the experimental apparatus have
already been described. ?

During the period covered by this report, most of
the experimental work has been devoted to the
measurement of oxidation rates at 25 and 48°C
over extended periods of time. At these two tem-
peratures and also at 35°C, experiments lasting
between 15,000 and 20,000 min have been com-
pleted.

Such prolonged experiments were considered
necessary for two reasons. First, they are re-
quired if a realistic determination is to be made of
the analytical form of the rate curves. Because
there may be a gradual change in the reaction
mechanism as oxidation proceeds and on account
of ‘unavoidable errors in experimental measure-
ments, ao misleading impression of an oxidation
cufve can easily be obtained when data for only
the first portions of the curve are available.

A second reason for such extended tests was
that some metals (for example, columbium) undergo
abrupt changes in oxidation mechanism after a
relatively thick oxide film has developed on them.

It was important to determine whether or not sodium

‘is subject to this phenomenon,

Seven rate determinations at 25°C and four at
48°C, all lasting for 17,000 to 20,000 min, have
been completed. Data from these, as well as the
measurements obtained at -79, =20, and 35°C,
are shown in Fig. 5.16. The change in pressure
in the system, which is a function of the oxide-
film thickness, is plotted against the time of
oxidation on a log-log plot. Each unit of the
vertical scale is equivalent to approximately 10 A
of oxide; therefore after 20,000 min at 48°C an
oxide thickness of almost 1400 A was attained.

Each curve of Fig. 5.16 represents the com-
posite of data from three or more experiments,
Deviations of as much as 10% in the total pressure
change were observed between readings at the
same time and temperature in different experiments,
An error of this magnitude was not considered
serious; a basic assumption in comparing the re-
sults of different experiments was that the areas
of the initial sodium films were the same. A new
oxidation bulb was used for each experiment, and
it was impossible to avoid slight variations in the
dimensions of these bulbs. Therefore the assump-
tion that the apparent surface area of the sodium
films was identical for all experiments was true
only to a first approximation. Perhaps even more
important was the possibility that the surface
roughness (and, therefore, the frue surface area) of
the sodium films differed slightly from experiment
to experiment. These two factors could easily
account for the observed variations in the experi-
mental results.

Mathematical analyses of the rate curves show
that none of the conventional oxidation-rate laws
was obeyed by sodium; that is, the data could not

- be fitted to rate equations of the form x” = kt (where

x is the oxide thickness after a time t, & is the
rate constant, and » = 1, 2, or 3) nor to the loga-
rithmic, x = k log , or the inverse logarithmic,
1/x = A — B In t, rate equations. The absence
of any abrupt changes in the oxidation curves
indicates that there were no sudden changes in
the mechanism of oxidation as the oxidation pro-
ceeded,

One interesting feature of the results was that

and behavior of the oxide films during the transition
from the parabolic to the linear rate would give
some indication of the criteria for linear oxidation
rates,

The first phase of the work consisted in a

careful redetermination, of the oxidation-rate
curves for columbium at 400°C. A manometric
technique, very similar to that used for the
oxidation of sodium,? was found to be satisfactory
for the rate measurements. The oxidation speci-
mens consisted of 1 x 2 cm strips cut from a
0.020-in.-thick sheet of columbium, The specimens
were electropolished mechanically with 4/0 emery
paper and then electropolished in a 10% HF-90%
H,S0, bath. One such strip was placed in a
100-cm® glass bulb attached to one arm of a
differential manometer. Octoil-S diffusion-pump
oil was used as the manometric fluid in order to
“obtain the desired pressure sensitivity. The
oxidation and reference bulbs of the manometer
were evacuated to a pressure of about 10=6 mm Hg
and then immersed, along with an oxygen reservoir,
in a molten-salt, constant-temperature bath. The
oxidation and reference bulbs were then filled
simultaneously with oxygen to identical pressures.
The absolute oxygen pressure was about 700 mm
Hg. The rate of oxidation was then determined by
measuring, with the manometer, the decrease in
pressure in the oxidation bulb, The use of an
accurately controlled constant-temperature bath
was considered necessary to avoid spurious
pressure changes arising from temperature differ-
ences in the oxidation and reference bulbs.

Four oxidation experiments have been completed
at or near 400°C. In each case the oxidation
curve was initially approximately parabolic and
then became linear as tHe time of oxidation
increased. The data from one of these experiments
is ‘shown in Fig. 5.17. The change of oxygen
pressure is plotted against the time of oxidation,
For reasons as yet unknown, the time at which
the transition from the parabolic to the linear
portions of the rate curves occurred varied some-
what from experiment to experiment, However, the
amount of oxygen which had been consumed by the
‘time the transition region was reached was found
to be relatively constant,

The oxide layers formed during the early stages
of the reaction exhibited the interference tints
typical of thin, transparent, oxide films. However,
das the reaction progressed, patches of a white,

opaque material developed on the surface of the
columbium specimens, These white areas ap-
peared under an optical microscope to be rough,
and it was assumed that they represented relatively
porous regions in the oxide film, X-ray ex-
amination of the oxidized specimens indicated
that both the white areas and those parts of the
oxide film that still showed interference colors
consisted of columbium pentoxide (Cby04). No
other oxides of columbium were detected.

Although the evidence is still not complete,
the occurrence of the regions of white oxide
seemed to be associated with the deviation of the
rate curves from their initial parabolic form. For
this reason it has been tentatively assumed that
the white portions of the oxide film represent the
type of oxide film which produces a linear reaction
rate. In order to study the nucleation and growth
of this white oxide, a hot-stage microscope has
been constructed and is being tested. This

apparatus should allow direct observation of the

oxide films as they are formed.

An attempt is being made to express the over-all
oxidation-rate equation for columbium as the sum
of parabolic and linear terms approximately
weighted to take into account the fraction of the
total surface area oxidizing according to each of
the two mechanisms. Complete formulation and
testing of this equation awaits further data
concerning the growth characteristics of the

areas of white oxide. It is hoped that this infor-
mation can be obtained from observations of the
oxidation under the hot-stage microscope.

High-Temperature Spectrophotometry in

deep with parallel flat sides); the stainless steel
cell holder, tube header, etc.; a quartz tube with
optically flat windows; a glass vacuum system;
and a furnace with light-path openings. A controlled
atmosphere can now be maintained over the melt
during spectral measurements, and, in addition,
the cell can be dry-box-loaded with previously
dehydrated hydroxide. This prevents etching of
the polished MgO cell faces by water vapor, as
was experienced with the previous apparatus.
It was thought that the deeper MgO cell would
reduce the creep problem. However, with the cell
fess than half full, the hydroxide was found to
creep over the top of the cell and down the sides
in a matter of minutes after melting. A still-
deeper MgO cell (~1 1 in.) is now being cut.

At the present time, a Coleman model 14
spectrophotometer modified for high-temperature
work is being used. This instrument is, of course,
inadequate for accurate work, and a Cary model 11
instrument is being acquired and will be rebuilt,

argon over metallic sodium contained in a Morganite
(Al, 0 5) crucible, After all the sodium had reacted,
the system was evacuated, and the hydroxide
was dehydrated by heating to 500°C at a pressure
of 10 pu. A small amount of hydroxide prepared in
this way from reagent-grade sodium is now being
used in the thermal-decomposition studies. In
these studies the small amount of ammonia present
in Baker's ‘‘reagent special’’ grade sodium
hydroxide might give misleading results.

Mass Transfer and Corrosion in Fused Hydroxides

M. E. Steidlitz
Metallurgy Division

Studies of the corrosion and mass: transfer of
nickel and Inconel by fused sodium hydroxide are
continuing in the “‘cold finger'’ apparatus.'4 In
addition, two new metals, copper and Monel, have
been checked under hydrogen, and the results

‘indicate that both are attacked to approximately
"the same extent as nickel. The mass transfer on

the Monel cold finger is interesting in that both
nickel- and copper-colored crystals are deposited.

It has been reported that additions of chromium
in fine particles eliminate mass transfer of
nickel.’ One addition of chromium as a single
lump, which was the only form available, was
made at 650°C under hydrogen. No change in
amount of mass transfer was noted. Addition of
a manganese sheet to the hydroxide at 650°C
resulted in transfer of manganese to the cold

finger.

components produced little, if any, reduction in
mass transfer over the temperature range 600 to

result was rechecked and confirmed. The electri»

The corrosion of Inconel by sodium hydroxide
at 800°C produces an interesting microscopic
structure. The unetched sample shown in Fig. 5.19
has little, if any, grain-boundary attack, the
depth of penetration being marked by laminar
formations within the grains. Samples of 25-mil

strips, Nos. 0 to 4, which were tested at 800°C
for 0, 7, 28, 54, and 100 hr, are shown in Fig. 5.20.
The results of spectrographic analyses of these
strips are presented in Table 5.15. Further work
on identification of the material deposited in the
Inconel is being planned.

have caused some speculation as to the species

of ions present at elevated temperatures. An

investigation of the thermal dissociation is one
of several studies being conducted to identify
these species.

The apparatus consists of an Alphatron pressure-
gage tube and a crucible machined from a single
crystal of magnesium oxide and connected through
a water-cooled copper block to a vacuum and a
gas-collection system, The hydroxide (B and A
reagent grade, carbonate-free, or prepared from
sodium metal and distilled water) is dehydrated
in situ at 400°C under vacuum for periods ranging
from several hours to several days. The temper-
ature is raised to 800°C, and then, after equilibrium
has been established, gas samples are taken for
mass spectrometric analysis, The residual
hydroxide has been analyzed, in some cases, by
wet chemical methods and, in one case, by x-ray
diffraction.

The gas-analysis results have been somewhat
erratic; they showed 2 to 89% water and 10 to 82%
hydrogen at total pressures of 4 to 5 mm Hg.
However, in every case, both gases have been
present, and their sum ranges from 74 to 99%, the
balance being contaminants, such as nitrogen,
which probably arise from air leaks. Wet chemical
analysis sheds no light on the residual hydroxide
content, but x-ray diffraction has identified sodium

Stability of UF; in NaF-KF-LiF in Inconel

H. J. Buttram R. E. Meadows

A series of mixtures of the NaF-KF-LiF eutectic
containing added UF, and UF, has been exposed
in sealed capsules of Inconel for times ranging
from 3 to 240 hr in the rocking furnace. The
capsules were heated and maintained at a hot-end
temperature of 800°C and a cold-end temperature
of 650°C. The rocker was operated at 4 cpm.
The total uranium contents of the mixtures studied
were 10 to 20 wt %. After exposure the capsules
were opened and unloaded in a helium-filled dry
box, and the cooled melts were ground and
~ analyzed chemically for UF; and UF.

As the data in Table 5.17 indicate, UF, is quite
unstable under these conditions, regardless of the
original UF,/UF, ratio. It appears that con-
siderable disproportionation of UF, must be
expected in this system under all circumstances,

Effect of Chromium on the Mass Transfer of

Nickel in NaOH

H. J. Buttram R. E. Meadows
F. A. Knox

Materials Chemistry Division

The effect of chromium on the mass transfer of
nickel by NaOH was tested in a nickel rocking
furnace. The exposures, at 4 cpm, were for 100 hr,
with the hot ends of the capsules at 775°C and
with a 100°C temperature drop along the capsules.

When 1 wt % Cr° was added to the purified
NaOH, the mass transfer of nickel was reduced
by about a factor of 2. However, in no case was
the mass transfer eliminated. Analyses of the
caustic revealed the presence of about 4000 ppm
Ni in the tests without chromium added to the
NaOH, while about 2500 ppm Ni and 3200 ppm Cr
were found in the caustic to which 1 wt % Cr® was

added.

This decrease in mass transfer presumably can
be explained by the reaction of Cr® with NaOH to
yield hydrogen gas, which tends to suppress the
reaction of NaOH with Ni°, Since hydrogen diffuses
readily through nickel metal at the test tempera-
ture, these experiments were repeated with the
nickel capsules enclosed in evacuated, sealed
quartz jackets. In addition, two capsules were
sealed in quartz envelopes containing hydrogen
at 540 mm Hg pressure. After 100 hr in the
rocking furnace, no mass transfer was found in
any of the capsules, except one for which the
quartz envelope had cracked. This lack of mass
transfer was evident, however, even in the control
capsules containing no chromium. Furthermore,
analyses of the caustic after the tests showed
quite low (less than 100 ppm) concentrations of
nickel and chromium. Pressures inside the quartz
envelopes, obtained by breaking the quartz inside
an evacuated standard volume, were about 350 mm
Hg (590 for the one initially set at 540 mm Hg).
The gas was not analyzed, but it is presumed that
it was hydrogen.

From these studies it is not apparent that
chromium is particularly beneficial. It does
appear, however, that some mechanism to prevent
loss of hydrogen from the system — perhaps
cladding the nickel with some metal impervious to
hydrogen — might be quite beneficial.

Stress-rupture testing of ¥-in. Inconel tubing in
argon and in fused salts at 1300, 1500, and 1650°F
is now in progress. Although data for Inconel
tubing at 1300 and 1650°F are as yet incomplete,
the results of tests of Inconel tubing with wall
thicknesses of 0.010, 0.020, 0.040, and 0.060 in.
at 1500°F in argon and in fused salts are suffici-
ent to show important trends,

In studying the biaxial stress system set up in
the tubes, the question arises as to whether failure
is related to the effect of combined stresses or

whether -the maximum stress component (in this
case, hoop stress) singularly controls the time to
failure. A comparison of the results of tensile
creep-rupture tests and tube-burst tests is pre-
sented in Fig. 6.1 for tests in argon and in Fig,
6.2 for tests in NaF-ZrF 4-UF, (5046-4 mole %).
It may be seen that there is Good agreement be-
tween rupture times for 0.060-in.~wall tubing and
0.060-in.~thick sheet in both environments. Thus,
the presence of an axial stress in the tubing does
not appear to affect the time to failure,

It may be noted, however, that the specimens
with thinner walls, 0.010 te 0.020 in., ruptured in
much shorter times than those observed for 0.060-
in.~thick sheet specimens at comparable stresses.
While this was originally thought to be due to the
effect of the combined stress system acting in the
tubing, it now appears from the results of tests on
0.020-in.-thick sheet that the poor rupture proper-
ties are associated with the smaller section thick-
ness.

was between that observed for a 7% Cr—20% Mo-—
73% Ni alloy ond that for a 10% Cr-20% Mo~70%
Ni alloy. Further, it is considered to be heat
resistant, and it forms a nonspalling oxide upon
oxidation. The samples from a vacuum melt of
Hastelloy B supplied by the Haynes Stellite Com-
pany showed no significant differences from com.
mercial grades of Hastelloy B. The 2.5% Be~
97.5% Ni alloy also forms a nonspalling oxide and
is considered to be heat resistant. The addition
of 5% Cb, however, increased the oxidation rate to
that observed for Hastelloy B.

Fabrication Studies

It was reported previously! that a deleterious
effect in nickel-molybdenum alloys containing
titanium, aluminum, vanadium, zirconium, colum-
bium, or chromium was noted after long heat treat-
ments in hydrogen. Additional similar tests were

1. H. Coobs, H. Inouye, and M. R. D'Amore, ANP

made to ensure that the effect was due to hydrogen

and not to the aging heat treatment. The check
tests were made on a 5% Cb-20% Mo-75% Ni

“alloy. The results of the tests, presented in

Table 6.4, verified that low strength and duc-
tility resulted from long exposure in hydrogen at
elevated temperatures. The tests also indicated
that the effect of hydrogen could ‘be removed by
vacuum annealing.

The possibility that a hydride forms during
aging has been suggested, but, if such is the
case, embrittlement in alloys containing chromium
and aluminum cannot be explained. The embrittie-

“ment effect was not detected in tests of Hastelloy

B and of the binary nickel-molybdenum alloys, and

it was not found in all the elevated-temperature

tensile tests of the ternary alloys that have been
studied.

Twelve extrusions of Hastelloy B were attempted
by the Babcock & Wilcox Co. to determine the
commercial feasibility of making tube blanks for
seamless tubing. This effort was supported by
the Haynes Stellite Company. Each of the twelve
extrusion attempts were unsuccessful because of
severe cracking of the tube blanks or failure to
extrude (‘‘stickers’’). The extrusion temperatures
used were between 2000 and 2250°F, Based upon
experience at ORNL, it is concluded that improper
temperatures, soaking time, and press capacity
were the main causes of failure.

Since this effort was made because successful
extrusions had been made at ORNL, additional ex-
periments were performed here to verify the recom-
mended extrusion conditions, to verify, with a
different heat, the superior redrawing properties of

the extruded tube blanks, and to o determine methods

for reducing. the pressure required for the extru-
sion. Two uncanned billets of Hastelloy B were
successfully extruded into tube blanks at an ex
trusion ratio of 5.5/1. The recommended condi-
tions were verified: namely, temperature, 2000°F;
‘heating time, 45 min per inch of billet thickness;
and extrusion pressure, 80 to 90 tsi. These tube
blanks are to be redrawn to small-diameter tubing.

A Hastelloy B billet canned in % ¢-ine-thick
Inconel was extruded at 2100°F at an extrusion
ratio of 5.5/1. The pressure required for this ex-
trusion was 55 tsi, as compared with 80 tsi for the
uncanned billets, A second canned extrusion was
made at a ratio of 9/1 at 2100°F with fair success,
At these temperatures, the first billet, if uncanned,
would have cracked severely, The high extrusion
ratio used for the second extrusion would have
caused the billet, if uncanned, to be a sticker.

The use of Inconel as canning material for
Hastelloy B is justified, since it serves a three-
fold purpose.. Besides acting as a lubricant, the
Inconel provides a thermally bonded oxidation-
resistant layer for the alloy. Also, in a high-
temperature air stream, the Inconel would inhibit
formation of the corrosive MoO, vapor, and thus
there would be no possibility of catastrophic oxi-
dation occurring in the structural material. More-
over, the clad Hastelloy B could probably be re-
duced more successfully than the unclad material,
because Inconel is not subject to “‘heat cracking,’
that is, surface cracking during annealing of cold

work that is attributable to poor themal conduc-.

tivity and a ? high rate of work hardening.

STRESS-RUPTURE TESTS OF HASTELLOY B

D. A. Douglas
Metallurgy Division

C. R. Kennedy
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft

A series of creep-rupture tests has been com.
pleted on solution.«annealed Hastelloy B at 1500
and 1650°F in the fluoride mixture NaF-ZrF +UF,
(50-46-4 mole %). The results are summarized in
design curves presented in Figs. 6.4 and 6.5. A
similar series of tests is nearly completed for
solution-annealed Hastelloy B at 1300 and 1800°F
in argon and in the fluoride mixture.

The influence of aging heat treatments on the
creep-rupture properties of Hastelloy B is being
studied at several temperatures ranging from 1300
to 1800°F. In general, aged specimens have
shown marked reductions in creep rate and tensile
elongations compared with specimens in the solu-
tion-annealed condition. Results obtained from
creep-rupture tests on solution-annealed and aged
specimens at 1500 and 1800°F in argon are pre-
sented in Table 6.5.

The creep-rupture properties at 1800°F are not
substantially affected by aging, since at this tem-
perature a single-phase alloy exists. However, at
1500°F, a second phase that appears upon aging
produces a marked change in the creep-rupture
properties of the alloy. It may be noted that for
stresses which produce a rupture life in excess of
100 hr for the solution-annealed material at 1500°F
the difference in rupture life of the solution-
annealed and aged specimens is small. This is

. understandable, since, during testing at this tem-
perature, the solution-annealed specimens actually

   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

age.” During testing at higher stresses, the solu-

of tion-annealed material does not age appreciably
e before rupture, and thus the rupture times for the
aged specimens are appreciably longer than those
: for the solution-annealed specimens.

Developments Tests

The oxidation resistance of high-temperature
brazing alloys under static conditions at 1500 and
1700°F and in cyclic service at 1500°F has been
reported.2:3 The results of cyclic tests at 1700°F
are reported in Table 6.7. It can be seen that the
extent of oxidation of brazed joints thermally
cycled from room temperature to 1700°F is greater
than that of joints tested at a constant tempera-
ture. The Coast Metals No. 52 alloy, which is
used extensively | in brazing high-conductivity-fin

FABRICATION OF TEST COMPONENTS :

Components for High-Temperature

P. Patriarca
Metallurgy Division

The fabrication of the Inconel core shell for the
high-temperature critical experiment required ex-
tremely close control of the distortion associated
with production of the girth weld. Preliminary
experiments were therefore conducted to determine,

quantitatively, the extent of distortion to be exe

pected. The first test consisted in the deposition
. of a butt weld between two cylindrical segments

4 in. in depth, Each segment was machined from
. a nominal, 12-in.-|D, sched-40 pipe, in which the
inside diameter was bored to 12,250 in, to improve
the roundness and the outside diameter was tumed
down to 12,500 in. to provide a 0,125-in, wall for
3 in. of the 4-in. depth. A stainless steel face
plate was tack-welded at 60-deg intervals to the
l-in. shoulder of each segment to provide a degree
of restraint intended to approximate that provided
by the tapered reduction in diameter of the island
sheath, Micrometer caliper measurements at 48
scribed positions indicated that a maximum change
of 0.030 in. occurred in the nominal 12.5-in. out-
side diameter, As was expected, the frequency of
large changes increased with increasing proximity
to the weld. Co oo

A second test was conducted to determine the
extent of distortion to be expected when butt.
welding the spun core segments with the aid of
mechanical support. Two 6-in.-deep Inconel cylin-
ders, 12.5 in, OD, Yin. wall, were butt-welded
, with an aluminum backing ring containing Lavite

inserts for support. Micrometer and dial-gage
measurements made at 96 positions on the weld-
‘ ment, before and after welding, indicated a maxi-
mum shrinkage of 0.020 in. on the 12.5-in. outside
diameter, that is, an improvement of 0.010 in. over
the shrinkage obtained without mechanical support.

second) is shown for each point, If a particular
frequency is chosen (80 kc/sec) and the effect of
varying the wall thickness of an Inconel tube is
investigated, the impedance curve will follow
through the points indicated by the open squares.
Hence, if Ye -in.-dia, 65-mil-wall, Inconel tubing
were being examined, the change in the resistive
component would be a sensitive measure of a
change in wall thickness. However, changes in
eccentricity also produce changes in the resistive
component, as shown by the curves through the
triangles. Thus, in order to interpret the measure-
ments in terms of the nature of the tubing flaws,
both the changes in the resistive and the reactive
components must be measured.

There is no instrument available at the present
time which will make an impedance type of
analysis over the wide range of frequencies
indicated in Table 6.8. Work with experimental
equipment has indicated, however, that such an
instrument is feasible but would require con-
siderable development work. As a result, emphasis
is now being placed upon the development of
suitable probe-type coils with which impedance
analyses could be made without changing frequency
for each different size of tubing. In addition, it
is felt that a probe coil, because of its small size,
would be more sensitive to small flaws than would
an encircling coil.

Since the eddy-current flaw-detection method

has many more unresolved problems than does the

method that employs ultrasonic equipment, the

located by dye-penetrant inspection have been
located with ultrasound. Alsg, subsurface defects
of equally small size haye been detected with
ultrasound and verified by metallographic exami-
nation. Experience indicates that defects located
on the inner surface will be similarly detected.
The conventional presentation of ultrasonic

data is on a cathode-ray tube as the ‘‘A’’ scan,

the vertical sweep being the signal strength and
the horizontal sweep being the distance (travel
time) from the crystal. This presentation is not
interpretable at high scanning speeds, since the
repetition rate of the flaw signals will be in
excess of 100 times per minute. Gated alarm
signals would also be unsatisfactory, since all
spurious signals, as well as flaw indications,
would pass through the gate. The less con-
ventional ‘‘B’* scan would present the defects as
a standing image of the tube cross section on a
17-in. cathode-ray tube. In this case, the vertical
sweep would be a scan of the ‘A’ type of
presentation, and the horizontal sweep would be
the rotation of the tube.

A “B’’ scan pattern from a tube having only
one defect in the particular cross section being
scanned is shown in Fig. 6.19. The defect, which
is represented by the diagonal line, was a non-
metallic stringer about 0.001 in. in diameter and
about Y in. long. This defect was longitudinal
and was located about 0.010 in. below the outer
surface of the tube and parallel to the tube axis.

 Graphite-Hydrogen Corrosion-Erosion
Shel EE Investigation oo

 Graphite-hydrogen- ‘systems at temperatures of
the order of 2400°C or higher are of interest for
nuclear rocket applications. An investigation
was carried out to determine whether hydrogen
flowing at a velocity of Mach 0.15 in high-density
graphite tubing t in. OD, 1 in. ID, 24 in, long)
at’ approximately 2400°C caused significant
corrosion-erosion of the graphite. Two types of
graphite specimens were used:  Graph-i-tite
(density, ~1.8 g/cm3), supplied by Graphite
Specialties Corporation, and commercial graphite
(density, ~1.55 g/cm3),

A schematic drawing of the apparatus used for
the high-temperature graphite-hydrogen experiment
is shown in Fig. 6.20. The graphite specimen was
heated electrically to 2400°C, and a nitrogen or
helium atmosphere was maintained in the specimen
until equilibrium conditions were reached. The
high-velocity hydrogen was applied for 10 min,

and then the hydrogen was replaced with helium

while the specimen was cooling. Data and results

“of the experiments are given in Table 6.9.

The average corrosion-erosion for the tests on
Graph-i-tite showed a loss of 0.0001 g/in.2 .sec,
It was noted that the weight losses were about
the same with helium as with hydrogen, and it is

“probable that the losses were due to water vapor
_in the gases. The bulk temperature of the hydrogen
-was believed to be about 1600°C, and the velocity

was about "1900 fps, or approximately Mach 0.18.

‘It was observed that the weight losses of the

commercial graphite were somewhat greater that

those of the Graph-i-tite.

Reagent-grade calcium fluoride was precalcined

at 700°C for 1 hr. The alumina wafers were
pressed similarly from fine-grained Al, 0, without
calcination, and then sintered at 1350°C for 1 hr.

The optimum pressing conditions for pelletizing
fluoride fuels in convenient shapes for loading
into a reactor are being studied. A pressure of
4000 psi was not sufficient to produce pellets of
NaF-ZrF ,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %) that had adequate

Columbium Research

‘The investigation of metal diffusion barriers
for use in the fabrication of Inconel-clad columbium
sheet was continued. As was previously re-
ported, 10 the interdiffusion between Inconel and
columbium at elevated temperatures is extensive,
The reaction products, which appear to be nickel-
columbium compounds, are brittle, and, because of
the difference in the coefficients of thermal
expansion between the metals, separation occurs
at the interface when the composite is cooled to
room temperature, The problem is not that of
preventing the formation of intermetallic compounds,
although this would be desirable, but primarily
that of selecting a suitable combination of metals
which will remain thermally bonded in service.
This is mandatory, since the composite is being
considered for use as a heat transfer surface.

The barrier metals to be studied were selected
somewhat at random, since the phase relationships
between columbium, the possible barrier metals,
and Inconel have not been thoroughly determined,
especially as to the nature of the compounds
which are formed. Vanadium, titanium, molybde-
num, tantalum, and copper have been evaluated
as the barrier metals,

Composites were fabricated by hot-rolling
capsules which had been evacuated at 1100°F to
at least 1 x 10=4 mm Hg. Rolling temperatures
between 1800 and 2100°F were used at reduction

schedules of 30 and 40% per pass. The total
reduction in thickness was about 5/1. No
particular effort was made to predetermine the
thickness of the columbium core or the Inconel

cladding. A final composite thickness of 0.020 in.

was evaluated, The barriers were calculated to
be 0.001 in. thick after being rolled. Cross
sections of strips that had been bent to form an
involute of a circle were examined microscopically.
The Inconel-vanadium-columbium composite in
the as-rolled condition withstood several 90-deg

bending reversals over a sharp radius. Microscopic

examination showed a reaction layer at the
vanadium-Inconel interface that was less than
0.0001 in. thick. The reaction layer was cracked
perpendicular to a tangent to the curved surface.
Since no separation occurred at the interface, this
composite could probably be formed to a desired
shape by cold spinning. After 100 hr at 1650°F,
the composite separated at the Inconel-vanadium
interface upon bending. The reaction layer at
this interface had increased to about 0.0005 in.
in thickness, and the vanadium layer had decreased
in thickness. After 500 hr at 1650°F, the composite
separated during sectioning. Microscopic exami-
nation showed that the vanadium layer had been
completely transformed to an intermetallic com-
pound.

An Inconel-titanium-columbium composite was
found to be unsatisfactory because of the formation
of a low-melting compound at the rolling tempera-
ture of 2100°F. The compound was brittle, and
separation of the composite occurred during
cooling. The experiment is to be repeated with a
lower rolling temperature,

An Inconel-tantalum-columbium composite was

isomorphous in several aspects, the composite
was not expected to be successful. Specifically,
this combination was tried to determine the effect
of the melting-point difference of the metals on
their diffusion rate with Inconel (columbium melts
at 4380°F; tantalum melts at 5425°F). It was

also desired to compare the properties of the

expected reaction products,

Examination of the composite after rolling at

2100°F showed a 0.0001-in.-thick reaction layer

at the I[nconel-tantalum interface, which ‘was
found to be brittle at room temperature. However,
separation did not occur after numerous 90-deg

the final shape of the disks when they were used
in three-ply extrusion.

Both flatenosed and 45-deg tapered dummy
blocks were used in front of equal thicknesses of

concentric “rings. In the two-ply extrusions,
deviations in thickness were about 15%. The

‘inner layer in both extrusions was thinner than

desired. In the three-ply extrusions, the inner

cladding was thinner and the outer cladding
“thicker by 15% than had been calculated. The
core of the extrusion showed no deviation from
the calculated thickness. The results obtained

to date in attempts to extrude concentric layers
of equal thicknesses are ‘summarized in Table 6.10.

The extrusions ‘containing molybdenum washers

‘were’ sectioned lengthwise and examined. The
se deformation across the tube wall was complex,

since both compression and tension were evident.

Tensile forces prevailed in the outer and inner

layers, while compression forces prevailed in the
zone in between. The original 0.010-in.-thick
molybdenum washers varied in thickness from
about 0.003 in. near the tube walls to 0.050 in.
at the middle of the tube wall.

The displacements of the molybdenum washers
from their starting positions were noted. After
extrusion, the washers could be located as
coordinates of a parabola of revolution, with the
axis being the center line of the tube. The shapes
of the separate washers differed along the length
of the extrusion. It is evident that because of the
tensile forces near the tube walls the flaws in
this zone in the starting billet will result in flaws
in the extrusion,

The aluminum bronzes are being considered as

Lead-Calcium Alloys

The chemical-analysis technique for evaluating .F
the creep resistance of lead-calcium alloys was
investigated. lt was determined that chemical
analyses were not indicative of the creep per-
formance of these alloys, because the normal
scatter of the data on the calcium content frequently
exceeded the desired calcium content of between
0.03 and 0.06%. The strengthening effect of
calcium can be realized only if it is present in
solid solution or as a compound with lead; that
is, if a portion of the calcium is present as CaO,
the beneficial effects of the calcium are lost,
Since the chemical analysis gives the total
calcium rather than the CaO content of the alloy,
the chemical analyses can serve only as a guide

calcium on the basis of analyses of three master
alloys containing 2% total calcium were found by
chemical analysis to contain 0.043, 0.030, and
0.059% calcium, respectively. In cantilever creep
tests at room temperature and 750-psi stress, the
deflections of these alloys at the end of a 2-in.

0.367 g of boron per cubic centimeter, or 97.4%

of the theoretical density. The disk was machined

to 6% in. in diameter with diamond tools, and
diffusion barriers of copper and stainless steel
were applied by flame-spraying. The barrier
layer thicknesses were 6 and 15 mils, respectively.

Attempts to fabricate the material for the
12Y-in.-OD ring by extruding a billet of compacted
BC-Cu powders canned with copper were unsuc-
cessful. Severe edge cracking of the material

occurred during extrusion and was probably due
to either too high an extrusion temperature or too
thin ao copper can. After the unsuccessful
extrusions, the ring was fabricated by drawing a
round copper tube filled with B,C powder into a
rectangular tube with a %e x % in. cross section,
The tube was then roll-formed to a 12%-in.-OD
ring and split into two equal segments for ease
of assembly. The open ends of the tube were
closed with boron carbide—copper plugs. The
ring contained approximately 2.25 g of boron per
inch of length. A 7-mil layer of type 430 stainless
steel was flame-sprayed onto the ring to act as a
diffusion barrier.

Inconel tube gave results which were 40% below =

the general turbulent-fiow heat transfer correlation.
These results (Fig. 7.1) have been duplicated
in recent experiments in which a type 316 stainless
steel tube was used. It was not possible to
examine the inside surface of the stainless steel
tube, because the experiment was terminated by
the melting of the test section. However, it is
believed that there were probably no surface
deposits on the stainless steel tube, which was
the same case in earlier experiments with
NaF-KF-LiF (11.5-42-46.5 mole %). Thus, the
reduction in heat transfer obtained with this
fluoride mixture is probably due to something
other than the formation of surface deposits.

Some evidence exists which indicates that the
NaF-KF-LiF-UF | composition contained particulate
matter that made it a dilute slurry. However,

effect of this feature on heat and momentum

ART FUEL. TO. Nak HEAT EXCHANGER

J. L. Wantland
Reactor Experimental Engineering Division

For the recent experiments with the ART fuel-to-
NaK heat exchanger! the tube bundle was heated
by passing an electric current through it; water
was circulated outside the tubes, but there was
no fluid flow through the tubes. The fuel heat
transfer coefficients were determined by measuring
tube-wall and mixed-mean-fluid temperatures, as
well as heat transfer rates. As is shown in
Fig. 7.2, the data obtained corroborated the heat
transfer coefficients previdusly determined by
using the apparatus as a water-to-water heat
exchanger.

Also, the heat transfer and isothermal friction
characteristics of the fuel side of the heat
exchanger were determined with all the tube
spacers removed from the tube bundle, except for
one horizontal and one vertical spacer at opposite
ends. In Figs. 7.2 and 7.3 the data are compared
with previous data taken with all the spacers in
the heat exchanger. As was to be expected, both
the heat transfer coefficients and the friction
factors decreased upon removal of the tube
spacers, The difference is partially due to the
spacers creating form drag and inducing some
_ additional turbulence, However, when the spacers

were removed, the tubes were not rigidly held, and

about the nature of the thermal structure in the

profiles exhibited large degrees of asymmetry;
(2) the wall temperatures fluctuated significantly

flow rates, were constant with time; and @) the

agreement with previous temperature calculations

no results were obtained on this mixture. It did
not have the turbid appearance characteristic of
other BeF_ mixtures but was clear, glassy, and
full of air bubbles. Its viscosity appeared to be
high.

The low viscosity values obtained for salt b
suggested the possibility that research with
systems containing RbF might produce a satis-
factory fuel with a viscosity lower than that of
the zirconium-base fuel now being considered for
the ART. Salt b, which is, approximately, a
prototype of the proposed ART fuel, with RbF
substituted for NaF, was therefore investigated.
It was found to have a kinematic viscosity about
20% lower than that of the corresponding NaF
mixture, Further research and the use of higher
purity RbF might produce fuels with even lower
viscosities.

The results of metallographic examination of the
fluoride-fuel loop recently operated in the LITR

horizontal beam hole are presented. Corrosion of
the Inconel tubing by the circulating-fuel mixture

“was found to ‘be low. The miniature in-pile loop
wads ‘operated for a short time in a vertical hole

of the LITR, but the experiment was terminated
because of difficulties caused by failure of the

"pump motor,” Modifications to be made in the loop
are descri bed.

‘Specimen “assemblies being prepared for stress

“as well as bench tests of an apparatus for creep
fests in the MTR. Flux measurements in the MTR

The previously described! loop in which fluoride
fuel was circulated in a horizontal beam hole
(HB-2) in the LITR was examined visually, metal-
lographically, and chemically for effects of the
irradiation. During operation of the loop the maxi-
mum fuel temperatures were 1450 to 1500°F; the
fuel Reynolds number was 4500 to 6200 or about
5000 for most of the operation; the power gener-
ation in the fuel was about 2.8 kw; the power
density was 0.4 kw/em?3; and the duration of oper-
ation was 645 hr, with the reactor at full power
(3 Mw) for 475 hr.

From flux measurements in the empty beam hole,
it was estimated that the power generated in the
loop should be considerably higher than the 2.8
kw obtained from heat balance measurements, and

therefore an additional experiment was carried

out to measure the flux depression in the fuel

duplicated the irradiated portion of the loop was
made up and was filled with a 2% Cd-98% Pb
alloy, which had the same macroscopic absorption
cross section as the fuel salt. This assembly
was inserted in a water-cooled jacket in hole
HB-2. The neutron activation of the cadmium-
lead alloy was measured, and the relation between
the activation and the neutron flux was established
by calibrating the data for the alloy with cobalt-
foil data. Because of uncertainty regarding the
position of the fluoride fuel loop in the hole, it
was not considered that this experiment gave a
reliable measurement of the flux; however, the
flux distribution found did agree with that cal-
culated from the heat balance data and that de-
termined subsequently from the cobalt foils that
monitored the fuel loop.

After disassembly of the loop in the hot cells,
a measurement of neutron flux was obtained from
the activity of cobalt monitor foils which were
at various points in a copper iube attached to
the nose of the loop. Since these foils were of
necessity outside the fuel tube, it was also neces-
sary to measure the activity of the Inconel fuel
tube. The neutron flux was calculated from the
data by using the relation, measured by Bopp,?
between the activity of the Inconel and the flux.
The neutron flux data obtained from the activities
of the cobalt foils and the Inconel are plotted
as functions of distance along the loop in Fig. 8.1.
The fission power calculated from the Inconel
activation was 2.8 kw, and the maximum power
density was 0.4 kw/cm3.

The fission power generated in the fuel was
also determined by measuring the activities of
fission products in the samples taken for chemical
analyses. The activity of the fuel was obtained
with a gamma-ray spectrometer, and the height
of the zirconium-niobium peak was compared with

that of a standard. The zirconium-niobium concen-

tration corresponded to a fission power of 2.0 kw.
The zirconium fission product and the cesium
fission product were also chemically separated

the end of the loop was about 0.4 kw/cm?.

The tube sections cut for chemical sampling
were taken from both the in-pile and out-of-pile
parts of the loop to ensure representative sampling.
Fuel samples were taken. from the ends of the
tube sections by drilling out solidified fuel with
carbide-tipped bits. Clean samples were obtained
by collecting only the borings from a small bit
after a large bit had been used to drill through
the surface material. Samples of fuel which had
been circulated during operation of the loop were
obtained in the same manner from the portion of
the loop filling line that was outside the pump
shield. The samples were’ analyzed for uranium,
zirconium, and the constituents of Inconel (nickel,
chromium, and iron). The results of the chemical
analyses are presented in Table 8.1. The nominal
Fompe sition of the original fuel was 25 mole %

4 (47 wt %), 62.5 mole % NaF, and 12.5 mole %

3 and the enrichment was about 93%. It can
be seen that the preliminary flushing with NaF-

ZrF for cleaning and testing diluted the uranium
content of the operating charge of the loop. The
analytical results show that the uranium concen-
tration remained unchanged during the run, that
the chromium content increased from corrosion
of the Inconel tubing, and that the nickel content

‘probably decreased during the course of the corro-

sion reactions. These changes in the concentra

The tube sections cut from the loop for metal-
lographic examination were cleaned of fuel to
facilitate polishing and etching. They were placed
vertically in an inert-atmosphere furnace and held
at a temperature above 750°C until the fuel had
completely drained from the tubes. Control specie
mens (pieces of as-received tubing cut from the
ends of the tubes used to fabricate the loop) were
examined for comparison with the samples from
the loop. The methods of examination and the

only section unheated during actual irradiation.
This section was in the outlet leg of the loop,
and it was maintained af about the temperature
of the rest of the loop by the molten salt. Samples
from this section of the loop showed the minimum
corrosion attack, the average penetration being
less than 0.5 mil. A sample that is typical of the
entire unirradiated part of the loop is shown in
Fig. 8.4; the specimen was taken from the inlet

leg of the loop within the LITR shield. The corro-

sion penetration averaged 0.5 mil, and the maximum
penetration was 1 mil.

The maximum corrosion in the loop was found
in the unirradiated portion of the outlet leg, Fig.
8.5, where the average penetration was 1 mil and
the maximum was 2.5 mils. The control specimen
taken from the unused end of the tubing in the
outlet leg of the loop is shown in Fig. 8.6. Surface
cracks on the inner surface of the tubing were
observed to be common in the control specimens.
The cracks were probably responsible for occa-
sional voids extending to depths of 3 or 4 mils
in the loop specimen. A specimen from the tip
of the irradiated loop nosepiece, which was closest
to the LITR lattice, is shown in Fig. 8.7. The
corrosion was about the same as the average
corrosion found elsewhere, without the occasional
deep voids shown in Fig. 8.5. The thick-walled

The miniature fluoride-fuel loop, described pre-
viously,® was operated in vertical position C-48
of the LITR. Because of faulty behavior of the
pump “motor, the fuel flow velocity could not be
maintained at a steady value, and the test was
incomplete as a corrosion study. It was possible,
however, to make a fairly thorough study of in-
pile characteristics of the loop, which operated
for a total of 30 hr at full power, with a fuel
Reynolds number of 3200 to 5000. The operation
throughout this period was complicated by inter-
mittent pump motor trouble, and the experiment
was terminated when the motor stopped completely.

The instruments controlled the temperature satis-
factorily to within +5°F and did not allow ex-
cessive excursions in temperature when the fuel
velocity changed rapidly. Several scram situations
occurred during the short run because of low pump
speed, high activity in the off-gas stream, and
a high temperature indication that resulted from
a thermocouple failure. All these situations were
adequately handled in time to prevent high-tempera-
ture excursions.

Three components of the loop were faulty: the
pump “motor, the pressure transmitters on the
venturi tube, and the header box in the off-gas
system. No complete explanation for the erratic
behavior of the motor can be given, as yet, but
it appears that the combination of high temperature
and very dry helium atmosphere caused brush
failure. An induction motor with a canned rotor

“will be used on the next loop.

“The pressure transmitters were unreliable, but
it does not appear that any changes which could
be made in a reasonable time would be of much

‘help. Therefore they are to be removed from the

system. Removal of the pressure cells will permit

“-“more of the loop to be lowered into the reactor.
This will increase the total power generation and

will place the ‘point of maximum temperature near

* the maximum neutron flux.

During the short irradiation of the first loop a

‘gasket was blown out of the off-gas header box

located at the face of the reactor. This allowed
some leakage of activity into the midriff area of
the LITR. The header box is to be redesigned to
withstand the full, available, air pressure without
leaking.

Since the flowmeter was inoperable, another
method of obtaining fuel velocities was devised.
The method used was to find the pressure de-
veloped at a given pump speed and to find the
change in pressure vs flow for the loop. These
values were measured by using water as the pumped
fluid in exact duplicates of the pump and the loop.
Figure 8.9 shows a plot of pump speed vs Reynolds
number of the fuel.

heater spaced between the fins is provided for
additional control of the specimen temperature,
The control thermocouple on the inside of the
specimen tube should give very nearly the maxi-
mum temperature of the system at any time. Heat
transfer calculations predict that the fuel will
freeze at the outer walls of the fuel chamber so
that the fuel will be contained in a cup of solid
fuel; thus the surface-to-volume ratio of the test
system will be considerably lowered. It does
not appear likely, at this time, that the tempera-
ture of the specimen can be maintained at the
control level during reactor shutdown periods;
however, fuels with a power density of 1000 w/cm?
are difficult to simulate in bench tests of this
type of experiment. The gas space above the
fuel is connected through a capillary tube to an
expansion chamber to decrease the back pressure
on the specimen walls when the specimen is
brought up to temperature. The first group of
specimen assemblies is now being filled with
fuel for tests in the LITR. Engineering of the
plug design to adapt the apparatus for insertion
in the MTR is under way.

A simplified version of the apparatus to pemit
creep data to be obtained in any combination of
two nonfuel atmospheres is undergoing bench
tests prior to irradiation. Measurements of the
total strain in the specimen tubes will be ac-
complished with a pneumatic measuring gage.
Inside-diameter measurements of the specimen tube
can be made with an accuracy of about 0.00005 in.
with the pneumatic gage, and the manipulative
operations are simple enough to be done in a hot
cell.

The operation of a number of pressure-reducing
valves, with pressure ranges from 200 to 1000 psi,
has been checked over a period of about a week.
Of the two valves presently being tested, one
appears to be capable of holding set pressures
to within 1% over the range of room temperatures
‘encountered in the laboratory.

CAI ratio pressure-volume transformer for iso-
lating the gas inside the specimen tube from the
pressure supply has been built and tested. Be
cause of the controlled, limited volume of gas
available to the specimen tube with this apparatus,
leakage or rupture results in only a very small
pressure rise in the whole apparatus. Protection

The MTR (tensile) creep test apparatus was
irradiated for two cycles in hole HB-3 of the MTR
at 1500°F and 1500 psi. For some unknown reason,
two of the four Bourdon tube extensometers did
not operate after insertion in the reactor. There-
fore total creep measurements and a determination
of the effects of radiation on the calibration fac-
tors of the Bourdon tube extensometers will be
made when the apparatus is returned to Oak Ridge.
The apparatus has been cut from the irradiation
plug at the MTR site. The bench test equivalent
of the in-pile rig in time, temperature, and stress
has been assembled and testing has started.

Neutron flux measurements have been in prog-
ress for some time in hole HB-3 of the MTR.10 A
schematic diagram of the location of the HB-3
beam hole in relation to the lattice is shown in
Fig. 8.12. High-energy flux data were obtained
because of a need to know the fast-neutron flux
intensity and distribution available for tests of
structural properties of ART materials, For such
tests to be realistic, both a high-energy flux and a
high, integrated fast-neutron dosage were required.
Thermal-neutron flux data were also obtained for
estimating power generation in uranium-bearing
fluoride fuel loops.

The results obtained include a crude spectral
analysis of the neutron energies in HB-3, made

as shown in Fig. 8.15, such a test would have to
be made in a limited region in the beam hole. The
magnitude of the maximum instantaneous fast-neu-
tron flux available, 3.1 x 10'3, is less than the
flux expected in the ART, 4 x 10'4, by about a
factor of 10 and misses some aircraft reactor de-
sign fluxes, for example, ~2 x 1015, by about a
factor of 70. Further analyses are being made in
order to substantiate or refute these fast-neutron
flux measurements.

A series of measurements of flux depression in a
mockup of a fluoride~fuel in-pile loop section as a
function of amount of fuel present, wall thickness
of the container, and position of the container were
made in order to serve as a basis for design of a
loop for operation in HB-3 of the MTR. The values
of effective thermal-neutron flux obtained from this
experiment were used to calculate the total power
generation and power density to be expected in
the loop.

The apparatus for the series of measurements
consisted of two major pieces. The outer piece
was an Inconel cylinder 7 in. in length and hol-
lowed to contain a solid-cylinder core of the neu-
tron absorber used to simulate the fuel. The core

three cores with the reactor operating at 5 Mw are

An operating power of 5 Mw, rather than the usual
30 Mw, was chosen because the gamma-ray heat
at 30 Mw would have raised the temperatures of
the cores to above their melting points. The ther-
mal-neutron flux as a function of power was ob-
tained at two positions, as shown in Fig. 8.17, so
that the flux-depression data obtained in the 5-Mw
runs could be scaled to 30 Mw. As may be seen,
the flux vs power curves are nonlinear between 20
and 30 Mw.

pected in the first MTR in-pile loop, 4 based on

perimental data for the beryllium chips indicate a
half life of 90 days, which agrees satisfactorily
with a listed'¢ value of 85 days. Both the gamma-
ray peaks and the energy sums indicate that the
gamma rays are in cascade, as they are shown in
the listed decay scheme.

Another beryllium sample, from the R, D. MacKay
Company, was analyzed in the same manner for
scandium and was found fo have about the same
amount present (Fig. 8.20), The beryllium-to-
scandium weight ratio for The Brush Beryllium Co.
sample, as measured by the gamma-ray scintillation
spectrometer and the MTR 477 high-pressure ioniza-
tion chamber, was 6.8 x 104. For the R. D. Mac-
Kay Co. sample, it was 7.1 x 104, Therefore, the
scandium present in both samples was below the
limit of chemical detection stated above.

| n-Butyl Bromide Method

The n-butyl bromide method! is the standard
method used in the ANP Analytical Chemistry
Laboratory for determining oxygen in sodium. The
original method has, however, been modified re-
cently by two laboratories.?® In the modified
procedures the organic reagents, n-butyl bromide
and hexane, are purified and dried by passing them
through a column packed with silica gel and dia-
tomaceous earth. The purified reagents are stored
over P,0,. A modification of the reaction tube
has alsh been recommended to reduce atmospheric
contamination. The modified method is reported
to be very sensitive and to be applicable to the
determination of oxygen in sodium in concen-
trations as low as 5 to 10 ppm. An evaluation of
these modifications was therefore undertaken pre-
paratory to incorporating them in the standard
procedure.

The reagents, hexane and n-butyl bromide, were
purified and dried by passing the liquids through

columns packed with silica gel and diatomaceous
earth; they retained about 10 ppm water. They
were then rendered anhydrous by desiccation with
activated ALLO, or P.O. The latter has the dis-
advantage that it reacts with the water in the
reagents to form acids which remain in the liquid
phase in sufficient concentration to cause low
results in the oxygen determination. Such an
error can become significant when the reagents .
are stored over P,0, for extended periods. Also, |
anhydrous reagents become contaminated with :
water when exposed to the atmosphere. Wet re- |
agents lead to high results in the oxygen determi- k
nation. CT

The n-butyl bromide procedure was further modi-
fied so that an atmosphere of argon was maintained
over the reagents and reaction mixtures at all
times. In addition, transfer of the reagents from oF
the storage vessel to the reactor tube was carried k
out by applying pressure with dry argon. The
modifications are illustrated in Fig. 9.1. Excel-
lent reproducibility was obtained in the determi-
nation of oxygen in sodium with the modified
apparatus when the samples were taken in glass
tubes. The oxygen content of the majority of the
samples received from ANP facilities was in
excess of 200 ppm. Much lower concentrations,
of the order of 20 to 40 ppm of oxygen, were found

borious purification.

The n-butyl bromide method was also used to
study the effect of precleaning glass sample tubes
prior to sampling. The interior of such sample
tubes was found to be effectively cleaned of

" oxygen-containing impurities by treating with

H,CrO, or by flushing with molten sodium. A
~ multibulb tube is required to accomplish the
cleaning action with sodium.

Vacuum-Distillation Method

A method is being tested for the determination
~ of oxygen in sodium by titration of the Na,O that
remains after vacuum distillation of the sodium
“metal. A distillation apparatus has been con-
structed that is similar to one developed by the
Argonne National Laboratory. * The vacuum-
distillation method of analysis is particularly
“suited to the sampling of sodium at operating
temperatures of the order of 1200°F and obviates
the necessity for precooling the sodium before
sampling. A schematic diagram of the equipment
is shown in Fig. 9.2.

The sample of molten sodium is introduced into
the evacuated apparatus through a heated transfer
line, which is maintained at the operating tempera-
ture of the system being tested. The metal flows
directly into a calibrated, hemispherical sample
cup, which is fitted with a thin, nickel liner. A
volume of sodium sufficient to flush the transfer
line and sample cup is first passed through the
apparatus. The excess sodium, which pours over
the edge of the sample cup, is discharged into

a glass reservoir in which the volume of the flush
sodium can be observed. With the pressure “of the

system maintained at less “than 10 p, the sample

is heated to 950°F, ‘and the metallic sodium is -

VOLUMETRIC DETERMINATION OF ZIRCONIUM
IN FLUORIDE SALTS WITH DISODIUM
DIHYDROGEN ETHYLENE-
DIAMINETETRAACETATE (EDTA)

A. S. Meyer, Jr. D. L. Manning
Analytical Chemistry Division

A volumetric method for the determination of
zirconium in mixtures of fluoride salts was de-
veloped. This method, which was outlined in the
previous report, was based on the work of Fritz
and Johnson. ®

The procedure consists in adding an excess of
EDTA to a sulfate solution containing zirconium
and titrating the excess with trivalent iron to a
Tiron  (disodium-1,2-dihydroxybenzene-3,5-disul-
fonate) end point at a pH of 4.8. The color change

at the end point is from yellow to purple. The-

method is applicable to the determination of zir-
conium in the presence of sulfate, tartrate, small
amounts of fluoride, and hexavalent uranium. The
yellow color of hexavalent uranium seriously
interferes with the bismuth-thiourea end point
proposed by Fritz and Johnson.$

There are relatively few cationic interferences,
because zirconium and iron form extremely stable
complexes with EDTA. In the back-titration with
trivalent iron the purple color of the iron-Tiron
complex is not obtained until the metal-EDTA
complexes, which are less stable than the iron
(I-EDTA complexes, have been dissociated.

...-Fluoride ion concentrations of up to about 0.1 M

do not appear to interfere with the titrimetric pro-

- cedure. Higher concentrations of fluoride ion can
be effectively reduced by adding beryllium to the

solution prior to the addition of the EDTA, The
interference is removed through the formation of
the stable BeF,~ = complex.

“With a slight modification in the experimental
pre cedure, the method is applicable to the determi-

 

“nation of zirconium in the presence of moderate

ordinarily interfere seriously with the zirconium
determination. The interference can be overcome

by “forming the EDTA complex of the zirconium

to the solution.’

procedure results in a considerable saving of time

dry box was measured as a function of time while
argon was being passed through the box at a
constant flow rate. Oxygen concentrations in

absorption of oxygen in pyrogallol. Lower concen-
trations were determined by a modification of the
Winkler technique in which a suspension of
Mn(OH), in an alkaline solution of Kl is equi-

agitated by means of a blower, the oxygen concen-
tration decreases exponentially with the volume
of sweep gas, in accordance with theoretical
prediction. The oxygen can be eliminated more
rapidly by introducing the more dense argon at
the bottom of a quiescent dry box. Helium, when
introduced at the top of the box, provides a some-

argon. ~ ‘

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

This method involves the reaction of a metal
oxide with bromine vapor, in the presence of
: “graphite, to form the metal bromide and CO. The
~ CO is then oxidized to CO, by reaction with hot
C0. The amount of CO evolved is a measure
of the oxygen “originally present in the sample.
The oppargtus for this analysis was described
a previously.’
© The primary objective of recent work has been
to find the “optimum conditions for the determi-
~~ nation’ of oxygen in ZrF,. The oxygen in this
EB salt is present as Z:0, for Z:OF, or, possibly,
= “both ‘compounds.
: attempt was made to analyze synthetic
mixtures of Zo, ond ZrF, by the bromination
~ method. “The recovery of oxygen, as CO,, was
ST incomplete in all cases. Analyses of samples of
: - pure Z:0, by the bromination method also resulted
in’ incomplete recovery of the theoretical amount
‘of oxygen.
©: Several experimental conditions were varied in
these investigations. The length of the platinum
"boats was changed from 1 to 3 in., and in some
experiments the sample was contained on a sheet
‘of platinum. The weight of ZrO, was varied from
<+3 to 50 mg, and the ratio of Z:0, to graphite was
varied from 1:2 to 1:20. In one axperiment, sugar
charcoal was substituted for the graphite.
“In these studies with Z0,,
) tained and the residual Z:0,, which remained in
“the reaction boat, were determined. The reaction
“involved in the initial step of the analysis is

ZO, + 28r, + X—>Zrbr, + 200

  

. Therefore, any ) 2:0, which did not react with the
bromine should be found in the boat. The amounts
co, obtained from these samples appeared to
oxceod the amount of oxygen actually removed
“from the Z:0,,. " This has been attributed, in part,
to “the presence of moisture in the graphite.
vs Furthermore, ‘the residual ZrO, found in the boat
"varied from 50 to 90% of the original sample
Ln weight for periods of bromination of up to 6 hr

both the co, ob-

of TiO, remaining in the platinum boat after a

2-hr period of bromination was determined in these
studies. Complete removal of the TiO,, as the
bromide, from the boat was achieved when the
oxide and graphite, approximately 15 mg each,
were mixed together with a mortar and pestle.

When the two materials were mixed by using a

spatula, quantative removal of TiO, from the
boat was not obtained; however, when 2 the mixing
was done with great care, up to 95% of a 10-mg
sample of TiO, could be removed as TiBr, in 2 hr.

The sample preparation described by Codell
and Norwitz® consists in placing titanium chips,
metal or alloy, between two layers of graphite.
In this case, it is probable that the volatilization
of the metal as a bromide would leave the re-
maining TiO, in intimate contact with the graphite,
without the need of external mixing. lt would also
be probable that, in the determination of the oxide
contamination of salts that are volatile at moderate
temperature, there would be no need for tedious
sample preparation. For a determination of oxygen
in a material containing greater than 1% oxide,
it would be advisable to ensure an intimate mixture
of the sample and graphite. The information
gained in the study of the bromination of TiO,
will be applied to the determination of oxygen in
ZrO, and other oxides of interest.

The formation of a precipitate on the surface
of the Ba(OH), bubbler, which was reported pre-
viously, ! was prevented by inserting a thin
platinum tube inside the ignition tube. It was
necessary to use this platinum tube only during
the analysis of samples containing fluorides. It

‘is believed that the contact of volatile fluoride

salts with the hot quartz of the ignition tube re-
sulted in the formation of SiF,. This gas reacted
with the solution of Ba(OH), to precipitate
BaSiF,. The platinum liner inserted in the ignition
tube prevented the formation of SiF ,.

Determination of co

Various methods for determining CO are being ~~

investigated. The purpose of these studies is to
find a sensitive method for a more direct measure
of the CO that is formed in the determination of
oxygen in metal oxides by bromination.

is of current interest. ' This method involves

the following reaction:

PdCi, +CO+H ,0—> Pd + CO, + 2HCI

Carbon monoxide is allowed to react with 0.01 meq
of PdCI, in 0.001 N" HCI; the solution also con-
tains MgCl, to flocculate the colloidal palladium
that is formed in the reaction. The net increase
in hydrogen ion concentration, determined by
titrating with a base and using an indicator of
bromophenol blue, is a measure of the CO that
was originally present. ‘In the present study, it
was necessary to use a greater amount of PdCl,
(1 nmieq) and to eliminate HCl in the preparation
of the reagent. Poiassiym chloride proved to be
an effective substitute for HCl in the dissolution
of PdCl,.

Titrations of synthetic mixtures of HCl and
PdCl, were performed to find suitable conditions
for a determination of HCl in such solutions.
Since solutions of PdCl, exhibit considerable
buffering action at a pH of 4.5, it was not possible
to determine HCl in a solution of PdCl,. Several
means of removing the palladium ion were investi-

gated, and the addition of Kl! was found to be

effective for this purpose. Excellent titration
curves were obtained when an amount of Kl, in
excess of the amount of PdCl,, was added to the
solution containing HCI and PdCl, prior to the
titration of HCI. The change in pH, during the
titration, wds observed by means of a pH meter,

‘and plots of pH against the ‘quantity of base added

were prepared from the data. These plots are
shown in n Fig. 9. 3. Subsequent studies “are planned

PILOT PLANT DESIGN

A project analysis will be completed soon that
will serve as a basis for establishing an accurate
schedule for design and construction of the pilot
plant for recovering fused-salt fuels, A new cost
estimate will also be made. Certain delays in
design and procurement make a construction coms
pletion date near the end of February 1956 more
realistic than the December 31, 1955, date previ-
ously planned.

An engineering flowsheet was issued that is
subject fo revisions as needed to stay abreast of
laboratory work. Approximately 65% of the proc-
ess equipment items are on hand or are in some
stage of procurement or fabrication,

The dump tank containing the ARE fuel was
moved uneventfully from Building 7503 to Cell 3,
Building +8019, on July 27, 1955. It is no longer
planned to force the molten fuel out of the dump
tank by nitrogen pressure. Instead, the dump tank
will be inverted inside a fumace liner, and the
fuel will drain out of the dump tank into the liner
and thence to a heated pressure vessel, where it
will be stored in the molten state until processed.
The molten fuel will be forced from the pressure
by nitrogen pre ssure,
Radioactive salts from sections of various in=
m-bearing s salts

 

 

      

Direct-resistance heating was tes ted, because of
its simplicity, as a means of preventing plugging
in the transfer lines between the fluorinator and

the ARE dump tank or the waste-salt receiver.
With Yein.-dia 0.035-in.~thick-wall Inconel trans
fer lines, a current of 75 amp was sufficient to
keep the salt molten, except at fittings, where
supplemental extemal heating was necessary, It
was recommended that such heating units be built
info the piping in the Fluoride-Volatility Process
Pilot Plant.

A freeze valve (Fig. 10.1) was designed for
closing the molten salt transfer lines leading to
and from the fluorinator, since no reliable mechani-
cal valve is available. The valve operates by the

freezing of a plug of salt in a vented trap in the
line. The salt outlet is barely visible behind the
downcomer in the photograph. Novel features of
the design are the provision for inert-gas blow-
back through the inlet pipe and the conical bottom
to minimize holdup within the valve and to lessen
the mechanical strain imposed by expansion of the
salt during melting, After 15 cycles of freezing
and thawing, this valve, when frozen, held against
“a test pressure of 20 psig without leaking.

The nature of gas dispersion through a percola-
tor type of gas-liquid contactor was studied, and
the liquid recirculation rate was measured as a
function of gas flow rate, gas inlet configuration,

“and percolator tube length, diameter, and sub-

mergence. The data are being analyzed for use in
designing a fluorinator for the fluoride-volatility
process.

© PROCESS DEVELOPMENT

An improved procedure for decontaminating the

 

UF, product of the fluorination step was de-
veloped (Fig. 10.2). The procedure is based upon
UF “absorption on NaF at 100°C and desorption
by heating to 400°C, with the product gas passing

through a second bed of NaF before collection of
the UF in a cold trap. The over-all gamma de-
contamination factors of greater than 10° that were
obtained are to be compared with the decontamina-
tion factors of only about 104 obtained with the
process in which a single bed at 650°C! or at
100 to 400°C was used. In the single-bed proc-
ess, cross contamination occurred because of the
use of the same lines for collecting the product
and for handling the waste gases containing small
amounts of fission products, and, as a result, the
decontamination factors are much lower in re-used
equipment than in new equipment. Since fission
products never enter the product-collection system
in the two-bed process, decontamination factors of
greater than 10° were obtained in re-used equip-
ment, Preliminary results indicated that the use
of nitrogen as a sweep gas in both the fluorination
and the NaF absorption and desorption steps re-
duced the amount of fluorine required for the
process.

18-in.-long bed of NaF was used. The UF, efflu-
ent from the fluorinator was passed through this
bed at 100°C, and then the flow was cut off while
the bed was heated to 400°C to desorb the UF.
As shown by analyses of the contents of the cold
trap after the absorption step and of the residual
NaF after the desorption step, 50 to 90% of the
volatile ruthenium passed through the NaF at
100°C, and more than 99% of the absorbed ruthe-
nium was not desorbed on heating to 400°C. Es-
sentially all the niobium was absorbed at 100°C
and was not desorbed at 400°C, which gives a
decontamination factor of about 10% for the absorp-
tion-desorption step. When new tubing and equip-
ment were used, the over-all decontamination fac-
tors for the single-bed process were about 104

(Table 10.1).

When the gas lines and equipment were re-used,

‘ruthenium that had been deposited in them in pre-

vious runs prevented good product decontamina-
tion, To avoid this contamination, two 9-in.-long
beds were tried. The UF, was absorbed in the
first NaF bed, the unabsorbed fission products

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1955

being collected in a cold trap. The line to the
cold trap was closed during the desorption step,
and the product stream was passed through the
second NaF bed for absorption of any fission prod-
ucts desorbed from the first bed or from the walls
of the lines between the first and second beds
(Fig. 10.2). In two test runs, UF, product con-
taining about the same beta and gamma activity as
natural uranium, or less, was obtained. The gross
beta or gamma decontamination factors for the
whole process were of the order of 105, Because
of the low product activity, calculation of the
various specific decontamination factors was not
practical, The effectiveness of the method, how-
ever, was shown by the distribution of activities in
the two NaF beds and the cold trap used in the
absorption step (Table 10.2).

A yield of only 40% was obtained in the two runs
because of poor temperature control of the 9«in.-
long beds. In two later runs, 6-in.-long beds with
better insulation and heating control gave yields
of 90 to 100% with the same high decontamination
factors of about 105, The same NaF was used in

the second run as in the first, and thus, for the
first time, it was established that activity can be
prevented from seriously contaminating the product
UF process lines. Since the NaF/U weight ratio
in each run was 4, the over-all ratio after the
second run was 2,

The uranium loss in the cold trap used in the
absorption operation at 100°C varied from less
than 0.001 to 0.04% in the four runs with the two
beds. Less than 0.1% of the total uranium proc.
essed was found in the NaF in the two runs with
the use of the same NaF beds.

In the last two runs, an equal-volume mixture of
fluorine and nitrogen was used for the fluorination
until about 75% of the uranium had been volati-
lized, pure fluorine being used to remove the last
of the uranium from the molten salt, The induction
period observed previously? was eliminated, and
uranium losses in the waste salt were only 0.013

182

and 0.004% with F,/U mole ratios of 3.7 and 5,
respectively, The over-all F,/U mole ratios, in-
cluding the fluorine used for desorbing UF, from
the NaF, were 5.6 and 6.7, which are somewhat
lower than the ratio of 9 used in previous! NaF
decontamination studies.

Preliminary results also indicated that nitrogen
can be used to replace part of the fluorine used in
the NaF desorption step. A 10-g charge of 12- to
40-mesh NaF in a Yin.-dia nickel tube at 100°C
was saturated with about 9.5 g of UF, and then
raised to 400°C for approximately 30 min to desorb
the UF, while nitrogen was being passed through
the tube at a rate of 200 ml/min. In two trials,
approximately 80% of the UF, was removed. This
method has not yet been used with activity present,

A survey of spherically symmetric unit shields
for circulating-fuel reactors was made, and weight
estimates for unit shields with various dose rates
at 50 ft are presented. The chief sources of radia-
tion in a 300-Mw circulating-fuel reactor for the
NJ-1 power plant were determined. A parametric
weight study of the shield weight dependence on
the dimensions of a 300-Mw circulating-fuel reactor
is described.

WEIGHTS OF SPHERICALLY SYMMETRIC UNIT
SHIELDS FOR CIRCULATING-FUEL REACTORS

A survey of spherically symmetric unit shields
for circulating-fuel reactors was made for a range
in dose rate of 0.1 to 10 rem/hr at a distance of 50
ft and a range in reactor power of 100 to 300 Mw.
An estimate was obtained for the added weight of
an NaK-to-NaK secondary heat exchanger and its
shielding. This additional weight is quite sensi-
tive to the manner in which the dose rate is divided
between the secondary heat exchanger and the
reactor and fo the absolute value for the sodium
activation. Consequently, the estimates must be
interpreted as indicating trends rather than absolute
values,

The reactor dimensions for this survey were
scaled from those given previously! for a 300-Mw
reactor having a power density of 2,75 kw/ cm? ,

“and the secondary heat exchanger dimensions were

fluxes measured behind a circulating-fuel reactor
mockup in the Lid Tank Shielding Facility (L TSF).
This mockup contained 4.5 in. of lead and 2%
boron in the water. As yet, the thermal-neutron
fluxes cannot be calculated for the reactor in this
region. Also, the degree of boration to be used
has not yet been determined. Consequently, the
capture data for the lead and alkylbenzene are
based on the assumption that the fraction of the
neutrons captured in the LTSF mockup applies to
the reactor, corrected only for neutron self-shielding
in the core,

SHIELD WEIGHT DEPENDENCE ON
THE DIMENSIONS OF A 300-Mw
CIRCULATING-FUEL REACTOR

A parametric weight study that is nearing com-
pletion indicates that lighter shield weights for
circulating-fuel reactors may result from changes
in reactor dimensions. The shield weights are
being determined for a fixed reactor power (300
Mw) and a ‘‘standard shield” (described below)
as a function of power density, island radius,
reflector thickness, and heat exchanger thickness.
The weights obtained will be used as part of the
input information in a parametric performance
study under way of Pratt & Whitney Aircraft,

The standard shield consists of a set of specifi-
cations sufficiently representative of tactical
bomber shields to ensure a realistic reactor op-
timization. Some concessions to expediency were
made, such as the selection of sea-level altitude
and a reactor-fo-crew-compartment separation
distance of 64 ft, in order to make direct use of

the neutron data recently obtained at the Tower

Shielding Facility (TSF).

regions, the various dose-rate components were
treated separately to account for the different
attenuation characteristics in the shielding ma-
terials. In considering air scattering, the dose
rate from neutron captures near the outer lead
surface was treated as a separate isotropic source
that was relatively independent of lead thickness.

A second difference arises from the use of TSF
fast-neutron experimental data for air scattering
and crew-compartment penetration and the use
of an optimized shape for the neutron reactor
shield and the crew-compartment wall thickness.
A third difference arises from the use of a tapered

shadow shield.

For these calculations, the crew compartment
was assumed to be a right cylinder, with an area
of 35 ft? on the rear and 225 £12 on the sides.
Plastic and lead were the shield materials used
to give a neutron dose rate of 0.25 rem/hr and a
gamma-ray dose rate of 0.75 rem/hr in the crew
compartment at sea level. The reactor-to-crew-
compartment separation distance used was 64 fi.
The reactor shield, which consisted of lead and
alkylbenzene (330°F), was designed to give a
maximum dose rate of 1000 rep/hr at 50 ft (as-
sumed radiation damage restriction).

The neutron shield was chosen in the following
manner, For a typical aircraft reactor (Table
11.2), the fast-neutron dose rate as a function
of the thickness of the spherical shield was ob-
tained by the application of conventional meth-
ods®+? to data from the current LTSF circulating-
fuel-reactor shielding tests (see Sec. 12, ‘‘Lid
Tank Shielding Facility’’), For this reactor and

the plastic thickness at the rear of the crew com-
partment was 43 cm and at the side, 14 cm. Be-
cause the neutron shielding on the crew compart-
ment was unchanged throughout the parameter
study, the fast-neutron dose rate at 64 fi from
the reactor at the various values of the reactor
angle 0 (where 0 is the angle measured with re-
spect to the reactor-to-crew-compartment axis)
~ also remained unchanged. A parameter change
in the reactor that resulted in a change in the
fast-neutron dose rate at any angle 6 was com-
pensated for by an adjustment of the neutron
shielding at that angle 0 to keep the fast-neutron
dose rate at 64 ft constant. In the TSF calcula-
tions, the angular distribution of the neutrons
escaping from the reactor shield surface was
assumed to be cos® ¥ in calculating the direct
dose, where ¥ is the angle measured with respect
to the normal to the shield surface, while radial
emission was assumed for the calculation of the
scattered dose.

With the neutron shielding fixed, the gamma-ray
shielding was taken to consist of four components:
the basic lead shield required to maintain a maxi-
mum dose rate of 1000 rep/hr at 50 ft (an arbitrary
radiation damage limitation); the shaped lead
shadow shield adjacent to the basic shield; the
lead on the side and front of the crew compart-
ment; and the lead on the rear of the crew com-
partment. The shadow shield was arbitrarily
shaped to permit the dose emission per unit
angle 6 to increase exponentially to compensate
for the exponential decrease in the probability
of scattered radiation penetrating the crew-
compartment side'® as 6 increased. An approxi-
mation for the effect of the angular distribution
‘of the gamma rays escaping from the reactor
shield surface was made by assuming a ‘‘dis-
: advantage angle’ ’ a (assumed to be 15 deg) when
calculating the scattered radiation penetrating
the crew compartment. This assumption results
in a constant thickness portion of the shadow
“shield that subtends a half-angle of 15deg with
respect fo the reactor-to-crew-compartment axis,

followed by a tapered section that decreases

The scattering-penetration probabilities used were
on calculated by NDA; Report of the 1953 Summer

linearly in thickness, with the angle 6, until it
reaches zero. The tapered section ends at 0 = 63
deg for a 3.23-in, shadow shield shaped with a
12.5-deg relaxation angle and a 2.1-cm relaxation
length in lead for the primary dose. The basic
lead shield does not have a constant thickness
but decreases from rear to front to compensate
for the increased gamma-ray attenuation from the
increasing neutron shield thickness along a radial
path,

The gamma-ray shield division chosen, under
the ‘assumptions outlined above, consisted of
0.1 in. of lead on the crew-compartment sides
and approximately 6 in. of lead, in addition to
the basic shield for the direct dose, which was
divided into a 2.56-in. shield on the crew-compart-
ment rear and a 3.23-in,-thick tapered shadow
shield near the center; the exact division of the
basic shield was not sensitive with respect to
weight, The shadow shield was in direct con-
tact with lead in most of the cases considered.

. Spacing was. employed, however, for some cases

in which the reflector was thin and for which the
secondary gamma-ray dose contribution was large.

The first step in the weight calculations was
to determine the shield necessary to give the
design dose rates from the rear of the shaped
reactor shield. The design dose rates were
108 rem/hr at 50 ft for fast neutrons (10.8 rep/hr)
and 1000 rem/hr at 50 ft for gamma rays (1000
rep/hr).

Neutron Shield

The neutron-attenuation data were taken from
fast-neutron dose-rate curves obtained at the
LTSF by using the Glass-Hurst fast-neutron
dosimeters and the Hornyak button, The data
were extrapolated for thicknesses beyond the
range of the LTSF fast-neutron dose-rate instru-
ments by means of thermal-neutron-flux traverses
in the LTSF and fast-neutron dose-rate measure-
ments at the TSF, Neutron dose-rate curves were
available for beryllium reflector moderator regions
8, 12, and 16 in. thick and a 4-in.-thick heat ex-
changer region; the data were corrected for air
gaps, aluminum tank walls, and Boral regions.
The basic neutron-shield thickness was determined

Gamma-Ray Shield

‘The gamma-ray shield was determined by finding,
separately, the gamma-ray dose rate at 50 ft caused
by (1) gamma rays emitted by the fuel in the core
and by neutron captures in the outer core shell and
in the reflector, (2) gamma rays emitted by fission
products in the heat exchanger, and (3) neutron
captures near the lead-alkylbenzene interface. For
each reactor shield design these three groups of
contributions were determined separately and then

summed.

Reactor Gamma-Ray Dose Rate. Dose-rate com-

“ponents of the LTSF data were available for several

lead thicknesses for each reflector thickness (8,
12, and 16 in.). The gamma-ray dose rate data
were divided into contributions from the source
plate, capture gamma rays from the beryllium re-
flector, capture gamma rays from the Inconel core

shell, and secondary gamma rays, principally from
“neutron captures in the lead, boron, and water near

the lead-water interface. The source correction
was determined by assuming an exponential power

In the natural uranium of the source plate, three-

in U238 and give radiative capture gamma rays
that are not present in the enriched reactor. Un-
fortunately, the energies and associated probabili-
ties of emission per capture for these gamma rays
are not known. For this study, a total energy of
6.4 Mev per U238 capture was assumed to be
emitted in a distribution corresponding to the
fission gamma-ray distribution, Similarly, for
radiative capture in U235, a total energy in gamma

be: :

The total scaling factor to be applied to the core
source for the same power per unit area of source

The scaling factor for the capture gamma rays
from the reflector was obtained as the ratio of the
fraction of neutrons captured in that region in the
reactor (as determined by application of Eyewash
code neutron cross section fo Foxcode multigroup
fluxes) to the fraction of neutrons captured in the
same region in the LTSF mockup (as determined .

measurements). This ratio was 0.0592/0.0145 or
4.00. The contribution from the island was calcu-
lated to increase this to 4.05.

The fraction of neutrons captured in the Inconel
core shell in the reactor was estimated in the same
manner as that from the reflector and was checked
against foil data from the Critical Experiment
Facility. The fraction captured in the LTSF mock-
up was also determined by integration of gold-foil
measurements. The scaling factor for the outer
core shell contribution is the ratio 0.0545/0.0161
or 3.39. Similar corrections applied to the inner
core shell raised the scaling factor for the core
shells to 3.62.

For each reflector thickness (8, 12, and 16 in.)
and for each lead thickness (3, 4.5, and 6 in.),
these correction factors were applied to the com-
ponents determined from the LTSF data. The

‘variation of the reflector component of the total

gamma-ray dose rate with reflector thickness, as
obtained from the LTSF data, was observed to be
in agreement with the variation for a reactor, as
determined in PWA-NDA multigroup calculations,
and therefore it was assumed that nonc of the
scaling factors changed with reflector thickness.

The sum of the dose-rate contributions from the
source plate, the capture gamma rays from the
beryllium reflector, and the capture gamma rays
from the Inconel core shell, that is, Dp, (4,2),

dose rate was the same as that for an equivalent
thickness of beryllium. Although the 2-in.-thick
layer of copper would not be sufficient to effect
an appreciable weight saving, there might be
enough self-absorption of capture gamma rays in a
4-in.-thick layer to show a valuable weight saving.

The effect on the total gamma-ray dose rate of
varying the beryllium thickness (8, 12, and 16 in.)
was not appreciable. There was greater attenuc-
tion of the source gamma rays by the larger berylli-
um thicknesses, but more capture gamma rays
resulted from the beryllium, Fast-neutron dose
rates were not very different behind the various
thicknesses,

A study of the effects of distributing the lead
gamma-ray shield in borated water was also made
in order to obtain the information needed for an
optimization of the placement of the lead, This
study showed that there would probably be no
weight saving as a result of distributing the lead
rather than placing it in one piece, for lead thick-
nesses up to 5 in., but that there might be an ap-
preciable weight saving as a result of distributing
the lead beyond the first 5-in, layer. The secondary
gamma-ray dose rate produced in the lead and
borated-water shield fell off at the same.rate as
the thermal-neutron flux and thus was apparently

"caused by thermal-neutron captures in the shield.

~~ Sodium Activation in the Heat
Exchanger Region of the Mockups

“Sodium activation tests were performed to de-
“termine the activation of the coolant in the heat

exchanger region as a function of the heat ex-
changer thickness, the boron curtain thickness and

distribution, and the reflector thickness. The ef-
fect on_ the activation of placing a copper gamma-

straight line was drawn through the two points

because of the lack of more information, Addi-

tional information probably would show these
curves to be slightly concave downward, as in the

198

cases where three heat exchanger tanks were used.
The five tests shown in Fig. 12.1 are representa-
tive of the results obtained to date, A more com-
plete analysis of all tests is being prepared,

If test 2 is used as a reference, comparison of
the activations in the different tests shows the
effect of adding or removing different components
of the configuration, In tests 1 through 4, 8 in. of
beryllium was used to simulate the reflector,
while in test 5, 12 in. of beryllium was used.

Comparing test 1 (4-in.-thick exchanger) with
test 2 (6-in.-thick heat exchanger) shows that
there is greater relative activation in test 2; this
results from the reduced resonance-neutron escape
probability in the thicker heat exchanger, The
escape probability may be increased simply by
distributing the boron curtain through the heat’
exchanger region. In test 4, a distributed curtain
containing less curtain material reduced the total
activation to about 25% below that found in test 2.

An increase in the reflector thickness from 8 in.
(test 2) to 12 in. (test 5) effected a decrease in
the sodium activation of about 80%. This was due
to two effects: an inverse-square spreading and a
reduction by the extra 4 in, of beryllium of the
number of neutrons at and slightly above the sodium
resonance energy of 3 kev,

In test 3, a gamma-ray shield of copper was
placed between the beryllium reflector and the first
boron curtain. The sodium activation was increased
by a factor of roughly 6, in comparison with the
activation found in test 1 with no copper present
in the reflector, The copper apparently changes
the fast-neutron spectrum so that there are relatively
more neutrons at or just above the 3-kev resonance
level of sodium. The boron curtain is only gray to
neutrons of this energy, and, hence, some of these
neutrons diffuse through the boron curtain into the
heat exchanger, where they are slowed down to the
3-kev resonance level by the fluorine.

This background is expected to result in a broader
angular distribution than actually exists.

The arrangement, in the pool, of the air collima-
tor, the fast-neutron detector, and the lead detec-
tor housing, relative to the reactor, is shown in
Fig. 13.1. The active lattice of the reactor is a

lattice. The air collimator is a hollow cylindrical
aluminum tube 168 cm long, 5.08 cm ID, with a

mator toward the reactor is given by coordinates
{(z,x), and the collimator angle, with respect to
the reactor center line, is designated by the angle
a, as shown in Fig. 13.1. Measurements were
taken only in a horizontal plane at the mid-plane
of the reactor.

instrumentation described previously,3 especially
constructed timing devices, and the fast pneumatic
probe assembly designed by E. C. Campbell.
Small, enriched-uranium samples that weighed

about 7 mg were irradiated in the ORNL Graphite
Reactor for times ranging from 1 to 8 sec, From

10 to 50 samples were required to obtain a single
decay curve, Each sample was withdrawn pneu-

‘matically in about 0.4 sec and stopped, automati-

cally, in front of a 10-in. lead collimator that led

to the multiple-crystal spectrometer. For this
application the lead spectrometer shield was sup-

plemented by a 1-ft-thick layer of LiF and paraffin

in order to reduce the neutron-induced gamma-ray

background. This shield makes the background
counting rate entirely negligible.
The electronic instruments associated with the

multiple-crystal spectrometer were arranged so
Ln that the counting rate ‘associated with a predeter-
“mined photon energy interval was available at any

given time after fission. A time analyzer recorded
this counting rate as a function of time in 40 time

"channels. These time channels were larger for

the longer times after fission so that the number of
counts received in the various time channels
would not vary too widely. [n the phase of the
experiment discussed here, the first time channel
was about 1.6 sec wide, and the last was about
10 sec wide,

Photon energy calibrations were made by using
Hg203, Na22, Zn63, F20, 790m ThC’’, and N16
sources. Calibrations of the time analyzer were
obtained by using a 60-cycle pulser.

The efficiency of the spectrometer as a function
of energy must be known in order to interpret the
data in terms of photons per second leaving the
uranium sample. In the energy region up to 1.3
Mev, the efficiency was determined by using the
absolute source strength of Hg293, Na22, Cs137,
Nb?3, and Zn8% calibration sources. These abso-
lute source strengths were obtained with the cali-

brated high-pressure ion chamber of the ORNL

Radioisotopes Control Laboratory.

THe=%Gnalysis of the data was straightforward,
except for the problems of absolute efficiency of

fissions occurring in the samples. For this ‘pre-
liminary analysis, large uncertainties were per-

“mitted in these two factors.

Although the efficiencies at energies up to

"1.3 Mev were measured for this analysis, the

efficiencies at higher energies were found largely
by comparison with previously obtained perform-

“ance data. It is therefore to be assumed that a

further analysis of these data would give a slightly

different result. A further difficulty arises from
the wide variation of the spectrometer efficiency

within a single energy group. The average effi-
ciency was used here, but the spectrum shape
within a given energy group should be used to

obtain a ‘weighted average efficiency.

   

The absolute norm of the results de-
pends upon the number of fissions in the samples,
which, in tum, depends upon several doubtful
quantities. For the l-sec bombardments, the time
spent by the samples in the reactor is in doubt by
at least 10%. The thermal flux and the macro-
scopic cross sections of the samples are also in
doubt. The effective thermal flux available to the
sample was measured by using gold foils and a
cadmium-difference technique. Thermal cross
sections were used for both the gold and y23s,

The basic results of the data analysis are shown
in Fig. 13.5. Six energy groups were studied, but
the region between 1.6 and 2.3 Mev was studied
with both the Compton (two-crystal) and pair
(three-crystal) spectrometers. It was expected
that these curves might not agree in a preliminary
analysis, because it is in the region studied that
the efficiencies of either type of spectrometer vary
most rapidly with photon energy. The times after

 

fission were measured from the center of the irra-

diation time interval, In the pair spectrometer

runs, it was necessary fo use an irradiation time

of 8 sec, and therefore saturation effects prejudice

In a previous report! an analysis of the fast-
neutron measurements of the differential shielding
experiment at the TSF was presented. In this
analysis the probability of the air scattering of
i neutrons into the various sides of the crew-
compartment shield was obtained as a function
of the angle 9 which a fast-neutron beam from the
reactor shield surface makes with respect to the
axis joining the reactor and the crew compartment,
"It also gave the probability of neutron penetration
through the shield into the crew compartment as a
function of 8. These probabilities have now been
used in the development of a procedure for opti-
ad mizing the neutron shielding of a divided shield
for an aircraft,

A further investigation of the GE-ANP reactor
and crew shield mockups was alsc made. Measure-
ments of gamma-ray doses inside the crew-
i compartment mockup were completed, and, at
present, a study of the distributions of gamma-ray
intensities around the reactor shield is being made.

the reactor, heat exchanger, gamma shield, etc.,
and thus the outer radius is the ‘sum of radius a
and the neutron shield thickness T , The crew
shield is assumed to have a rear thickness T, and
a side thickness T_, For simplicity, and because
of the small sacrifice in shield weight involved,
the front thickness T,i is taken to be equal to the
side thickness T _,

The procedure consists, first, in expressing both
the total weight of the neutron shield and the
dose rate at the center of the crew compartment
as functions of T , T,, and T; second, of using
the method of Lagrange multipliers to obtain the
equations which T , T , and T_ must satisfy in
order that the weight be a minimum for a specified
total dose rate; and third, of developing an iterative
procedure for the solution of these equations.

Calculation of Dose Rate

where A, the direct-beam relaxation length, is a

An expression similar to Eq. 9 holds for the
contribution to the dose rate at the center of

where A”, which is d function of §,, T , and vy (dy

partment, The factor {7 accounts for a decrease
in the dose rate at the center of the crew compart-
ment caused by the angular distribution of the
neutrons leaving the inside surface of the shield
at the rear of the crew compartment.

Finally, the dose entering as a direct beam from
the reactor through the rear of the crew compart-
ment shield must be considered. Let the angular
distribution of dose from an element of area at
the surface of the reactor shield be of the form
cos™ is, where iy denotes the angle between the
normal to the surface element and a given direction.
If it is assumed that the separation distance be-
tween the reactor and crew shield is large com-
pared with the outer radius of the reactor shield
and that the nth conical shell is in the hemisphere
toward the crew compartment, it may be shown
that the contribution of the nth shell to the direct-

Equation 21 gives { in terms of quantities which
are either specified or determined from the previous

estimates can be made of the values of the quan-
tities in Eq. 21. Since pérear << Dy pq) and
A/G ~ 1, X; will be approximately equal to 1.
Also, dW, . ./0T, is a constant and dW, , \/dT
varies only slowly with T_ for a reasonable crew-
compartment size. The relaxation lengths AS and
Al can be chosen to be equal to some average
values from the TSF data to within about 25%
accuracy. Hence, in the first iteration, a reason-
ably good estimate of { is obtained.

Step b. Equation 17 divided by Eq. 16 and com-
bined with the condition L, = £, gives a relation-
ship between T, and T_ that involves appropri-
ately averaged relaxation lengths and three basic
parameters. One parameter involves the relative
rate of shield weight change with respect to the
rear of the side shield thicknesses at the crew
compartment. The second parameter is the ratio
of the total air-scattered dose info the rear to that
into the side of the crew compartment, The third
parameter is closely related to the ratio of the
total direct-beam dose at the rear to the total air-
scattered dose at the side of the crew compartment.

In detail, the relationship discussed above is
obtained in the following manner. If Eq. 17 is
divided by Eq. 16 and the definitions for AS and A

Equation 25 relates T, and T in terms of the
various averaged relaxation lengths and the three
parameters whose physical significances are dis-
cussed above, The first parameter discussed above
is the quantity a in Eq. 25. The second parame-
ter is the left bracketed term af the right side
of Eq. 25, and the third parameter is the right
bracketed term, In a given iteration the parameters
and averaged relaxation lengths are evaluated on
the basis of the information obtained in the pre-
vious iteration. In the first iteration, As is taken
to be the same constant as that used “for As in
Step a, etc. Also, for the first iteration, “the
reactor shield is taken to be of an unspecified
uniform thickness (T, = a constant for all »), in
which case the bracketed terms in Eq. 25 reduce to

satisfy in the vicinity of the solution to obtain
equal values of U. For convenience, this relation-

In Eq. 27, L, is set equal to L, as previously de-
termined in Step a, Eq. 21. By using the values
of MA that are consistent with the results of the
previous iteration, the right side of Eq. 27 is cal-
culated for each n (n = 1, 2, ..., N) for various
assigned values of T_, From a plot of the left
side of Eq. 27 vs T, the values of T, correspond-
ingto each assigned value of T_ are then obtained.
Hence, plots can be made of T, vs T for each 7.

Step d. For various assumed values of T , values
of T are obtained from the plots made in Step c.
These values are then inserted into Eq. 16, with
use being made of Eq. 9 and the definitions given
by Eq. 23 to compute the £, for each T.. A plot is
then made of L, vs T_. The value of T_ for
which the corresponding C is equal to the value
of determined in Step a, Eq. 21, is the required
T_ for. the given iteration, The corresponding
values of the T and T,’s, for the given iteration,
are then obtained from the plots made in Steps b
and c¢. By using the above-described procedure,
the various shield thicknesses T , T , and T, for
n=1,2, «s., Nare determined in a given iteration.
The entire procedure is repeated for the following
iteration, and the iterations are continued until
convergence is obtained.

the extension was “guided by qualitative theoretical
considerations of the attenuation processes in-

ously, the air-scattering probabilities in Figs. 14.2
and 14.3 apply only for fast-neutrons filtered
through 45 cm of water at the reactor shield, that

is, for T, = 45 em. However, limited data obtained

for T= 15 cm (for which the fast-neutron spectrum
is expected to be quite different from that for
T, = 45 cm) indicate that the effect of the spectrum

shift is relatively small. Hence, the air-scattering
probabilities plotted in Figs. 14.2 and 14.3 were
taken, in the present calculations, to be inde-
pendent of the energy spectrum of the neutrons
emanating from the reactor shield (that is, inde-
pendent of T ). Also, values of {2ps_ (6) were
measured only in the range of angles, 8 = 90 to
180 deg, wherein the direct-beam dose at the rear
of the simulated crew compartment was small com-
pared with the air-scattered dose. The values of
12ps_ (6) in Fig. 14.3 are extrapolated values in
the range of angles from 0 to 90 deg, the extrapola-
tion being guided by the variation of 12ps RE!
measured for this range of angles.

The TSF measurements show that the relaxation
length for the direct-beam fast-neutron dose is a
function of the total water thickness between the
reactor and the dose detector at the rear of the
crew compartment; that is, the relaxation length
is independent of whether the water is at the
reactor or at the rear of the crew compartment.
A plot of the direct-beam relaxation length vs the
total water thickness is given in Fig. 14.4, and
from this plot the direct-beam relaxation length,
A, at any point in the reactor water shield can be
obtained. In addition, this plot gives the direct-
beam relaxation length A} at the water shield at

the plot is the shell thickness, T,, plus the dis-
tance in the water at the rear of the crew-compart-

desired, If plastic, instead of water, is used as the
crew-compartment shielding material, the values
of A} taken from Fig. 14.4 should be divided by
1.14 (based on removal cross sections).

In the TSF experiments, the scattered-dose re-
laxation lengths, AY, at the side of the crew-com-
partment shield were obtained as functions of
water thickness at the side for various values of
the angle 6. In these measurements, the fast
neutrons were filtered through 45 cm of water at
the reactor, that is, T, = 45 cm. Plots of A3(45,x)
vs x for various angles @ are presented in Fig.
14.5, where AS(45,x) is the AJ measured at water
thickness x into the side of the crew-compartment
shield for fast neutrons filtered through 45 cm of
water (T, = 45 cm). For the neutron shield calcu-
lations, it is necessary to know the variation of
A; with reactor shield thickness, 7, . A limited
amount of data obtained for T= 15 cm, when
compared with the data for T= 45 cm, indicates
that AS varies with Tin the same ratio as does
the direct-beam relaxation length, A, This re-
lationship is reasonable in view of the small

neutron energy degradation that results from a
neutron collision with air nuclei. The results of
some dose measurements at the center of a crew-

compartment mockup at 8 = 90 deg further indicate

the general validity of this relation. For a total
neutron attenuation through the crew-compartment
side shield of the order of >, the neutron attenua-

tion calculated for T, =15 cm, on the basis of the

foregoing relationship, and the AS values for T, =45
cm checked with the measured attenuation to within
30%. Hence, the foregoing relationship, written in
equation form,

measured for T_ = 45 cm over a range of values
of 9 from 90 to 180 deg. The A] values were es-
sentially constant over the measured range of 0
and T,. At the mid-point of the measured range
of T, which was approximately 15 cm, the AL
value was 7.0 cm. It was assumed in the calcu-
lations “that this A] value also applied in the
range 6 = 0 to 90 deg. In the same manner as
described for AL the effect of T, on Al was ac-
counted for by the relationship

For plastic instead of water at the crew shield,
both AY and Al would be corrected in the same
manner as described for AJ.

An important limitation exists, however, in the use
of the air-scattering probabilities and relaxation
lengths presented here. In the TSF experiments,
scattered-dose measurements were not taken for
ToorT, smaller than about 5 cm of water. Hence,
“to obtain the dose for T or T, less than 5 cm,
the data were extrapolated to T, =0orT, =0.
The values of 12Ps_ ol and £2ps (6), as well

as” the relaxation Tengths AS and 5 for T_ or

rs

less than 5 cm are, hence, extrapolated values.

For T and T, greater than 5 cm, the use of the

plots, of course, leads to correct results (within
the limitations previously discussed). However,
for T_ and T, less than 5 cm, the plots are only
as reliable as the extrapolation. Indications are
that for T_or T less than 5 cm, the relaxation
lengths AS and A? change appreciably; hence it
does not appear advisable to use the plots for

crew shield thicknesses less than 5 ecm of water.

The concept of the focusing factor f5 and the
method of interpretation of the TSF experiments

to obtain an experimental value of {3 were dis-

cussed previously by J. E. Van Hoomissen.® Van
Hoomissen obtained an average value of [$ of

5.3 over the range of angle ¢ from 0 to 180 deg;

the variation of fs with 6 was small and well
within the statistical accuracy of the data. Com-
parison with the analytical results of Faulkner?
indicates that the angular distribution of the dose
at the inside surface of the crew-compartment side
shield is approximately cos. In the TSF experi-
ments from which the value of f7 of 5.3 was ob-
tained, the side shield thickness for the crew-
compartment mockup was about 38 cm of water.
Inasmuch as the angular distribution of the dose
at the inside surface of the crew-compartment
sides would be expected to vary with side shield
thickness, the focusing factor /% is also expected
to vary “With side shield thickness; however,
Faulkner's results show that f° is not very sen-
sitive to angular distribution (7 is 4.0 for cos
distribution and 6.5 for cos® di stribution). In
the calculations, f$ was taken to be constant at
5.3. This value of /7 should be well within 25%
of the correct value, at least for side shield thick-
nesses greater than about two relaxation lengths
wherein the extremely slanted neutrons are atten-
uated.

To obtain the geometrical attenuation factors

fr and f7, the angular distribution of dose at the

inside surface of the grew-compartment rear shield

was taken to be cos? for the scattered dose and

cos® for the direct-beam dose. Integration over
the inside surface of the crew-compartment cir-
cular rear shield for the dose at the center of the

assumed to be equal to diameter) gives fI = 0.35
and /7 = 0.50.

The angular distribution of the fast-neutron dose
emanating from the reactor primary shield surface
was taken, inthe calculations, to be given by
the function cos® ¢(m = 5 in Eq. 11). Prelimi-
nary calculations indicate that the change in
shield thickness distribution would be small if a
more peaked distribution, cos? i, were used in
the calculations.

"From the table it may be seen that the iterative
procedure results in a reasonably rapid conver-
gence of the L's toward a constant value. A
better choice for the average relaxation lengths
used in the first iteration would have led, of

"course, to a much more rapid agreement between

the C's. The average relaxation lengths used
in the first iteration were A] = 5.3 cm, AD = 6.0
cm, and A’ = 8.5 cm. The results of the third

“iteration indicate that the correct averages are
Spproimately AS = 43 em, A] = 54 cm, and

- 87 cm. A fourth iteration would bring the

oF s into still closer agreement; however, the
“weight would not be affected appreciably. Also,

the input data are not sufficiently accurate to

give real meaning to the small changes in the

 

2

 

thicknesses which would be required to give
exact agreement between the {’s.

It is desirable to place a limit on the dose rate
in the vicinity of the reactor shield from the view

point of neutron activation of aircraft components.
A reasonable limit is that the dose rate of 64 ft
from the reactor should not exceed 125 rem/hr.
From the curve of Fig. 14.6 it is seen that this
shield optimization gives a dose rate of approxi-
mately 600 rem/hr at 64 ft from the rear of the
reactor. Thus, some correction should be made
to this shield. The limit on dose rate from the
rear of the reactor shield could be included as
another condition in the optimization calculation;
however, it would introduce a second Lagrange
multiplier and seriously complicate the iterative

procedure. A simpler procedure is, of course,

merely to add sufficient shielding to the rear
conical shells to reduce the dose rate to the de-
sired level. While this procedure does not make
precisely optimum use of the added weight, the

fact that only 11 cm of additional water is re-
quired on the rear to reduce the dose rate to the

desired level indicates that the results will not
be far from optimum. If the thicknesses of the

two rear conical shells of the calculated shield

were changed to 20 cm (T = T, = 20 cm), the
weight of the shield would be increased by 0.57
ton. The final shield weight would thus be 10.22
tons. }

It may also be seen from Table 14.1 that the
optimum shield has a ratio of crew-compartment

shield weight to reactor shield weight of approxi-
‘mately 1.6. If the calculation were carried out

for a larger crew compartment, this ratio would
decrease, and a larger fraction of the weight would
be shifted to the reactor shield. Thus, the larger
the crew compartment, the more nearly the limit
on dose rate at the rear of the reactor is satisfied
by the calculated optimum shield. Conversely,
if the crew compartment were smaller, weight
would be shifted from the reactor shield, and the
limit on the dose rate from the rear of the reactor

"would be more seriously violated by the calcu-

lated optimum shield.

by using the TSF reactor inside the GE-ANP RI
shield mockup? as a source.

Dose-rate measurements (Fig. 14.8) along the
y axis {fore to aft) of the crew-compartment mock
up indicate a relatively large contribution from
the sides of the mockup, with only a small amount
of radiation penetrating the shadow shield at the
rear of the mockup. Data for the curve labeled
“Compartment D Empty” were obtained when
compartment D of the reactor shield was filled
with air.

The gommae-ray dose rates in the front half of
the crew compartment mockup were measured with
the relative position of the crystal and preamplifier
reversed from that shown in Fig, 14.7. Shielding
the detector by the preamplifier and the Lucite
spacer resulted in a 10% reduction in dose when
data were taken in the front portion of the crew
compartment.

Gamma-ray dose rates were also measured along

the x axis (left to right) for various values of y
