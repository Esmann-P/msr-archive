PRELIMINARY DESIGN STUDY OF A CONTINUOUS FLUORINATION—
VACUUM -DISTILIATION SYSTEM FOR REGENERATING FUEL AND
FERTILE STREAMS IN A MOLTEN SALT BREEDER REACTOR

C. D. Scott.

ABSTRACT

The purpose of this study was to make a preliminary
design and an engineering evaluation of a conceptual plant
for treating the fuel and fertile streams of a molten-salt
breeder reactor. The primary requirements of the process
aré to recover the unburned fuel (233UF)) and fuel-stream
carrier salts (LiF BeFp ) from the fuel stream, and the
LiF -ThF), plus the bred 233U from the fertile stream. Both
streams must be sufficiently decontaminated for attractive
breeding performance of the reactor. The plant was designed
to operate continuously as an integral part of the reactor
system, fitting into two relatively small cells adjacent to
the reactor cell. In this study, the plant capacity is
based upon treating 15 £t3/day of fuel salt and 105 £t3/day
of fertile salt removed as side streams. These capacities
are adequate for a 1000-Mw (electrical) power reactor.

As to the fuel stream, basically it is purified by
fluorination and vacuum distillation. The first step
removes uranium as volatile UFg; the second recovers the
LiF -BeF, by simultaneously volatilizing these two compo-
nents from the less volatile fission products. Fortunately,
the fission products so separated are primarily the rare
earths, which are the most serious neutron poisons. The
UFg from the Tluorinator is accompanied by some volatile

‘fission product fluorides, primarily those of Mo, Te, Ru,
.Zr, and Nb, which are removed by sorption on granular NaF

and MgFo. Finally, the UFg is reduced to UF), by hydrogen

and recombined with the decontaminated LiF -BeFp carrier in

a -single operation. Fission products are removed from the
plant by discard of NaF and MgF, sorbents and the still
residue, which is & highly concentrated solution of the rare

earths in LiF. Wastes are permanently stored underground.

With respect to the fertile stream, the process consists
only of fluorination followed by decontamination of the UFg
on NaF and MgFo sorbents. It is only necessary to remove the.

bred °33u sufficiently fast to keep a low concentration in

the blanket, thereby ensuring a low fission rate and negligible

i

" poisoning by fission products. Discard of the barren fertile
stream at a slow rate suffices to keep the fission product
concentration at a tolerable level.

The chief conclusions of this study are: (1) that the
fluorination-distillation process for the fuel stream and the
fluorination process for the fertile stream comprise a compact
and relatively simple system that can be engineered with a
normal smount of developmental work, and (2) that integration
of the processing plant into the reactor facility is both
feasible and economical and the logical way to take advantage
of the processing possibilities of a fluid -fueled reactor.

The nominal cost of this plant is presented in the following
summary of major items:

Process equipment and building space $5, 302, 000

Fuel salt inventory - oo 89, 500
Fertile salt inventory : : 69, 200
NaK coolant inventory : 40, 000
Direct operating cost 788, 000/year

These costs contribute about 0.2 mill/kwhr to the fuel cycle
cost when the reactor operates at an 80% plant factor and
capital charges are amortized at 10%/year. This cost is
sufficiently low to add to the incentive for developing the
molten -salt breeder reactor.

Some of the steps of the evaluated process are based on

well established technology, whereas others are based on
. extrapolations of laboratory and small -scale engineering data.

Fluoride volatility and associated UFg decontamination by
sorption are well-known operations, having been demonstrated
in a pilot plant. However, vacuum distillation and liquid-
phase reduction of UFg to Fy have been demonstrated only at
the bench. Certainly, more development of these steps is
required for a complete process demonstration. A singularly
serious problem is the corrosive nature of the fluorine-molten
salt mixture in the fluorinator. However, this study shows
that this and other inherent processing problems can be solved
by proper design and operation of equipment.

INTRODUCTION

— i «

A reactor concept that hes a high potential for economic production of

‘nuclear power and simultaneous breeding of fissile material on the thorium-

uranium fuel cycle is the molten -58lt breeder reactor (MSBR). This reactor
utilizes two fluid streams. .For this study, the stream compositions are:
(1) a fuel stream consisting of an LiF -BeF, (69-31 mole $) carrier that
contains the fissile component, and (2) a fertile stream, which surrounds
the fuel stream, consisting of a 71-29 mole % LiF -ThF) mixture. In each
stream the lithium is about 99.995 at. % Tri. The above compositions are
not unique; other MSBR designs might use different compositions.” The con -

 

from the fuel stream into the surrounding fertile stream, where capture

by thorium breeds additional 233y fuel. The reactor is operated at an
average temperature of about 650°C; fission energy is recovered in external.
heat exchangers through which the fuel and fertile streams are circulated.
Sustained breeding performance of the MSBR depends on the removal of
fission and corrosion products from the two fluid streams so that parasitic
neutron capture is. kept to a tolerable rate. Portions of the two circu-
lating streams are continuously. removed, processed for removal of fission
products, fortified with makeup fissile and fertile materials, and returned
to the reactor in a cyclic operation. | |

A primary consideration of any process for recycling reactor fuel is

intolerable capital investment or operating expense. In the MSER system,
this requirement applies to both fuel and carrier components. As mentioned
above, the fuel is 233y, and one carrier component is the highly enriched
Tra isotope. The other ma jor constituents, beryllium and thorium, are less
expensive; yet large losses of these. cannot be tolerated either because of

the adverse effect on fuel cycle cost and fuel conservation. The process

~The work reported here is unique in that it examines a processing
plant integrated directly into the reactor system, which, in effect,

accomplishes on-stream processing. This method obviates the cumbersome

. - Lh

and expensive transfer of highly radioactive material by carrier shipment;
furthermore, common use can be made of services and equipment necessary
to the reactor, thus avoiding the duplication that results in a separate
‘processing building. Also, since the spent fuel flows directly into the °
processing plant, there is minimal out-of -pile inventory of valuable fuel
components.

Another interesting feature of this study is the use of the relatively
recent concept of vacuum distillation as a means of purifying the carrier
salt. A modest vacuum of only 1 to 2 mm Hg is required, but the tempera -
ture (about 1000°C) is higher than any normally encountered in handling
molten fluoride salts. The operation was explored first by KelleyS in
laboratory experiments that indicated LiF -BeF, decontamination from
fission products by factors of 10° to 103. The attractiveness of the
process lies in the fact that it involves only a physical operation that
is easily controlled and that can be made continuous. Fission products
can be concentrated in the still residue (primarily TL.iF) by a factor of
about 250 by using the decay heat of the fission products to volatilize
LiF -BeF,. This high concentration factor ensures a low discard rate for
the valuable Tei. Cyclic operation of the still was assumed, allowing
the fission product concentration to increase with time. The corresponding
increase in the rate of decay heat generation limited the cycle time to
about 68 days. Although limited experience with the distillation step
indicates that high-nickel alloys are satisfactory structural materials
for use at this relatively high operating temperature, a more extensive
“investigation is needed to define the design limitations.

A novel idea has also been studied in the evaluation of liquid-phase
reduction of UFg to UF), by hydrogen. Initial bench-scale experiments?
have given promising data. The reaction is carried out by absorbing Ure:
in a molten mixture of LiF -BeF, -UF) at about 600°C followed by contacting
with H, to reduce UF in situ. This technique avoids the troublesome
problem of remotely handling solids (small UF), particles) that would be
met if the customary gas-phase reduction of Fe were used.

“Aside from indicating the feasibility and economy of the process,
this study also uncovered important design and engineering problems
associated with the scaleup of laboratory and batchwise operations to.

THE MOLTEN -SALT BREEDER REACTOR SYSTEM

The processing system of this study is designed to meet the

requirements of the molten -salt breeder reactor shown in Fig. 1. This

is a conceptual designt of a pover reactor capable of producing 1000 Mw

(electrical) with a thermal efficiency of 45%. Basically, it consists

of a graphite matrix enclosed in a cylindrical Hastelloy N vessel for

containment. Graphite occupies about 79 vol 4% of the core, fuel salt

about 15 vol %, and fertile salt about 6. The flow passages are such
that the fuel and fertile streaus: do not mix. The core is surrounded
redially and axially by a 3. 5-ft blanket of LiF MIF) mixture, and the

core is about 8 ft in diameter and 17 ft high; overall, the reactor plus
breeder blanket is about 16 ft in diameter and 25 ft. high.

Fission energy is recovered in a battery of ‘external heat exchangers
through which the fuel snd: fertile streams are continuously circulated.
The coolant may be elther a molten carbonate or fluoride salt mixture
which transports the heat to boilers for producing steam. Small side-
streams of fuel and fertile fluids are continuously withdrawn from the

reconstituted with makeup materials, the two fluids are returned to the
reactor via the fuel -makeup system. The processing cycle is selected to
‘give the optimum combination of fuel-cycle cost and breeding gain.

The data presented in Table 1 are typical for the MSER and were the
bases for this study. 2 Since the reactor concept is undergoing engineer-
ing and physics” evaluation; these data represent no fixed design and are
subject to change as the studies progress.

DESIGN CRITERIA

 

The following discussion delineates ground rules and arguments for
the particular choice of process and design used in this evaluation.
Choices were made on the basis of existing knowledge and data. The study
presented here is expected to verify basic assumptions or indicate

‘Judicious alternatives.

 

 

Basic Considerations

 

.

One basic consideration concerns the fuel yield (the fraction of
fissile inventory bred per year) which, for a breeder reactor, is inversely
- proportional to the total inventory of the reactor and chemical plant
‘systems. This characteristic is essential to the _design of an MSBR pro-

 

. cessing plant and suggests close -coupling of the reactor and processing
s BN plant to give minimal out of -reactor inventory. A fluid -fueled system
is readily amenable to this type of operation, and for this evaluation
the processing plant is integrated with the reactor plant. This design
permits fast, continuous processing, restricted only by the rather
stringent design requirements: for fission-product decay -heat removal and
corrosion resistance.
The integrated plant: occupies cells adjacent to the reactor cell, and
all services available to the reactor are available to the chemical plant.
O These include mechanical equipnent, compressed gases, heating and ventilat-
ing equipment, electricity, etc. The cost savings for an integrated

facility are immediately apparent when one considers the large amount of
equipment and facility duplication required for separate plants.

A further basic consideration is that there will be no large
extrapolation of technology in the process design. Accordingly, the
process is based on treating the molten salt by fluorination and distilla-
tion, with the supporting operations of UFg sorption on and desorption

~ from beds of pelletized NaF, followed by reduction of the UFg to UF) . A

large amount of data is availablé for each step except for the distilla-
tion and reduction operations, both of which have been demonstrated in

the laboratory. 3,26 However, this study does assume the necessary
engineering extrapolations to convert from the current batchwise operations

to continuous operations.
Process for the Fertile Stream

The two streams of the breeder reactor require different processing
rates and must be treated separately to prevent cross contamination. The
first step in process for the fertile stream consists only of continuous
filuorination, which removes the bred uranium as the volatile hexafluoride.
No other treatment is needed if this step is designed to maintain a low
uranium concentration. To accomplish this, the stream is required to go :

- through the processing plant on a relatively short cycle, for example,

once every 20 to 50 days. The cycle time for this study is 22 days. The

~ fission rate in the blanket 1s low, and the fission products are kept at
- a tolerable level by periodic discard of barren LiF -ThF) salt. A 30-year

discard cycle suffices. In the second step, the volatilized UFg is sorbed

‘on NaF beds, ‘desorbed, and finally caught in cold “traps.

Process for the Fuel Stream

The fuel stream of The reactor is processed by fluorination and
vacuum distillation to recover both uranium and carrier salt sufficiently
decontaminated of fission products. A cycle time of U0 to TO days is
required to maintain the fission -product concentration at a low enough

level for attractive breeding performance. The calculations of this study
 

 

-10 -

are for a 58-day cycle. The Fe is recovered by NaF sorption and cold
traps, just as for the fertile stream. Decontaminated fuel and carrier
are recombined in a reduction step that converts We to UF), and further
purifies by reducing corrosion products (iron, nickel, chromium) to their
metallic states. Makeup fuel and carrier are added at this point, and “
the stream is returned to the reactor.
The time that the fuel stream spends in the processing plant is kept

as short as practicable to minimize out-of -reactor inventory.

‘Waste Storage : -

";

The chemical plant provides its own storage system for protess
wastes. Incidental wastes, such as slightly contaminated aqueous solutions
‘and flush salts, are assumed to be handled by the reactor waste system,
thus such facilities are not duplicated for the processing plant. ‘Separate
storage is provided for fuel-and fertile-stream wastes, which are primarily
LiF plus fission products, and LiF THF), respectively. The facilities are
designed for a 30-year capacity and are located underground a short
distance from the chemical processing area.

The fuel -stream process also produces a less radioactive waste than the
LiF-fission-product mixture. This waste is in the form of pellets of sodium
fluoride and magnesium fluoride pellets used for decontaminating uranium hexa -

fluoride. Interim storage of 5-year duration is provided for these solids.
" Fission-product decay heat is removed either by forced air or natural

I]

convection, as required by the heat load.

"

Operating Policy

Certain ground rules consistent with convenient and safe operation
were adopted for this study. Maintenance operations are facilitated by
assigning unit-process steps to either a high- or a low-radiation level
cell. Operating and maintenance personnel, who are not required on a full-
time basis, are to be shared with reactor operation. No water or aqueous
solutions are to be admitted to the process cells; fluids required for heat oO

transport will be either air or sodium-potassium eutectic (NaK). A barren
 

[2

-11 -

fluoride salt, for example, an NaF -XF mixture, would be an acceptable
substitute.

~.- Process Data

~The primary concern of a processing cycle for short -cooled fluoride
mixtures is in dissipating fission product decay energy so that process
operations can be controlled. ‘A maximum of about 6.5% of the total energy
of the system is associated with beta and gamma energy in the fission
products; this amounts to about 1k0 Mw (thermal) in the MSER fuel stream.

- Most of this energy is emitted quickly, decreasing about 82% in 1 hr and

N

, purified salt to the fuel system after necessary reconstitution with

95% in 1 day. The data for this study were calculated for the reactor
described in Table 1, using the PHOEBE Code, * which computes gross fission-
product decay energy as a function of exposure and time after discharge
from the reactor. The data are presented graphically in Figs. 2a-b and

3a-b for fuel and fertile streams, respectively.

The - graphs give an upper limit for heat generation because the
calculations do not account for possible intermittent reactor operation
attributable to the 80% plant factor. In addition, the graphs include
decay energy associated with gaseous products that are sparged in the
reactor circulating loop and with those fission products that might
deposit on surfaces throughout the system. It is difficult to separate
this energy from gross energy until more is known about ‘the behavior of
fission products in molten fluorides.

A process flowsheet showing material balances for the fuel and fertile

. streams in the processing plant is included in Appendix F.

IRSCRIPEION OF PROCESS

v The processing facility must have the capability of removing the major
portion of fission products from the molten fuel salt and returning the

233,

and carrier salts. As to bhlanket-salt processing, the facility must achieve

. recovery of the ma jor portion of the bred uranium for recycle to the fuel
~ stream or for sale. These goals can be met with present technology or with

processes that can be reasonably extrapolated from current technology.

Summary of the Process Flowsheet

In Fig. 4 it can be seen that fuel -stream processing is achieved by
first removing the uranium (as 233) and volatile fission products from ~
a side-stream of the molten salt by fluorination. Then the carrier salt
is vacuum-distilled from the residual fission products. Next, the We,
further purified by a sorption-desorption process based on the use of NaF
| pellets, is dissolved in the carrier salt. Finally, the UFg is reduced
to UF) by hydrogen, thereby reconstituting the fuel salt.

Blanket salt is processed concurrently with the fuel salt by
“ fluorinating a side-stream. The We gas is separated from the volatile
fission -product fluorides by sorption and desorption, using beds of NaF
pellets as mentioned above. The blanket salt needs no further purification,
and a portion of tne 23 is sent to the fuel stream by dissolving it in
the carrier salt and reducing it with hydrogen. The excess over that
needed to refuel the reactor is sold.

The two chemical reactions (fluorination and reduction) in the
process are simple, fast, and quentitative. The other interactions are
physical and require only heat and mass transport; however, in the case
of distillation, a rather high temperature (about 1000°¢) is involved.

The salt is extremely stable at any temperature anticipated in this
process, and other physical properties, primarily vapor pressure and

solubility for fission products, are in accord with process requirements.

Fluorination

i

As noted above, uranium and volatile fission products are removed
from both streams by fluorination. A batchwise, molten-salt fluoride-
volatility process for recovering uranium has been under development for
several years. Currently the process is in the pilot plant phase at
orne.. 17718 One of the steps in this process is batch fluorination of the
molten fluorides to remove uranium hexafluoride. As noted before, uranium
in these streams is in the form of UF. This uranium and some of the
fission products are converted by fluorine to higher -valent, volatile oO

fluorides which leave the salt and go to the uranium hexafluoride

purification system. The reaction for producing UFg in the present batch
processing is the same as that for the proposed continuous system and may

be represented as follows:
UF), + Fy, =» UFg .

Certain fission-product fluorides are also volatile. The principal
ones are: Ru, Nb, Cs, Mo, and Te. Zirconium is volatilized to a lesser
degree. |

Continuous processing of the MSBR fuel salt can be best achieved if
the fluorination process is made continuous, preferably with counter-
current contacting of the molten salt and fluorine. Such a process has
not been developed, and the present volatility process at ORNL is entirely
a batch process. Therefore, development work will be necessary to provide
for continuous fluorination.

_ Rate data for molten-salt fluorination are limited and conflicting,
although the reported rates have been sufficient for the batch process.
Mailen's data’? on the fluorination of falling droplets of molten salt
support the view that the reaction itself is very fast; whereas, the
slower rates that result from sparging a pool of molten salt with fluorine
(Cathers et a1.,2° Pitt, >t and Moncrief~?) can be explained by assuming a
mass transfer -controlling rate mechanism due to inefficient mixing of the
gas and liquid phases. Contact times (fluorine and molten salt) of 1 to
2 hr have been shown to be adequate for uranium removal down to 10 ppm in
such batch tests. The countercurrent, continuous operation, envisioned
here, would probably give better contact. It is difficult to predict the
fluorine utilization in a continuous fluorinator; however, it should be
better than that for batch fluorination, which suggests that a utilization
of 33-1/3% will probably be achieved.

A relatively low mass flow rate of gas must be maintained in the
fluorinetor to prevent salt entrainment in the off-gas. The highest mass
flow rate that has been used successfully without entrainment is 0.28 slpm
per in.? of fluorinator cross section.>3 >

for this study. This frozen wall of salt, which is ‘kept so by & high
cooling rate on the metal wall, prevents gross corrosion. Internal
heating keeps the rest of the salt molten. For the fuel stream, fission-
product heat is sufficient for this purpose, but for the blanket stream

for resistance heating. Since a maximum of ‘1.5 kw of heat per pt? of wall
area can be removed from such a system, the fuel stream will have to be
delayed in & cooling tank until the heat generation due to decay heat is
at a sufficiently low level. As to the blanket salt, decay heating Will
be insignificant. |

~~ The continuous fluorinator is a tall column into which molten salt
is fed at the top and flows to the bottom; fluorine is introduced at the’
bottom and passes to the top, accompanied by the volatile fluorides (Fig. 5).
An expanded deentrainment section is added to the top, and the body of the
column is jacketed with a coolant to maintain the frozen salt wall. A
gravity leg is used in the molten salt outlet to hold a constant salt level

in the column.
Purification of Uranium Hexafluoride by Sorption and Desorption

The UFg from both streams is purified in the same way before being
returned to the fuel stream... Since the We that leaves the fluorinator
contains volatile fission products, it is purified by a series of sorption
steps. These are batch steps, but the process is made. continuous by
using parallel beds alternately. i

Molybdenum fluoride is removed from the UFg by isolating the 100°¢
NeF zone, desorbing the UF and molybdenum fluoride (by raising the
temperature to >150 °c and passing fluorine through the bed), and passing
desorbed gas through a fixed bed of MeF,, which is held at about 150 °c.
The MgF, sorbs the molybdenum but allows the purified UFg to pass through
into the cold traps.

The NaF pellets used in the high-temperature zone must be replenished
periodically since they accumulate fission products and corrosion products.
This discard constitutes one of the waste streams. The two NaF sorption
zones may be integrated into a single unit, one zone on the other, and, as
NaF is discharged from the lower zone, it can be replenished by NaF from
‘the low-temperature zone, which is in turn fed with fresh NaF pellets.
Such a system has been used effectively in pilot plant operations, and a
similar system would be desirable for the MSBR processing facility. l7718
In our concept, the system has a movable bed of NaF pellets, and, after
each sorption cycle, some of the lower NaF is mechanically ejected to
-waste. Annular design with air cooling would probably be necessary to
allow removal of fission product heat (Fig. 7).

As the UF leaves the last sorption trap it must be collected and
ultimately used as feed for the fuel -reconstitution step. This is done
by collecting the UF in cold traps. Two cold traps are connected in
series. The first, or primary trap, is operated at about -40°C, and the
second, or backup trap, is operated at about 60° C. The principal design
"consideration is the heat transfer rate. Conventional designs are avail-
able for such units in which there are internal cooling fins for collecting
UF, and Calrod heaters for vaporizing the UF for removal (Fig. 8).
Uranium hexafluoride from the heated cold trap is fed directly to the
reduction process. This calls for at least three primary cold traps for-
continuous operation: one for collecting UF, one for feeding UF, and
one in transition between these two functions.

A fixed bed of NaF at ambient temperature very effectively removes
trace amounts of Ug from gas streams. Such beds are used as backup UF,
traps in the fluorine exhaust from the cold traps and in other process
streams that might’ contain We. Uranium is recovered from such traps by

using the NaF as charge material for the main absorption beds.

Since there is excess fluorine in the fluorinator off-gas (33-1/3%
utilization), fluorine is recycled. This recycle contains some fission
products, so it is necessary to remove a side-stream (10%) to prevent
their buildup. Fresh fluorine is used for the desorption step, for all

processing in the blanket section, and for fluorine makeup.
Vacuum Distillation

The vacuum distillation step applies to the fuel stream only and is
used to separate the carrier salt from the fission products after the
uranium is removed by fluorination (see above). The LiF and BeF,
volatilize, leaving fission products in the still bottoms. This residue -
consists largely of rare-earth fluorides. If the relative volatilities
of the fission products, compared with the volatilities of LiF and BeF,,
are low, then a good separation can be achieved in a single -step
distillation without rectification.

At the average operating temperature (about 650°C) of the MSBR itself,
the solubility of rare-earth fluorides in fuel salt is only a few-.-mole
percent; however, at 1000°C, the solubility in LiF alone is about 20 mole %
for the more insoluble compounds, for example, LaF 3 PIF, and CeF 5. Other
rare-earth (KE) fluorides have even higher solubilities at this temperature.”
Physics calculations on the 58-day-cycle MSBR indicate “that at equilibrium

“the molar ratio of LiF: (RE)F 5 in the fuel is about 1400, & number consid-

erably greater than “the - 1:1 3 io permitted by the solubility limit at
1000° C. It is therefore apparent that, based on solubility date alone,
distillation at about 1000°C ‘can tolerate an extremely large rare-earth
concentration factor before precipitation occurs. The design of the
distillation unit is concerned primarily with determining the appropriate
configuration that will permit a large: fission-product concentration
factor and, at the same ‘time, provide adequate heat -removal capability f for
the short cooled fuel. : o CL

The still design developed for this study is ‘shown in Fig. 9. It is

as that in the reactor fuel; this volume fills the tubes to a depth of

to 1 to 2 mm of Hg by evacuating the product receiver (see Fig. D-3 in
Appendix D), and the temperature is adjusted and held at about 1000°C.
Fluorinated fuel salt is continuously admitted to the LiF pool in the

still, and distillation is allowed to proceed at the same rate as the

inlet fuel rate so that there is no net volume change.

The operating principle is to allow the rare-earth fission products,

© which have a much lower vapor pressure than either LiF or BeF,,, to con-

centrate in the still. The liquid pool in the still reaches an equilibrium
concentration in LiF and BeF,, and the two components then distill at the
rate at which each is entéring the still. The condenser is a conical
region located just above the evaporating surface; it is kept at about
850°¢ by forced convection of heated air. Distillate is collected in a
circular trough and drained to a product receiver. The still is operated
in this way until the heat-generation rate due to fission-product decay
reaches the heat -removal capability of the Nak cooling system. This

point occurs after about 67 days of continuous operation, at which time

the fission product concentration in the still is about 14 mole %, a

value considerably less than the approximately 50 mole % solubility limit

at 1000°C. At this time, the contents of the still are drained to a
permanent waste receiver, and the cycle is repeated. These calculations
are conservative since they are based upon gross fission-product heat
release and do not subtract the effect of those fission products removed
or deposited in the reactor. before chemical processing.

} The attractive feature of carrying out the distillation in this way
is that it minimizes the volume of expensive LiF relegated to waste.

Since distillation is carried out after fluorination, less than 0.1% of
the uranium removed from the reactor should enter the st111, and at 1000°C
the vapor pressure of UF) is favorable to the recovery of a significant

‘portion of this fraction, reducing the overall uranium loss. Beryllium

fluoride losses should be insignificant because the vapor pressure of -
BeF, at 1000°C is about 100 times that of LiF, Distillation probably

“will not effect decontamination from CsF and RbF; each of these com-

pounds has a greater vapor pressure than either BeF, or LiF. Because
rare earths are concentrating in the still as a function of time, their

decontamination factor in the product will decrease with time. It is not

possible with existing date to assess the magnitude of this effect.

 
 

 

 

-28 - ‘

Detailed calculations for the still design are given in Appendices C
and D. Vapor pressure data for principal components of the fuel stream
are included in Appendix F.

Distillate from the still is collected in an evacuated tank operating
at still pressure. When filled, the receiver is isolated from the still,
and the LiF -BeF,, mixture is transferred by gravity flow or pressurization
to the reduction and fuel -makeup operations.

~ An in-cell waste receiver is provided for the initial cooling of the
still residue before transfer to the underground waste -storage facility.
The tank has a Lb-£t> volume, allowing a one-cycle delay (about 67 days)
' inside the cell where heat is conveniently removed by the circulating Nak
coolant. During this delay, the heat generation rate decreases from

3.2 x 107 Btu/hr to 6.8 x 1°, imposing less stringent design requirements

in the permanent waste receiver. The interim receiver is a shell-and-
tube type, similar to the still; however, no condensing surface or

provisions for air cooling are needed.
Reduction of Uranium Hexafluoride and Reconstitution of the Fuel

The combined UF streams, that form the fuel salt and the fertile
salt, are reduced to UF), and only a sufficient amount to maintain
criticality is returned to the reactor. The excess 233y from the fertile
stream is sold. The usual method for this reduction has been by reaction
with the excess H, in an Hy Fy, flame:

(BE, + Fy) CL

UF + H, UN UF), + 2HF .

This reduction is carried out in a tall column into which UFg and H, are
introduced into an By Fy flame, and dry UF), powder is collected as the
product. However, according to our proposal, a more convenient method
for preparing UF), for the MSBR is by reducing the UF to uF), with H,
after the UFg is dissolved in the molten salt. There are some experimental
data indicating the feasibility of such a process; however, the kinetics
of the absorption and of the reduction must be further investigated. 20 It

is possible that this two-step process could be carried out continuously

in a single column in which the molten salt flows upward, the UFe is
Introduced and dissolved in the bottom of the column, and the H, is
introduced at en intermediate point to reduce the Ug (Fig. 10). Some
of the reconstituted salt has to be recycled to the column to provide

enough dissolved uranium for proper Wg absorption.

. Qff-Gas Processing

Most of the off-gas from the processing plent comes from the
continuous fluorinators; smaller amounts are formed in various other Co

processing vessels. The gases are processed to prevent the release of

any contained fission products to the atmosphere. Excess fluorine used
in the fluorinators is recycled through a surge chamber by a positive -
displacement pump,’ and a small side-stream of the recycling fluorine is
sent through a caustic scrubber to prevent gross buildup of fission
products. Each of the processing vessels and holdup tanks have off-gas
lines which lead to the scrubber for removing HF, fluorine, and volatile

fission products.

The scrubber operates as a continuous, countercurrent, packed bed

" with recirculating aqueous KOH. A small side-stream of KOH solution is

sent to waste, and the scrubber off-gas is contacted with steam to
hydrolyze fission products such as tellurium. A filter removes the hydro -
lyzed products. - The noncondensable fission products are sent to the off-
gas facility for gases generated by the reactor.

Waste Storage

Four waste streams requiring storage leave the processing facility:

vaste from the KOH scrubber, (3) molten-salt residue from the distilla-

in separate underground facilities adjacent to the processing cells.

-The cylinders are loaded inside the processing cell and transferred to the

to contain a 5-year collection of cylinders (160 cylinders at 100% plant

factor); after 5 years, the older cylinders are removed and transferred
to a permanent underground storage site. The integrated heat generation

when the vault contains 160 cylinders is about 1.73 x 10° Btu/hr. Forced
circulation of about 11,300 scfm of air at a temperature rise of 125 °c is
used to remove this energy. The containers are constructed with a hollow
core, allowing coolant to pass through the cylinder as well as over the

outside.

Aqueous Waste from Off -Gas Scrubber

‘This waste, fission products in a strong solution of KOH, will be
stored along with other aqueous wastes from the reactor system and
represents an insignificant contribution to the total amount of agueous

waste.

Fuel -Stream Waste

Residue from the vacuum st111 is stored. in bulk in a facility similar
to one evaluated previously by Carter and Ruch. M+ A single, large tank-
equipped with adequate cooling tubes and adequate for a 30-year accumula -
tion of vaste is provided. The 30-year capacity was chosen since that is
the expected lifetime of the reactor. After filling, the salt might
remain in the tank for additional decay. or be disposed of by whatever
method is currently acceptable.

Decay heat is removed by forced air convection. The heat load (Btu/hr)
continually increases over the filling period but decreases rather sharply
vhen no further additions are made (Fig. E-1, Appendix E). The time
behavior of the integrated specific heat generation rate (Btu net £673)
for a 5-year collection period is shown in Fig. 11. This is a smoothed
curve for h-ft3 additions every 67.4 days, followed by an extended decay
period during which no waste is added to the tank. The upper portion of
the curve might be extrapolated with little error to accommodate longer
filling periods. Figure 11 shows the specific heat generation for the
case of no dilution with inert salt; however, during the initial stages } 2
of filling, it is necessary to add an inert diluent, for example, NaF -KF
eutectic mixture, to lower the specific rate to a tolerable value. It
was calculated that 264 £43 of diluent is required for the 520 £43 of
LiF -fission product residue to be collected over the 30-year period. The
fission products being collected exhibit the decay behavior shown in
Fig. 2, which is representative of gross fission products and does not

account for those that have been removed by processing or other mechanisms.

Fertile Stream Waste

 

The fertile-stream discard is also stored in a large underground tank,
adequate for 30 years of waste collection. The tank is 13.5 ft in diameter
and 13.5 ft high. Since uranium is removed from the blanket on a rather
fast cycle, the fission rate in the blanket is low, making the waste
activity several orders of magnitude less than that of the fuel waste. Sw
Cooling is provided by natural air convection around the tank and through
cooling tubes. All metal surfaces are expected to be coated with a layer
of frozen salt that will furnish excellent corrosion protection. oo.
The integrated heat production rate due to fission products for the
30-year period is 5.91 x 10% Btu/hr. Since this energy is associated
with 1783 £43 of LiF -ThF) mixture, the moderate specific rate of 33.1 Btu
prt £53 presents no design problems. When first removed from the
reactor, the heat production rate of the waste is about 1600 Btu hr
but this value decreases by a factor of 10 in about U4 days.

Cooling System for the Waste

As mentioned above, the waste-storage system is designed for cooling
by forced air draft. Air is easy to handle, compatible with construction
materials for extremely long times, and presents & minimum hazard in case
of contamination by the waste. Blowers, capable of supplying 76,000 scfm
at a pressure drop of about 30 in. water, are located upstream from the
waste vaults. The air 1s forced through the vaults and cooling tubes in
the waste tank and is exhausted to the stmosphere via a tall stack, which
also disposes of gases exhausted from the reactor system. The exit duct
contains the necessary radiation -monitoring instruments and absolute

filters for removing particles.

Possible Ultimate Treatment of Waste from Fertile Stream

Since a 30-year accumulation of waste from the fertile stream will
contain recoverable values (TL, 233g, and thorium), not too highly
contaminated with fission products, it may be worthwhile to consider a
recovery system before relegating this waste to permanent burial. Any
significant uranium value would probably be recovered by fluorination,
but the recovery of thorium and lithium requires further process develop -
ment. A potential method for Li-Th separation is the incompletely
investigated HF -dissolution process, based on the principle of leaching
LiF from ThE), and rare-earth fission products with anhydrous hydrofluoric
acid. This process, however, leaves the thorium contaminated with fission
products, making it necessary to resort to an aqueous system (solvent
extraction by the Thorex process) or to develop a thorium recovery process
that utilizes fluoride chemistry. From a purely economic viewpoint,
thorium would ve retained in the waste tank until its recovery became more
economical than mining new thorium. oo

on a 30-year discard cycle, an entire fertile -stream inventory of
ThF), and LiF will accumulate in the waste tank. In addition, the waste
will contain “33U, #33ps, and fission products in emounts that depend on
the breeding ratio, efficiency of the fluorination step, and the blanket
power. The uranium loss is based upon a 90% efficiency in fluorination,

a value believed to be conservative. The largest loss of fissionable

material, however, is through protactinium, which ve assume to be non-
volatile as the fluoride and which consequently is discarded in direct
ratio to its concentration. The amount of fission products is calculated

for a blanket power of 62 Mw (thermal) and an 80% plant factor; to account

for those fission products that have volatile fluorides or which are
plated out on parts of the system, ea nominal figure of 80% is used for
the fraction that finally reaches the waste tank. . The 30-year inventory
of the waste tank is shown in Table 2.

In view of the figures in Table 2, the design presented here for the |

value in the waste tank is attributable to 233pg discard; this loss can be
reduced to negligible proportions by -providing in —cell decay storage
followed by refluorination to recover the daughter 233y,
1-year holdup (about 60 £43) would allow more then 99.995% of the 233pg to

For example, a

decay to 233g, It probably would not be necessary to provide. additional

fluorination equipment for. this volume because the refluorination could be

scheduled in existing equipment during reactor shutdown.

Flow Control of the Salt Streams
‘ :
Flow control of the molten salt streams is by freeze valves coupled
with a controlled pressure drop. This can be achieved by the simple
freeze valve currently used in the MSRE (Molten Salt Reactor Experiment),

 
 

 

 

36 -
, / .
coupled with a flow restriction such as an orifice or venturi. A dynamic
freeze valve in which a controlled layer of salt is bullt up in a cooled
section of the line is being a estiented; if successful, it will allow a

greater ease of flow control.
Removal of Decay Heat

Heat removal is a major problem in all process vessels that contain
short -cooled, highly irradiated fuel. In many cases, the heat flux and
operating temperature will be high, meking it difficult to use water or
air as primary coolants. Water has an additional disadvantage in that it
is incompatible with the process fluids, creating a hazard should there
be a leak in the salt lines. Therefore, a sodium-potassium eutectic
mixture, 22.3-77.7 wt % Na-K, was chosen as the primary coolant for
process vessels at temperatures above 500°C where large amounts of decay
‘heat must be removed. This coolent also has the capability of initially
heating the system to 600°C for startup purposes. Air was chosen as the
coolant for low heat fluxes at temperatures less than 500°C.

Sampling the Salt and Off -Gas Streams

A rather complicated mechanism is required to remove analytical
samples from a highly radioactive molten-salt system. A technique similar
to that tested for the MSRE will be used, 2 and the off-gas streams will

be sampled conventionally.
Shielding, Maintenance, and Repair of Equipment

All process equipment that handles material that approaches the
radiation level in the reactor core will be shielded by about the same
amount of shielding as for the reactor, and maintenance will be indirect.
Process vessels in this area needing repair will be removed and sent to a
decontamination facility before repair. These include the fuel -stream
delay tanks, fluorinator, sorption-desorption systems, and distillation

system. All other equipment for processing radioactive materials is

PD]

-37 -

contained in an area of direct maintenance with less shielding. In the

“direct -maintenance ares, decontamination for maintenance is achieved by

a molten -salt flush and an aqueous wash.
‘Materials of Construction

All process vessels and lines in contact with molten salt are made
of INOR-8 except the fluorinators, which are made of a special material,
Alloy 794.28 Vessels and lines that contain fluorine or fluoride-bearing
gases are made of Inconel or Monel, and cold traps are made of copper.

Other equipment is made of appropriately compatible material.
General Operating Policy
The overall policy for operating the fluorinator, vacuum still, NaF

beds, and related equipment 1s based on the projected simplicity of opera-
tion and small size of the equipment. The system is designed for a

campaign -type operation of one month's duration, without shutdown except

for emergency maintenance. ‘There will be no access to the operating areas
during this period. At the end of the operating period, the entire system

~ will be closed down, routine maintenance accomplished, feed hoppers

replenished, accumulated waste transferred to waste storage, etc. The

operating cycle is then repeated.
PROCESS DESIGN

Process equipment for this design study was patterned as much as
possible after previously designed and tested equipment. Each ma. jor
component was studied for its application to the continuous processing
requirements of the MSBR to ensure a practical design. Detailed designs
were made to the extent that overall size, configuration, heat transfer
requirements, flow rates, etc., were defined to allow a reasonable
estimate of equipment cost. The waste system was considered separately,
and liberal use was made of a previous, similar study’ for its design
and cost data. | |

PIANT DESIGN AND LAYOUT

The inherent advantage of a fluid -fueled reactor is in close -coupling
the reactor and processing plants, thereby reducing capital investment,
inventory, and operating costs. This conceptual MSBR processing plant is
located in two cells adjacent to the reactor shield; one contains the high-
radiation-level operations, and the other contains the lower-radiation-
level operations. Each cell is designed for top access through a remov-
able biological shield having a thickness equivalent to 6 ft of high-
density concrete. Both cells are served by a crane used in common with
the reactor plant. ‘Process equipment is located in the cell for remote .
removal and replacement from above. No access into the cells will be
required; however, it is possible with proper decontamination to allow
limited access into the lower-radiation-level cell. A general plan of
the processing plant and a partial view of the reactor system is shown
in Dwg. 58050D in Appendix F. |

The highly radioactive cell contains only fuel -stream processing
equipment: the fluorinator, still, waste receiver, NaF end MgF, sorbers,
and associated vessels. The other cell houses the blanket -processing O
equipment, fuel- and fertile-stream cold traps, UFg reduction equipment,

and fuel- and fertile-stream makeup vessels. .

The high-radiation-level cell has a cross section of about 19 by

22 ft; the less radioactive cell measures about 27 by 30 ft. Bach cell
is about LO ft high, the same as that of the adjoining reactor cell. A
"cold" operating area, located along the face of the cells, has dimensions

12 by 62 ft and contains the cold makeup equipment, product receivers, and

process -gas supply. All process operations are carried out remotely from

the reactor control room.
COST ESTIMATE

One of the major goals in this design study was to estimate the cost
of an integrated facility for processing the fuel and blanket salts for
this conceptual 1000-Mv (electrical) MSBR. The estimate arrived at
includes the total fixed capital cost and the annual operating cost
which are, respectively, $5,301,510 and $787,790 per year. In general,
conventional -estimating practices were used except where past experience
in the nuclear energy field indicated changes.—2 So
It is difficult to separate the process building and its equipment

from the total reactor facility for cost-estimating purposes, since the

“building must be an integral part of the reactor installation. To

determine the relationship between the costs of integrated processing
plant and the reactor building, it was assumed that the Molten Salt
Converter Reactor (MSCR) facility, designed by Sargent and Lundy

Engineers, 33 represented the nonprocessing part of an MSER. Any required
"addition to the structure, facility, or operating cost of the MSCR due to

the addition of the processing facility was considered a cost of the

processing. facility. \

Several of the process vessels and auxiliary equipment are similar

conventional equipment sizes were extrapolated to meet the requirements

anticipated were considered to have costs comparable fo that of the MSRE

Structure and Improvements

Structure and improvements costs for the processing facility were
determined by assuming that these costs are directly related to corre-
sponding costs developed for the MSCR by Sargent and Lundy Engineers .>5
Addition of the processing facility proposed here called for an additional
16.56% of floor space in the reactor building, and this factor was used
to determine the cost from the corresponding MSCR data. The cost of the
crane and hoist was also increased by this amount. This additional space
includes a 10% increase in analytical and decontamination facilities.

The processing facility addition was 7.3% of the total building area;
therefore, cost of the grounds and stack was increased by 7.3%. The
total increase in cost of structure and improvements due to the processing

facility was $556,770, which was obtained as follows:

Structure 0.1656 x $2,932,400 = $485,610
Crane and hoist  - 0.1656 x 195,000 = 32,290
Grounds 0.073 x 501,500 = 36,610
Stack 0.073 x 31,000 = 2, 260

Total structures and improvements $556,770
Interim Waste Storage

The above cost schedule results in a total process piping cost of $155, 800.

. switching gear, feeders, and indirect connectors and Jumpers. Cost

schedules used for these auxiliaries vere: 29 :
~ Blectrical substation and switching : i, .60/kw
Overhead feeders : 6.1/ft
Underground feeders : $12.2/1t

The total: cost of electrical auxiliaries is estimated to be $84, 300.

- Process instrumentation is estimated to be $272,100, radiation

monitoring to be $100, 000, and sampling connections to be $20,000.

The costs of service lines and high-temperature insulation are based
on the installed cost of the process equipment in the main processing
 

 

 

areas and in the waste storage facility. The cost of service lines, taken
at 15% of the total installed cost of this equipment, amounts to $128,060;
the cost of the insulation, teken at 6% of this installed cost, amounts to
$51,220.

Total Fixed Capital Cost

The total direct plant costs are estimated to be $2,609,980 (Table 5).
Past experience was used to determine percentage costs of indirect capital
items. These percentages are higher than those for other chemical indus -
tries but represent actual cost experience in other ORNL projects. >
Construction overhead is estimated at 30% of total direct plant cost to
give a total construction cost of ‘$3,392,970. Engineering and inspection
at 25% of total construction cost is $848,240, which results in a sub-
total plant cost of $,241,210. Contingency at 25% of the subtotal plant
cost is $1,060,300, and the total construction cost is $5,301,510.

Inventory costs include the cost of the molten salt held up in the
system and the initial cost of the NaK coolant. Total fuel-salt holdup
for this system is 63 £3. At $1, keo/1t3, the charge is $89,460. Blanket-
salt holdup is 120 £43, and at $560/£43 the cost is $67,200. Fuel- and
. blanket -salt charges do not include the cost of fissile material. The
400 -£+3 holdup of Nak at $100/2t3 costs $40,000. The total inventory
cost is then $196,660, giving a total fixed capital cost of $5,498,170.

" Direct Operating Cost

The direct operating cost includes the cost of operators, chemical
consumption, waste containers, utilities, and maintenance materials. The
number of operating and support employees is based on a work schedule of
four shifts of 40 hr each per week. These include immediate supervisory,
operating, maintenance, laboratory, and health physics personnel, plus
two people for routine clerical and janitorial work (Table 6).

No attempt was made to prorate the cost of higher supervisory,
clerical, or plant protection personnel for the processing facility since

some of this cost is included in labor overhead costs.

Processing Cost

 

The processing cost per year is estimated at $1,447,570 (Table 8).
This cost is obtained by combining the direct operating cost, the indirect
cost of labor overhead (80% of direct labor cost), the fixed cost due to
depreciation (10% of fixed capital per year), taxes (1% of fixed capital
per year), and insurance (1% of fixed capital per year). The percentage
used for the indirect labor cost is arbitrary; however, it is within the
range of usual practice.

On the basis of 300 days of operation per year for the 1000-Mw.
(electrical) MSBR, the fuel -processing cost is 0.201 mill /kvhr. The fuel-
cycle cost is composed of this cost plus the in-reactor inventory of fuel,
fertile, and carrier salts, plus makeup fertile and carrier salts, and
less the credit for excess 233yr produced. In-reactor inventory, makeup,
and credit were not considered in this study.

‘Within the applied. ground rules, these costs are believed to be a
reasonably accurate representation of the cost for regenerating the fuel
and blanket in an integrated MSER processing plant. A more thorough
study would have included detailed design of equipment and layout of the
integrated processing plant, the reactor and its auxiliaries. Such a

thorough analysis was beyond the scope of this study.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The central issues in this preliminary study were to analyze the
feasibility and cost of a conceptual system for continuously regenerating
the fuel and fertile streams in the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor. Briefly,
the system consists in (1) fluorinating, distilling, and reconstituting
the molten fluorides used in the reactor core, and (2) recovering the
233y from the molten breeder blanket by fluorination and using the
uranium to reconstitute the core salt. The excess is to be sold. The
power of the breeder reactor was set at 1,000 Mw (electrical) for this
study.

A number of basic conclusions and essential recommendations were
developed. The conclusions relate to the projected feasibility and
anticipated costs in terms of established technology and cost-accounting
practices, and the recommendations refer to what must yet be learned with
respect to technology and chemical data before a complete engineering
analysis can be made. Tt is our opinion that it will be very useful to
 

 

LL

4

begin filling these gaps in the knowledge because of the promising

- 63 -

_ simplicity and low cost shown by this study.

In the conclusions and recommendations presented below, the

recommendations are underlined. - The first four numbered’ paragraphs

relate to general characteristics of this fuel -processing plant, and

the others to specific unit operations.

1.

FEASIBILITY. Fluorination followed by distillation is a
feasible process for regenerating MSER fuel (LiF -BeF,-UF),).
Fluorination alone is sufficient processing for the fertile
salt (LiF -ThF), ). Reactor physics calculations indicate that
attractive breeding ratios can be obtained for such a process.
Engineering problems in the processing plant appear to be
amenable to solution through a well-planned developmental

program at the unit-operations level. Fluorination-distillation

should be developed as the processing method for the MSBR. Con-
currently, other attractive processes should be investigated at
the laboratory and/or engineering stage as potential alternatives.

- INTEGRATED PLANT. Integrating processing and reactor facilities

is of primary importance in lowering the processing cost. Com-
plete advantage is thereby taken of the ready adaptability of a
fluid fueled reactor for continuous processing with corresponding

‘minimum inventory. The relatively small size of this side-
. stream processing plant, about 12 £t3 salt per day for a 1000 -Mw.

(electrical) reactor, is amenable to integrated construction,
thereby separating the economic dependence of the. processing

industry upon a large amount of installed electrical capacity.
The same financing convention that applies to the power plant

‘applies to the processing plant; this type of financing is

normally available at a lower rate than is available for a
separated processing facility.

ECONOMY. The estimated capital cost, excluding inventory, of
the plant is $5,301,000, and operating costs are about $788,000
a year. It is significant that the capital investment in the
integrated processing plant proposed here is only about Lg. of

the total cost of the reactor system it serves.

CORROSION. There are at least three areas in the chemical
processing plant in which corrosion behavior of construction
materials should be studied. These are the vacuum still, the
reduction unit, and filters. -The still temperature of about
1000°C is much higher than has been contemplated for any other
part of the MSER system, and the resistance of INOR-8 and
nickel to corrosive attack at this temperature is not known.

 

A reducer, hydrogen, enters the reduction unit and probably

helps limit corrosion there, but this should be verified.
Filters are subject to attack because of the large surface

area exposed to the fluid being. filtered.
 

- 6h -

. 5. FLUORINATION DEVELOPMENT. Batchwise fluorination of molten
fluoride salts for uranium recovery has been rather thoroughly
investigated at ORNL; however, it is recommended that engineering
development of a continuous fluorinator be given high priority.
The need for continuous fluorination is evidenced by the require-
ment of low fuel and carrier salt inventories in the processing
plant. The reactor fuel system contains about 650 ft3 of salt,
and, without continuous fluorination, the out-of -pile inventory
could possibly be as large as the in-pile inventory. This

study indicates that in a continuous fluorination-distillation
process the holdup represents about 10% of the reactor fuel
volume.

It is recommended that the frozen-wall concept for a a
continuous fluorinstor be developed and demonstrated. This
concept calls for a 1/2- to 3/4-in.-thick layer of frozen salt
on the inside wall of the fluorinator to prevent the serious
corrosive attack by the molten mixture during fluorimation.

Basic information needed includes fluorination rate data, process
control in continuous operation, and method of establishing and
maintaining a frozen wall.

- Fluorination of the fertile salt introduces problems
similar to those encountered for the fuel stream. However,
fertile-stream processing rates are 8 to 10 times higher, and
the fission-product activity is several orders of magnitude
less. On the other hand, a lower fluorination efficiency can
be tolerated in blanket processing.

Another method for continuous fluorination is the gas-
phase continuous operation in which fluoride microspheres are
generated and fluorinated as they fall through a tower. This
process should be recognized as a potential alternative to the
continuous method of fluorination studied here, but its
development should be subordinate to that of the frozen-wall
concept.

6. DISTILIATION DEVELOPMENT. The vacuum-distillation concept for
separating the LiF -BeFo (fuel-carrier salt) from fission products
is feasible _from an engineering viewpoint. The theoretical net
discard of Toi in the still waste is low enough that its cost is
insignificant compared with other fuel cycle costs. Thermal
problems require that sufficient volume be maintained for wetting
a large heat transfer surface, and the buildup of fission products
in this volume will almost surely have an adverse effect on the
decontamination factor of the distillate. Relative volatility
data are needed for the multicomponent mixture, LiF -BeF,-fission
products, in which compositions are in the range 99.5-0.5-0 mol %
to 8I.5-0.5-15 mol % LiF -BeF,-rare earth fluorides. It is

- strongly recommended that a continuous vacuum still be built and
operated to demonstrate a workable design and to obtain rate and
entrainment data.

The liquid-phase reaction proposed here is
more suitable for remote operation and should be developed. The
operating conditions that need study are: temperature, UF, con-
centration, reaction rate, nozzle design, circulation rate,
contactor design, and gas-liquid separation.

 

 

The reducing conditions that exist in this operation are

- consistent with those required for purging nickel, chromium, and

iron corrosion products from the fuel. Therefore the potentiality

 

of using the reduction unit for simultaneously giving the fuel a

.-final cleanup should be investigated.

SOLID -LIQUID SEPARATION. The general area of high-temperature,
solid -liquid separation in remote operations needs development.
Filtration techniques should surely be investigated to determine
operability and reliability in molten-fluoride systems.

FISSION PRODUCT BEHAVIOR. A better understanding of fission

 

 

‘product behavior throughout the processing plant is needed. In

particular, data are needed on the ways in which the various
nuclides partition in the several processing steps and on the
efficiency of removal. A more basic study is concerned with the
behavior of the fission products in the reactor environment to
determine whether or not certain nuclides remain in the reactor
systen.

 

~ URANIUM HEXAFLUORIDE PURIFICATION. The NaF and MgFs sorption

units provide adequate decontamination for UFg. The batchwise
units can be operated satisfactorily for both fuel and fertile

streams of the MSER; however, a cortinuous, temperature -zoned

system would reduce the frequency of cell entry. Probably the
largest uncertainties in UFg purification are in the removal of
tellurium and ruthenium; means of removing them should be

developed.

The portion of the fertile stream used as fuel makeup need
not be passed through a sorption system. because of the very

- small emount of fission-product contamination. However, the

UFg product that would eventually be handled by contact would
need purification. .

PROTACTINIUM REMOVAL. The most significant advancement in
fertile -stream processing can be made in the development of a
process that removes protactinium. To be effective, the process
must remove protactinium five to ten times as fast as its decay
rate; that is, the blanket volume would have to be processed

‘every four to eight days. Simplicity and ease of operation are

obvious requirements. Thus, & process based on forming protac-
tinium oxide by ion exchange appears promising and should be

studied.

 
 

 

- 66 -

Effective removal would obviate the need of sending any
portion of the fertile stream to waste and possibly reduce
makeup cost to that represented by thorium burnup alone. Such
& process is not required for economic operation of the MSBR
since fluorination and fractional discard can adequately control
the fission product concentration; however, the potential
advantage of reduced waste cost and improved breeding performance
argues for basic development of a process.

12. FUEL-STREAM WASTE SYSTEM. The most economical method of waste
- management consists in bulk storage in a large heat exchanger

tank. The heat generation problem is so severe that the plant
waste must be diluted with an inexpensive, inert material, which
complicates future processing for recovery of any contained
values. The calculated loss of 'Li and 3U in the fluorination-
distillation process is small, being only 1.5 to 2% of the fuel-
cycle cost.

The possible use of fission-product decay heat should not
be overlooked in the evaluation of an MSBR. The accumulated
waste generates about 4.5 Mw (thermal) throughout most of the
filling period of the waste tank. Thus salt-storage temperature
can be maintained high enough to make the waste tank a source of
high-temperature energy. i

13. FERTILE -STREAM WASTE SYSTEM. The fertile-stream waste contains
a significant inventory of valuable materials whose recovery is
probably warranted. At the end-of the 30-year filling period,
the waste tank contains about 14, 000 kg of Th, 10,400 kg of
TLi, and 116 kg of 233U; the 33U is isotopically pure material,
having been formed almost entirely out of the fission zone.
Although not considered in this study, an in-cell decay period
of about six months followed by refluorination appears to be
advisable for greatly reducing the amount of ©33Pa that enters
the waste tank.

14. PROCESS CONTROL. This aspect of plant operation was given only
a cursory review in this study, ahd no areas of unusual control
difficulty were observed. A flow-control device for the molten-
salt stream is needed, and the dynamic freeze valve concept
should be developed. Analytical and sampling requirements
require a more thorough study than was given here.

APPENDIX A. DESIGN CALCULATIONS FOR FUEL
SALT FLUORINATOR AND COOLING TANK

The unit operation of fluorination requires temperature control at

: about 550°C for the salt being fluorinated. The fact that this salt is

‘highly radioactive introduces a problem because it is necessary to extract

this decay heat through the walls of a fluorinator whose size is fixed by
other process requirements, such as throughput and residence time. If
there is insufficient heat transfer surface available for this purpose,
then the salt must be allowed to "cool" before entering the fluorinator.
The solution to this problem is to insert a cooling tank immediately
upstream of the fluorinator.

The following calculations pertain to the thermal design and size of
the fuel -salt fluorinator and the size of the cooling tank. It was
determined that the maximum permissible heat flux for the fluorinator is
5.31 x 10% Btu hr ™t £173 and that the size is 4.75 in. in diameter by

10.3 £t high. The cooling tank requires a volume of 22.5 £43. A further

result of this calculation is a graph of heat generation rate at the

cooling tank exit as & function of elapsed time since discharge from the

reactor.
The fluorinator design criteria are:
Fuel -salt flow rate 15 £t3/day
Uranium rate 77.3 g-moles/day
Fluorine utilization 33-1/3% 2
" Maximum mass flow rate of gas 0.277 slpg/in.
. Maximum heat flux through the frozen wall 1.5 kw/ft
"Heat of reaction (UF) + Fp = UFg) -162 kcal/g-mole
Residence time of salt 2 hr
The Fy flow rate through the column is:
F = 1-3 x 3 = 231.9 g-moles,
: = 4.83 sipm .
Fluorinator cross-sectional area is: :
# C 4.83 - 3 . 2
A = 0-277 = 17 5 in. ,

‘The total column volume needed is:

Therefore, the column height is:

The area of the frozen wall per linear foot of column is:

The open volume per foot of column is:
, vs = 0.1204 £43 .

Therefore, the maximum heat removal rate in the frozen-wall column is:

_ 1.25 x 1.5 x 3413 _ 4 <1 _.-3

But, the heat of reaction contributes at the following rate:

Six 1-05 Xx. 0.053 = 1620 Btu hr | £57

Thus, allowable fission product heating is:

5.15 x 10% Btu hr L £573 |

The surge tank must have sufficient capacity to allow the fuel salt to
cool to a heat rate of 5.15 x 10" Btu hr" £673. If the tank is assumed
to be well-mixed, and assuming that the heat generation rate of the salt

.can be expressed as an exponential function of time, then, 3

The data on heat generation rate with respect to time elapsed since

the salt has been removed from the reactor can be expressed as a series of

"equations of the form of Eq. (A-1). Six intervals were chosen from the

data in Figs. 2a and b (see text). In each time interval, the constants

of the exponential equation approximation were determined by coupling the
equation at the two ends of the time interval. This resulted in a repre-
sentation of the heat generation data, which was always equal to or some-
what greater than the calculated heat generation rate. The values of the

constants in the approximate equations are:

This equation was used to determine heat generation rate of the

APPENDIX B. FISSION -PRODUCT HEAT GENERATION RATES
IN THE MOVABLE -BED SORBERS AND NaF WASTE TANKS

Heat generation rates for the following components are presented here:
Movable -Bed Sorber
Sodium Fluoride Waste Tanks

Short Term Cooling Station
for Waste Sodium Fluoride

Interim-Storage of Waste

Fission products, which are volatilized in the fluorinator, accumulate
in the movable-bed sorbers and create a heat source that must be considered
in the design of these units. Excess heat must be removed so that it does
not interfere with control of bed temperature. Actual removal of the heat
-is not the problem here since sorbers, which accomplish this end, have been
designed -and used in the ORNL Volatility Pilot Plant.

The essential problem is to estimate the heat generation rate due to
radioactive decay of the fission products present in the system projected
here. This was done by first assuming that half the fission-product heat
generating capacity which reached the fluorinator would exit to the sorber.
Further, all the fission-product heat is concentrated in the lower zone in
the sorber, and it was removed in the NaF waste stream. As noted before,
one -fifth of the lower zone is exhausted per day, and there are two parallel
sorbers alternately operating for 12 hr each. This results in an accumula -
tion of decaying fission products or of decreasing heat sources in the
sorber, in the NaF waste tanks, and finally in the interim waste -storage”
facility.

The heat generation rate for various process components was approximated
by determining the average heat generation rate during a specific time
period, and by assuming that this rate decayed as the total fission-product
heat rate decayed as shown in Figs. 2a and b. The accumulated heat
generation rate could then be expressed as a rate characteristic of fission
products having an "average" age intermediate between the oldest and the

most recently sorbed.

-T79 -
Movable -Bed Sorber

In the movable -bed sorber, the heat load can be approximated by
assuming that the volatile fission products from the fluorinator accumulate
for 5 days and that those first accumulated will decay or cool as additional
accumulation occurs. A table can be prepared for accumulated heat genera-
tion rate, derived from the residence time of fission products in the

sorber:

Sodium Fluoride Waste Containers

The NaF waste tanks accumulate NaF and fission products from the
sorbers. Each tank holds two complete bottom sorber zones from each of
two sorbers (10 days’! accumulation of fission products in. one day incre -

ments). These zones exhaust to the NeF waste tank each day for 10 days.

. According to the slope of the fission -product decay heat curve (Figs. 2a

and b), the average residence time of the fission products, and the average
heat generation rate of the NaF bed material as it leaves the sorber, the
following heat generation rate exists in the NeF waste tank at the end of
10 days, at which time it is. full.

Interim-Storage of Waste

As mentioned above, the waste containers are to be cooled for a
minimum of 80 days by forced air convection prior to their transfer to
the interim waste storage facility. The average heat generation rate of
one container at the end of this time (based on the slope of the fission-
product decay heat for this period) will be 104,000 Btu/nr.

An average of 28 containers are to be sent to this waste-storage

facility per year at one-month intervals — an average of 2.33 containers

per month. When the cell is opened for transfer, the most recently

filled container has 80-day-old material in it,’ whereas, the first filled
is about 110 days old. On the average, the heat generating rate of the

transferred containers is characteristic of one that is 95 days old whose

rate is 87, 500 Btu/hr. The average heat generation rate of containers sent
to the interim storage facility is:
2.33 x 87,500 = 203,900 Btu/hr .
The heat generation rate of these containers decays with storage

time, and the average rate in the interim facility for one year's

: accumulation is:

APPENDIX C. ESTIMATION OF DISTILLATION
RATE IN VACUUM STILL

Here, calculations are piven whereby the distillation rate of the

vacuum still is estimated. The configuration of the still is shown in °

Fig. 9 of the text. The calculational method used is a modification of

~ the procedure for calculating the rate in molecular distillation as given
by Burrows. 10 For our still, it is estimated that at 1000°C and at a ©

pressure of 1 mm of Hg, the distillation rates for LiF and BeF
respectively, 3.32 x 10 -3 and 2.02 x 10 -3 g sec Ll em
For molecular distillation, a still is designed so that its condensing

surface is located quite close to its evaporating surface, thereby

5 are,

minimizing the transport distance for the vapor. If the separation

distance is small enough and if the pressure is low enough, a molecule
leaving the liquid surface has a very high probability of reaching the
condenser without colliding with another molecule. This is the essence

of molecular distillation. Our still cannot be described precisely as a

molecular still because its operating pressure is too high; however, the

pressure is low enough that conditions for molecular distillation are
approached. For this reason, the calculational methods of molecular
distillation, modified to apply to pressures slightly higher than those
for true molecular distillation, are used here to estimate the distillation
rate for our still.

The theoretical rate of distillation of a single substance for such
conditions can be derived from the kinetic theory of gases, shown by Burrows

5.83 x 10 » [Tr e sec™ om EE (c-1)
where Pm is the equilibrium vapor pressure in mm of Hg, M 1s the molecular
weight in grams, and T is the absolute temperature in °K. The resulting
distillation rate is expressed as g sec “1 cm |

The actual rate of distillation at low pressure will he less than the
theoretical rate because there will be collisions in the vapor space.
Burrows developed an expression for the factor by which the theoretical °

- distillation rate should be multiplied to get the actual rate. Summarizing,

his treatment considers three events that can occur to the molecule in the

vapor space:

Some molecules can reach the condenser without & collision; this

fraction is eX, where K is a dimensionless factor depending upon

the distance between evaporator and condenser, the equilibrium

mean free path of the molecules, and the shape of the evaporating

surface.

The fraction of molecules that collide is s (1 eX ), and the
fraction of these molecules that reach the condenser is (1 -e”
approximately.

From purely geometrical considerations, the probability of a
molecule's striking the condenser after many collisions, which
result in random motion, is a factor F, the ratio of condenser
area to condenser area plus evaporator area. The fraction of.
these molecules that reach the condenser after many collisions
is F(1 - eX)(1 - eX).

In processing the fuel stream of the MSER, distillation must treat a
multicomponent mixture of LiF -BeF,, UF) -fission products. However, LiF and

BeF, constitute more than 99 mole % of the mixture, as shown 'in Table C-l,

making it possible to treat ‘the mixture as a binary solution for purposes

of calculating the distillation rate.

the distillation rate, becomes:

A more rigorous representation of Eq. (e-7) would include the activity
coefficient 141 of component 1 instead of the evaporation coefficient f to
account for deviations from ideality. However, the activity coefficients
are not known for these salt solutions, so for this study it will be assumed
that Eq. (c-1) gives a reasonably valid estimate of the distillation rate.

Since the still operates at constant volume, a material balance

requires that Bef, and LiF distill at the same rate at which they enter
the still. The vapor composition is therefore about 69-31 mole % LiF -BeF,,
the same as it is in the stream entering the still. If the total pressure
in the vapor space of the still is kept at 1 mm Hg, the partial pressures
of LiF and BeF, are 0.69 and 0.31 mm Hg, respectively, assuming that there

APPENDIX D. FISSION-PRODUCT ACCUMULATION AND HEAT GENERATION
RATE IN LITHIUM FLUORIDE POOL.IN VACUUM STILL

Nonvolatile fission products accumulate in the vacuum still as the

LiF -BeF, fuel carrier and volatile fission products are distilled away.

2

‘The still is initially charged with b £3 of makeup Tri, evacuated to a

pressure of 1 mm Hg or less and adjusted to a temperature of about 1000°C.
Fluorinated fuel salt, containing fission products, is allowed to flow

“continuously into the pool of LiF, and the still is operated so that the

rate of distillation is exactly equal ‘to the feed rate. There is no bottom i
discharge, and the volume remains constant. Kelly! 8 work 25 showed that the
5 distillate is decontaminated by a factor of 100 to

1000 from rare earths. Operation is continued at the above pressure and

temperature until one of two phenomens, forces termination: (1) Either the

solubility of fission products in the 4 £43 of LiF is exceeded and trouble -
some precipitation occurs, or (2) the sccumulated heat generation rate from
£1ssion-product decay begins to tax the capacity of the cooling system.
When the distillation is terminated, the LiF~fission-product residue in the
still is drained to a waste receiver and eventually to permanent storage.
The operating cycle is then repeated.

The aim of the following calculations is to determine the operating

~ cycle for the still and the limiting conditions for the design shown in

Fig. 9. Since one design criterion is to process the fuel stream with
minimum but -of -reactor holdup, and since the solubility of the rare earths
in LiF at 1000°C is about 50 mole %, it is apparent that condition (2)

Ss above will be controlling. Decay -heat removal will be a serious’ problem
‘long before solubility limits are approached. It has been determined that
_ the bt still can operate continuously for about 67.4 days at a distilla-
tion rate of 15 ft7/day, processing fuel that has the heat generation

characteristics shown in Figs. 2a and b of the text. The significance of

this ‘number is that it represents the rate of Tra discard to waste - 116 kg

every 67. 4 days. The heat. generation rate at this time is 31: x 10° Btu/hr,

the maximum that can be removed by the cooling system.

The calculations below are believed to give a conservative estimate

- of the still performance. The basic data on fission -product heat generation

versus decay time represent gross values and hence do not exclude the
contributions of those fission products removed by the reactor gas sparge,
by deposition on metal surfaces in the reactor system, or by the fluorins-
tion step in chemical processing. Furthermore, the 15-£t3 day design rate
is probably excessive for a 1000-Mw (electrical) MSER; the economic optimum
rate is perhaps nearer 12 £43 /asy. Also, no credit was taken for periodic
interruptions in processing due to the reactor's operating at less than
100% plant factor. All these factors tended to shorten the still operating
cycle and increase the discard cost. |

The calculations are arranged as follows: First, an analytical
expression is derived for the heat generation rate of fission products
in the still as a function of elapsed time since discharge from the

reactor. Second, this equation is then used to evaluate the still design.
Analytical Expression for Heat Generation Rate

When irradiated fuel salt is discharged from the fluorinator, it has
been out of the reactor about 38 hr. A cooling tank downstream from the
fluorinator adds another 24 hr of holdup, so that the salt is about 62 hr
old when it reaches the still. The heat generation characteristics of
the salt during this period were calculated by assuming an infinitely
mixed system; these calculations are described in Appendix A, and the
results are shown graphically in Fig. A-l1. Continuous operation is
assumed throughout the system, and, by the time the fuel reaches the
still, its heat generation (Fig. A-1) is about 4.45 x 10° Btu hr £173.

The still is a sink for fission products that exhibit decay behavior
like that shown in Fig. 2a and b. Initially at t = 62 hr = 2.58 days,
the Lb £43 of LiF in the still is fresh material having a zero heat genera-
tion rate, but this condition changes rapidly when the still is put on-
stream. Flow into the still is continuous, and the rate of heat generation
will rise until flow is stopped. The magnitude of this rate at any future
time T is therefore an integrated quantity over the accumulation period:
"t_= 2.58 days to T. To describe the behavior of the still during this

0
period, define the quantities

Evaluation of Vacuum-Still Design

Two principal conditions had to be satisfied in the still design: |
(1) the evaporating surface had to be sufficient for obtaining the required
15-043 /day distillation rate, and (2) maximum heat transfer surface had to
be provided to minimize the frequency with which the still is drained to
the waste tank. The choice of dimensions was somewhat arbitrary; a tube-
sheet diameter of 2.5 ft was chosen because it gave an evaporating surface
that was about 2.5 times the calculated ares, and a closely spaced arrange-
ment of 2.5-ft-long by 1/2-in. diem tubes was used for high cooling-surface-
to-volume ratio. The primary unknown operating condition is the length of
time that fission products cen be accumulated before the Integrated heat
generation taxes the capacity of the cooling system; en estimate of this
time is determined in the following calculations. The schematic diagram
in'Fig. D-3 depicts the still operation end summarizes calculated performence
and physical data. |

The calculations vhich are described below indicate that the still
can accumulate fission products for sbout 67.4 days in a 4-13 LiF pool
when the still is operated continuously at a feed rate of 15 £43 /aay. The
discard rate for LiF is therefore a very small fraction of the processing
rate, being about 0.4%. As mentioned above, the heat generation rate
predicted by Eq. (p-8) is probably excessive because gross instead of net

fission-product data were used; therefore this accumulation time can be

“treated ‘as & lower limit.

Heat Transfer Characteristics :

 

The 1000 °c “temperature of the LiF pool in the still was chosen to
achieve adequate distillation rate and fission-product solubility. The
pool transfers heat to ‘the “tube walls by natural convection, and this heat
is picked up on the outside of the tubes by NeK (22.3-77.7 mole % Na-K

eutectic) under forced convection. The NeK coolent enters the still at

of 340°C (612°F). Heat transfer characteristics of LiF were calculated by ’
using the Nusselt equation for natural convection, in conjunction with the
physical-property data given in Appendix F. A Nusselt-type equation for
flow normal to banks of tubes was used for calculating the heat transfer

properties of the coolant. Since the total heat dissipation requirement

of the still was unknown (because fission-product accumulation time wes

not known), the ‘coolant heat transfer coefficient was expressed as a
function of the heat generation rate. It was determined that the still
could dissipate about 31 x 10° Btu/hr for the NaK flow conditions shown

in Fig. D-3. The overall heat transfer coefficient for maximum heat flux

is about 190 Btu hrt £2 opL, From Fig. D-2, the time after discharge

" from the reactor corresponding to the above integrated heat generation is

TO days. The fission-product accumulation time is 2.58 days less or 67.4
days because of the time lag before fuel reaches the distillation step.

LiF, BeF,, UF), end Fission-Product Discard Rates. — At the end of

the 67.4-day cycle, the still contents are primarily LiF. and fission

products. The equilibrium Ber, concentration was estimated sbove to be
only 0.4 mole % because of its relatively high vapor pressure at 1000°C.
If it is assumed that the fluorination step is 99. % efficient for uranium
removal, then in 67.4 days about 3. 64 kg of U will have entered the still.
Uranium tetrafluoride has a vapor pressure at 1000°C about 2. 3 times that
of LiF, so & portion of ‘the uF), will be recovered in the distillate. The.

amount recovered cannot be calculated until more ‘is known about the vapor-

liquid equilibria of multicomponent molten salt mixtures. Fission-product

- accumulation during this period is approximately 190.1 kg; most of the RbF
‘and CsF of this inventory will distill because of relatively high vapor

pressures.

An estimate of the inventory relegated to waste every 67.4 days is
given in Table D-1. A reactor plant-factor of 100% was assumed in the

calculation. These values are based on ideal -solution behavior, particularly
“with regard to LiF and BeF,; this is almost surely not the case for this

mixture. As more is learned about the activities of the components, it can
be expected that the compositions of Table D-1 will be different from those

APPENDIX E. DESIGN CALCULATIONS FOR WASTE -STORAGE SYSTEM

Separate storage is provided for fuel and fertile stream wastes as
fluorides in underground tanks designed for bulk accumulation over a 30-
year period. Waste management in the post-30-year period was not con-
sidered in this study. However, as mentioned in the text (see Table 2),
it will probably be desirable to reprocess the fertile-stream waste, which
is only mildly radioactive, at some future time for recovery of thorium,
lithium, and uranium values. About 116 kg of 233y will be present. Fission
products, separated in this recovery, could be stored longer, depending on
the activity. | oo

"In the fuel-stream waste, the only significant value, other than the

possible future value of individual fission products, is TL. However, as

“explained below, it is necessary to add a mixture of NaF -KF to this waste
“to facilitate heat transfer. Since these compounds are chemically similar

to LiF, recovery of the lithium is difficult. In any event, at the end of
the 30-year period, the desirability of recovery would have to be analyzed

~in light of the prevailing costs.

Two basic problems must be solved in designing the waste storage
system: (1) the integrated rate of heat generation by fission-product
decay must be determined, and (2), using the results of (1), the most
economic design for the prevailing conditions must be found. The heat
generation rate is computed from the fission -product. decay behavior
exhibited in Figs. 2a and b (see text), and the results are shown in
Figs. E~1 and E22. A previous study by Carter and Ruch examined a

similar waste-storage problem, and, in accord with their recommendation

‘for economic waste management, bulk storage in large, heat-exchanger’ tanks

- is adopted for our wastes. Conceptual designs of the waste facilities are

shown on Dwgs. 58080 D and 58081 C in Appendix F.
Over the 30-year period, 784 £43 of fuel -stream vaste i are collected.

This volume includes 520 £13 of LiF-fission -product mixture drained from
the processing cell, plus 284 £t> of NaF KF diluent. The storage tank is
‘16 ft in diemeter and 6.33 ft ‘high. The corresponding volume of fertile-
stream waste is 1783 £13; this is stored in a tank 13.5 ft in diameter by
. 13.5 £4 high.

Most of the following calculations are concerned with the design of
the waste tank for fuel -stream effluent because the most difficult design
problems occur for this waste. After the decay characteristics of the
fission products and integrated heat generation rate are determined, the
calculations examine, in the following order, the basic features of tank
design, maximum allowable heat generation rate, volume of diluent, waste-
tank design, and the underground storage facility. Once these calculations

are made, computations for the fertile-stream waste are almost incidental.
Fuel Stream Waste System

Decay Characteristics of the Fission Products

The initial problem in designing the waste tank is to determine the
decay in terms of the time -related characteristics of the salt being added
to the tank. That is to say, the still bottoms, which represent an accumuls -
tion of fission products having ages in the range 2.58 to 70 days, generate
heat at a rate characteristic of fission products having an "average" age
somevhere between these values. The time -related behavior of the integrated,
specific heat generation rate is shown in Fig. 11 of the text for the case
of no inert salt dilution. The graph covers a 5-year collection period of
b£t3 batches every 67.4 days. The initial point on the graph begins at
about 140 days; this is the accumulated time in the processing plant with a
reference time of zero taken as the day the fuel is discharged from the
reactor. An in-cell delay period of 67.4 days after removal from the still
is included in this time to permit some initial cooling before draining to
the underground tank. -

The decay curves of Figs. 2a and b can be used to determine the decay
behavior when this "average" age has been found. The volume of fuel salt

from which fission products have accumulated is:

15 £t3/day x 67.1 days = 1011 £t3 .
It was determined in Appendix D that the heat generation rate at age equal’
to 70 days out of the reactor is 31 x 10° Btu/hr. Therefore on the basis
of unit volume of core salt the average heat generation rate is:

If tov lies in the range 2 to 10 days, then its value can be found directly
from Eq. (E-4) by utilizing k = 6.69 x 10 and n = 0.43 from Eq. (E-5).
However, if ove is in the range 10 to 20 days, Eq. (E-4) contains a second
term in the numerator involving the constants k = 9.686 x 10 and n = 0.59
of Eq. (E6). Similarly for ove in the range 20 to 100 days, the numerator
of Eq. (E-4) contains a third term involving the constants of Eq. (E-T).

The solution is easily determined by trial, and for this case the proper

form of Eq. (E-4) contains the constants k and n from Eqs. (E-5) and (E-6):

" The solution to this equation is: Tove = 11.6 asys. An average age near
the lower ‘end of the time scale would be expected because of the larger
contribution by the "younger" fission products to heat generation. The

Integrated Heat Generation in Waste Tank

When the vacuum still is taken off stream and drained, its hort
volume is generating heat at 31 x 10° Btu/hr, but this rate is decreasing
in a manner characteristic of 11.6-day-old fission products, as shown on
Fig. 2b. At this point, the change in rate is rather rapid, indicating
that a short delay time in the cell before draining to underground storage .
will appreciably alleviate design requirements for the large tank.
Installation of a second hoft3

is a convenient way of providing a 67.4-day holdup, during this time the

vessel quite similar to the vacuum still

heat generation rate decreases by a factor of about 4.5.

A decay curve was calculated for a typical batch of still residue by
assuming that the curve was parallel to the decay curve of Fig. 2b for MSBR
fission products after 11.6 days. The 67.4-day in-cell delay makes the

accumulated time from reactor discharge to underground storage equal to
 

- 103 -

137.4 days; at this time the heat generation rate of the 4-rt3 batch is

6.8 x 10° Btu/hr. The curves of Fig. E-l are plotted to show the thermsl
history of the underground waste tank over 8 5-year collection period
during which 27 batches are added; also the decay in the post-b5-year
collection period is shown. The curve with positive slope represents the
buildup of heat generation rate from all batches accumulated up to the
indicated time. This curve is actually a stepped curve, but for convenience
it has been drawn smooth through the maximum point of each step. The waste
tank is designed for 30 years' collection, and the accumulated heat genera -
tion at this time can be obtained with little error by extrapolating the
positive -sloped curve of Fig. E-1.

Figure E-2 has been included to show the integrated heat generation
rate in the underground waste tank when the still residue is drained into
the tenk immediately upon completion of the distillation cycle.

Figures E-1 and E-2 represent an upper limit for fission -product heat
generation. As pointed out earlier in this report, the values are for
gross fission-product decay, which includes nuclides that have been removed
‘prior to vacuum distillation. Also the curves were calculated for a
reactor plant factor of 100%. |

Basic Features of Tank Design

A previous study” showed, that bulk storage in large tanks is the most
economical management for fluoride wastes. A 30-year period was chosen
because it coincided with the amortization period of the reactor plant, and
a single tank is sufficient because the overall waste volume is small. For
economy and reliability, cooling by forced air draft was adopted, and an
upper limit of 60 ft/sec was assigned to the velocity. Waste temperature
in the tank is not to: exceed 750 %. i;

Meximun Allowable Heat Generation Rate
Under the above ground rules it is apparent that there is an upper
limit that can be tolerated for the volumetric heat production rate, and

that the waste will have to be diluted to wet sufficient cooling surface.
In 30 years at 80% reactor plant factor there will be 520 £43 of radioactive

Fig. E-2. Decay Curves for Fuel -Stream Fission Products Sent to Waste
Tank Without Prior Cooling. When the still bottoms are drained directly ‘to
the underground waste tank, the total heat generation rate is about 2.8
times that shown on Fig. E-l, in which a 67.4-day cooling is allowed. -
~ cycle time and power of the reactor is the same as for Fig. E-l.

The

waste salt accumulated whose heat generation rate is about 1.76 x 107 Btu/hr,
obtained by extrapolating the upper curve of Fig. E-1. Allowing the coolant

to undergo a temperature rise of 125°C, the air requirement is:

 

°F 1 5
1.76 x 107 Bt x 1b x = 3.13 x 10° lb/hr .
hr © 0.25 Btu (1.8)(125)°F

This is equivalent to 85,190 £43 /min at an average temperature of 87°C.

The required cross section for air flow is:

85,190 ft _ sec _ 2
50 sec X Bo TEC 23 T It.

This area can be obtained with 894 tubes 2.5 in. in diameter, with a 9-gage
wall; in the final design, Drawing 58080 D, Appendix F, 937 tubes were used.
These tubes, arranged in a U-tube configuration, can be accommodated in a
16 -ft-diem tank.

Waste salt is stored on the shell side in the tank. The available
volume per foot of tank is: | |

The heat transfer surface per foot of tank height is:

Therefore, the surface available to each cubic foot of waste is 7.88 £t°/£t3.

The mean temperature difference between coolant and salt is 651°¢, and
the overall heat transfer coefficient is estimated to be 6.2 Btu nr £12

Volume of Diluent

of individual batch volumes from the process plus the required diluent.

is carried out over N batches. ‘The above paragraph shows that the total

The required diluent volume for each batch can now be determined by solving

 

at) __ 3 rv) :
5.75 x 10° r=1

The value of q(t) corresponding to the nth patch is read from Fig. E-1.

It is apparent that the largest diluent volume is required when the
first batch is drained to the waste tank. Eventually the tank contains
sufficient volume so that no further inert diluent is required. This
behavior is shown on Fig. E-3. The total volume of diluent is 26.4 £3,
making the. 30-year volume of waste plus diluent equal to 78k £3. In
actual practice, the total diluent volume would probably be added at the

beginning of waste collection rather than in discrete steps, as shown in

Waste Tank Design

The 937 U-tubes are installed in the tank with ‘one end open to the
interior of the vault, and the other end welded into an exhaust duct

- leading to the stack. Air forced into the vault passes over the outside
© of the vant before entering the U-tubes. This design provides about

6100 £2 of tube cooling surface, which is about 2.5 times the calculated

requirement. The relatively large number of tubes and the small waste
volume lead to & tank that has a low height -to-diameter ratio. The tank
is 16 ft in diameter and 6. 33 ft high end has a storage volume of about
860 £13. Monel was chosen as the structural material.

 

Underground Storage Facility

The underground storage area 1s shown on Drawing 58080-D, Appendix F.
In addition to the vault for the fuel -stream waste tank; the area contains
& storage vault for solid NaF and MgF, wastes from the We sorption step.
The design of this portion of the waste system is discussed in Appendix B.

Fertile Stream Waste System

Design bases used for fertile -stream waste -storage were:

1. Thirty-year accumulation in a single waste tank.

2. Fertile stream power of 62 Mw (thermal).

3. Only one blenket volume (1783 ft3) discarded in 30 years.
Lk. Fission-product heat generation as shown on Figs. 3a and b.
5. Cooling by natural air convection.

It was estimated that the integrated heat generation rate at the end of the
30-year filling period would be only 5.9 x 10% Btu/hr, and, if the storage
temperature is allowed to be as high as 900°F, this heat can be dissipated
by about LO £t2 of cooling surface. Therefore it is only necessary to

place cooling surfaces over the tank cross section in locations .that shorten
the path for heat conduction through the salt. Twelve U-in.-diam pipes
equally spaced over the cross section are provided to remove internal heat.
Regions of salt most distant from a cooling surface might be molten during
some period .in tank lifetime, but this will not present a corrosion problem

because cooling surfaces will always be covered with a frozen salt layer.

The storage tank is 13. 5 ft in diemeter and 13.5 ft high, providing
about 1900 £43 of storage volume. Stainless steel can be used in the
construction because only occasionally will molten LiF -ThF) -fission product
mixture contact a metal surface. The tank is contained in an underground

concrete vault as shown on Drawing 58081-C, Appendix F.
