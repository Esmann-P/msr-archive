SUMMARY

Theoretical laminar flow analyses are given for free convection in fluids
having a uniform volume heat source and for both parallel plate and cylindrical
Pipe geometries The solutions are intended to be valid in the central region
(vertically) of channels having small diameters and large lengths, that 1s, the
solutions do not apply to short systems or near the ends of long systems where
the velocity and temperature profiles are not yet fully established In addi-
tion, the solutions are restricted to systems in which the long axis 1s vertical
and 1m which the walls are uniformly cooled by a forced flow coolant flowing
vertically upward parallel to the long axis of the system

Solutions are obtained for the parallel plate geometry by two different
techniques called exact and approximate! In the "exact method the differ-
ential equations for velocity and for temperature, which are interdependent
in free convection systems, are solved simultaneously, in the 'approximate"
method the form of the velocity distribution 1s postulated and substituted in
the temperature equation which 1s then integrated Solutions by the two methods
agree well in the range where the basic postulates are believed to be valid
The velocity and temperature structures are functions of two new dimensionless

moduli herein designated as Ny and Nyp
INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this report 1s to provide a wider distribution for three
analyses performed in 1951 than was accomplished by the very limited local
distribution of References 1, 2, and 3 Originally these analyses were per-
formed as the first step in a theoretical-experimental free convection research
program At that time 1t was planned to withhold publication of these analyses
as a report until the experimental data were available which proved their
validity Subsequently, other problems have diverted attention from free
convection experiments so that this research has become a part time activity
(Reference 4) This reduced experimental program 1s less comprehensive than
would be required to adequately prove or disprove the validity of the basic
assumption of these analyses Therefore the reason for delaying this publa-
cation 1s no longer valid It 1s expected that the results of the more modest
experimental program will be reported in the near future

The basic postulates that apply to all three analyses are discussed in the
next section, following that is the ‘exact"” solution (Ideal System I) for the
parallel plate geometry Then an approximate solution (Ideal System II) for
the parallel plate geometry 1s presented Finally, an "approximate' solution
(Ideal System III) for the cylindrical pipe geometry 1s given which is the

cylindrical equivalent of Ideal System II

GENERAL DISCUSSION OF THE PROBLEM

Laminar flow free convection systems are described by three equations of
motion (Navier Stokes equations) and the heat conduction equation for a moving
system These four partial differential equations are interdependent and com-
prise a set one would hardly attempt to solve It 1s intended here to briefly
discuss the basic postulates that permit simplification of these equations to the
quite elementary ordinary differential equations that are solved in this report
Although the parallel plate or cartesian geometry of Figure 1 is used in thas
discussion the comments are equally applicable to the cylindrical pipe geometry

The free convection system to be studied 1s the fluid in the channel between
the parallel plates (Figure 1) separated by a distance, d, and of height, h,
which 1s very long compared to 4 Heat is generated uniformly throughout the
fluid and the heat 1s removed uniformly at the walls Because of these factors
and because of the vertical orientation of the z axis there will be three
parallel free convection fluid streams, the warm stream in the center of the
channel will flow up and the two cool streams near the walls will flow down
Below some critical velocity these streams should be quite stable and, in
Tact, should behave much as three laminar forced flow streams separated by
Physical boundaries might behave This tendency toward stability of the flows
suggests that the flow would be one long vertical cell, not a number of small
cells or leminar eddies a few diameters in length In forced flow heat transfer

systems in conduits the velocity and temperature distributions are observed to

become fully established or reach a stable form some diameters beyond the entrance

Beyond this entrance region the velocity and temperature distributions no longer

change as one proceeds down the pipe The similarity of the flow in the free

convection system and the forced flow system above suggests that beyond some

entrance region, near the ends of the present system, the velocity and tempera-

ture profiles may also become fully established These are the two basic

postulates of the systems analysed in this report and are stated more incisively

as follows

Postulate 1

Postulate 2

w = f(x)
& = A, where A 1s a positive constant and
z

uniform for the entire system

Other postulates that are necessary to describe the three ideal systems

to be analysed are

Postulate 3

Postulate kh

Postulate 5

Postulate 6

Postulate 7

Postulate 8

The volume heat source term, q'', is uniform
throughout the system and constant with time

The height to diameter ratio, h/d, is very large
The flow 1s laminar and steady (1 e , constant
with time)

The flow 1s two dimensional (1 e , the y component
of velocity, v, 1s zero)

All fluid properties except density are constants
The density 1s constant in the heat equation and is
a linear function of temperature in the dynamic

equation
- 13 -

As a consequence of Postulate 1 one can prove that the x component of
velocity, u, and the transverse pressure gradient £2 vemsh and that os
x z
18 uniform with x Thus, two of the dynamic equations are eliminated and the

third is greatly simplified to

ew g(a
p(B g) &

As a result of Postulate 2 one can prove that the heat flux at the wall
is uniform and therefore known, that is, each element of width, 4, and height,
dz, loses through its own bounding wall surface exactly the amount of heat
generated within that element Thus, no net heat loss occurs in the z direction
for such an element An additional consequence of Postulate 2 is that the use
of the temperature function, &, eliminates z as a variable and the equations

involve only one independent variable, x The heat conduction equation 1s then

simplified to

i _ A "
5" ZV - 5 (2)
By definition p(t) = p(t,) (2-8 - £5) (3)

Employing the function, &, and Equation (3), Equation (1) becomes

Note that the function Bj(z) is independent of x

The boundary conditions and auxiliary information that go with the
differential equations to complete the boundary value problem are given here

Due to the definition of the temperature function ¢

o(1) = 0 (9)

It is evident from inspection thet both the velocity and temperature

functions are symmetrical, thus

No net heat transfer occurs in the z direction so the heat generated at a

given level must transfer to the walls at that level, thus

equations and boundary conditions were adequately discussed in the previous
section It is sufficient here to define the system mathematically and then to

Velocity Solution
Eliminating the temperature from Equations (5) and (6) one gets the

velocity equation

By successive application of boundary conditions (10p), (12), and (13p) one

 

obtains

Thus, the velocity solution, plotted in Figure 2, 1s given by

The critical value of Rey above which the flow 1s no longer laminar must be
determined by experiment Experiments in Reference (5) indicated that the
critical value of Reynolds modulus for non-isothermal flow varies in a very com-

plex manner and 1s not the same as for the isothermal flow case

Temperature Solution

 

At least three methods may be used to obtain the temperature solution, the
method employed here 18 to substitute the velocity from Equation {16a) into the

temperature Equation (5) and integrate using the boundary conditions (9) and

IDEAL, SYSTEM II (PARALIEL PLATES - APPROXIMATE)

 

This solution is an approximate method for obtaining an answer to the
problem described by Ideal System I If the two solutions agree satisfactorily
the approximate" method offers the two advantages of presenting a less diffi-
cult boundary value problem and of requiring less time to perform the numerical
calculations The technique depends upon the judicious postulation of the form

of the velocity distribution to be substituted into Equation (5)

Velocity Solution

Let the real flow system of Ideal System I be replaced by a counter-current
heat exchanger system such as that depicted in Figure 5 To emphasize the
method used, the X coordinate 1s replaced by the coordinate, M, in the hot upward
flowing stream, and by the coordinate, S, in the cold, downward flowing stream
One can think of these streams as separated by parallel plates inserted at
+X; (or M = + 1) The velocity distribution in each region 1s given by the
equations with Figure 5, this 1s the familar parabolic expression for established
isothermal, laminar, forced flow between parallel plates Since there 1s no net
flow

The excellent agreement of Ideal Systems I and II for values of Ny up
to 10% supports the validity of the approximate method Since the solution to
be presented here is identical with Ideal System II, except for geometry, the
accompanying discussion will be reduced to a minimum The "exact' solution of
Equations (7) and (8) is not difficult, 1t 1s an uncommon form of Bessel's
equation The disadvantage of the exact' solution in this case is the labor

involved in the numerical calculations of the solutions

Velocity Solution

The postulated velocity distribution given in Figure 7 was obtained in the
same manner as was used in Ideal System II, in this case the two regions are
dynamically characteristic of isothermal, laminar, established forced flow in a
pipe (for the hot stream) and in a circular annulus (for the cold stream)

Since there 1s no net flow
Yh R,2 = we(l - R,2) (38)
To satisfy static equilibrium at the interface

du (Ry-)_ du(Ra+) (39)

Equations (38) and (39) require that

DISCUSSION

In the range where the basic postulates are believed to be valid, that is,
for O<KN1< 10% » the approximate method, Ideal System II, and the exact method,
Ideal System I, yield temperature solutions that are in good agreement Up to
Ny equal to 109 the two velocity distributions are in close agreement so that one
1s not surprised at the good agreement of the temperature solutions in this range
Above Ny equal to 107 the value of Xx, in the exact solution becomes greater, that
1s, the interface between the hot and cold streams moves nearer to the wall

I

Above a value of Ny of 10" the difference in velocity structure 1s sufficient to
cause a marked difference in the two temperature solutions It 1s interesting
that the approximate solution 1s always in error by giving a temperature that 1s
too high

For the systems analyzed here, 1t appears that the reduction in tempera-
ture due to laminar free convection is of the order of one half

Some of the postulates upon which these analyses are based must yet be

verified by free convection experiments in volume heat source channel systems
