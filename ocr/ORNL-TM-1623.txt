ABSTRACT

oo Various filter and adsorbent materials were examined for

CE
Ja

A controlled flow of oil was injected into a heated nickel reaction
vessel to cause vaporization’ ‘and some cracking of the oil. ‘Helium

flowing through the reaction vessel carried the oil mist and hydro-

“carbon. ‘vapor through a filter system. Filter effectiveness was
determined by the use of a Perkin-Elmer Hydrocarbon Detector, oe
gravimetric analysis, ‘and gas chromatographic analysis. Good

 

removal of mists was achieved by the use of a combination of BN

 

adsorption isotherms for this material.

1. INTRODUCTION

C
x) 8 CN

One of the problems encountered during the early stages
of power operation of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment was
that some valves and filters in the off-gas systen became
plugged. The plugs were analyzed and found to be of organic
composition.

One possible source of organic material was the oil used
to lubricate the salt circulating pump. If indeed the pump
were leaking oil into the pump bowl, the maximum credible
leakage would be in the range of 15 to 20 cc per day.

This experiment was designed to simulate the consequences
of this maximum expected oil leakage and to test various
filter and adsorbent materials for removal of oil mist and

hydrocarbon vapors under these conditions. «©

2. PROCEDURE
A complete flow diagram of the apparatus is shown in Co —
Fig. 1 and a picture as Fig. la.
Gulfspin-35 oil is used to lubricate the Molten Salt |
Reactor pump; this same oil was used in our experiments. The
oil was injected by a motor driven syringe connected by a
capillary tube to a heated reaction vessel. The injection
rate was 0.67 A hour. | B
Simulating MSRE off-gas flow conditions, helium was
passed through the system at 4 liters per minute. The nickel
reaction vessel temperature was about 600°C.

passed through two, charcoal traps filled with PCB 6X16

charcoal. A Perkin-Elmer 213 Hydrocarbon Detector, provided

by the Analytical Chemistry Division, was used to measure the

hydrocarbon levels at three positions (8-1, s-2, s-3) shown on

the flow diagram. Gas samples were taken periodically at these

same three positions for subsequent chromatographic analysis.
Pressure drop measurements were made using Hg and H,0

manometers. Readings were taken each half hour.

3. OIL MIST FILTERS
3.1. General Description
Limited time necessitated that the investigation of
filter materials be confined to those easily obtainable.

Materials tested were coarse nickel wool, Supreme #1 steel

.wool, Supreme #00 steel wool, Pyrex glass wool, Fiberfrax

and a M-S-A air line Ultra Filter.

Fiberfrax showed an appreciable pressure drop when packed
into the glass U-tube traps. This was thie short fiber variety
which packed very tightly when loading the traps. Because the
pressure drop was in excess of 8 psig, this material was not
tested. However, long fiber Fiberfrax proved to be satisfactory.

3.2. Experimental Data
3.2.1. The first two experiments were performed using
coarse nickel wool in trap A, and Supreme #1 steel wool in

traps B and C. The data summarized in Table 1 show this trap

assembly removed 55% of the total oil injected into the
Table 1.

the oil was probably held up on the walls of exit lines.
3.2.2. Experiment #3 utilized the same coarse nickel

wool in trap A. Traps B and C were filled with Supreme #00

steel wool. Eighty percent of the total oil injected was

removed with these traps.

| 3.2.3. Experiment #4 used coarse nickel wool in trap A
and Pyrex glass wool in traps B and C. Although this run was
of greater duration than previous ones, no increase in weight
was found in trap C. Ninety-one per cent of the oil injected
was removed by this trap assembly.

3.2.4. The following summary indicates the amount of

oil retained per gram of filter material used in experiments

1 through 4.

3.3. Experimental Data After Altering Oil Injection
To obtain better cracking, the 0il entry to the reaction
vessel was altered. In experiments 1 through 4 the oil. entered

at point P as shown on the flow diagram in Fig. 1. This entry

point was changed to point P' so that the oil entered directly

into the stream of flowing helium and down the dip-leg of the

reaction vessel.
Using this method of injection, the hydrocarbon level at

 
 

10

the three analysis points S-1, S-2, and S-3 rose to about
ten times previous levels. Obviously, much less cracking
had occurred in experiments 1 through 4. The average hydro-

carbon levels are summarized below:
-

Expt. # Analysis Analysis - Analysis

l - 4 75 ppm 35 ppm : 22 ppm
5-7 715 ppm 360 ppm 285 ppm

) 3.3.1. Traps for experiments 5, 6A, and 6B contained
Supreme #00 steel wool in trap A, and Pyrex glass wool in
traps B and C. Oil recovery ranged from 68% to 72% for this
trap assembly. More efficient cracking of the oil resulted
in a decreased oil recovery. It should be noted that in each
of these runs only a small portion of the adsorbable oil mist
reached trap C as shown in Table 1.

3.3.2. Experiment 7 investigated the efficiency of a
commercial filter assembly. A M-S-A air line Ultra Filter
as shown in Fig. 2 was used. The particulate filter element
is molded of a cellulose matrix with glass microfibers added
to present a large capturing surface. The cartridge holder
is equipped with a drain plug through which liquids can be
removed periodically. -

The M-S-A filter assembly was installed in our apparatus,
replacing traps A, B, and C. |

This filter assembly was the most efficient filter

4. CHARCOAL TRAP EFFICIENCY

The charcoal traps used in our experiments were 1-in.
I.D. glass Pyrex pipe packed with about 12 inches of PCB
6X16 charcoal.

Under reactor conditions, the decay of fission products
is expected to raise the temperature of a charcoal trap of
the above dimensions to about 100°C. Consequently, charcoal
traps were kept at a temperature of 100°C during our experi-
ments.

| A point of interest was the amount of hydrocarbons
necessary to saturate a known amount of charcoal at 100°C.
Data for this investigation were obtained simultaneously with
the filter material tests previously described.

Charcoal trap #1 shown in Fig. 1 was filled with a known

amount of charcoal. Sample points S-1, S-2, and S-3 were
 

 

wi

aN

C

monitored with the hydrocarbon detector. Saturation was

13

assumed when the hydrocarbon level at S-2 started approaching
the ‘level of S-1. | |
4,1. Charcoal Saturation with Hydrocarbons

Figure 3 summarizes the two experiments carried out.
The first experiment made use of a packed bed of about 3 inches
of charcoal in a Zlass trap. The weight of charcoal was
approximately 6.0 grams per inch. The first evidence of satura-
tion occurred at a total time of 30 hours. A second test with
about 6 inches of charcoal reached saturation in about 60 hours.

The hydrocarbon level at S-1 and S-2 averaged 700 ppm and 425

ppm (CH, eq.) respectively prior to trap saturation.

The 3-in. trap was analyzed after it became saturated
and the results are shown in Table 2. This data indicates
that as the heavier hydrocarbons were more strongly adsorbed

in the top of the trap, the lighter hydrocarbons were forced

--to the bottom. "Breakthrough" occurred when the Ce hydro-

carbons were forced out. Table 3 contains gas samples taken.

| before and after hydrocarbon saturation.

4,2, Temperature Dependence of Hydrocarbon Adsorption
on Charcoal

~ Adsorption of hydrocarbons on the charcoal is a function

of charcoal temperature as shown in Figs. 4 and 5. Upon

cooling charcoal trap #2 from 100°C to 25°C the helium efflu-

ent to the trap was lowered to approximately 40 per cent of

' the original hydrocarbon concentration. Cooling from 100°C

returned to 100°C:after each cooling ¢ycle the hydrocarbon
content rose sharply then returned to its original level.
5. “TESTING OF MSRE PARTICLE FILTER

Traps A, B, and Cc were replaced with a prototype of the
MSRE particle filter shown in Fig. 6. This filter was prepared
by personnel of the Reactor Division. The filter consisted
of two Huyck stainless steel felt metal filters and a chamber
filled with long fiber Fiberfrax. Pressure drop measurements

were made to determine the maximum AP after the felt metal

filters were saturated with oil mist. Measurements were made

using H,0 and Hg manometers.

A further test was performed in which the felt metal
filters were welded inside a stainless steel pipe as shown
in Fig. 7. This assembly was placed inside a tube furnace
and tests were conducted at various temperatures.

i 5.1. Pressure Drop Data

Figure 8 shows the pressure drop data obtained from the

MSRE particle filter test. After 24 hours the pressure

remained constant at 2.7 psig. Attempts to blow the oil off

the felt metal filters, by suddenly increasing the flow rate
of helium to 8 liters/min, were not successful. The AP would
drop slightly, when the flow rate was returned to 4 liters/min,
but returned to its former level in less than 5 minutes.

~The felt metal filters vere removed from the system and a

pressure drop across the Fiberfrax alone was determined. The

pressure drop was 0.012 psig and remained constant over a

20-hr period.’

. 5.2. Pressure Drop Data of Felt Metal at
Elevated Temperatures

A filter ssembly with the coarse and fine felt metal
filters welded in a stainless steel pipe was fabricated as
shown in Fig. 9. . The assembly was placed in a 5-in., tube
furnace. It was desirable to measure the AP of the felt
metal filters at ‘elevated temperatures, since, during reactor
operations, the decay of fission products would possibly
raise the temperature of the filter assembly. |

| Measurements at various temperatures were reproducible
as shown in Fig. 9. However, the maximum AP at 25°C was
0.45 psig compared with 2.7 psig measured in the previous
experiment. |

DopP measurements conducted by the Reactor Division on
the prototype of the MSRE particle filter showed it to be
99.98% efficient. The welded filter assembly, when tested,
was only about 95% efficient.. Although there was no visible
evidence, cracks may have been present in the welds of the
welded filter assembly. ’ |

. Thirty hours at 25°C were required before the felt metal
filters became saturated with oil mist. The transition to the
maximum AP required only about one or two minutes. Upon
reaching maximum AP at room temperature, heat was applied to

the filter assembly. At a temperature of 150°C the AP

decreased sharply, returning almost to the minimum. When the
temperature was raised to 400°C and 600°C the AP rose slightly
in each case but gave no indication of plugging. The rise in
AP associated with a rise in temperature can probably be attrib-
uted to an increase in the’ viscosity of helium. The viscosity
of helium at 25°C is 180 micropoises, and at 600°C is 405
micropoises. “ |

A total of 230 grams of Gulfspin-35 oil was injected into
the heated reaction vessel during the previously described
experiments. Upon termination of the experiments the reaction
vessel was cut apart for visual inspection. The vessel con-
tained 0.5 grams of dry carbon; no evidence of any liquid
hydrocarbons was found. |

The welded felt metal filter assembly was also cut apart;

again no liquid hydrocarbons were found.
