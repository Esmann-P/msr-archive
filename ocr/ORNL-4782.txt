Introduction

The ‘objective of the Molten-Salt Reactor Program is
the development of nuclear reactors which use fluid
fuels that are solutions of fissile and fertile materials in
suitable carrier salts. The program is an outgrowth of
the effort begun over 20 years ago in the Aircraft
Nuclear Propulsion program to make a molten-salt
reactor power plant for aircraft. A molten-salt reactor —

the Aircraft Reactor Experiment — was operated at’

ORNL in 1954 as part of the ANP program.

Our major goal now is. to achieve a thermal breeder
reactor that will produce power at low cost while
simultaneously conserving and extending the nation’s
fuel resources. Fuel for this type of reactor would be
233yF, dissolved in a salt that is a mixture of LiF and
BeF,, but 23°U or plutonium could be used for
startup. The fertile material would be ThF, dissolved
in the same salt or in a separate blanket salt of similar
composition. The technology being developed for the
breeder is also applicable to high-performance converter
reactors. :

A major program activity through 1969 was the
operation of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment. This
reactor was built to test the types of fuels and materials
that would be used in thermal breeder and converter
reactors and to provide experience with operation and
maintenance. The MSRE operated at 1200°F and

Design of the MSRE started in 1960, fabrication of
equipment began in 1962, and the reactor was taken
critical on June 1, 1965. Operation at low power began
in January 1966, and sustained power operation was
begun in December. One run continued for six months,

until terminated on schedule in March 1968.

produced 7.3 MW of heat. The initial fuel contained 0.9

‘mole % UF,, 5% ZrF,, 29% BeF,, and 65% "LiF; the

uranium was about 33% ?35U. The fuel circulated
through a reactor vessel and an external pump and heat
exchange system. Heat produced in the reactor was
transferred to a coolant salt, and the coolant salt was
pumped through a radiator to dissipate the heat to the
atmosphere. All this equipment was constructed of
Hastelloy N, a nickel-molybdenum-iron-chromium
alloy. The reactor core contained an assembly of
graphite moderator bars that were in direct contact

with the fuel.

down permanently December 12, 1969, so that the

ix

Completion of this six-month run brought to a close
the first phase of MSRE operation, in which the
objective was to demonstrate on a small scale the
attractive features and technical feasibility of these
systems for civilian power reactors. We concluded that
this objective had been achieved and that the MSRE
had shown that molten-fluoride reactors can be oper-
ated at 1200°F without corrosive attack on either the
metal or graphite parts of the system, the fuel is stable,
reactor equipment can operate satisfactorily at these
conditions, xenon can be removed rapidly from molten
salts, and, when necessary, the radioactive equipment
can be repaired or replaced.

The second phase of MSRE operation began in
August 1968, when a small facility in the MSRE
building was used to remove the original uranium
charge from the fuel salt by treatment with gaseous F,.
In six days of fluorination, 221 kg of uranium was
removed from the molten salt and loaded onto ab-
sorbers filled with sodium fluoride pellets. The decon-
tamination and recovery of the uranium were very
good. :

After the fuel was processed, a charge of 233U was
added to the original carrier salt, and in October 1968
the MSRE became the world’s first reactor to operate
on 233U. The nuclear characteristics of the MSRE with

‘the 233U were close to the predictions, and the reactor

was quite stable.

In September 1969, small amounts of PuF; were
added to the fuel to obtain some experience with
plutonium in a molten-salt reactor. The MSRE was shut
 

 

 

funds supporting its operation could be used elsewhere

in the research and development program.

Most of the Molten-Salt Reactor Program is now
devoted to the technology needed for future molten-
salt reactors. The program includes conceptual design

studies and work on materials, the chemistry of fuel

and coolant salts, fission product behavior, processing
methods, and the development of components and
systems. :
Because of limitations on the chemical processing
methods available at the time, until three years ago
most of our work on breeder reactors was aimed at
two-fluid systems in which graphite tubes would be
used to separate uranium-bearing fuel salts from

thorium-bearing fertile salts. In late 1967, however, a
one-fluid breeder became feasible because of the devel
opment of processes that use liquid bismuth to isolate
protactinium and remove rare earths from a salt that
also contains thorium. Our studies showed that a
one-fluid breeder based on these processes can have fuel
utilization characteristics approaching those of our
two-fluid designs. Since the graphite serves only as
moderator, the one-fluid reactor is more nearly a
scaleup of the MSRE. These advantages caused us to
change the emphasis of our program from the two-fluid
to the one-fluid breeder; most of our design and
development effort is now directed to the one-fluid
system. ’

Summary

PART 1. MSBR DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
1. Design

The design study of the 300-MW(e) demonstration
reactor plant was completed. The internal structure of
the reactor was developed in considerable detail. Special
attention ‘was given to methods for fabrication and
assembly of the different graphite pieces. Hydraulic
conditions inthe reactor were analyzed and tempera.
tures of graphite were calculated. Cooling equipment
was added to the cell atmosphere circulation systems
that had been provided for heating the reactor equip-
ment cells.

A new analysis of some earlier experiments on the
stripping of iodine from LiF-BeF, melts has shown
that, if one includes the diffusion of 1” in the melt to
the gas-liquid interface as a rate limiting step, there
results a mathematical model which is in accord with
the experimental data. This model permits making an
estimate of what it would take to continually remove
iodine from the MSBR fuel by side-stream processing.

Design studies on the MSBE core were continued,
with emphasis on the design of a slab-type graphite
element. Layout studies of the core include provisions
for four cruciform-shaped control rods. :

A computer program (BUBBLE) has been written to
describe in detail the behavior of gas bubbles circulating
with the salt through the MSBR primary system. This

program is being incorporated into an overall program -

to describe the detailed behavior of noble gases in an
MSBR. :

The MSBR Industrial Design Study Team under
Ebasco Services completed the design report on their
selected 1000-MW(e) reference concept during this
period. Ce

2. Reactor Physics

MSBR lattice physics experiments, performed for us
at Battelle Northwest Laboratories, have been com-.

pleted and reported. In the course of preparing for a
careful analysis of these experiments, we have reviewed
and revised our cross-section library. The revised data
for most nuclides are based on ENDF/B version II.
Exceptions are carbon, lithium, and fluorine, for which
other data are justified. In connection with the lattice
experiments, the problem of calculating neutron reac-
tion rates in a doubly heterogeneous system (coated-
particle fuels in a lumped fuel rod) was studied in
detail. ‘For resonance neutron absorption, conventional
methods of analysis contain conceptual errors, at least
for a laminar system. For random spherical grains, the
conclusion with respect to validity of conventional
methods is not clear, but we found that the grain
effects could be neglected for the small grains used in
our experiment. Our cross-section preparation code,
XSDRN, was modified to treat the grain effects
explicitly in the thermal neutron range.

In connection with the preparation of specifications
for MSR pumps, we calculated the amount of energy
deposited in various parts of a typical MSR pump by
beta and gamma rays from fission products in the salt
and in the cover gas, as well as by neutrons and gammas
from other parts of the primary salt loop.

Reactivity worths of proposed control rods for the
MSBE were calculated. Graphite salt-displacement rods
and poison rods of Hastelloy N, boron in graphite, and
europium in graphite were studied.

In further studies of MSR operation with limited fuel
processing, we calculated initial critical fuel loadings
and fuel compositions as functions of time for various
thorium concentrations with plutonium from light-
water reactors as initial fuel loading and feed. Because
of the high effective absorption cross section in 24°Pu,
it seems desirable to use a low thorium concentration,
for example, 6 mole %, during the initial batch cycle,
when the plutonium concentration is highest, Subse-
quent cycles would use higher thorium concentrations,
for example, 10 mole %, and would burn, primarily,
bred 233U.

 
 

3. Systems and Components Development

The performance and pressure-drop testing of the
GSTF (gas system technology facility) bubble separator
design have been completed on the water test loop. The
final design has a 44-in. separation length, a tapered

casing, and gas removal from both the swirl and

recovery hubs. This design has a suitably high removal

efficiency of the small-diameter bubbles associated with

the 31% CaCl, test fluid and has a stable vortex under

all normal operating conditions.

The pressure-drop measurements of the bubble gener-
ator indicated a larger than expected increase in the
required gas supply pressure as the gas flow was

of the mechanical components are nearing completion,
and the installation of the instruments and electrical
control equipment is imminent. Heat transfer tests, run
with water, on the concentric tube economizer for the
corrosion product cold trap indicate that the tempera-
ture of the salt supply to the cold trap can be lowered a
satisfactory 200°F when the cold trap is operated at a
maximum AT of 100°F.

Detailed assembly procedures were prepared for the
salt pumps to be used in the coolant-salt technology
facility and the gas system test facility. The refurbish-

ment of these pumps is under way. Plans were made to

increased to the design value. Efforts to reduce this

pressure are in progress.

“The bubble formation and coalescence test ig was
assembled and operated. The test results show that
bubbles present in 66-34% LiF-BeF, immediately after
agitation are larger than in the 31% CaCl, solution but
are smaller than in demineralized water. A test capsule
of 72-16-12% LiF-BeF,-ThF, MSR fuel salt contained
suspended material that made observation of bubbles
impossible.

Analyses were started with the objective of idealizing

the swirl-flow bubble separator to develop expressions

which would be helpful in understanding the perfor
mance of this separator. The effect on removal effi-

ciency of the bubble size distribution and the turbulent
diffusion of bubbles away from the vortex cavity are
included in the studies.

The design of most of the components for the GSTF
is nearing completion, and the detailed design of the
facility piping was started. It was determined that the
loop is too closely coupled to permit accurate predic-

restrictors would be required to properly balance the
pressures. The loop will be operated initially with water

obtain confirmation of the performance of the modi-
fied salt pump. The preliminary system design descrip-
tion for the GSTF is ready for publication.

The subcontract with Foster Wheeler Corporation for

. tions of the pressure distributions and that variable flow

to permit calibration of these flow restrictors and to .

a four-task conceptual design study of molten-salt:

steam generators was approved near the end of the
period. After the completion of a surface arrangement
study, Foster Wheeler will proceed with the conceptual

design analysis on the unit of their selection. Task I is

scheduled for completion in October 1972.

The mechanical design of the coolant-salt technology
facility is complete, and the instrument and contro!
design is 90% complete. The fabrication and installation

perform water tests with the salt pump in the gas
system test facility.

The ALPHA pump, equipped with Viton elastomeric
seals in its lower shaft seal, has operated satisfactorily in
the MSR-FCL-2 for approximately 3900 hr. Data on
pump coastdown and lubricating oil flows and tempera-
tures were taken for use in setting operating set points.
The design of several improvements was ‘completed.

The layout and design of 2 small molten-salt mixer for
laboratory use were completed.

4. Instrumentation and Controls

The hybrid computer model of the MSBR system has
been used to investigate thermal transients in the salt
systems for representative perturbations. A report
describing the model and some typical results is being
published.

5. Heat and Mass Transfer and Physical Properties

Heat transfer. Additional determinations of heat
transfer coefficient for a proposed MSBR fuel salt have
been made in the transitional range of Reynolds
modulus (3000—4000) at low inlet fluid temperatures
for which the temperature coefficient of viscosity is a
large negative value [0.2 Ib fi! hr! (CF). In
particular, for operation at Reynolds modulus 3161
without an adiabatic entrance length, the slowly varying
axial gradient in wall temperature downstream from the
heated length suggests the absence of eddy diffusion
and hence that the flow is laminar. The heat transfer
coefficient for this case is well below that predicted by
the Hausen correlation for the transition region. We
attribute the delayed transition to turbulent flow to the
influence of heating a fluid having a negative tempera-
ture coefficient of viscosity.

Wetting studies. The bubble-pressure technique has
been employed to determine the contact angle for the
salt mixture (LiF-BeF,-ThF4-UF,; 67.5-20-12-0.5 mole

i“
 

 

 

 

 

 

xiii

%) on Hastelloy N as a function of time and tempera-
ture. It was found that low-oxygen-content salt (~85
ppm) does not wet a Hastelloy N surface upon initial
exposure at 1000°F, but gradually becomes strongly
wetting. At 1230°F the salt returns to the partial
wetting condition. The increase in wetting with time is
believed to be due to moisture in the helium purge gas
which ‘results in formation of an oxide film on the
surface.

Mass transfer to circulating bubbles. The dependence
of the mass transfer Sherwood modulus for bubbles and
liquids in cocurrent turbulent flow on Reynolds modu-
lus has been examined theoretically for the flow
regimes distinguished by a bubble Reynolds modulus
less than or greater than 2. For the former case the
exponent of the Reynolds modulus is found to be 0.92,
whereas for the latter case the exponent is 0.66. The
experimentally observed value is 0.94. The experi-
mentally determined dependence of the Sherwood
modulus on bubble size is significantly greater than that
predicted for either regime.

PART 2. CHEMISTRY

6. Fission Product Behavior -

The analysis of data from an experimental array
exposed in the MSRE core shows that on paired metal
and graphite surfaces, tellurium and molybdenum were
deposited considerably more strongly on metal than on
graphite. Niobium and ruthenium were less intensely
deposited, favoring metal surfaces only moderately
more than graphite. Such individual characteristics will
have to be considered in anticipating their behavior
under MSBR system conditions.

The presence of superficial grain boundary cracks on
Hastelloy N samples from the MSRE fuel system has
prompted a joint investigation by the Reactor Chemis-
try Division and the Metals and Ceramics Division of
those fission products which might have contributed to

the process. Preliminary tests have exposed specimens

of Hastelloy N, nickel, and type 304L stainless steel to
elemental vapors of tellurium, selenium, sulfur, iodine,

cadmium, arsenic, and antimony at 650°C for 1000- to’

2000-hr periods. Only those specimens of Hastelloy N

that were exposed to tellurium alone showed effects

similar to that found in the MSRE fuel system. Nickel
specimens exposed to tellurium showed much less
severe attack, and all others showed little. if any
deleterious effect.

Tellurium forms the volatile fluorides TeF,; and

TeF¢, both of which are readily reduced to elemental

4

tellurium by UF; (or by stronger reducing agents).
Accordingly, a simple method’for controlled generation
of these materials would permit corrosion testing of
metal specimens in molten-salt mixtures to which
known and controlled additions of tellurium are being

. made. Experimentation has shown that the reaction of

tellurium with anhydrous CoF; affords such a conve-
nient generation method. Reaction of tellurium with
CoF3; when mixed as powders is rapid, but cannot be

~ well controlled. When these reagents are placed in a

compartmented cell, such that they can mix only upon
vaporization of tellurium, TeFg appears as the cell is
heated to 225°C; increasing pressures of TeFg are ob-
served as the temperature is raised to 275°C. A small

‘quantity of TeF, appears in the TeF at 300°C, and no

other vapor species appear below 400°C. Apparatus for
using this method to introduce tellurium into molten-
salt systems is under construction.

7. Behavior of Hydrogen and Its Isotopes

Hydrogen and helium solubilities in Li, BeF4 have
been determined at 600°C over the pressure range 1 to
2 atm. As expected, in both cases the solubility varied
linearly with saturation pressure over the range of
pressure investigated.

Chemical events associated with birth of tritons
through neutron capture in lithium and with thermali-
zation of the energetic triton have been considered.
Path length for thermalization is such that in an MSBR
core only a few percent of the tritons should reach
graphite before thermalization. Production of atomic
fluorine during thermalization of the triton adds an
insignificant fraction to the (low) concentration of F°
due to thermalization of the fission fragments. Overall,
it appears that previously assumed equilibria involving
U¥, U*, TF, and tritium should be applicable.

Deuterium permeation through Hastelloy N has been
measured over the pressure range from 30 torr down to
less than 1072 torr. Although earlier workers have
uniformly reported variance from a dependence as the
14, power of pressure at pressures below 10 to 100 torr,
no such departure was found in the present work.
Accordingly, the extrapolations which have been used
within MSRP for calculation of tritium permeation
appear correct, -

Initial experiments on type 304L stainless steel
showed that an oxide film decreased the permeation
flow and that such a film resulted in deviation from
dependence on ';, power of the pressure. Presently
available (and very simple) models of film behavior are
inadequate to explain the observations.
 

 

Measurements of hydrogen diffusing out of closed
capsules. containing fludroborate from a -convection
loop confirmed analyses of substantial (26 to 40 ppm)
concentrations of hydrogen within the salt. The mea-
surements also provided an estimate of the equilibrium
quotient of the reaction

OH" + ,Cr(s) = wert + 0% + BH, (2)
in molten fluoroborate at 535°C.

Infrared absorption ‘techniques are valuable in quanti-
tative study of BF;0H™ and BF;0D" ions in molten
fluoroborates. These studies have now been greatly
facilitated by design and fabrication of an LaF;-
windowed cell and furnace assembly. Operation of the
system with NaF-NaBF, mixtures to 450°C appears
quite satisfactory.

Continued study, by infrared absorption, of NaF-
NaBF, mixtures indicates, as before, the band at 3645
cm™ due to the stretching mode of OH in BF;0H"

and that at 2690 cm™ due to the OD stretch in

BF30D". These studies have, in addition, revealed that
simple bubbling with D, of a clean NaF-NaBF,; melt
containing. BF30H™ does not lead to appreciable
exchange of deuterium for hydrogen in the BF;OH™.
Reaction of the admitted D, to produce D* prior to
- the exchange appears necessary, though the species
responsible for the oxidation of D, to D* has not been
certainly identified.

Hitec, a commercial heat transfer medium consisting

of NaNO,, NaNO,, and KNO;, has been considered as

a coolant for an MSBR since it would certainly oxidize
and retain tritium. Thermal stability of this mixture to
600°C and of the individual components to 400°C has

been examined, using a mass spectrometer to identify

the gaseous species evolved.

8.F luoroborate Chemistry

Measurements of the solubility of BF; in LiF-BeF,
were continued, using an improved more-rapid .tech-
nique. The measurements continue to show that over
the composition range 50 to 85 mole % LiF, BF,
solubility varies almost linearly with the thermo-
dynamic activity of LiF. A study of the solubility of
BF; in MSBR fuel solvent indicated that BF; gas is
potentially useful in a reactivity control system.

- The formation free energies of NaNiF;: and NaFeF,
have been estimated from heterogeneous-equilibria mea-
surements. This permitted estimation of the most

oxidizing conditions which can exist in the presence of

molten mixtures of NaF and NaBF without significant
oxidation of nickel.

Approximately 1550 1b of NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole %)
was prepared for the Coolant Salt Technology Facility.

_ Analyses ‘of representative salt samples show’ that

sodium fluoroborate mixtures of sufficient purity can
be prepared from commercially available materials by
evaporation of water vapor during the melting process.

9. Protactinium Chemistry

Studies of various equilibria involving protactin-
ium(IV) and (V), MSBR fuel solutions, and solid oxides
have been completed. Protactinium(IV) and (V) con-
centrations have been measured as a function of
temperature at oxide saturation, and the potential of
the Pa*/Pa%* couple has been estimated. From these
results it is evident that protactinium could be precipi-
tated in a process side stream as Pa®* oxide while
avoiding oxide precipitation in the main fuel circuit,
where the Pa*" state is maintained by control of the
redox potential (U3*/U**).

Equilibrium measurements have been performed for
the distribution of Pa%* between molten MSBR solvent
salt and solid solutions of PaO,-ThO,. The equilibrium
quotients obtained, together with similar data for other
tetravalent actinide ions, yield a correlation with the

lattice parameters of the pure actinide dioxides.

The activity coefficients of ThO,, PaO,, and UO, in
the ternary oxide solid solutions which can be precipi-
tated by oxide from MSBR fuels have been estimated
from a previous correlation for binary oxide solid

solutions. At 600°C, p,q, is predicted to vary in the -

range 1.0 to 1.4, and the Pa/U ratio in the oxide solid
solution precipitated from an MSBR fuel will be ~, of
the corresponding ratio in the fuel.

10. Development and Evaluation
of Analytical Methods
for Molten-Salt Reactors

Automated in-line measurement of U(III) concentra-
tions in a thermal convection loop continued to show
excellent reproducibility and to demonstrate the ad-
ventitious oxidation of the U(III) by contaminants
introduced during the insertion of corrosion specimens
and. the recovery of the U(III) by oxidation of the
chromium from the structural metal and specimens. A
comparison of the experimental voltammetric waves for
U(III) with those computed from theoretical considera-
tions has shown that, while the reduction of chromium
 

 

makes a significant contribution to the early part of the
wave, an excellent match between theoretical and
experimental data is obtained in the region of the peak
reduction current. Moreover, the presence of chromium
does not introduce any significant error in the potential
at which the maximum in the derivative wave occurs.
The location of the derivative maximum is used to
compute the U(III) concentration. Under the reducing
conditions at - which the loop has been operated,
chromium is the only corrosion product that is present
in significant concentrations. Although the voltam-
metric determination of chromium is complicated by its
proximity to the larger uranium wave, we have found it

Xv

possible to extract a measurable chromium wave from

the reoxidation curves by a stripping technique. Calibra-
tions of this method are in progress.
We have investigated the electroanalytical chemistry

of titanium and bismuth in LiF-BeF,-ZrF,. The use of

Ti(IV) as a corrosion indicator for modified Hastelloy N
appears to be impractical because of the sublimation of
TiF,4 from the melts. Conversely, TiF; was found to be
stable in this solvent and exhibited a well-defined
oxidation wave, conforming to a reversible oxidation of
Ti(III) to Ti(IV), which should be useful for in-line
measurement of titanium in fuel. Voltammetric and
chronopotentiometric measurements of BiF; have
shown that it can be reversibly deposited in a single-step
three-electron reduction at a variety of electrodes.
Evidence of alloy formation was noted at platinum and
silver electrodes but not at graphite and iridium. Peak
currents vary linearly with concentration, and diffusion
coefficients of about 10° cm? [sec were measured.
Investigation of the voltammetric reduction of Cr(III)
in coolant melts showed that, while the reduction wave
occurs close to the cathodic limit of the NaF-NaBF,
melts, the resolution is adequate for peak current
measurements. The diffusion coefficient at 440°C was
found to be about 2 X Joe ¢m? [sec. Additional work
is needed to validate the method for in-line analysis.
Continued studies of the reduction of protons from
coolant melts at an evacuated palladium electrode have
indicated that the previously observed instability of the
protonated species in the melt is associated with the
glass envelope used to contain the system. Presently, we
are attempting to resolve problems associated with
lower-than-predicted voltammetric currents and with

poor reproducibility of the quantity of hydrogen which

diffuses into the evacuated electrode during electrolysis.
We are continuing to search for a method to validate
the infrared pellet technique for the determination of
BF; 0H" in NaBF,. While an isotopic-exchange method
tends to confirm the infrared results, it is subject to

"+ excessive. blanks and occasionally gives exorbitantly

high results. We are attempting to prepare samples of
negligible proton concentration and to find other
methods of standard proton addition.

We are currently using spectrophotometric techniques
to investigate, with members of other divisions, a
variety of problems associated with reactor fuel chemis-
try and reprocessing systems. These include the evalua--
tion of the potential of the Pa(IV)-Pa(V) couple, the
solubility of CuQ in fluoride melts, the measurement of
U(V) in fluoride melts, and the measurement of the
spectra of LiCl melts in contact with lithium alloys.
New techniques developed during this work include an
improved method for. the introduction of protected
samples to the spectrophotometric furnace and a
technique for sparging a sample contained in a window-
less cell.

11. Other Molten-Salt Researches

The solubility of Nb,Qs in molten LiF-BeF, mix-
tures saturated with BeO is observed to be too high to
be explained by the formation of the relatively unstable
and volatile NbF. It appears that the species formed in
solution is NbOFs2~ or NbOF¢>". In the presence of
nickel the solubility of niobium decreases by a factor of
10 or more because of the formation of nickel niobates
(NiNb, O¢ and NigNb, Oy). .

The products of the reaction of MoF with metallic
niobium were monitored over the temperature range 25
to 750°C. The molybdenum fluoride vapor products
appeared at nearly the same temperatures at which they
were observed when MoF, was reduced with molyb-
denum. No mixed niobium-molybdenum fluoride
species appeared, but the effusing vapors did react with

_ tantalum to yield the previously known compound

MoTaF,, and a previously undiscovered similar com-
pound NbTaF,,. Oxide impurities appeared predomi-
nantly as MoOF, below 450°C and predominantly as
Nb, OF, from 500 to 750°C. :

Nonideality of molten alkali fluoride—beryllium fluo-
ride mixtures is discussed in terms of (1) the application
of conformal ionic solution theory to the interaction
parameters and (2) the formation of fluoroberyllate
ions and their noninteraction with fluoride ions.

Chronopotentiometric measurements have been initi-
ated to investigate the formation of resistive BeF, films
on anodization of beryllium electrodes in molten alkali
fluoride—beryllium fluoride melts.

Electrical conductance of beryllium fluoride—-sodium
fluoride mixtures has been obtained for compositions

between 70 and 95 mole % beryllium fluoride and

temperatures between 485 and 600°C.

 

 
 

 

, ‘Equilibration of pure UC, U,C3, and UC, with UF,

xvi

and UF; dissolved in 2 LiF<BeF, with analysis by

spectrophotometric observations has shown that UC, is
the most stable of the carbides at 550°C. From these
data and plausible assumptions regarding activity of the
carbide phases, values for free energy of formation of
the carbides can be calculated.

_ Single crystals of the congruently melting compound
Na, LiBeF, have been shown by x-ray diffraction to
contain the Be,F,3 ion, consisting of two BeF,%"

_ ‘tetrahedra sharing a corner. Comparison of Raman

spectra of crystalline Na, LiBeF, with those for this
compound in the tholten state permits explicit identifi-
cation of BeF42™ and Be,F, ions in the melt. These
data, along with those for molten mixtures of LiF and
BeF,, where the situation is more complex, afford for
the first time, direct evidence for at least the simplest of
the Be-F polymers postulated by C. F. Baes in his
models of LiF-BeF, mixtures. .

A comprehensive study of the Raman spectra of
K,Cr,0, as crystalline solid, in saturated aqueous
solution at 25°C, and in the molten state is under way.
Since the Cr,0,2 ion is isomorphic with Be, F,2", it is
hoped that this study will aid in interpretation of the
spectrum of the latter ion.

~The phase diagrams of the systems M; BeF4-MI (M =
Li, Na, Cs) have been measured for a better understand-
ing of the effects of ion size, charge, and polarizability.

All systems exhibit positive deviation from ideality to a

varying degree. Only in dilute solutions of M, BeF, in
MI is there a high degree of dissociation of the BeF, 2%"
ion.

PART 3. MATERIALS DEVELOPMENT

12. Intergranular Cracking of
Structural Materials Exposed to Fuel Salt

Several components from the MSRE fuel system have
been examined in more detail. These studies have
shown that (1) the cracking was less in a freeze valve
where the fission product concentrations were lower

" than in the circulating loop, (2) samples from the

control rod thimble and spacer showed little or no

shallow that it is unlikely that corrosion accounts for
the cracking observed in the MSRE. Tube burst samples
of Hastelloy N tested in helium and salt environments

"showed no effect of environment on the rupture life,

but samples plated with 0.01 mg/cm? of tellurium

‘failed short of the expected rupture life. Cracks 5 to 10

mils deep were present in the specimens plated with
tellurium. Similar cracking has been caused in creep

.- specimens that were stlessed and exposed to tellurium

vapor simultaneously. Samples exposed to tellurium
vapor or electroplated with tellurium cracked when
strained after being annealed at 650°C. Ni-200 and type
304L stainless steel were more resistant to cracking by

tellurium. Several ‘alloys containing small additions of

sulfur and several fission products were tested; those
containing tellurium or sulfur had poor mechanical
properties at high temperatures.

13. Graphite Studies

Fabrication studies at ORNL are continuing, but

largely directed at applications other than nuclear.

effect of salt velocity on crack severity, (3) a sampler

cage rod deformed to fracture had deep cracks in the
part exposed to liquid and fewer cracks where the part
was exposed to gas, and (4) samples from the outer part
of the mist shield had deep cracks whether they were
exposed to flowing salt or to salt mist.
Intergranular corrosion has been shown to occur in

"very oxidizing fuel salt. However, the cracks are so

Because much of the work is concerned with relating
physical properties to microstructure, and such rela-
tions are obviously of direct concern to the radiation
damage problem, the findings are reported here. Rela-
tionships between strength and elasticity of graphites
have been observed for the ORNL materials. Those
graphites which are monolithic in structure have about
50% higher strengths for a given modulus than the more
conventionally fabricated materials. A similar linear
relationship between modulus and density has been
found, implying that pore morphology is the key free
variable dominating the mechanical properties.

Measurements of thermal conductivities on lightly
irradiated graphites (2 to 4 X 102! neutrons/cm?) have
indicated much sharper reductions in conductivity than
were expected at operating temperatures.

The general deterioration of permeability. with
damage noted in both gaseous impregnated and coated
samples was revealed by use of a scanning electron
microscope to be due to defective surface structures.
Cracking at sharp comers, soot inclusions in the
pyrolytic carbons, nonuniform coatings, and numerous
surface cracks have been observed. These defects were
not obvious in the optical microscope, but now that we
know what to look for, they can certainly be identified
at relatively low magnification.

Improved coatings have been produced, using propene
as the source of pyrocarbon, in a new coating furnace
using a mandrel support for the samples. The coatings
are extremely uniform in both thickness and texture,
 

 

xvii

and no microcracking has been found even at the high
magnifications of the scanning microscope. Permeabili-
ties in the 107° to 107'® cm?/sec range have been
easily obtained.

14. Hastelloy N

Samples of small commercial alloys containing from
0.5 to 2.0% Ti have been irradiated and creep tested.
The alloy with 2.1% Ti has acceptable properties after
irradiation at 760°C. Three small commercial alloys
with nominal additions of 2% Nb and 0.5% Ti have
exceptionally good strengths at 650°C. The improved
strength seems due to the formation of a very fine
strain-induced precipitate. Two new small commercial
heats with nominal additions of 2% Ti were received
and found to have excellent weldability. Phase analysis
work has shown that alloys modified with 1% Ti
contain some Ni;Ti and that alloys with 2.9% Ti
contain much larger amounts. The quantity of Ni; Ti in
alloys with 2.4% Ti does not seem embrittling.

Several thermal-convection loops with salts containing
LiF, BeF,, ThF,, UF,, and ZrF, have continued to
operate and have very low corrosion rates. Several
thermal-convection loops and two pumped systems
containing sodium fluoroborate continue to operate.
These systems show that corrosion in sodium fluoro-
borate is strongly dependent on impurities, tempera-
ture, and flow rate.

The corrosion rate of Hastelloy N in steam continues
to be <0.25 mil/year. However, the results from
stressed specimens are inconclusive. The duplex nickel
280 and Incoloy 800 tubing has good properties. The
sole flaw noted to date is that the nickel 280 forms
intergranular cracks at low strains, but the ductility can
be improved by reducing the oxide content of the
nickel.

15. Support for Chemical Processing

Work continued toward the construction of a molyb-
denum reductive-extraction test stand. A full-size mock-
up was used to establish the step-by-step fabrication
sequence. Construction began on a head-pot sub-
assembly prototype that involves all of the operations
required to fabricate the actual component. All of the

3%:-in.-OD closed-end back extrusions required for the’

head pots and disengaging sections were fabricated and
machined. Tubing for the various connecting lines was
obtained, inspected, and certified for use.’

A decision was made to use electron-beam welding to
join the back extrusions to form the head pots and

disengaging vessels. A technique was developed in which
the half sections are held together during welding by
molybdenum pins through a step joint, and several
successful ‘welds were made. Additional progress was
made on (1) tube-tube welding of %- and 1%-in.-OD
tubing using an orbiting-arc weld head and (2) vent-tube
welding which requires exceptional alignment to pre-
vent damage of the vent tube during electron-beam
welding.

Brazing experiments were continued to develop para-
meters for back-brazing and sleeve-brazing operations. -
Portable heating equipment was developed that will
enable us to field braze either inside the dry box or
outside the dry box with local atmosphere protection
of the heated area. .

Compatibility experiments of Mo, Ta, T-111, and
graphite in bismuth and bismuth-ithium solutions at

‘600 to 700°C were continued. A T-111 alloy loop

containing T-111 samples in Bi—2.5 wt % Li was
operated for 3000 hr, and postoperation examinations
were started. A molybdenum loop containing molyb-
denum samples in Bi—2.5 wt % Li and scheduled for
3000-hr operation was started. A Hastelloy N loop that
had been internally coated with chemically vapor-

"deposited - tungsten operated for only 24 hr at a

maximum temperature of 700°C before bismuth com-
pletely penetrated the wall of the Hastelloy N tubing.
Capsule tests on ATJ, AXF, and Graph-i-tite “A” for

500 hr at 700°C indicated that high-purity bismuth did

not intrude into any of the materials. Identical capsules
exposed to Bi—3 wt % Li suffered varying degrees of
metal intrusion, with the most porous ATJ being
completely penetrated in 500 hr. In a slightly different
test, however, an ATJ graphite crucible exposed to
Bi—2.2 wt % Li at 650°C for 720 hr did not indicate
any significant metal intrusion.

Molybdenum braze specimens showed small weight
gains when first exposed to H,-HF mixtures but larger
weight losses when subsequently exposed to a molten
salt at 650°C. Most of the weight loss was attributed to
dissolution of iron from the braze alloy.

- PART 4. MOLTEN-SALT PROCESSING
AND PREPARATION

16. Flowsheet Analysis

A design study and a cost estimate were completed
for a fluorination—reductive-extraction—metal transfer
processing plant that’ continuously processes the fuel
salt from a. 1000-MW(e) MSBR. The design study -
pointed out the need for additional development work

 
 

 

xviii

in three important areas: (1) finding materials of

construction suitable for containing molten bismuth
and bismuth-salt mixtures, (2) determining the chemical
behavior of noble metals in an MSBR, and (3) prevent-
ing entrainment of bismuth in salt leaving bismuth-salt
contactors.

A computer code that can be used. for calculating
steady-state concentrations and heat generation rates in
an MSBR processing plant is being developed. The
behavior of a total of 687 nuclides in 56 regions that
represent the processing plant is presently treated by

this code. An algorithm that has been developed for

solving the set of 38,000 algebraic equations that
represents the system results in solution of the equa-
tions by an iterative technique with the use of an
acceptably small amount of computer time. The code

has been used for calculating heat generation rates and

concentrations of fission products in a processing plant
whose operation is based on the fluorination—
reductive-extraction—metal transfer flowsheet. In the

- future, the ‘code will be used for carrying out para-

metric studies of this flowsheet and for making com-
parative studies of flowsheets based on other processing
methods such as oxide precipitation.

17. Processing Chemistry

Measurements were made of the equilibrium distribu-
tion of lithium and bismuth between liquid lithium-
bismuth alloys and molten LiCl over the temperature
range 650 to 800°C. Integral heats of formation of
liquid lithivm-bismuth alloys were calculated from data
available in the literature.

Additional data were obtained to define more ac-
curately the conditions required for the precipitation of
protactinium from LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12 mole %)
solutions containing UF, by sparging the salt with

H, O-HF-Ar gas mixtures. Equilibrium quotients for the.

reaction PaF;(d) + %H,0(g) = %Pa,05(s) + SHF(g)
were found to be 39 % 0.5 and 21 + 4 at 600 and
650°C respectively.

In studies related to the chemistry of fuel reconstitu-
tion, investigation of the reaction UF4(g) + UF4(d) = 2
UF;5(d) was continued. Gold apparatus was found to be
stable both to gaseous UF and to UF; dissolved in

. LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12 mole %) at 600°C. Under

certain conditions, UF; 'disproportionated, with the
rate of disproportionation being second order with
respect to UFs concentration.

18. Engineering Development of Processing Operations

‘Studies related to the development of a number of
processing operations were continued during this report
period. Additional information concerning the behavior
of lithium during metal transfer experiment MTE-2 was
obtained. The results are consistent with a recently
developed correlation of data for the distribution of
lithium and bismuth between: LiCl and lithfum-bismuth’
solutions. Operation of experiment MTE-2B was con-
tinued in order to further study the transfer of lithium
from lithium-bismuth solutions containing lithium at
concentrations of 3.7 to 16 at. %. The data obtained
thus far are consistent with the expected behavior of
lithium in a metal transfer process system. Installation
of equipment for the third engineering experiment for
development of the metal transfer process (MTE-3) has
been completed. To date, the equipment has been leak
tested and treated with hydrogen for the removal of
oxides. Bismuth for the contactor has been treated
with hydrogen and filtered before being trans
ferred to the contactor. The fluoride salt was con-
tacted with bismuth containing thorium before being
filtered and transferred to the fluoride salt surge
tank. Preparations are under way for charging the LiCl
and the 5 at. % Li-Bi solution to the system; when
charging of the phases is complete, we will be ready to
make the first run. We are designing a facility in which
we will carry out the fourth metal transfer experiment
(MTE-4). The experiment will use salt flow rates that

‘are 5 to 10% of those whict will be required for

processing a 1000-MW(e) MSBR. The experiment will
generate information on the rate of transfer of rare
earths in equipment of a design suitable for a processing
plant and will allow evaluation of potential materials of
construction. In particular, we plan to evaluate graphite
as a material for the salt-metal contactor. Valuable
information will also be collected during the use of
graphite and metal components in the same facility.

Overall mass transfer coefficients were obtained with
a water-mercury system in a stirred-interface contactor
of the type being used for development of the metal
transfer process. These experimentally determined co-
efficients are quite close to those- predicted by ex-
trapolation of the Lewis correlation, which is based on
experimental values obtained from solvent-water sys-
tems at much lower Reynolds numbers than are
encountered with salt and bismuth.

- Experiments were continued in which the rates of

transfer of ®7Zr and 237U from molten salt to bismuth
were measured during the countercurrent contact of

salt’ and - bismuth in a packed column. Design and
" development :work were initiated for the Reductive
Extraction Process Facility: (REPF), which will allow
testing and development of equipment of a design
suitable for use in a full-scale protactinium removal
process based on fluorination—reductive extraction. A
preliminary examination and a conceptual design for
the system have been partially completed. The facility
will allow operation of all steps of the reductive
extraction process for isolation of protactinium with
salt flow rates as high as about 25% of those required
for processing a 1000-MW(e) MSBR.

In preliminary tests of equipment for studying in-
duction heating in molten salt as a potential heat source
for nonradioactive tests of a frozen-wall fluorinator,
arcing between the coil and the vessel partially melted
the induction ‘coil. Although the arcing was attributed
to the use of argon as the inert cover gas, it prompted
reexamination of autoresistance heating for the internal
heat source. In autoresistance heating tests with a
fluorinator mockup, the desired mode of operation was
not achieved because the frozen salt layers formed with
low heat fluxes were not solid and hence were not
electrically insulating. Higher heat fluxes are needed in
order to obtain a lower wall temperature, and a large
temperature gradient is required to suppress dendrite
formation in order to produce a solid, electrically
insulating frozen layer.

Operation of a‘ small-scale engineering facility has
been continued in order to investigate the precipitation
of UO,-ThO, solid solutions from molten fluoride salt
by contacting the salt with argon-water gas mixtures.
The salt temperature, which was varied from 540 to
630°C, was observed to have little effect on the rate of
precipitation. However, the precipitation rate has been
found to be directly proportional to the rate at which
water is'supplied to the system, while the composition
of the gas mixture has little effect on water utilization.
The precipitates have been observed to settle rapidly,
and the salt and precipitates have been separated by
decantation accompanied by only a small amount of
entrainment. Samples of the salt and oxide precipitate
have shown that the two phases are not in equilibrium.
A model for the precipitation process in which the
solids, once formed, do not equilibrate with the salt has
been found to agree quite well with experimental data.
Oxide precipitation continues to appear to be an
attractive alternative to fluorination for removing ura-
nium from fuel salt that is free of protactinium.

Design of the components for the processing materials
test stand and the molybdenum reductive extraction

equipment was continued, and fabrication of some of
the structural parts of the test stand was started.
Specific accomplishments include: design of the ex-
pansion loops in thé molybdenum tubing; completion
of the preliminary piping drawings and the construction
of a full-scale mockup of the loop; design of the
molybdenum equipment support system; design of a
field assembly jig and a handling system so that the
loop can be field assembled in a horizontal position and
transported to the point of operation, where it will be
erected to the vertical position; and design of the
containment vessel, the seal-welded flange, the freeze
valves, and the transition joint nozzles.

An eddy-current type of detector is being developed
to allow detection and control of the bismuth-salt
interface in salt-metal extraction columns or mechani-
cally agitated salt-bismuth contactors. The probe con-
sists of a ceramic form on which bifilar primary and
secondary coils are wound. The ceramic form is placed
inside a molybdenum tube in order to protect the coils
from attack by salt or bismuth. A high-frequency
alternating current, which is passed through the primary
coil, induces a secondary coil current having an ampli-
tude and a phase shift that are dependent on the
conductivities of the materials adjacent to the coils. In
tests of the probe at 550 to 700°C by the phase shift
technique, the measurements were found to correlate

_ quite satisfactorily with the bismuth level around the

probe. The temperature dependence of the indicated

level varies from 0.003 in./°C at the upper end of the

probe to 0.009 in./°C at the lower end. It appears that
the probe is a sensitive and practical indicator for.
determining the bismuth level or for locating the

- salt-bismuth interface.

19. Continuous Salt Purification System

Four flooding runs and 17 iron fluoride reduction

runs were made with the new column, which is packed

with Yin. Raschig rings having a thinner wall and 32%
greater free volume than the %-in. Raschig ring packing
used previously. The maximum flow rates that can be
obtained with the new column are three times those
which could be obtained with the earlier packing,

"although the mass transfer coefficients are only 25% of

those observed previously. The use of S°Fe tracer
during the studies decreased the error in the reported
values for the iron concentration significantly over
values obtained with colorimetric analyses. A batch
 

experiment in which the FeF, concentration in salt was
decreased by dilution and by hydrogen sparging also
demonstrated the advantage of using ®°Fe tracer
counting rather than colorimetric analysis - as the
method for determining iron concentration. The packed

XX

column was also used to obtain salt holdup data. Salt
holdup in the column was found to increase linearly
from about 5% of the free column volume at a salt flow
rate of 100 cm®/min to 11% of the free volume at a
flow rate of 500 cm? /min.

The design and development program has the purpose
of describing the characteristics and estimating the
performance of future molten-salt reactors, defining the
major problems that must be solved in order to build
them, and designing and developing solutions to prob-
lems of the reactor plant. To this end we have published

a conceptual design for a 1000-MW(e) plant and have

contracted with an industrial group organized by
Ebasco Services Incorporated to do a conceptual design
of a 1000-MW(é). MSBR plant. This design study uses
the ORNL design for background and is to incorporate
the experience and the viewpoint of industry.

One could not, however, propose to build a

1000-MW(e) plant in the near future, so we have done

some studies of plants that could be built as the next
step in the development of large MSBR’s. One such
plant is the Molten-Salt Breeder Experiment (MSBE).
The MSBE is intended to provide a test of the major
features, the most severe operating conditions, and the
fuel reprocessing of an advanced MSBR in a small
reactor with a power of about 150 MW(t). An alterna-
tive is the Molten-Salt Demonstration Reactor (MSDR),
which would be a.150- to 300-MW(e) plant based
largely on the technology demonstrated in the Molten-
Salt Reactor Experiment, would incorporate a mini-
mum of fuel reprocessing, and would have the purpose
of demonstrating the practicality of a .molten-salt
reactor for use by a utility to produce electricity. The
present AEC program does not include construction of
an MSBE or MSDR, so these design studies have
recently been discontinued to free the effort for use on
problems of more immediate concern.

In addition to these general studies of plant designs,
the design activity includes studies of the use of various

fuel cycles in molten-salt reactors and assessment of the
safety of molten-salt reactor plants. The fuel cycle
studies have indicated that plutonium from light-water
reactors has an economic advantage over highly en-
riched 235U for fueling molten-salt reactors. Some
studies related to safety are in progress preliminary to a
comprehensive review of safety based on the ORNL
reference design of a 1000-MW(e) MSBR.

The design studies serve to define the needs for new
or improved equipment, systems, and data for use in
the design of future molten-salt reactors. The purpose
of the reactor development program is to satisfy some
of those needs. Presently the effort is concerned largely
with providing solutions to the major. problems of the
secondary system and of removing xenon and handling
the radioactive off-gases from the primary system. The
design is nearing completion for the gas system tech-
nology facility’ for use in testing the features and
models of equipment for the gaseous fission product
removal and off-gas systems and for making special
studies of the chemistry of the fuel salt. Construction is
well along on the coolant system technology facility for
use in studies of equipment, processes, and chemistry of
sodium fluoroborate ‘for the secondary system of a
molten-salt reactor.

The steam generator is a major item of equipment for
which the basic design data are few and the potential
problems are many. A program involving industrial
participation has been ‘undertaken ta provide the
technology for designing and building reliable steam
generators: for molten-salt reactors. As the first step in
this program a contract was negotiated with Foster
Wheeler Corporation for a conceptual design of a steam
generator for use with molten salt.

1.1.1 General

The design study of the 300-MW(e) demonstration
plant (MSDR) using a single-fluid molten-salt reactor
was completed during this period. A report on this

‘concept was drafted and will be issued as an ORNL-CF

memorandum. This summary report ¢oncludes work on

the demonstration reactor plant. In completing the

study, most of the effort went into examining details of
the design of the reactor core. Analyses were made of
graphite temperatures, hydraulic pressure drops, and
flow distribution.

Results of the hydraulic analyses caused us to make
some changes in the manner of distributing the flow
through the core and reflector. In principle, the core is
the same as has been described previously, but changes
have been made which make the flow less ambiguous.

A significant effort was put into the design of the

reflector which completely surrounds the core. Previ-
ously the methods of assembling the reflector and. of
accommodating the differential expansion between
graphite and vessel had not been defined. This has now
been done so that the assembly of the reflector and
core is described and structural. problems have been
solved. Also, hot-spot graphite temperatures for the
core and reflector have been calculated.

"A further addition to the concept involved incorpo-
rating a cooling heat exchanger into each of the three
cell atmosphere circulating systems. These coolers can,
by butterfly valves, be switched into the circuits in
place of the cell heaters. In this way the cell atmosphere
can be cooled for removing afterheat from equipment
after shutdown. Use of these coolers guarantees that
nothing in the cell will overheat, even after an emer-
gency or accidental drain of the primary salt.

Two other rather minor additions were made to the
plant design. The one large tank of water to which the
drain tank heat is dumped by the natural-convection
NaK circuits was divided into three tanks, any two of
which would provide sufficient cooling. Also, instead of

boiling water from these tanks, water flows through
them to remove the heat. Boiling is employed only if’
water circulation is interrupted.

The temperature of one type of boron control rod
was calculated to determine if such a rod would

overheat. This calculation gave 1260°F for the hot-spot
metal temperature of the rod, and this is an acceptable
temperature.

1.1.2 Reactor Core

The design of the core region has not changed from
that reported previously’! except in the top orificing,
which will be explained later. Figures 1.1 and 1.2 are a
plan and an elevation of the reactor which show the

graphite internal structure. This core and reflector have

axial salt flow only, and the flow is from bottom to
top, with no downward flow as was previously used in
the top reflector.

In the bottom and top reflectors, graphite is fixed by
bolting to two identical mounting heads which form
top and bottom plena to distribute and collect the salt.
The bottom and top reflector pieces are laminated out
of slabs of graphite about 2 in. thick by 12 in. wide,
cemented together. These laminated blocks are then
machined into sectors which are bolted to flat “lands”
on the dished heads. The reflector sectors form 12
concentric rings on each head, with salt flow passages
between the rings. Such a mounting maintains uniform

passages between the graphite sectors and rings as the
"vessel heats up.

In order to correctly orifice the flow through the

reflector, the mounting heads have 1l-in.-diam holes
under the circular slots between concentric rings. The

number of holes increases as the radius increases. The
velocity of salt flow is held essentially constant and is
about 5 fps. The mounting heads are welded into the
reactor vessel after the reflector graphite has -been
attached.

The radial reflector is made up of laminated blocks of

two different shapes, plus some odd-shaped filler blocks
used to wedge the reflector to the vessel wall. The outer
reflector is made up of laminated wedges about 10 ft

long by 3 ft high. These wedges are machined to fit the

1. MSR Program Semiannu. Progr. Rep. Aug. 31, 1971,
ORNL-4728, p. 3 ff.
 

 

vessel wall at the eight places where they are installed
around the inside perimeter. Any out-of-roundness of

the vessel is accommodated by fitting each wedge to’

within approximately !%¢ in. of the wall. When all

pieces have been put into place, retaining “T irons are

fixed to the vertical metal ribs, and wedging pieces of
graphite are inserted behind the “T”’ irons. Thus the
outer reflector is made to move out with the vessel wall
as it expands.

The inner layer of reflector is made up of columns of
graphite approximately 1 ft wide by 2 ft thick by 21 ft
long. These columns are laminated from slabs similar to
those used in the core. The columns are doweled into
the bottom axial reflector, but the dowels are loose
enough to permit the columns to float up from the
bottom reflector while still being tied to it radially. The
columns are installed with '-in. gaps from the outer

reflector pieces and between columns. Also, the bottom

edge of each column has a 2 X ¥, in. slot machined on
it to provide access for flow to the vertical slot should
any columns fail to float when the reactor is full of
salt.
At the top of the radial reflector, horizontal bars of

graphite approximately 1 in. thick by 3 in. wide by 2%
ft long fit in milled slots in the columns and in the
outer reflector. Each bar is doweled to one column and
to a wedge of outer reflector graphite in a manner such
as to orifice a flow channel between columns and to
maintain the desired location of the column. The
horizontal bars rest against the top reflector when the

reactor is filled with salt and provide a Yj-in.-thick salt
plenum over the radial reflector graphite.

The core is an octagonal array of graphite slabs
approximately 1% by. 9% in. in cross section. These
slabs are assembled into cells approximately 11% in.
square. The slabs are separated by dowels which provide
vertical flow passages approximately 0.142 in. wide
from bottom to top of the core. The plan arrangement
of a core cell is shown in Fig. 1.3. Posts define the
corners of the cells. Each post has a dowel 1% in. in
diameter by 6 in. long on the bottom end that fits into
a hole in the corner of a graphite “eggcrate” grid which

rests on the bottom axial reflector. This grid positions
the core cells and prevents accumulation of radial
expansion spaces in any region of the core.
Around the top of the core is a graphite collar which
prevents spreading of the vertical core cells into the

annulus between the core and the reflector. This

annulus, approximately 0.75 in. wide, results from the
differential expansion between the metal vessel and the
graphite. The collar also blocks the annulus at the top

to prevent excessive flow in this path of low pressure

drop. Flow from the annulus has to cross through the
radial slots in the inner reflector and exit through the
slots in the outer reflector pieces. Figure 1.4 is a detail
of the collar structure.

The graphite core is assembled in the vessel and then
orifice plates are put on top of the core cells to make
the core flow distribution match. the radial power
distribution. These flat plates are approximately 11%
in. square by 1% in. thick, with edges undercut to fit
down into the cells. The plates are fitted as closely as
tolerances permit. Resting on top of the cell side plates,
an orifice plate leaves a %;-in. gap between its underside
and the top of the five slabs that make up the internal
structure of a cell. Short dowels on the underside of the
orifice plate prevent the slabs from floating up and

closing this gap. In the center of each plate is an orifice.
The diameter of this hole is 2.05 in. for the center cells,
is 0.74 in. for peripheral cells, and varies between these
extremes as a function of the radial power distribution
for cells at intermediate positions. :
In addition to regulating the flow through the cells,
these cover plates tie the core together at the top and
prevent ‘expansion spaces- from accumulating in one
location. Four - %,-in.-diam dowels extended 1% in.
above the top of each orifice plate. After the plates
“have been placed on top of the core, rectangular tie
blocks 1% in. thick, 3 in. wide, and 6 in. long, with two
holes in each, are placed over the dowels of adjacent
plates. These rectangular links tie all the cells together,
but the ties are not rigid and will allow some movement

of the core if needed. The links cannot float free of the

dowels, even if some cells stick, and do not float to the
underside of the top axial reflector. Figure 1.5 shows
the arrangement of the orifice plate and links of a
typical core cell. )

produced in the salt and in the graphite. When the
temperature distributions in the salt and in the graphite
were calculated and then combined in the appropriate
manner, the hot-spot temperature of the core graphite
was found to be 1190°F.

The power generation in the reflector graphite is
much lower than in the core graphite, but the reflector
blocks are much thicker and there is less salt flow for
removing the heat. Because of these factors, the
hot-spot temperature in the reflector graphite was
calculated to be 1341°F. This temperature is tolerable,
because the neutron flux in the reflector is so low that
adequate graphite life is attained even at this tempera-
ture. )

1.1.4 Cell Cooling

Three systems that circulate cell atmosphere through
electric furnaces are used to heat the primary system
equipment cells in the MSDR design.? We have added
coolers, bypass ducts, and butterfly valves to these
systems so that the circulating gas can be cooled or

"heated. Each of the coolers consists of 225 thimbles 2

in. in outside diameter, 0.035 in. in wall thickness, and
4 ft long, in square array 15 X 15 with a pitch of 3 in.
Inside each thimble is a reentrant tube in which water
boils at atmospheric pressure. Heat is transferred from
the thimbles to the reentrant tubes by radiation only.

Heat is transferred from the reactor equipment to the
circulating nitrogen and from the nitrogen to the
cooling thimbles. When the cooling systems are put into
use after shutting down the reactor and draining the salt
immediately, the cooling is sufficient to keep the heat
from decay of deposited fission products from raising
the temperature of the reactor vessel; in fact, it begins
to drop immediately and after 8" hr is down to about
990°F. Therefore, if the circulation blowers are run-
ning, there is no overheating of the reactor cell
components or the cell wall, even after an emergency
drain.

1.2 SIDE-STREAM PROCESSING OF MSBR
PRIMARY FLOW FOR 10DINE REMOVAL

 R.P. Wichner

Laboratory experiments on the stripping of iodide

_ from LiF-BeF, melts have been described in previous

progress reports.3~5 Hydrogen was used as the carrier
gas in these experiments primarily to inhibit corrosion
of the apparatus, with HF oxidizer added to the extent
that it formed from 1 to 20 mole % of the stripping gas.

. The results were analyzed according to the reaction

HF(g) +1" =F + HI(g) . oo Q)

Briefly, it was found that the logarithm of the iodide

- concentration remaining on the melt varied linearly

with the moles of HF passed. Equilibrium between
phases was assumed, which allowed evaluation of the
equilibrium constant for reaction (1) directly from the
slope of the depletion curve. However, it was found
that the equilibrium constant determined in this fashion
evidently varied with the partial pressure of HF. This
indicated that some incorrect assumption was made in
the analysis, or some unaccounted for phenomenon
occurred in the experiment. Hence it was not possible
at that point to come to a knowledgeable evaluation of
the potential for stripping iodine from MSBR fuel, and

the question was temporarily dropped.

A new analysis of the stripping experiments, given in
a forthcoming report, has evidently resolved this
difficulty. It was shown that if one postulates that

“diffusion of I~ in the melt to the gas/liquid interface is

the rate limiting step in the desorption process, there
results a mathematical model which is in accord with
the experirmental data in the following respects: (1) a
linear decrease of In [I”} with time or moles of HF
passed is corroborated; (2) the apparent equilibrium
constant, based ‘on the assumption of equilibrium
between the phases, is shown to indeed vary with HF

© partial pressure exactly as was observed; (3) the trend

of the observed dependence of apparent equilibrium
constant with both melt composition and temperature
is qualitatively explained. In addition, it was shown that

"the rate of iodine stripping in the laboratory experi-

ments was consistent with calculated values based on
available bubble surface area and estimated mass trans-
fer coefficients.

It is therefore concluded that iodine stripping from
LiF-BeF, mixtures is now understood. Although
further experiments under conditions which come
closer to a realistic situation are thought to be highly
desirable, there is at this time some possibility for

ually remove iodine from the MSBR fuel. Such an
evaluation will be included in ref. 6.

1.3 MSBR INDUSTRIAL DESIGN STUDY
M. I. Lundin

The Ebasco MSBR reference concept was completed
during this period.

The reactor consists of a 2-in.-thick cylindrical vessel
{nominally 22 ft OD X 20 ft high) supported from the
bottom. Salt enters through four inlet nozzles at the
bottom at 1050°F and exits through four outlet nozzles
at the top. The vessel contains 415 tons of graphite
which defines salt flow channels in the following
regions: core, axial and radial blankets, inlet and outlet
salt plena, and axial and radial neutron reflectors. Each
region has a specific salt fraction chosen to produce the
desired nuclear characteristics of that region. Based on
an evaluation of the ORNL reference concept, it was
decided to retain the physics characteristic of that
concept for task 1. This was done by preserving the salt
composition, the region salt fractions, and region
dimensions specified in the ORNL reference concept
(case CC-120).

The Ebasco concept does, however, have two minor
variations in the graphite region dimensions:

1. The salt annulus between the radial blanket and
the reflector was eliminated. This annulus, whose
function was to provide clearance between permanent
and replaceable graphite for unit core replacement, is
no longer required. In the Ebasco concept, individual
graphite assemblies will be replaced on a four-year
schedule. Only those assemblies which cannot survive
another four-year exposure interval are replaced.

2. The inlet and outlet plena have been extended into
the axial blanket regions for improved flow distri-
bution.

Neither of these changes will make an appreciable
effect on the nuclear performance of the reactor.

The core and blanket moderator bundles consist of

ribbed graphite plates arranged into hexagonal assem-
blies 15.6 in. across flats.

Fuel salt flows from the reactor into four parallel
circuits, each with a salt-circulation pump in the hot leg

‘and an intermediate heat exchanger (IHX) where the

heat is transferred to the secondary salt.

The IHX is a vertical sine-wave-bent tube design with
a nonremovable tube bundle. Fuel salt enters the top
plenum, flows downward through about 7000 tubes (%
in. OD), and exits at the bottom. The coolant salt

enters at the bottom, flows up in a mixed counter-
current flow, and exits at the top.

The secondary system also has four parallel circuits,
each containing one IHX, steam generator, steam
reheater, and circulation pump. The pump is in the cold
leg to pressurize the IHX sufficiently to force any
leakage to be directed into the primary system. The
steam generator concept is a supercritical, once-
through, helical-coil tube design. Supercritical fluid
enters at the top, flows down through annular rows of
unheated downcomer tubes, turns, and flows up
through the heat transfer zone. The steam flows
through 815 tube coils, countercurrent to the coolant
salt. The steam reheater is identical to the steam
generator except for its size.

The steam system basically consists of a supercritical
steam cycle using a tandem-compound turbine gener-
ator with reheat and feedwater heaters. Except for the
steam generators, reheaters, supercritical feedwater
pumps, and preheater-reheater, the system utilizes
conventional power plant technology and designs. The
feedwater temperature is 700°F to prevent freezing of
coolant salt in the steam generator. This high feedwater
temperature causes the steam system to differ from a
completely conventional supercritical steam system.

The chemical process plant permits the reactor to
operate as a breeder by removing 233Pa and certain
soluble parasitic neutron absorbers from the fuel salt. It
also reconstitutes the salt and returns it to the primary
system. The plant flowsheet was developed and sup-
plied by ORNL.

This conceptual design reflects CONOCO’s experience
and judgment regarding need and location of pumps,
valves, surge volumes, drain systems, safety, control
system, and spatial layout.

The chemical processing cell is heated to prevent salt

‘freezing. It is of a modular design for replacement of

equipment by remote techniques. The upper level
contains process equipment; the lower level contains
drains and storage tanks. The cooling system uses NaK
and is independent of other cooling systems in the
reactor building.

The reactor off-gas system removes fission gases,

particularly '35Xe and tritium, from the fuel salt. A

purge gas (helium) throughput of (nominally) 10 scfm,
together with efficient bubble separation from a 10%
salt sidestream, will keep the salt void fraction in the
core to about 1% (about 0.6% volume-weighed loop
average). Based on these conditions, it is speculated that
a poison fraction of 0.5% (0.005 neutron absorbed in
135Xe per absorption in fissile isotopes) can be
achieved with unsealed graphite.

 
 

Reduction of the !35Xe concentration in the purge
gas is accomplished primarily by decay during holdup in

10

the drain tank, and the gas is recycled directly to the

“bubble injector. It is anticipated that some gas cleanup
via charcoal adsorption will be required. These charcoal
beds consist of coils of charcoal-filled piping submerged

in cylindrical water tanks. Xenon is removed from the
helium by dynamic sorption. The decay heat (about 2
MW) is removed by forced circulation of water through
coolers. The off-gas system will also remove krypton,
tritium, and volatile hydrocarbons from the purge gas.

The fuel tank—drain tank system is intended to
provide a safe place to store the salt at any time under
all conceivable circumstances. It also provides holdup
and cooling for the purge gas during normal operation.
This tank is located below the reactor cell to permit
drainage by gravity. The salt (or purge gas) is cooled by

about 1000 bayonet tubes inside thimbles mounted
into the tank head. The coolant is NaK, which
circulates by natural convection through many re-
dundant external cooling circuits. Fission gas decay
heat (about 18 MW) is transferred to the main steam
system when in operation. Otherwise, it is transferred
to a closed-cycle, boiling-water, heat rejection system.

The reactor cell, chemical plant, off-gas system, drain
tank cell, graphite handling equipment, and emergency
power generators are located in the reactor building, a
rectangular class 1 structure. Seismic supports are

. provided for the reactor and intermediate heat ex-

changers in a horizontal plane by a three-tier support
structure of Inconel beams. Structural support is
provided at the bottom of the reactor and heat
exchangers. The reactor building provides containment
against release of radioactivity. :

1.4 MSBE DESIGN
H. A. McLain =D. W. Wilson

Layout studies of the MSBE core reported previ-
ously” have continued, but using a coré constructed of
slab-type graphite elements rather than those of the
prismatic design. The advantage of the slab-type ele-
ment is that it is easier to fabricate; particularly there is
no central hole requiring pyrolytic graphite coating.

Consideration was given as to how a slab element
could best be fitted into the overall cylindrical core
layout. The individual slabs are incorporated into a
moderator element measuring 7.27 X 6.93 in., with
each moderator element, except those at the edge of
the core, containing five graphite slabs having cross-
section dimensions of about 7.27 X 1.25 in. (slab width
does not include the ribs). The slab ribs are arranged to
form 0.17-in.-thick salt flow channels giving the desired
15% salt fraction in the core. Lifting and suspension
support for each moderator element is supplied by its
center slab. This support is transferred to the other

slabs by use of two cross ribs attached to the center slab
* by graphite bolts. A floating head allows orificing of the
* channel flows and provides space for differential ex-
pansion between the center slab and the other slabs of

the element. An isometric view of ‘the moderator

element containing these features is shown in Fig. 1.6.
Some of the moderator elements used at the edge of the
core contain only three graphite slabs to approximate
the cylindrical core geometry, as shown in Fig. 1.7.

The basic moderator “elements are modified at five
points in the core to form circular salt channels about
2% in. in diameter. Four of these are required for the
control rods, and the fifth, which is at the center of the
reactor, is for the insertion of sample specimens. The
locations of these channels are shown in Fig. 1.7.

The four control rods would be fabricated of Hastel-
loy N in a cruciform shape, with each designed to drop’
into one of the 2%-in.-diam salt channels. A graphite
extension would be placed on the end of the control
rod to protect the core graphite from damage, and to
provide orificing of the salt flow through the control
channel. Scratching of the core graphite by the edges of
the cruciform is prevented by graphite buttons or strips
fastened to them. A typical layout of such a control rod
is shown in Fig. 1.8.

It was decided that the control-rod drive mechanisms
should be of the positive coupled design, and three
types were considered for preliminary study. They were
the magnetic jack, the roller nut, and the rack and
pinion. All three filled the preliminary requirements of
simplicity of operation, operational experience, and
speed of response. The three-coil magnetic jack finally
was selected for use as a future reference because of its
simplicity, reliability, standardization of design, and
extensive use in the present water power reactors.

1.5 BUBBLE BEHAVIOR IN THE MSBR
PRIMARY SALT SYSTEM

H. A. McLain L.W. Gilley?
T. C. Tucker®

A digital computer program, BUBBLE, has been
written describing in detail the behavior of the gas
bubbles circulating with the salt through the MSBR

13

 

primary salt system. This program is now being incor-
porated into a larger digital computer program describ-
ing the detailed behavior of the noble gas in the MSBR.
The intent of this effort is to either confirm the results
of the simplified calculations of Kedl® describing the
noble-gas behavior in the MSBR or to make improve-
ments where required.

In the BUBBLE program it is assumed that the
number of bubbles per unit salt volume and the sum of
the gas dissolved in the salt and present in the bubbles
per unit salt volume are constant throughout the salt
loop (with the exception of the small volume of salt
between the gas separator and tH bubble generator). It
is assumed also that the bubble size distribution at any
location within the salt loop is described by the
distribution function given by Kress:*®

: o 1/2
r@=4(L)" & exp (a),
in which
d = bubble diameter,

E at |
o =

6d

Ny = number of bubbles per unit salt volume,

’

® = void fraction.

The rate of transfer of the dissolved gas to the
bubbles can be described by the relation :

dC/dt = —ka(C — Hp),

where

C = concentration of gas dissolved in salt,
k = mass transfer coefficient,
a = surface area of bubbles per unit salt volume,
H = Henry's law constant,
p = pressure,
t = time.

For the bubble size distribution function given above,
the surface area of the bubbles per unit volume of salt is

dc

Assuming perfect gas behavior and neglecting the
surface tension effects, the volume fraction of the
bubbles is

®=(V-CRT/p,
where
N = total sum of gas per unit volume of sait,
R = gas constant,
T = temperature.
The above relations are combined to give

2/3
= 42168, 1/2 «(5T) (VN -C)*3 (C- Hp).

This relation is solved by numerical methods to give the
dissolved gas concentrations throughout the primary
salt loop. Once the dissolved gas concentrations are

known, all of the other parameters relating to the

16

bubbles can then be determined by using the appro-

priate relations.

In the parts of the primary salt loop defined as
straight channels, fuel channels, piping, etc., the term to
the left of the equal sign in’ the above relation can be
rewritten as

dc _ dc
dr dx ’
where

u = salt velocity,
x = distance.

The value of the mass transfer coefficient to the
bubbles, k, is assumed to be that predicted by the
relations reported by Kress'! correlating the results of
his bubble mass transfer experiments.

Similarly, in the portions of the primary salt loop
defined as plenum regions, pump volute, heat exchanger
plenums, etc., the term to the left of the equal sign in

the above material balance can be rewritten as

dc _ dc
x Va
where

V = volumetric salt flow rate,

v = volume.

In these regions the value of the mass transfer coeffi-
cient to the bubbles, k, is assumed to be that predicted
by the Calderbank and Moo-Young relation:!?

: / 2/3
k=0.13 [pres] 2) :
p c

where
” = power dissipated per unit fluid volume,
= Newton’s law conversion factor,
So Schmidt modulus,
u= = salt viscosity,
p = salt density.
No attempt has been made so far to account for any

mass transfer between the bubbles and the salt within

the gas separator and the bubble separator. The gas
separator is treated simply as a unit that removes a

specified fraction of the bubbles but does not affect the

bubble size distribution. An equal amount of bubbles is
then replaced in the salt by the bubble generator.
Therefore, in the piping between the gas separator and
the bubble generator, the total gas per unit salt volume
is reduced by the amount

EwW-0),

where & = gas separator efficiency. In this same piping
the area for mass transfer to the bubbles is reduced by
the factor £.

Some initial cases calculated by this program indicate
that the transport rate of a gas to the bubbles (product
of the mass transfer coefficient and the bubble surface
area) is not a significant function of the volume-to-
surface mean diameter for a given void fraction of
bubbles in the reactor. This is not too surprising, since
the bubble mass transfer coefficient correlation of
Kress'3 states that in flow regimes where the buoyancy
forces are insignificant compared with the turbulent
forces, the mass transfer coefficient is proportional to

the volume-to-surface mean diameter. Since the Kress
correlation for this flow regime applies to most parts of
the MSBR primary salt system and since by definition
the bubble surface area is inversely proportional to the
volume-to-surface mean diameter, the gas transport rate
is essentially constant for a given bubble void fraction.

With the number of bubbles per unit salt volume held
constant, increasing the void fraction increases the

17

mean diameter of the bubbles, the surface area, and the
mass transfer coefficient. This results in large increases
in the gas transport rate to the bubbles. Also, significant
variations in the transport rates occur throughout the
primary salt loop as a result of differences in tempera-
ture that affect the mass transfer coefficients and

differences in temperature and pressure that affect the

mean bubble diameter.

2.1 EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS

2.1.1 HTLTR Lattice Experiments
G.L.Ragan  O.L. Smith

The experimental program of the Battelle Northwest
Laboratories which measured the neutron physics
parameters of a simulated MSBR lattice at temperatures
to 1000°C has been reported.! We are ready to proceed

with corresponding calculations, whose validity will be,

tested by comparison with the experimental results.
During this report period we have updated our cross-
section library and made and tested code modifications,

some of which were described in our last progress

report.?

Basic cross-section library. In preparation for the
HTLTR analysis, we have compiled a new cross-section
library in our standard 123-energy-group format. This
did not represent any major revision in our cross-section
data, but is part of our continuing effort to keep MSR
production cross sections up-to-date.

With the notable exceptions of lithium, carbon, and
fluorine, the data for the new library were obtained
from the ENDF/B version II files. The cross sections for
SLi and 7Li were prepared from ENDF/B version III
data. For carbon, the thermal scattering data were
prepared by a code using the incoherent crystalline
scattering model. The capture cross section of carbon
was normalized to 4.0 mb at 2200 m/sec (in contrast to
the ENDF normalization of 3.4 mb) to account for
impurities in nominal MSR-grade graphite. The capture
cross section in our carbon has the correct 1fv
dependence in the epithermal and fast range, in contrast

to the ENDF representation, which is arbitrarily set to
zero at 4 keV. The cross sections for fluorine are not
available on the ENDF/B library, so for some years we
have used data of our own evaluation. In preparing our
new cross sections we revised the ! ° F(n,a) cross section
downward by about 50% to take into account recent
data.

Our updated 123-group library contains cross sections
for all important MSR nuclides at the following
temperatures: 293.6, 573, 900, and 1273°K. Carbon is
available also at 1000°K.

Resonance-groups treatment. Like many other reactor -
lattices, the MSBR lattice in the HTLTR was doubly
heterogeneous, being composed of moderator material
surrounding fuel rods that were in turn heterogeneous
dispersions of grainy materials. During this report
period we performed some calculations for resonance-
energy neutrons to test the method we had developed
for dealing with the double heterogeneity. As described
below, we found that for the simple laminar geometry
in the test problem the method is inaccurate and it is
better simply to homogenize the fine heterogeneity in

“the treatment of resonance-energy neutrons. (The treat-

ment of thermal neutrons is a different matter, dis-
cussed later.)

It is customary to define a self-shielding factor, at
each energy, by the equation

¢(grain)

_o(grain) _ ¢(rod) a
~ lattice cell) :

o_
c (rod) - lattice cell) ’

~The first, flux ratio is the fine heterogeneity factor; the

second, the gross heterogeneity factor. Existing treat-
ments assume separability of the two factors, that is,
that they can be approximated by evaluating the fine
heterogeneity factor for an infinite medium of grainy
rod material, then using cross sections disadvantaged by
this factor in a smeared-fine-structure representation of
the rod in evaluating the gross heterogeneity factor.
 

Several different prescriptions®S have been proposed
for the fine heterogeneity factor. The gross factor is
usually obtained by the Nordheim integral treatment
(NIT), using codes such as GAM-II® and GAROL.”

We have developed a method that is similar in
principle to the others in that we assume separability,
but we obtain both factors by NIT calculations. The
GAM-II part of the XSDRN® code was suitably revised
to perform a double NIT treatment, making two
successive passes (treating fine and coarse hetero-
geneity) through the fine energy mesh of each reso-
nance. Also, the GAM-II equations were modified to

yield, at each energy, a moderator-region flux that’

agrees with that obtainable by the GAROL code, which
solves explicitly for the neutron collision densities and
thus avoids some of the approximations in GAM-II

We have used a set of simple laminar problems to test
important features of our method by comparison of

results from double NIT with those from a reliable

reference calculation using the discrete ordinates code
ANISN.? (Laminar geometry permits use of ANISN and
also the exact calculations of escape probabilities and
Dancoff factors.) In the reference case (case 2 in Table
2.1), absorber grains were simulated by ThO, slabs
0.0040 cm thick (comparable to the 0.0059-cm mean
diameter of the particles in the HTLTR experiments).
These were alternated with carbon slabs 0.022 cm thick

to build up a laminated region 1.04 cm thick simulating .

an absorber rod. Finally, these laminated absorber
regions were alternated with 6.6-cm-thick graphite
moderator slabs to simulate the main lattice. Two other

Table 2.1. Comparison of results? from double NIT and from ANISN for the lowest major thorium resonance

 

19

cases were also considered: one with coarser structure
in the absorber region (case 1 in Table 2.1) and one in
which the absorber region was homogenized (case 3).
The atom densities and volume fractions in the refer-
ence case were preserved in the other two cases.

The specific results that were compared are (1) the
absorber-to-matrix flux ratio (I') in the laminated
absorber region at the peak energy (21.7 eV) of the
lowest major thorium resonance and (2) the thorium
absorption cross section (0,) averaged over the lattice
cell and the energy range (17.98 to 25.42 eV) covering
the resonance. Both the ANISN and the double-NIT
calculations used the 403 energy groups set up by

GAM-II for that energy range. The ANISN calculation
was done at S-32 quadrature (required to get I' to an
estimated accuracy of 10. 003) and scattering order P-1
(insensitive).

Four major conclusions can be drawn from the results
summarized in the first four lines of Table 2.1 — line 5
will be discussed below.

1. The separability assumption leads to large errors in

‘I. Compare the true I" values of line 2 with those of

line 1, obtained by considering the laminated absorber
region alone.

2. For conditions existing in the laminated absorber,
small errors in escape probability result in much larger
errors in I". The line 4 I values agree well with line 1,
but a significant error is contributed by the use of
approximate escape probabilities (line 3) even though
the approximation used was the excellent one, due to
Nordheim, that is used in GAM-II and GAROL. A
similar sensitivity to errors in the Dancoff factor was
noted.

3. The grain effect (depression of 0, relative to case
3) is overestimated severalfold by double NIT - taking
the ANISN result in line 2 to be correct.

4. Hence, the best procedure found in this study is to
homogenize the fine structure and treat the gross
heterogeneity by an NIT calculation — which is the
procedure; that gave the NIT results of the last column.

It must be emphasized that the above conclusions are
based on a laminar model. A comparable study, based

appears to be very difficult. The extent to which these
conclusions are’ valid for other geometries is an open
question, but an indication of the magnitude of the
effects in the HTLTR analysis, relative to those in the

"above study, is afforded by the following series of

calculations.

We set up three cases comparable to the slab cases of
Table 2.1, but with HTLTR-type geometry: spherical
absorber grains in cylindrical absorber rods arranged in
a square-lattice array. The absorber grain diameters

were chosen to have the same mean chord lengths as did |

the corresponding absorber slabs of Table 2.1; the

respective grain diameters were 0.0600 cm, 0.0120 cm,

and infinitesimal (homogenized fine structure). The
absorber rods had the same mean chord length as did
the 1.04-cm-thick laminated absorber slabs; hence, their
diameter was 2.08 cm. All atom densities and volume
fractions were kept the same as in the slab problems;

‘the resulting square-lattice rod spacing was 5.00 cm.

The ANISN code cannot treat this geometry, so
results comparable to lines 1-and 2 of Table 2.1 cannot
be given. Nor are results comparable to. line 4 given,

\

20

since exact escape probabilities are not available. The
results given in line 5 are calculated by the double-NIT
code, using the same Nordheim-type approximation for

- escape probabilities as was used for line 3. Thus lines 3

_ on a more realistic model, would be of interest, but it .

and 5 may be compared to evaluate geometrical
differences in resonance self-shielding effects.

Let us define the grain effect as the fractional
decrease in g, ‘relative to that for the corresponding
homogenized-fine-structure case. Then for case 1, the
grain effect for line 3 (grains represented as slabs) is
found to be 6.9%, while that for line S (spherical grains) -
is only 2.7%. For case 2, the grain effect is 2.2% for
slabs and 0.5% for spheres. The grain effects for slabs
are found to be severalfold too large, taking line 2
(ANISN) to be correct. Errors are due both to the
separability assumption and to the escape probability
approximation, and both errors have the same sign. The
same two errors are present in the grain effects
estimated from line 5, so that they, too, may be
assumed to be overestimates. Hence, the true grain
effect for 0.0120-cm-diam spheres (line 5, case 2) may
be taken as less than 0.5%. The mean ThO, grain
diameter in the HTLTR mixture was 0.0059 cm, about
half that of line 5 of case 2. Since the grain effect in
line § appears to vary linearly with grain diameter, we
estimate that the true grain effect for the HTLTR grains
is less than 0.25%. If the double-NIT treatment over-
estimates the grain effect by more than a factor of 2, as
it did in the slab study, neglecting ‘the adjustment is
better than making it. Hence we plan to neglect this
grain effect, simply homogenizing the fine structure and
doing a normal NIT calculation of the resonance-groups
cross sections., The resulting cross sections should be
high by less (perhaps much less) than the 0.25%
adjustment that a double-NIT treatment would give.
Since less than 26% of the neutron absorptions occur in
the resonance energy range, neglecting the grain effect
should underestimate the multiplication factor k by less
(perhaps much less) than 0.00065 (i.e., 0.26 X 0.0025).

Thermal-groups treatment. Although grain effects
were found to be negligible in the resonance energy
range, that is not the case at thermal energies. The
spatial variation of flux for the thermal groups is
reasonably small within the graphite and ThO, powders
that comprise most of the fuel mixture, but thermal
fluxes are significantly depressed in the kernels of the
coated particles that supply the fissile material. These
particles have a kernel about 0.0300 cm in diameter and
consist mainly of ThO, and 233UO, in a 3:1 ratio. The
kernels are surrounded by a 0.0100-cm-thick carbon’
coating. The average thermal flux in the kernels is about
 

21

2% below that in the rest of the fuel mixture, so that

significant reactivity effects result.

We are preparing to determine the thermal-range
self-shielding for the fuel nuclides from an XSDRN
problem in which the main lattice (cylindrical fuel rods
in a square array) is represented as an equivalent
spherical problem. A typical kernel, its carbon coating,
and the appropriate quantity (smeared) of ThO, and
graphite powders that should be associated with that
kernel constitute the innermost three regions. The
fourth region, consisting of homogenized fuel, extends
to a diameter giving a mean chord length equal to that
-of the actual cylindrical fuel rod. Region 5 contains the
main lattice moderator and has the correct volume,
relative to the fuel. The XSDRN code has been

modified to give multigroup cross sections, averaged.

over the innermost three regions. :
These cross sections take into account the spatial
self-shielding effects of the grainy fuel, in the presence
of the correct amounts of other materials, realistically
disposed. They will be used whenever fuel is explicitly
specified in further problems. In particular, they will be
used in the fuel rod of a cylindrical XSDRN problem, in
. which the rod is correctly specified and the associated
square-lattice cell is cylindricized in the usual manner.
The resulting cell-averaged cross sections will be used in
any further problems where the main lattice is to be

represented without specifying its detailed spatial struc-

ture.

122 PHYSICS ANALYSIS OF MSBR

2.2.1 Radiation Heating in MSR Pumps
J.R. Engel

Some preliminary . calculations were performed to
estimate the amount of radiation heating in the tank of
an MSBR pump. Since this problem is common to all
molten-salt systems, the reference-design MSBR'® was
. chosen to represent the entire class because the heating
there will be greater than in lower-performance systems.
In anticipation of the need to provide cooling for metal

surfaces, a pump tank design was proposed with cooling

shrouds that direct a flow of fuel salt over those
surfaces. Since such provisions would affect the heat
production in the structural members, estimates were
made both with and without the shrouds in place.

10. R. C. Robertson (ed.), Conceptual Design Study of a
Single-Fluid Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor, ORNL-4541, pp.
58-61 (June 1971).

The radiation that heats an MSR pump tank comes
from several sources. One of the more conspicuous is
the source associated with the noble gases and their

“daughters in. the’ gas space above the salt pool. For

molten-salt pumps of the type being considered, it is
estimated that a salt flow of 50 gpm will enter the tank
as leakage around the drive shaft and other seals,
bringing with it noble gases at the same concentrations
as those circulating in the loop. These gases were
assumed to escape into the gas space and to eventually
be swept out by the purge flow of gas that enters
around the pump shaft. In the case where no cooling of
the tank was assumed, the seal leakage was the only
noble-gas source considered. Pump tank cooling could,
no doubt, be accomplished in a variety of ways, but one
convenient salt source is the return flow from the drain
tank. This stream would amount to about 110 gpm per
pump in an MSBR, and at least part of the salt would
have previously been stripped of gaseous fission prod-
ucts in the drain tank. To provide a basis for calcu-
lations, this stream was assumed to flow into the pump
bowl with complete release of the gaseous fission
products to the gas space.

The second major source of radiation in the pump
tank is the salt pool in the surge volume, which was
assumed to be 10 ft3. (The salt inside the volute is a
more intense source, but it is also shielded from the
pump tank by the volute itself and by the salt in the
pool.) The intensity of this source was estimated from
the ‘rate of throughput and the ages of the various
streams entering the pump for the two situations
described above.

A third, but much smaller, source of radiation heating
is the gamma and neutron “shine” on the pump tank
from other components — primarily the reactor vessel —
in the primary loop. Previously reported! ! heating rates
were used to estimate the contribution from this effect.

The heating effectiveness of the sources inside the
pump tank is strongly influenced by the presence or -
absence of the cooling-salt layer and ‘the shroud .
required to direct the.flow over the tank surfaces. With
no cooling, we assumed that all the radiation from the
gas space was directly incident on the surrounding

surfaces, so that beta, as well as gamma, heat was

deposited in the tank walls. In addition, we assumed
that all daughters formed by noble-gas decay would

"deposit ‘on the tank walls and contribute to the heat

source. With salt cooling, the tank wall was presumed to
be completely shielded from the beta radiation emitted

11. MSR Program Semiannu. Progr. Rep. Aug. 31, 1969,
ORNL-4449, pp. 63-67.

 
 

 

by the noble gases and their daughters. However, an

“additional gamma source from the cooling salt itself had

to be considered. (A 1-cm-thick layer of salt was

assumed.) The shielding provided by the shroud and"

cooling salt was neglected in estimating the heating due
to gamma radiation.

Table 2.2 provides a summary of the results that were
obtained. Values are given both forthe energy flux
(beta and/or gamma as appropriate) to the tank wall
and for heat generation in the tank. An exception to
this is the contribution from reactor vessel shine,
because the earlier results were reported only in terms
of heat generation. In estimating the energy flux from
the gas space, surface deposits, and surface cooling, we
assumed that all the radiation’ emitted - would be
incident on some surface (e.g., the volute support
cylinder would radiate beta and gamma energy toward
the tank and vice versa) with a total area of 100 ft2.
The salt pool was treated as a spherical source radiating
toward surfaces 1.4 m away. Of the incident flux, all of
the beta energy and all gamma energy with £ < 0.2
MeV were assumed to be absorbed; only 0.3 of the
higher-energy gamma flux was allowed to deposit in the
metal. Although these estimates of pump-tank heating
are clearly -rough approximations, they indicate that
surface heat fluxes from the pump tank will probably
be in the range of 3000 to 6000 Btu hr! ft™2,
depending on the internal configuration of the pump.
Heat production in the pump impeller and scroll case
may be somewhat higher, but these items are cooled by
the rapidly circulating main salt stream.

2.2.2 MSBE Control-Rod Worths
J. R. Engel

Some preliminary survey calculations were made to
estimate the reactivity worth of several potential
control-rod materials and configurations in the core of
the 150-MW(t) molten-salt breeder experiment.!? The
materials considered included pure graphite and Hastel-
loy N, for which no new compatibility questions would
be raised, and the more conventional neutron poisons,
boron and europium, which we presumed could be
dispersed in graphite to give a usable material. Boron-
impregnated graphite has been produced, so such rods,

would have a substantially longer life but would require
development and would be more expensive.

For each poison evaluation, criticality calculations
were made in one-dimensional cylindrical geometry
using - the 123-group ' neutron-transport program
XSDRN.2® The reference reactor for each case contained
a 2%-in.-diam cylinder of fuel salt on the core center
line. The change in kg produced when part of this salt
was displaced by the control rod was taken as the
reactivity worth of the rod. A solid 2-in.-diam rod was
used for each of the materials, and an additional
calculation was made for a 2Y%- by %-in. cruciform
Hastelloy N rod. Appropriate neutron transport proper-
ties were computed for the central cell with each rod
material in place.

Table 2.3 lists the reactivity worths that were

_ obtained for a single control rod at the core axis. The

while short-lived in a high neutron flux, would pre-

sumably be inexpensive and might be acceptable if used

range of values given for the boron rod illustrates the
kind of worth variation that could be attained with
different loadings. It appears that, except for the pure
graphite rod, acceptably large reactivity effects are
attainable with any of the materials. Graphite rods are
considered, in any case, only as low-worth regulating
rods to provide operational reactivity control, but not
shutdown or long-term shimming. :

Since it is quite likely that multiple control rods
would be required in a reactor to provide for redun-
dancy in safety action, some estimates were made of
the total reactivity worth of four rods in a square array
around the core axis. Figure 2.1 illustrates the decrease
in poisoning that is realized as a rod is displaced radially
from the core axis. The rapid decrease in worth at
positions beyond ~30 cm suggests that greater radial
displacement would be undesirable. (The boundary of

the graphite-moderated region of the reactor lies at 57

cm.) In addition, the increasingly steep flux gradients

tainty of the worth values. Since mutual shadowing
effects depend, to some extent, on the worths of the
control rods, no attempt was made in Fig. 2.1 to
include worth reductions due to shadowing. Thus the
actual worth of clusters of rods near the core axis
would be somewhat lower than indicated by this figure.

plutonium feed.!* We also discussed the effects of
changes in neutron energy spectrum during operation
on the effective cross sections of plutonium. During this
report period we modified our calculational procedures
to minimize errors due to these effects and made an
exploratory calculation of an MSR with initial salt
composition appropriate for startup with plutonium.
ROD code modifications. We have extended the
capability of the ROD code!? for the calculation of the
lifetime performance of molten-salt reactors with batch
processing, to cover cases, such as startup with plu-
tonium fuel, in which the lifetime-averaged reaction-
rate coefficients are not suitable for part of the lifetime,
in particular, the startup period. For such cases, we
have programmed ROD to recalculate the reaction-rate
coefficients at specified intervals during the lifetime.
‘Since the core composition changes most rapidly at the
beginning of life, we have arranged for shorter intervals
to be used for the first cycle and for the beginning of
each cycle. The use of from 20 to 40 intervals has given

- good results for plutonium startup cases. The interval

shadowing effects appear to be less than 10% of the

‘2.2.3 Molten-Salt Converter Reactors
Using Plutonium

H. F. Bauman .

Molten-salt reactors that will breed if processed

continuously can be operated as advanced converters if
the processing is done only at six- to eight-year
intervals.!® In the last semiannual report we described

some calculations for a reactor having a core designed

time, as well as the fuel withdrawal option, has been
included in the “specified variable” options.

Another capability, important in plutonium startup,
is to be able to change the salt composition during the
reactor lifetime. We have programmed ROD so that, if
desired, different salt compositions may be specified,
by cycle, for the first four cycles. In addition, separate
broad-group cross-section sets may be used, by cycle, in
the first three cycles.

Some additional new capabilities in ROD "are the
calculation of a lifetime-averaged fast (damage) flux and
a lifetime fissile material balance. The power normaliza-
tion has been improved by calculating and using average
values for v (neutrons per fission) and the energy release
per fission based on the fuel composition, rather than
the fixed values used previously.

The running time for single cases can now be
shortened by about a third by the use of a restart tape,
from which the atom densities, fission densities, and
fluxes from a previous case can be recalled. For the
study of initial conditions, such as the plutonium initial
loading cases reported following, the ERC search-and/or
equilibrium calculations may now be bypassed.

Initial fissile plutonium loading. The initial fissile
loading for an MSR varies with thorium concentration
in the fuel salt over the attainable range. We studied this
effect by calculating the initial loadings of fissile
plutonium in a fixed-moderator'® MSR with five
different fuel salt compositions ranging from 0 to 14
mole % ThF,. For this study we used a simple reactor
model consisting of a spherical core with ‘0.12 salt
volume fraction surrounded by a 78.4-cm reflector with

the calculations to give the same peak flux of neutrons
with E > 50 keV (damage flux) in each case, namely,
that equivalent to a graphite life of 30 -years in a

fissile material was assumed to be typical first-cycle
plutonium from light-water reactors (23°Pu/?4°Pu/

ognized sensitivity of neutron resonance cross sections
to plutonium concentration, we first estimated the
initial plutonium concentrations for each case and used
XSDRN to prepare nine-group cross sections appro-
priate for those concentrations. ROD was then used to

information on the calculations and key results are
given in Table 2.4.
As expected, the calculated plutonium loadings in-

25

creased sharply with increasing thorium concentration

(decreasing moderator ratio). Concurrently, as the
neutron energy spectrum became harder (as evidenced

"by the fast-flux fraction at the center of the core) the

power distribution flattened, and the core could be
made smaller at constant peak damage flux. This
resulted in more neutrons entering the reflector and
higher fission rates in the 1% salt volume there. A large
increase in reflector fissions is the first symptom of
insufficient moderation in this type of reactor; the large
increase in fissile loading seen between the 10 and 14
mole % ThF, cases suggests that further decreases in
C/Th ratio would result in large increases in fissile
loading.

As shown by the C/Pu ratios in Table 2.4 the
calculated critical concentrations of Pu were somewhat
lower in every case than the concentrations used in
preparing the nine-group cross sections. Because of time
limitations, we did not perform an iteration of pre-
paring new cross sections and recalculating critical
loadings. From some of our earlier cross-section prepa-

. rations we were able to estimate the change in the

effective resonance-group plutonium cross sections that

could be expected from the observed difference in the
C/Pu ratios. The expected change in the 2°Pu reso-
nance-group cross section for case LO8, for example, is

about 25%, as shown in Table 2.4. The error in the

- critical loading from this cause is no doubt significant

(on the order of a few percent) in this case. An iteration
of cross-section preparation, while it would reduce the
error, would not be expected to change the major
conclusion of this study, which is that, in the startup of
a fixed-moderator MSR ‘with recycle plutonium fuel,
the carbon-to-thorium ratio should be not less than
200, and preferably should be between 300 and 400.
Lifetime performance with plutonium and uranium

- feed. In the last semiannual report we presented data
showing that a fixed-moderator MSR designed as a:

breeder with continuous fuel processing can be oper-
ated as a converter with batch processing using enriched
uranium fuel. Qur studies showed further that, if LWR

plutonium fuel is used under the same conditions, a.
- considerable hardening of the neutron spectrum can be
- expected. In order to study this and other effects of

plutonium fuel in MSRs, we have shifted our investiga-

breeder, which was designed to flatten the fast flux
distribution for a particular 233U equilibrium fuel
composition. We selected the same reactor model as
described in the preceding section on plutonium load-
ing. However, in this study the core diameter was
adjusted to obtain the lifetime-averaged (rather than
startup) peak damage flux required for a 30-year core
life at 0.8 plant factor.

In the simple ‘batch process assumed for this study,
the uranium is removed from the fuel salt at the end of
a cycle, by the fluoride volatility process. The re-
maining salt, containing fission products and any
plutonium present, is discarded. (At present, there is no
economical process for recovering plutonium.) To avoid
discarding large quantities of plutonium, we propose,
even in plutonium feed cases, to switch to a uranium
feed near the end of a cycle, permitting most of the
plutonium to burn out.

We have completed an exploratory plutonium feed
case using the revised calculational methods described
in the first section. We used the results of a number of
earlier calculations to select conditions which we

~ believe are near optimum. The reactor lifetime consists

of four 6-efpy (effective full-power year) cycles with a
switch to enriched uranium feed for the last two years
of each cycle. Based on the critical loading study, we
selected a salt composition containing 6 mole %
thorium for the first cycle and 10 mole % for the

. remaining three. The reaction rate coefficients were

recalculated at intervals ranging from 1.5 to 6 months
in the first cycle and from 3 to 12 months in the
remaining cycles. The broad-group cross-section sets
used were changed after the first cycle to account for
the change in carbon-to-thorium ratio and average
plutonium concentrations at this point.

The fuel nuclide inventories, the feed rate, and the
conversion ratio are plotted over the reactor lifetime in

. Fig. 2.2. The conversion ratio increases as 223U builds’

in and averages just under 1.0 for the last two cycles.
The change in critical loading is indicated by a separate
bar on the feed-rate graph at the start of each cycle.
The first bar represents the initial plutonium critical
loading; the next the additional plutonium required for

“criticality as the thorium concentration is raised to

10%. The final two bars represent the excess mixed
uranium (mainly 233U) over that required for criti-

_cality at the start of the final two cycles. This uranium

fraction over the core, rather than the zoned core of the

normal feed is resumed. Only a few kilograms of
plutonium feed were required for the last two cycles,

of enriched 235U feed at the fifth year. Most of the
fissile plutonium is burned out by the end of a cycle,
even in the first cycle, while a considerable amount of
242Py remains to be discarded.

Some of the results of the plutonium feed case are
compared with an otherwise identical enriched-uranium
feed case in Table 2.5. The conditions, particularly the

low first-cycle thorium concentration, are not near

optimum for uranium feed. A uranium feed case given
in the last semiannual report, for example, for a fuel
containing 14 mole % thorium, had an average con-
version ratio of about 0.95 and a fuel cost of 0.76
mill/kWhr. Nevertheless, it is interesting to compare
two cases identical except for the feed material. The
initial critical loading for plutonium is less than half
that for uranium, because of the higher effective cross
sections for plutonium in a well-thermalized spectrum.
This gives a significant cost advantage for plutonium
startup, holding down the fissile inventory charges at
the beginning of the lifetime, when they are most
important to the levelized fuel cost. Perhaps the most
striking observation on these two cases is how little
they differ in performance. The conversion ratios, net
fissile requirements, and fuel costs are all fairly close.
We speculate that, when two well-optimized cases are
available for comparison, we will find even smaller
differences in the performance between these two
feeds.

 
 

3. Systems and Components Development
Dunlap Scott

During this period we narrowed the scope of the
systems and components - development program to
strengthen the efforts in support of. the experimental
programs for the two salt loops now under design and
construction. The coolant-salt technology facility
(CSTF) will replace the Inconel PKP loop used in tests
previously reported,! and the gas system test facility
(GSTF) will provide a means for testing the noble-gas
removal system with an MSBR type of fuel salt. The
industrial study of conceptual designs of steam gen-
erators for use with MSR’s is under way and will
continue; however, the plans for building facilities for
testing steam generator models have been delayed until
a more definite program for building another molten-
salt reactor is established. The study of valves for use
with molten salts has also been suspended indefinitely.

final design of the bubble separator for testing in the
GSTF has a tapered casing with a 44-in. separation
length between the swirl and recovery vane hubs and
gas removal from both hubs. This configuration, which
is shown operating in Fig. 3.1, has a gas void about %
to % in. in diameter and has maintained a stable vortex
in all normal ranges of liquid and gas flow. Figure 3.2
shows the gas removal efficiencies for operation with
31% CaCl, solution with fine bubbles that have passed
through the circulating pump and with coarser bubbles
injected at the pump discharge.
A second dilution experiment starting with 31%
CaCl, solution was conducted to determine if the
CaCl, concentration where bubble coalescence began
was dependent on the type or quantity of gas. The test
was conducted with helium, nitrogen, and argon at gas
flow rates of 0.455, 2.8, and 5.15 scfm. The results of
this experiment were consistent with the results of the
previous dilution experiment,? and bubble coalescence
occurred at concentrations below about 2.7 wt %
CaCl,. The coalescence concentration was independent
of the type and quantity of gas. However, at concen-
trations greater than the coalescence point, the separa-
tion efficiency was higher with the less dense and less

Pressure-drop data were taken on the bubble sepa-
rator and the bubble generator, and from this data a
tentative pressure distribution was prescribed for the
GSTF main piping. The data for the bubble generator
indicated a larger than expected increase in the gas
supply pressure required as the gas flow was increased
from zero to design flow. Efforts to reduce this pressure
increase to a more acceptable level are continuing.

The fabrication of the bubble formation and coales-

cence test rig was completed and testing is in progress.
A schematic drawing of the test rig is shown in Fig. 3.3.
The sample capsule moves vertically with a 1-in. stroke
at frequencies ranging up to about 1600 cpm. The
maximum accelerations would be about 1170 ft/sec? or
36 g's. The test procedure is to shake the capsule at the

‘desired frequency for several seconds to ensure an
equilibrium void fraction and bubble size distribution.

Photographs were then taken during the agitation, when

fluid became relatively clear.

Table 3.1 is a summary of the tests completed to
date. All the capsules were sealed with about 1 atm of
helium overpressure at the operating temperature. The
capsule of LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12%) MSR fuel salt
contained contaminants that made the capsule opaque
during and after agitation. After sitting for a few hours

-the capsule stopped, and at 5-sec intervals until the

the salt again became transparent, with the contami-
nation floating on the liquid surface, deposited on the
capsule wall, and suspended as particles or flocs within
the salt. The contamination prevented us from taking
suitable photographs of this capsule.

Figure 3.4 shows the bubbles produced in the various
test fluids at 1600 cpm and the bubbles remaining in
the fluid after various times after the agitation was
stopped. The relatively large bubbles in the LiF-BeF,
photographs are attached to the wall. The following
conclusions can be drawn from the tests that have been

un to date.

1. In demineralized water, small bubbles coalesce
immediately, and the fluid clears of bubbles in a
fraction of a second after capsule motion stops.

2. The capsules of 41% glycerin—water and 31%
CaCl, contained a relatively high void fraction of very
small bubbles. There was little or no coalescence, and a
significant void fraction of small bubbles remained 20
sec after agitation was stopped.

3. Small bubbles were produced in the LiF-BeF,
capsule as evidenced by the dark appearance during
agitation. There was some coalescence after the agita-
tion was stopped, but significantly less than with
demineralized water. A very low void fraction of
small-diameter bubbles remained after 20 sec at rest.
There was no foaming at the liquid surface. The bubble
separator would be expected to operate at a relatively
high efficiency on a salt of this type.

3.1.3 Bubble Separator Analyses
T. S. Kress

Analyses were started near the end of this reporting
period with the objective of idealizing the swirl-flow
bubble separator to develop analytical expressions that
would be helpful in understanding the performance of
the separator.

The initial idealization essentially consisted of treat-
ing the flow as inviscid. Specifically, the simplifications
included:

"1. energy conservation, -

2. constant axial velocity,

3. free vortex tangential velocity.

Based on these assumptions, separate analyses were

made to determine an equilibrium cavity size and a
theoretical separation efficiency.

The - equilibrium. cavity size, r,, was determined
through an integration of the expression for con-

forces are balanced by viscous drag forces to determine
‘the bubble radial velocity.

3.2 GAS SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY FACILITY
R. H. Guymon

The design of most of the components for the GSTF
is nearing completion. The salt piping was analyzed in

- accordance with design codes specified in the QA plan,?

using an allowable stress of 2700 psi at 1350°F. No
combined thermal-pressure-weight stresses exceeded the
allowable stress. Detailed design of the facility piping is
in progress.

Accurate calculations of the loop pressure drops are
complicated by the proximity of various components.
This, coupled with the desire for flexibility in the test

program, led to the decision to install variable flow
-restrictors - instead of fixed orifices to regulate the

pressure distribution. The design concept of these is
similar to a gate valve. A plate is welded perpendicular
to the axis of the 5-in. pipe. The plate contains an
opening 1% in. wide by 4% in. long. A 2-in. pipe,
welded to the outside of the 5-in. pipe at this location,

- allows access for the insertion of a movable plate to

easily represented, and effects of turbulent diffusion of

bubbles away from the cavity, neglected in the above
analysis, might also be conveniently included.

cover a portion of this opening. The movable plate is

held against the permanent plate by the hydraulic force:

of the flowing salt. The 2-in. access: pipe will be sealed

by the use of clamps and gaskets during the initial

operation with water, but a cap will be welded on to

seal the access pipe during salt operation. Adjustment is -

possible only when the system is drained.
In order to calibrate these variable flow restrictors

and to obtain performance curves for the modified salt

pump (the MSRE Mark 2 pump will be used with an
MSRE coolant’ pump impeller), the loop will be
operated initially with water.

The final instrument application drawings are nearly
complete, an instrument tabulation has been made, and
the specifications for many of the instruments have
been established. The first drafts of the control circuit

drawings and panel layout drawings have been com-

pleted.

A preliminary system design description (PSDD) has
been prepared for the GSTF and is ready for publica-
tion. The PSDD will be kept up-to-date and expanded
as the design progresses and will be used as the primary
control document for the facility.

3.3 MOLTEN-SALT STEAM GENERATOR
INDUSTRIAL PROGRAM

J. L. Crowley

Contract negotiations were completed with Foster
Wheeler for a four-task conceptual design study of
molten-salt steam generators as described previously.*
The contract was approved by the AEC’s Oak Ridge
Operations Office in February. The four tasks are as
follows: (I) conceptual design of a steam generator for
the ORNL 1000-MW(e) reference steam cycle; (II)
feasibility study and conceptual design of steam gen-
erators using lower feedwater temperature; (III) con-

ceptual design of a steam generator for a molten-salt

reactor of about 150 MW(t); (IV) description of a
research and development program for the task: II
steam generator. :

Foster Wheeler began work in October and is proceed-
_ing on a concept arrangement study for task I. Foster
Wheeler will select a steam generator arrangement and
configuration with ORNL’s concurrence before pro-
ceeding with the conceptual design analysis. According
- to the work plan, task I will be complete by October
1972, with the remaining tasks complete by April 1974.

~The mechanical design of the CSTF is complete, and
the instrument and controls’ design is 90% complete.
The control panel drawings have been approved for

~ construction, and panel fabrication is 30% complete.

The electrical drawings are 95% complete. The photo-

* graph in Fig. 3.5 shows the major components of the

CSTF, which is being constructed in the existing
enclosure of the old PKP-1 pump test stand. With the
exception of the drain line, freeze valve, and drain tank,
installation of the salt-wetted components into the
facility is complete. The drain tank was fabricated
earlier and was sent to the Reactor Chemistry Division
for salt purification ‘and loading activity while the
construction of the facility was continued. The re-
maining construction activity includes installation of
thermocouples, preheaters, the cover-gas and off-gas

lines, and the electrical and gas control equipment.

A variable port to throttle salt flow was installed in
the inlet line within the salt monitoring vessel. The
throttle can be operated through a slip seal in the gas
space at the top of the vessel. Water flow tests of this
unit before installation indicated satisfactory flow
control at representative pressure differentials.

The concentric tube economizer for the cold-trap
supply and return lines was tested with hot tap water

, flowing through the inner tube and cold tap water

through the annulus. Flow through the annulus was
held constant at the expected salt flow rate of 0.18 gpm
(Re = 775), while the flow rate through the inner tube
was varied from 0.17 to 0.6 gpm (Re = 2800 to
10,000). A Wilson plot of these data indicates an
annular heat transfer coefficient of 290 Btu hr™' ft™2
(°F)! as opposed to a coefficient of 118 Btu hr! ft~2
(°F), calculated for laminar flow by use of the
relationship # = 6.2K/D. The better-than-expected heat
transfer coefficient indicated by these tests is probably
due to a combination of errors in the Wilson plot
technique at these low Reynolds numbers and to
turbulence generated by the centering devices between

© the inner and outer tubes. From a comparison of the

physical properties of water and sodium fluoroborate, it

~ appears that the overall heat transfer coefficient of the

economizer will be ~35% less with the salt. With this
lower overall coefficient, the temperature of the salt
supply to the cold trap can be lowered by ~200°F in
the economizer. when the cold trap is operated at a
maximum AT of 100°F. :

the CSTF after refurbishing and cold shakedown testing
are completed. The shaft seals have been relapped, and
the shaft subassembly is being dynamically balanced.

The pump rotary assembly for the CSTF will be

diameter used .in CSTF design calculations and will .

result in a head increase of approximately 5% over
previous estimates.® The larger impeller in combination
with the CSTF volute will provide a 95-ft head and 820
gpm at 1765 rpm. The available 75-hp motor will be
loaded to approximately 48.5 hp.

During disassembly of the spare MSRE rotary as--

sembly, we encountered problems with the seal weld

which joins the shield plug to the bearing housing. The

outer lip of the seal weld was too short and too thick to
permit field removal of the weld and to provide for the
necessary rewelding during assembly. It was necessary
to remove the seal weld by machining in a vertical
 

boring mill at the Y-12 Machine Shop and to fabricate a
stainless steel extension for the outer seal lip. These
modifications were completed, and the design drawings
were corrected to show the improved design.

Pump for the gas system test facility. The GSTF will
use .an impeller of the MSRE coolant-salt pump design

"and the modified volute and pump tank of the MSRE

Mark 2 fuel salt pump. Because of the difficulty of
predicting the pump characteristics® of a mismatched
impeller-volute combination, tests will be run in the
facility while operating with water to obtain several
characteristic data points. From these data we can
determine the desired impeller diameter.

During these tests with water the shield plug will be
replaced with a spacer to support two displacement
transducers that will be used to measure the pump shaft

35

deflections as a function of pump operating conditions.

Prior to the water tests, static measurements of radial
load vs shaft deflection will be made, from which the
deflection characteristics of the impeller-volute com-
bination when operated with salt can be deduced. This
information is needed to establish the running clear-
ances in the affected shaft and impeller labyrinths.

3.5.2 ALPHA Pump

The ALPHA pump operated satisfactorily during the

past six months in corrosion test facility MSR-FCL-2
and accumulated about 3900 hr of operation at 4800
rpm pumping 4 gpm of sodium fluoroborate at 850°F.
The oil leakage from the lower rotating shaft seal
averaged about 2 cc/day throughout the operating
period. ‘The oil leakage from the upper shaft seal
increased from about 3 cc/day to 37 cc/day during the
first 1000 hr of operation but has remained near 30
cc/day since then. The AP across the rotating face of
the oil seals is near zero for the lower seal and about 6
psi for the upper seal.

Lubricating- and cooling-oil flow rates and tempera-
tures measured with the pump operating at the normal
MSR-FCL-2 design conditions specified above are
presented below:

Type of oil Gulfspine35
Lubricating oil flow 0.2 gpm
Cooling oil flow : 0.5 gpm
Oil inlet temperature 75°F

Lube oil outlet temperature 92°F

. Cooling oil outlet temperature . 82°F

The pump coastdown time was observed while pump-
ing salt in the MSR-FCL-2 by deenergizing the clutch
control of the Adjusto-Spede drive motor. The pump
speed decreased from 4800 rpm to 1000 rpm in 3% sec

under these’ conditions. This information was used to
establish a 3-sec delay before permitting the automatic
controls to scram the loop during a dip in the electrical
power supply.

As reported previously, the lower shaft seal for this

‘pump was equipped with elastomeric O-rings made of

Viton in an attempt to obtain longer reliable leak-free
operation than provided by the previously used buna N
rings. The original buna N rings failed due to attack
from dilute BF;, whose source is the sodium fluoro-
borate in the pump tank. To obtain additional reli-
ability information on Viton, we installed a sample
O-ring of Viton (Parker compound 77-545) and one of .
buna N in the dilute BFj-helium effluent from the
lower seal region of the pump. After 2000 hr of
operation at room temperature in this dilute mixture
(0.1% BF), the rings were examined visually and
hardness measurements were made. There was no
apparent degradation of the Viton, but the buna N had
hardened and cracked noticeably. Hardness data taken
for both exposed and unexposed samples are:

Shore durometer A
(reading)
Buna N, unexposed 65-67
Buna N, exposed to dilute BF3-helium 85-87
Viton, unexposed 68-73
Viton, exposed to dilute BF 3-helium 65-70

mixture

The exposed sample rings were reinstalled to obtain
further exposure to the dilute BF;-helium mixture.

The difficulties experienced with hollow metal O-ring
gaskets’ that seal the bearing housing to the pump bowl
induced us to return to a buffered, solid-ring-joint

. gasket design. Calculations showed that the present

flanges and ‘bolts have adequate strength for the ring
joint design. Because of the precision needed to
maintain running clearance between impeller and

~ volute, the tolerances on the gasket and the grooves

have been reduced to lower values than are required by
the ANSI standard. These changes will be incorporated
in the pump during some future scheduled shutdown.

Replacement of the lower shaft elastomer seal with a
metallic bellows seal® is also planned at some future
date. This has caused the mechanical redesign of several
components of the pump rotary element. The shaft was
also redesigned to increase its stiffness in the vicinity of
the lower bearing and seal.

be used to prepare molten-salt mixtures for various
chemical and physical properties tests. The purpose of
the device is to provide more thorough mixing of the

- molten salt than can be accomplished by present

methods, which involve bubbling a gas through the salt.

The mixer, shown in Fig. 3.6, is designed to operate
from 900 to 1400°F, 0 to 2 atm absolute pressure, and
150 to 500 rpm. The mixing vessel is joined to the
bearing housing with a solid copper wire O-ring, and the
bearing housing is joined to the drive coupling
diaphragm with a Teflon O-ring to form a single
enclosed volume. The mixer shaft is confined entirely
within this enclosed volume. The torque to the mixer
shaft is transmitted through the drive coupling
diaphragm with two 10-pole permanent magnets. The

37

external, or driving, magnet is mounted on the shaft of
a Y-hp dc motor, and the internal, or driven, magnet is
mounted on the mixer shaft. The mixer shaft is
supported on a full-complement angular-contact ball
bearing with Haynes alloy No. 25 balls and races. This
bearing must carry approximately 75 1b of axial thrust
imposed by the magnets and a negligible radial load.
The Graphitar—Hastelloy N lower journal bearing will
also. have a low radial load. The impeller is overhung
below these two bearings.

The mixing vessel, made of stainless steel, has a nickel
liner for containing the salt. Penetrations into the vessel
through the bearing housing are (1) gas inlet, (2) gas
outlet, (3) thermocouple probe, (4) fill line, and (5)
access line for either a sampler or a liquid-level
measuring probe to be used when filling the nickel liner
with salt.

4.1 TRANSIENT AND CONTROL STUDIES
OF THE MSBR SYSTEM )
USING A HYBRID COMPUTER

0. W. Burke
The hybrid computer model! of the MSBR system

(including the proposed system controllers for control-

ling the secondary salt flow rate, the primary salt
temperature at the reactor outlet, and the steam

- pressure at the throttle) has been developed, and it has

been used to run a number of transients. The draft of
the report covering the model development and tran-
sient runs has been completed, and the final report is
being published. Some of the more interesting tran-
sients that were run and their results shall be discussed
briefly. The severity of the transients that can be run on
this simulation model is somewhat limited by the
nature of the steam generator model (the calculational
time step of the discrete time model is 0.5 sec).

The transients were run in order to determine the
system response times, the rates of change of tempera-
tures, and whether the salt temperatures approached
the freezing points.

Steady-state runs were made for power levels ranging
from 100% design power down to 30% in increments of
10%. Of most interest in these runs was whether or not
the primary or secondary salt approached its respective

1. MSR Program Semiannu. Progr. Rep. Aug. 31, 1971,

~ORNL-4728, p. 38.

freezing point at any of these power levels. The results
showed that the minimum températures in both salt
systems were well above the freezing points for all
cases. So CL

A number of fast changes in'load demand were run in
order to observe the resulting system response. The
rates of change of the system temperatures were of
interest. The secondary salt temperature at the steam

© generator outlet changed at a rate of approximately

4.5°F per second for the case when the load demand
was ramped from full load to 40% full load in 1% sec.
The limitations of the model precluded higher rates of

* change. Some cases involving changes in reactivity were

run. As a rough approximation of inserting two safety
rods (each. worth 1.5% in 6K/K), —3% 8K/K was
ramped in in 15 sec. For this case the fission power had
reduced to 10% of full power in approximately 3 sec.

As a rough approximation of a fuel addition accident,
+0.2% 8K/K was ramped in in 1.5 sec. For this case, in
the absence of a safety system, the power peaked at
approximately 2300 MW(e) and was back down to
normal in approximately 10 sec. The primary salt
temperature at the reactor outlet peaked at approxi-
mately 1390°F.

Development of a model capable of simulating faster
transients and of covering a wider range of operating
conditions is being considered. Some accuracy would be

sacrificed in the steam generator simulation, but it is

hoped that multiple loop simulation will be possible.

This model should be capable of operating in real time.

5. Heat and Mass Transfer and Physical Properties

5.1 HEAT TRANSFER
J. W. Cooke

Previous studies of heat transfer to a proposed MSBR

+ fuel salt (LiF-BeF,-ThF,;-UF,; 67.5-20-12-0.5 mole %)

have led to the suggestion that, in the Reynolds
modulus range 2000 to 4000, the heat transfer coeffi-
cient varies along the test section in a manner which
may be related to a delay in transition to turbulent
flow.! Data obtained over a salt inlet temperature range
1080 to 1390°F have confirmed that the delay is
abetted by the stabilizing influence of heating for a
fluid having a large negative temperature coefficient.?
Additional experimental results have recently been
obtained with the gas-pressurized heat transfer system
at lower salt temperatures which further substantiate
the effect of temperature.

The data for salt inlet temperatures ranging from 964
to 994°F are presented in Table 5.1. Attempts to
operate at inlet temperatures nearer the salt melting
temperature (~905°F) were not successful due to
freezing in colder sections of the system. In Fig. 5.1,
the heat transfer function, Ng_,, is plotted as a

J. J. Keyes, Jr.

function of the Reynolds modulus Ng. These data
are up to a factor of 2 lower than the values predicted
by the Hausen correlation,? the greatest deviation ocur-
ring at the lowest Reynolds modulus of 3048.

A plot of the wall and bulk salt temperature
distributions along the 2-ft heated length and 2-ft
adiabatic length of the test section is shown in Fig. 5.2
for runs 5-A and 7-A. These distributions show clearly
that the transition from laminar to turbulent flow has
not been completed within the 4-ft length of the test
section (L/D = 270). In particular, the slow decay of
the wall temperature in the adiabatic length of the test
section for run 7-A (no entrance length) suggests the
absence of significant eddy diffusivity contribution to
the heat transfer (i.e., laminar flow), resulting in a
strong radial temperature gradient in the salt which

equilibrates slowly in the exit length. The abrupt
increase in the wall temperatures near the end of the
heated test section has not yet been fully explained.
The only significant change in operating conditions
between the present series of runs and earlier runs is the
lower salt temperature, with an accompanying increase
in viscosity (u = 50 Ib ft™ hr!) and in its first
derivative [du/dt = 0.20 Ib ft™' hr! (°F)7']. The
results (e.g., low heat transfer associated with laminar
flow) demonstrate the stabilizing influence of heating a

fluid with a large negative temperature coefficient of
viscosity.

During these runs, the wetting characteristics of the
salt were measured using the wetting detection probe
described previously.* The salt was found to wet the

" Hastelloy N surface (contact angle = 20°). We plan to

purify the salt so that the contact angle is greater than
100°. Under nonwetting conditions, a gas film might be
trapped along the heat transfer surface and severely
restrict the transfer of heat into the salt.

52 WETTING STUDIES
J. W. Cooke

A new technique involving measurement of bubble
pressure. described previously,? is being used to study
the wetting characteristics of molten salts. Two prelimi-
nary experiments with samples from the same batch of
the salt mixture (LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF,; 67.5-20-12-0.5
mole %) showed the salt wetting a Hastelloy N surface:
(contact angle <70°) at 1500°F, and at lower tempera-
tures after addition of 1 wt % of the oxidizing agent,
anhydrous nickel fluoride. Such wetting behavior was
attributed to a suspected large oxygen content (~400
ppm) in this bath of salt.

The salt mixture was reprocessed and the oxygen
content reduced to 85 ppm. The chemical composition
of the salt is given in Table 5.2. Some 3800 observa-
tions of the contact angle of the salt with respect to a
Hastelloy N surface were made over a 43-hr period.
Results are presented in Table 5.3. Initially, the salt did
not wet the surface (0 = 195°); however, over a period
of 18.5 hr at 1000°F the salt gradually became partially
wetting and then wetting (§ = 30°). The salt was then
heated to 1230°F and began to partially wet (§ = 100°)
the tip surface. The salt remained partially wetting for

about 6 hr at 1230°F. At this point the system was
cooled down and transferred to a vacuum dry box.

The initial nonwetting of the Hastelloy N surface by
the salt was indication of a salt mixture of high purity
and a clean, vacuum-tight system. The gradual wetting
of the surface was due, we believe, to the effect of
moisture in the helium gas, probably in forming an
oxide film on the surface. Prior experience by other
groups using titanium scrubbers to purify helium gas
has shown that some moisture may be evolved from the
titanium sponge during its initial operation.

We plan to repeat the measurements with a new salt
specimen after a complete chemical analysis is made of
the helium gas supply.

5.3 MASS TRANSFER TO CIRCULATING BUBBLES
T. S. Kress

The mass transfer coefficients between bubbles having
a limited size range and liquids flowing cocurrently in a
2-in.-diam pipeline were found experimentally to follow
the correlations
Sh/Sc1/2 = 0.34 Re®-%4 (d,/D)'-°.. 5.1)
The Reynolds modulus exponent (0.94) in Eq. (5.1)
was found to be larger than expected when compared,
on an equivalent power dissipation basis, with mass
transfer data for bubbles and liquids in agitated
vessels.6 The agitated-vessel data are correlated by use
of a Reynolds modulus exponent of 0.69. Conse-

. §

quently, to assist in resolving the difference, an analysis
was undertaken to provide : a theoretical basis for the

" exponent.

A considerable amount of theoretical and experi-
mental mass transfer information exists for the case of
bubbles moving steadily through a fluid with some
distinct relative velocity. The mass transfer equations
established and generally accepted are the Frossling
type, which, for large Schmidt moduli, take the forms

Shy, ~ Re, 1/2 Scl/2 » .
(5.2
Shy ~ Re, 1/2 Sc1/3 )

for mobile and rigid interfaces respectively.

A small bubble suspended in a turbulent field is
subjected to random inertial forces created by the
turbulent fluctuations. Under the influence of a given
force, if sufficiently persistent, the bubble may achieve
its terminal velocity and move steadily through the
liquid before being redirected by another of the random
forces. If an ‘‘average” value representing the bubble
relative velocity in such a turbulent field could be
determined, then a convenient formulation would be
the use of this velocity as a measure of an average
bubble Reynolds modulus, staying within the confines

of the well-established relative-flow Fréssling-type equa-
tions [Egs. (5.2)] to determine the mass transfer
behavior.
The movement of the bubbles through the liquid will
be resisted primarily by viscous stresses. The drag force
on a sphere moving steadily through a liquid at relative
velocity, v,, is often expressed in terms of a drag
coefficient, C;, by the equation

F _CaApvy? Gym? Re? 3)
TdT 2g, 8g

in which the drag coefficient is itself a function of the
bubble Reynolds modulus. In relative flows, however,
the drag coefficient—Reynolds modulus correlation
depends on the particular Reynolds modulus range.
Frequently, two regimes of flow are identified, with the
division occurring at Re, = 2. Common correlations for
the drag coefficients in these two regimes are given
below.

For Re, <2,

C4 =24/Re;, and Fy = 3nu* Rey [gp
For 2<Re, <200, ~
C= 18.5/Re, 0-6 and Fy = 18.572 Re, 1-4/8g,p.(5.5)

An expression has been developed® for the inertial
force experienced by a bubble in a turbulent fluid:

. Cc

It might be reasonable to determine “mean” bubble
velocities from a balance between the inertial force and
the drag force for later substitution into the Frassling
equations. If it is postulated that the above two regimes
also exist for bubbles in a turbulent field, then two
different sets of equations describing the mass transfer
will result. Since the inertial force depends on the
bubble size, a dispersion of bubbles with a distribution
of sizes may have bubbles in one regime or in both
regimes simultaneously, and the mass transfer behavior
may be described by one set of equations or take on

42

by Eq. (5.4). A balance between the inertial and drag
forces, F; = F,, would. then give for the bubble
Reynolds modulus .

Rey ~ (d/D)8/3 Ret1/6 . 5.7

By this formulation, the bubble relative-flow Rey-

‘nolds modulus depends only on the ratio d/D and on

the pipe Reynolds modulus which, for a given bubble
size, establish the turbulence level. The Sherwood
modulus for mass transfer can therefore be determined -
as a function of these variables by substitution of Eq.
(5.7) into the Frossling-type equations. Making the
conversion Sh = (D/d) Shy, and substituting Eq. (5.7)
into Eq. (5.2) gives for the mobile- and rigid-interface
pipe Sherwood moduli applicable to cocurrent turbu-

* lent flow,
Sh ~ Scl/2 Re®-92 (d/D)1/3 , (5.8)
Sh ~ Scl/3 Re0-92 (@/D)1/3 , (5.9)

respectively.

Consequently, in this regime, a theoretical pipe
Reynolds modulus exponent is 0.92, in comparison
with the experimentally determined value of 0.94. The

theoretical bubble diameter dependence, (d/D)!/3,

characteristics of a combination of the two. The mass .

transfer equations resulting for the two separate regimes
are given below.

Regime 1: Re, <2

If the bubble motion were predominantly governed -

by the regime Re; < 2, the drag force would be given

however, is less than the experimentally determined
linear variation. Calderbank and Moo-Young? point out
that the linear variation they observed for bubbles in
this size range probably resulted from a transition from
rigid to mobile interfacial conditions, because small
bubbles universally tend to behave as rigid spheres,
while larger bubbles require the presence of sufficient
surface active ingredients to immobilize their surface. If
such a transition is the reason for the linear variation in
this instance, then the bubble diameter dependence in
Eq. (5.1) is applicable only over the range of the
measurements, 0.01 <d,; < 0.05 in.

"Regime 2: Re, >2
If the bubble motion were predominantly in the
regime Re, > 2, the drag force would be given by Eq.
(5.5). The balance, F; = F;, would then give

Re, ~ (d/D)8/4-2 Rell/8.4 (5.10)

7. P. H. Calderbank and M. B. Moo-Young, The Continuous
Phase Heat and Mass-Transfer Properties of Dispersions, Chem,
Eng. Sci. 16, 37 (1961).
 

 

The relative-flow bubble Reynolds modulus in this
regime still depends on the variables that establish the
turbulence level, but the dependence is different from
that of regime 1. When substituted into the Fréssling
equations for mobile and rigid interfaces, the results are

Sh ~ Sc1/2 Re0-66 (d/D)-0-2/4.2 , (5.11)

Sh ~ Scl/3 Re0-66 (d/D)~0-214-2 , (5.12)
¢
respectively.

For this regime the Reynolds modulus exponent is
0.66. The comparison of this exponent with that
expected from agitated-vessel data (0.69) is interesting.
However, the writer feels that the apparent difference
observed between mass transfer in agitated vessels and
flow in conduits is more likely due to a difference in
the relative influence of gravitational forces in the two
systems rather than to a difference in the controlling
flow regime.

Part 2. Chemistry

W. R. Grimes .

The chemical development activities described below

continue to address themselves to chemical problems

posed in design and operation of molten-salt reactor
systems.

Experimental study of specimens and materials from
MSRE has been completed except for a small number
of verification or recheck analyses. The only effort
devoted to the MSRE “postmortem” consists in pre-
paring final reports of the complex fission: product

behavior in that system. This documentation will be

completed in the very near future.

Study of possible mechanisms of intergranular attack
upon MSRE metallic components (conducted in close
cooperation with the MSRP metallurgists, and reported
in more detail in Part 3 of this report) engages an
increasing fraction of the chemical program. Studies
completed to date have indicated tellurium as the most
likely offending material. Many exposures of pertinent

. metals to tellurium (and to other potentially harmful
. fission products and contaminants) are under way for

various times and at varying contaminant concentra-
tions. In addition, tools and techniques for more
sophisticated study of exposure to tellurium and for
detailed study of metal tellurides are under develop-
ment. It is expected that all these efforts will be further
augmented in the future.

The behavior of hydrogen isotopes in molten salts and

metals constitutes a substantial fraction of the chemi-

cal development effort. Solubility of Hj in 2LiF-BeF,
has been established at 600°C; this study should be
concluded within the next reporting period. Definitive
data are now being obtained on permeation of metals
by hydrogen isotopes at the low pressures of interest,
and useful preliminary data on reduction of such
permeation by coatings and films are becoming avail-

able. This study (which is valuable not only to MSRP
but to the Controlled Thermonuclear program and to
any system requiring management of tritium at elevated
temperatures) will continue to have a high priority.
Study of possible mechanisms capable of holdup of
tritium (especially in fluoroborate systems) to allow
time for its controlled recovery continués to show
promise. A related effort — aimed at improved under-
standing of fluoroborate chemistry and of corrosion by
fluoroborates — is still under way at a modest funding
level. :

Study of protactinium chemistry during this period
has been confined to selective precipitation of oxides.

Such processing (to remove a major fraction of protac-

tinium from the reactor fuel without precipitation of
any other species) continues to appear feasible at
temperatures near 550°C. Small-scale studies ‘of this
process are now considered complete except for con-
firmatory experiments and for a more accurate defini-
tion of the potential of the Pa**-Pa%* couple in molten
fluorides.

The principal emphasis of analytical chemical devel-
opment programs has been placed on methods for use
in semiautomated operational control of molten-salt
breeder reactors, for example, the development of
inline analytical methods for the analysis of MSR fuels,
for reprocessing streams, and for gas streams. These
methods include electrochemical and spectrophoto-
metric means for determination of the concentration of
U3* and other ionic species in fuels and coolants and
adaptation of small on-line computers to electro-
analytical methods. Parallel efforts have been devoted
to the development of analytical methods related to
assay and control of the concentration of water, oxides,
and tritium in fluoroborate coolants.

6.1 SOME FACTORS AFFECTING THE
DEPOSITION INTENSITY OF NOBLE-METAL
FISSION PRODUCTS

E.L.Compere E.G.Bohlmann S.S. Kirslis

#

The loss of noble-metal fission products from circu-
lating fuel salt and their deposition on reactor surfaces
have been recognized since the examination of the first
specimens from the MSRE. However, a considerable
uncertainty has remained concerning the factors
affecting their deposition intensity. Certainly a mass
transfer step is involved, but — because in the standard
surveillance arrays, there were differing flow conditions
for metal and graphite specimens — sticking factors,
flow terms, and other factors could not readily be
extricated from the data. Nor is this completely
achieved in the discussion to follow. However, the final
surveillance specimen array!*? (Fig. 6.1), in addition to
containing four uranium capsules for neutron capture
experiments, also contained sets of paired metal and
graphite specimens, with differing axial positions, sur-
face roughness, and adjacent flow velocities. Because
flow conditions were the same or essentially so for
metal-graphite pairs, the hydrodynamically controlled
mass transport effects if simple should cancel in
comparisons, and differences can be attributed to
differences in what is commonly called sticking factor.
The sample pairs are listed below in order of increasing
turbulence. :

Flow. In the noncentral regions of the core, the flow
to a fuel channel had to pass through the grid of lattice
bars, and according to measurements reported on

models, the velocity in the channels was 0.7 fps with a
Reynolds number of 1000. However, the flow varied
with the square root of head loss, implying that
nonlaminar entrance conditions extended over much of
these channels.

The lattice bars did not extend across the central
region, which included several otherwise standard fuel

channels and circular annuli with rod thimbles and

surveillance specimens. Consequently, the available flow
head and resultant velocities were greater in the central
region than in the noncentral region.

The flow through central fuel channels was indicated
by model studies to be 3.7 gpm, equivalent to 2.66 fps,
or a Reynolds number of 3700; the associated head loss
due to turbulent flow can thus be calculated as 0.45 ft.
In the adjacent parallel channels for rod thimbles and
surveillance specimens, the same driving force across the
2.6- to 2.0-in. annulus yields a velocity of 2.6 fps and a
Reynolds number of 3460. These flows are clearly
turbulent. Co : !

Flow in the circular annulus around the surveillance
specimen basket essentially controlled the pressure
drops, driving the more restricted flows around and
through various specimens within the basket.

At the bottom of the basket cage was a hollow
graphite cylinder (No. 7-3, Table 6.1) 1'4 in. OD, %
in. ID, containing a %-in-OD Hastelloy N closed
cylinder (No. 7-1, Table 6.2). The velocity in the
annulus was estimated as 0.27 fps, with an associated
Reynolds number of DVp/u = 0.0104 X 0.27 X
141/0.00528 = 75; this flow was, therefore, clearly
laminar. This value, about 10% of that originally
indicated,! was obtained by considering flow through
three resistances in series, respectively, 20 holes in
parallel, 4 in. diam by % in. long; then 6 holes in
parallel, ¥, in. diam by , in. long; then an annulus %} ¢

which should develop along the outer part of the
basket, was assumed. The laminar annulus flow formula

given in Perry's Chemical Engineer's Handbook, 1V,
Table 5-11, was used.

In the annulus between the outside of the graphite
cylinder and the basket, the velocity was estimated to
be about 1.5 fps; the associated Reynolds number is

© 2200, and the flow was either laminar or in the

transition region. At the top of the cage was a Hastelloy
N cylinder (No. 14, Table 6.2; No. 4 in Fig. 6.1) of
similar external dimension which presumably experi-

enced similar flow conditions on the outside. This

specimen was closed at the top and had a double wall.

- Inside was a bar containing electron microscope screens.

The liquid around the bar within the cylinder was

stagnant, and gas was trapped in the upper part of the
. specimen.

‘Below this and above the midplane of the specimen

48

cage were located respective graphite (Table 6.1, No. -

12) and double-walled Hastelloy (Table 6.2, No. 13)

~ cylinders, with connecting ';-in.-diam bores. Flow
* through this tube is believed to have been transition or

possibly turbulent flow, though doubtless less turbulent
than around the specimen exterior. The exterior of the
1-in.-OD cylinders was wrapped with ! ¢-in. Hastelloy
N wire on Y%-in. pitch as a flow disturbance. Flow in
the annulus between the specimen exterior and the
basket was undoubtedly the most turbulent of any
affecting the set of specimens.

The data from the various specimens are presented in i

Table 6.1 for graphite and in Table 6.2 for Hastelloy N.

All activity and inventory data correspond to reactor
shutdown (Dec. 12, 1969). In order to provide a
common basis of comparison for all observations of
deposited activity — of whatever isotope on whatever
surface — the observed activity of an isotope per unit

"area has been divided by the quotient obtained by

dividing total MSRE inventory activity of the isotope
by the total MSRE surface area, graphite and metal (3.1
X 10° cm?).

The resulting relative deposition intensities should be
the same for all isotopes depositing the same fraction of
their inventory by whatever means on unit surface of
whatever kind. Thus the deposition intensity of various

. isotopes on either graphite or metal can be compared

freely. Complete and even deposition of an isotope on
all surfaces would give a value of 1.0 everywhere.
However, deposition intensities vary with mass trans-
port and sticking factor, etc., in various regions, so that
the average relative intensity (summed over all system

- areas) should fall between 0 and 1.0.

We saw no effect of surface roughness, which ranged
from 5 to 125 pin. rms on both metal or graphite, so
this will not be further considered here.

Fission recoil. Because the specimens were adjacent to
fissioning salt in the core, some fission products should
recoil into the surface.> We calculate that where the
fission density equals the average for the core, the
relative impingement intensity of recoiling fission frag-
ments [(recoil atoms/cm? )/(reactor production/surface
area)]. ranges from 0.0036 for light fragments to 0.0027
for heavy fragments. The ratio will be higher (around
0.005) where the fission density is highest.

Salt-seeking nuclides. Relative deposition intensities
for salt-seeking nuclides (°*Zr, 14! Ce) are of the order
of the calculated impingement intensities or less: for
95Zr, 0.001-to 0.0027 on graphite and 0.0003 to
0.0008 on metal; for '%!Ce, 0.0010 to 0.0090 on
graphite and 0.0006 to 0.0016 on metal. The 284-day
144Ce js consistent with this, on a current basis after
adjustment for prior inventory as shown in the table
footnotes.

There also appears to be some dependence on axial
location, with higher values nearer the center of the
core. Thus all of the salt-seeking nuclides observed on
surfaces could have arrived there by fission recoil; the
fact that remaining deposition intensities on metal
surfaces are consistently less than impingement densi-
ties indicates that many atoms that impinge on the
surface may sooner or later return to the salt.

Nuclides with noble-gas precursors. The nuclides with

noble-gas precursors (8°Sr, '37Cs, !*°Ba, and to a
slight extent, '4!Ce) are, after formation, also salt
seekers. They are found to be deposited on metal to
about the same extent as isotopes of salt-seeking
elements, doubtless by fission recoil. However, noble-
gas precursors can diffuse into graphite before decay,

providing an additional and major path into graphite. It

may be seen that values for 9Sr, *37Cs, and !*°Ba for

the graphite samples are generally an order of magni-

tude or more greater than for the salt-seeking elements.

It appears evident that the deposition intensity on
graphite of the isotopes with noble-gas precursors was
higher on the outside than on the inside, both of
specimen 7 and specimen 12. Flow was also more
turbulent outside than inside, and atomic mass transfer
coefficients should be higher. [Flows are not well
enough known to accurately compare the outside of the

lower specimen (No. 7-3) with the inside of the upper

. graphite tube specimen (No. 12-1).]

Appreciably more 3.1-min 8°Kr and 3.9-min '37Xe
should enter the graphite than 16-sec !*°Xe or 2-sec

141Xe, but the '37Cs values are considerably lower
than for 89Sr. Only about 14% of the '37Cs inventory
was formed during runs 19 and 20. With this correction;
however, *37Cs deposition intensities still are less than
observed for strontium. It has been noted previously*
that the major part of cesium formed in graphite will
diffuse back into the salt much more strongly than the
less volatile strontium; this presumably accounts for the
lower 2 7Cs intensity.

At first glance the “fast flow” values for 8%Sr on
graphite appear somewhat high: similar deposition
intensity on all flow channel graphite would account
for the major part of the 8°Sr inventory, while salt
analysis® for the period showed that the salt contained
~82% of the 8°Sr. But the discrepancy is not unaccept-
able, since most core fuel channels had lower velocity
and less turbulent, possibly laminar, flow.

On the inside of the closed tube the deposition of

 salt-seeking daughters of noble gases was much higher in
the gas space than in the salt-filled region. This is
consistent with collection of 8°Kr in the gas space and
relative immobility of strontium deposits on surfaces
not washed by salt.

Noble metals: niobium and molybdenum. Turning to
the noble-metal fission products we note that °SNb
deposited fairly strongly and fairly evenly on all
surfaces. The data are not inconsistent with post-
mortem examination of reactor components. Molyb-
denum (°?Mo) deposited considerably more ‘strongly
on metal than on graphite (limited graphite data).

Because the deposition intensity of molybdenum on.

metal is similar to that of ®?Sr on graphite, which is
attributed to atomic krypton diffusion through the salt

49

boundary layer, it may be that molybdenum could also '

have been transported in appreciable part by an atomic
mechanism, and presumably had a high sticking factor

on metal (~1 7). Under similar flow conditions, the -

decomposition intensity of molybdenum on graphite is
much less; hence the sticking factor on graphite is
doubtless much below unity. Postmortem component
examination found that the °?Tc daughter also was
more intensely deposited on metal than on graphite.
The widely varying ®°Mo values reported® for salt
samples taken during this period, however, imply that a

significant. amount of ®°*Mo occurred along with other
noble-metal isotopes in pump bowl salt samples as
particulates. Since molybdenum was relatively high in
the present surveillance samples also, it may be that an

appreciable part of deposition involved material from

this pool.

Because molybdenum deposited more strongly than
its precursor niobium, an appreciable part of the
molybdenum found must have deposited independently
of niobium deposition, and niobium behavior may only
roughly indicate molybdenum behavior at- best. This
may well be due to the relation of niobium behavior to
the Redox potential of the salt, while molybdenum
may not be affected in the same way.

Ruthenium. The ruthenium isotopes '°3Ru and
106 Ru appear to be quite similar in behavior and did
not exhibit any marked response to flow or flux
variations. The ruthenium isotopes appear to deposit
several-fold more intensely on metal than on graphite.
The correction of inventories to material formed only
during the current period will increase the °®Ru
intensity ratios about threefold, but will change ‘the
103 Ru intensity ratio very little. On a current inventory
basis the !°3Ru deposition will then be appreciably
lower than that for !°®Ru. This indicates that an
appreciable net time lag may occur before deposition,®
and argues against a dominant direct atomic deposition
mechanism for this element.

Tellurium. The tellurium isotopes 32 Te (on metals)
and !2°™Te (on graphite) show an appreciably stronger
(almost 40X) deposition intensity on metal than on
graphite, indicative of real differences in sticking factor.
Deposition intensities of tellurium were moderately
higher in faster flow than in low-flow regions (2X or
more), possibly indicative of response to mass transfer
effects. Flux effects are not significant.

There is an appreciable discrepancy in the literature
concerning the fraction of !2%Sb decaying to *22™ Te
(as pointed out to us by A. Houtzeel and by J. R.
Tallackson). In calculating inventories we used 36%,
together with 129 chain yields of 2, 0.8, and 2% for
233y, 235Y, and 2?3%Pu, respectively, from the
ORIGEN code library of Bell.” Other values of the
branching fraction have been given elsewhere as 24 and
16%. The relative deposition intensities of !2°™ Te are
inversely proportional to this branching fraction, and

use of lower. branching fraction values would increase

the indicated relative deposition imensity of *22™ Te,

However, the differences between metal and graphite
relative deposition intensities remain quite sharp. _-
Postmortem examination of MSRE components

50

showed !25Sb and !27Te deposition intensities which

were consistent. with this, except that the deposition
intensity of tellurium on the core fuel channel surfaces
was higher than we observe here on surveillance
specimens.

On balance, ‘it appears that the sticking factor of
tellurium on metal is relatively high. This might result

“from direct atomic deposition and/or deposition on

particulate material which then deposits selectively but
securely. Such strong intensity of tellurium in the
deposits could be the result of direct deposition of

tellurium, or similar prompt deposition of precursor

antimony with retention of the tellurium daughter, or
both. The data do not tell.

Iodine. Iodine exhibits deposition intensities respec-

tively averaging about an order of magnitude less than
tellurium both on metal and on graphite; thus the
iodine could have and probably did come from de-
posited tellurium, with a substantial part returning to
salt either by recoil or by dissolution after formation.

Sticking factors. It appears evident that the sticking
factor must be below unity for many of the noble-metal
isotopes, either on metal or graphite, because the
déposition intensity differs for different isotopes under
the same flow conditions. The deposition intensity
appears rather generally to be higher on metals than on
graphite, and could approach unity. In terms of
mechanism, low values of sticking factor could result if
only part of the area was active, or if material was

returned to the liquid, either as atoms via chemical
equilibrium process, or by pickup of deposited particu- -

late material from the surface.

6.2 EFFECTS OF SELECTED FISSION PRODUCTS
ON HASTELLOY N, NICKEL, AND TYPE 304L
STAINLESS STEEL AT 650°C

J.H. Shaffer W.P.Teichert W.R. Grimes

Samples of Hastelloy N from various sections of the
fuel system revealed widespread, superficial grain
boundary cracking of the alloy.® The absence of grain
boundary cracks on surfaces exposed to the coolant salt
mixture or to the cell atmosphere, together with
supporting analytical data on surface layer materials,
indicated that certain fission product elements may
have contributed to the corrosion process. As part of a
larger effort within the MSRP to investigate this
phenomenon, a joint effort of the Reactor Chemistry
Division and the Metals and Ceramics Division was
launched to identify those fission products which are
capable of producing grain boundary cracks in Hastel-
loy N and to develop methods for evaluating remedial
measures, both chemical and metallurgical, which might

be prompted by this investigation.

Fission products of general interest in this study are
comprised of those elements whose fluorides are. ther-

modynamically unstable in the molten-salt fuel environ- -

ment. Of this group, those elements which have
relatively low boiling points and which form low-
melting alloys with metal components of the structural
material are being investigated first. Preliminary experi-
ments based on these criteria have been designed to
expose metallurgical tensile specimens to various ele-

mental solute vapors within quartz ampuls at elevated -

temperatures. Tests with tellurium, selenium, sulfur,
iodine, cadmium, arsenic, and antimony on tensile
specimens of Hastelloy N, nickel, and type 304L

stainless steel have been conducted or are in progress.

known, the fraction of a given isotope to be found on

given reactor surfaces could be obtained by integration
over the area under consideration, and dividing by total
reactor area. Tables 6.1 and 6.2 give the relative
deposition intensities under some conditions along the
core axis. However, in order to extend these to other
reactor areas of interest in the absence of further
observation or experiment, appropriate relationships to
the conditions in those areas are needed. The usual
method is mass transfer analysis, but to establish the

driving force coupled with such analysis, an adequate

statement of all significant paths and mechanisms must
be established. The present data are sufficient for only
part of this, and their extension will not be attempted
here. ’ :

Experiments will follow in which metallographic tensile
specimens will be contacted with molten salt during
exposure to these elements.

The first experiment consisted of five quartz ampuls,
each containing four Hastelloy N tensile specimens that
were secured to a Hastelloy N wire rack. Sufficient

solute was added to the ampuls during their preparation

to yield a concentration of 100 ppm by weight in a
5-mil layer on the metal surfaces after vapor deposition.
(Samples of Hastelloy N from the MSRE had tellurium
concentrations of this magnitude.) The effects of

- tellurium, selenium, sulfur, and iodine were examined

separately in four of the test ampuls. Arsenic, anti-
mony, and cadmium were combined in the remaining

quartz ampul. The five ampuls, sealed by fusion after:

51

residual gases were evacuated, were heated at controlled -

rates to 650°C and maintained at that temperature for
"1000 hr. Metallographic examinations were performed
on one specimen from each group at the conclusion of
this test period. The stressed specimen exposed to
tellurium was visibly corroded, that exposed to iodine
showed only marginal corrosion, and the specimens
exposed to selenium, to sulfur, and to arsenic plus
antimony plus cadmium were not detectably attacked.

The second experiment provided an additional

. 1000-hr exposure at 650°C, with the remaining test
specimens arranged to examine effects with and with-
out additional solute. A new set of specimens was also
exposed to tellurium in a duplicate of the first test.
Results were consistent with those of the first test, but
no significant effects from additional solute or the
increased exposure period were evident.

The third experiment, conducted in the same manner,
examined the effects of tellurium, iodine, and mixtures
of these two elements on tensile specimens of pure
nickel and type 304L stainless steel, and of tellurium
alone on Hastelloy N. Solute concentrations of 100
ppm by weight per element and a test period of 1000 hr
at 650°C were again used. The results of metallurgical
examinations at the conclusion of the experiment
showed that only those specimens exposed to teflurium
alone were attacked. Of these specimens, Hastelloy N
was comparable to those of previous tests, nickel
showed less attack than Hastelloy N, and the type 304L
stainless steel showed no apparent corrosion.

The most salient result of these experiments is that
effects on Hastelloy N not unlike that found in the
MSRE fuel system have been produced with relatively
low concentrations of tellurium during relatively short
time periods at a temperature comparable to that
experienced by the MSRE. A detailed description of the
metallurgical examinations and discussions of results
appear in Part 3 of this report.

Additional experiments are in progress to further
examine the effects of these solute elements on
Hastelloy N, nickel, and type 304L stainless steel. One
set of experiments will examine the effects of tellurium
at concentrations of 300, 5000, and 10,000 ppm by
weight on tensile specimens of these three materials at
550, 650, and 700°C during a 1000-hr exposure period.

6.3 REACTION OF CoF; WITH TELLURIUM
J.D.Redman G.F.Weaver

The studies described in the preceding section and in
Part 3 indicate that tellurium may play an important
part in the surface cracking of Hastelloy N. Conse
quently, the reactions, stability, and volatility of
tellurium fluorides and of the structural metal tellurides

‘are being investigated. This work was initiated with a

mass spectrometric study of the reaction of cobalt .
trifluoride with tellurium metal in a nickel cell, since
this reaction might afford a convenient means of adding
tellurium fluoride vapors to a molten-salt mixture to
assess the thereby induced corrosion of metal speci-
mens.

. The first experiment was made with CoF; and
tellurium contained in a compartmented cell and
unmixed except in the vapor phase. It was found that
observable reaction started at 225°C, evolving TeF at a
pressure of 5 X 107% torr. The pressure of this species
was 3 X 107% and 3 X 107% torr at 250 and 275°C

respectively. At 300°C a mixture of TeFg and TeF,

tellurium, selenium, sulfur, iodine, cadmium, arsenic,

400°C. Tellurium vapor was observed at 400°C, cobalt
trifluoride at 600°C, and nickel fluoride at 700°C. In
addition, a deposit of grayish-white material formed on
the lid of the effusion cell. This has not yet been
identified but is likely to be a lower fluoride of
tellurium.® A pink residue of CoF, identified by x-ray
diffraction’ ® remained in the cell.

A second experiment duplicated the first except that
the solid CoF; and tellurium were mixed. This mixture,
which did not react at ambient temperature, started to
evolve volatile tellurium fluorides at slightly less than

52

200°C. The reaction was much more rapid than in the
first experiment and continued even when the tempera-
ture of the cell was lowered to 100°C. Only TeFs was
observed at 100°C; TeF4 and F, were evolved at 150°C
in addition to TeF,; tellurium metal was observed at
200°C. The occurrence of these species at lower
temperatures than in the first experiment suggests that
the sample of mixed solids may have been heated above
the cell temperature by exothermic reactions. These
results indicate that CoF; and tellurium will provide a
convenient source of tellurium fluorides, but that the
reactants should be mixed in the gas phase, since the
reaction of mixtures of the solids, even in small
amounts, will be difficult to control.

7. Behavior of Hydrogen and Its Isotopes

7.1 SOLUBILITY OF HYDROGEN
IN MOLTEN SALT

D. M. Richardson A. P. Malinauskas

The ease with which tritium, either as T, or TH, can
be removed (or lost) from the molten-salt loops
depends to some extent on the solubility of the gas in
the corresponding molten-salt solvents. As no data
existed in this regard, and an adequate theoretical
treatment, with which reliable estimates could be made,
was lacking, an experimental program was developed.

Measurements of the solubilities of helium and
hydrogen in Li, BeF, at 600°C were completed during

this period. The experiments, which were performed at :

saturation pressures between 1 and 2 atm, were
conducted using the two-chamber apparatus described
previously.

Although little difficulty was encountered with the
helium measurements, the results initially obtained with
hydrogen displayed a disturbing degree of scatter.!
Under the assumption that the cause of the scatter was
due to air inleakage over prolonged periods of time, we
prefaced each hydrogen experiment with a lengthy
hydrogen sparge at 700°C. This pretreatment resulted
in reproducible measurements and yielded values signifi-
cantly lower than those obtained previously. As a
result, all of the earlier data were discarded.

The experimental data obtained at 600°C are sum-
marized graphically in Fig. 7.1, where the solubilities of
the two gases in Li, BeF4 are plotted as a function of
saturation pressure. The solid lines represent the corre-
sponding Henry’s law constants for ‘the two. solute-
solvent systems at the temperature indicated; the

“constants derived from the data displayed in the figure
- are (8.40 £ 0.16) X 107% mole of gas per atm per cm?

of salt for helium, and (4.34 + 0.20) X 10~® mole of

gas per atm per cm? of salt for hydrogen.

The value quoted above for helium is about 40%
lower than that reported by Watson et al.2 Although

this discrepancy is outside the limits of mutual uncer-
tainty, and we are unable to account for the discord-

7.2 INITIAL TRITIUM CHEMISTRY IN THE CORE
‘OF A MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR

R. A. Strehlow

In the analysis of tritium behavior it is necessary to
consider what happens when a high-velocity triton is
born in a fuel of oxidation potential fixed by the ratio
U3*/U*. Half of the tritium in the reference-design

_MSBR is produced by

SLi*+n->T*+%He+ 4.8 MeV,

which gives a triton with an initial energy of 2.7 MeV.3

The triton will lose energy at a rate which may be

approximated as one-third that of protons for collision
with light elements. This gives an initial value of about
30 MeV g~! cm™2, increasing to 200 MeV g™! cm™? at
an energy of 0.05 MeV.* Integration of this stopping
power yields a calculated path length of about 0.05
g/cm? or 0.025 cm in salt having a density of 2 g/cm3.

- This is about a tenth of the minimum dimension of fuel

passages in an MSBR, so only a few percent of the
initially formed tritium would be expected to reach the
graphite before thermalization. Tritons from the
"Li(n,an) reaction are born with generally less energy
and would be thermalized in a shorter path length. Thus
nearly all the tritium will appear in the salt initially : as
thermalized tritons.

Some equations for pertinent equilibria involving the
thermalized triton are:

The fluorine atom reactions have been considered by

Jenks.’ The principal source of fluorine atoms which he
considered is indicated as Eq. (9) — the formation of
fluorine by the fission recoil atoms during their
thermalization. He concluded that it is possible that in
the bulk of the melt, U* ions serve as scavengers for
the radiolytic products F° and e” [in accordance with
Eq. (10) and {13)]. From Jenks’ calculation a possible
steady-state concentration of F° is calculated to equal

‘about 1.5 X 10'!/cm3, assuming a fission rate of 3 X

10'! sec”! em™3 (about 10 W/em®) and a uranium(IV)
concentration of 5 X 10'®/cm3. The production of F°
associated with tritium production (about 10'° sec™
cm™2) would not contribute significantly to the con-
centration following from the fission recoil process.

Because of this low expected concentration of fluo-
rine atoms and the dominance of U*, tritium atoms
should be expected to enter into equilibrium with U**
in accordance with reaction (3). This has been the
assumption made previously in consideration of tritium
core chemistry.® Detailed consideration of reaction
rates will be needed to determine the extent to which
these conclusions are valid.

7.3 PERMEATION OF HYDROGEN THROUGH
METALS AT LOW PRESSURES
R. A. Strehlow H.C. Savage

Knowledge of the permeation behavior of hydrogen
through iron and nickel-based alloys at low pressures is
required for the prediction of tritium behavior in the

" molten-salt reactor.

Tritium release to the environment froni a molten-salt
breeder would occur because the isotopes of hydrogen
flow readily through hot metals. The tritium is ex-
pected to follow the flow of heat through the reactor’s

‘heat exchangers into the steam system and thence to

the outside world.

At high pressures the permeation rate is proportional
to the square root of the pressure, because the
hydrogen molecules dissociate into atoms when they
enter the metal. A transition to a linear dependence has

generally been reported to occur as the pressure is
lowered. The point at which this transition occurs, if at
all, is important, since a linear dependence might
predict an acceptable tritium. flow at some particular
pressure, while the square-root relationship would give
an intolerably large discharge at the same pressure.
Many workers in the field have stressed the fact that
the hydrogen flow rate through materials such as
Hastelloy N,” iron,® and palladium® varies with the
‘square root of pressure at higher pressures, but begins
to deviate from the square-root dependence below some
low pressure. The departure has been reported in the
cited work to be significant at pressures as high as 200
torr,” although departures beginning at values near 10
torr are more commonly reported. Such departures

“have been attributed to a reduction in apparent area

due to a restricted surface coverage by sorbed hydrogen
atoms or by the formation of a film of lower
permeability. : :

Since extrapolation of permeation data to the lower
pressures required in-a molten-salt reactor is essential in
calculations of tritium management schemes, an experi-
mental program was undertaken to measure the pres-
sure dependence of hydrogen permeation through
candidate structural materials from pressures of 30 torr
down to about 1073 torr.

The apparatus is schematically shown in: Fig. 7.2.
Deuterium, rather than hydrogen, was chosen for this
study .to avoid problems posed by the large (107° torr)

" hydrogen background in the mass: spectrometer. A

mixture of argon—4% deuterium is maintained at a total
pressure from 1 atm down to 107! torr; regulation of
the pressure of this mixture produces the steady-state
deuterium pressure of interest and allows accurate
pressure measurements to be made readily.

In order to measure the pressure of the permeated
deuterium accurately and to maintain a low pressure of
deuterium inside the permeation tube, an argon purge is
used. Use of an absolute gage to measure the total
pressure and a mass spectrometer to measure deuterium
concentration of the purge allows accurate determina-
tion of the back pressure and correction for back
diffusion of deuterium. Flow rate of the argon purge is
used in combination with the measured composition to
determine the permeation rate of deuterium. Permeated

deuterium pressures in the range of 107 torr can be
determined readily with this procedure. Only steady-
state permeation has been attempted in this work.
Consequently, no separate determination of the diffu-

sivity has been made.

Values of the permeation constant obtained for
Hastelloy N fall within a factor of 2 of those of Webb.”
In contrast with the earlier data, however, the pressure
dependence of the permeation flow rate was found to
follow a square-root relation quite precisely over the
entire pressure range studied. This is shown in Fig. 7.3,
where the data are presented in the form of an
arithmetic plot of hydrogen flow rates vs VP; — v/P3,
where P, is the permeation gas partial pressure, and P,
is the “back” or “downstream” pressure which must be
used as a correction.

Arbitrary permeation flow rate figures, without con-
cern here for sample areas or thicknesses, are used to
permit comparison with the earlier work on Hastelloy
N. The only explanation offered here for the marked
difference between the data obtained in this study and
the earlier work! ? is that, previously, pressure rise rates
have been generally used at the lowest pressures
studied. Since we have observed that steady state may
require tens of hours to achieve at low pressures and
that permeation flow rates themselves may be in the
range of 7 X 10™* cc(STP) hr? 2, a steady-state
method such as the one used here is perhaps better.

The conclusion from these experiments is that for
Hastelloy N, a square-root pressure dependence is
recommended for extrapolation to low pressures.

10. Only Webb's (ref. 7) low-pressure results are discussed
here. His steady-state method for permeability determination,
which he conducted at higher pressures than for the work
reported here, is not at all in question. Webb’s higher-pressure
measurements are in very good agreement with those we have
determined. :

7.4 INFLUENCE OF FILMS OR COATINGS
ON HYDROGEN PERMEATION RATES

R. A. Strehlow H.C. Savage

Calculations based on the results of the work reported

.in the preceding section show that bare metal probably

does not provide adequate impedance to tritium flow at
low pressures. Consequently, to determine whether
options might exist to obtain the low flow rates
required in a reactor becomes the question. The use of

oxide coatings to impede flow has been proposed,’
since the permeation rate through oxides should. be
proportional to the first power of pressure. (It is known -
that hydrogen does not dissociate upon dissolving in

- ceramics.) An oxide such as forms on stainless steel in
"an oxidizing atmosphere (Ps,0/Pu, > 1075 for Cr, 0

at 700°C) might offer, therefore, a useful resistance to
permeation flow.

Initial experiments were carried out t with the Hastel-
loy N- tube which had been used in the low-pressure
study. An argon—20% oxygen mixture was used to
oxidize the external surface of the tube in situ at 690°C

_ before determining the permeation behavior. Although

a reduction in permeability was observed - initially
(about a factor of 2), at steady state the permeability
had recovered to its value for the unoxidized tube. An
experiment designed to deposit a carbon coating by
thermal decomposition of methane yielded the same
results. However, many hours were required to reach
steady-state conditions for the permeation of the
hydrogen. It should be noted that equilibrium oxida-
tion conditions for nickel are associated with
Py, 0/Pu, ratios greater than about 50 at 700°C. Even
at the lowest pressures used in this study, we believe the
conditions used in these experiments were still reducing
rather than oxidizing.

Type .304L stainless steel was selected as representa-
tive of a class of metals which might behave differently
from the Hastelloy N. A permeation tube specimen,
cleaned by etching, was installed in the apparatus.
Measurements at pressures from 30 to 1072 torr at first
showed a permeability nearly equal to that of Hastelloy
N, with a square-root dependence over the entire range.

Subsequently, over a period of some tens of hours,
the permeability was observed to decrease by a factor
of about 8. This was presumed due to the formation of
the oxide by trace amounts of oxidant in the gas system
used in this work.

Surprisingly, the pressure dependence of permeation
rate still followed the square-root relation! A reasonable
expectation had been that some departure from this
should have been observed for any significant reduction
or permeability. The logic for this expectation is fairly
well seen in Fig. 7.4, which shows the logarithm

" (permeation flow rate) for various materials and thick-

nesses as a function of logarithmic pressure of tritium.
Zero downstream pressure is assumed here for illustra-
tive purposes. The restriction of loss of tritium from the
system must be accomplished by reducing the tritium
pressure to values below the intercept of the permea-
tion flow rate with the range indicated, which here
corresponds to a loss of 1 to 30 Ci/day for an 8 X-107
cm? heat exchanger.

J For simplicity in operating the tritium removal
processes in a reactor, the maximum permissible pres-
sure of tritium determined in this way should be as
large as possible. (That is, purge gas volumes needed
would then be minimized, and process rates for
chemical removal and chemical trapping would then
require the minimum mass handling.)

Line 1 in Fig. 7.4 shows the permeability of Hastelloy
or freshly etched stainless steel which intercepts the
vacuum impact rate, line'2, at a very low pressure but
still in the calculated range of interest. As an oxide
surrogate the data for quartz were used,!' and a
thickness of 200 A was selected for display as line 3. To
account for the diminution of permeation flow rate by
the factor observed using this model of two impedances
in series with their different pressure dependences, a
very nearly first-power dependence should have been
evident. The observation of a half-power dependence
leads to the conclusion that a film with only partial

effectiveness in covering the metal had been obtained.

The temperature was raised to 785°C from 700°C in
order to permit the development of a thicker coating.
The range of measurement was also. extended to
atmospheric pressure. For the stainless steel sample,
after some hundreds of hours at temperature, a depar-

.ture from half power has been obtained with the data
varying in a regular and reproducible way from about
-the two-thirds power at higher pressures to the three-

These are labeled as lines 5 and 6 respectively.

The relative efficacies of these low-permeability coat-
ings in considering the tritium management question
must be viewed, however, in terms of the effect of
added protium, since it. probably cannot be avoided.
The flow impedence offered by metal relative to that
offered by oxide is decreased with addition of hydrogen
to the system. Combined credit for the coating and for
use of this mass action. effect cannot be taken except
for metal coatings. As a consequence, as shown in
Fig. 7.5, the 0.006-in. tungsten coating becomes as
good as or better than a ceramic one at pressures near 1
torr of 'H, in terms of the maximum tolerable tritium
partial pressure. Within the assumptions made here, the
possibly achievable factor of 10° decrease in tritium
permeation rates for the thin ceramic coating and the
larger factor for the thick coating simply specify the
tolerable partial pressures of tritium both in the absence
and presence of protium.

The questions about coating use thus become those
associated with ways to overcome the unavoidable

differential thermal expansion problem and to achieve
minimum porosity in the coating.

the first sample (29.6 g) was loaded, in a dry box, along
with Hastelloy N coupons into a nickel capsule. The
capsule was subsequently evacuated and sealed off by
welding a crimped section of an attached tube. The
capsule was next placed in the quartz enclosure of the
gas handling apparatus, in which it was heated to
535°C. In the apparatus the gas pressure, exerted

* predominantly by hydrogen diffusing out of the cap-

sule, was measured with a McLeod gage; samples of gas
were intermittently collected and analyzed for hydro-
gen by gas chromatograph.

The sample was maintained at 535°C for 61 days; i in
this period the equivalent of 23 ppm hydrogen escaped
as gas from the nickel capsule. The experiment was

terminated when the permeation rate out of the capsule
had decreased to less than 0.025 std cm® per day. Such.

small quantities of hydrogen are difficult to analyze
accurately by gas chromatograph.

Thus one can obtain Q by measuring equilibrium
pressures of hydrogen corresponding to OH" concentra-
tions calculated by mass balance from the original
26-ppm hydrogen concentration.

During the experiment, hydrogen pressures were
measured after allowing at least three days for the
hydrogen passing out of the capsule to equilibrate with

"the hydrogen within the capsule. The data and calcu- .

lated Q are given in Table 7.1.
Postexperimental analysis of the salt for hydrogen
showed 23 ppm, substantially greater than the expected

3 ppm based upon the original analysis (26 ppm) minus

the amount removed in the experiment (23 ppm). At
present this discrepancy is difficult to understand.
Using the postexperimental analysis for calculating the
equilibrium quotient of reaction (1), we obtain Q ~
0.72, a factor of § less than that based on the original
hydrogen analysis (see Table 7.1).

Another nickel capsule, containing the second sample
from loop 14, has been installed in our apparatus; an

‘experiment similar to the one detailed above is in
. progress. The infrared analysis of this particular sample,

prior to encapsulation, showed 45 ppm hydrogen.

concentration. (c) The relatively high concentration of
hydroxide in the salt in loop 14 is almost certainly a
reflection of the low permeation of hydrogen through
the metal walls. Since this loop has been operating for a
few years, it is likely that there is a fairly thick,
coherent oxide coating on the outer surfaces. Hope-
fully, high-pressure steam will deposit a similar coating
on the tube walls of the steam-raising system in an
MSBR.

7.6 APPARATUS FOR INFRARED SPECTRAL
STUDIES OF MOLTEN SALTS

J.P. Young J.B.Bates G.E.Boyd

Spectral studies of molten NaF-NaBF, that had been
contacted with D3BO; exhibited an absorption band
attributable to BF;0D~ (ref. 13); these studies were
carried out in SiO, cells. Since then, a small furnace
assembly and an LaF;-windowed nickel cell have been
designed and fabricated so that melts compatible with
these materials of construction can be studied by
infrared spectral techniques. The apparatus can be used
for several fluoride melts of interest to the MSR
project, but the first studies have been of melts of
BF;0H™ and/or BF;0D" in molten NaF-NaBF,. The
furnace and cell are shown in Fig. 7.6.

The furnace was fabricated by LaMont Scientific
© Company (State College, Pennsylvania), from a con-

ceptual design that we developed. The furnace is small
enough to fit in the sample space of a Perkin-Elmer
“ spectrophotometer or a Digilab FTS-20 spectrometer,
or even within a Perkin-Elmer 4X beam condenser. It is
anticipated that this apparatus can also be used in the
emission attachment for the FTS spectrometer. The
heated portion of the furnace consists of a boron
nitride (BN) tube, ¥ in. ID, wound with resistance
heating wire. Boron nitride wool insulation surrounds

the tube, and the assembly is enclosed in a metal can

that is open at the ends, which are aligned with the BN
tube ends. These ends are water cooled, equipped with
Viton O-rings, and will accept infrared transmitting
windows. At present we are using AgCl or AgBr
windows, The furnace with windows in place is vacuum
tight and can be operated under vacuum, or with an
atmosphere of inert gas. A control box associated with
the furnace is capable of regulating a preset temperature
to less than 1°C. There is also a design arrangement so
that a gas bubbler (or diffusion) tube can be inserted

- into the furnace and infrared cell so that melts in the

cell can react with gases of interest.

The cell, shown assembled in Fig. 7.6, consists of a
nickel body designed to accept two LaF; windows. The
windows are held in place by nickel retainers, and the
retainers are pressed against the windows by the small
screws seen at the windowed ends of the cell. The
apparatus is designed so that the windows can be used
without a gasket as in the diamond-windowed cells.! 4
In some of our early experiments it seemed that molten

'NaF-NaBF, leaked around the windows. Accordingly,

gold gaskets (0.005 in. thick) are now being used
between the window and the cell body.
The operation of -the cell and furnace has been
satisfactory; however, some cell windows have cracked,
probably. as a result of samples having been cycled
through the freezing point a number of times. (Thermal -
expansion on melting of a previously frozen sample
could put a severe strain on crystalline windows.) The

‘thermal characteristics of the furnace have been quite

satisfactory; a regulated temperature of 450°C can be
obtained rapidly (i.e, in less than 15 min) after a
sample has been loaded. To load the cell into the
furnace, one of the furnace windows is removed; the
cell containing the sample is placed in the center of the
furnace tube, and the window is resealed so that the

" atmosphere in the furnace can be flushed with argon.

band at about 3600 cm™, which may be due to a
species such as B;FsO3O0H*". The spectrum of Fig.
7.7B was measured from the same melt after bubbling
D, gas through it for about 5 min.. The band at 2690
em™ was previously observed in an NaF-NaBF, melt
which had been spiked with D3 BO;. This band is due
to the OD stretching mode of BF;0D™. Because the

nickel had not been previously hydrogen fired, the

61

BF30D~ could have been produced either by isotopic
exchange with BF;0H™ or by a reaction which depends

on the reduction of Ni** jons by D, :
Ni**+D, >Ni® +2D*. Co ©)

Following these measurements, the nickel cell and
deuterium bubbler were cleaned and hydrogen fired.
The initial experiment was then repeated, but the band
at 2690 cm™ was not observed after bubbling D,
through the melt for time periods of up to 30 min.
Considerable difficulty was encountered at this point
with loss of sample through the top of the cell because
of a vapor lock with the D, gas.

The infrared spectra of NaF-NaBF, melts contained
in silica cells are presented in Fig. 7.8. The salt sample
was the same as before (25 ppm H). Figure 7.84 shows
the melt spectrum prior to D, treatment. The band at
about 3670 cm™ is due to the hydroxyl impurities in

‘the silica cell. After bubbling D, through the molten

salt for 10 min, the band at 2690 cm™ appeared as

shown. Additional D, treatment was continued for 30

min, but no change in absorbancy of the 2690 cm™
band was detected. To determine if reduction by D, of
a metal ion is the primary step in the production of
BF;0D", a crystal of FeF, was added to the melt, and
the treatment with D, was resumed. The infrared
spectrum measured after about 10 min of bubbling is
shown in Fig. 7.88. Rather than an increase in the
intensity of the 2690 cm™! band, an additional band at
about 2750 cm! was observed. The above experiment
was repeated with the addition of NiO to the melt in
place of FeF,. The spectrum after D, treatment (Fig.
7.8C) exhibited bands at 2835 and 2750 cm™ in
addition to the one at 2690 cm™! ,

Some tentative conclusions may be drawn on the
basis of the experimental results described above: (1)
Direct isotopic exchange of BF; OH™ with D, did not
occur to a measurable extent. (2) The reaction respon-
sible for the production of BF;0D™ on bubbling D,
into molten NaF-NaBF, involved reducing some chemi-
cal species present in the melt with D, :

A™ 4D, > AD 4 opt ®

fusion of D, through a metal tube immersed in molten

C18 THERMAL STABILITY OF NaNO;,
KNO;, NaNO, , AND HITEC

J.D.Redman C.F. Weaver

A mass spectrometric study of the thermal stability of
NaNO;, KNO;, NaNO, , and HITEC was made as part
of an evaluation of their potential use as coolants in
molten-salt reactors. In such salt mixtures as HITEC,
NaNOQ,-NaNQ;-KNO; (40-7-53 wt %), the reaction

H, + 2KNO; = 2KNO, + H,0,

which has a large negative standard free energy, may
afford the means to convert elemental tritium to
tritiated water, and thus provide a means to control its
distribution. Since nitrates and nitrites are known to
decompose ‘thermally, it was useful to determine what
additional vapor species were formed.

Reagent-grade NaNOj;, KNO;, and NaNO, were
dehydrated by bubbling helium gas (which had been
dried by passage through activated charcoal at liquid-
nitrogen temperature) through the molten salt. These

dehydrations were continued for about 16 hr at -

temperatures of 345, 320, and 285°C for KNOj,

NaNOj;, and NaNQ, respectively. The NaNO, cooled to

a hard, yellow glass. The other two salts were relatively

- soft and nearly white. Handling and storage of the

dehydrated materials were done in a dry-box atmo-

sphere. Subsequent mass spectrometric studies showed
the purification technique to be successful with respect

to H, 0 removal.

Small samples of each of the salts were monitored
during evaporation from a nickel Knudsen cell. Vapor
species of each salt began to appear S to 10°C above the

preparation temperature. Decomposition pressures
limited the upper temperature to approximately 125°C
above the preparation temperatures and about 100°C
below the temperature of MSR interest.

All three salts evolved NO. In addition, the nitrates
produced O, and the nitrite produced N,. Appearance
potentials and relative intensities of the fragments
confirmed the identity of these molecules. These
permanent gases do not allow accurate pressure meas-
urements because of background interference, but the
total pressures were certainly in the range of 0.1 to 1

torr at the upper temperature limit (450°C). In addition
to the NO, O,, and N,, Na and K were carried into the

gas phase by some unidentified species. The appearance
potentials of the Na* and K* ions make it clear that the
Na and K were not present as the metal vapors. Both
NaNO; and NaNO,- attacked the nickel cell and
produced NiO.

These results are in agreement with the conclusion of
Kust and Burke!® that nitrate melts decompose at
lower temperatures than previously suggested,!”-!®
though Kust and Burke did not determine the composi-

- tion of the evolved gases. The earlier higher temperature

studies! 7° (600 to 780°C) produced mixtures of O,,
N,, and NO,, while at the lower temperatures (up to
450°C) of these experiments we saw NO and N, or NO
and O, for nitrite and nitrate respectively.

A batch of HITEC was prepared from the previously
purified components. Dry helium gas was bubbled
through the molten mixture, contained in a glass flask,
overnight at 180°C. The cooled, nearly white, very hard
material was ground, handled, and stored in a dry box.
A sample of the ground and well-mixed material was
evaporated in a nickel Knudsen cell over the tempera-
ture range 200 to 600°C. Decomposition products
appeared near 275°C. The gases NO, O,, N;, and’
possibly N, O were observed over this mixture as well as
unidentified species carrying Na and K in a nonmetallic
form. Total pressures were about an order of magnitude
lower for the ternary. mixture when compared with the
components at the same. temperatures. Interestingly,
NiO was not detected in the residue from this experi-
ment. . )

Studies of these materials at higher temperatures will
require a different approach, such as transpiration and
off-gas analysis, since the pressures will be above the
range acceptable with the mass spectrometer.

8. Fluoroborate Chemistry

8.1 SOLUBILITY OF BF; IN FLUORIDE MELTS
S. Cantor -R.M. Waller

The solubility measurements of BF; in fluoride melts
serve to determine the activity of fluoride ion in molten

‘mixtures of LiF-BeF,, LiF-BeF,-ThF,, and LiF-ThF,.
- Since the scope of this program involves measurements

in a relatively large number of melts, we have changed
our method of measurement from the sparge-and-strip
technique! - to a new method which generates data
faster and, probably, with greater accuracy.

In the present method, BF, pressures are measured in
a cylindrical nickel vessel containing a weighed sample

of salt and a known vapor volume. Once the vapor

space in the vessel is determined, the inert, virtually
insoluble calibrating gas (argon) is evacuated; a- meas-
ured amount of BF; is then introduced into the
evacuated vessel. The fraction of BF; that does not
dissolve in the sample is calculated from the pressure,
volume, and temperature profile of the vapor space.
Salt charges are usually sufficiently large to dissolve at
least 80% of the BF; introduced into the vessel.
Pressures are read off a strip-chart recorder which tracks
the output from a stainless steel strain-gage transducer
connected to a riser on the vessel. The vessel is
positioned in a furnace mounted on a motor-driven
rocker. Co

"As a test of the reliability of the new method, BF,

Further, the newer results are consistent with previous
data? obtained in compositions with greater LiF con-
centrations. .

Solubilities of BF; were also measured in MSBR fuel
solvent (72-16-12 mole % LiF-BeF,-ThF,). The data
are summarized in Table 8.2. When we apply the
isotherms of Fig. 8.1 to the Henry’s law constants in
this solvent, the calculated activities of LiF are 0.21,

. 0.225, and 0.255 at 500, 600, and 700°C respectively.

The LiF activities in MSBR fuel solvent are about
one-half those in 72-28 mole % LiF-BeF,.? This trend

is consistent with other observations (e.g., LiF liquidus

solubilities were measured in LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) -

in the temperature range 498 to 839°C. The solubility
of BF; per unit pressure, that is, Henry’s law constant,
agreed closely with that obtained in the sparge-and-strip
method (see Table 8.1). Solubilities of BF; in two
other LiF-BeF; melts were also measured. These data
and some derived enthalpies of solution are listed in
Table 8.2. Co
Previously, we have reported? that Henry’s law
constants for BF; solubility varied linearly with the

thermodynamic activities? of LiF in the system LiF--

BeF,. As Fig. 8.1 shows, the newer data obtained in
three LiF-BeF, mixtures exhibit this linear behavior.

at this temperature and the BF, equilibrium pressure,
the reactivity loss would be 15.5%; this number is about
eight times greater than a 2% reactivity loss which
assures subcriticality. Thus fairly low pressures of BF;
in equilibrium with MSBR fuel salt are sufficient for

positive shutdown of the reactor. To obtain some idea
about the rate of BF; dissolution in fuel salt, we
permitted BF; to flow into the vapor space of an
evacuated vessel containing 2 kg of MSBR fuel solvent
at 585°C. Except for possible convection currents, the
salt remained quiescent during the gas inflow. Under a
BF; pressure of 28 psig, the initial rate of dissolution
was 0.63 X 107 mole of BF; per minute per cubic
centimeter of salt. This rate of dissolution corresponds
to a B/U atom ratio of 0.004 per minute, and if this
rate prevailed in a reactor, subcriticality would have
occurred in 10 min. However, this time interval refers
to a stagnant salt melt and a relatively low driving force
of 28 psig of BF3. Very simple improvement in BF;
injection, together with circulation of the salt, would
have greatly shortened the time to subcriticality. These
considerations suggest that BF; gas at moderate pres-

-sures can be effective in a backup scram system in the

MSBR. The BF; could be subsequently removed from
the salt by first sparging with helium, followed by

“neutronically “burning” any boron residue in the salt.

The measurements of BF; solubility in MSBR fuel
solvent are also useful in estimating certain effects of
mixing fluoroborate coolant and MSBR fuel salt. If
fluoroborate coolant were to leak into the MSBR fuel
circuit, the NaBF, in the coolant would decompose to
NaF and BF;; the former would!dissolve in the salt,
while ‘the latter would distribute between the salt and
the vapor space. The equilibrium distribution can be
calculated from the following equations:

where n; is the total number of moles. of BF; leaking
in from the coolant; n, and ng are the number of moles
of BF; in the vapor space and in the salt respectively; R
is the gas constant; ¥,, is the molar volume of the salt
in the fuel circuit; T is the temperature in degrees
Kelvin; Vg and V, are the volumes of salt and vapor
space in the fuel circuit (to a good approximation,
V/V, is the void fraction in the salt); and Ky; is
-Henry’s law constant in moles of BF3 per mole of salt
per atmosphere of BF;, almost the same as the units of
K,; in Table 8.2. Equation (2) is readily derived from
the ideal gas law in conjunction with simple dimen-
sional considerations.

A simple application of the above equations involves
the case of a low inleakage such that Ky; is not very
different from the Ky; of the fuel itself. Assume T =
950°K (1250°F) and a void fraction of 0.01; also R =

The double salts NaNiF; and NaFeF; have been
shown to be stable, relatively insoluble compounds in
molten NaF-NaBF, mixtures. A knowledge of their
formation free energies would permit an estimate of the
equilibrium position of such corrosion reactions as

2HF(g) + Ni (Hastelloy N)
oo + NaF(d)= NaNiF3(0) + Hag), (1)
2HE(g) + Fe (Hastelloy N)
+ NaF(d) = NaFeF5(c) + Hy (8) . (2)

ber 1971). Co

The former reaction should correspond to the most
oxidizing condition which Hastelloy N can tolerate.

The present work describes the experimental determi-
nation of AGS of NaNiF; and of NaFeF; based on
measurements of the equilibria

NaNiF;(c) = NaF(d) + NiF;(c), K3g =ay,p >» (30)

NaFeF3(c) = NaF(d) + FeF,(c), Kap =an,p, (3D)

where ay, is the activity of NaF, and (c) and (d)
represent, respectively, the: crystalline. and dissolved
state. The experimental procedure consisted in equilib-
rating at various temperatures the solids NiF, and
NaNiF; or FeF, and NaFeF; with molten NaBF,
while accurately measuring the BF; pressures. Since the
solids are not very soluble in molten NaBF, + NaF, the
liquid phase may be treated as a simple binary mixture,
and thus the BF; pressures measured can be used to
calculate the NaF content of the melt corresponding to

“equilibria (32) and (3b) above. The NaBF,-NaFeF;-

FeF, mixture was contained in a 1%-in. nickel vessel
fitted with a copper liner; the mixture with niobium
compounds did not have the liner, Each reaction vessel
was equipped with a thermocouple well and connected
directly to a mercury manometer and, through a Hoke
413 valve, to a vacuum pump. All tube connections
were either silver soldered or welded.

Typically (where M is either niobium or iron), 0.3
mole of NaBF,, 0.1 mole of MF,, and 0.06 mole of
NaMF, were loaded into the reaction vessel. The
NaMF; compounds were prepared by heating stoichio-
metric amounts of NaF and MF, with a small amount
of NaBF, at 800°C under argon. X-ray diffraction
analysis of the product indicated it to be more than
95% NaMF;. After loading, the reaction vessel was
sealed and flushed with argon several times. The system
was then evacuated for several hours at room tempera-
ture; no detectable leaks were found. The reaction
vessel was then heated to 500°C and cooled to room
temperature. A residual gas pressure of 50 and 80 mm
Hg remained (with iron and niobium compounds
respectively), due probably to unreacted BF; and traces
of water which had reacted to produce HF. Subse-
quently, the system was evacuated once more to a low
pressure (1 to 10 yu) to remove any residual gas. All the
data presented here (Fig. 8.2) are from measurements
made during the latter runs. At the end of each
equilibration the solids were analyzed by x-ray diffrac-

~ tion, which confirmed the presence of NiF, and

NaNiF; and of FeF, and NaFeF,.

First, the more numerous data from the equilibrium

then assuming that the entropies of reactions (32) and

‘with FeF,-NaFeF; were fitted by least squares, using

the value of a determined for equilibrium (34). The
resulting expressions for the equilibrium constants and

follows: -

Assuming that the activities of nickel and iron in

that the “activity of NaF in the coolant salt is ~0.08
(for the eutectic composition), the ratios of PHF, /PH,
at which nickel and iron will be oxidized, respectively,
to NaNiF; and to NaFeF; are calculated as follows:

- From these estimates it would appear that relatively
large HF partial pressures may be used, if hydrogen is
present, without significant amounts of nickel oxida-
tion in NaF-NaBF, mixtures. Under similar conditions
the iron in Hastelloy N is more susceptible to oxidation
byHF,
The availability of formation free energies and the
low solubilities of NaNiF; and NaFeF; in molten

 
 

NaF-NaBF, mixtures suggest that these compounds
would be promising materials for reference electrodes
to be used in molten NaF-NaBF,.

8.3 PREPARATION OF FUSED SODIUM
FLUOROBORATE FOR THE COOLANT SALT

TECHNOLOGY FACILITY
F. A. Doss W. P. Teichert
Wiley Jennings, Jr. J. H. Shaffer

The preparation of approximately 1550 Ib of the
fused mixture NaBF4-NaF (92-8 mole %), for use in
operating the Coolant Salt Technology Facility (CSTF),
was begun on January 3, 1972, and completed on
March 7, 1972. This production operation was con-
ducted in the Fluoride Production Facility in six batch
operations of about 258 Ib each. Since the CSTF is
currently under construction, its detached drain tank
was positioned within the production facility for direct
loading from the batch processing unit. The loaded
drain tank was then moved to the CSTF for installation.’

Sodium fluoroborate used in this production effort
was part of a 6000-1b lot purchased from the Harshaw
Chemical Company as a custom preparation. Maximum
concentrations of impurities in this material were
specified at levels sufficiently restrictive to facilitate the

- production of the fused mixture. Sodium fluoride,

which was added to make the fused fluoroborate
mixture, was RACS grade and did not significantly
affect the total impurity concentration of the mixture.
With these starting materials the production procedure
was reduced effectively to the removal of water vapor
by evacuation while heating the powdered salts at
controlled rates up to 300°C. Although materials

"specifications allowed 1000 ppm by weight of water in

the starting materials, only negligible quantities were
collected in the cold trap during each run. The salt
mixture was then heated beyond its melting point to
500°C under a static atmosphere of argon and then
sparged at 10 liters/min with BF; for 10 min to ensure
mixing of the two salts. Residual BF; was purged from

the system with argon, and a filtered sample of the salt

was withdrawn for chemical analyses. The salt transfer
line between the drain tank and the production vessel
was connected, and the molten fluoroborate mixture
was displaced into the drain tank by argon pressure. -
This procedure was repeated for each of the six batches
of fluoroborate mixture.

The results of chemical analyses from the six batch

* preparations. are shown in Table 8.3. The averages of

these values should be representative of the total of
materials transferred into the drain tank. Nickel, chrom-
jum, and iron contents of 16, 13, and 141 ppm by
weight, respectively, are well within limits specified for
molten-salt systems. The average oxide content of the
melt was 319 ppm by weight and compares favorably
with a specified limit of 250 ppm in the starting
material. Results of proton analyses on five of the six
batches correspond to 15 ppm by weight. This quan-
tity, if present as the hydroxyl ion, would imply its
association with 240 ppm of the total oxide found. The
average values reported for the major constituents (i..,

“sodium, boron, and fluorine) differ from those calcu-

lated for the mixture by quantities no greater than the
error limits of the analytical determinations. Arbitrary
calculations of the salt composition in mole percent
yield an average value of 95.2% NaBF, and 4.8% NaF.
This implied discrepancy in the salt composition is of
little consequence to the operation of the CSTF, since

the actual salt composition will readily adjust to an
equilibrium with the BF; value of the cover gas stream.

The sodium fluoroborate mixture prepared by this
production effort is considerably better, with respect to
its oxide content, than previous batches produced by

69

generally similar procedures for loop operations. This
improvement is probably the direct result of the “best
effort” provided by the Harshaw Chemical Company in
their preparation of the sodium fluoroborate starting
material.

 
 

9. Protactinium Chemistry

9.1 ‘OXIDE CHEMISTRY OF PROTACTINIUM
IN MSBR FUEL SALT

R.G.Ross ~C.E. Bamberger C.F. Baes, Jr.

Studies of the precipitation of protactinium from
molten LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12 mole %), described in
. several previous progress reports,” have been com-
pleted, and the results are summarized here.

Pa, 05 phase does contain added fluoride, it is probably
LiF, since lithium ion is the most basic cation present.
With UF, in the molten fluoride at concentrations

. typical of an MSBR fuel (~0.3 mole %), the ThO,

Under sufficiently oxidizing conditions (Fig. 9.1), a

very insoluble compound of protactinium(V) is formed
in which, judging from the stoichiometry of the
precipitation, the O/Pa ratio is 2.5. It is thought that
this compound is a fluoride addition compound, prob-
ably of LiF, because: (1) the entropy change deter-
" mined for the following equilibrium is about 23 eu
higher than expected for pure Pa, Os:

PaO, 5 -nLiF(c) + h ThF, )
= PaF(d) + nLiF(d) + %ThO,(c), (1)

log (Xpar  )/(XThF, )
= [4.49 — 8.66 (10/1) £02.

(As usual, the letters g, d, c, and ss will denote,
respectively, components in the gaseous, molten fluo-
ride, crystalline, and solid solution states.) This suggests
that when the Pa,Os phase reacts with the molten
_ fluoride, it releases more species to the solution than
would be the case for pure Pa,0;. (2) Despite several
attempts, we were unable to identify pure Pa,0Oy in
oxides separated from equilibrated mixtures. If the

The equilibrium quotient for this reaction was meas-

ured directly and found to agree well with values

predicted from reaction (1) and the previously deter-
mined quotient for the U*-Th** exchange between
fluoride and oxide phases (see the following sections).
The resulting values indicate that under sufficiently
oxidizing conditions and sufficiently low temperatures
a large fraction -of the protactinium in an MSBR fuel
may be efficiently isolated as a pure phase without
precipitation of the UO, solid solution or any other
phase.

potential (i.e., the U*/U?* ratio) of the fuel and the
very low solubility of the Pa; Os phase. The potential
of the Pa%*/Pa** couple will determine the maximum
U*/U3* ratio in the fuel necessary to prevent inad-
vertent precipitation of protactinium oxide. It will also
determine the minimum U*/U3" ratio in the fuel
necessary to provide the desired insolubility of the

importance of the Pa®*/Pa** couple, it is in need of
more accurate determination. Plans are being made for
such measurements which will employ volumetric

9.2 BINARY SOLID SOLUTIONS OF PaO, AND
OTHER ACTINIDE DIOXIDES AND THEIR
EXCHANGE EQUILIBRIA WITH MOLTEN-SALT

REACTOR FLUORIDES®

C.E.Bamberger R.G.Ross C.F: Baes, Ir.

We have previously reported® on measurements of the
equilibrium quotient of the reaction

ThO, (ss) + PaF4(d) = ThF4(d) + PaO, (ss), (1)

-
Oth = XPa0, XThF4/XThO , XPaF, -

We found that the distribution of Pa** favors the oxide
phase, although not as strongly as U*" in a similar
system.” Additional data have been obtained from a
new experiment where the amount of ThO, added was
significantly increased in order to decrease the ratio

ThO, dissolved/ThO, added. This, in turn, reduced the

uncertainty in the composition of the precipitated
phase when calculated by material balance. Previous
and present data are shown in Table 9.1.

The values obtained for the distribution quotient ora
have Deen correlated with the previous determinations
of oy, (ref. 3) and a value of or derived indirectly
from previous measurements? on the basis of the
following considerations:

1. Hietala® has successfully accounted for the ob-

served heats of mixing of binary alkali halide solid

solutions with a common ion in terms of a simple
model which calculates the displacement of the
common ion in a fixed lattice of the randomly mixed
counter ions. For 1 mole of solution the result is of the
approximate form

dy — d)\? -
AH, ~c( SLY XX, (2)

 

72

where d; and d, are the cation-anion distances for the

two pure salts. For solid solutions with the NaCl
structure, C is a constant. It contains no adjustable

"parameters, being a function only of the molar volumes

and compressibilities of the pure salts.

While an. analogous treatment has not yet been:
completed for substitutional solid solutions with the
fluorite structure, such as those of the actinide diox-
ides, it is clear that the result will be of the same form.
Hence for 1 mole of solution we may write

9.3 TERNARY SOLID SOLUTIONS
OF ThO,, Pa0,, AND UO,

C.F. Baes, Jr.

In the previous section, the exchange of two tetra-
valent actinide cations, M** and N*, between a binary
MQ,-NO, solid solution and a molten fluoride solution
containing MF, and NF, was discussed in terms of the
exchange equilibrium constant

M _Xmo,XNF, MO,

 

N. Xno,XmF, moO,

This constant and the activity coefficients, ymo, and
TNO,» Were (see previous section) represented by
expressions [Egs. (4), (5), and (7)] which involve the
lattice parameters of the oxides, the temperature, and
two empirical constants (4 and B). In an MSBR fuel,
three tetravalent actinide jons — Th**, Pa**, and U* —
will be present under normal conditions. The oxide
phase which could be precipitated inadvertently by
oxide contamination or intentionally for the purpose of
fuel reprocessing will, therefore, be a ternary ThO,-
Pa0,-UO, solid solution. In order to employ the
cquilbrium constants KP? and KY p Cor ky , which is
equal to K 0 /KE 2) to determine. the composition of
this oxide phase as a function of the fuel composition,
it is first necessary to estimate activity coefficients in
such a ternary oxide solid solution. This was done as
follows:

Again it is assumed that such a solid solution has an
ideal entropy of mixing. The problem of estimating
activity coefficients then reduces to estimating the heat
of mixing of the three components, since

RT1 Sad, a)

The heat of mixing of ny +n, + ny moles of the three
oxides can be approximated by imagining that first the

following binary solutions are made:
ny +ys and n, + (n3 =¥3) ,

v3 being a portion of nz, chosen such that these two
solid solutions have equal lattice parameters. Assuming
that the lattice parameter of each solution varies
linearly with mole fraction (Vegard’s law), the value of

y3 which will yield the same lattice parameter for both
solutions | is given by

(a, — ax), +(a;, —az)ns

where the a’s denote the lattice parameters of the pure
oxides.

From Hietala’s model? it is expected that the heats of
mixing for each of these solutions will be, to a good
approximation,

Since the two binary solutions have the same lattice
parameter, their heat of mixing to produce the final

solution should be zero. Hence

AH, = AH[ny +33] + AH[ny +(ns —y3)] . (5)

analogous expressions are obtained for the activity
coefficients y, and v3.

Introducing the numerical values of 4 and B deter-
mined in the previous section and the lattice parameters
for ThO,, Pa0,, and UO,,

A =2440 keal/mole B =2620 kcal, A, mole;
arho, =5.597 A; apa0, =5. 509 A; ;auo, =5.4704 A,

we may write the following expressions for the various
exchange equilibrium constants and activity coefficients
for ternary ThO,-Pa0,-UO, solid solutions:

(@1 — a2)? nun, + (ay — as)? myny + (2 —a)? ran 6)

 

Curves representing the variation of the three activity
coefficients with the composition of the oxide phase
are shown in Fig. 9.4.

From these expressions we may calculate that for a
salt containing

X1hE, =0.12, Xyp, = 0.003, Xp, =0.0003 ,

the oxide phase at equilibrium with it (at 600°C) will
have the composition

Xrho, = 0.036, Xvo, =0.95, Xpa0, =0.013.

This example serves to show that the oxide solid
solution precipitated from an MSBR fuel will contain

little protactinium. Specifically, the ratio of Pa/Uin the
oxide phase should be approximately one-seventh of
that in the salt phase. For oxide solutions so dilute in
Pa0, the values of yyo, and yrho, (Fig. 9.4) will not
be significantly different from those already determined
for binary ThO,-UO, solutions.” The estimates of
YPa0, for low concentration of Pa0,, varying from 1.0
to ~1.4, ought to be accurate enough for present
purposes. :

10.1 IN-LINE CHEMICAL ANALYSIS
OF MOLTEN FLUORIDE SALT STREAMS

J.M.Dale A.S.Meyer

Automated analyses for U(III) in LiF-BeF,-ZrF,-UF,
(65.4-29.1-5.00.5 mole %) in the NCL-21 thermal
convection salt loop were continued. The percent of the
total uranium present as U(III) for the first 3600 hr of
loop operation is shown in Figs. 10.1-10.3. These
analyses were largely made by unattended operation of
the computer-controlled voltammetric system described
in the previous report.! :

The first analyses, made 70 hr after the salt was

loaded into the loop, showed that the concentration of

UII) was about 0.02%. The U(III) concentration
started increasing as the chromium from the metal loop
dissolved into the salt’ and reduced the U(IV). The
irregular appearance of the ‘data at 600 hr was due to
large temperature fluctuations in the electrode tank.
The first measurements with the shielded electrode
were made at 1200 hr and are plotted as squares in Figs.
10.1 and 10.2. The shielded electrode is an assembly
designed to eliminate the interference of material from
the surface of the melt which apparently deposits on
the electrode and changes its area and electrical
characteristics. The electrode is surrounded by an
open-ended nickel tube which can be periodically
purged with helium to provide a clean melt surface.

- At about 1250 hr it was first noted that analyses with
the shielded and unshielded electrodes gave different

values for the U(III) concentration. This was later

concentration was already at a low value, the insertion
of the metal specimens appeared to introduce an
oxidant which caused a decrease in the U(III) concen-
tration. Special precautions are being taken for the next
specimen insertion to determine if this operation can be
performed without oxidizing the U(III). At 1725 hr the
shielded electrode, which had previously been removed
for examination, was put back into the loop without
immersing it into the salt. As shown in Fig. 10.2, the
U(IH) concentration decreased and then rapidly re-
covered, probably due to dilution effects caused by the

The voltammetric technique will also be used to
determine other melt constituents such as corrosion
product ions. In the reducing melts that have been
present in the loop the equilibrium concentration of
Fe(II) and Ni(II) is negligible, while all of the chromium
is present in the ionic form. In fuel melts, Cr(I) is the
most difficult of the corrosion products to measure
because its reduction potential is so close to that of
U(IV) (see the next section of this report). One of the
proposals which we have made but not demonstrated is
that chromium can be determined by a stripping
technique. This technique is based on the fact that
metallic chromium, the reduction product of Cr(Il), is
deposited on the electrode, whereas U(III), the reduc-
tion product of U(IV), is soluble and diffuses back into
the melt. Thus if the electrode is held at a potential that
is sufficiently cathodic to reduce both U(IV) and Cr(II),
the U(III) will rapidly approach a steady-state concen-
tration at the electrode surface, while chromium metal
is continuously deposited. When the electrode is elec-
trolytically stripped by an anodic scan, the contribution
of U(III) should be independent of reduction time,
while the stripping current from the chromium metal
should increase with plating time.

Figure 10.4 shows some typical stripping curves for
chromium at the 100-ppm level in the salt. Chromium
was plated on the working electrodes for different
lengths of time at —-360 mV vs Egq and then stripped
from the electrode at a scan rate of 0.1 V/sec. When
these stripping currents were integrated with the volt-
ammeter and plotted vs plating time, an excellent
straight-line relationship was obtained. Extrapolation to
zero plating time showed that about 4.5 mC of the
current, a reasonable value, was due to reoxidation of
U(III) to U(IV). In theory, the slope of the curves of
integrated current vs plating time should be propor-
tional to the toncentration of chromium ion in the
melt. Although gradual increases in the slope of such
curves which may correspond to increases in the
concentration in the melt have been observed, we have

not accumulated sufficient analytical data to establish
the analytical validity of this technique.

In summary, the results of the ratio measurements
have, in general, shown excellent reproducibility and
have been consistent with the known factors of loop
operation. Although several - problems (such as the
offset in the potential of shielded electrodes, smaller
offset voltages observed between the reference and
working electrodes, and the establishment of accurate
calibrations for the determination of corrosion prod-
ucts) remain to be solved, our experience gives us
considerable confidence that this relatively simple
transducer system can be widely applied to other test
systems and ultimately to in-line reactor streams. The
measurements also provide an explanation for the
lower-than-expected results obtained in attempts to
apply this technique to the hot-cell measurement of
U(IV)/U(III) ratios in MSRE samples.® Despite all our
precautions, the contamination introduced during the
sampling and transfer of the MSRE samples must have
been at least equivalent to that observed during the
introduction of corrosion specimens to the NCL-21

‘loop. It should be noted, however, that although these

MSRE analyses provided little relevant data as to the
ratio in the fuel, they indicated no evidence for
interference to the method from the radioactivity of
the samples.

10.2 THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS OF THE
VOLTAMMETRIC IN-LINE DETERMINATION
* OF URANIUM(III)

J.M. Dale

80

The present method for determining the uranium(III)

concentration in MSR fuel involves the measurement of
the potential difference between the equilibrium poten-
tial of the melt and E, ,, the voltammetric equivalent
of the standard potential of the U(IV)/U(III) couple.

The equilibrium potential of the melt, Egg, is the
potential of an inert platinum wire immersed in the
melt and depends upon the U(IV)/U(III) ratio. The
standard potential, Ey ;, is the potential on the UV)
reduction wave at which the concentrations of U(IV)
and U(II) are equal. The relationship between Egg,

Ey 2, and U(IV)/U(I) is given by

_ RT, UAV)
Feq Exptople ud)

 

Because the voltammetric circuit uses EF EQ asa refer-
ence potential, we can consider it to be zero and

_g RT, uav)
1/2" 0F © UQ)

Evaluation of E,,, with respect to Egg then permits
the U(IV)/U(III) ratio to be calculated.

Nicholson and Shain® have reported a solution to the

boundary ‘value problem that can be applied to this
system. They found for a reversible couple where both
species are soluble that E, j2 corresponds to the
potential on a theoretical reduction wave where the
current is 85% of the peak current. The experimental
U(IV) reduction wave, however, from the NCL-21
thermal convection loop also involves the reduction of
chromium, which could adversely affect the potential at
which the 85% point occurs. For this reason it was of
interest to compare the theoretical reduction wave with

the U(IV) reduction wave from the experimental

system.
The potential, E, of the working electrode during a
voltammetric scan is represented by

In order to get a true theoretical current-potential curve
it is necessary to solve for the values. of chi at small
voltage intervals, as each successive value of chi depends
upon all of the previously determined values. A
program was written for the PDP/81 for the numerical
evaluation of the chi values over an 800-mV range at

x(a?) and Ax(at)/At, these two expressions were used
for the construction of the theoretical current-potential
curve and its derivative.

In Fig. 10.5 the experimental waves are represented
by the solid lines, and the theoretical waves are
represented by the points plotted at 10-mV intervals.
There is the expected deviation in the region where
Cr(1l) is reduced (0.4 to —0.5 V), both on the normal
and derivative waves. The experimental derivative peak
is lower because the Cr(II) reduction causes the normal
wave to rise less sharply in this region. However, the
potentials at which the two derivatives show a maxi-
mum agree to within 5 mV, and there is good
agreement between the experimental and theoretical
values of E45. It is concluded that the chromium
reduction does not affect the current-potential curve
for the U(IV) reduction at the £,,, potential and that
the method for determining Ey ;, is valid.

10.3 ELECTROANALYTICAL STUDIES OF
TITANIUM(IV) IN MOLTEN
LiF-BeF ,-ZrF, (65.4-29.6-5.0 MOLE %)

D.L.Manning Gleb Mamantov’.

Since reporting on the voltammetry and chrono-
potentiometry of titanium(IV) in molten LiF-NaF-KF,?
we have continued these studies in molten LiF-BeF,-
ZrF 4. The initial voltammetric studies were undertaken
using K,TiF¢ as the solute; however, the results of
titanium(IV) reduction were greatly complicated by the

ot

observed instability of Ti(IV) in the melt. White
deposits collected in the cooler part of the electrolytic
system after K,TiFs was added to the melt. The
volatilization of titanium tetrafluoride from the melt
was confirmed in a separate experiment in a closed
stainless steel vessel provided with a cold trap; the
volatile product collected was identified as TiF4 by
x-ray analysis.

Voltammetric studies of the oxidation of tita-
nium(III) in molten LiF-BeF,-Z1F, at S00° were then
initiated, since TiF; was expected to be stable in the
melt at this temperature. (The sublimation point of
TiF; is 930° in vacuo.)
- Well-defined linear-sweep voltammograms for molten
LiF-BeF,-ZrF, containing Ti(III) were obtained at a
sheathed glassy carbon electrode. Similar but less-well-
defined waves were obtained at an unsheathed platinum
electrode. The wave corresponds to the anodic oxida-
tion of Ti(Ill) to Ti(IV). This was the only wave
observed upon addition of TiF; within the potential
limits of the melt, +1.5 to —1.5 V measured at the
platinum vs nickel(II)saturated)/nickel reference elec-
trode (LaF; membrane type). These potential limits
correspond to anodic dissolution of platinum and the
reduction of Zr(IV) respectively. A plot of ij, vs vi/2
resulted in a straight line which is indicative of a simple
charge transfer reaction. The concentration dependence
of i, was also linear.
- The standard electrode potential E° for the
Ti(IV)/Ti(IlI) couple may be estimated from the E, ,
for the process Ti(Ill} = Ti(IV) + e in molten
LiF-BeF,-ZrF, at 500°C. The Ej, is +0.380 V with
respect to the Ni(II)(saturated)/Ni(II) reference elec-
trode. However, an extrapolation of a Nernstian plot of
the nickel couple to unit mole fraction of nickel(II)
gives a potential that is 183 mV more anodic than the
potential corresponding to the saturation point of
nickel(II). Applying this correction of —183 mV to
relate the potential of the reference electrode to the
potential of ‘a unit fraction Ni(II)/Ni couple, E° for the
Ti(IV)/Ti(IlI) couple in molten LiF-BeF,-ZrF, at
500°C is estimated at +0.197 V (vs a unit mole fraction
Ni(II)/Ni electrode).

The chronopotentiograms recorded at a sheathed

glassy carbon electrode were reasonably well defined.

10.6 VOLTAMMETRIC AND HYDROLYSIS STUDIES
OF PROTONATED SPECIES IN MOLTEN NaBF. 4

D.L. Manning A. S.Meyer

We are continuing our investigation of the electrolysis
of hydrogen from NaBF, melts at evacuated palladium
electrodes. For the reduction of hydrogen, most
electrode materials yield ‘ill-defined and ragged volt-
ammetric waves characteristic of gas film formation.
However, at the palladium electrode the deposited
hydrogen rapidly dissolves into the electrode to elimi-
nate ‘the film formation and gives well-defined volt-
ammograms. Moreover, if the electrode is held at a
sufficiently cathodic potential, some of the deposited
hydrogen enters the evacuated portion of the electrode
to yield a measurable pressure. Both of these techniques
offer promise for a sensitive method for the in-line
determination of protons in the coolant salt, with the
pressure ‘measurement technique offering the advantage
of specificity.

During this period we have changed our experimental
conditions by enclosing the melt in a nickel vessel as
opposed to the quartz and Pyrex system that we usually
use to protect molten fluoride salts. In both cases the
actual melts are contained in a graphite liner under a
static pressure of helium and make no direct contact

with the protective envelope. In contrast with the
instability of the protonated species observed in the
glass-enclosed systems,!? the reduction waves in the
metallic container were stable indefinitely in melts
containing from 14 to 40 ppm hydrogen, according to
infrared analyses. The effect of glass containers on the
stability of these melts is surprising, because the only
communication to the container walls is through the gas
phase. This behavior is consistent with the observations
that the absorption peak of the BF;0D~ ion faded
during measurement on melts contained in quartz
cells.!3

We are now attempting to calibrate both of these
types of measurements for analytical applications. This
work is complicated by variations in the rate of
diffusion through the electrode material and also by a
low correlation of concentration between peak reduc-
tion currents, assuming a: reasonable diffusion coeffi-
cient value and the analyses of the melts by the infrared
pellet technique. Currently, we are investigating elec-
trodes fabricated from silver-palladium alloys and are
considering the possibility that the observed voltam-
metric wave results from the reduction of only one of
multiple protonated species in equilibrium in the melt.

ratus. Some or all of the measured hydrogen attributed
to the sample may have resulted from increased

exchange of the OH™ in the Pyrex ampuls due to

etching. The only eutectic salt samples available at that

time contained 20 to 30 ppm protons (IR); the only
significantly lower proton concentration was in a
sample of recrystallized NaBF,. It is conceivable that a
fortuitous difference in etching rates between the two
samples could have yielded :the excellent agreement
obtained. During this period these Pyrex blanks have
been reduced from 8 micromoles in a typical sample to
4 micromoles of H, (these values correspond to 10 and
5 ppm protons respectively). This reduction in blanks
was accomplished by prolonged heating of the Pyrex
ampuls at a temperature near their softening point in-a
stream of helium prior to the addition of any sample.
Data collected on the correlation of mass spectral and
IR determinations of protons in NaF-NaBF, samples
are given in Table 10.1. °
Most of the results of this comparison are in
acceptable agreement between the two methods. Occa-
sional high results by the mass spectral method are not
unexpected in view of the experimental difficulties of
handling of samples and ampuls. Moreover, no sys-
tematic variation is observed with improvements in the
blank. We therefore conclude that the results of the IR
analyses do indicate that a significant concentration of
- hydrogen is: present in the samples submitted from

From further experimental work with SiO, ampuls, we
have concluded that they are unsatisfactory due to
excessive diffusion of H, through the walls of the
ampul.

From the results given in Table 10.1 it can be noted
that the proton concentration, by IR analysis, varies
from 9 to 24 ppm. Until this period, not much variation
was seen in the proton concentration, particularly low
concentrations, in any NaF-NaBF, sample that had
been melted. The 7-ppm value reported last period was
for purified NaBF, that had never been melted: During
this period, attempts have been made both to obtain
melts of very low and relatively high proton (as
BF3;0H") concentrations. In this respect, by carefully
controlling experimental conditions and proper pre-
treatment of apparatus, it has been possible to prepare
melts of NaF-NaBF,4 that had 6.5 to 7 ppm protons,
based on IR analysis. Under our experimental condi-
tions we have not yet been able to prepare melts of
lower proton content. For several reasons we desire a
melt which has no detectable proton concentration, and
this work is continuing. Attempts have been made to
make standard additions of protons to NaF-NaBF,

melts for use in the analysis evaluation. Using melt

containers that are in an inert atmosphere, but exposed
to thermal gradients within the system, apparently only
25%, in the best cases, of the protons added, as HBO,,
NaOH, NaHSO,, or KHSO,, remain in the melt.
Containers which will be sealed and isothermal are
being designed for further standard addition work,

In summary, from our work it would appear that the
IR analyses given by the analytical service laboratories
are reasonably accurate for the pellet as pressed for the
spectral measurement. Whether this value is the same as
the proton concentration when the sample was molten
remains to be proven. Certainly the IR analyses show
the variation in proton concentration in the direction
expected for a variation of a given experimental

parameter. In line with the pellet work, we are also
engaged in IR spectral studies of NaF-NaBF, melts in

cooperation with J. B. Bates and G. E. Boyd (Director’s
Division). This work is reported in Chap. 7.

10. 8 SPECTRAL STUDIES OF MOLTEN SALTS
J.P. Young - .

Miscellaneous ‘spectral studies of “solute species in

molten LiF-BeF,-based solvents and molten LiCl have
been carried out in cooperation with, and as an aid to,

personnel from other divisions who are studying melts
of interest to the program. Several techniques have been
devised; several apparatus modifications have been
designed, and some built; and both new and previously
obtained spectral data have been applied to these areas
of investigation. ’ :

Based on the spectral results from Pa(IV) in molten
BeF,-based solvents obtained with the hot-cell spectro-
photometer,! 7 the spectral determination of Pa(IV) in
equilibrium with Pa(V) and Fe(II) offers a method for
determining the potential of the Pa(IV)-Pa(V) couple in
MSR solvent. Knowledge of this couple is important in
assessing a possible fuel reprocessing scheme involving
the precipitation of Pa, Os. In cooperation with C. F.
Baes, C. E. Bamberger, and R. G. Ross (Reactor
Chemistry Division), we plan to undertake such a study.
The ability to use small (~300-mg) samples in the
spectral technique has led to the proposal and approval
to perform these experiments with palladium out of the
hot cell. Techniques for sample transfer and treatment
are much simpler if the experiment can be performed in
the laboratory. A new sample transfer apparatus has
been designed and will be constructed which will ensure
no contact of the palladium sample with the laboratory
atmosphere when it is transferred from the palladium
glove box to the spectral furnace. The same general
design will likewise ensure transfer of other samples
from inert-atmosphere boxes to the spectral furnace
without any exposure of the sample to the atmosphere.
The transfer container makes use of two Cajon O-ring
fittings arranged so that one O-ring seals the bottom of
a sample spectral cell, windowed or windowless. The
salt sample is within the cell, and the cell is attached to
a rod within a cavity that serves as the transfer
container. The rod protrudes through and is sealed by
the second O-ring fitting. The bottom of the transfer
container can be sealed to the spectral furnace in the
normal fashion. After the transfer container with a
sample, loaded in a glove box or inert-atmosphere box,

85

is sealed to the spectral furnace, the sample can be

introduced into the furnace by loosening the two Cajon
fittings; they will remain gas-tight during this process,
however. For possible use in the palladium experiment
as well as in other experiments, it is advantageous at
times to bubble gases into melts used in spectral studies.
It has previously been thought that gases could not be
bubbled through liquid contained in a windowless cell,
because the agitation would cause the liquid to run out
of the cell. By using tubing of small inside diameter

17. J. P. Young, MSR Program Semiannu. Progr. Rep. Aug.
31, 1970, ORNL-4622, p. 114.

(e.g., 0.006 in.) and outside diameter (<0.062 in.), it
has been found that gas can be passed through liquids
without spillage. At least 4 ml of helium gas per minute
can be bubbled through 0.1 to 0.2 ml of liquid
contained in a windowless cell. Although liquid in'the
cell is agitated and stirred by the gas contact, the
stability of the total liquid shape is unaffected because
of the small size of the bubbles and because the bubbles
tend to rise in a region immediately surrounding the
purge tube. This procedure has been checked with both
water and molten LiF-BeF, in windowless cells. In
experiments to date, it is noted that the tip of the
bubbler tube plugs within 1 hr if helium gas is bubbled
through molten LiF-BeF, ; the reason for the plugging is
unknown, but several explanations are possible. Further
work is planned to bubble HF-helium and/or H,-helium
mixtures through melts to establish a particular redox
level for pretreatment of melts. The use of these gas
mixtures may also prevent tip plugging.

In cooperation with C. E. Bamberger and C. F. Baes,
the solubility of CuO in LiF-BeF, was studied in a silica
cell by a spectral study of the dissolved Cu(II). After
several days equilibration at 525°C the intensity of the
Cu(II) spectral peak at 880. nm remained constant.
Based on the molar absorptivity found by Whiting'®

for Cu(ll) in LiF-NaF-KF, approximately 2000 ppm

Cu(II) dissolved in the melt. We hope to expand and

‘combine work of this type with the thermodynamic

data of Baes and Bamberger for the system BeF,(d) and
Si0, (s) to study CuF, and CuF in LiF-BeF, melts. The
possible chemical reactions of copper containers with
various fluoride melts seem to be a fruitful and partially
neglected area of investigation.

Several spectral studies have been carried out with
personnel in L. M. Ferris’ group (Chemical Technology
Division), in' connection with fuel salt makeup and
reductive extraction.

Several attempts were made to transfer, melt, and -
spectrally observe a sample of U(V) in MSR salt
prepared by M. R. Bennett by reacting UF, with U(IV)
in the melt. Only a weak peak was seen at 1465 nm, the
wavelength of a sharp U(V) absorbance peak, and this
peak was only seen if the samples submitted by Bennett
were loaded in gold-plated cells. No spectral indication
of U(V) was observed if the samples were melted in
graphite or copper cells; rather, in these cells as the
sample melted, there was visual indication of gas
bubbles and resultant melt agitation, with the melt
immediately turning green and exhibiting the spectrum

of U(IV). In previous work with G. I. Cathers (Chemical
Technology Division), spectral studies of U(V) in

86

LiF-BeF, melts were undertaken; the solutions were .

prepared by adding Na, UFg to the molten solvent in a
graphite windowless cell. During this period this solu-
tion preparation was repeated. Once the U(V) solution
_was prepared, the melt was frozen and then remelted.
On remelting, no evidence of the U(V) spectrum was
seen. - These results suggest that something in the
thermal cycling of a sample containing U(V) may cause
a loss of U(V).

Spectra of solutions of Li3Bi in molten LiCl have

been observed during this period. If a sample is melted’

directly in a molybdenum windowless cell under our
experimental conditions, the melt immediately de-
colorizes. However, if the-sample is melted in the
presence of some lithium-bismuth alloy, there is an
initial loss of absorbance for several hours; then the
spectrum of the yellow melt is fairly constant. The

reported for LizBi in LiCI-LiF melts and consists
mainly of a strong absorbance in the ultraviolet region;
we do see a shoulder at 330 nm, however, which was
not previously reported.!® It is probable that we are
observing the spectrum of <150 ppm Li; Bi in the melt.
Some preliminary work with related species has also
been carried out. L. M. Ferris’ group has provided
samples of LiCl which have been in contact with
lithium-lead alloys. No positive results: have been

"obtained as yet, but it is interesting to note that,

_ analytically, much more lithium is found in the melt

spectrum we see for LizBi in LiCl is similar to that

than would be accounted for in the compound Lis Pb.
The spectrum of lithium was not observed in these
melts; however, in an earlier study of lithium in pure.
LiCl;,2° no measurable absorbance was observed at
similar concentrations.

11.1 THE OXIDE CHEMISTRY OF NIOBIUM IN
MOLTEN LiF-BeF, MIXTURES

Gann Ting®  C.F.Baes, Jr. G.Mamantov?

The chemistry of niobium in molten fluorides is of
interest to the MSBR program for several reasons. In
the MSRE it was observed that the appearance of
fission product Nb in the fuel seemed to be a
sensitive function of the state of oxidation (the U¥*/U?*
ratio) of the fuel. This effect, which presumably
involves the oxidation of the metal to a lower valence
state in solution, might be a useful indicator of the state
of oxidation of the fuel. Niobium pentoxide (Nb, Os),
like protactinium pentoxide (Pa, Os), is expected to be
sparingly soluble in molten fluorides, and it has been

- proposed that Nb(V) might be used as a stand-in for

Pa(V) in studies of fuel reprocessing methods involving
oxide precipitation. There may be some important
differences, however, between the chemistry of Nb(V)
and that of Pa(V). It seems likely that Nb(V), unlike
Pa(V), forms oxyions such as NbOF,**)~ in molten
fluorides.* In the system NiO-Nb,Os,5® at least two
intermediate compounds, NiNb, O¢ and NigNb, Oy, are
known, and since NiO is also a sparingly soluble oxide,
precipitation of these nickel niobates may be expected
to complicate the chemistry of Nb(V) in the presence
of 0%" and Ni** ions.

Weaver et al.’ equilibrated niobium metal and a
lower-valent niobium fluoride .in Li, BeF4 with hydro-
gen. Their results suggested the reaction

4HF(g) + Nb(c)= NbFa(d) + 2H (2), - (1)
Q1 = Xnvry Put, /Pur® ~ 1012 (500°C).

Senderoff and Mellors® report potentials, obtained
chronopotentiometrically, for the formation of Nb(I),
Nb(IV), and Nb(V) in molten LiF-NaFKF
(46.5-11.542 mole %) at 750°C. These indicate, in
agreement with the results of Weaver and Friedman,
that: Nb(IV) should be stable in the presence of nickel

or nickel-base alloys, Nb(I) should disproportionate to
the metal and Nb(IV), and Nb(V) should oxidize nickel
to form appreciable concentrations of NiF, in solution.

The purpose of the present study has been to explore
further the chemistry of niobium in molten fluorides by
means of equilibria involving oxide phases of nio-
bium(V). Two series of equilibrations have been com-
pleted thus far. In the first series, performed in a nickel
vessel, NiNb, Og and NigNb, Oy were formed. In the
second, performed in a graphite-lined vessel under
circulating mixtures of CO and CO,, the equilibrium
solid phase was Nb, Os. We will describe the second

series of measurements first.

11.1.1 Equilibrations of Nb, Os and BeO with
Molten LiF-BeF, Mixtures

The equilibrations were carried out in a welded
cylindrical nickel vessel (2% in. in diameter, 12 in.
long) with a graphite liner. Initially, 500 g of LiF-BeF,
(67-33 mole %) which had been purified by the usual
HF-H, treatment was placed in the vessel. Beryllium

After washing with hot water to remove the solvent
salts, these oxides were examined by various methods.
Emission spectroscopy revealed beryllium and niobium
to be the only metallic elements present in appreciable

-.-amounts. X-ray powder diffraction showed BeO to be

- present in all samples, 8-Nb, Os in two early samples,
and 7-Nb,O;° in samples taken near the end of the

series; the other samples gave an unidentified pattem,

perhaps for an unreported polymorph of Nb, Os. The
scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed well-
formed crystals containing major amounts of niobium.
From this evidence we conclude that BeO and Nb, Os
were the equilibrium phases.

Only traces of niobium were found deposited in the

+ cold trap or on the KBr windows of the IR cell. This is
consistent with the calculated! ® equilibrium constant
for the reaction

1, Nb, Os (c) + %BeF, (d)
= NbFs(g) + %BeO(c), (2),

log (Pyy Fg) = 2.05 — 11.76 (10°/T)

which predicts that the partial pressures of NbFs
generated in these equilibrations will be in the range
1072 t0 107° atm.

From the niobium content of filtered samples (Fig.
11.1) it appears that there was no effect of the CO, /CO
ratio, which was varied from 0.1 to 1.8. Since variation
of this ratio should have caused changes in the NbF,

" potential of the system (cf. reaction 3 below), the

amount of NbF, present evidently was small. Since,
moreover, no visible or ultraviolet absorption spectrum
corresponding to niobium(IV) was detected in filtered
samples,!! it is concluded that only niobium(V) was
present in appreciable amounts in solution. The
CO,/CO ratio was always higher than the values at
which Nb, Os is expected to be reduced to NbO,.!2

The conclusion that Nb(IV) was not present in
solution is confirmed by the following calculation.
From the estimate of Weaver and Friedman’ of the
equilibrium constant for the reduction of NbF, in
Li, BeF4 by hydrogen, one can calculate

AGS 130k [NbF4(d)] = —306.4 (kcal/mole) .

This, combined with AG values for Nb, Os, BeO, BeF,,
CO, and CO,, gives for the reaction -

Hence, the amount of NbF, in the solutions is expected
to be quite negligible.

With only Nb(V) present in solution in equilibrium
‘with Nb, Os(c) and BeO(c), we find that its concentra-
tion (Fig. 11.1) is far greater than would have been
predicted from the reported stabilities in molten fluo-
rides of NbF,7'® and NbFs® and the available free-
energy data for Nb, Os(c), BeO(c), and BeF,(d).!? In
particular, if NbFs is the component in the present
solutions we may calculate that NbF,(d) should dispro-
portionate completely to the metal and NbFs(d).

The evident stability of Nb(V) in the present system
is most plausibly explained by the formation of one or
more oxygen-containing species which, for the resent,
we will assume to be of the form NbOFx*3)~, The
data in Fig. 11.1 then may be represented by the
equilibrium :

¥% Nb, Os(c) + % BeF, (d)
= NbOF;(d) +%BeO(c), (4)

where, as usual, we represent the species in solution as
neutral components. The equilibrium quotient for the
reaction is defined as

Qs = XnboOF; -
* The results in LiF-BeF, (67-33 mole %) give

log Qs = 1.70 ~ 5.27 (10%/T)
In LiF-BeF, (52-48 mole %) they give

log 04 = 0.90 ~ 4.381 (0/1).
The expression for Q, in LiF-BeF, (67-33 mole %),
along with the estimate for Q,, and AGS values for
NbFs; Nb, Os, NbO,, BeO, and BeF, were used to
generate the Pourbaix diagram shown in Fig. 11.2.

‘The variation of Xp,or, (ie., of Qs) with melt
composition (Fig. 11.3) may be used to estimate the

activity coefficient y of the component NbOF; as
follows: K, may be written

Ka =XnboF, TNbOF5/@Ber,)?
wherein ager, is the activity of BeF, in the solution.
Hence

As has been customary in previous studies, we define
standard states such that YnyoF, = 1 and ager, = 1 in
Li, BeF4 (33 mole % BeF, ); hence

Ks =(Q)xp,, =0.33.

Introducing values for ager, , available from previous
measurements,'! 2 we obtain the activity coefficients for
NbOF; shown in Fig. 11.4. The rapid rise of YnpoF,
with Xper, in these melts suggests that NbOF,
competes strongly for the limited supply of fluoride
ions, forming an anion with at least a —2 or —3 charge,
that is, NbOF 5?” or NbOF 3".

11.1.2 Equilibrations Involving Nickel Niobates
in Molten Li, BeF,

In the first series of equilibrations, Nb, Os, BeO, and
NiO were equilibrated in Li, BeF, in a nickel container
under circulating argon. The apparatus and procedures
were otherwise essentially the same as described in the
previous section. Some difficulty was encountered in
obtaining filtered samples free of solids. As judged by
the reproducibility of the ?SNb and nickel content of
successive samples, this was corrected by use of a finer
porosity filter (maximum pore size 10 1). Equilibration
times were from 20 to 120 hr, decreasing with
increasing temperature.

At the outset of these experiments, only Nb, Os and
BeO were introduced; however, the nickel content of
filtered samples quickly rose to values expected for NiO
saturation, and, as will presently become clear, Nb, Os
was also being converted to NiNb; Og. The required
NiO presumably was supplied by inleakage of air early

in the run.

In discussing the results (points numbered in chro-
nological order in Fig. 11.5), it will be convenient to
refer to the phase diagram in Fig. 11.6. Here the -
boundary between the BeO and Nb, Os regions (re-

action 1, Table 11.1) is derived from the previously
described measurements of Q4. The boundary between
BeO and NiO (reaction 4, Table 11.1) is derived from
available thermodynamic data.'® The other boundaries
were generated from the data in Fig. 11.5 as follows:
Points 1 to 3. Since the nickel content in solution
indicated NiO saturation in these initial samples, and

the x-ray pattems of an oxide sample taken at point 5

indicated the presence of NiNb, Og and BeO as well, it
was presumed that the dissolved Nb(V) concentration
corresponds to point A in Fig. 11.6, at which all three
oxide phases are present and which is metastable with
respect to. the precipitation of NigNb, Qo. With the

position of this point presumably established, the line

corresponding to the boundary between BeO and

NiNb, O4 (reaction 2, Table 11.1) was drawn with the

required slope of —%.
After point 3, the apparatus was cooled to room

_ temperature, and NiO was added.

Points 4 and 5. The nickel content of the melt
appears somewhat lower and the niobium content
somewhat higher than previously. This may reflect the
conversion of small amounts of NiNb, Og to Nis Nb, Oy
according to reaction 6, Table 11.1. In the phase
diagram (Fig. 11.6) this would correspond to a move-
ment from point A toward point B.
 

»/

 

Point 6. Here the nickel content of the melt has fallen
well below the. value corresponding to NiO saturation;
however, the niobium content has not risen appre-
ciably. Hence, even though NigNb, Oy was detected in
minor amounts with the SEM, it is thought that the
system was still, in effect, near point 4.

Point 7. Here the SEM suggested major amounts of
NigNb, Oo, the nickel content of the melt remained
low, and the niobium content began to rise with time.
However, final equilibrium with respect to NiNb, Og,"
Nig Nb, Oy, and BeO (point B) was not established. The
dashed boundaries in Fig. 11.6, therefore, are located
only tentatively, being based on the amount by which
the nickel content of the melt was depressed at point 7.

On the basis of these results it is clear that the
solubility of niobium can be quite low (<10 ppm) in
melts containing appreciable amounts of 0” and Ni**

“ions. We plan next to equilibrate molten Li, BeF, with

Nig Nb, Oy and NiO. This should better locate one of
the dashed boundaries in Fig. 11.6, and hence the other
two as well. Also, there is an incentive for determining
experimentally the slope of the boundaries between the
NiO-Nb, Os phases, since this is related directly to the
formula of the niobium component in solution. In
particular, it may be shown that if the component has
the general formula

Nb, Oy Fs X-2y »

then the slope of the boundaries between the NiO-
Nb, Os phases will be

i Sx -2

slope =——.

PT

Thus further measurements will not only define more
precisely the solubility of niobium(V) in the presence
of 0% and Ni?" ions, but also test the validity of the
assumption that the niobium(V) species in solution may
be represented as the component NbOF;.

In the earlier work the chemistry of niobium and
molybdenum have been studied separately; the fact that
these elements appear together during reactor opera-
tions and fuel processing makes the interactions of their
fluorides of interest. The reaction of MoF¢ vapor with
niobium metal was observed for this reason.

The reaction was carried out in a copper Knudsen
effusion cell and monitored over a temperature range of
25 to 750°C. A similar study of the reduction of MoF

with molybdenum was reported earlier.22+23 The re--

sults of both experiments may be seen in Tables 11.2
and 11.3. In general the two reactions were similar. The
same molybdenum fluoride vapor products appeared at
nearly the same temperature whether the reducing metal

-was molybdenum or niobium. The oxygen impurity
was observed as oxyfluorides. In the temperature range
200 to 450° the MoOF, was dominant, while Nb, OF,
was favored in the range 500 to 750°C. No mixed
niobium-molybdenum species were observed, although

fluorides reacted with structural tantalum in the ap-
paratus, producing both the previously reported
MoTaF,,23 and the new NbTaF,,. Previously, the
determination of the cracking pattern for MoFs has
been impaired by simultaneous presence of much
Mo, Fo. In this study the small fraction of Mo,F,,
allowed the determination of a tentative cracking
pattern for MoFs, which is given in Table 11.4. The
oxyfluoride Nb, OF; was seen previously only in the
Nb, Os fluorination study.2® In the present work the
absence of monatomic niobium oxyfluorides allowed
the cracking pattern of the Nb, OF; to be determined.
It is shown in Table 11.5. B

In this study the ratio of MoF, to MoF; was greater
than found in the reduction of MoFs with molyb-
denum, possibly a reflection of the greater reducing
power of niobium compared with molybdenum. X-ray
diffraction analysis identified the residue in the cell at
“the conclusion of the study as being MoF; and
molybdenum. The niobium w was completely consumed.

then the untransformed interaction parameter must

the alkali fluoride—beryllium fluoride mixtures form

ideal solutions of M,;BeF; in MF, their limiting

interaction parameters should all be about 4 kcal/mole.
For LiF-BeF,, the interaction parameter is close to
this, 5 kcal/mole. However, in order to be consistent
with the application of conformal ionic solution theory
to other alkali—alkaline-earth fluorides, the interaction
parameters would be expected to exceed 10 kcal/mole
for RbF and CsF. This seems to be the case,2® as shown
in Fig. 11.9, although the conclusion is based on data
which had not been intended to provide accurate
chemical potentials. However, the interaction param-
eters are not likely to be in error by 6 kcal/mole. It is
striking that the ionic model leads to useful predictions,
even though strong Raman bands have been reported
for BeF,2 ion in LiF-BeF, and NaF-BeF, melts. 3°

composition, suggests a number of interesting con-
sequences®2 of possible theoretical and practical im-
portance. These are being tested by electrochemical
scanning methods including voltammetry, chrono-
potentiometry, potential step methods, etc. Such
methods have been useful previously in characterization
and analysis of electrolytes, including molten salts, but
primarily with solutions dilute in electroactive species.
Here. the electroactive constituent [Be(II)] predomi-

An electrochemical cell consisting of a small beryllium
electrode and a large inert electrode in an alkali
fluoride—beryllium fluoride melt may be expected to
show appreciable difference in electrical conductivity
for anodic or cathodic current at the beryllium elec-
trode. Anodically, a film of virtually pure (highly
resistive) BeF, should be formed at the beryllium
electrode as the current-carrying alkali cations migrate
away. On reversal of polarity, BeF, is reduced at the
beryllium electrode, its supply then being diffusionally
replenished by the large concentration gradient. The
system should thus behave as a two-state device of high
or low resistance. Furthermore, the relaxation time of

the high-resistance film of BeF, on current reversal

should depend on the beryllium-alkali ratio in the melt

and could conceivably provide the basis for an analyti- .

cal method for this ratio.

Preliminary chronopotentiometric measurements? ?
made at a beryllium electrode in an NaF-BeF, melt
containing approximately 75 mole % BeF, appear to be
qualitatively consistent with the predicted behavior.
The extremely well-defined transition times encourage
further study. Figure 11.10 shows a measurement of
emf of the beryllium indicator electrode relative to a
beryllium reference electrode in NaF-BeF, (~75 mole
% BeF, at ~490°C) during passage of a constant
current, first anodically and then cathodically, between
the beryllium indicator electrode and a large nickel
counterelectrode. On passage of constant anodic cur-
rent at the beryllium electrode, the measured potential
first rises rapidly to a nearly constant value as,
presumably, Be(II) is formed in the melt. A rather
abrupt rise in electrode potential is then required to
sustain the constant current, possibly associated with
the formation of a resistive BeF, film. On reversal of
polarity, the potential drops very rapidly to a.nearly
constant value, suggesting rapid reduction of the BeF,
film and indicating a much smaller concentration
polarization cathodically than anodically.

“experiments had been to determine the manner in
which melt composition affected the increase in resis-
tivity and the change of activation energy in the region
between the normal molten salt and the glass transition
temperature. It was not possible, however, to avoid
nucleation during extensive slow supercooling of the
melts, and a cell is being designed for conductance
measurement during warming of quenched glasses.

Equilibration was followed by measuring UF; and UF,
concentrations in a diamond-windowed graphite spec-
trophotometric cell as a function of time using a Cary

tern analyses were used to identify the uranium carbide
formed. However, some uncertainty in the carbide
identification was caused by the small amount. of
material which was sampled. In addition, the UF,/
(UF; + UF,) values reported at equilibrium and recalcu-
lated in Table 11.6 as equilibrium quotients, Q =
(UF,3)*/(UF,)*, were unusually low when compared to

Long and Blankenship’s previous data.?®

the back reaction of Eq. (1) using pure uranium
carbides to reduce UF, solution i in LiF-BeF, (66-34

UF; and graphite.
The relative magnitudes of the equilibrium quotients,
Q = (UF;)*/(UF,)?, for reactions (2) through (4) can _
be predicted using previously established free energies
of formation for the uranium carbides and assuming the

 
 

 

 

activity coefficients for UF; and UF, do not change
for the three equilibria. The free energies of formation
for UC, %U,C;, and UC, at 550°C are reported to be
—24.83% —24.81,%° and —22.363° kcal/mole respec-
tively. It is expected that Qpq.(3) < QEq.(2) <
-Okq.(4); that is, either U,C; or UC should be the
stable carbide phase in contact with the UF;-UF,
solution at 550°C.

To experimentally test these predictions, very pure
samples of UC, U, C3, and UC, were obtained from Los
Alamos Scientific Laboratory sealed in glass ampuls and
used to measure Q values as described for Eqs. (2)—(4).
Although for the more active carbides a process such as
shown in Eq. (1) would be simultaneously occurring,
equilibria involving these more active carbides can be
measured by adding excess reagent carbide and taking

* advantage of the fact that the reaction rates of Eqs.
(2)—(4) are fast with respect to Eq. (1).
Equilibrium quotients measured spectrophotomet-

100

rically in the graphite cell for Eqs. (2)—(4) are shown’in:

Table 11.7. These indicate that the stable carbide phase
is UC, and not U,C3 or UC. Furthermore, UC, was
identified as a product of reaction (2). Equation @: was
then modified to include the product UC,
= 4UF; + UC, .

2UC + 3UF, (22)

The other two reagent carbides produced no detectable

carbide products and so remain with only graphite as

the reaction product.
Equilibrations similar to these were performed in
sealed evacuated nickel capsules in the presence of an

atmosphere of 4% hydrogen—argon gas. The same
results were found for these experiments as those

conducted in graphite cells.

Using the measured Q values in Table 11.7 at 550°C
and the previously established AG°s,3 for U,Cj as
—49.62 kcal/mole,*! AG®s,3 for UC and UC, can be
calculated assuming the activities of the pure phase
carbides are unity and that the activity coefficients for

UF; and UF, do not change from Eq. (2) to (4). These -

new values for UC and UC, are found to be —24.03 and
-.~28.0 kcal/mole respectively.

The equilibria of Egs. (22), (3), and (4) lead to the’

conclusions: (1) the stable carbide phase in contact

with LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) solutions of UF5-UF, is -

UC,; (2) the equilibrium quotient for Eq. (4) is much:
in agreement with the conclusions of Long and Blank-
enship, even though the value of AG’, 3 (UC,) which

they used from Rand and Kubachewski*? (20.1

kcal/mole) was different . from either the currently
accepted value or the one reported here; and (3) the

equilibrium quotient for Eq. (4) is considerably larger
than was given in the preliminary report and repro-
duced in Table 11.6.

This last conclusion suggests that the previously
reported UF 3 /(UF3 + UF,) ratios in Table 11.6 did not
involve equilibria with pure carbide phases but probably
involved an oxycarbide phase of fixed uranium activity.
However, this “oxycarbide” phase has not been identi-
fied. The equilibrium involving the “oxycarbide” phase
does point to a lower stability of UF; in graphite. As
long as pure carbides and/or graphite is present, the
UF3/(UF; + -UF4) ratio in solution is quite large
(approx 0.30 at 550°C), but when the system is
contaminated by oxygen the UF;/(UF; + UF,) ratio
will reach still lower values, represented by those in
Table 11.6.

from its Raman spectrum*# and from its very large
viscosity. According to Baes’ polymer model,**" the
addition of basic fluoride such as LiF to molten BeF, is
believed to cause breakage of these network links by

If an excess of fluoride ion is added, a complete .
disruption of the network results, and free BeF,*” ions
are formed.

Although Raman spectra for the two extremes in the
BeF, system have already been presented,****5 that is,
that of pure molten BeF, and that of BeF,%", no
evidence has been given to support the polymer model
mechanism of Eq. (1) which occurs in the intermediate
region. This region is the subject of the following

discussion, which includes Raman spectra in support of

the polymer formation mechanism.
The approach taken was to identify simple species
occurring during initial polymerization stages by com-

paring the Raman spectra of melts with those of known
species found in solid crystalline compounds. The jon
Be; F, 3, representing the first step in the polymeriza-
tion process, was sought in a number of alkali metal
fluoride—BeF, mixed-salt cdmpounds.*? Single crystals
of the congruently melting compound Na,LiBe,F,
were grown, and, from an x-ray structure determina-
tion,*® the presence of Be, F, 3", consisting of two Be-F
tetrahedra sharing a comer and having approximate C,y
symmetry, was verified.

The - Raman spectrum of polycrystalline
Na, LiBe,F,*® at 77°K is shown in Fig. 11.12. The
strong band at 525 cm™! is assigned to the symmetric
stretching mode involving both the bridging Be-F and
the terminal Be-F bonds. This mode is related to the
symmetric stretch of BeF4?™ at 550—560 cm™ but, it
should be noted, is displaced to lower frequencies.

Extensive usage of this frequency shift will be made in
characterizing the beryllium fluoride species as the melt

11.8 RAMAN SPECTRA OF MOLTEN AND
CRYSTALLINE POTASSIUM DICHROMATE*®

J.B.Bates L.M.Toth A.S.Quist G.E. Boyd

Raman spectra of the room-temperature phase of
crystalline K,Cr, 0; and spectra of aqueous potassium
dichromate have been reported recently 59:51 References
to.earlier spectroscopic studies with dichromate are cited
in refs. 50 and 51. A more comprehensive investigation
of the Raman spectrum of K,Cr, 0; was undertaken
because: (1) The room-temperature (triclinic) phase is
known to have a unit cell structure in which the Cr,0,%
ions occupy two sets of nonequivalent sites. Multiple-

site effects have been proposed as the primary cause of
- mode splitting in spectra of several crystalline materials

(MoF;s and Na, COs) studied in this Laboratory.52:53
It was therefore of interest to investigate a material in
which a “two-site” effect could be well established. (2)

‘The Cr,0,% ion has a C,y molecular structure in the

molten and crystalline state isomorphic with that of the
Be, F,3 ion; it was hoped that the present study would
aid in interpreting the spectrum of the latter species.
Single-crystal Raman spectra were recorded at 77 and
300°K using the 6328-A line of a helium-neon laser for
excitation.5® Low-temperature spectra at frequencies
above 300 cm™! are well represented in Fig. 1 of ref.
50. Hence, only the spectra observed at 77 and 300°K
in the region below 300 cm™ are shown in Fig. 11.15.
At ca. 269°C, K2Cr,0, undergoes a phase transition
from the triclinic form to a structure reported to be
monoclinic.5% Spectra were obtained at temperatures
above and below the transition point from a single
crystal placed in the high-temperature Raman furnace.

K,Cr,0, are collected in Table 11.8. The Raman
spectrum of molten K,Cr, 0, (mp = 398°C) was
measured at 435°C from a sample contained in a Pyrex
capillary tube. The spectrum of a saturated aqueous
solution of dichromate at 25°C was also obtained. The
melt and solution spectra are presented in Fig. 11.17,
and the frequencies observed from these experiments
are given in Table 11.8.

The low-temperature (<269° C) structure of crystal-
line K,Cr, 0, is triclinic with four Cr,0;2 ions in the
primitive unit cell. The lattice is centrosymmetric and
belongs to the space group C;'. The four Cr, 0,% ions
occupy two sets of nonequivalent sites. The observed
splitting of the vibrational modes of Cr, 0,% .in the
low-temperature solid phase is thus due to a two-site
effect. Each anion mode gives rise to a single Ag
component (Raman active only) and a single 4,
component (infrared active only) as a result of dynamic
coupling between two equivalent anions. The other
equivalent pair of anions in the unit cell also gives rise
to A, + A, crystal states. Thus, for example, v, =
4° +g b+4,%+A,°, and the 914-909 cm™ pair of
Raman bands (Fig. 11.15) indicates a two-site splitting
of 5S cm™! for »,. Similar assignments can be made for
the B; and 4, modes observed in the 750- and 560-cm™
regions respectively (Table 11.8). In other regions of

lapping of mode frequencies precludes a unique assign-
ment. It is interesting to note that measurements of
polarized Raman spectra with single crystals are of
small value in assigning the observed bands, since all
Raman-active phonons have the same symmetry, that is,

“The ‘spectra’ presented in Fig. 11.16 show that the

"two-site splitting of », and v3; can be detected at

temperatures just below the transition point. In the
high-temperature phase, single bands were observed for

-both these modes. The change in the crystal structure

results in a change in symmetry of the factor group
states, while the number of k = 0 states is the same in
both phases. In the monoclinic phase, each molecular
state gives rise to four factor group states. For example,

Vi(4,)> Ag+ By + Ay +B, .

The single symmetric bands observed for », and »;

were assigned to 4, components because the intensity
of the B, component is expected to be much less than,

that of the 4, component. Furthermore, the Ag-Bg

splitting which. arises from correlation field coupling
may be much less than the 4,-4, splitting observed in
the triclinic phase as a result of the two-site effect.
. Particular attention was given to the measurements of
the low-frequency region in the molten and crystalline
phases of K, Cr,0,. The molten-salt spectra (Fig. 11.17)

tively assigned to an A, torsional mode denoted by »,.

The frequency of this mode appears to undergo large
shifts with temperature in the solid phases. At liquid-
nitrogen temperatures (Fig. 11.15), v, also exhibits a fine
structure which may be a result of interaction between
this mode and the lattice phonons of dichromate. A
similar interaction may also occur between p, and.

low-frequency ‘hindered librations of dichromate ions in
the molten salt. A better understanding of internal-- ~

extemal mode coupling of species in molten salts is
important in interpreting the results obtained in melts
in which polymerization can occur, such as the
LiF-BeF, system (see sect. 11.7 of this report).

. liquidus. The positive deviation from ideality for the

iodide liquidus, that is, excess partial free energy of
mixing pE py > 0, at concentrations greater than about
20 mole % M;BeF, (and probably at even lower
concentrations) may be compared with the LiF liquidus
in the LiF-Li,BeF, system, which is ideal up to

approximately 45 mole % Li, BeF,.5¢ In mixtures with

a common anion, the polarization energy usually makes
the overwhelming contribution to the interaction po-
tential. On the other hand, the much smaller interaction
potentials for mixtures with a common cation result
from a delicate balance between the positive contribu-
tions of the Coulomb and van der Waals energies and
the negative contributions of the repulsion and polariza-
tion energies. It is tempting to offer an explanation for

"the more positive - deviation from ideality when

Li, BeF, is added to Lil than to LiF by juggling the
changes in magnitude of the four effects above with a
change from I” to F~. However, we must also remember

that the differences reflected in the phase diagrams are’

due to partial excess free energy of mixing and not
necessarily to the enthalpy of mixing, which determines
the interaction potential. The explanation for differ-
ences in degree of nonideality must then include
differences in the entropy of mixing for which little
data exists for these systems.

The M,BeF,4 liquidus lines all show positive deviation

from ideality, although to a much lesser extent than the
MF liquidus in MF-MI mixtures,’ especially in the
dilute MI region. The sodium system shows the greatest
nonideality, followed by the lithium system and then
the cesium system, with only a very small deviation
from ideality evident above 20 mole % Csl. Again, an
explanation for the differences in nonideality will
depend on a knowledge of the entropies of mixing.
+ Fusion enthalpies of Na,BeF, and Cs,BeF; were
calculated from the initial liquidus slopes to be 6.5 and
11.0 kcal, with a probable error of +5%. Fusion
entropies, 7.5 and 10.5 cal deg™! mole™, are consider-
ably less than the AS = 14.5 cal deg™ mole™ for
Li; BeF,. This is as expected, considering that Na, BeF,
and Cs; BeF, are isostructural with the corresponding
sulfates, while the Li,BeF, is isostructural with
Be, 8i0,.

Part 3. Materials Development

J. R. Weir

Our materials work is currently involved with several
important areas including (1) gaining a better under-
standing of the intergranular cracking of Hastelloy N

that occurred in the MSRE and a method of controlling

this cracking in future reactors, (2) developing a
graphite with improved dimensional stability under
radiation, (3) development of surface sealing methods
for reducing the permeability of graphite to 13° Xe, (4)
modification of the composition of Hastelloy N to
obtain an alloy that is more resistant to neutron
irradiation, (5) evaluation of Hastelloy N for use in
steam generators, (6) construction of a molybdenum
system for use with bismuth and fluoride salts, and (7)
the evaluation of other materials for use as structural
materials in the chemical processing plant.

The first area has occupied a high priority; additional
parts of the MSRE have been examined, and a rather
extensive program of laboratory tests has been initiated.
The laboratory tests are directed at determining the
cause of the cracking, the rate of progression with time
and temperature, and a reasonable solution to the
cracking problem.

The lifetime of a breeder core will be determined by
the dimensional stability of the graphite. Dimensional
changes can be accommodated to some extent, but
volume expansion is usually accompanied by increasing
permeability to xenon, which can become intolerable.
Thus the problem of dimensional stability cannot be
separated from the requirement of low permeability to
135Xe. We are evaluating graphites made by commer-
cial vendors and locally in an effort to understand what
types of graphite have the best dimensional stability.
This information is being fed back to commercial

vendors and into our own experimental fabrication

- program. Pyrolytic carbon coatings derived. from

propene are currently being studied as a ‘means of
reducing the permeability to ! ** Xe.

The program to develop a modified Hastelloy N with
improved resistance to radiation indicated that alloys
with additions of 1.5 to 2.0% Ti were most promising,
and recent efforts have concentrated on these. Material
has been obtained from three vendors that has been
made by two basic melting practices. The evaluation

includes weldability tests, unirradiated mechanical -

property tests, and postirradiation mechanical property
tests.

A corrosion facility in TVA’s Bull Run Steam Plant is
being used to .evaluate the corrosion of Hastelloy N in
steam. Both unstressed and stressed samples are in-
cluded in the tests.

Most of the work on chemical processing materials is
going into the construction of a reasonably complex
test facility constructed of molybdenum. Many new
techniques. have been developed which overcomé or
circumvent the basic difficulties of molybdenum fabri-
cation. (Welds in molybdenum are inherently brittle,
and fabrication into large sizes is hampered by the need
for high temperatures and large forces to fabricate large
parts.) The mutual requirement of compatibility with
bismuth and salt narrows the choice of materials for the
processing plant, but our screening tests offer encour-
agement that besides molybdenum, both tantalum and
graphite will be compatible. Experiments are being
started to determine whether these materials can be
used and under what operating conditions.

“12. Intergranular Cracking of Structural Materials
Exposed to Fuel Salt

H. E. McCoy

Examination of Hastelloy N components removed
from the MSRE has shown that all surfaces that came in

contact with fuel salt had intergranular cracks to a

depth of 1 to 13 mils. Some of the cracks were visible
when .the parts were removed from service, whereas
others did not appear until after the parts were
deformed. Our observations and experiments indicate

that this cracking is probably associated with fission

products, although we have not ruled out the possibility
that some yet-undetected mode of corrosion may cause
the cracking.

Our work involves (1) further studies of the materials
from the MSRE, (2) corrosion experiments to deter-
mine whether intergranular attack will occur under
certain conditions, (3) studies of alloys containing or
exposed to numerous fission products, (4) numerous
experiments with tellurium to determine its effects on
Hastelloy N, and (5) limited experiments with other
alloys such as type 304L stainless steel and nickel-200
to determine their susceptibility to cracking. Our
objectives are to determine the cause of the cracking;
the dependence of the rate on temperature, time, and
concentration; and a reasonable solution to the prob-
lem.

12.1 EXAMINATION OF HASTELLOY N
COMPONENTS FROM THE MSRE

B.McNabb  H. E. McCoy

Several Hastelloy N components from the MSRE have

been examined. Partial presentations of our findings
were made previously,!*? and additional results will be
presented in the current progress report. Some work is
still in progress, and it is likely that further observations
and interpretations of prior observations will continue
to be made for some time.

of the MSRE (FV 105) was examined further. The -

failure was attributed to fatigue from a modification
that had been made. The valve was made by flattening a

section of 1%-in. sched 40 Hastelloy N pipe and

welding an air cooling shroud around the flattened
section. This valve was used to isolate the drain tanks
and was frozen only when the salt was in the drain
tanks. The salt was static except when the reactor vessel
was being filled. It was filled with salt and maintained
above 500°C for about 21,000 hr. The valve was filled
with salt from the drain tanks, so the fission product
concentration that the valve was exposed to was
considerably lower than that seen by components in the
primary circuit. Thus the freeze valve was exposed to
another set of conditions involving fuel salt and fission
product concentration and may help in separating the
effects of each on the behavior of Hastelloy N.
Three rings % ¢ in. wide were cut from the pipe away
from the flattened section and were pulled in tension in
the same manner as previously described for the control
rod. thimble rings.® One rectangular piece was cut and
bend-tested with the ID of the pipe in tension. Table
12.1 is a tabulation of the observed mechanical prop-
erties. The yield stress was essentially unchanged, and
the ultimate stress was reduced about 15% from the
vendor’s certified properties. The elongation was re-
duced considerably but was still greater than 25%. A:
gage section is difficult to define in a ring test, so

from the remote cutting operation. One of the three
tensile-tested rings was examined metallographically.
Figure 12.2 is a composite of photomicrographs of a
section through the specimen showing the inside sur-
face, which was exposed to fuel salt (top), and the
outside, which was exposed to the cell environment of
nitrogen plus 2 to 5% O,. The reason for the uneven
nature of the oxide on the outside is not known.
Possibly it was due to corrosion after the leak, although
the rings were cut approximately 4 in. away from the
nearest visible residue from the salt leak. Figure 12.3 is
500X photomicrographs of the oxide in one of the
worst areas. The cracks tend to blunt and do not
penetrate into the metal beyond the oxidized surface.
Figure 12.4 is 500X photomicrographs of the inside of
the pipe exposed to fuel salt. There is about 1 crack per
grain, or 240 cracks per inch, but the cracks are shallow
and blunt, having an average depth of 0.75 mil and a
maximum depth of 1.5 mils. Figure 12.5 is a 40X
photomicrograph of the fracture and shows that a large
amount of strain occurred before fracture. | oo

From these tests we see that the mechanical proper-
ties of the Hastelloy N in the freeze valve were not
degraded seriously by the exposure to fuel salt with
some fission products for a long period of time.
Numerous intergranular cracks were present in the
surfaces exposed to the salt. These cracks were similar
to those in the surfaces from the primary circuit but
were shallower,

12.1.2 Control Rod Thimble

The control rod thimble was near the center line of
the MSRE core for the duration of operation. Because
it was exposed to the peak neutron fluence of any
component and to a relatively high concentration of
fission products, it has been of much interest and has
been studied rather thoroughly.’:® The additional
studies during this reporting period investigated a
possible effect of salt flow rate on the severity of
cracking.

The details of construction of the thimble are shown
partially by Fig. 12.6. The thimble was made of
2-in.-OD, 0.065-in.-wall tubing with occasional spacers.
The spacers had small ribs machined on them to ensure
that salt could flow between the thimble and the
adjacent graphite. The spacers were attached to the
thimble by a small weld bead on the thimble that was
made through a clearance hole in the spacer. Thus the
spacer was restrained vertically but could move some
radially. The shop drawings allowed a maximum diam-
etral clearance of 15 mils between the spacer and the
thimble. It is likely that most of the annulus was filled
with salt, but the flow rate should be very slow. Thus a
comparison of the cracking tendencies under the spacer,
where flow was restricted, and outside the spacer
should give- an indication of the sensitivity of the
cracking to flow rate." - |

A composite of photomicrographs of a deformed ring
from the thimble that was exposed to flowing salt is
shown in Fig. 12.7. The inside of the thimble was
exposed to the cell environment of N; plus 2 to 5% O,
and was oxidized. Cracks formed in the oxide but did
not penetrate the metal. The outside of the thimble,
which was exposed to fuel salt, had 192 cracks per inch,
having an average depth of 5.0 mils and a maximum
depth of 8.0 mils. A similar ring was cut from the
thimble under the spacer. It was deformed and ex-
amined metallographically. A composite of photo-
micrographs is shown in Fig. 12.8. This sample had 257
cracks per inch with an average depth of 4.0 mils and a
maximum depth of 8.0 mils. A ring was also cut from
the spacer for testing and examination. This sample was
exposed to flowing salt on one side and restricted salt
flow on the other side. A composite of photomicro-
graphs of this sample is shown in Fig. 12.9. The side

cracks per inch with an average depth of 3.0 mils and a
maximum depth of 5.0 mils. Although there are
differences in the crack numbers and depths on the
various surfaces, we do not feel that they are signifi
cant. .

Duplicate - samples from the same locations as the
mechanical property samples were dissolved and ana-
lyzed for fission products. The concentrations of
tellurium in atoms/cm? X 10'7 are given with each
sample location: (1) thimble, flowing salt — 2.9, 2.9;
(2) thimble, restricted flow — 0.95, 0.74; and (3) spacer
— 1.6, 4.5. The tellurium concentration under the
spacer, where the flow was restricted, is lower than on
the bare thimble by a factor of 3 to 4. The concen-
tration on the spacer sleeve is not detectably different
from that noted on the bare thimble. The other fission

products ‘that were analyzed showed similar trends.
Thus the severity of cracking was not influenced
appreciably by fission product concentrations that
varied by factors of 3 to 4.

12.1.3 Sampler Cage Rod

The sampler cage rod from the pump bowl that was
tensile tested to failure at room temperature showed
marked variations in the severity of cracking at surfaces
exposed to fuel salt and those in the gas space above the
salt.” Pan photomicrographs were made of the surfaces
of the rod exposed to liquid fuel salt and to the gas
above the salt. Figure 12.10 shows the variations of
cracking along the length and on opposite sides of a
%-in.-long segment of the rod from the fracture (right),

extending toward the bottom of the pump bowl (left).
The fracture occurred in the area of the largest deposits

‘on the rod, which was probably the average liquid level

in the pump bowl.® Unfortunately, the radial orienta-
tion of the rod was not maintained during mounting.
Additions of beryllium and uranium by means of the
sampler were made occasionally to adjust the chemistry
of the fuel salt, and local conditions in the sampler cage
could have been quite different from those in the bulk
salt stream. This might account for some of the
variations of cracking around the circumference of the
rod. Figure 12.11 is a pan photomicrograph of a %-in.
segment of the same rod starting % in. above the
fracture (left) and extending farther up into the gas
region (right). The surface cracking is diminishing in
severity, but the frequency is still almost one crack per
grain. The sampler cage rod represents about the worst
conditions of attack of any of the components ex-

-amined in the MSRE, with cracks opening up to a

maximum depth of 13 mils. However, the mechanical
properties were not degraded seriously, and the ob-

116

served small property changes may have been due to the
long time that the rod was held at high temperature.

Examination of this component shows clearly the
severe cracking that occurred in the pump bowl. It also
shows that the cracking diminishes in traversing from
the liquid into the sheltered gas region inside the mist
shield. :

12.1.4 Mist Shield

The mist shield was a spiral baffle of %-in. Hastelloy
N sheet whose purpose was to keep salt spray from the
region where fuel salt samples were taken in the pump
bowl. Four bend test specimens were cut from portions
of the shield that were exposed to different conditions
of fuel salt flow or spray. Macrophotographs and the
mechanical properties of the bend specimens from these
various locations appeared in the last semiannual

report.” At that time only two of the specimens had
been examined metallographically, but it was evident
that there were considerable differences in the fre-
quency and severity of the cracking in the specimens
exposed to the restricted salt flow and to the gas inside
the mist shield. During this report period we examined
the two samples that were taken from the outer end of
the spiral shield at top and bottom.

Bend specimen 8-62 came from the outer top portion
of the mist shield, where it had been exposed to fuel
salt mist. This specimen was bent, with the surface that
had been on the outside in tension, until it fractured.
Figure 12.12 shows the tension (top) and compression
(bottom) surfaces of the specimen. The depth of
cracking was only about 5 mils (except for the
fracture), but there was a tendency for grains to
become dislodged near the fracture (right). Cracking
was confined to a relatively small area around the
fracture, probably due to the relatively low fracture
strain of 11%. Figure12.13 shows photomicrographs of
the tension (2) and compression (b) sides of this bend
specimen. -

“Bend specimen S-68, from the bottom outer region of
the mist shield, had been immersed in salt that was
agitated and may have contained bubbles and materials
from the surface of the salt pool that were carried
under by the xenon stripper jets. A composite view of
this specimen is shown in Fig. 12.14. The tension side is
shown at the top and the compression side at the
bottom. The cracking on the tension side is spread over
a slightly larger area than in specimen S-62, and there is
less tendency for grains to become dislodged. The

cracking depth is about the same except for one crack
about 12 mils deep. Figure 12.15 shows photomicro-
graphs of the tension (2) and compression (b) sides of
bend specimen S-68. The outside of the spiral was the
tension side of the bend test, but the compression side
was also exposed to agitated fuel salt.

Comparison of the observations on these two speci-
mens from the outer portions of the mist shield spiral
and those reported previously from the inner end of the
spiral’ show that the cracking severity was greatest in
the outer gas sample, next most severe in the liquid
samples from inside and outside the shield, and least
severe in the sample from the inner gas region.

12.2 AUGER ANALYSIS OF THE SURFACE
LAYERS ON GRAPHITE FROM THE CORE
OF THEMSRE

R. E. Clausing

We continued to use Auger electron spectroscopy to
analyze deposits of fission products and/or corrosion
products on graphite - surfaces from the core of .the
MSRE. This technique offers unique capabilities for
analyses of the first few atomic layers of a surface. The
principles of construction and operation of the equip-
ment have been described,!® and results of analyses of
two samples from a core moderator element have been
reported. In these samples, relative concentrations of
the deposited elements were determined as functions of
depth below the original surface. Molybdenum, nio-

bium, rhodium, and technetium were present in
amounts estimated to exceed 5% of the exposed surface
layer. Tellurium and ruthenium analyses were difficult
because of interference from other elements; but both
elements appeared to be present in significant amounts.
Neither iron nor nickel contents were determined for
these first two samples.

Analysis of these samples and of several others has
now been completed. All of the results are summarized
in Table 12.2. Sample No. 6, the first analyzed, was
taken from a core surveillance specimen removed from
the MSRE in April 1968 at the conclusion of operation
with 225U fuel. The other samples were all taken as

0.3-in.-diam plugs by core drilling various parts of the
graphite moderator element 1184-C-19, which was
removed from the MSRE after shutdown in December
1969.11

The data in Table 12.2 are normalized relative to a
carbon peak of 100, and peak heights are given in
arbitrary units. The data are not yet-quantitative due to
lack of suitable standards, and it should be noted that
because the sensitivity is different for different ele-
ments and for different peaks for the same element,
peak ‘height cannot be equated to concentration. (We
intend to make our data quantitative by use of suitable
standards that are now being prepared.)

Samples 5, 7, and 10 were taken from the flow
channel: sample 5, 3 in. from the top; sample 7, in the
center; and sample 10, 3 in. from the lower end of the

element. Samples M6 and 13 were taken from the edge
of the graphite moderator element (outside the main
flow channel) with sample 13 about 3 in. from the
bottom end of the element and sample M6 about
halfway along the element length.

Sample 10 was examined in the scanning electron
microscope after sputtering approximately 16 atom
layers from the surface, and typical photographs are
shown in Fig. 12.16. Note that the sample surface is
fairly smooth but has a few small particles adhering to
it. These particles appear to be graphite dust, still
adhering from the core drilling operation, which should
not interfere with the Auger analysis. The smoothness
of the surface should ensure the uniformity of removal
of layers from the surface by sputtering.

All of the samples examined had substantial amounts
of molybdenum, technetium, sulfur, and rhodium. Iron,
nickel, and chromium were present on most of the
samples, with the two samples from the bottom of the
moderator element (samples 10 and 13) having the
largest concentrations. Tellurium is probably present on
all of the samples and is discussed briefly below. Peaks
which may be associated with antimony were detect-
able on samples 10 and 13, although the peaks are not
listed in Table 12.2. An unresolved pair of peaks
tentatively identified as due to palladium were detected
at 330 eV on nearly all of the samples. Tellurium,
chromium, and ruthenium concentrations are difficult
to determine because of interference from strong lines

amounts of tellurium and chromium are probably
similar in quantity to the largest amounts of iron. As of -

now, we believe that ruthenium is probably present, but
the lines are not nearly as strong as those for molyb-
denum. :

Low-energy Auger peaks like that at 20 eV for
tellurium are frequently very strong; thus, the large
amplitudes listed in Table 12.2 need not be associated
with high surface concentrations. of tellurium. Pure
tellurium would have several strong peaks between 400
and 500 eV, but our data do not disclose strong lines on
any of the recorded spectra at these energies.

12.3 AUGER ANALYSIS OF THE SURFACE OF
A FRACTURED HASTELLOY N SAMPLE

The surface of a Hastelloy N foil that was attached to
a retaining strap on a group of surveillance specimens in
the MSRE is being analyzed. After being exposed in the

core at operating. temperature for 7203 hr the foil -

"fractured intergranularly with little or no ductility. Part

of this strap is being examined extensively by other
techniques. Figure 12.17 shows scanning electron
micrographs of the fractured foil. The surface has the

faceted appearance of an intergranular fracture and.

shows some discrete particles in the boundaries. These
particles probably. are not responsible for the brittle
behavior; a very thin layer of brittle material spread
more uniformly over the grain boundaries is a more
likely cause of a brittle fracture like that observed. An
attempt is being made to determine if the agent
responsible for the brittle behavior can be identified on
the fracture surface with the use of Auger spectroscopy.

Table 12.3 shows some preliminary Auger data from
the flat surface of the 0.004-in.-thick foil and from the
fracture surface. The data shown were obtained on

surfaces sputtered only very lightly so that only about

two atomic layers were removed from the as-received
surface. The major difference seems to be the substan
tially larger portion of molybdenum on the fractured

carbides that form along the grain boundaries of
Hastelloy N. No tellurium was detected on either
surface.

The conditions under which this sample was fractured

and subsequently handled, including decontamination

by ultrasonic solvent cleaning and examination in the
relatively poor vacuum of the oil-pumped scanning
microscope, make it quite possible that material
strongly concentrated within the first few atomic layers
of the original fracture surface was no longer present at

_ the time of the Auger analysis or was covered with
other material so that it was no longer detectable.

Therefore, we plan to fracture another piece of the
same foil in the Auger system under ultrahigh vacuum
conditions and analyze it immediately. This technique

‘has been used to identify embrittling agents in the grain

boundaries of tungsten and should be useful for

* Hastelloy N if the fracture is through the embrittled
region, as it appears to be.

12.4 INTERGRANULAR CORROSION OF
HASTELLOY N

J. W. Koger
We are now using loop NCL-16 [Hastelloy N circu-

lating LiF-BeF,-UF4(65.5—-34.0—0.5 mole %)] in the

 
 

 

 

 

study of intergranular cracking of Hastelloy N in
molten salts. Specifically, we are investigating the
possibility that the attack is related to the localization
of normal corrosion processes to grain boundaries.

124

In any solid solution alloy where there is a difference

‘in nobility of the constituents, oxidation-reduction

reactions may result in removal of the least noble
constituent, with attack being preferential along grain

boundaries. In time, given a continuing electrochemical

process, this will lead to crevices in the grain bound.
aries. Diffusional processes within a crevice may lead to
its broadening and ultimately to the formation of pits.
However, if the root of the crack is anodically polarized
relative to the walls, knifeline attack will continue.
Such a condition may arise if the walls of the crevice
become covered with a very noble material (nickel or
molybdenum). This covering by a noble constituent can
occur either by the noble material remaining on the
wall when the least noble constituent is removed or by
dissolution of all the alloy constituents with subsequent
precipitation of the more noble constituents.

Prior to its use in the cracking studies, l100opNCL-16
had operated ‘for 29,500 hr with a fuel salt circulating
in the system. The maximum weight loss after this
period was 2.9 mg/cm? and the largest weight gain was
1.7 mg/em®. Assuming uniform loss, the maximum
corrosion rate was 0.04 mil/year. The chromium con-
tent of the salt had increased. 500 ppm, and the iron

had decreased about 100 ppm in 29,500 hr. Titanium- -

modified Hastelloy N specimens (Ni-12% Mo—7%
Cr—0.5% Ti) had smaller weight losses than standard
Hastelloy N specimens (Ni—16% Mo—7% Cr—5% Fe)
under equivalent conditions.

For our study of cracking we initially added 500 ppm
FeF, to the loop. Specimens were removed, weighed,
and portions of specimens examined metallographically
450 and 1100 hr after the first addition. Then an
additional 500 ppm FeF,; was added. Specimens were
then analyzed 800 and 1800 hr after this second
addition, with the total exposure to the highly oxi-
dizirig salt being 2900 hr.

After each removal we found weight changes typical
of all our temperature-gradient mass transfer systems,
with weight losses in the hot section and weight gains in
the cold section. Figure 12.18 shows the weight changes
of selected specimens as a function of time, and Fig.
12.19 shows the ‘changes completely around the loop.
Note that the balance point (the point at which there is
no weight change) did not shift. Note, also, that the
weight changes after the FeF, additions were relatively
large. The changes during the 450 hr after the first
addition equaled those during the previous 10,000 hr,
Weight changes. during the next 650 hr were 2 or 3
times those for the first 450 hr and. were larger than
those obtained during 29,500 hr of operation before
any additions.

additions disclosed grain boundary attack which altered

the polishing characteristics of the specimen, but no
cracks were visible. Examination of the hottest speci-
men 800 hr after the second addition revealed more
grain boundary attack but still no cracks. The surface of
the specimen was “lacy” due to severe corrosion by the

salt and chromium removal from the alloy. This

specimen was bent, and some cracking was induced in
the depleted area, but no cracks penetrated the matrix.
Specimen examination after the total 2900 hr exposure
disclosed that the weight losses were six times greater
than in the previous 29,500 hr operation of the loop,
and cracks were now visible to a depth of 0.5 mil. The
cracks (Fig. 12.20) seemed to be similar to those seen in
the MSRE samples but were much shallower.
We have also examined pieces from loop 1249, which
‘was operated about 12 years ago to determine the
diffusion coefficient of chromium in Hastelloy N at
high temperature. It operated with an NaF-ZrF, salt for
792 hr, and then 3720 ppm FeF, was added. Operation
continued for 264 additional hr. We took two pieces of

~ the loop piping, one from the hottest position (927°C

wall temperature and 860°C bulk fluid temperature)

 

126

and one from the cold leg (682°C), and bent them to
determine their cracking tendencies in the chromium-
depleted regions. The cold-leg specimen did not crack,
but cracks formed in the hot-leg specimen. The longest
extended 3 mils into the sample (Fig. 12.21), and
several small cracks about the depth of a grain were also
visible.

12.5 TUBE-BURST EXPERIMENTS
H.E. McCoy J. W. Koger

Tube-burst experiments at 650°C were run in three
environments to determine whether stres$ or environ-

ment had a detectable effect on the fracture character--

istics of Hastelloy N. Two sets of specimens were
tested: one with clean surfaces, the other with 0.01
mg/cm? of tellurium electroplated on the surfaces. The
tubular specimens were made from 1-in.-OD, 0.065-in.-

similar chemically to heat Y-8487, which was used to
fabricate the control rod thimble. The samples were

were helium, a fuel salt of composition LiF-BeF,-

ZrF4-UF, (65.4-29.1-5.0-0.5 mole %), and the fuel salt

with an’ addition of 500 ppm FeF, (300 ppm Fe).
Posttest analyses of the salt charges showed that the
clean fuel salt contained 110 ppm Fe and 89 ppm Cr
and that the fuel salt with FeF, contained 284 ppm Fe
and 120 ppm Cr. }

The rupture lives of unplated tubes in the various
environments are compared in Fig. 12.22. The rupture
life is independent of environment, except perhaps at
the lowest stress level. Even at this stress, the rupture
lives vary by. only a factor of 2, and additional
observations would be necessary to establish whether
the difference is reproducible. The tubes were exposed
to a two-dimensional stress, and the effective-stress—
effective-strain criteria would predict that for the same
maximum principal stress, the time to rupture for a
specimen under biaxial (2:1) stress should be about
12,1
The data in Fig. 12.22 indicate the opposite trend.
There is also a large difference in slope. The uniaxial

data were obtained primarily from heats from another .

vendor, and there were differences in chemical compo-
sition that may account for the differences in proper-
ties.

The uniform strains of the unplated tubes were
divided by the rupture life to obtain effective minimum
creep rates, shown in Fig. 12.23. There are no ob-
servable effects of environment outside of what is
considered reasonable data scatter. The creep rate of a
biaxially (2:1) stressed sample should be about 0.4
times that of a uniaxially stressed sample. The results in
Fig. 12.23 show the opposite trend and indicate that
the tubing is weaker than the bar and plate material
used to obtain the uniaxial data.

The fracture strains of the unplated tubes are sum-
marized in Table 12.4. The most important observation
is that there is no detectable effect of environment on
the fracture strain. Generally, the fracture strain de-
creases with increasing rupture life. This is the normal
trend, but the range of 10 to 2% for rupture lives of 20
to 1000 hr is larger than that noted for bar and plate
stock.!® The differences between the uniform and total

little third-stage creep. This was also indicated by the
fact that the failures in all but one of the tubes were
“pinhole” fractures that were difficult to locate and
exhibited very little bulging at the fracture.
Metallographic examination of the tubes revealed that

- the fractures were entirely intergranular (as is normal at

environment are shown in Figs. 12.24—12.26.

The stress-rupture properties of the tellurium-plated
tubes are shown in Fig. 12.22. The data from these
tubes exhibit more scatter, but the rupture lives are all
shorter than those noted for tubes not plated with
tellurium. Test environment did not have a detectable
effect on the rupture life. The posttest examination of
these tubes has not been completed, but two of the
tubes tested in fuel salt have been examined metal-
lographically. A’ typical photomicrograph is shown in
Fig. 12.27. Numerous intergranular cracks extend from

“one-third to one-half through the tube wall. This

cracking occurred consistently around the tube.

12.6 CRACKING OF SAMPLES ELECTROPLATED
WITH TELLURIUM

B.McNabb  H. E. McCoy

We have developed a method of coating surfaces with
tellurium by electroplating. The tellurium is dissolved in
hot concentrated nitric acid, evaporated to dryness, and
ammonium hydroxide added to obtain the desired
volume. Platinum gauze is used as the anode, and the
sample to be plated is used as the cathode. The plating
potential used is 24 V dc. Plating current is dependent
on several factors, such as specimen size, anode size,
and distance between the electrodes, but typically it is
about 1 mA on a specimen with a surface area of 6
cm?.

A specimen of vacuum-melted Hastelloy N (heat
2477) was plated with 1 mg/cm? of ‘tellurium under
these conditions. The weight gain was linear with time
at a rate of 0.01 mg cm™2 min~!. After being plated,
the specimen was annealed 65 hr at 650°C in argon,
then bend tested at room temperature. Figure 12.28 is a
photomicrograph of the center of the tension side of
the bend and shows numerous cracks extending to a

maximum depth of about 3 mils and an average of
about 1.5 mils. This demonstrated that tellurium could
cause cracking under these conditions, with a fairly high
concentration of tellurium but short exposure time.

- Approximately 40 sheet specimens were prepared for

plating to determine which alloys were susceptible to

-cracking by tellurium. The materials included (1)

standard and modified Hastelloy N; (2) Hastelloys B, C,
X, and W; (3) Inconels 600, 601, and 718; (4) Incoloy
800; (5) stainless steel types 304, 310, 316, 406, 410,

502, and 17-7 PH; (6) nickel; (7) copper; (8) colum-
- bium and Cb + 1 Zr; (9) Mo—0.5 Ti; and (10) René 62.

These specimens were plated with approximately 0.01
mg/cm? of tellurium (equivalent to about 100 ppm
uniformly distributed throughout a layer 5 mils deep
over the entire surface area). They were then encapsu-
lated in stainless steel and annealed 207 hr at 650°C in
argon. After annealing, they were bend tested at room
temperature to a bend angle of 90°. None of the
standard or modified Hastelloy N specimens showed
any cracking under these conditions. Figure 12.29 is a
photomicrograph of the same heat 2477 that exhibited
cracking at the higher concentration of tellurium (1
mg/cm?) but did not exhibit cracking at 0.01 mg/cm?.

Some materials did crack under these conditions.
Hastelloy W, type 406 stainless steel, and Mo—0.5 Ti
cracked completely through the specimen. Control
specimens with no plating are being prepared for
comparison with these, since it is likely that these
materials may crack with no tellurium present. Speci-
mens are being prepared with higher concentrations of
tellurium and will be annealed for longer times to
determine the threshold concentration that will cause
cracking in Hastelloy N.

12.7 CRACKING OF HASTELLOY N BEING CREEP
- TESTED IN TELLURIUM VAPOR

H.E. McCoy B.McNabb

A sample of Hastelloy N was stressed at 30,000 psi at :

650°C in an environment of argon containing a small
partial pressure of tellurium. The tellurium vapor came
from a small vial of tellurium metal at 550°C.

When the specimen was removed for examination

‘after 900 hr, the quartz vial, which had initially

contained 300 mg Te, had only 75 mg remaining, and
the specimen was coated with fine whiskers of unidenti-

fied material. (We did not collect enough of this

material for identification.) The stressed portion of the
sample had cracks that were visible to the naked eye,
and a metallographic section revealed numerous inter-
granular cracks, with some extending to a depth of 25

unstressed portion of the specimen. The sample had

present in material tested without tellurium present.
Thus this experiment showed that stress seems to
aggravate intergranular cracking in Hastelloy N.

The stress of 30,000 psi used in this test is higher than
would normally be encountered in service, so a test is
being started at a lower stress of 21,500 psi. Tests of
type 304 stainless steel and pure nickel have also been
started to investigate the cracking tendencies of these
materials in a tellurium-containing environment.

12.8 INTERGRANULAR CRACKING OF
MATERIALS EXPOSED TO SULFUR AND
SEVERAL FISSION PRODUCT ELEMENTS

H. E. McCoy

As described in Sect. 6.2, Shaffer et al. developed
techniques for exposing small metal tensile specimens
to vapors of S, Se, I,, Te, and a mixture of As, Cd, and
Sb. These elements have sufficient vapor pressure to
transfer when the tensile samples and small amount of

 

 

134

these elements are sealed together in quartz and placed
in a furnace for annealing at 650°C. The amount of
each element has been small, being enough to result in a
concentration of 100 ppm in the outer 5 mils of
exposed metal surfaces (~0.01 mg/cm?).

The first set of experiments involved only Hastelloy N
samples that were annealed 1000 hr in each environ-
ment. The samples were then strained to failure at
25°C, and sectioned metallographically for viewing.
There were no detectable effects on the mechanical
properties, but numerous intergranular edge cracks were
formed in the sample exposed to .tellurium. The
fracture and the sample edges near the fracture are
shown in Fig. 12.31. However, the statistics on crack
frequency and depth given in Table 12.5 for the first
sample reflect the fact that the cracks were present
throughout the deformed section of the specimen.
Cracks were not formed in the specimens exposed to
the other environments.

In a second experiment, Hastelloy N specimens that
had already been exposed for 1000 hr were exposed to
a new aliquot of the same element for 1000 hr at
650°C. The samples were strained to failure at 25°C.

Again, only the samples exposed to tellurium exhibited
significant intergranular cracking. A photomicrograph
showing a section at the fracture is shown in Fig. 12.32.
The data in Table 12.5 (specimen 5) show that the
additional exposure did not increase the crack fre-
quency but did increase the depth.

650°C was annealed for 1000 hr at 650°C in argon. The
crack depth increased slightly by the additional anneal-
ing (specimen 4, Table 12.5).

One sample was included in the second experiment
that had not been exposed previously and was exposed
to 0.01 mg/cm? of tellurium at 650°C for 1000 hr. It
was strained to failure at 25°C. The crack statistics
(sample 2, Table 12.5) and the metallographic section
(Fig. 12.33) show clearly that the cracking was more
severe than in sample 1, which was exposed to similar
conditions. We have no explanation for this observa-
tion.

A third experiment was run in which samples of
Ni-200 and type 304L stainless steel were exposed to
0.01 mg/cm? each of I,, tellurium, and combinations
of I, and tellurium for 1000 hr at 650°C. Hastelloy N
was exposed to tellurium for 1000 hr in the same
experiments. Only the Hastelloy N sample showed
significant intergranular cracking (sample 3, Table
12.5). The samples of nickel and type 304L stainless
steel - did not crack after exposure to any of the
environments. Photomicrographs of the fractures of
Hastelloy N, nickel, and type 304L stainless steel are
shown in Fig. 12.34,

These experiments demonstrate clearly that tellurium
will cause intergranular cracking in Hastelloy N and that
exposure to Se, S, I, Cd, As, and Sb for up to 2000 hr
does not cause cracking. Type 304L stainless steel and
Ni-200 seem resistant to cracking after exposure to
tellurium for 1000 hr at 650°C.

12.9 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF
HASTELLOY N MODIFIED WITH
SEVERAL ELEMENTS

H. E. McCoy

Several elements are formed as fission products that
may diffuse into the structural metal and alter its
mechanical properties. Sulfur is also of interest because

it is a residual impurity in the salt and may have been

introduced through oil that leaked into the pump bowl.
Alloys have ‘been made with nominal additions of
0.01% of several of these elements, and some test
results have been obtained.

The alloys prepared to date are listed in Table 12.6.

All except alloys 361 and 363 have the composition of
standard Hastelloy N, namely, Ni—16% Mo—7% Cr—4%
Fe—0.5% Mn—0.5% Si—0.05% C. Alloys 361 and 363
did not contain chromium, to determine whether sulfur

and tellurium had different effects whether chromium

‘was or was not present. Ru, Sn, Sb, Te, S, and As have
been added successfully, but Sr, Cd, and Cs have not

been retained in measurable concentrations.

The test program for these alloys is to obtain tensile
data at 25 and 650°C in the solution-annealed con-
dition. The alloys will then be aged for various times at
650°C and some of the testing sequence repeated.
Limited tests have been run to date, and the data are
summarized in Table 12.6. Several trends already seem
obvious.

1. There were variations in the yield stresses of the

solution-annealed alloys at both 25 and 650°C.’

These variations were small and were likely related
to the carbon content rather than the small alloy
addition. (Several of the alloys had only 0.02 to
0.03% C and had lower strength.)

2. The fracture strains at 25°C were quite high for all
alloys. The fracture strains in tensile tests at 650°C
were generally above 25%. Alloys 352, 359, 361,
and 363 had fracture strains slightly below 25%.

3. Several of the alloys had lower stress-rupture proper-
ties than the undoped alloy (351), but the re-
ductions of only a factor of 2 or less were likely due
to the lower carbon concentrations of some alloys.

The alloying additions that show the largest influ-

ences on the mechanical properties are those of group
VI-B — sulfur, selenium, and telturium. These elements

* have been shown to reduce the ductility of nickel in the

temperature range of 500 to 800°C but have no effects
on the properties up to 500°C.!% This pattern is
consistent with that noted with the more complex
alloy, Hastelloy N.

12.10 STATUS OF INTERGRANULAR CRACKING
STUDIES

H. E. McCoy

Several important observations have been made con-
cerning the intergranular cracking of Hastelloy N in the
MSRE. Cracks were visible in many of the samples after
they were removed from the MSRE, but the number
and visible depth of the cracks increased in most
instances with further straining. A heat-exchanger tube
was one notable exception where the number of visible
cracks was about equivalent before and after straining.
The cracking statistics on various components that were
exposed throughout the operation are summarized in
Table 12.7. The surveillance samples that were exposed
for different periods of time in the MSRE core gave
some indication of the time dependence of the cracking
(Table 12.8). The number of cracks increased, but it is
not at all apparent that the depth of cracking increased
with time over the range studied.

Laboratory corrosion experiments in which Hastelloy
N was exposed to fluoride salts thus far have not
reproduced the cracking that” was observed in the
MSRE. Selective intergranular attack has been produced
by making the salt very oxidizing, but the maximum
depth of attack in 3000 hr was 0.5 mil, compared with
several mils in the MSRE.

Experiments in which Hastelloy N specimens were

exposed to low concentrations of vapor of S, Se, Te, I,
As, Sb, and Cd for 1000 or 2000 hr at 650°C and then
strained at 25°C resulted in intergranular cracking only
in those specimens that had been exposed to tellurium
vapor. The cracks in these specimens were similar in

“depth and appearance to those in materials from the
MSRE. Type 304L stainless steel and nickel-200 did not

crack when tested under these same conditions.
Hastelloy N tube-burst specimens and a creep speci-
men that were stressed in the presence of téllurium had
extensive intergranular cracks. Special alloys. of
Hastelloy N that contained small additions of Se, Tc,

Nickel and Nickel Alloys,” Trans. AIME 221, 629 (1961).

Ru, Sn, Sb, Te, S, and As have been prepared and tested

under a variety of conditions. The alloys containing

sulfur and tellurium had reduced rupture lives and
fracture strains at 650°C.

Thus the laboratory tests to date leave no question
that intergranular cracking of the type noted in the
MSRE can be produced by tellurium and possibly by
sulfur. However, the evidence does not seem in hand to
show that the cracking in the MSRE resulted from
tellurium or sulfur. Sulfur is not a fission product but
was introduced by inleakage of oil from the pump
bearings and possibly as a contaminant in the initial salt
charge. The probable amount of sulfur introduced by
oil inleakage was 27 g, and the maximum amount of
sulfur in the initial fuel charge was 24 g, or a total
concentration in the fuel salt of 10 ppm. A similar
concentration of sulfur was present in the coolant
circuit, but no cracking was observed. The coolant loop
was not exposed to as intense radiation as the primary
circuit, and this may have been a factor. However, our
laboratory experiments do not strongly support the
ability of very low concentrations of sulfur to embrittle
Hastelloy N, and we currently discount the possibility
that the cracking is due to sulfur. Our surface chemical
studies on material removed from the MSRE showed
that all fission products with sufficient half-lives to be
detected were present to.shallow depths in the alloy.
Close metallographic examination has shown that many
of the intergranular cracks are present in samples
removed from the MSRE, so the apparent penetration
of the metal by fission products may not represent
much solid-state diffusion along the grain boundaries,
but rather the coating of the surfaces of cracks. The
cracks may be due to the formation of brittle or very
low-melting compounds along the grain boundaries. The

- element responsible for the behavior has not been
"isolated, but a’ rather strong circumstantial case has

developed for its being tellurium. Laboratory experi-

"ments have concentrated on tellurium, but some work

on other fission products is in progress.

On the assumption that tellurium is associated with
the cracking, it is important to speculate about the time
and temperature dependence of the cracking. The
accumulated cracking statistics on samples exposed to
tellurium ‘are summarized in Table 12.9. The various
nuclear experiments vary in the time of exposure and
the concentration of tellurium, so it is impossible to
separate the effects of the two variables. The first three
experiments were for relatively short times, had low

_ tellurium concentrations, and did not show detectable

cracking in the available photomicrographs. The surveil-
lance samples and components from the MSRE were

exposed for various times to different levels of tellu-
rium. The frequency of cracking increases with time
and tellurium content, but the depth of cracking does
not increase detectably. Several samples have been
electroplated and vapor plated with tellurium. One
sample was electroplated with 47 X 10'7 atoms/cm?
and annealed for 65 hr at 650°C. The sample had
numerous cracks after bend testing. Another sample
was electroplated with less tellurium, annealed 200 hr
at 650°C, and did not have any detectable cracks after a
bend test. These two samples show a definite effect of
tellurium - concentration. Several samples have been
vapor plated with tellurium and held at 650°C for. 1000
and 2000 hr. These samples cracked more severely than

143

those from the first group of surveillance samples,
which had been at temperature for 5550 hr but had
only 0.1 X 10!7 atoms of tellurium per square
centimeter. Again, this indicates an effect of concen-
tration. It is impossible to determine the effects of .
temperature from the available data. The temperature
variation in the MSRE was quite small, and other
effects masked any effects of temperature. Thus the
available data offer evidence that tellurium concen-
tration is important but give no indications about the
effects of time and temperature.

The superior resistance of type 304L stainless steel
and Ni-200 offers encouragement that all materials are
not affected adversely by tellurium.

13. Graphite Studies

W. P. Eatherly

INTRODUCTION

The objectives of the MSRP graphite program con-
tinue to be the development of improved radiation-
resistant experimental graphites and the development of
techniques to seal the graphite against '3°Xe. As
indicated in the previous semiannual report,' the
emphasis of the MSRP work has been shifted from the
bulk graphite to the sealing problem. A significant
amount of experimental graphite fabrication is con-
tinuing, however, but it is now largely funded from
other sources and is directed at applications other than
nuclear. Because much of the work is concerned with
relating physical properties to microstructure and such
relations contribute to our understanding of radiation
damage, the results are reported here.

13.1 GRAPHITE DEVELOPMENT
C.R.Kennedy  W.P. Eatherly

The program to fabricate advanced types of graphite
for extended reactor life continued through this report
period. The graphite desired is one having a monolithic
structure with very strong grain boundaries to resist the
shearing deformation caused by irradiation growth. We
are attempting to obtain this structure by the use of
green cokes to reduce or eliminate the binder shrinkage
cracks during fabrication. We have been working exten-

sively ‘with Robinson coke (an air-blown isotropic

coke), Santa Maria coke (a less isotropic coke with
fairly high impurities), and recently with two acicular
cokes: coke A (a very anisotropic coke) and coke SA
(similar to coke A but more isotropic). The thermal-
gravimetric results for these cokes are shown in Fig.
13.1 for comparison. It is readily evident that the
Robinson, Santa Maria, and SA are similar in this regard

"or water wp to’ 10% have no effect on the density of

moldings with nitrobenzene contents from 0 to 8%.
Therefore, we concluded that the densifying effect of
nitrobenzene is in plasticizing the mix and not due to
lubrication effects. Although the data in Fig. 134
indicate that about 8% nitrobenzene gives the maxi-

mum density, other considerations also affect the.

optimum amount. For example, one difficulty in the
use of nitrobenzene is a. strong tendency towards
agglomeration which yields a very large pore size.
During this report period we began to make 3%-in.-
diam blocks of the experimental graphites for evalua-
tion. These blocks are large enough to obtain bend,
electrical resistivity, sonic modulus, x-ray parameters,
metallography, thermal expansion, thermal conduc-
tivity, and HFIR irradiation samples. The testing is still

graphites tested are all very isotropic and do not reflect
the large effects of orientation on the elastic constants.

Over the years we have accumulated bend test results
of a large number of both commercial and experimental
graphites. These results are given in Fig. 13.6 for
comparison to the ORNL graphites. These results are
very informative in classifying the graphites by their
pore morphology. There appear to be two definite
classes of graphites which have a constant strength-to-
modulus ratio, indicating similar pore morphology or
defect structures with like stress intensification. The
highest class is. the Poco and ORNL grades, with

similar. microstructures having a more equiaxial pore

in progress, but some values are available and are listed

in Table 13.1.

“The sonic moduli are shown in Fig. 13.5 as a function
of the accessible porosity. For comparison, the upper
line represents the behavior of Poco graphite as deter-
mined by LASL and confirms the suggestion of
Armstrong? that the modulus is independent of binder.
The comparison of these results with similar data® on
uranium nitride suggests that the decrease in modulus is
simply a geometric effect of increasing porosity. These

materials where the fabrication schedule is known, the
large linear defects are a result of mix agglomeration
into high-density regions. In the others, the micro-
structure revealed evidence of a heavily impregnated
graphite with abnormally large filler particles dispersed
in a mixture of fine particles. Associated with each
large particle was an equally large defect. :

Many of the graphites made by conventional fabrica-
tion are heavily impregnated and appear to retain a
constant strength-to-modulus ratio independent of the
degree of impregnation. This strongly suggests that the
pore morphology is not affected by the impregnant.
However, in several of the Poco grades, impregnation
was attended by significant increases in the strength-to-
modulus ratio, implying an improvement in the reduc-
tion of stress intensity factors. This suggests that the
better ORNL grades could similarly be improved by
impregnation.

The binder carbon in the ORNL graphite cannot be
resolved in the microscope. We do, however, see some
differences in the electrical resistivity due to binder as
well as filler material. The pitch-bindered Robinson
graphite has a lower resistivity than the furan-pitch-
bindered graphites. The Robinson and Santa Maria
fillers appear to be very similar and have a lower
conductivity than the A and SA fillers. It was expected
that Thermax would increase the electric resistivity, as
was observed. The natural flake additions, on the other
hand, were expected to decrease the resistivity; instead
they also resulted in increases. It appears likely that this
increase by natural flake additions is a result of the
poor bindering characteristics of the natural flake.

The Bacon anisotropy factors (BAF) in Table 13.1

show that both the Robinson and Santa Maria graphites
are very isotropic. (The BAF is 1.00 for material having
completely random crystalline orientation.) The SA
filler graphite has some degree of anisotropy, and the A
filler graphite is more anisotropic. Addition of natural
flake intensifies the anisotropy of all of the graphites.

During this report period, samples of ORNL graphites
which had completed one irradiation in the HFIR were
examined and replaced in HFIR for further irradiation.
The observed dimensional changes are shown in Figs.
13.7 and 13.8 for Robinson .and Santa Maria graphites.
The dimensional changes in the Santa Maria grades

show a slight anisotropy, while the Robinson grades

behave very isotropically. Additions of up to 35%
Thermax in either the Robinson or the Santa Maria
graphites have no clearly distinguishable effect.

In summary, the significant ‘points in our graphite
development program during this report. ‘period are as

salient factors which control the quality of green-
coke molded graphites.

2. We have obtained graphites with an unusually high

strength-to-modulus ratio, indicating measurable suc-

cess in optimizing pore morphology.
3. The modulus of elasticity for well-bindered isotropic

~. graphites was found to be porosity dependent and
independent of binder or filler coke.

4. Electrical resistivity was found to be dependent on
both filler and binder. :

5. Both Thermax and natural flake additions reduce
the electrical conductivity.

13.2 PROCUREMENT OF VARIOUS GRADES OF
‘CARBON AND GRAPHITE

W.H.Cook  W.P.Eatherly

We have received a set of rough-machined carbon
materials from Poco Graphite, Inc., which are precur-
sors of their grade AXF, annealed at various tempera-

tures from 1400 to 2500°C. We have also received an .

unmachined block fired to 2500°C, which we have
refired to 3000°C. These provide us with stock for
test specimens of grade AXF precursor materials fired
at 1400, 1800, 2000, 2200, 2500, and 3000°C. We

“shall make the final, finished machining of the test

specimens, characterize them, and integrate them into
our graphite irradiation program.

The purpose in irradiating the AXF precursors is to
supplement the information obtained from irradiation
of a series of carbon-black grades.* For the carbon-
black grades a very sharp decrease in volume occurred
early in the irradiation, which then transformed into a

© slow linear expansion. The expansion rate was un-

affected by the heat-treatment temperature, whereas
the sharp contraction was strongly temperature depen-

dent, ranging from 15% after 1000°C treatment to less’

than 1% at 2400°C and .above. Further, the carbon-
black materials fired at high temperatures showed very

little. damage effect until a fluence of 1.5 X 1022

neutrons/cm? was obtained. The purpose of the present
experiment .is to - determine whether similar -effects
occur in the more stable AXF-type materials.

We have acquired a plate, 1 X 3% X 8% in.

. (nominally), of prade JA-5 manufactured by Airco

Speer Carbon Products. Although it has a bulk density
of only 1.68 gfem?, it is nearly isotropic and has a
special type of filler material which makes it of interest
to our overall irradiation studies. }

133 TEXTURE DETERMINATIONS
0.B.Cavin D.M. Hewette In

The degree of anisotropy is an important parameter in
the development of graphites both at the Y-12 Plant
and at ORNL. We have continued to determine the
x-ray anisotropy of materials made at both installations
and are now extending our capabilities to include an

‘optical technique which can be applied to an area as

small as 10 um in diameter. This will allow us not only

“to determine the anisotropy of the bulk material but

also to independently determine the anisotropy of thin
coatings used for surface sealants.

During this report period a number of graphite
samples were analyzed for the. Y-12 Plant.’ These
samples, all fabricated by molding, ranged from near
isotropic (BAF = 1.04) to highly anisotropic (BAF =
2.01). (A Bacon anisotropy factor of 1.00 indicates
completely random crystalline orientations.) The x-ray
anisotropy of a number of the ORNL materials de-
scribed in Sect. 13.1 has also been determined, and the
values are shown in Table 13.2. Most of these graphites
are close to being isotropic, with BAF values ranging
from 1.003 to 1.125 for samples T-30 and 12-1
respectively. In many instances, we have determined
anisotropy values in the parallel and perpendicular
directions by cutting samples whose axes were parallel
with these directions in the body. The values for the
two directions agree to within experimental error. .

Recently, we obtained a Leitz microscope photo-
meter to be used in determining the optical anisotropy
factor (OPTAF) of graphites of interest in the Gas
Cooled Reactor Program, and its use is now being
extended to include the thin experimental surface

_ sealants being placed on molten-salt graphites.

The reflectivity (r) of materials having a high degree
of crystalline anisotropy (such as graphite). is much

greater when the plane of vibration of a linearly

a axis than when it is parallel with the ¢ axis. The values
of r, and r, have been reported to be 22.5 and 5%
respectively.© A metallographic sample whose surface is
parallel’ with a predominantly a crystallographic direc-
tion will exhibit maxima and minima in ‘the reflected
polarized beam as it is rotated through 360° on the
microscope stage. The ratio of the maximum to the
minimum intensity is then a measure of the optically
measured preferred orientation (OPTAF) of the mate-
rial. ‘An OPTAF of 10 is’ obtained on perfectly
isotropic material.

We have on hand a series of specimens that have been
shown’ to have a relatively large range of preferred
.orientations by OPTAF measurements made at another
laboratory. These samples have been evaluated on our

equipment, and we have obtained a reasonable correla-

tion between our. values and those obtained elsewhere
on the same samples.

It is difficult if not impossible to determine anisot-
ropy of thin coatings with conventional x-ray tech-
niques. Relatively thick coatings are being prepared
from which both x-ray and optical anisotropy values
can be determined to arrive at a correlation between the
techniques. We will then be able to determine not only
the substrate texture but also the local ‘texture that
occurs in the pyrocarbon sealants.

13.4 THERMAL PROPERTY TESTING
J.P.Moore D.L.McElroy T.G.Kollie

Thermal conductivity (A) measurements on an irradi-
ated sample of AXF-5Q graphite were completed in the
range 300 to 800°K (20 to 500° C) using a guarded
longitudinal heat-flow technique. This sample had been
irradiated in HFIR at a nominal temperature of 835°K
(560°C) to a fluence of 2.6 X 10?! neutrons/cm?(E >
50 keV). The A results on this irradiated sample are
compared with values for the unirradiated sample in
Fig. 13.9. Neutron irradiation reduced A at all tempera-
tures, with the ratio of A (irradiated) to A (unirradiated)
_ ranging from 0.25 at 300°K to 0.4 at 800°K. Electrical

resistivity (p) and Seebeck coefficient (s) values were
"obtained during the A measurements and show signifi-
cant increases due to neutron irradiation. The room-
temperature p increased from 1120 to 2300 u€2-cm,
and the room-temperature Seebeck coefficient in-
creased from 2 to 25 uV/deg.

- A second AXF-5Q graphite sample, irradiated to a.
somewhat higher fluence, has been installed in the
apparatus for measurements from 300 to 900°K (20 to
600°C). After irradiation in HFIR at a nominal temper-
ature of 925°K (650°C) to a fluence of 4.2 X 102?!
neutrons/cm® (E > 50 keV), the specimen had a
‘room-temperature p value of 2265 uS2-cm, which is a
preliminary indication that the neutron irradiation
produced changes similar to those cited above.

A second thermal property of considerable engi-
neering and scientific interest is the linear thermal
expansion coefficient. This property is also known to
be sensitive to irradiation. A new apparatus has been
constructed, employing a quartz differential dila-
tometer. The first series of calibration tests has been
completed using a copper specimen. This dilatometer,
shown schematically in Fig. 13.10, is designed to also
measure the temperature dependence of the tempera-
ture coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) to 2%
uncertainty of AXF-5Q and H-337 graphites. Various

aspects of the dilatometer have been interfaced with a

computer-operated data acquisition system (CODAS).
Length changes are measured to 2.5 X 107% cm by an
electronic micrometer and input to CODAS via a BCD
reader. Sample temperature control is provided by
CODAS using a three-action control algorithm which

the data collection rate. Although the first CTE values
must be considered preliminary until the system has
been calibrated with NBS certified thermal expansion
standards of quartz and copper, these initial results
were smooth and encouraging close-to-literature values
for the CTE of copper.

13.5 NOMINAL HELIUM PERMEABILITY
PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS GRADES
OF GRAPHITE

W.H.Cook J.L. Griffith

We have a limited characterization program in pro-

® . gress for some special grades of graphite that are too

anisotropic to have potential value in applications
involving large fast-neutron fluences at 715°C but are of
interest as potential structural and containment mate-

\ ) rials in the chemical processing of the MSBR fuel. Some

of these are liquid-hyrdocarbon-impregnated grades of
graphite that were subsequently heat treated to convert
the hyrdocarbon impregnants to carbon or to graphite.
Table 13.3 is a. summary of some of the helium
permeability parameters for these grades.

Grade 2020 is a fine-grained, unimpregnated material
that has an accessible porosity of 17% and for which
pore entrance diameters are <3 um. Grades 2044 and
1226 are also fine-grained graphite bodies that were
given special surface impregnations with liquid hydro-
carbons and heat treated. This produced a graphitic
impregnation in their pores from Y, through % in.
below their exterior surfaces. The fitst row of data in
Table 13.3 for each of these is from specimens taken
from the core (the unimpregnated zone) of the stock,
and the second row of data for each is for specimens
taken from the impregnated zones.

The unimpregnated core of both grades had approxi-
mately 16% accessible voids. Nominally, 65% of the
accessible voids had pore entrance diameters of 1 to 2
um for grade 2044 and 1 to 3 um for grade 1226.”

The microstructures of the impregnated zones of
grade 2044 indicated a uniform impregnation, but that
for grade 1226 was nonuniform. In the grade 1226
impregnated zone there were tunnels of poorly impreg-

~ nated voids. These were single, exploratory impregna-

tions for each grade, so it is not surprising that the
permeabilities are relatively high for the impregnated
zones. :

Grades Graph-i-tite “G” and “A” are products of a
commercially established process in which the stock has
been impregnated throughout the accessible void
spaces. Graph-i-tite “G” has been fired to graphitizing
temperatures. Graph-i-tite “A” was fired at a lower
temperature and is described as an amorphous carbon-
filled material.

None of the above grades approach the gastightness
of <1078 cm? /sec for helium at STP, required for MSR
core applications. "Additional tests, such -as compati-
bility and pore entrance diameter spectra, should be
made to better evaluate these as structural materials for
the fuel salt processing systems, which do not require
the low gas permeabilities.

be stripped from the fuel salt and prevented from
entering the graphite: moderator. Effective sealing of
graphite surfaces is, therefore, highly desirable. Pyro-
lytic carbon is the desired sealing material because of its
low neutron cross section and its compatibility with the
fuel salts. We have developed two techniques for sealing
with pyrolytic carbon. The first is designed to plug
surface pores with pyrolytic carbon using a vacuum-
pulse impregnation process, and the second is a- macro
coating process in which a continuous layer of pyrolytic
carbon is deposited on the surface of the graphite.
During this report period we did not do any additional
work on the impregnation process other than the
continued examination of previously prepared speci-
mens with the aid of scanning electron microscopy (see
Sect. 13.7).

We continued to fabricate and study the properties of
surface coatings. The furnace that we are using was
described in the last semiannual report. The samples are

of conventional HFIR geometry (see below), but all

sharp corners have been rounded. The samples were
fixed in place in the furnace using an arrangement
shown in Fig. 13.11. The vertical position of the
samples can be adjusted in the center of the furnace,
and the supports are anchored at the top and the
bottom of the reaction tube. This scheme is amenable
to scale-up and changes in sample geometry.

We have conducted coating experiments varying
conditions of gas supply rate, gas mixtures, tempera-
ture, and time. Early experiments were shotgunned i in
order to determine operating ranges that are practical.
In general, the sequence of operation is to heat the

substitute gas (helium) that levitates a quantity of small
carbon beads around the sample. Then a carefully
controlled amount of the gaseous hydrocarbon (C3Hg)
mixed with a diluent gas (helium) is allowed to enter
the reaction chamber, and pyrolysis occurs. After the
designated coating time has elapsed, the coating gas is
replaced with an inert substitute gas, and the sample
temperature is increased to greater-than 1800°C in
order to stress-relieve the coatings. The sample is then
slowly cooled to room temperature.

of the hydrocarbon and a diluent gas are still unre-
solved, but in the lower temperature ranges a large
excess (200% by volume) of diluent gas works very
well, and, of course, as the hydrocarbon supply rate is
decreased the carbon deposition rate also decreases.

Coating time is used to determine coating thickness,
which has ranged from 3 to 7 mils.

lower view shows the response to polarized light.

The physical characteristics of the coating are being
examined, but only partial results are available. The
density of material -deposited at 1150°C was 2.10
g/em®, while material deposited at 1200°C had a
measured density of 2.08 g/cm®. Visual examination of
the samples indicates that the coatings are isotropic, but
at least one sample did respond to polarized light in an
anisotropic manner. The bond between the coating and
the graphite substrate appears to be quite good, and to
some degree the surface pores have been impregnated
with pyrolytic carbon. :

13.7 CHARACTERIZATION OF PYROCARBON
SEALANTS FOR GRAPHITE USING REFLECTED
LIGHT AND SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPES?

W. H. Cook

We have continued our detailed characterization of
graphite sealed with pyrocarbon.? Our objectives are to
learn more about the pyrocarbon sealing techniques and,
in particular, to determine what produces a pyrocarbon

seal that has maximum resistance to damage by fast
neutrons.

The basic specimens being studied are hollow cylin-
ders of pyrocarbon-sealed grade AXF graphite, as
described in the| preceding section. We have been
examining both unirradiated and irradiated specimens
with reflected-light and scanning electron microscopes.
The scanning electron microscope (SEM) is a recently
acquired one'® that has improved resolution. Most of
the specimens that we have examined have been sealed
with a 1,2-butadiene source of pyrocarbon at 700 to
750°C in fluid-bed coaters that were originally designed
to coat uranium oxide or uranium carbide fuel particles
300 to 400 um in diameter. For specimens coated in
this way we found that

1. there is a lack of control and uniformity in the
pyrocarbon sealants,

2. some coatings had cracked during their deposition,

3. sharp corners on the specimens tended to cause
flaws in the pyrocarbon sealing, which acted as crack
propagation centers during irradiation,

4. there is evidence that surface cracks were created or
existing surface cracks enlarged during irradiation.

The evidence for these observations is briefly described
below.

Figure 13.14 is a series of SEM photomicrographs
showing cracking and carbon particle debris in an
unirradiated specimen. In Fig. 13.144 there is a carbon
particle in the center of the photomicrograph with a
family of cracks radiating out from it. Figure 13.14 b,
¢, and d shows the crack and carbon debris at
increasingly greater magnifications. Figure 13.15 is a
transverse fractograph through this specimen. One can
clearly see the base stock graphite (grade AXF) and the
pyrocarbon coating. There is an indication that the

latter may be a duplex type of coating in which the

final deposition was a thin layer of pyrocarbon differ-
ent from the major part deposited i in and on the base
stock. .

A transverse view through two cracks | in the coating is
shown in the reflected light photomicrograph in Fig.
13.16, which is a polished section of the specimen. The
pyrocarbon coating in this region is approximately
0.001 in. thick, and the cracks are almost completely
through the pyrocarbon coating. Barely discernible in
Fig. 13.16 is a thin final pyrocarbon coating over the

"surfaces of the cracks and the main coating. At higher

 

‘magnifications with polarized light or a rotatable

sensitive tint plate, this is resolved and verifies the SEM
indication on this. This thin coating and the cross
section of the carbon debris particle are both weakly
anisotropic, while the bulk of the pyrocarbon coating is
an amorphous, isotropic material. The final thin film
plus the fact that the cracks stopped short of pene-
trating the coating probably accounts for this unirradi-
ated specimen having a relatively low helium per-
meability of 2.9 X 107° cm? /sec.

The nature of cracks in an irradiated specimen was
distinctly different, as can be seen in Fig. 13.17. The
helium permeability of this specimen, which was 4.4 X
1071% cm? /sec in the unirradiated condition, had
increased to 7.2 X 1075 cm? [sec after being exposed to
a fluence of about 1.7 X 10%2 neutrons/cm? (E > 50
keV) at 715°C. Although the cracks are numerous, they
do not appear to completely penetrate the pyrocarbon.
Whether the cracks were created during the irradiation
or are modifications of V-shaped cracks that were in the
pyrocarbon coating prior to the irradiation, the square-
bottom shape of the cracks probably indicates shrink-

age and creep of the pyrocarbon under the fast-neutron

irradiation.

Figure 13.18 illustrates a typical defect in the
pyrocarbon sealant that occurs on the sharp comers of
a specimen, and Fig. 13.185 shows how this type of
fault can be enlarged and propagated under fast-neutron
irradiation. In an attempt to eliminate these faults at
sharp edges, we are now rounding the edges of
specimens prior to sealing them with pyrocarbon.

The other changes that we have made in efforts to
improve the coatings are to change to the furnace

described in Sect. 13.6 and to turn to propene as the
source of the pyrocarbon. (There is evidence that
pyrocarbon from propene has superior resistance to
neutron damage.'!)

A comparison of the pyrocarbons derived from
1,2-butadiene (C4Hg) and propene (C3Hg) is shown in
Fig. 13.19. The 1,2-butadiene was deposited at 700°C
in the fluid-bed fuel-particle coating furnace, and the
propene was deposited in the new furnace at 1200°C.
(It was found, after this specimen was prepared, that
depositing pyrocarbon from propene at 1150°C was
more effective in sealing the base stock, but we expect
that the geometric structure of the pyrocarbon de-
posited from propene at 1150 and 1200°C will be
essentially the same.) Note that the pyrocarbon from
the 1,2-butadiene tends to be in the form of smooth

_ spheroids and ‘that from the propene is in smaller,
- irregular-shaped particles. From both sources, the larger

pyrocarbon particles are usually made up of agglom-

erates of smaller ones; however, this appears to be more
frequently the case for that from the propene.

Because we only recently acquired the capability for
making very sharp SEM pictures of graphite surfaces,
we have not yet examined a specimen, irradiated it, and
then reexamined the same spot. This should provide
more accurate information about the pyrocarbon coat-
ings and the neutron irradiation effects than can be
obtained from the comparison of irradiated specimens
with other unirradiated specimens that we have made to
date.

14.1 DEVELOPMENT OF A TITANIUM-MODIFIED
HASTELLOY N

H.E.McCoy B. McNabb

Our initial work to improve the resistance of Hastel-
loy N to embrittlement by neutron irradiation involved
alloys with titanium additions up to 0.5%.!*2 These
alloys had good postirradiation properties when irradi-
ated at 650°C, but the properties deteriorated rapidly
as the irradiation temperature was increased.® The good
properties were associated with the formation of fine
MC-type carbides and the poor properties with the
formation of coarse M,C-type carbides. Studies of a
series of laboratory melts containing up to 3% Ti
showed that the titanium concentration for optimum
properties was about 2%.* Above this level the brittle
intermetallic Ni; Ti formed, and the ductility de-
creased.’

During this report period, studies of small commercial
melts have confirmed our work with small laboratory
melts. These test results will be described in some
detail.

One necessary experimental modification in our

postirradiation creep program is to measure the strain

that occurs on loading. Since many tests are run above
the yield stress, this strain is often quite large. Experi-
mental techniques have been established to measure this
strain, but the need exists for a method to correct the
strains for tests run before these new techniques were
established. Figure 14.1 was prepared from some of our

latest test results. The stress has been “normalized” by
dividing it by the yield stress of the particular alloy at
650°C. The results seem rather consistent and define a
line that can be used to predict the loading strain on
tests run previously. Some of the results on heat 66-548
presented: in the following figures were corrected by
this correlation.

The test results from the four small commercial melts
described in Table 14.1 will be compared in the next
several figures to show the improvement in properties as
the titanium level is increased. The main element that
varies is titanium, but the variations in carbon level are
also likely significant:

The stress-rupture properties of the modified alloys
and standard vacuum-melted Hastelloy N are compared
in Fig. 14.2. The alloy containing 0.45% Ti has lower
stress-rupture properties than the standard alloy, pri-
marily because of the reduction of molybdenum in the
modified alloys. The two alloys with 1.1% Ti have
improved stress-rupture properties, and the alloy with
2.1% Ti has even better properties. The stress to
produce rupture in 1000 hr varies from 34,000 psi for
the alloy with 0.45% Ti to 53,000 psi for the alloy with
2.1% Ti.

alloys at 650°C.

The creep rates of these same alloys are compared in
Fig. 14.3. The creep strength is about equivalent for the
standard alloy and the alloy modified with 0.45% Ti.
Further increases in titanium increase the creep
strength. The stress to produce a creep rate of

0.001%/hr ranges from 37,000 psi for the alloy with .

0.45% Ti to 55,000 psi for the alloy with 2.1% Ti.
The. fracture strains of the modified alloys are

compared in Fig. 14.4. For rupture lives of about 100

hr the alloys with 1.1 or 2.1% Ti have higher fracture
strains than those of the alloy with 0.45% Ti. However,
for rupture lives in excess of 1000 hr, the fracture
strains appear to be approaching each other.

are shown in Fig. 14.5. The contrast between the curves
for alloy 66-548 (0.45% Ti) irradiated at 650 and at
760°C shows the very important influence of irradia-
tion temperature. The other alloys were not irradiated
over such a large temperature span, and it is not clear
that the variation of irradiation temperature from 700
to 760°C had much of an influence on the properties.
When irradiated at 760°C, the postirradiation. stress-
rupture properties improve in the order of 66-548,
70-785, 67-548, and 70-727.

The postirradiation creep properties of these alloys
are shown in Fig. 14.6. The higher irradiation tempera-
ture has a very detrimental effect on the creep strength

of heat 67-548. The creep strengths after irradiation at.
760°C improve in the order 66-548, 70-785, 675 548,

and 70-727.

The parameter of most importance is the postirradia-
tion fracture strain, shown in Fig. 14.7. Because the
number of points is so small, the lines that have been
drawn are at best only indicators of relative ductility.
The results for alloy 66-548 illustrate the large effect of
irradiating at 650°C compared with 760°C. The maxi-
mum fracture strain observed for alloy 66-548 after
irradiation at 760°C was 0.5%. Alloy 70-785 had
fracture strains in the range of 1 to 4%. Alloy 67-548
had fracture strains in the range of 1 to 4% out to
rupture lives of 100 hr, and then the strains increased to

‘8% in 2000 hr. The behavior of alloy 70-727 is difficult

to define. The data cover a band from 3 to 9% with no
apparent dependence on irradiation temperature or
rupture life.

Although these results are rather limited, we feel that

they support the conclusion that an alloy modified with

2% Ti with adequate resistance to embrittlement can be
developed. Small commercial melts from several ven-
dors are being evaluated.

nominal additions of 0.5% Ti and .2% Nb have excep-
tionally high strength at 650°C. These alloys were small
(50 to 100 Ib) commercial melts that were obtained as
14 -in.-thick plate. The chemical compositions are given
in Table 14.2. Alloys 69-648 and 70-835 were prepared
by one vendor and were double vacuum melted. Alloy
69-344 was prepared by another vendor by the electro-
slag remelt process. The high silicon content of this
alloy resulted from the slag.

The stress-rupture properties at 650°C of the three
alloys are compared with those of standard Hastelloy N
in Fig. 14.8. The allowable stress for a rupture life of
1000 hr ranges up to twice that for standard Hastelloy
N, varying concurrently with the combined concentra-
tions of niobium and titanium in the three alloys. The

* minimum creep rates at 650°C are shown in Fig. 14.9.
The allowable stress for a minimum creep rate of
0.001%/hr ranges to more than twice that for the
standard alloy. The creep strength does not vary in the
same order as the rupture strength.

Very limited creep testing has been done at 704°C,
and the results are presented in Table 14.3, There is a
marked increase in the strength of the modified alloys

At the upper end of the temperature range that we

superiority over standard Hastelloy N is less. Figures
14.10 and 14.11 present the results of creep tests at this
temperature (760°C). Alloys 69-648 and 70-835 have
creep strengths about 25% greater than those of
while the strength of alloy
69-344 is not significantly above that of standard
Hastelloy N.

The increased strength of these alloys seems to result
from a very finely dispersed precipitate. Photomicro-
graphs of alloys 69-648, 70-835, and 69-344 are shown
in Figs. 14.12, 14.13, and 14.14 respectively. The

not been identified, but we suspect that it is basically
an Ni; (Nb,Ti) compound.

Future studies will involve determining (1) the

14.3 WELDABILITY OF COMMERCIAL ALLOYS OF

MODIFIED HASTELLOY N
B.McNabb ~~ H. E. McCoy

Two small commercial heats of modified Hastelloy N°
were procured from the Stellite Division of Cabot
Corporation.- The starting materials were consolidated
as a single vacuum melt of 120 Ib and cast into two
electrodes. One of these was consumable vacuum
remelted (heat 71-114), and the other was electroslag
remelted (71-583). The vendor’s analysis of heat 71-114
in weight percent was 78.1% Ni, 12.03% Mo, 7.2% Cr,
0.06% Fe, 0.01% Mn, 0.05% C, 0.04% Si, 0.12% Al,
1.96% Ti, 0.002% B, 0.002% P, and 0.0055% S. The

S. These heats were received as %-in.-thick plates about
1 ft square. Strips % in. square were sawed from these
plates and swaged into %- and 3%,-in.-diam. welding
wire. The remaining plates were beveled for welding
with a 100° included angle V groove between the plates
to be welded.

The plates were welded to a steel strongback in pairs
for a fully restrained weld. These were then welded,
filling the V groove with weld wire identical to the base
metal in composition. Both sets of plates welded very
well with no cracking during or after welding by visual,
dye penetrant, and x-ray inspection. Heat 71-583
appeared to weld a little more easily, and. the weld
metal flowed slightly better than for heat 71-114.

Side-bend specimens % in. thick were sawed trans-
verse to the welding direction and bent 180° around a
% -in.-radius mandrel. No cracks were evident by visual
or dye-penetrant inspection, as shown in Fig. 14.15.

Some transverse - tensile specimens were - machined
from the weld area with a gage or reduced section (Ys
in. in diameter) containing about half weld and half
heat-affected zone and base metal. Some of these
specimens were creep tested in the as-welded condition
at 650°C and 55,000 psi and some at 760°C and 20,000
psi. Specimens of the base metal of each heat were
tested at the same conditions, and the creep rupture
properties are tabulated in Table 14.4. The rupture life,
minimum creep rate, and fracture strains were reduced
by welding. The lower minimum creep rates for the
welded specimens indicate higher strengths than the
base metal specimens. Table 14.5 is a tabulation of the

tensile properties of these two heats at 25, 650, and
760°C. The yield strengths of the welds were consider-
ably higher at each of these temperatures, the ultimate
strengths were reduced; and the fracture strains re-
duced. The fracture strains probably can be increased
by postweld annealing, and this is being investigated. In
summary, these results confirm our previous observa-
tions that the 2% Ti-modified alloy has good weld-
ability.

observations made on Ni; Ti and strain-induced precipi-
tation in several laboratory and small commercial heats.
Studies are under way to characterize two titanium-
modified and two hafnium-modified heats recently
received from Cabot Corporation. In addition, we have
modified our x-ray diffraction techniques to greatly

improve detectability and precision of phase analyses.

14.4.1 Intermetallic Precipitation in Hastelloy N

As previously reported,® precipitation of the len-
ticular NizTi occurs in small laboratory heats of
Hastelloy N when the titanium’ concentration is ap-
proximately 2% and above. Recently we have observed
this precipitation also in a 1% Ti heat. Although Ni, Ti
precipitation is very profuse and homogeneous in the
2.9% Ti alloy, it nucleates at MC carbides present in the
stacking-fault morphology for lower titanium concen-
trations. (This carbide morphology is obtained during
aging after annealing at 1260°C, rather than the usual
1177°C, and forms around primary MC particles which

are partially dissolved during the anneal.) The. inter-

metallic distribution in alloys containing 2.4 and 0.98%
Ti is shown in Figs. 14.16 and 14.17 respectively. Both
specimens were annealed 1 hr at 1260°C prior to
exposure at 700°C for 1000 and 10,000 hr respectively.

A different morphology of intermetallic precipitation,

shown in Fig. 14.18, was observed in the highest (2.9%)

extend in the same direction [although not necessarily

on (111) planes] as the MC carbides which precipitated
in the stacking-fault morphology.
We have not positively identified these intermetallic

phases but have indications that the fine lenticular

phase is the metastable gamma-prime (y’) Ni; Ti, where-
as the second type is the stable 7-Ni, Ti phase. .

. Examination of a commercial heat of 2.1% Ti-

modified Hastelloy N (70727) revealed precipitation of
a noncarbide phase in a sheetlike morphology (Fig.
14.19). This precipitate appeared to nucleate at grain
boundaries in the gage section of creep samples which

were stressed at elevated. temperatures. It was not

present in unstressed material. Electron diffraction
patterns indicated that it may be eta phase (Ni; Ti); its
morphology is similar to that observed both in the
laboratory heat containing 2.9% Ti and in the stressed
titanium-niobium commercial alloys discussed - pre-
viously. Other studies’ indicate that nucleation of eta
phase is enhanced by deformation. Future studies will
deal with specific identification of intermetallic-phase
precipitates and the relationship between strain-induced
and intermetallic precipitation in the modified alloys.

144.2 Precipitation in New Commercial Alloys

We have examined material from several new
titanium-modified and hafnium-modified commercial
alloys. The titanium-modified heats were prepared both

173

by electroslag remelting and vacuum arc remelting and
‘contained 1.5 to 2.0% Ti. Primary MC carbides (a= 4.30
A) were present in the alloys after solution annealing at
1180°C. Grain-boundary carbide precipitation after
aging 200 hr at 704°C was quite similar to that which
occurred in the Alvac series of alloys®*® with carbides
in irregular grain boundaries and extending into the
matrix 0.5 to 1.0 pm. Fine MC carbides precipitated
around the primary particles in the matrix. Although

most of the primary precipitates were MC carbides,
some appeared to be Ni; Ti. Ni; Ti precipitation during
aging was not observed in the 200-hr specimens. We will
be examining material aged for longer times in the
temperature range of 650 to 760°C.

The hafnium-modified heats contained large quan-
tities of primary carbides. We expect these carbides to
be extremely rich in hafnium, based on the high lattice
‘parameter of these carbides (4.62 A, compared with
464 A for HfC). We have not examined any aged
material by transmission electron microscopy.

14.4.3 Modification of X-Ray Diffraction Techniques

A considerable effort has been expended in the
refinement and modification of x-ray diffraction tech-
niques to improve detectability, resolution, accuracy,
and ease of data interpretation for phase-analysis
studies. We have installed a graphite-crystal-diffracted-
beam monochromator on a Norelco diffractometer
which greatly improves peak resolution and line-to-
background ratios. We -are also using silicon single
crystals, cut so that no diffraction peaks occur, as
substrates for extracted precipitates. As a result, we
have decreased the background by 1.5 to 2 orders of
magnitude. We are now able to detect weak diffraction
peaks not observed previously and can resolve peaks

~ with differences in interplanar spacings down to 0.005
A in the 20- to 254A range. This. capability is
important for detection of carbides with very small
differences in lattice parameters.

goniometer scanning speeds to provide good counting
statistics, and computer processed for ease in data

14.5 SALT CORROSION STUDIES
J. W. Koger

The success of an MSBR is strongly dependent on the
compatibility of the container materials with the

will be oxidized at all surtaces and go into solution until
the increasing corrosion-product, concentration in the
salt comes to “equilibrium” with the alloy at the lowest
temperature point of the loop. Corrosion at the
higher-temperature surfaces continues, however, causing
the salt’s corrosion-product concentration to increase.
As the concentration begins to exceed the equilibrium

concentration at the lower-temperature surfaces, the

molten salts used in the primary and secondary circuits

of the reactor. Because the products of oxidation of
metals by fluoride melts are quite soluble in the
corroding media, passivation is precluded, and the
corrosion rate depends on other factors, including the
thermodynamic driving force of the corrosion re-
actions.!® Design of a practicable system utilizing
molten fluoride salts, therefore, demands the selection
of salt constituents thatjare not appreciably reduced by
available structural metals and alloys whose compo-
nents can be in near thermodynamic equilibrium with
the salt medium.

Nickel-base alloys, more specifically Hastelloy N and
its modifications, are considered the most promising for
use in molten salts and have received most attention. Of
the major constituents of these alloys, chromium is the
least noble and forms the most stable fluoride, so that
corrosive attack is normally manifested by the selective
removal of chromium. Stainless steels, having more
chromium than Hastelloy N, are more susceptible to
corrosion by fluoride melts but can be considered for
some applications. :

Several different oxidizing reactions may occur, de-
pending on the salt composition and impurity content.
Among the most important reactants are UF,, FeF,,
and HF. Reaction of chromium with the latter two
tends to proceed to completion at MSR temperatures;
reaction with UF, to form CrF, and UF; soon reaches
equilibrium in an isothermal system. The equilibrium
constant has a small temperature dependence, however,

which means that a mechanism exists for continued

attack in nonisothermal systems. Corrosion by molten
salt under a temperature gradient involves material
removal from hot surfaces and material deposition on
cold surfaces, with a steady-state amount of corrosion
products remaining in the salt. This phenomenon, called

temperature gradient mass transfer, proceeds in the

following manner. At the beginning of operation of a
temperature-gradient system, the least-noble constit-

uent of the container alloy (chromium in our case)

10. W. R. Grimes, “Molten-Salt Reactor Chemistry,” Nucl.
Appl. Technol. 8,137 (1970).

metal begins to deposit there. The rise in corrosion-
product concentration in the circulating salt will con-
tinue until the rate at which metal is returning to the
walls at low temperatures balances the rate at which it
is entering the salt in the hot-leg regions. Thereafter,
there is continuing removal and deposition with no
overall change in corrosion-product concentration in
the salt. At steady state the rate of corrosion is
generally limited by. the rate of diffusion of the
chromium through the alloy to the hot surface where it
is being removed.

Corrosion by temperature-gradient mass transfer in-

volving selective removal of chromium occurs in all of

our nonisothermal systems. Under abnormally oxidizing
conditions (as in fluoroborate systems containing
water) most constituents of Hastelloy N may be
removed.

The experiments discussed in this section were con-
ducted primarily to determine quantitatively the
amounts of corrosion in various salt-alloy systems
designed and operated to show the effects of variables
such as alloy constituents, temperature, salt impurities,
salt velocities, and exposure times. These experiments
are operated under design parameters based on the
molten salt breeder reactor, primarily in nine thermal-
convection loops which provide nonisothermal, dyna-
mic conditions. Eight of the loops are constructed of
Hastelloy N, one of stainless steel. The salts of interest
either are LiF-BeF,-based with UF, (fuel),
ThE, (blanket), or ThF4 and UF, (fertile-fissile), or are
an NaBF,-NaF mixture (coolant salt). Pumped loops
containing NaBF,-NaF are covered separately (Sect.
14.6).

The status of the thermal-convection loops in opera-
tion at the end of this period is summarized in Table
14.6.

"ThF4 (70-23-5-1-1 mole %) salt and air at temperatures
from 560 to 700°C are under way. It is evident from
the examinations that temperature gradient mass trans-
fer did occur. Attack in the hot section was manifested
by formation of voids having a maximum depth. of
about 4 mils. Deposits less than 1 mil thick were noted:
in the cold regions. The actual void formation and
chromium depletion agreed favorably with those pre-
dicted from calculations based on the rate of chromium
diffusion. No differences in corrosion were seen for
standard Hastelloy N, modified Hastelloy N, and
welded areas. Figure 14.20 shows typical attack in each
of the above materials. Where exposed to air, the
materials formed two-layer oxide having a maximum
thickness of about 2 mils. Over all, Hastelloy N is quite
suitable for long-term use as a container material for a
molten salt of the type used in this test and has
acceptable air oxidation resistance at the temperatures
tested. )

Loop 1258, constructed of type 304L stainless steel,
has operated 8.5 years with the same salt as loop 1255.
The maximum corrosion rate over the last 8395 hr was
1.0 mil/year. The chromium content of the salt is 580

‘ppm, an increase of about 500 ppm during operation.

The loop continues to operate satisfactorily.

NCL-21 is a Hastelloy N thermal-convection loop,
with removable Hastelloy N specimens in each leg,
containing salt of the same composition as the MSRE
fuel. As discussed in some detail in Sect. 10.1, this loop
is equipped with electrochemical probes to measure the
U3*/U* ratio. Such probes had been used successfully
in small static systems; but this experiment is designed
to evaluate their possible use for on-stream analysis in a
large system.

The specimens from NCL-21 were removed, weighed,

-and examined three times. Weight losses and gains, as

expected in a temperature-gradient mass transfer sys-
tem, were seen in the hot and cold legs respectively.

The maximum weight loss in the hot-leg specimens after

4193 hr was 0.23 mg/cm?, which corresponds to a
corrosion rate of 0.02 mil/year, assuming uniform

material removal. The chromium content of the salt has
increased 40 ppm. The U3*/U* ratio gradually in-
creased with time between specimen insertions. This
presumably reflects the corrosion reaction of UF, with
chromium, and we are correlating these ratios with our

weight-change data. As indicated in Sect. 10.1, on at
least two of the three occasions when specimens were’

inserted, some oxidant appeared to be introduced, as
indicated by a decrease in the U*/U* ratio. After these
initial measurements, further steps will involve addi-
tions of oxidants and reductants to study their in-
fluence on the measurements of the U*? Un ratio and
the corrosion rate.

14.5.2 Fertile-Fissile Salt

A fertile-fissile MSBR salt has circulated for over
17,000 hr in Hastelloy N loop NCL-19A, which has -

removable specimens ‘in each leg. The test has two

purposes: (1) to confirm the compatibility of Hastelloy

N with the salt and (2) to determine if bismuth will be
picked up by the salt and carried through the loop. The
bismuth is contained in a molybdenum vessel located in
an appendage beneath the hot leg of the loop. Assuming
uniform loss the maximum weight loss has been
quivalent to only 0.02 mil/year. A modified Hastelloy
N alloy (Ni—13.0% Mo—8.5% Cr—0.1% Fe—0.8% Ti—
1.6% Nb) has lost less weight than a standard alloy at
the same position. We attribute this difference to the
low iron in the modified alloy, compared with about
5% in the standard alloy. Principal corrosion reactions
in this loop appear to be

2UF,(d) + Cr(s) & 2UF;(d) + CrF, (d)
and
FeF, (d) + Cr(s) 2 Fe(s) + CrF, (d),

where s and d refer to crystalline solid and dissolved
states respectively. The chromium content of the salt
has increased 178 ppm:in 15,000 hr, and there is no
detectable bismuth in the salt. During the last exposure
period, the specimens in the hot leg were inadvertently
placed 4 in. lower than usual. This put the specimen at

. the bottom of the stringer into the molten bismuth. On

removing the stringer, this bottom specimen was miss-
ing. The end of the stringer appeared to have been in
contact with the bismuth but was not dissolved. Thus it

is likely that the very small specimen pins dissolved -

during the run, and the specimen fell off the stringer.
The bismuth in contact with the salt seems to have had

"no effect on our mass-transfer results.

14.5.3 Blanket Salt

Loop NCL-15-A, constructed of standard Hastelloy N
and containing removable specimens in each leg, has
operated over three years with the LiF-BeF,-ThF,
blanket salt proposed for a two-fluid MSBR. Mass

‘transfer, as measured by the change of chromium

concentration in the salt, has been very small. The
previously reported “glaze” or coating (probably a
high-melting thorium compound) on specimen surfaces
has now disappeared, and significant weight changes are
measurable. The maximum corrosion rate of 0.06
mil/year (assuming uniform removal) is quite acceptable
for an MSBR.

14.5.4 Coolant Salt

Loops NCL-13A and NCL-14, constructed of stan-
dard Hastelloy N and containing removable specimens

“in each leg, have operated for 3.3 and 4.3 years,

respectively, with the fluoroborate mixture NaBF4-NaF
(92-8 mole %). The maximum corrosion rate (assuming
uniform removal) at the highest temperature, 605°C,
has averaged 0.7 mil/year for both loops. Corrosion has
generally been selective toward chromium by the
reaction

FeF,(d) + Cr(s) 2 CtF, (d) + Fe(s).

However, there have been short periods when gaseous
impurities entered the salt to cause general attack of the

Hastelloy N, for example, by the reaction

2HF(d) + M(s) Z H,(g) + MF, (d),

where d, s, and g refer to. dissolved state, crystalline
solid, and gas, respectively, and M may be Cr, Fe, Ni, or
Mo. These periods resulted from leaks in the gas lines or
in ball-valve seals. The valves are exposed to a mixture
of helium and boron trifluoride gas and not to salt. We
attribute the leaks of the ball valves to corrosion
induced by air and moisture inleakage from lines into
the gas mixture. Although the overall corrosion rates in
these loops are not excessive, the rates observed in the
absence of leaks have been an order of magnitude lower
than the average rate. In NCL-13A the maximum
corrosion rate has been 0.3 mil/year over the last 3170

- hr.

Loop NCL-17, constructed of standard Hastelloy N
and containing removable specimens. in each leg, is
being used to determine the effect of steam on the
mass-transfer characteristics of the fluoroborate salt
mixture. After 1000 hr of normal operation, steam was

 
 

 

178

injected into the salt.!? The loop has now operated
22,400 hr following that injection. There was a large
increase in weight change during the first 239 hr after
steam injection, and another abrupt change in the rate
of weight change occurred at 10,178 hr because of a
leak in the cover gas system; however, the overall
mass-transfer rate decreased steadily between these two
events.

Specimens were recently removed after 7000 hr of
continuous exposure, and the average corrosion rate at
the maximum temperature, assuming uniform dissolu-
tion, was 0.7 mil/year. The rate is equal to that seen in
the loop before a leak in the cover gas system that was
noted after 10,178 hr exposure. Once again the
corrosion rate does appear to be decreasing.

Loop NCL-20, constructed of standard Hastelloy N
and containing removable specimens in each leg, has
operated for over 14,900 hr with the fluoroborate
coolant salt at the extreme temperature conditions
considered for the MSBR secondary circuit (687°C max
and 438°C min ). Forced-air cooling of the cold leg is

required to obtain this AT. For the first 11,900 hr
operation, the maximum corrosion rate was 0.2
milfyear. Then a regulator failure allowed some mois-
ture leakage into the loop and increased the maximum
corrosion rate to 0.7 mil/year. During the last 4797 hr,
this rate (assuming uniform loss) was 0.4 mil/year and
decreasing. Co :

An experiment designed to evaluate the corrosion
properties of eight brazes for Hastelloy N in NaBF,-
NaF (92-8 mole %) at 607°C for 4776 hr was
conducted. The test was isothermal and utilized samples
of the lapjoint geometry. The brazes included Au-Ni,
Ag-Cu, Cu, and several types of Ni-Cr-Fe alloys. Over
the whole test, all specimens gained weight. Figure
14.21 shows specimens before and after the test. The
difference in appearance is attributable to deposits on
the surface of the Hastelloy N. However, during two
time periods, some ‘weight losses were evidenced,
indicating highly corrosive conditions in the melt. On
the basis of these weight losses and metallographic
observations, we tentatively ranked the brazes accord-
ing to corrosion resistance, and the Cu and Ag-Cu
appear to be the best. To further aid us in our
evaluation, we are using the microprobe to determine

146 F ORCED-CONVECT ION LOOP
CORROSION STUDIES

W.R. Huntley J. W. Koger

Operation of forced-convection loop MSR-FCL-1A
continued during the past six months, providing infor-
mation on the compatibility of standard Hastelloy N
with NaBF,4-NaF (92-8 mole %) coolant salt at tempera-
tures similar to those expected in the MSBR secondary
circuit. Maximum and minimum salt temperatures in
the loop are 620 and 454°C (1150 and 850°F).
Hastelloy N corrosion test specimens are exposed to the
circulating salt at 620, 548, and 454°C and a nominal
velocity of 5%, fps. In this loop, the tubing must be cut
to remove the specimens, and welding is required for
specimen replacement.

A second forced-circulation loop of improved design,

'MSR-FCL-2, also operated throughout this report
period. This loop is also of standard Hastelloy N and
circulates sodium fluoroborate at 454 to 620°C. Veloci-

ties are much higher, however, nominally 10 and 20 fps
in the test sections. Three sets of corrosion specimens
are exposed to salt at 620, 537, and 454°C. The FCL-2
design permits these specimens to be easily removed
and inserted, with a minimum of contamination of the

loop.

14.6.1 Operation of Loop MSR-FCL-1A

Loop MSR-FCL-1A, which started in August 1971,
operated throughout this report period except for a
six-week scheduled shutdown for examination of corro-
sion specimens after 2000 hr of loop operation. Normal
loop operation was resumed and by the end of the
period had reached a total of 3700 hr at design
conditions.

Following established practice, during the shutdown

the LFB pump bearings and oil seals were replaced. -

During cold shakedown, several seal failures occurred.
Because of these problems the specified flatness of the
seals was increased, a new pump assembly procedure

was . prepared incorporating additional inspection and

cleaning steps, and other changes were made to improve
the reliability of operation.

14.6.2 Results from Loop MSR-FCL-1A

When the specimens from the three points in the loop
were weighed after about 2000 hr of loop operation, all

179

were found to have lost weight. Amounts ranged from
—2 mg/cm? for the lowest-temperature (454°C) speci-
mens to —19 mg/cm? for those at the highest tempera-
ture (620°C). The corrosion rate at the highest tempera-
ture was approximately 4 mils/year. This contrasts with
the pattern of moderate - temperature-gradient mass
transfer (the FCL-2 results, for example), in which
weight losses occur in the hot sections accompanied by
weight gains in the cooler sections and increases in
corrosion products in the salt: Analyses of salt samples
taken from the loop during the interval indicate little
overall ‘change in nickel and molybdenum and an
increase of about 150 ppm in chromium, with a
decrease in the concentration of iron in the salt.

The salt analyses indicate that there was at least a
small amount of rapid, general corrosion at the very
beginning of loop operation. Results of a sample taken
90 hr after the new loop was first filled (during which
time the salt circulated isothermally at 540°C) indi- .

_cated that chromium, iron, and molybdenum concen-

trations in the salt had all increased sharply. Chromium
had jumped from 36 to 275 ppm; iron had gone from

350 to 472 ppm; molybdenum, which is presumed to

have been around 10 ppm or less in the salt at the
beginning, was now 175 ppm. Nickel in the salt had not
changed appreciably.

* Analyses of ‘subsequent salt samples for corrosion
products indicate that during 1984 hr of operation at
design conditions prior to the removal of the specimens,
chromium came down and leveled off at around 200
ppm, iron decreased (rapidly at first then more slowly)
to about.25 ppm, and molybdenum quickly fell to less
than 10 ppm. Oxygen analyses indicated an upward

- trend, from about 500 ppm to approximately 1000

ppm. The concentration of hydrogen as BF3OH™ was
indicated by infrared analyses to be 63 ppm in the
sample at the beginning of design operation and 26 to
30 ppm in the four samples taken between 222 and
1984 hr.

It appears that when the salt was first circulated in

‘the new loop, there was rapid, general attack which

removed not only chromium but also iron and moly-
bdenum (and probably nickel) from all portions of the
loop. Subsequent mass transfer removed more material
from hot surfaces and deposited material on cold
surfaces, producing the spread from —2 to —19 mg/cm?
observed on the metal specimens.

Salt sample analyses during operation at design

conditions after the specimens were removed and
replaced gave no indication of abnormally corrosive
conditions.

 
 

14.6.3 Operation of Loop MSR-FCL-2

Corrosion loop MSR-FCL-2 began routine operation
on September 1, 1971, and during this report period
accumulated. about 3900 hr at design conditions. The
salt has not been drained from the piping system since
the initial fill. No serious operational problems were
encountered, but six unscheduled, automatic shut-

~ downs occurred during the six months. The automated

protective circuits functioned as planned on .each

occasion to stop the salt pump and cooler blowers and
“to place the loop in an isothermal “standby” condition.
"This safety action was necessitated twice by a low flow

alarm on the lubrication oil, once by a temporary
electric power outage, once by a brush failure on the
Adjustospede motor that drives the salt pump, once by
a brush wire failure on the pump motor, and once by a

* failure of a vacuum tube in the pump speed control.

After each of these incidents, normal operation was
resumed following a few hours delay.

On several occasions, severe electrical noise appeared

on some of the sheathed insulated-junction loop ther-
mocouples. The cause was found to be arcing of the slip
rings on the clutch of the pump motor and was
eliminated by honing the slip rings.

The design of the corrosion specimen removal sta-
tions, which permits rapid removal of each of the three
stringers via a salt freeze valve, proved to be very
effective during the five scheduled shutdowns in which
the specimens were removed. Downtime for specimen
removal and examination was only two days, compared
with several weeks and much more manpower in
MSR-FCL-1A.

The performance of the ALPHA salt pump in
MSR-FCL-2 and a description of proposed engineering
improvements to the pump are described in Sect. 3.5.2
of this report. :

14.6.4 Results from Loop MSR-FCL-2

The specimens were weighed after 450, 914, 1780,
2774, and 3846 hr of routine operation at design
conditions. Cumulative weight changes subsequent to
the beginning of design operation are shown in Fig.
14.22. (Changes during 500 hr of startup testing,'?
which ranged from +0.9 to —1.5 mg/cm?, are not

_ included.) Each point is the average for more than one

temperature-gradient mass transfer at a steadily de-
creasing rate, with a significant velocity effect. Speci-
mens in the hottest position have remained fairly
bright, with the specimens in the middle temperature
position darker and the specimens in the coldest
position darkest. Differences in appearance such as
these have been previously observed.!*
Corrosion-product concentrations in the salt showed
no anomalous behavior, either during the startup or in
subsequent operation. As shown in Fig. 14.23 the
chromium concentration increased by about 60 ppm
during the startup period, rose another 70 ppm or so
during the first few hundred hours of routine operation,
and thereafter changed very little. The iron concentra-
tion decreased. Molybdenum and nickel remained low.
In sets of specimens exposed at the same temperature
to the same superficial salt velocity, the upstream

" specimen generally showed the greatest weight change,

the second specimen in line showed less, and the
downstream specimen showed the least. The differences
(on the order of 10% between the first and last

specimen) were dear early in the operation, when

weight changes were relatively large, but become
practically indistinguishable later, when all weight
changes approached the limits of precision of measure-
ment. Changes of this nature are quite common in
liquid metal systems (“downstream” effect) and are due
to a concentration gradient driving-force effect between
the wall and the fluid. Turbulence may also be
responsible for the changes.

42 Assuming uniform material removal of all constituents.

The dependence of the rates of weight change on time
and velocity that is evident in Fig. 14.22 is revealed
more sharply in Table 14.7, which shows weight losses
of the high-temperature specimens from one measure-
ment to the next. For the sake of comparison with
other corrosion data, the weight losses are also ex-
pressed as an equivalent corrosion raté during the
interval. For specimens having a weight loss, the effect
of the velocity was to the 0.5 power. The corrosion
rates of the hottest specimens are approaching the same
values, which is an indication that the controlling
mechanism of corrosion has now changed from a

solution rate control to the velocity-independent solid-
state chromium diffusion control.

Experience indicates that corrosion in fluoroborate
systems is due largely to impurities, particularly water.
Reactions that are believed to be involved include the
following. [Although chromium is the most readily
oxidized constituent of Hastelloy N, reactions similar to
(3) involving other constituents can be important if the

concentration of HF is high.]

Thus both the NaBF;O0H initially in the salt and any

H, 0 that may be admitted later result in corrosion and .

the appearance of hydrogen, which can diffuse through
the hot metal walls and be lost from the system.
Removal of hydrogen from the system by diffusion
through the metal would drive reaction (4) and (5) to
the right. The results'® of the tritium addition to
NCL-13A supported the contention that little if any
- hydrogen-containing impurities existed in the molten
fluoroborate. Because of the connection with corrosion

(and, as discussed below, with tritium transport),
samples of salt from FCL-2 were routinely analyzed for
oxygen and for BF;OH". (The infrared-absorption
technique for the latter analysis is discussed in Sect. 7.6
and 10.7 of this report.) The oxygen results shown in
Fig. 14.23 do not reveal any trend with time. The
measured concentrations of hydrogen as BF;0H™, on
the other hand, clearly indicate a downward trend for

“about 2800 hr, then little change over the next 1000 hr.

The hydrogen behavior in the fluoroborate salt in
FCL-2 is of great interest because of its implications for

tritium transport in an MSBR. The concentrations .

shown in Fig. 14.23 indicate a much less rapid loss of

“hydrogen than would be expected on the basis of the

interrelations of BF3;OH” concentration, hydrogen
pressure, and diffusion through Hastelloy N observed in
other experiments (Chap. 7 of this report).

show very low generalized corrosion rates of less than
0.25 mil/year, assuming uniform corrosion. The actual
weight gains for standard Hastelloy N, both air melted

and vacuum melted, were about 0.43 mg/cm? for.

11,000 hr exposure to steam at 538°C and about 3.45
mg/cm? for 15,312 hr exposure to steam at 593°C.
Figure 14.24 compares the weight changes of Hastelloy
N with those of the 2%% Cr steel that is commonly
used in modern power plants. There was no evidence of
spalling on any of the specimens.

Although the results are not shown in Fig. 14.24,
several modified Hastelloy N specimens are also. in-
cluded in the facility at 538°C. The weight changes
were slightly higher than those for the standard alloy,
but none of the modified specimens had weight gains
greater than 0.7 mg/cm? after 11,000 hr exposure to
steam at 538°C.

Some of the specimens were removed for detailed
examination after 10,000 hr exposure. Table 14.8
shows the compositions of these alloys. Metallographic
examination showed standard air-melted Hastelloy N
(heat 5065) to have some small nodules of oxides.
Figure 14.25 shows one of the deepest nodules, having
a penetration of about 0.4 mil. The oxide is generally

 

183

very thin and adherent, with occasional patches of

oxide penetration.

‘The vacuum-melted heat of standard Hastelloy N

“(heat 2477) also had a very thin, adherent oxide, but

. the oxide nodules were more frequent and deeper (0.8

mil) than for the air-melted heat 5065. Figure 14.26 is a
photomicrograph of one of the worst areas in the
vacuum-melted alloy and shows the thin, adherent
oxide in some areas and the maximum penetrations in
other areas. The lower manganese and silicon (~0.05 wt
% each) in the vacuum-melted heat probably account
for its slightly lower corrosion resistance.

One of the modified Hastelloy N heats, 21546, with
low Fe, Mn, and Si (Table 14.8) had weight gains of
about 0.44 mg/cm®. However, the grain boundary
penetrations were about 10 mils deep in some ‘areas.
Figure 14.27 shows one area with a thin, adherent
oxide at the surface and one of the deep grain boundary
penetrations. Microprobe "analysis indicates the outer
surface of the grain boundary penetration to be slightly
enriched in iron. The grain boundary penetrations
appear to be slightly enriched in chromium, slightly
depleted in nickel, and little different in the mo--
lybdenum concentration.

A specimen of a modified alloy containing 2.1%
titanium (heat 70-727) was removed after 7330 hr at
538°C. Figure 14.28 shows the thin, adherent oxide
with metallic-appearing particles above the surface.
Microprobe analysis indicated that these were enriched
in iron, and, as previously reported, it appears that iron
oxide particles are entrained in the steam® ® and stick to
the surface of specimens. The 2.1% titanium content of
this heat. appears to stabilize the grain boundaries and
prevent the penetrations observed in heat 21546.

The heat 5065 specimen gained 0.33 mg/cm?, heat
2466 gained 0.26 mg/cm? , and heat 21546 gained 0.44
mg/cm?, all in 10,000 hr at 538°C. In 7330 hr at
538°C, heat 70-727 gained 0.37 mg/cm?. The corrosion
was uniform in some specimens, and the weight changes
are indicative of the depth of attack. In other specimens
the corrosion was not uniform, and the weight changes
do not indicate the depth of attack.

There appears to be an effect of surface preparation

“on the weight gain of standard Hastelloy N in steam.

Figure 14.29 is a plot of weight gain time for heat 5065
specimens with several surface preparations. All
material was rolled to 0.035-in. sheet, with intermediate
anneals at 871°C and a final anneal of 1 hr at 1180°C.
Specimens 9 and 10 were exposed in this condition,
specimens 11 and 12 were surface abraded with 400-grit
paper, and specimens 13 and 14 were electropolished.
The surface-abraded specimens have the highest weight

. gains, -as-received (rolled) specimens lower, and the

electropolished specimens the lowest weight gains.
There are several possible reasons for the observed
effect. One is simply the differences in actual surface

areas. The abraded specimens would have the greatest’

surface area, the as-rolled specimens next, and the
electropolished specimens the least surface area. The
surface area was calculated from micrometer measure-
ments and would not represent the’ true surface areas.
Greater surface roughness would also give more sites for
particles of oxides entrained in the steam to stick, with

ot This increased surface area would also provide added

sites” for oxide nucleation on the metal. These speci-
mens are continuing in the facility to see if these trends

‘continue to larger weight gains.

In addition to the unstressed specimens described
above, the Bull Run facility also contains stressed
tubular specimens. Stresses are maintained by having
plant steam inside the tubes and a low-pressure annulus

"around them. When first installed, this facility included

four tubes with capillary connections to sense leakage
into the annuli.!? During this report period, in order to
increase the rate of accumulation, four additional

‘tube-burst specimens were installed in the facility

without the capillary tubing extending outside the
chamber to indicate rupture. Internal diametral strains
will be measured periodically, and rupture times will be
estimated by comparison with the instrumented tests.
The specimen design is identical to the other double-
wall tube-burst specimens, except that the annulus
between the tubes is not connected to the outside of
the chamber by capillary tubing for indication of

failure.

N25101 have 4000 hr exposure at 56,000 and 50,000
psi with diametral strains of 0.57 and 0.33% respec-
tively. Heat N25101 thus appears stronger than N25095
under these creep conditions, although the certified
tensile properties were equivalent. The four new speci-
mens were heat N15095. The specimens with the
highest stress (58,000 psi) failed sometime during the
first 1000 hr of exposure. A small crack developed in
the inner tube and pressurized the annulus between the
tubes. When the plant steam pressure was reduced, the
pressure in the annular region collapsed the tube, as
shown in Fig. 14.30. The specimen had a hairline crack
extending almost the entire length of the reduced
section of the tube wall. Numerous cracks formed on
the OD and the ID.

Plant records at the Bull Run plant have been
examined in an effort to determine the time of failure
more closely. Failure could have occurred on February
20, when a pressure excursion to 3750 psig momen-
tarily occurred and, subsequently, the pressure dropped
to zero in about 30 min. This 3750 psig would have
been 62,000 psi on the specimen. This would have
meant that the failure occurred after 792 hr. As shown
in Fig. 14.31 numerous intergranular cracks were
formed in the failed sample.

The other three new specimens after 1000 hr of
exposure have diametral strains of 0.25% at 53,000 psi,
0.24% at 42,502 psi, and 0.14% at 42,400 psi.

14.8 EVALUATION OF DUPLEX TUBING FOR USE
IN STEAM GENERATORS

B.McNabb  H. E.McCoy

One type of duplex tubing. proposed for steam
generators is nickel 280 (Ni + 0.05% Al) on the outside
for salt corrosion resistance and Incoloy 800 (Fe—34%
Ni—21% Cr) on the inside for resistance to steam
corrosion. Some mechanical property tests on a 10-ft
length supplied by the International Nickel Company
were reported previously.'® Tube-burst tests at 538°C,
in an argon atmosphere with argon internal pressure,
continued during this report period. One specimen,
with a pressure corresponding to a stress of 46,000 psi
on the Incoloy 800 (or 28,720 on the entire wall),
ruptured at 3263 hr with a diametral strain of 3.04%.
The nickel 280 exterior was cracked profusely. A
tube-burst specimen was stressed at 40,000 psi on the
Incoloy 800 and was discontinued at 7075 hr with a
diametral strain of 1.14%. Figure 14.32 is a photograph
of this specimen with dye penetrant applied to delin-
eate the cracks in the nickel 280 exterior. It did not
crack as extensively as the higher-stressed specimen, but
it was discontinued before rupture or equivalent dia-
metral strains were reached. Figure 14.33 shows photo-
micrographs of a typical cross section and shows the
extensive cracking in the nickel 280. It is evident that
cracking does occur in this nickel 280 at relatively low
strains.

The base properties of nickel 280 sheet look quite
good. This test material was 0.06 in. thick and had been
heavily worked. Figure 14.34 shows several creep curves -
for nickel 280 sheet at 538°C in argon. There appears
to be no clear-cut effect of rolling direction on creep
properties, as the longitudinal specimens had longer
rupture times at the two higher stresses and the
transverse specimen had a longer rupture life at 15,000
psi. All of the sheet specimens tested had rupture
strains greater than 20%, indicating much greater
ductility than that shown by the nickel 280 on the
duplex tubing. Thus it appears likely that the duplex
tubing can be produced with a nickel layer that has
good ductility. The International Nickel Company is
preparing another length of Incoloy 800—nickel 280
duplex tubing for further testing and evaluation.

 
 

 

 

 

15. Support for Chemical Processing

J. R. DiStefano

A reductive-extraction process for protactinium isola-
“tion and a metal transfer process for rare-earth removal

are being developed for molten-salt breeder reactors,

and this chapter deals with the materials development
in support of these chemical processes. A principal
requirement of materials for this application is compati-
bility with molten Bi-Li-Th solutions at 500 to 700°C.

Molybdenum appears quite promising, and currently
our efforts are concentrated on the fabrication of a
reductive-extraction test stand of molybdenum. Al-
though compatible with bismuth-lithium solutions and
molten-salt mixtures, molybdenum is difficult to weld
and, therefore, to fabricate into complex equipment.
This test stand, probably the most difficult all-
molybdenum system ever attempted, has involved the
development of many fabrication procedures not pre-

viously used on this material, such as back extrusion, -

orbiting arc welding, and roll bonding. With this unit we
will obtain metallurgical data on the test equipment and
chemical engineering process data under a variety of
conditions.

In addition, we are continuing our program to
evaluate the compatibility of molybdenum, TZM, tanta-
lum, T-111, Ta—10% W, brazing alloys, and various
grades of graphite with bismuth-lithium solutions under
reprocessing conditions.

15.1 CONSTRUCTION OF A MOLYBDENUM
REDUCTIVE-EXTRACTION TEST STAND

J. R. DiStefano - A. J. Moorhead

We are constructing a molybdenum test stand for
metallurgical and chemical engineering evaluation. It
consists of a S-ft-long, 1%4-in.-OD packed column and
associated pots and piping through which molten salt
and bismuth will circulate in the temperature range 550

to 650°C. Details of the design of this test stand have -

been reported previously.!*?> Construction involves (1)
fabrication of containers and column, (2) machining of

192

subassembly components, (3) construction of an un-
joined mockup from test stand components, (4) fabrica-
tion of head pot and column subassemblies, and (5)
interconnection of the subassemblies to complete the
test stand.

Items 1 and 2 above have been completed. All sizes of
tubing (%, %., %, and % in. OD) have been obtained
‘and inspected by fluorescent-dye-penetrant and ultra-
sonic techniques. Using the fullsize wood-aluminum-
steel test-stand mockup (Fig. 15.1) as a guide, we have
selected the specific tubes to be used in fabrication.

Previously, we reported brittle behavior of the %,- and
%-in.-OD tubing at room temperature.> We traced this
behavior to the presence of a brittle layer on the inner
surface and found that the tubing could be made
ductile by removal of 0.001 to 0.002 in. from the wall.
To accomplish this, the bore of the Y-in.-OD tubing
was etched at ORNL. However, more %-in.-diam tubing
was needed than was on hand. Therefore, we returned
50 ft of three different heats of %-in.-diam tubing to
the vendor and purchased 100 ft of a single heat
produced according to specifications that ensured the
removal of any brittle inner surface layers. To evaluate
this new material, ring-shaped samples were squashed at
room temperature at a constant displacement rate of

0.005 in./min. Total displacement (original ring dia-

meter minus minor axis of elliptical shaped specimen
after testing) was approximately 0.11 in., and under
these conditions no cracks developed in any of the
samples. Similar tests were then conducted on samples
from the %-, %-, and %-in.-OD tubes, and no cracking
occurred.

To gain practice in subassembly fabrication, we are
making a prototype of a head pot using molybdenum
components similar to those that will be used in
construction of the test stand. This prototype involves
all of the operations required to fabricate an actual
component: (1) electron-beam tube-to-header welds,
(2) roll bonding Y%-, %-, and %-in-OD tubes, (3)
tungsten coating the inside of each roll-bonded joint by
chemical vapor deposition, (4) electron-beam welding
two half sections together, (5) back brazing the outside
of the tube-to-header electron-beam-welded joints and
the roll-bonded joint, and (6) brazing a ring around the
3%-in.-OD girth weld joining the two half sections.

More detailed information on the design and purpose
of the molybdenum test stand is presented in Part 4 of
this report. Progress on welding, brazing, and fabrica-
~ tion of molybdenum components is reported in this
.chapter. Co

and upper disengaging vessel each require two back
extrusions with internal lengths of 3.5, 7.75, and 9 in.,
respectively, which are joined by girth welding (see Fig.
15.2). :

The results of the back extrusions are given in Table
15.1. All of the required back extrusions have been

+ fabricated and machined to final dimensions. However,

the spare back extrusions for the disengaging vessels
contained cracks in the wall that make them unusable
unless they can be repaired by welding. We are
presently back - extruding additional spare parts for
these vessels.

15.3 WELDING OF MOLYBDENUM
A. J. Moorhead

During this report period we have continued our
efforts to develop reliable procedures for joining com-
ponents of the molybdenum test stand. The full-scale
mockup shown in Fig. 15.1 was constructed of alumi-
num, stainless steel, and wood to aid in design of the
loop. (Proposed changes were incorporated in the
mockup as they were suggested in order to ensure that
they were compatible with the rest of the system.)
After the design of the test stand was finalized, we
began using the mockup to make certain that our
welding and brazing fixtures will fit in the allotted
spaces. This type of check is necessary since the
distances between lines and other components have

been held to a minimum. Additionally, the mockup has

195

is considerable advantage in using this tool compared
with manual welding, because it eliminates having to
rotate large sections of the loop inside the dry box. To

date, we have encouraging results when welding the
Y-in.-diam tubing using a weld insert, but equipment

been invaluable in determining the step-by-step se--

quence that will be used in construction of the test
stand.

Major progress was made during t this period in three

areas that are crucial for fabrication of the loop: (1)
girth joint welding, (2) tube-tube welding, and (3)
vent-tube welding. A decision was made to use electron
beam welding to join the half sections to form the four

pots required for the test stand. This process has the

advantage of allowing a self-aligning step type of joint
to be used and minimizes distortion and abnormal grain
growth. One disadvantage of this process is that the
joint fit-up must be very tight. In some of our earlier
developmental welds, the two half sections were held
together by a spring-loaded rod passing axially through
the center. This approach is not possible in some of the
test-stand vessels because of their internal configura-
tion. Therefore, we made a prototype part with the

problems have hindered our effort on the 1%-in. sizes.

Two electron-beam welds are required to attach the
vent tube to the bottom half of each feed pot. The first
attaches a nominal '%-in..diam “washer” to the end of
the tube. Subsequently, this subassembly is welded to a
trepanned joint inside the half section. On an earlier
attempt to weld this latter joint, the protruding tube
was impinged on and melted by the electron beam. The
joint was redesigned with an increase in the diameter of
the washer (to 0.585 in.) and a tighter fit between the
washer and the pothead. Both changes were made to

. ensure that the tube would not be hit by the beam.

These changes resulted in a successful weld on our
second attempt. This weld, which is shown in Fig. 15.3,

~ was not only leak-tight when bubble tested under

“alcohol with an argon pressure of 7 in. Hg, but also

helium leak-tight as well. The two feed pot bottoms are

"presently being remachined to incorporate this design

halves held together by three '/;,-in.-diam molybdenum .
pins passing ‘radially through the step joint. This

technique proved successful for making the girth weld.
Fluorescent dye-penetrant inspection revealed no de-

- fects in this weld, which is shown in Fig. 15.2. The

technique was repeated using potheads more nearly

similar to actual loop components, and it again proved BN

successful.
A commercially obtained (Rytek Corporation)
orbiting-arc weld head is being used to develop proce-

dures for joining the %- and 1%-in.-diam tubes for the

test stand. Although this head is heavier than the

- Astroarc head and is water cooled, the 125 A required

change.

15.4 DEVELOPMENT OF BRAZING TECHNIQUES
"FOR FABRICATING
THE MOLYBDENUM TEST LOOP

N.C. Cole

As was previously reported, we have brazed mock-
ups of the feed pots and disengaging sections of the
chemical processing test loop. We used an iron-based
filler metal (Fe—15% Mo—5% Ge—4% C—1% B), which
was developed to meet the requirement of this loop.
Brazing was accomplished in a vacuum furnace (<107%
torr) by heating at a rate of 5°C/min until flow of the
brazing alloy occurred. The parts were positioned in the
furnace so the braze alloy fillet could be observed
visually. Figure 15.4 shows an example of a 3%-in.-
diam molybdenum part in which short lengths of

- roll-bonded tubing were back brazed and a split ring

to fuse this relatively heavy wall molybdenum tubing is
at the upper limits of its capability. Because of this =

limitation, we have reduced the wall thickness of both
the %- and 1%-in.-OD tubing to 0.050 in. We fee! there

‘was brazed around the girth weld.
Sections of the -17-ft-long test loop will not fit into

* our vacuum furnace, and considerable effort has been

expended to design and build portable furnaces that -
will fit around the part to be brazed and will heat only

the immediate braze area. We have deyeloped two types
of portable heating sources, one heating by resistance
and the other by induction. Each has advantages and
disadvantages depending on the size and location of the
particular joint to be brazed.

The resistance furnaces have tantalum heating ele-
ments. Two types of furnaces have been built. One
consists of a continuous helical coil that will fit around
the joint to be brazed. The other is a split tantalum
sheet heater which can be opened and placed over the
welded joint in situ and then removed the same way
after brazing. This feature is extremely valuable for
sections where the furnace cannot be slipped over a
large or complex section to reach the braze region.
Using these heaters, we have been able to reach brazing
temperature on a mockup that consisted of a sleeve
around a %-in. tube with heat sinks similar to that on
the actual test loop. We are in the process of deter-
mining power output, time to brazing temperature, and
other parameters needed for brazing sleeves on tubes of
the sizes %, %, %., and %; in. diameter.

We have also developed induction heating techniques
for use either inside or outside an atmospheric chamber.
In the past we have experienced problems with arcing in
a dry box under argon or helium atmospheres as well as
in vacuum when the brazing alloy binder (used for

preplacing the filler metal) volatilized.* We have over-

come this difficulty by installing an auxiliary trans-

former that changes the high voltage from the induction
machine to low voltage—high amperage at the coil. With
this attachment we have been able to braze inside the
dry box in argon or helium without arcing problems. In
addition, by changing the size and shape of the copper
leads (from thin-walled tubing to thick bus bars), for
the first time we have been able to achieve brazing
temperature using split coils. Using a 1-in. split coil
either inside or outside the dry box, we have reached
* brazing temperature on a Y%-in. tube and matching
split-sleeve assembly. Split coils have an advantage in
removability, as discussed above for the split-resistance
heater. Unfortunately, the 1-in. split coil does not
couple well enough with the other sizes of tubing. Asa

result, we have ordered additional split coils for the

other sizes, both smaller and larger.
Both types of heating techniques can be used inside
an atmospheric chamber, but some joints will have to

be made with portable atmosphere-protection devices.

With ‘induction heating we will be able to braze by
protecting the molybdenum part from oxidation. If we
use the refractory-metal resistance furnace, we will have
to devise a technique to protect the heater as well.

15,5 COMPATIBILITY OF MATERIALS
WITH BISMUTH

"0.B. Cavin’ B.W. McCollum
J. L. Griffith © L.R. Trotter

We are studying the compatibility of potential struc-
tural materials with bismuth and bismuthithium solu-
tions at 700°C. Three different experimental techniques
are being used: (1) static capsule tests, (2) quartz
thermal convection loops for dynamic tests on samples
in up to 0.01 wt % (0.3 at. %) lithium in bismuth, and
(3) all-metal thermal convection loops for dynamic
testing in up to 3 wt % (48 at. %) lithium in bismuth.

15.5.1 Tantalum and T-111

We previously reported® that T-111 alloy (Ta—8%
W-2% Hf) showed excellent resistance to mass transfer
but lost its room-temperature ductility while being

‘tested in either bismuth or Bi—0.01 wt % Li at 600 to

700°C for 3000 hr. Tantalum, under similar conditions,
showed greater weight changes but no change in
ductility. We postulated that the loss of ductility in
T-111 could have been caused by an intergranular
hafnium-bismuth reaction. Recently, however, Inouye
and Liu,® in studying the brittle behavior of T-111,
have found that relatively small additions of oxygen in
T-111 can cause room-temperature embrittlement when
oxygen is added below 1000°C. For example, the
addition of 800 wt ppm oxygen to T-111 at 1000°C
will cause embrittlement, but at 815°C it takes only
400. wt ppm. Extrapolation of these data suggests that
oxygen concentrations as low as 100 to 200 ppm might
induce room-temperature embrittlement if the oxygen
is added at 600 to 700°C, which is in the range of our
loop operating temperatures. There is evidence that
oxygen reacts with hafnium to form hafnium oxide and
that the morphology and concentration of this oxide at
grain boundaries control the degree of embrittlement.
Our samples did pick up oxygen during exposure in the -
quartz loop, reaching approximately 150 wt ppm

‘oxygen, an increase of about 120 ppm during loop

operation. Because the oxygen pickup in T-111 ap- -
peared to have been associated with the use of quartz as
the ‘loop material, we built and operated an all-metal
T-111 alloy loop. This loop, which contained Bi—2.5 wt

% (44 at. %) Li, is presently being examined after
operating 3000 hr.

If, as seems to be indicated, the embrittlement of
T-111 is associated primarily with oxygen and hafnium,
it appears that we can circumvent this problem by
eliminating the hafnium as an alloying addition. To
further check this reasoning, we are testing a Ta—10 wt
% W alloy in a quartz thermal-convection loop con-
taining high-purity bismuth.

15.5.2 Graphite

One of the concerns in the consideration of graphite
for . processing equipment is the extent to which
bismuth-lithium alloys intrude into the graphite pores.
Tests with graphite specimens in a loop circulating
Bi—100 ppm Li, reported previously,” showed varying
amounts of intrusion. During this report period we
conducted tests with pure bismuth and with high-
lithium alloy (3 wt %, 48 at. %, Li) in crucibles made of
three grades of graphite. One similar’ test, under only
slightly different conditions, was conducted in the
Chemical Technology Division. As described below,
significant differences in intrusion were observed be-
tween pure bismuth and the high-lithium alloy, among
different grades of graphite, and between the Chemical
Technology Division test and our test with the same
grade of graphite.

Our tests used crucibles 4 in. long and 0.75 in. OD
with a wall thickness of 0.19 in., machined from ATJ,
AXF, and Graph-i-tite “A”. These three grades, ob-
tained from Carbon Products Division of Union Carbide
Corporation, from Poco Graphite, Inc., and from
Graphite Products Division of Carborundum Company,
respectively, differed in pore size and bulk density,
which was 1.79, 1.81, and 1.86 g/cm? respectively. One
set of nine crucibles (three of each grade) was filled
with high-purity bismuth and another set with Bi—3 wt
% Li alloy. Prior to filling, the graphite crucibles were
ultrasonically cleaned in absolute alcohol for 30 sec,
then dried for 16 hr at 190°C. High-purity bismuth was
added to the crucibles in the form of solid cast sticks.
In preparation for the alloy tests, sufficient bismuth-
lithium alloy to fill nine crucibles was first made in a
molybdenum-lined type 304L stainless steel pot by
adding small pieces of purified lithium to molten
purified bismuth. After each lithium addition, the melt
was agitated with a molybdenum rod to ensure com-
plete mixing and alloying. The melt was then cast into a

thin sheet, and pieces of this alloy were used to fill the
graphite crucibles, which were being held above the
melting temperature of the alloy. Each crucible was
then placed inside a stainless steel capsule and the end
cap welded on inside an argon-filled atmosphere cham-
ber. Each combination of graphite and metal was tested
at 700 + 5°C for. 500, 1000, and 3000 hr. As of this
writing, only the 500-hr specimens had been examined.

Metallography of the crucible cross sections after the
500-hr tests indicated that the high-purity bismuth did
not penetrate the open porosity of any of the grades of
graphite tested. Conversely, in the Bi—3 wt % Li tests,
the melt did intrude into crucible walls. Radiographs of
the three graphite grades after 500-hr exposures to the
bismuth-lithium alloy are shown in Fig. 15.5. One can
see that the greatest amount of penetration occurred in
the ATJ graphite, the lowest-density grade tested. This
penetration ‘was confirmed by metallography, and in
some regions of extremely low density the melt had
completely penetrated the wall. Figure 15.6 shows a
radiograph of a longitudinal half section of ATJ which

illustrates the variable degree of intrusion. This kind of
variation is not unusual considering the inherent varia-
tions in porosity of the graphite bodies from which the
crucibles were made.

The Chemical Technology Division used an ATJ
graphite crucible (1% in. OD, 1% in. ID, and 6 in.
long) to test the stability of lithium-bismuth solutions
in contact with graphite.® The crucible was first
degassed by heat treating for seven days at 1000°C in a
flowing argon atmosphere. It was then cooled to room
temperature, and sufficient amounts of solid lithium
and bismuth were added to produce 300 g (1% in.
deep) of a Bi—-2.2 wt % (40 at. %) Li alloy. The
temperature of the crucible was raised to 650°C in a

flowing argon atmosphere and held for 30 days, during

which time the melt was periodically sampled to
determine the lithium concentration in the melt.

8. F. J. Smith and C. T. Thompson, private communication.

199

Chemical analyses of filtered samples showed that the
lithium concentration was 2.05 + 0.03 wt % and
remained constant with time. Metallographic examina-
tion of the cross section of this crucible did not indicate
any significant metal intrusion, as shown in Fig. 15.7.
There is, however, a thin layer of as yet unidentified
nonmetallic material along the surface. It is difficult to
reconcile the absence of intrusion with the large open
porosity near the surface unless some surface layer
existed to seal off the pore entrance.

At present, discrepancies observed in the two differ-
ent static crucible tests can only be ascribed to
variations in experimental technique, such as crucible
degassing and alloy preparation. A program has been
initiated to investigate the effect of these and other
possible variables and also to determine how lithium
additions to bismuth increase the penetrating character-
istics of the melt.

15.5.3 Tungsten-Coated Hastelloy N

Both refractory metals and graphite require that
external surfaces of equipment be protected from
oxidation at temperatures of interest for MSBR fuel
reprocessing. One possibility for overcoming this restric-
tion would be to coat the inner surfaces of equipment
made of a conventional material with a thin layer of a
material that is compatible with the bismuth-lithium
alloys. To determine the feasibility of a protective
coating on such a material, the inner wall of a Hastelloy
N thermal convection loop was tungsten coated by
chemical vapor deposition.” Despite repeated attempts
to recoat,'® the tungsten had at least one small crack
when we decided to proceed with loop testing. The
loop operated for only about 24 hr at approximately
700°C when the bismuth started coming through the
wall in many spots, as shown in Fig. 15.8, Analysis of
the failure is in progress. = Co

ture of 696°C and a AT of 116 % 5°C. It contains
molybdenum tensile samples in Bi—2.5 wt % (44 at. %)

15.6 MOLYBDENUM BRAZE
ALLOY COMPATIBILITY

J. W. Koger

The compatibility of braze alloys for molybdenum is

being determined in environments similar to those that

will be encountered during reprocessing. Molybdenum
braze specimens previously exposed for 109 hr to
H,—20 vol % HF have been subsequently exposed to
LiF-BeF,-ZrF4-UF, (65.4-29.1-5.0-0.5 mole %) salt in
a capsule at 650°C for 115 hr. The specimens with 35M

braze alloy (Fe—15% Mo—4% C—1% B) lost 0.1118 g,
or approximately 0.2%, while a specimen with 42M
braze alloy (Fe—15% Mo—4% C—1% B—5% Ge) lost
0.0462 g, or approximately 0.1%. After the initial

- exposure to the gas mixture only, both specimens had
gained 0.01 g, probably due to the formation of metal’

fluoride reaction products. These products are likely
soluble in the salt and, therefore, contributed to the

. overall weight loss noted after exposure to the salt
_ mixture. Since molybdenum is known to be rather inert
in molten fluoride salts, it is suspected that most of the

weight loss may be attributed to the iron in the braze.
 

Part 4. Molten- Salt Processing and Preparation

- L.E. McNeese

Part 4 deals with the development of processes for the
isolation of protactinium and the removal of fission

products from molten-salt breeder reactors. During this

period we continued to evaluate and develop a flow-
sheet based on fluorination—reductive extraction for
protactinium isolation and the metal transfer process
for rare-earth removal. Work was initiated on a com-
puter program that can be used for calculating steady-
state concentrations and heat generation rates in an
MSBR processing plant. The behavior of 687 nuclides in
56 regions that represent the processing plant is
considered. The program will be used for carrying out
parametric studies involving the fluorination—reductive-
extraction—metal - transfer flowsheet and for making
comparative studies of flowsheets based on other
processing methods such as oxide precipitation.

Studies related to the chemistry of fuel reconstitution
were continued. It is believed that absorption of
gaseous UF, into molten salt containing UF, results in
the formation of UF, and gold apparatus was found tc
exhibit to exhibit satisfactory resistance to gaseous UF
and to UF; dissolved in MSBR fuel carrier salt
(72-16-12 mole % LiF-BeF,-ThF,) at 600°C. Under
certain conditions, UF disproportionated slowly, with
the rate of disproportionation being second order with
respect to UF concentration.

Studies were continued on the equilibrium distribu-
tion of lithium and bismuth between liquid lithium-
bismuth alloys and molten LiCl over the temperature
range 650 to 800°C. Data from these studies are
consistent with the observed behavior of lithium in the

second metal transfer experiment (MTE-2) completed

‘previously. The data are also - consistent with the
observed behavior of lithium in an engineering experi-
ment involving the metal transfer process (MTE-2B). In
this experiment the rate of transfer of lithium to LiCl
from lithium-bismuth solutions containing 3.5 to 15 at.
% lithium has been measured. The results indicate that
* the concentration of lithium in LiCl that is in equilib-

rium with a5 at. % lithium-bismuth solution, which will -

be used for removal of trivalent rare earths from LiCl,

will have a negligible effect on the metal transfer
process. The concentration of lithium in LiCl that is in
equilibrium with 50 at. % lithium-bismuth alloys, which
are proposed for removal of divalent rare earths from
the LiCl, is about 500 wt ppm; however, only about 2%
of the LiCl is fed to the divalent rare-earth removal
step, and the transfer of lithium will occur at an
acceptably low rate. Installation of the third experi-
ment (MTE-3) for development of the metal transfer
process was completed. The system has been. leak”

- checked and treated with hydrogen for oxide removal,

and the salt and bismuth phases are being purified and
transferred to the system. The experiment will use salt
flow rates that are 1% of the estimated flow rates
required for processing a 1000-MW(e) MSBR. Design
was- initiated for a facility in which we will carry out
the fourth metal transfer experiment (MTE-4). This
experiment will use salt flow rates that are 5 to 10% of

those which will be required for processing a

[SUSE

1000-MW(e) MSBR and will yield information on the

rate of transfer of rare earths in equipment of a design
suitable for a processing plant.

Our work on contactor development was continued
successfully during this report period. Mass transfer
experiments were carried out in which the rates of
transfer of zirconium and uranium from molten salt to

bismuth were measured in a 24-in.-long, 0.82-in.-ID -

column packed with ¥%-in. molybdenum Raschig rings.
The measured HTU (height of a transfer unit) values
range from 2.3 to 4.4 ft, which indicates that packed
column contactors can. be used successfully in MSBR
processing systems. Studies were continued on mechani-
cally agitated salt-metal contactors that are of particular
interest in the metal transfer process.

_ We have continued studies of oxide precipitation as
an alternative to the fluorination—reductive extraction
method for isolating protactinium and to fluorination
for subsequently removing uranium from MSBR fuel
salt. Additional data were obtained to define more

accurately the conditions required for the precipitation
of protactinium from an LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12

mole %) solution containing UF, by sparging the salt .

with H, O-HF-Ar gas mixtures. Operation of a small-
scale engineering facility was continued for investiga-
tion of the precipitation of UQ,-ThO, solid solutions
from molten fluoride salt by contacting the salt with
Ar-H, O mixtures. The precipitates have been observed

to settle rapidly, and the salt has been separated from ..

the oxide by decantation; minimal entrainment of
oxide has been observed. Samples of the salt and oxide

precipitate have shown that the two phases are not in
equilibrium. A precipitation process model in which the
solids, once formed, do not equilibrate with the salt has
been found to agree quite well with experimental data.
It appears that this effect can be exploited in order to
remove most of the uranium from MSBR fuel salt,
without the attendant removal of significant quantities
of ThO,, in a single-stage system rather than in a batch
countercurrent system containing three or more stages
(as we had thought would be required previously).
Results of these experiments are encouraging.

16. Flowsheet Analysis

The final report was written for a design study and a
cost estimate for a fluorination—reductive-extraction—

metal transfer processing plant that continuously pro-
cesses the fuel salt from a 1000-MW(e) MSBR. The

design - study pointed out the need for additional
information in three important areas: (1) finding
materials of construction suitable for containing molten
bismuth and bismuth-salt mixtures, (2) determining the
chemical behavior of noble metals in an MSBR, and (3)

“preventing entrainment of bismuth in salt leaving

bismuth-salt contactors.

A computer program that can be used for calculating
steady-state concentrations and heat generation rates in
an MSBR processing plant is being developed. The
behavior of a total of 687 nuclides in 56 regions that
represent the processing plant is presently treated by
the code.

16.1 DESIGN STUDY AND COST ESTIMATES
OF A PROCESSING PLANT
FOR A 1000-MW(e) MSBR
W. L. Carter . E.L. Nicholson
A design study and a cost estimate of the fluorina-

tion—reductive-extraction—metal transfer processing

plant for a 1000-MW(e) MSBR were concluded with the’
writing of a final report.! Most of the results from the
study were summarized previously.?2 The estimated
direct cost of the plant for a ten-day processing cycle is
$20.6 million, and the indirect cost is $15 million; the

total investment required is $35.6 million. Lowering the

" processing rate reduces the capital cost, and the total

investment was estimated to fall to $25 million at a
37-day cycle time.

The study, which consisted of a critical design
analysis of the flowsheet for the processing plant, not
only gave capital and operating costs but also identified
several areas where additional information is required.
Laboratory and engineering data show that the chemi-
cal- basis of the fluorination—reductive-extraction—
metal transfer process is fundamentally sound; however,
further development work is required in the areas
discussed below.

The most basic problem is to find a suitable material |

of construction for containing molten bismuth or
bismuth-salt mixtures. Molybdenum and graphite have
exhibited excellent corrosion resistance to the process
fluids. However, molybdenum is expensive and ex-

- tremely difficult fo fabricate, and the technology for

fabricating the shapes and sizes required for-a process-
ing plant has not yet been developed. The use of
graphite components in an otherwise all-metallic system
introduces design problems, and additional data are
needed on the compatibility of graphite with bismuth
containing reductant. Each of these materials needs
further evaluation and development.

In the design study, we assumed that noble-metal
fission products, that is, fission products whose free
energies of formation as fluorides are more positive
than the free energy of formation of CrF,, would be in
a reduced state in ‘the reactor and would be removed
rather quickly after formation by adhering to reactor
and heat exchanger surfaces. This assumption consider-
ably diminished the heat load in the processing plant
caused by the decay of fission products, particularly in
the gas recycle system. Although experience in MSRE
 

 

operation ‘indicates that noble-metal fission products
were removed from the salt, the behavior of these
fission products is not adequately understood; thus
additional data on their behavior in an MSBR are
required.

Since nickel-base alloys (of which the reactor would
be fabricated) are rapidly corroded by molten bismuth,
it is important that bismuth be contained in the areas of
the processing plant where it is used. Consequently, if
bismuth is entrained in salt leaving a. salt-bismuth
contactor, adequate measures for its removal to accept-
able levels must be taken. The problem not only
consists in removing bismuth to low concentrations but
also in detecting and measuring extremely small
amounts of bismuth entrained in salt. Current develop-

ment work on salt-bismuth contactors should provide a

better understanding of the extent of entrainment and
will allow testing of bismuth removal devices.

16.2 MULTIREGION CODE FOR MSBR
PROCESSING PLANT
FLOWSHEET CALCULATIONS

C.W.Kee . M.J.Bell L.E.McNeese

We are developing a computer code that can be used
for calculating steady-state concentrations and heat
generation rates in an MSBR processing plant. The
behavior of a total of 687 nuclides in 56 regions is
treated by the code. Consideration of this number of
nuclides is necessary, because many important heat
sources result from the decay of nuclides having short
half-lives, while nuclides that are present in significant
concentrations are normally longlived or stable. The
program can be easily expanded to include as many as
250 regions if needed. Each region can consist of two
phases that are in equilibrium, and a given region can
communicate with any other region by specifying a
flow of either of the phases that are present or by
rate-limited transfer of material from one of the phases.
The performance of a molten-salt breeder reactor is
represented by the computer code MATADOR, which
has been described previously.

Since there is no net accumulation of any nuclides in
a given region at steady state, a material balance on
nuclide 7 provides one equation for each of the regions
considered. The concentrations of nuclides in the
second phase of a region that represents an equilibrium
contact are related to those in the first phase by a set of
distribution - coefficients. For region n, a material
balance on nuclide i yields the following relation:

Approximately 38,000 simultaneous algebraic equa-
tions result from consideration of 687 nuclides in 56
regions of the processing plant. The simultaneous
solution of this number of equations, plus those
required for representing the behavior of nuclides in the
reactor, would normally be a formidable task. However,
if the processing plant is considered separately from the
reactor, and if the concentrations of each nuclide in the

_ processing plant are calculated before the concentra-

tions of daughters of the nuclide ‘are calculated, the set
of 38,000 equations can be divided into 687 subsets,
each of which consists of 56 equations. Direct solutions
can then be obtained for each of the subsets, and, in
this manner, the concentrations of all nuclides in all

 
 

 

regions of the processing plant can be calculated
directly for a specified set of concentrations in the
reactor. The results of this calculation are then used
with MATADOR for obtaining an improved estimate
for the concentrations of nuclides in the reactor.
Subsequently, the concentrations of nuclides in the
processing plant are recalculated. This sequence of
calculations provides for rapid convergence to the
steady-state concentrations in both the reactor and the
processing plant; these concentrations are then used to
calculate heat generation rates in each of the regions.

206

Convergence can be obtained with 18 iterations or less,

requiring 7 min or less of CPU time on an IBM 360/91
computer.
The code has been used for calculating heat genera-

‘tion rates and concentrations of all materials in a

processing - plant whose operation is based on the
fluorination—reductive-extraction—metal transfer flow-
sheet, and a copy of the results has been sent to the
group of Continental Oil Company employees currently

engaged in a design study for an MSBR processing plant.

as a part of the Ebasco Services subcontract. The
present work on the code is aimed at improving the
representation of process steps and minimizing the
effort necessary for specifying a flowsheet for which
calculations are desired. In the immediate future,
attention will be given to parametric studies of the
fluorination—reductive-extraction—metal transfer flow-
sheet, to a more complete representation of the
flowsheet, and to comparative studies of flowsheets
based on other processing methods such as oxide
precipitation. :
 

17. Processing Chemistry
L. M. Ferris

Several chemical aspects of the metal transfer
process'*? for the removal of rare earths and other
fission products from MSBR fuel salt received further
study. This work included measurements of the equilib-
rium distribution of lithium and bismuth between
liquid lithium-bismuth alloys and molten LiCl, measure-

17.1 DISTRIBUTION OF LITHIUM AND BISMUTH
BETWEEN LIQUID LITHIUM-BISMUTH ALLOYS
AND MOLTEN LiCl

L.M. Ferris J.F.Land

In the metal transfer process, »2 rare earths and the
attendant small amount of thorium would be stripped

"from the LiCl acceptor salt into lithium-bismuth solu-

tions having lithium concentrations of § to 50 at. %. In
preliminary work,> we showed that at 650°C, both
lithium and bismuth distributed between liquid lithium-
* bismuth alloys and molten LiCl and that the extent of
the distribution to the LiCl increased with increasing
lithium concentration in the liquid alloy. Furthermore,
since the ratio of the “free” lithium to bismuth present
in the salt phase was 3, it was suggested that the data
could be interpreted in terms of the distribution of the
saltlike species Li; Bi between the two phases.

'M. A. Bredig* has proposed a model to describe the
distribution of LiyBi between a liquid lithium-bismuth

alloy and molten LiCl. In this model, the activity of
Li, Bi dissolved in LiCl is defined as

@yi,8i(d) = VLisBi(d) TLisBi(d) » Mm

in which d denotes dissolved species in the salt phase, N
is mole fraction, and 4 is an activity coefficient.
Equation (1) can also be written as

811, Bi(d) = VBi(d) TLisBi(d)

= [NLiay/3] TLisBicy,

in which Ney) and Nj; 4 are the measured mole
fractions of bismuth and “free” lithium in the LiCl.
Concentrations in the alloy phase are defined by
assuming that the following reaction occurs when
lithium is added to bismuth:

in which m denotes dissolved species in the lithium-

both phases, at equilibrium and at a given temperature,
Eqs. (2) and (6) can be equated. After appropriate
substitutions and rearrangements, we obtain, in log-
arithmic form,

in which Ny; is the mole fraction of lithium in the

“YLi3Bi(m), Were constant at a given temperature, I"
would be a constant; in this case, a plot of log Ng dy or
log [Ny ;(qy/3] vs the logarithm of the bracketed term
on- the right-hand side of Eq. (7) would give a straight
line of unit slope.

During this report period, we made additional meas-
urements of the equilibrium distribution of LisBi
between liquid lithium-bismuth alloys and molten LiCl
in the temperature range 650 to 800°C. The apparatus
and general procedure have been described elsewhere.’
After each equilibration period, samples of the salt
phase were removed by means of molybdenum pipets.
Each salt sample was hydrolyzed in water, and the
hydrogen that was evolved was collected; then the
quantity was determined by gas chromatography. The
quantity of hydrogen evolved was assumed to be
equivalent to the amount of “free” lithium dissolved in
the salt. The hydrolysis residue was acidified to dissolve
any precipitated bismuth, and an aliquot of the
resulting solution was used for bismuth analysis. When
the bismuth concentration in the salt was greater than
about 100 wt ppm, a colorimetric analytical method
was used. An inverse-polarographic method was used to
determine bismuth at lower concentrations. The lithium
concentrations in the liquid alloys were determined by
flame-photometric analysis.

Equilibrium data obtained at selected temperatures in
the range of 650 to 800°C obeyed the relationship
represented by Eq. (7) over a wide range of alloy
compositions, justifying the assumption made regarding
the activity coefficient ratio. This is illustrated in Fig.
17.1, using data obtained at 650°C. The placement of
the line (which has a slope of unity) was established

- primarily by the bismuth concentrations because these

could be determined analytically with greater accuracy
than the lithium concentrations in the salt. As seen, the
lithium concentration in the alloy was varied from

‘about 10 to 50 at. %, and the equilibrium lithium and
bismuth concentrations in the LiCl changed by about
three orders of magnitude. Similar isotherms were

obtained at 700, 750, and 800°C. Values of I" obtained
from the respective isotherms were as follows:

700 037

17.2 SOLUBILITY OF EUROPIUM
IN LIQUID BISMUTH

F.J.Smith C.T.Thompson

No measurements of the solubility of europium in
liquid bismuth have been reported in the literature. We
made measurements of this type over the temperature
range 325 to 550°C and obtained results that can be

expressed as log Sp, (wt %) = 4.4823 — 2973/T(°K). .

These solubilities are considerably higher than those

reported® for the other lanthanides over the same

temperature range. Interestingly, the heats of solution

of all the lanthanides in liquid bismuth appear to be -

about the same.

In our previous studies,” we found evidence for the
mutual interaction, in liquid bismuth solution, of
thorium with the trivalent lanthanides neodymium and
lanthanum. Under appropriate conditions, compounds
of the apparent composition ThLnBi, were formed. In
recent work, we found that thorium and europium also
.interact in bismuth solution to form a thorium- and
europium-containing solid. However, the mutual solu-
bilities of thorium and europium in liquid bismuth are
“more than adequate to satisfy metal transfer process
conditions.

17.3 INTEGRAL HEATS
OF LITHIUM-BISMUTH SOLUTIONS

- L. M. Ferris

At various points in the fluorination—reductive-
extraction—metal transfer flowsheet!? for processing
_ MSBR fuel salt, either lithium is added to a bismuth
‘stream or lithiumrbismuth solutions having different
lithium concentrations are mixed. Also, in an actual
plant, mixing of lithium-bismuth solutions will occur in
dump tanks that will be provided for collecting various

209

lithium-bismuth soiutions in the event of an emergency
or scheduled shutdown. Knowledge of the integral heats
of solution allows estimation of the heats of the various
reactions involved.

We used the emf data of Foster, Wood, and
Crouthamel® to calculate partial molar enthalpies for
lithium in lithium-bismuth solutions. Their data for
solutions containing up to about 55 at. % lithium are
presented as:

- [9397 + 18.167 — 0.010972]
— [7103 — 19.44T + 0.0068T2] N;; (9)

Using the values of a and b from Eq. (12), we obtain
the following expression for the integral heats of
formation of lithium-bismuth solutions at 650°C:

AH. (keal/g-atom soln) = —19.993N; ;

To a first approximation, the ‘wig heats of solution
can 1 be expressed as

soln

It is readily deduced from Eq. (16) or Eq. (17) that
the formation of a lithium-bismuth solution of high
lithium concentration is a strongly exothermic reaction.
For example, the formation of 1 g-atom (about 100 g)
of lithium-bismuth (50-50 at. %) from the elements
results in a heat release of about 10 kcal. The calculated
heats of mixing or dilution of lithium-bismuth solutions
based on Eq. (16) are quite small and are endothermic.

17.4 PROTACTINIUM OXIDE
PRECIPITATION STUDIES

O.K. Tallent L.M. Ferris

Studies in support of the development of oxide
precipitation processes for isolating protactinium and

uranium from MSBR fuel salt have been continued. We

are investigating a process in which salt from the reactor
would be treated with the appropriate HF-H, O-Ar gas
mixture to convert practically all of the protactinium to
Pa’* and to precipitate a large fraction of the protactin-
ium as Pa, Os without precipitating uranium oxide.
- Protactinium has been systematically precipitated
from molten LiF-BeF,-ThF4-UF, solutions at 600 and
at 650°C by equilibrating the salt with various HF-H, O-
Ar gas mixtures; previously described equipment and
experimental procedures were used.’ The data obtained
were considered in terms of the equilibrium

In the above expressions, d, g, s, NV, and p denote

“dissolved species, gas, solid, mole fraction, and partial

pressure respectively. If the ratio Pu,0/Pur is fixed at
some value 4, Eq. (19) c can be written, in logarithmic
form, as

log Np,g, =2.5 log (py p/A) — log 0; (20)

At each temperature, log-log plots of protactinium
concentration in the salt vs Pur/A should be linear
with a slope of 2.5.

In a previous report’ we presented data (from
experiments I and II) obtained at 600°C. with salt
containing 0.08 and 0.25 mole % UF, respectively.
These data obeyed the relationship represented by Eq.
(20).- However, - the protactinium, concentrations as
determined by gamma spectrometry were usually higher
than the protactinium concentrations determined by
the alpha-pulse-height method. In examining the
gamma-spectrometric method, we found that 2!%Pb
was contributing to the apparent 233Pa count rate.
After correcting for the contribution of the 2! 2Pb, we
obtained excellent agreement between the gamma-
spectrometric and the alpha-pulse-height analyses.

Recently, we completed two more experiments (ex-
periments III and IV) using salt in which the uranium
concentration was 2. 0.2 mg/g (about 0.05 mole %).
Data from these experiments, which were conducted at
600 and 650°C, respectively, are incorporated in Table
17.1 with corrected data from our earlier experiments.
The protactinium concentrations listed were deter-
mined by gamma spectrometry. Log-log plots of the
equilibrium protactinium concentrations in the salt vs
Pur/A gave lines of slope 2.5 at each temperature (Fig.
17.2). This behavior supports the assumption that
essentially pure Pa, Oj is the solid phase at equilibrium.
From these plots we get Q;, values of 3.9 £ 0.5 at
600°C and 21 + 4 at 650°C.

In each experiment, the salt samples: were also
analyzed for uranium. The general behavior of uranium
at 600°C is illustrated in the upper part of Fig. 17.3. As

‘seen, the uranium concentration in the salt remained

constant, within analytical error, at its initial value
while the protactinium concentration decreased with
decreasing py p/A as the result of the precipitation of

The above data strongly indicate that it will be
impossible to precipitate a large fraction of the protac-
tinium without precipitating some UO, if the initial
protactinium concentration is 100 wt ppm (the protac-
tinium concentration in an MSBR from which protac-

_tinjum is removed on a five-day cycle). As a con-

sequence, flowsheet variations involving coprecipitation
of protactinium ‘and uranium will receive further
evaluation.

17.5 CHEMISTRY OF FUEL RECONSTITUTION
M.R. Bennett  L. M. Ferris

In the current flowsheet!:? for the processing of

. MSBR fuel, the fuel reconstitution method involves,

first, absorbing the UF4 evolved in the fluorination step
in salt containing dissolved UF, and, then, reducing the
resultant higher-valent uranium species to UF, with

gaseous hydrogen. The expected sequence of reaction
is:

UF, (g) + UF4(d) = 2UFs(d) , 29
2UFs(d) + Hy (2) =2UF4(d) + 2HF(g). (25)

Studies of the chemistry involving the fuel reconstitu-
tion step, initiated prior to the last reporting period, ?
have continued.

Originally,!? scouting experiments were conducted
primarily to find a container that was inert to UF
dissolved in molten fluoride salts. In these experiments,
it appeared that both gold and type ATJ graphite were
stable at 600°C to LiF-BeF,-ThF4 (72-16-12 mole %)
that contained 6 to 12 wt % uranium as UF. The
results of more recent experiments show that, under
most conditions, graphite is not suitable for the
containment of salts containing dissolved UF. In two
of these experiments, sufficient UF¢ ‘was added to
LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12 mole %) containing dissolved
UF, to produce solutions in which the UFs concentra-
tions were about 2 and 4 wt % respectively. Analyses of
salt samples taken at various times after the addition of
UF to the system showed that the total uranium
concentration in the salt remained constant but that the
UF; concentration decreased with time according to
second-order kinetics. As the UF concentration de-
creased, a corresponding increase in the pressure of the
system occurred. Mass-spectrographic analyses of sam-
ples of the gas showed that they contained significant
amounts of CF, and C, Fg, in the ratio of about 6:1.
These results indicated that UFs was disproportionating
to UF, and UF. Since the total uranium concentration
in the salt remained constant, we postulate that the

UF; produced by disproportionation of UF; reacted:

with graphite to yield dissolved UF, and gaseous
fluorocarbons. The apparent stability of graphite to salt
containing UFs noted ‘in our earlier tests'? may be

related to the very high UF; concentrations in the salt

in those tests, as discussed later. :

Our most recent series of experiments w was s conducted
using the same type of apparatus and procedure as
described previously;! 2 ‘however, most portions of the
system that were exposed to salt or gaseous UF, (the

~ crucible, sparge tube, thermowell, and sampler) were
- fabricated of gold. In the first experiment in this series

(experiment 15-UR), 200 g of LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-
12 mole %) containing 1.13 wt % uranium as UF, was

first sparged for 48 hr at 600°C with HF-H, (50-50
mole %). Then, sufficient UF¢ was bubbled into the salt
at 600°C to convert 75 to 80% of the uranium to UFs.

The system was subsequently left under a slight argon

pressure, and samples of the salt were removed periodi-
cally. Analyses of these samples showed that both the
US* and the total uranium concentrations in the salt
decreased with time (see Table 17.2), presumably due
to the disproportionation of dissolved UF; [the reverse

of reaction (24)]. The disproportionation appeared to
be second order with respect to. UF; concentration, as
evidenced by the linearity of a plot of the reciprocal of
the UF; concentration vs time (Fig. 17.5) and the fact
that the net decrease in UF; concentration was about
twice that of the total uranium concentration (Table
17.2).

Salt samples from experiment  15-UR were also
analyzed for gold. Each analysis showed that the gold
concentration in the salt was less than 200 wt ppm and

. that corrosion, if it occurred, essentially all took place

during the 48-hr hydrofluorination period. No further
increase in gold concentration was detected either after
the UF; was introduced into the melt or during the
subsequent eight-day period in which UF; was present
in the salt. These results confirm our earlier indica-
tions! 2 that gold is suitable as a container for molten

fluoride salts containing dissolved UF.

In experiment 16-UR, UF was added to salt contain-
ing 1.69 wt % uranium as UF, to produce a salt in
which the total uranium concentration was 3.1 wt %;
analyses (Table 17.2) showed that 86% of the uranium
was present as U>* after addition of the UFg. As in
other experiments, the UFs was absorbed very rapidly
by the salt. The color of a quenched sample of the
original salt that contained uranium only as UF, was
light green, but the color of a similar sample taken
immediately after addition of UF¢ was almost white.
As seen in Table 17.2 and Fig. 17.5, both the total
uranium and the U%* concentrations decreased very
slowly with time and did not follow second-order
kinetics. These results suggest that some UF, was
present in the vapor phase and, therefore, that the
system was close to steady-state conditions.

Results obtained in experiment 17-UR were similar to
those of experiment 16-UR. In the first part of this
experiment, we attempted to add to LiF-BeF;-ThF,
(72-16-12 mole %) containing 2.57 wt % uranium as
UF, the amount of UF4 required to convert all the
uranium to UFs. The average of the analyses of six
samples taken immediately after addition of the UF4
showed that about 91% of the uranium was present as
UF; (Table 17.2). As before, the color of the salt after
the addition of UF4 was nearly white. After these
samples had been removed, UF; was bubbled through
the salt until its sorption on an NaF trap in the exit line
was detected. Six samples of the salt were removed
immediately after this treatment. Analyses of these
samples showed that both the total uranium and the
UFs concentrations in the salt had not changed
significantly. Quenched samples of the salt after this
treatment were practically snow-white. The system was

left at 600°C, and the samples of the salt were
withdrawn periodically. As found in experiment 16-UR,

both the total uranium and the U%* concentrations

decreased only very slowly (Table 17.2, Fig. 17.5),
suggesting that the system was nearly at steady state.
We conclude from the above series of experiments

that gold is inert at 600°C both to gaseous UF and to

UF; (in concentrations up to at least 5 wt %) dissolved

in "LiF-BeF,-ThF; (72-16-12 mole %). The results

obtained also show that UFs, when added to salt
containing dissolved UF,, reacts very rapidly with the

UF, to form UF; according to reaction (24). When

excess UF was bubbled through the salt in experiment
17-UR, the oxidation state of the uranium that was
dissolved in the resultant salt did not exceed 5+,
suggesting that the solubility of UF, in the salt is low at
600°C. In experiment 15-UR, in which the U** concen-

tration in the salt was 1.6 wt % or lower, UFs

disproportionated by a second-order process. However,
the results obtained in experiments 16-UR and 17-UR,
in which the US* concentrations were initially greater
than 2.5 wt %, suggest that sufficient UFg was present
in the vapor phase to retard the disproportionation of
 

UF;. It is probable that no detectable disproportiona-
tion would have occurred in these experiments if the
entire system had been constructed of gold. We
speculate that near-equilibrium conditions were estab-
lished initially but that gaseous UF was slowly
consumed by reaction with the nickel containment

vessel. This effect would be less apparent with high

concentrations of UF and, undoubtedly, was responsi-

215

ble for our earlier indications! ? that graphite was stable

in salts containing 6 to 12 wt % UF.

Preliminary experiments relative to the reduction of
dissolved UF with gaseous hydrogen have been con-
ducted. No quantitative results are available. It appears,
however, that UF; is easily reduced by hydrogen but
the hydrogen utilization (in our apparatus, at least) is
quite low.

 
 

 

18. Engineering Development of Processing Operations

L. E. McNeese

Studies related to the development of a number of
processing operations were continued during this report
period. Additional information on the behavior of
lithium during metal transfer experiment MTE-2 was
obtained. The results are consistent with a recently
developed correlation of data. concerning the distri-
bution of lithium and bismuth between LiCl and
lithium-bismuth solutions. Operation of experiment
MTE-2B was continued in order to further study the
transfer of lithium from lithium-bismuth solutions
containing lithium at concentrations of 3.7 to 16 at. %.
Installation of equipment for the third engineering
experiment for development of the metal transfer
process (MTE-3) has been completed. The equipment
has been leak tested and treated with hydrogen for the

removal of oxides, and the salt and bismuth phases for

the experiment are now being purified and transferred

_ to the system. Design for a facility that will be used for

the fourth engineering experiment on the metal transfer
process (MTE-4) has been initiated. The experiment will
use salt flow rates that are 5 to 10% of those that will
be required for processing a 1000-MW(e) MSBR. Overall
mass transfer coefficients were obtained with a water-
mercury system in a stirred interface contactor of the
type being used for developing the metal transfer
process. The experimentally determined mass transfer
coefficients are quite close to those predicted by
extrapolation of a literature correlation that is based on
data from organic-solvent—water systems. Experiments
were continued in which the rates of transfer of *7Zr

and ?37U from molten salt to bismuth were measured

during the countercurrent contact of salt with bismuth
in a packed column. Design and development work
were initiated for the reductive-extraction process

. facility which will allow testing and development of all

steps of the reductive-extraction process fof isolation of
protactinium with salt flow rates as high as 25% of
those required for processing a 1000-MW(e) MSBR.
Studies of methods for generating heat in molten salt

216

were continued in order that nonradioactive ‘tests of a
frozen-wall fluorinator could be carried out. Tests were
made using both induction and autoresistance heating.
We have continued to operate a small-scale engineering
facility in order to investigate the precipitation of
UO, -ThO, solid solutions from molten fluoride mix-
tures by contacting the salt with mixtures of argon and
water. Designs of the components for the processing
materials test stand and of the molybdenum reductive
extraction equipment were continued, and fabrication
of some of the structural parts of the test stand was
started. An’ eddy-current-type bismuth-salt interface
detector was tested at temperatures in the range of 550
to 700°C, and the probe appears to be a sensitive and
practical indicator for determining the bismuth level or
for locating the salt-bismuth interface.

18.1 LITHIUM TRANSFER DURING METAL
TRANSFER EXPERIMENT MTE-2

E.L. Youngblood L. E. McNeese

During metal transfer experiment MTE-2, the lithium
concentration in the lithium-bismuth phase that was
used to extract rare earths from the LiCl decreased
from an initial value of 0.35 mole fraction to 0.18 mole
fraction after 570 liters of LiCl had been contacted
with the lithium-bismuth solution.! Only a small
fraction of this decrease can be accounted for by the
reaction of rare earths with lithium. The major portion
of the decrease is believed to be associated with the
circulation of LiCl, since little or no decrease occurred
during periods of noncirculation. Previously, the rate of
decrease of the lithium concentration in the lithium-
bismuth solution in experiment MTE-2 was compared
with information that was calculated using equilibrium

calculated values were in good agreement. Since that
time, additional data have been obtained, and a theoret-
ical correlation has been developed (see Sect 17.1)
for the concentration of metallic lithium and bismuth
in LiCl that is in equilibrium with lithium-bismuth
solutions. The variation of the lithium concentration in
the lithium-bismuth solution during experiment MTE-2
has been recalculated using the latter correlation for
determining the concentration of lithium in the LiCl
after contact with the lithium-bismuth solution. A
comparison of the experimental values with calculated
values is shown in Fig. 18.1. The best agreement
between the calculated and measured values was ob-

- tained by assuming that the concentration of lithium in

18.2 OPERATION OF METAL TRANSFER
EXPERIMENT MTE-2B

E. L. Youngblood L. E. McNeese

We are continuing to operate metal transfer experi-
ment MTE-2B (which was described previously’) to
measure the rate at which metallic lithium is transferred
by circulation of LiCl between alithum-bismuth solu-
tion (containing from 3.7 to 16 at. % lithium) and a
thorium-bismuth solution (initially containing about
0.02 mole % thorium and 0.2 mole % lithium).
Lithium-bismuth solutions containing 5 to 50 at. %
lithium are used for removing rare earths from LiCl in
the metal transfer process. The concentrations of
metallic lithium and bismuth in LiCl that is in equilib-
rium with lithium-bismuth solutions containing from
about 10 to 50 at. % lithium have been determined in
laboratory studies. However, because of the low con-
centration (<1 ppm) of metallic lithium in LiCl that is
in equilibrium with lithium-bismuth solutions con-
taining less than 10 at. % lithium, it is very difficult to
determine the lithium concentration by direct analysis
of the LiCl. The rate of transfer of metallic lithium by
circulation of LiCl in experiment MTE-2B can be
determined by several methods that do not require
direct analysis of the LiCl; this allows study of the
transfer of lithium from lithium-bismuth solutions
containing lithium concentrations of less than 10 at. %.

The equipment used in experiment MTE-2B has been
described previously! and is shown schematically in
Fig. 18.2. All components that contact salt and bismuth
are fabricated of carbon steel. The main vessel is

“constructed of 6-in.-diam sched 40 pipe and is divided

into two compartments by a partition that extends to

. within % in. of the bottom of the vessel. The two

compartments are interconnected by a pool of bismuth
containing reductant. One compartment contains fluo-

- ride salt (67-33 mole % LiF-BeF,) to which 11 mCi of

‘was 95% of the equilibrium value. The calculated values
‘based on the new correlation are in better agreement

147NdF; and sufficient ThF, to produce a concen-
tration of 0.19 mole % had been added. The other
compartment contains LiCl. ‘A separate electrically
insulated vessel containing a lithium-bismuth solution is
connected to the LiCl compartment with a %-in.-diam
sched 80 pipe. During operation, molten LiCl is’
circulated between the lithium-bismuth vessel and the
compartmented vessel at the rate of about 25 cm®/min;
by pressurizing the lithium-bismuth container with
argon, .the LiCl ‘is- forced to flow back and forth

"between the main vessel and the vessel containing the
“ lithium-bismuth solution. Gas-lift sparge tubes are used

to improve the contact of the salt and metal phases.
The experiment is being operated at 645°C.

 
 

 

218°

The experiment is designed in a manner such that
data on lithium transfer can be obtained by. the
following independent methods:

-1. Direct determination of lithium in the lithium-

bismuth solution used for extraction of rare earths
from the LiCl. ;

2. Direct determination of the lithium and thorium
concentrations in LiCl in equilibrium with the
lithium-bismuth solution.

3. Determination of the rate at which lithium is
transferred from the lithium-bismuth solution to the
main bismuth pool, as indicated by changes in the
distribution coefficients for thorium and !*7Nd.
The composition of the fluoride salt and the relative
volumes of the fluoride salt and bismuth were
chosen so that the maximum thorium concentration
that can be obtained in the bismuth is only one-half
the solubility of thorium in bismuth. This prevents

the bismuth phase from becoming saturated with
thorium. If saturation occurs, the thorium and
neodymium distribution coefficients will not be
sensitive to the transfer of lithium into the main
bismuth pool.

4. Measurement of the voltage that is developed when
the two bismuth phases containing lithium are
connected by the LiCl. It has been found that the
developed voltage can be interpreted in terms of a
concentration cell involving bismuth phases that
contain lithium at different concentrations.

Data from the initial operation of the experiment
have been reported previously.! These data, as well as
data obtained during this report period, are summarized
in Figs. 18.3, 18.4, and 18.5. The concentration of
lithium in the thorium-bismuth phase as determined by
direct analysis is compared in Fig. 18.3 with values for

thorium-bismuth phase as determined from the distri-
bution of thorium between the fluoride salt and the
thorium-bismuth solution is compared in Fig. 18.4 with
lithium concentration values that were calculated from
emf measurements. Values for the lithium concen-
tration in the thorium-bismuth solution as indicated
from neodymium distribution data are compared in Fig.
18.5 with values for the lithium concentration that
were calculated from emf measurements. The values for
the lithium concentration in the thorium-bismuth solu-
tion as determined by direct analysis, from thorium
distribution data, and from emf measurements are in

good agreement. The values based on the distribution of

“neodymium are somewhat lower and show more scatter

than those obtained with the other methods.

During the first four months of LiCl circulation (in
which 2307 liters of LiCl was circulated), the lithium
concentration in the lithium-bismuth solution was
maintained -at values in the range of 3.7 to 6.0 at. %.
The lithium concentration in the lithium-bismuth solu-
tion was initially 4.5 at. %; however, it decreased to a

“value of 3.7 at. % after 1589 liters of LiCl had been
circulated. Sufficient lithium was then added to the

lithium-bismuth solution to produce a lithium concen-
tration of 6 at. %. During the first four months of

operation, the lithium concentration in the lithium-
bismuth solution decreased steadily, at a rate equivalent
to a lithium concentration of 0.2 ppm in the LiCl after
“its contact with the lithium-bismuth solution. It would
be expected that this lithium would be transferred to
the thorium-bismuth solution and that the concen-
tration of reductant in the thorium-bismuth phase
would increase steadily. However, during this period,
the concentrations of both the lithium and the thorium
in the thorium-bismuth solution decreased; the rate at
which reductant was lost from the thorium-bismuth
solution was twice the loss rate from the lithium-
bismuth solution. After 1021 liters of LiCl had been
circulated through the system, 8.4 g of thorium was
added to ‘the thorium-bismuth phase in order to
increase the reductant concentration to near its original
value. Additional .1#7Nd tracer and LiCl were also
added to the system at that time. The decrease in the
reductant concentration in the thorium-bismuth solu-
tion probably resulted from the reaction of reductant
- with impurities introduced into the system by the argon
purges or by the removal of samples of salt and
bismuth. If the loss of reductant was due entirely to
reaction with oxygen in the purge gas, an oxygen
concentration of about 10 ppm would be required.
Extrapolation of laboratory data on the concentration
of lithium in LiCl that is in equilibrium with a 5 at. %
Li-Bi solution indicates a lithium concentration of
about 0.02 ppm. Thus the mechanism for the removal
of most of the lithium from the lithium-bismuth
solution must have been the reaction of lithium with
impurities in the LiCl.

After 2307 liters of LiCl had been circulated through
the system, the lithium concentration in the lithium-
bismuth solution was increased to 15.6 at. %. At this
lithium concentration, the rate of transfer of lithium by
the LiCl was sufficient to cause the concentrations of
lithium and thorium in the thorium-bismuth solution to
increase at a rate equivalent to a lithium concentration
of 0.2 ppm. in the LiCl after contact with the
lithium-bismuth solution. If it is assumed that loss of
reductant by its reaction with impurities in the system
continuéd at a rate equivalent to a lithium concen-
tration of 0.6 ppm, the resulting lithium transfer rate
(0.8 ppm) is in reasonable agreement with the concen-

tration of lithium (1.2 ppm) that would be present in

LiCl in equilibrium with a 15 at. % lithium-bismuth

_ solution.

The inventory of '*7Nd tracer.in the system de-
creased more rapidly than expected during operation of
the experiment, presumably because of reaction of the
neodymium with impurities in the system. The neo-

" -dymium transferred to the lithium-bismuth phase as
expected during the experiment; however, because of
_ the decrease in neodymium inventory, the rate of

transfer could not be accurately determined. Only a
negligible amount of thorium (<10 ppm) has been
transferred to the lithium-bismuth solution thus far. A
lithium concentration of about 15 at. % in the
lithium-bismuth solution is being used in the continued
operation of the experiment. The information obtained
to date ‘is consistent with the experimentally deter-
mined results for the distribution of lithium between
LiCl and lithium-bismuth solutions and indicates that

x
 

the rate of transfer of lithium from a § at. %
lithium-bismuth solution in the metal transfer process
will be. negligible. The rate of transfer of lithium from a
50 at. % lithium-bismuth solution will be appreciable;
however, such transfer will not necessitate changes in
the present processing flowsheet or increases in the rate
at which reductant is added to the processing system.

18.3 INSTALLATION, TESTING, AND CHARGING
OF MATERIALS TO THE THIRD METAL
TRANSFER EXPERIMENT

E.L. Youngblood H.O.Weeren
L. E. McNeese

Equipment for the third metal transfer experiment
(MTE-3) has been installed, and the system is currently
being prepared for operation. Details of the main
process vessels, which are constructed of carbon steel,
have been presented previously.> The experiment is

shown schematically in Fig. 18.6 and after installation

in Fig. 18.7. The basic equipment consists of a
14-in.-diam surge tank that contains fluoride salt
(72-16-12 mole % LiF-BeF,-ThF,), a 10-in.-diam salt-
metal contactor, and a 6-in.-diam vessel that contains a
5 at. % lithium-bismuth solution and LiCl. The con-
tactor is divided into two compartments by a partition

221

that extends to within % in. of the bottom of the
vessel. The two compartments are interconnected by a
pool of bismuth containing thorium and lithium. The
bismuth solution in the contactor also provides a seal
between the two compartments. During operation, the
fluoride salt will be circulated at the rate of about 33
cm®/min from the surge tank through one side of the
contactor by a carbon-steel pump that uses molten
bismuth as check valves? Lithium chloride will be

"forced to flow back and forth between the vessel

containing ‘the lithium-bismuth solution and the salt-
bismuth contactor at the rate of about 1.25 liters/min.
The salt flow rates to be used in the experiment are
about 1% of those that will be required for processing a
1000-MW(e) MSBR. The system will be operated at
about 650°C. Mechanical agitators are used in both
‘compartments of the contactor and. in the vessel
containing the lithium-bismuth solution in order to
improve the contact between the salt and the bismuth

* phases.

The main -objectives of the experiment are to deter-
mine the rate at which rare earths and alkaline-earth
elements will be transferred from the fluoride salt to
“the lithium-bismuth solution and to determine the
dependence of the mass transfer coefficients at the
salt-bismuth interfaces on agitator speed. The agitators
(see Fig. 18.8) are constructed of molybdenum and use
blades having a pitch of 45° in both the salt and the
bismuth phases. The agitators are designed to vigorously

either phase. If adequate contact of the salt and
bismuth can be achieved without dispersion, this will
be a more desirable operating mode, since entrainment
of bismuth in the fluoride salt will be much less likely
to occur than in systems where the bismuth is dispersed
in the salt phase. The agitators are driven by variable-
speed motors, which will permit determination of the
effect of agitator speed on the mass transfer coefficients
at the three salt-metal interfaces. Data on mass transfer
coefficients obtained in the experiment will be com-
pared with values predicted from correlations that were
developed for liquids having physical properties appreci-
ably different from those of molten salt and bismuth.

Preoperational testing of the equipment, purification
of the salt and bismuth, and charging of the salt and
bismuth to the system have begun. Initially, the systém
was determined to be leak-tight at room temperature by
use of a helium leak detector. The main process vessels
were then heated to 650°C, and a pneumatic pressure
test was carried out at 12.5 psig (1.25 times the

maximum operating pressure). The leak testing was
followed by treatment of the system with hydrogen for
12 hr at 650°C in order to reduce iron oxide that was
present on the internal surfaces of the equipment. The
fluoride salt, bismuth, and LiCl are also being treated
for removal of oxides and other impurities before being
charged to the equipment. The quantities of salt and
bismuth that will be used in the experiment are shown
in Table 18.1. Bismuth for the contactor was treated
with hydrogen at 600 to 650°C for 6.5 hr in. a
carbon-steel treatment vessel and was filtered before
being transferred to the contactor. The fluoride salt for
the experiment was previously purified by the Reactor
Chemistry Division; however, in small-scale metal trans-
fer experiments, we have observed that, when salt is
contacted with bismuth containing reductant, there is
an initial decrease in the quantity of reductant in the
bismuth phase. The reason for the decrease has not
been determined. In order to minimize this effect in
experiment MTE-3, the fluoride salt was contacted (in
two batches) with bismuth initially containing 1.9 wt %

18.4 DESIGN OF THE METAL TRANSFER
PROCESS FACILITY

W.L. Carter E. L. Nicholson
E.L. Youngblood L. E. McNeese

We have begun the design of the metal transfer
process facility (MTPF) in which the fourth metal
transfer experiment (MTE-4) will be carried out. This
experiment, which will use salt flow rates that are § to
10% of those required for processing a 1000-MW(e)
MSBR, has several primary purposes:

liner in which rare earths will be accumulated in a
lithium-bismuth solution having a volume of about 100
liters; and a hydrofluorinator that has a volume of
about 150 liters and consists of a graphite crucible
enclosed in a stainless steel vessel.

The conceptual designs of the three-stage. salt-metal
contactor and its containment vessel (see Figs. 18.10
and 18.11) have been completed. Fuel carrier salt
(72-16-12 mole % LiF-BeF,-ThF,) that contains rare-
earth fluorides will be circulated between the fluoride
salt surge tank and three compartments that are on one
side of the central partition in the salt-metal contactor.
The fluoride salt will be fed to one of the compart-
ments and will flow through the remaining compart-
ments in sequence. At the same time, LiCl will be
circulated between the vessel containing the lithium-
bismuth solution in which the rare earths will be
accumulated and the remaining three compartments of
the salt-metal contactor. The LiCl will be fed to one of
the compartments and will flow countercurrent to the

fluoride salt in the three adjacent compartments. The

two salt streams are prevented from mixing by a captive

- pool of bismuth in the bottom of each pair of

compartments which constitutes a physical mass trans-
fer stage.

In each of these stages, the bismuth, which will
contain reductant, will be circulated from one side of
the central partition to the other. However, no mixing
of bismuth between any of the physical stages will
occur. At operating temperature (640°C), the vapor
pressure of LiCl is. appreciable (about 0.5 mm Hg), and
a means for preventing transfer of LiCl to the fluoride
salt by vapor transfer is required. It is also necessary to
prevent the mixing. of the two salt streams by entrain-

ment of salt mist in the gas space above the salt-metal

contactor. Both of these requirements are met by the

use of a 4-in.-deep slot around the LiCl compartments .

that will contain molten bismuth, A metal skirt will be
attached to the upper part of the containment vessel
and will extend into the bismuth pool in order to
provide a seal between the gas space above the fluoride
and chloride salts. :

The hydrofluorinator will be used periodically to
purify the fluoride salt and to return rare earths that
have accumulated in the lithium-bismuth solution to

‘the fluoride salt. This will allow periodic adjustment of

the lithium concentration in the lithium-bismuth solu-
tion and will increase the range of process conditions
that can be covered.

We are presently discussing the conceptual design
with a graphite manufacturer in order to ensure the
optimum design from the standpoints of ease of
fabrication and accepted design technology for graphite

vessels. Additional information is required concerning
the compatibility of various grades of graphite and
bismuth solutions containing reductant. After these
questions have been satisfactorily answered, we will
continue work on the design of the MTPF. Operation of
the facility is expected to begin in FY 1974 and to
continue for one to two years.

18.5 DEVELOPMENT OF MECHANICALLY
"AGITATED SALT-METAL CONTACTORS

H.O. Weeren ~ L. E. McNeese

Experimentally determined mass transfer coefficients
for the stirred-interface type of contactor cell such as
that used in metal transfer experiment MTE-3 have
been reported in the literature and correlated in various
ways. Most of this experimental work has been done
with partially miscible solvent-water systems that have
been operated at Reynolds numbers almost an order of
magnitude lower than those expected in the MTE-3
‘system. Under such circumstances; the extrapolation of
available correlations becomes a somewhat doubtful
exercise.

A review of the suggested correlations indicated that
the variables of greatest significance in correlating mass
transfer between different. fluids were probably the
surface tension and the kinematic viscosity (t1/p). These
properties of the water-mercury system are generally

close to the same properties of the molten salt—bismuth
system; thus the water-mercury system was chosen for
experimental mass transfer determinations in the belief
that extrapolation of the values obtained would be
more believable than with any other system.
The overall mass transfer coefficient was determined
for the transfer of silver from a dilute AgNO, solution
into the mercury phase. A simplified form of the
stirred-interface contactor was used in the first experi-
ments. The equipment used consisted of a 6-in.-diam
circular cell in which sufficient water and mercury to
produce a 2.2-in.-deep layer of each of the phases were
present. The agitator consisted of two 3-in.-diam
paddles (each having four straight blades) that were
located on a common shaft about 0.75 in. from the
water-mercury interface. The AgNO; concentration was
- determined at intervals by titration of samples against
an NaCl solution. The rate of change of the AgNO;
concentration was then used to calculate the overall
mass transfer coefficient. The individual mass transfer
coefficients were calculated from the overall coeffi-
cient. :
The experimental results are plotted in Fig. 18.12 in

the form suggested by Lewis. The general range of

experimental values reported by several investigators
using various solvent-water systems is indicated, and the
experimental values obtained from the water-mercury
system are shown at the upper right. This plot indicates
that extrapolation of the Lewis correlation is a valid

procedure, even over such a wide range of Reynolds
numbers.

- The figure also shows the Reynolds numbers that will
probably be obtained at the various salt-bismuth inter-
faces in experiment MTE-3. These values are not
appreciably different from the Reynolds numbers of
the water-mercury system. This suggests that the mass

transfer coefficients that will be experimentally deter-

mined in the MTE-3 system will be reasonably close to
the previously used coefficients that were obtained by
extrapolation of the Lewis correlation. We believe that
the mass transfer performance will be strongly depen-
dent .on cell geometry, and we plan to carry out
additional studies in order to optimize the cell design
for future salt-metal contactors.

18.6 REDUCTIVE EXTRACTION ENGINEERING
STUDIES

 B. A.Hannaford W.M. Woods
D. D. Sood

. We have continued mass transfer experiments in
which the rate of transfer of ®?Zr and 227U from
molten salt to bismuth is measured by adding these
materials to the salt phase prior to contacting the salt

_with bismuth containing reductant in a packed column.

Three experiments were carried out in which only ?7 Zr

 
 

 

was used. A total of 19 to 46% of the *7Zr was

observed to transfer to the bismuth, and the resulting
HTU. values ranged from 4.3 to 4.7 ft. In the final
experiment, both ®*7Zr and 237U were used. The
fractions of these materials that transferred to the
bismuth were 14 and 15% for °7Zr and 2370,

respectively, and the resulting HTU values were 3.6 and
© 4.6 ft respectively.

System Modifications and Maintenance

During the preparations for additional ®7Zr tracer

experiments, a series of minor leaks led to the replace-

" ment of several transfer lines and the removal of the

filters from the bismuth and salt transfer lines exiting

“from the treatment vessel. A leak that occurred

downstream of the salt filter appeared to be due to
external air oxidation. All of the vessel-connecting lines
that were part of the original installation were replaced.

* The dip tube attached to the bismuth transfer line was

found to be plugged with an iron deposit and was

"replaced. Makeup salt was added to the treatment

vessel, and most of the salt was transferred to the salt
feed tank. The remaining salt and bismuth were treated
with 30% HF-H, in order to oxidize the iron present in
the bismuth into the salt heel overlying the bismuth.
The salt heel was sampled and discarded. Both the
bismuth and the salt filters were permanently removed
from the system when cracks were observed in the weld
joints attaching them to transfer lines. A small salt leak
occurred in the line connecting the salt head tank to the
column, and a similar failure appeared below the
flowing bismuth sampler. All of the lines connecting the
salt head tank, the column, the specific gravity pot, and
the flowing bismuth sampler were replaced with steel
tubing coated with nickel aluminide in order to evaluate
the performance of the coating for protecting the steel
from air oxidation.

Concurrently with the maintenance work, several
attempts were made to determine the concentrations of
reductant in the bismuth phase in the treatment vessel

through the use of a beryllium or uranium electrode.

The results were only marginally successful; the beryl-
lium had a tendency to reduce uranium from the salt,
and a uranium electrode using a uranium-bismuth

solution and a salt bridge exhibited excessive scatter in -

the variation of emf with changes in reductant concen-
tration, as determined by reductant addition and
chemical analyses of the salt and bismuth.

Mass Transfer Runs Using ® 7 Zr Tracer

Severdl changes were made to reduce the scatter in
 97Zr counting data reported previously.® These in-

228

clude: (1) the use of a deeper submergence (about 1 in.)
of the sample capsules within the flowing bismuth
sampler and (2) a modification of the sampler housing
to maintain a leak-tight seal on the sampler capillary
tubing at all times as a means of prohibiting the entry
of air to the housing. In order to buffer the system with
respect to the presence of trace oxidants in the argon
cover gas and possible release of HF from the graphite
crucible, the uranium inventory of the system was
increased from 0.135 to 0.315 g-mole. After bismuth
and salt had been circulated through the system to
remove oxide from the new transfer lines, the bismuth
and salt were treated with a 25 mole % HF-H, mixture
for 15 hr. This treatment was followed by hydrogen
sparging at 12 scfh for 8 hr.and argon sparging for 60
hr. Lithium-bismuth alloy containing 1 g-equivalent of
lithium was then added to the treatment vessel.
Uranium analyses of bismuth and salt showed a
uranium distribution coefficient of 0.30, which indi-
cated that about two-thirds -of the lithium in the
lithium-bismuth alloy was oxidized before being added
to the treatment vessel and/or was consumed by a side

“reaction in the treatment vessel. Additional lithium-

bismuth alloy was added to the treatment vessel, and a
nontracer run was made in order to bring bismuth and
salt in all parts of the system to near-equilibrium
conditions. About 15 mCi of *7 ZrO, was added to the
salt feed tank, and mass transfer run ZTR-7 was carried
out. Flowing bismuth samples showed remarkably little
scatter in °7Zr activity, with six of seven samples
varying less than 5% from the average of all samples.

This indicates that earlier difficulties with sampling the --

flowing bismuth stream have been alleviated. The
material balance on ®7Zr tracer was excellent: 95% on
flowing stream samples and 99% on the total inventory
of °7Zr from the beginning of run ZTR-7 to the end of
the subsequent run (ZTR-8), which was carried out
with feed streams that were essentially in equilibrium,
The calculated HTU for zirconium in ZTR:7 was 4.3 ft,
as shown in Table 18.2. ’

In order to increase the zirconium distribution coeffi-

cient (Dz,) to a suitable value for run ZTR-9, a total of
500 g of lithium-bismuth alloy (~1.25 g-equivalent of
lithium) was added to the treatment vessel. Operation
of the equipment was smooth during the run, although

an increased pressure drop in the salt overflow line

required -that the top of ‘the column be operated at an
argon overpressure equal to 12 in. HO. In order to
obtain precise values for the net sample weights, the
samples were cut open and the contents were drilled

out on a small lathe. Salt was quantitatively removed
from the samples by this technique; complete removal
of the bismuth required a brief exposure to 6 N HNO,
after most of the bismuth had been drilled from the
sampler. The ®7Zr tracer balance in ZTR-9 was 127%
based on flowing stream samples and 104% based on
tank samples. The ®7 Zr activities in the flowing stream

samples were constant to within 8% of their average for

salt and within 2% for bismuth. The calculated HTU
value was 4.6 ft.

_ Preparatory to the next tracer experiment, a 1. 05-g
bar of beryllium was dissolved in the treatment vessel in
order to increase Dz,. Following a routine operation in
which the bismuth and salt were circulated through the
equipment in order to bring the salt and bismuth in the
entire system to the same concentrations, *7Zr was
added to the salt phase and tracer experiment ZTR-10
was carried out. The flowing stream samples were
constant to within 8% of their average for salt and to
within 7% for the bismuth. The calculated HTU was 4.7
ft, as shown in Table 18.2.

Temperature Dependence of Dz,, Dy

Uranium analyses for the flowing stream samples
taken during experiments ZTR-9 and ZTR-10 showed
that about 25% of the uranium transferred from the
bismuth to the salt during the experiments. Since

. pre-equilibrated (at 600°C) phases were contacted in

the column, such transfer was not expected. Exami-
nation of the temperature data from the run showed
that column temperatures were generally about 50 to
75°C higher than the treatment vessel temperature.
Calculations of Dy and Dz; made for various reductant
concentrations and temperatures ranging from 550 to
700°C indicate that, at reductant concentrations used
for ZTR9 and ZTR-10, the uranium distribution

coefficient decreases significantly at the higher tempera-

tures but that the change in Dg, is less than 10% for a
50°C change in temperature.

An experiment was performed in order to verify the
calculated “effect of temperature variations on the
distribution coefficients for uranium and zirconium.
Prior to the experiment, the salt and bismuth were
hydrofluorinated to remove oxide impurities and were
then sparged for 24 hr with hydrogen and for 60 hr
with argon. Reductant was subsequently added to the
bismuth electrolytically by using a consumable beryl
lium anodé and a 1.5-V potential that was applied
across the anode and the bismuth pool. After dissolu-
tion of 1 g-equivalent of beryllium and following a
20-hr “equilibration period, analyses of the phases
indicated that no uranium had transferred to the
bismuth and that the added reductant had been
consumed by impurities (probably FeF,). A second
addition of beryllium was made, followed by the
addition of about 10 mCi of ®7Zr to the treatment
vessel in order to determine the zirconium distribution
coefficient and to permit the measurement of Dz, as a
function of temperature. Zirconium distribution coeffi-
cient values obtained at 600, 620, 640, and 680°C were
0.88, 0.89, 1.05, and 1,06 respectively. The weak
dependence of Dz, upon temperature indicated that
the nonisothermal condition that existed in the column

-during runs ZTR-9 and -10 introduced a negligible error

in the calculated mass transfer performance.

Mass Transfer Experiments with 237U
and ® Zr Tracers

Preparatory to carrying out mass transfer experiment
UZTR-1, ®7 Zr tracer was added to the treatment vessel
in order to permit determination of the zirconium
distribution coefficient. The resulting salt and bismuth

© samples indicated a Dz; of about 0.45, which was

satisfactory. Following the usual equilibration run,

about 5S mCi of 237U and 10 mCi of ®7Zr were added
to the salt feed tank, and the experiment was carried
out. Data from the run are summarized in Table 18.3. A
post-run measurement of Dz, indicated that no change
in the zirconium distribution coefficient had occurred
during the run. The reported HTU values were calcu-

lated from tank samples, for which the tracer balances .
ranged from 100 to 106%. The HTU value for zirco-

nium was significantly: higher than the value of 1 ft
reported earlier® for a ®7Zr tracer experiment made
under similar conditions. The recent results are proba-
bly more reliable, since the distribution coefficient was
measured both before and after the experiment.

Following the post-run equilibration of bismuth and
salt in the treatment vessel and sampling to obtain ®7 Zr

and 237U distribution data, a 1.93-g beryllium rod was

electrolytically dissolved in the salt to increase Dy to

near 1.0. Periodic sampling of the equilibrated phases -

was begun in order to monitor the uranium distribution
coefficient over an extended period of time. The

samples were analyzed by counting the 0.208-MeV

gamma emission from 237U (ty), for *37U = 6.75
days). This allowed more information to be obtained on
the rate at which reductant is lost from the bismuth in
the treatment vessel.

18.7 DESIGN OF THE REDUCTIVE-EXTRACTION
PROCESS FACILITY

W.M. Woods  W. F. Schaffer, Jr. L.E. McNeese

We have initiated design and development work for’
the reductive-extraction process facility (REPF), which
will allow testing and ‘development of equipment
suitable for use in a full-scale protactinium- removal

. process based on fluorination—reductive extraction. A

preliminary examination and conceptual design for the

6. B. A. Hannaford et al., MSR Program Semiannu. Progr.

Rep. Aug. 31, 1971, ORNL4728, p. 213.

i

system have been partially completed. The facility will

allow “operation of all steps of the reductive-extraction
process with salt flow rates as high as about 25% of
those required for processing a 1000-MW(e) MSBR. A

flow diagram for the facility is shown in Fig. 18.13. .

MSBR fuel carrier salt (72-16-12 mole % LiF-BeF,-
ThF,) containing ® 7 Zr tracer and 0.003 to 0.01 mole %
UF, (the uranium concentration expected after fluori-

"nation of MSBR fuel salt) will be withdrawn from the

salt surge tank and will be fed countercurrent to a
bismuth stream ‘containing 0.002 mole fraction of
lithium in a 2-in.-ID, 6-ft-long packed column, where
part of the uranium and zirconium will be extracted
into the bismuth phase. The salt and bismuth streams
leaving the column will then be fed to a continuous

hydrofluorinator, where the uranium, zirconium, thor- .

ium, and lithium in the bismuth will be converted to
fluorides, which will subsequently transfer to the salt
phase. Thus the salt stream leaving the hydrofluorinator

. will have the same composition as the salt entering the

extraction column. The bismuth stream leaving the
hydrofluorinator will be combined with the desired
amount of reductant and returned to the extraction
column. Provision will be made for sampling the salt
and bismuth streams throughout the facility. The REPF
will operate continuously, in contrast to the semicon-
tinuous mode of operation for the present reductive
extraction test facility (see Sect. 18.6). The facility will
have the capability for reaching the flooding capacity of
the packed column throughout a range of salt-bismuth

flow rate ratios from 0.1 to 15; this includes salt and

bismuth flow rates ranging from 0.5 to 3.25 liters/min
and 0.2 to 2.5 liters/min respectively. The facility will

be used to develop multistage salt-bismuth contactors,

salt-bismuth hydrofluorinators, and other equipment
items required for the removal of protactinium from
MSBR fuel salt by reductive extraction. Data will be
obtained on materials of construction, corrosion, and
the rate of mass transfer of uranium, zirconium,

thorium, and lithium between salt and bismuth phases;

other information required for the evaluation and
design of protactinium removal systems will also be

- obtained. The materials of construction for the facility

will consist largely of graphite and molybdenum and
will be enclosed in steel for protection from oxidation.

fluorinator requires a heat source in the molten salt
which is not subject to attack by gaseous fluorine. We
have previously” simulated high-frequency induction

“heating of molten salt in a frozen-wall fluorinator by

making measurements of heat generation in aqueous
electrolytes contained in equipment similar to a fluori-
nator. The measurements indicated that sufficient heat
could probably be generated in molten salts if a suitable
means could be found for introducing an induction coil

into the vessel and supporting it during operation. An
experiment was designed to’ test one means for intro-
ducing the coil. Operational difficulties (which are
described later) and the narrow range of acceptable
operating conditions have prompted reexamination of
autoresistance heating using 60-Hz power. Two series of
experiments for study of autoresistance heating were
performed and are also described.

Molten-Salt Induction Heating Experiment

The equipment for the molten-salt induction heating
experiment was described previously.” Before the test

 
 

 

232

vessel was heated and filled with salt, preliminary

experiments were necessary to determine if 85 A (the
current required for operation under the design condi-
tions) could be driven through the coil.’

. The induction coil was connected directly to the

coaxial transmission cable, which was connected to the
generator through a transformer that reduced the
terminal voltage of the generator (~19,000 V, peak) to
an estimated peak voltage of 3000. In the first attempt
to. operate the system, a current of 50 A was driven
through the coil; however, arcing occurred between the

S4-in. coil lead and a %-in. compression fitting, at the .

point where the high-voltage coil lead penetrated the
vessel. Although Teflon insulators had been used to
prevent actual contact of the tubing with this fitting, a
gas-filled gap existed between the tubing and the fitting.

_ Since the arcing destroyed the lower Teflon insulator,

the insulators were replaced by longer ones which
completely filled the space between the tubing and the
grounded vessel with Teflon (a dielectric); this measure

served to prevent arcing at this point.

After the Teflon insulators had been replaced, a
second attempt to drive the required current through
the coil was made. In this test, a current of 90 A was
attained; however, arcing occurred between the first
turn of. the top coil and the high-voltage lead at the
point of closest approach, partially melting the coil. No

arcing occurred at points protected by the new Teflon

insulators. The arcing in both preliminary runs can be

attributed to the use of argon as the inert gas in the

vessel. Argon has a dielectric strength only about 28%
of that of nitrogen. The spacing at the points of arcing
was such that, if 3000 V were impressed on the coil
leads, electric field strengths high enough to cause
dielectric breakdown of argon would indeed be present.
If nitrogen had been used as the cover gas in the vessel,
no arcing would have occurred. Fluorine should have a
high dielectric strength, since highly electronegative
gaseous materials quench the electron avalanche that
precedes dielectric breakdown.

Although the difficulties experienced thus far show
nothing fundamentally wrong with induction heating as
a method for generating heat in the molten salt of a
frozen-wall fluorinator, the complexity of the required

electrical equipment and the narrow range of acceptable

operating conditions are distinct disadvantages. There-
fore, we are reconsidering autoresistance heating and
have performed several experiments to study this
method of heating. =

Autoresistance Heating

- The advantages of autoresistance heating over induc-

tion heating include a less complicated power supply,

an easier means of controlling heat generation rates, a -

wider range of acceptable operating conditions, and a
simpler method for introducing the flowing salt stream
into the fluorinator. The disadvantages stem from the
introduction of electrodes into the salt, since these
electrodes are subject to corrosion from electrical
processes. However, the problems. associated with corro-
sion are not believed to be severe.

Two series of autoresistance heating experiments have
been performed. A photograph of the test vessel used in
the first series is shown in Fig. 18.14. This vessel was
made from 2%in. sched 40 nickel pipe and had a
3-ft-long vertical test section. The high-voltage electrode

"(50 to 100 V) was located in a side arm that branched

from. the top of the test section. The grounded
electrode was the portion of the vessel wall below the
test section, In an actual fluorinator, molten salt would
be fed. into the side arm containing the high-voltage

“electrode. A 6-in.-diam gas-liquid disengagement section

was provided above the test section.
"The equipment was designed to operate with a
current of about 15 A through the salt. The current was
held constant by manual adjustment of an autotrans-
former. Under design conditions, about 860 W would
have been generated in the molten salt (corresponding
to a specific heat generation rate of 9.8 kW per cubic
foot of molten salt). Cooling of the test section was
accomplished by conduction through the thermal insu-
lation and natural convection to the cell air. These
conditions should have allowed a Y%-in.-thick salt film
to be maintained in the test section with the vessel wall
temperature about 20°C below the liquidus tempera-
ture of the salt (458°C for 66-34 mole % LiF-BeF,).
Three types of operation were studied with the
equipment described above. In the first type, the
equipment was operated as designed. In the second and
third types, an electrode was inserted through a nozzle

at the top of the gas-liquid disengaging section. In the

second type of operation, the salt level was in the
vertical test section below the upper side arm junction;
in the third type of operation, the salt level was raised
into the gas-liquid disengaging section. -

The same procedure was followed during each run.
The temperature of the test section was adjusted to a
temperature just above the liquidus temperature

(458°C); the external heaters on the test section were
* turned off, and the salt was allowed to freeze on the

vessel wall in the test section. Current was then passed
through the salt to heat the salt internally.

In each run the measured resistance of the current
path was of the order of 0.1 to.0.3 § during periods of
high heat generation. The calculated resistance for the
proper current. path is. greater than 1 £. During
 

 

I

formation of a frozen film, the resistance (as measured
during short periods with low current and voltage) rose
as high as 0.8 2 but would drop to the lower values
under prolonged periods with high current. In runs with

the salt Jevel raised into the gas-liquid disengaging
section, heat generation rates up to 600 W were
achieved; all of the heat was apparently generated in the
vicinity of the upper electrode.

In order to determine the reason why the current was
not traveling the desired path, a new vessel that would
allow easier observation of the electrode and the frozen
salt was designed and built. This test vessel (see Fig.
18.15) was made from 6-in. sched 40 nickel pipe and
had a 4-ft vertical test section. No upper side arm was"

.provided for thé high-voltage electrode; instead, the

electrodes passed directly into the test section through
a nozzle in the top flange. A lower side arm made from
4-in, sched 40 nickel pipe was placed near the bottom
of the test vessel to aid in adjusting the liquid level at
the top of the test section. Cooling was accomplished
by conduction through % in. of insulation and natural
convection to the cell air. A flange with two sight
glasses was installed in order to permit observation of
the interior of the vessel during operation.
Two.experiments have been carried out in the second
test vessel. In the first experiment, the vessel was cooled
(by natural convection to the ambient air) for 1 hr in
order to freeze salt on the vessel wall in the test section.

Resistance measurements made during the cooldown

period indicated resistances of 0.05 £ with no frozen
material on the walls and 0.1 £2 after 1 hr of cooling.
The minimum calculated resistance, assuming complete
coverage of the vessel wall by frozen salt in the 4-ft test
section, is 3.7 2. In the second test, the vessel was
cooled for 1 hr, drained, and allowed to cool to room
temperature. The resistance measured just prior to
draining was 0.2 £2. The top flange was removed in
order to visually examine the frozen salt layer.

The frozen salt layer had a mean thickness of
approximately ¥ 4 in.; however, its crystalline texture
was unlike the frozen layers observed in earlier frozen-
wall studies with a gas-salt contactor or with electro-
lytic cells. Rather than the smooth solid-liquid interface
seen in these studies,®? the frozen salt had dendrites
up to % in. long over the surface of the test section; no
portion had a smooth appearance.

With low heat fluxes, it is believed that the frozen
material forms slowly at relatively few nucleation sites
and large crystals grow from these sites. The liquid left
behind in the vicinity of the crystals would have a
slightly lower liquidus temperature than material ini-

tially present. This would allow electrically conducting
liquid to be interspersed between the crystals. The
resulting salt layer would thus not be electrically
insulating. The appearance .of the frozen salt left on the
vessel walls is in agreement with this hypothesis.

With higher heat fluxes, the wall temperature would
be low enough to freeze the lowermelting liquid
remaining after initial precipitation of some solid. Also,
the higher temperature. gradient associated with the
higher heat fluxes should prevent formation of a
dendritic . structure. Both effects should lead to a
completely solid (and therefore electrically insulating)
frozen layer. ;

After a few additional tests, we will modify the
system to allow forced cooling and will install a larger
autoresistance power supply in order to operate the test
equipment with higher heat fluxes.

18.9 ENGINEERING STUDIES;
OF URANIUM OXIDE PRECIPITATION

M.1.Bell D.D.Sood L.E.McNeese

Operation of a facility for performing engineering

studies of uranium oxide precipitation was continued

during this report period.1® Eleven experiments have
been performed in the facility, and the oxide precipita-
tion process continues to appear to be an attractive
alternative to fluorination for removing uranium from
fuel salt that is free of protactinium. In these experi-
ments, we observed the effects of the salt temperature,
the gas feed rate, and the water concentration in the gas
on the oxide precipitation rate. The sequence of
operations during an experiment was.as follows:

1. Contact of the salt containing UF, with an argon-
water gas mixture in the precipitator in order to
precipitate oxides of uranium and thorium. Samples
of the oxide and salt phases were obtained during
and after this step.

2. Separation of the oxide from the salt by allowing
the oxide to settle to the bottom of the precipitator.

3. Transfer of about 90% of the salt slowly from the
precipitator to .the salt feed tank in order to
minimize the quantity of oxide transferred.

ployed to compute the composition of the oxide and
the uranium concentration in the salt, assuming equilib-
rium bétween the salt and oxide. The equilibrium
relationship places a lower limit of about 1600 wt ppm
on the concentration of uranium in the salt that can be
achieved in a single equilibrium stage without the
precipitation of large quantities of ThO,. When this
concentration is reached, further addition of oxide

‘results mainly in the solid becoming richer in thoria,

Results of the first eight. experiments are summarized i in
Table 18.4.

Experiments were conducted at temperatures from
540 to 630°C, and the composition of the argon-water
mixture was varied from 10 to 35% water. Only a slight
increase in reaction rate with an increase in temperature
was observed; however, the rate of precipitation appears
to vary in direct proportion to the rate at which water
is supplied to the system. The values for the water
utilization observed to date have been uniformly low
(about 10 to 15%) and do not vary with the composi-
tion of the gas stream. The utilization appears to be
simply a function of the residence time of the gas in the
salt; thus higher utilization values. should be obtained
by increasing the contact time of the gas with the salt.
The initial uranium concentration in the salt was about
1 wt % in the first seven experiments, and 50 to 90% of
the uranium was precipitated as oxide in most of the
experiments. Table 18.4 shows the quantity of HF gas
collected in each experiment, which is directly related
by the stoichiometry of the reaction to the quantity of
oxide formed. From the quantity of oxide formed, the

‘equilibrium data of Bamberger and Baes!! were em-

and in minimal precipitation of uranium. In several
experiments, the measured uranium concentrations in
the salt samples agree fairly closely with the values
calculated by ‘assuming that the salt and oxide phases
are in equilibrium. There is a trend in some of the early
experiments for the uranium analyses to show slightly
higher uranium concentrations than are calculated by
assuming equilibrium; and, in’ the last two experiments,

‘the measured uranium concentrations are below those

calculated by assuming equilibrium.
The salt samples obtained from the feed tank showed

‘uranium concentrations that are only slightly higher

than those’ measured in: the precipitator vessel. Suffi-
cient data are not available at this time to determine

“whether the higher concentrations in the receiver tank

were the result of entrainment of a small amount of

-oxide or due to the. salt heel -in the receiver vessel

(which contains. some UF,), but information will be

.obtained ‘in the next few runs to resolve this uncer-

tainty. Also shown in Table 18.4 are the compositions
of the UO,-ThO; solid solutions that were observed at
the conclusion of each experiment. All of the samples
contain about. 90% UO, even though, at the lower
uranium concentrations inthe salt, the solid in equilib- -
rium with the salt would contain 50% UO, or less.
Typical results of analyses of oxide samples obtained
through experiment OP-8 are shown in Table 18.5. In

‘general, the oxide samples contain more than one
face-centered cubic phase - a principal phase that is
rich in UO, and one or more additional phases that are
rich in ThO,. In many cases, more than 90% of the
solid consists of a phase that is about 90% UO,, and
less than 10% of the solid consists of a thorium-rich
phase. Apparently, a minimum of 5 to 10% of the
precipitate will consist of a phase that is rich in ThO,,
which is believed to be the result of inadequate mixing
of the salt in the present equipment. The experimen-
_ tally observed oxide compositions are compared with
the composition of the solid solutions calculated to be
in equilibrium with the UF, concentration in the salt in
each experiment. The average UO, content of the
precipitates is 80 + 10%, even in those samples where
the oxide in equilibrium with the salt is much lower

(experiments OP-7 and OP-8).

. These results are plotted in Fig. 18.16, which shows
the ThO, /UO, ratio in oxide samples taken during the
first eight experiments as a function of the uranium
concentration in the salt. The data are plotted along
with the values given by the equilibrium relation of
Bamberger and Baes, which predicts that, at low UF,
.concentrations in the salt, the ratio of ThO, to UO; in
the solid becomes quite large. The data of Table 18.5
(the points shown with error bars) agree fairly closely
with the equilibrium calculation at high concentrations
of UF, in the salt but fall well below the equilibrium
curve at low uranium mole fractions. The results for a

- ‘number ‘of other samples, in which- only one face-
- centered cubic solid could be identified, are also shown
in Fig. 18.16. These samples are of interest because, in

most cases, the principal solid phase contains a much -

higher fraction of UQ, than is calculated from the

equilibrium expression. These results have led to a

nonequilibrium precipitation model in which UOQ,-

ThO, solid solutions are precipitated that are in
equilibrium with the salt at the moment of formation,
but in which the solid solutions, once formed, do not

-rapidly reequilibrate. Thus, solid solutions that are

formed early in the precipitation process, and that

contain 90 to 95% UO,, are still present during the

final stages of precipitation when the solid solutions

being formed contain much less UO,. A curve repre-
senting this model of the precipitation process is also
shown in Fig. 18.16. Based on this model, 99% of the
uranium could be precipitated from the salt in one stage
as a solid containing 85% UQ, (which is acceptable).
The experimental data indicate that the oxides actually
observed have a slightly lower UO, content, which is
believed to ‘be the result of precipitation of a thorium-
rich phase due to inadequate mixing of the salt phase.
However, the compositions of the solid solutions which
have been observed are still well within the range of
those required for operation of a flowsheet using a

_ single-stage UO, precipitator.

-Table 18.6 shows the uranium material balances that
were made for experiments OP-2 through OP-7. The
inventory of uranium remaining in the salt is calculated
using analyses of salt samples and the known inventory
of salt in the system. The uranium concentration in the
solid is obtained from x-ray analysis of oxide ‘samples,
and the total amount of oxide in the system is
calculated from the amount of HF evolved. The
uranium inventory calculated by the material balances
for these experiments was found ‘to agree quite well
with the known uranium inventory in ‘the system,
which was 0.290 mole. This agreement is considered to
be a reasonable check on the consistency of the
experimental procedures and the analytical techniques.

Two experiments (OP-10 and OP-11) were performed

in which a large fraction of the uranium in the system

was precipitated and in which the precipitate was
allowed to remain in contact with the salt for a period
of about one week in order to observe the rate of
equilibration of the two phases. Experiment OP-10 was

. performed with the salt temperature at ‘550°C, and

experiment OP-11 was carried out with the salt temper-
ature at 620°C. In each experiment, gas was circulated
through the draft tube in order to promote contact of
the salt and oxide. Samples of salt and oxide were

obtained at intervals during the experiments. No detect-
able increase was noted in the uranium concentration in
the salt in either case, and little or no equilibration of
the two phases occurred. oo

Samples of oxide obtained during experiment OP-11
have been washed free of salt and examined petrograph-
ically. Thus far, the samples examined reveal that
particles with a high UO, content average 40 + 10 gin
size and that these particles are consistently larger than
particles with a high ThO, content. More detailed
information concerning the size - distribution of the
precipitate will be obtained from future samples. The
slow rate of reequilibration and the particle sizes
observed in experiments OP-10 and OP-11 continue to
make the oxide precipitation process appear attractive.
Future experiments dealing with uranium oxide precipi-
tation will be designed to obtain further information
concerning - the size distribution. of the solids, to
determine the quantity of oxide that is entrained during.
decantation, and to study the behavior of the system
using hydrogen-water gas mixtures: as the source of
oxide. oe

The present facility also lends itself to the initial
investigation of the behavior of protactinium and rare
earths in systems of engineering interest. An experiment
is planned in which niobium will be used as a substitute
for protactinium and in.which 233 Pa tracer will also be
present. It is expected that such an experiment will
provide information on the suitability of niobium as a
stand-in for protactinium and that it will be possible to
demonstrate the selective precipitation of niobium and
protactinium oxides in systems where uranium is
present at MSBR concentrations. Experiments are being
considered in which rare earths will be added to the
system; in these experiments, we will attempt to
demonstrate that UO, can be precipitated from fuel
salt without the attendant precipitation of rare earth
oxides: - .

18.10 DESIGN OF A PROCESSING MATERIALS
TEST STAND AND THE MOLYBDENUM
REDUCTIVE EXTRACTION EQUIPMENT

E. L. Nicholson w. F. Schaffer, Jr.

Design of the loop components continued, and
fabrication of some of the structural parts of the test
stand was started. Specific accomplishments include:
design of the expansion loops in the molybdenum
tubing; completion of preliminary piping drawings and
the construction of a full-size mockup of the loop;
design of the molybdenum equipment support system;
design of a field assembly jig and a handling system so
that the loop can be field assembled in Building 4508
and transported to Building 4505 for operation; design
of the containment vessel, the seal-welded flange, the
freeze valve, and the transition joint nozzles.

Calculations were completed and the design was
prepared for the loops to accommodate thermal expan-

-sion in molybdenum tubes for the instrument purge,

gas-lift supply, and transfer lines. Tests, by the Metals
‘and Ceramics Division, of %-in. molybdenum tubes
brazed into a stainless steel socket and loaded as small
cantilever beams showed that the molybdenum ex-
hibited brittle failure at a stress of 67,500 psi. An
allowable design tensile stress of one-tenth of this value
(6750 psi) was used for calculating the size of the
expansion loops and for all other stress calculations
involving molybdenum. The following conditions must
be met to ensure satisfactory performance of the
expansion loops: :

1. The gas entering the molybdenum tube must be
preheated to at least 300°F. This preheating also
ensures that all the molybdenum tubing will be
heated above the brittle-to-ductile transition temper-
ature.

2. The molybdenum lines inside the containment vessel
must be coated with a high thermal emissivity
coating to a point beyond the ‘expansion loop to
promote rapid heating of the inlet gas in the
molybdenum tube to the loop operating tempera-
ture, thus minimizing the amount of thermal expan-
sion accommodation required for each line.

3. The gas flow to each line must be limited to about
1.5 times the normal maximum flow.

Alternative designs were attempted in which none of

the preceding three restrictions were imposed (i.e., the
" done. ‘An existing 16-ft-tall multilevel platform was to

maximum accidental misoperation case). However, the
required expansion loops were too large to be accom-
modated in the available space in the containment
vessel.

Preliminary piping drawings were prepared, and the
Metals and Ceramics Division constructed a full-scale
mockup of the molybdenum equipment and piping.
The mockup has been quite useful for improving the
piping arrangement and for ensuring that sufficient
space for the fabrication operations is provided around

each shop- or field-welded and -brazed tubing joint. We

are now preparing detailed piping drawings from the
mockup arrangement. The overall height of the molyb-
denum system from the underside of the containment
vessel flange to the lowest point on the molybdenum
tubing is slightly greater than 16.7 ft.

An equipment alignment column, attached to the
underside of the containment vessel flange and extend-
ing down the full height of the loop, is required to

“brace the equipment and to position guide rings for
* insertion of the loop in the. containment vessel. A

molybdenum rod was considered for this alignment
column to eliminate any differential thermal expansion
and, consequently, any binding of the equipment
supports. However, a rod of sufficient rigidity to
prevent excessive bending of the molybdenum compo-
nents during insertion of the loop in the containment
vessel would have been very expensive. A bar having a
diameter greater than or equal to 2.1 in. and a length of
17 ft would have been required; a single piece of
molybdenum tubing of sufficient rigidity was consid-
ered to be completely out of the question. Stainless
steel pipe (2'% in. sched 80) was selected for the
alignment column. The molybdenum equipment will be
hung on small-diameter molybdenum rods that will
extend to the containment vessel flange and will be
braced to the alignment column by horizontal molyb-
denum sheet braces that will be anchored to clamps on
the column. During fabrication and the subsequent
erection of the loop to the vertical position, these
clamps will be locked on the alignment column. The
clamps will then be loosened before final installation of
the loop by removing cylindrical shims so that the
stainless steel column can expand freely in the axial
direction without binding on the clamps and thereby
stressing the molybdenum components. Drawings have
been prepared for the equipment support system.

The original plan was to fabricate the molybdenum
vessels and piping subassemblies in electron-beam vac-

uum chambers and inert-gas welding glove boxes in

Building 4508 and to carry the fabricated items to
Building 4505, where the field assembly work would be

be converted to a vertical assembly area in Building
4505. The problems associated with this method for
field assembly were numerous, and a more satisfactory

assembly concept has evolved and has been adopted. A
rigid transportable field assembly jig, which will allow
the field assembly work to be done in Building 4508,
has been designed; the jig will be used in the horizontal
position, and all of the molybdenum components will

~ be at essentially tabletop level. Temporary tubing and

equipment supports and protective covers will be
installed; and the jig, after assembly of the molyb-
denum equipment, will be transported to Building 4505
and erected to the vertical position over cell 4A. The
molybdenum equipment will then be released from the

jig and lowered into the containment vessel. Rigging

procedures have been reviewed to ensure that several
handling problems can be solved. Fabrication of the jig,
lifting frame, trunnion bars and sockets, and the special
hatch cover for the cell has been initiated. When these
parts are available, a run of the transport and erection
procedure will be conducted, probably using the piping
mockup as a stand-in for the molybdenum system.

The seal-welded flange and containment vessel designs
have been reviewed by the Pressure Vessel Committee
and approved on a preliminary basis. Detailed design of
these components is under way, and procurement of

the necessary materials is in progress. Design of the
“molybdenum-to-stainless-steel transition joint nozzles

for the containment vessel is complete, as are the
designs of the freeze valve, the containment vessel
support, and the auxiliary platform required inside cell
4A. We expect that most of the design work for the
system will be completed in the next six-month périod.

18.11 DEVELOPMENT OF A BISMUTH-SALT
INTERFACE DETECTOR

H.O.Weeren E,L. Nicholson C.V.Dodd

An eddy-current type of detector is being devel-
oped!2 to allow detection and control of the bismuth-
salt interface in salt-metal extraction columns or me-
chanically agitated salt-metal contactors. The probe con-
sists of a ceramic form on which bifilar primary and
secondary coils are wound. Contact of the coils with
molten salt or bismuth is prevented by enclosing the
coils in a molybdenum tube. In operation, a high-fre-

quency alternating current is passed through the pri--

mary coil, -and it induces a current in the secondary
coil. The induced current is dependent on the conduc-
tivities of the materials located adjacent to the primary
and secondary coils; since the conductivities of salt and

bismuth are quite different, the induced current reflects
the presence or absence of bismuth. The principal
problem associated with this type of detector stems
from the high conductivity of molybdenum, the fabri-
cation material of the protective sheath. Two ap-
proaches for obtaining an output from the detector are
being pursued. The first is based on measuring changes
in the magnitude of the induced current; the second is
based on measuring the phase shift that occurs between
the voltage imposed on the primary coil and that which
is induced in the secondary coil.

The completed probe has been installed in a carbon-
steel test vessel; both the probe design and the test
vessel design were described previously. The test vessel
has three chambers; the upper chamber is a reservoir for

molten bismuth, the middle chamber contains the.

sheathed probe, and the lower chamber, which simu-
lates the interior of ‘the high-temperature containment
vessel for the molybdenum reductive extraction equip-
ment, contains 13 ft of high-temperature. electrical
cable in an inert atmosphere. Bismuth can be trans-
ferred via pressure between the upper and middle
chambers to vary. the level around the probe; this level
can be measured with a bubbler system and compared
with probe readings. The test assembly is shown
schematically in Fig. 18.17. :

During this report period, the test vessel was installed
and leak tested. The two upper compartments were
filled with argon, and a vacuum was maintained in the
lower compartment by means of a vacuum pump. The
vessel was heated to 625°C and treated with hydrogen
for 16 hr to reduce oxides. Bismuth (21.65 kg) was

added and treated with hydrogen for 16 hr at 625°C."

The lower compartment was then pressurized. with

-argon to 14.7 psia.
The level of bismuth around the probe (measured .

with a mercury manometer) was varied at approxi-
mately 1-in. intervals and was compared with the
output from .the level detector. This procedure was
repeated at operating temperatures ranging from 550 to
700°C in increments of 25°C. A straight-line plot was
made at each temperature, and the standard deviation
of the readings was 0.05 in. The average measured
sensitivity of all the readings was 0.866°/in., as com-
pared with the calculated value of 0.827°/in. The
average temperature coefficient over the entire tempera-

ture range varied from —0.0075°/°C (+0.009 in./°C) at-

a level of 1 in. to —0.0024°/°C (+.003 in./°C) at a level
of 12 in. A plot of the results obtained at 550 and
700°C is shown in Fig. 18.18. Assistance with the
measurements and data analysis was obtained from the
Nondestructive Testing Group of the Metals and Ceram-

"ics Division, who also assisted in the e design of the level

detector.

We plan to make measurements of the change i in
magnitude of the induced current that is caused by a
change in the liquid level in the near future, and will
repeat some of the measurements with the phase-shift
technique in order to check for long:term drift in the
readings.

19. Continuous Salt Purification
R. B. Lindauer ,

Studies of the reduction of FeF, in molten salt by
contact of the salt with hydrogen in a packed column
were continued after the packed column was replaced.
The new column is packed with % X % X %, in. wall
Raschig ring packing, which has a 32% greater void
volume than the original % 4-in.-wall packing. Other
changes, as described in the previous report,! were an
enlarged, packed liquid-deentrainment section and

modifications to the piping to improve salt flow and to
reduce the possibility of salt plugs in the vent lines. -

Before the iron fluoride reduction runs were resumed,
four argon-salt tests were made to determine the
column throughput. Although the installed rotameters
had insufficient capacity to actually flood the column,
we were able to attain flow rates that were three times
the maximum values possible with the initial column.
The pressure drop across the column was somewhat

lower than that observed. during some runs with the

earlier column, indicating that still higher flow rates are
possible.

In order to evaluate the use of ° Fe tracer rather than
colorimetric iron analyses, about 1 mCi of tracer was

added to 600 ml of molten salt to which sufficient

FeF, had been added to produce an iron concentration

of 209 ppm. The salt was then diluted, first to 1000 ml

and then to 1750 ml. After the first dilution, the

calculated iron concentration in the salt was 132 ppm.

Data obtained by counting the *° Fe tracer showed 137
ppm, while colorimetric analysis indicated an iron
concentration of 176 ppm. The second dilution should

have reduced the iron concentration to 82 ppm. Tracer

counting data showed a concentration of 78 ppm, and a
colorimetric analysis showed 122 ppm. Part of the iron
fluoride was then reduced by sparging the salt with
hydrogen. Tracer counting data indicated that less than

"5 ppm of iron remained in solution, while colorimetric

analysis indicated iron concentrations greater than 20

‘lower than the value of 3.2 X 107% mole sec™ cm
for the first three runs with the old column having the

ppm. This test demonstrated that the data obtained
from colorimetric analyses are less accurate than those
obtained by $°Fe tracer counting, especially at very
low iron concentrations.

Following these tests, a larger amount (~15 mCi) of
$9Fe tracer was added to the salt in the feed tank of
the continuous salt purification system after three iron
fluoride reduction runs had been carried out using the
new column. In 14 succeeding experiments on iron
fluoride reduction, the variation between duplicate

* samples of salt containing iron fluoride was £1.8% by

S9Fe tracer counting and #4.2% by colorimetric
analysis. Since the average reduction per run was only
4.8%, it is apparent that the tracer method is more
suitable for obtaining meaningful data from the new
column. Data from the runs are summarized in Table
19.1. The average mass transfer coefficient, ku, for the

new column was 7.8 X 107% mole sec™ cm™, which is

thicker-wall packing. The average mass transfer coeffi-
cient, ka, is defined by the following expression:

kia = product of the mass transfer coefficient and the

L = salt flow rate, g-moles/sec,
A = cross-sectional area of column, cm?,
H = height of column, cm,

The mass transfer coefficient, ka, is reported instead of

"not known. Since the salt does not wet the packing, it

did not seem reasonable to assume the interfacial area

"to be equal to the surface area of the packing as is

normally done in systems where the packing is wetted
by the dispersed phase. About half of the reduction
runs were made with dilute hydrogen (13 to 19 vol %).
Changes in the hydrogen partial pressure caused no
decrease in the rate of reduction; this validates our
previous assumption, that the rate of reaction is
controlled by the rate at which iron fluoride is
transferred from the bulk of the salt to the salt-gas
interface rather than being controlled by the rate of
reaction at the interface. } .

A total: of 18 runs were made to obtain salt holdup
data during the countercurrent flow of argon and salt in
the column. The data were obtained by observing the

243

amount of salt that drained from the column after salt
flow was stopped at the end. of a run. Additional data
points were obtained by changing the salt or gas flow
rate during a run and observing the change in salt
inventory in the feed and receiver tanks. Most of the
runs were made with a range of salt flow rates and a
constant (2-liter/min) argon flow rate. Data from the
best runs showed a linear increase in salt holdup from
about 5% of the column void volume at 100 cm? /min
to about 11% at 500 cm?®/min. Several runs were also

-made with a range of argon flow rates and a constant
-(250-cm®/min) salt flow rate. In these runs, the salt

holdup appeared to decrease about 25% at the maxi-
mum gas flow rate from the maximum salt holdup,
which was observed at an argon flow rate of about 7
liters/min.
