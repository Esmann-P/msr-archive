POSTIRRADIATION EXAMINATION OF MATERIALS FROM THE MSRE
H.E.McCoy B.McNabb

- ABSTRACT

The Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment operated very successfully. The fuel loop was above 500°C
for 30,807 hr and contained fuel salt for 21,040 hr. A surveillance program was active during
operation to follow the property changes of the graphite moderator and the INOR-8 structural
material. After operation was discontinued in December 1969, several components were removed for
examination. These included a graphite moderator element from the core, a control rod thimble,
freeze valve 105, the sample cage and mist shield from the fuel salt pump bowl, a copper sampler
capsule, tubes and a portion of the shell of the primary heat exchanger, and tubes and two
thermocouple wells from the air-cooled radiator. =

Examination of these materials showed excellent mutual chemical compatibility between the
salts, graphite, and INOR-8. The INOR-8 exposed to fuel salt formed shallow intergranular cracks
believed to be due to the ingress of the fission product tellurium. The INOR-8 was also embrittled by
exposure to thermal neutrons, and this was attributed to the formation of helium by the ! OB(n, a)’ Li
transmutation.

INTRODUCTION

The Molten-Salt Reactor ‘Experiment was a unique fluid-fuel reactor.! It operated at temperatures
around 650°C for more than 30,000 hr between 1965 and December 1969. Operation was terminated in
1969 because the technical feasibility and promise of molten salt systems had been demonstrated, and the
operating funds were needed for development work associated with advanced concepts of molten-salt
reactors.

Surveillance samples of graphite and INOR-8 were removed periodically during operation of the MSRE,
and these were examined in detail. After operation, parts of several components were examined. The details
of the examinations of the various sets of INOR-8 surveillance samples were reported,2™ and some of the
observations made on the various components were discussed in a topical report® dealing with intergranular
cracking of INOR-8. The present report consolidates the observations made on the surveillance samples and
the components. The components include a control-rod thimble from the core, a freeze valve that isolated
the reactor vessel and a fuel drain tank, the salt sampler cage and mist shield from the fuel salt pump bowl,
a portion of the shell and several tubes from the primary heat exchanger; two thermocouple wells from the
coolant circuit, and several tubes from the air radiator in the coolant circuit.

and the significance of the postoperation examination.

Description

The parts of the MSRE with which we will be concerned are included in the flowsheet in Fig. 1. The
MSRE consisted basically of the primary circuit including the reactor vessel, a fuel pump, and an
intermediate heat exchanger; a coolant circuit including the tube side of the intermediate heat exchanger, a
coolant pump, and an air radiator; and several auxiliary components associated with fuel and coolant salt
storage and fission gas processing. All metallic parts that contacted salt were made of a nickel-base alloy
known as INOR-8 and now available commercially under the trade names of Hastelloy N and Allvac N. This
alloy, developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory® specifically for use in fluoride salts, has the nominal
composition Ni—16% Mo—7% Cr—5% Fe—0.05% C. The graphite moderator was made of a special
low-porosity graphite, grade CGB, to exclude salt from the. graphite pore structure.” The graphite was
produced in the form of bars 2.5 in. square by 72 in. long. These were machined to 2 in. square with a
channel on each face for fuel salt flow.

The fuel salt composition was LiF-BeF, -ZrF 4-UF, (65-30-5-<1 mole %); the coolant was LiF—34 mole
%BeF,. At full power the 1200-gpm fuel stream normally entered the reactor vessel at 632°C and left at
654°C; the maximum outlet temperature at which the reactor operated for any substantial period of time
was 663°C (1225°F). When the reactor was at low power, the salt systems were usually nearly isothermal at
about 650°C. During extended shutdowns the salt was drained into tanks, where it was kept molten while
the circulating loops were allowed to cool. Plugs of salt frozen in flattened sections of pipe (“freeze
valves) were used to isolate the drain tanks from the loop. The liquidus temperature. of the fuel salt was
about 440°C and that of the coolant salt was 459°C, so the loops were heated to 600 to 650°C with
external electric heaters before the salt was transferred from the storage tanks. Helium (sometimes argon)
was the cover gas over the fuel and coolant salts. . |
During operation, samples of fuel salt were obtained by lowering small copper buckets (capsules) into
the pool of salt in the ‘pump bowl. The pump bowl served as the surge space for the loop and also for
separation of gaseous fission products from a 50-gpm stream of salt sprayed out into the gas space above
the salt pool. To protect the sample bucket from the salt spray in the pump bowl, a spiral baffle of INOR-8
extended from the top of the bowl down into the salt pool. A cage of INOR-8 rods inside the spiral baffle
guided the sample capsule in the pump bowl.

The fuel system was contained in a cell in which an atmosphere of nitrogen containing from 2 to 5%
oxygen was maintained. This containment atmosphere was recirculated through a system that provided
cooling for the control rods and the freeze valves. Most of the coolant piping was exposed to air.

History

The history of the MSRE during the four years in which it operated at significant power is outlined in
Fig. 2. Construction was finished and salt was charged into the tanks late in 1964. Prenuclear testing,
including 1100 hr of salt circulation, occupied January through May 1965. During nuclear startup
experiments in May through July 1965, fuel salt was circulated for 800 hr. The salt was drained, and final

preparations for power operations were made in the fall of 1965. Low-power experiments in December led
into the history covered in Fig. 2 (see Haubenreich and Engel’ ® and MSR Program semiannual progress
reports for more detail).

The nuclear fuel was 33%-enriched 235U, and the UF, concentration in the fuel salt was 0.8 mole %
until 1968. Then the uranium was removed by fluorination and 233UF, was substituted. The UF,
concentration required with 233 U was only 0.13 mole %. The composition of the fuel salt was observed by
frequent sampling from the pump bowl.!! Aside from the 233U loading and periodic additions of small
increments of uranium or plutonium to sustain the nuclear reactivity, the only other additions to the fuel
salt were more or less routine small (~10-g) quantities of beryllium and, in two or three experiments, a few
grams of zirconium and FeF,. The purpose of these additions was to adjust the U(IIN)/U(IV) ratio, which
affects the corrosion potential and the oxidation state of corrosion-product iron and nickel and fission
product niobium. -

The primary corrosion mechanism in the fuel salt system was selective removal of chromium by

~

2UF4 + Cr(in alloy) = 2UF; + CrF,(in salt) ,

and the concentration of chromium in salt samples was the primary indicator of corrosion. Figure 3 shows
chromium concentrations observed in the MSRE fuel over the years of power operation. The step-down in
chromium concentration in the salt in 1968 was effected by processing the salt after the 235U fluorination.
The total increase in chromium in the 4700-kg charge of fuel salt is equivalent to leaching all of the
chromium from the 852 ft? of INOR-8 exposed to fuel salt to a depth of about 0.4 mil.

Since the coolant salt did not contain uranium, the corrosion rate was extremely low. During operation,
the chromium content of the coolant salt remained at 32 ppm, within the accuracy of the analysis.

EXAMINATION OF A GRAPHITE MODERATOR ELEMENT

Description of Graphite Elements

The properties of the grade CGB graphite used to fabricate the moderator elements are given by McCoy
and Weir.!2 It is basically a petroleum needle coke that was bonded with coal-tar pitch, extruded to rough
shape, and heated to 2800°C. High density and low permeability were achieved through multiple
impregnations and heat treatments. The product was well graphitized and highly anisotropic.

The graphite was produced as bars 2.5 in. square by 72 in. long. These bars were machined to several
configurations, but most of them had the geometry shown in Fig. 4. These elements were assembled as
shown in Fig. 5 to form the core. The elements fit together to form channels for salt flow. Four moderator
blocks were left out to leave spaces for three control rod thimbles and a surveillance assembly. The five
elements “enclosed” by the four spaces had INOR-8 lifting lugs so that they could be easily removed for
examination.

Visual Examination of Element 1184

One of the five removable graphite core moderator elements (1184) was examined in the
High-Radiation-Level Examination Laboratory (HRLEL) after completion of the operation of the MSRE.
Visual examination revealed machining marks still plainly visible in the fuel channels and on surfaces not
exposed directly to flowing fuel salt, indicating little if any change during operation. Figure 6 is a
photograph of the fuel channel facing the center of the reactor, and it shows the excellent condition of the
core block. The small thumbnail flaw in the fuel channel about 39 in. from the top is likely a small crack
that was in the bar during fabrication, since tool marks are on the top of the flaw and skip over an area at
the end of the flaw. The few scratches on the surface are not very deep and were likely caused by handling.

. There was a crack in the graphite around the INOR-8 lifting stud that was screwed into the top of the
bar. This crack extended about halfway around the bar, as shown by the short arrows in Fig. 7. The long
arrow indicates the same channel in the different views. The small punch mark visible in the top view was
made to indicate the fuel channel toward the center of the reactor, with a control rod on one side and the
surveillance sample basket on the other side. The crack in the graphite did not affect the integrity of the
bar, since it was on the end, and several threads remained to secure the lifting stud. The crack was probably
caused by the approximate twofold difference in thermal expansion of graphite and INOR-8.

Length, width, and bowing were measured. There were no significant changes — all measurements were
within the original tolerance for fabrication of the core block. The measured length of the approximately
rectangular portion of the bar was 64.50 + 0.03 in. Thus, there was no measurable change in length. Width
measurements across the flat parallel surfaces were made by reading 1- to 2-in. micrometers through the
Kollmorgen periscope. The original dimensional tolerances were 1.998 *9-9%0 in. The measurements shown
in Table 1 were made at approximately 1-ft intervals from top to bottom of the side facing the center of
the reactor, Measurements were also made near the top, middle, and bottom at 90° to those listed in Table
1 on the sides that had 0.0375 in. relief on each side for flow between the channels starting 2 in. from
either end. Values obtained were: top = 1.9226 in., middle = 1.9231 in., and bottom = 1.9230 in. All
measurements were within tolerance, so we believe that there were no significant changes or observable
trends, even though no actual measurements of the individual bars were recorded before operation.

The bowing was measured by stretching a string tightly between two C-clamp fixtures at either end of
the bar and measuring the distance between the bar and the string with a cathetometer, then rotating the

exposure to molten salt). There is no apparent change, as the small cracks and the small chip missing from
the bottom are apparent in both photographs, and the numbers are just as legible as before operation.

A cross section of the INOR-8 lifting stud in contact with the graphite is shown in Fig. 9. There appears
to be little if any reaction with the graphite. There is a surface modified layer about 1 or 2 mils deep similar
to that observed on surveillance samples and attributed to cold working of the surface and subsequent heat
treatment during service. There appears to be very little difference in the side of the thread in contact with
the graphite and the root of the thread, which probably was not in intimate contact.

Chemical Analysis of the Moderator Element

Small samples were core-drilled from various locations of the moderator element for chemical analyses
by the spark-source mass spectrograph and by Auger spectroscopy. Small electrodes (* in. diam) were used
in the spark-source mass spectrograph. Small amounts of the electrodes were vaporized and the
concentrations of various atomic masses measured. In Auger spectroscopy the surface of the sample is
bombarded with electrons. Vacancies are created in the inner electron shell of some atoms, and some of the
excited atoms revert to the ground state by emitting an electron as a result of a radiationless
transition. 315 This Auger electron has an energy that is characteristic of the parent atom. Only the atoms
in the first one to three layers are involved, and excellent sensitivities are attainable.

due to working effects from machining the thread. Reduced 35%.

The results of the mass spectrographic analyses are given in Table 2. These data are quite useful, but
several factors limit their accuracy. The penetration of the spark into the graphite was likely a hemisphere,
so some new surface continued to be included as the penetration depth increased. The calculated depths are
estimates of the maximum depths sampled, and the sensitivity of the analysis increases with increasing
current. The size of the area sampled is also of concern, particularly at the lower penetration depths. This
graphite has pores about 0.1 um (1000 A) in diameter, and the compositions of the first samples (taken
from areas a few angstroms in diameter) could be quite dependent upon the location. These factors make it
impossible to obtain a quantitative concentration profile, but it appears that the fission products are
concentrated at the surface and decrease rapidly with depth.

Auger analyses were performed on several samples from the MSRE. The results a are summarized i in Table
3. Sample 6, the first analyzed, was taken from a core surveillance specimen removed from the MSRE in
April 1968 at the conclusion of operation with 235U fuel. The other samples were all 0.3-in.-diam plugs
taken by core drilling various parts of the graphite moderator element 1184. The data in Table 3 are
normalized relative to a carbon peak of 100, and peak heights are given in arbitrary units. The data are not
quantitative due to lack of suitable standards, and because the sensitivity is different for different elements
and for different peaks for the same element, peak height cannot be equated to concentration.

%Mass numbers of molybdenum fission products.

Samples 5, 7, and 10 were taken from the flow channel: sample 5, 3 in. from the top; sample 7, in the
center; and sample 10, 3 in. from the lower end of the element. Samples M6 and 13 were taken from the
edge of the graphite moderator element (outside the main flow channel), with sample 13 about 3 in. from
the bottom of the element and sample M6 about halfway along the element.

All the samples examined had substantial amounts of Mo, Tc, S, and Rh. Iron, nickel, and chromium
were present on most of the samples, with the two samples from the bottom of the moderator element
(samples 10 and 13) having the largest concentrations. Tellurium is probably present on all the samples and
is discussed briefly below. Peaks that may be associated with antimony were detectable on samples 10 and
13, although the peaks are not listed in Table 3. An unresolved pair of peaks tentatively identified as due to
palladium were detected at 330 eV on nearly all of the samples. Tellurium, chromium, and ruthenium
concentrations are difficult to determine because of interference from strong lines of oxygen, carbon, and
molybdenum. The largest amounts of tellurium and chromium are probably similar in quantity to the
largest amounts of iron. We believe that ruthenium is probably present, but the lines are not nearly as
strong as those for molybdenum. Low-energy Auger peaks like that at 20 eV for tellurium are frequently
very strong; thus the large amplitudes listed in Table 3 need not be associated with high surface
concentrations of tellurium. Pure tellurium would have several strong peaks between 400 and 500 eV, but
our data do not disclose strong lines on any of the recorded spectra at these energies.

Summary of Observations

One graphite moderator element that had been in the MSRE during its entire operation was removed
and was examined in the hot cells. The element was in excellent mechanical condition, and no dimensional
changes were detectable. One small crack, which appeared to have been present in the element before
installation, was noted in one of the fuel channels, and a small crack was formed adjacent to an INOR-8
lifting stud by differential expansion during thermal cycling.

Some samples were taken from the moderator element and from one surveillance assembly for chemical
analysis. Techniques involving the spark source mass spectrograph and Auger spectroscopy were utilized.
These techniques were not sufficiently developed and the number of samples was too few to warrant
sweeping conclusions. However, most of the fission products and the elements in INOR-8 were noted near
the graphite surface; penetration into the graphite was very limited.

EXAMINATION OF THE GRAPHITE AND INOR-8 SURVEILLANCE SPECIMENS

Two surveillance facilities were available in the MSRE. One was in the core in the lower-left open
position shown in Fig. 5 and contained INOR-8 and graphite specimens that were exposed to the fuel salt.
(The other three positions contained control rods.) Another surveillance facility was outside the core,
where INOR-8 was exposed to the cell environment of 2 to 5% O, in nitrogen. Samples were removed
periodically from both facilities. They were examined visually, and the INOR-8 samples were subjected to
mechanical property tests and metallographic examination.

The details of the visual examinations were reported previously.! ¢™! 2 The first assembly removed from
the core suffered some damage because relative movement of the graphite and INOR-8 parts was
restricted.’® Minor design modifications eliminated this problem. The graphite in each surveillance
assembly was in excellent condition; machining marks were clearly visible, and we found no evidence of
chemical reaction with the fuel salt. The peak fluence received by the graphite was about 1 X 10%!
neutrons/cm? (>50 keV), and the resulting dimensional changes should have been less than 0.1%.2° These
dimensional changes should not have resulted in significant changes in the mechanical properties of the
graphite, so no tests were run on the samples. Numerous samples were used to study fission product
deposition and penetration into the graphite, and the results of these studies have been summarized
elsewhere?!

INOR-8 specimens were removed from the surveillance facilities inside and outside the reactor vessel.
These specimens were examined visually and metallographically and were subjected to various mechanical
property tests. The details of these examinations are presented in other reports?225 and will only be
summarized here.

Specimens outside the reactor vessel were above S00°C up to 17,483 hr and received a peak thermal
fluence of 2.6 X 10'? neutrons/cm?. They were oxidized, and metallographic examination revealed that
the oxide penetrated about 5 mils. The specimens from the core were exposed to fuel salt and were only
slightly discolored. They were above 500°C for periods up to 19,136 hr and received thermal fluences up to
1.5 X 10?! neutrons/cm?. Metallographic examination revealed only minor changes in microstructure. A
shallow layer of modified structure less than 1 mil thick was noted. This layer etched more rapidly and
contained some lamellar product. The amount of this modified layer did not vary systematically with time
or temperature of exposure. Experiments produced evidence that the effect was likely due to cold work
from machining, causing carbide to precipitate more rapidly near the surface during high-temperature
service. This structural change is not of significant importance.

The postirradiation mechanical property tests on the INOR-8 samples showed that the high-temperature
fracture strain of the alloy was decreased by irradiation. This is attributed to the helium produced by the
19B(n,a)"Li transmutation. However, considerable progress has since been made in developing an alloy
with modified chemical composition that has improved resistance to helium-induced embrittlement.2®

Metallographic examination of the deformed surveillance samples revealed shallow intergranular
cracking, particularly in samples deformed at 25°C. This type of cracking indicates intergranular
embrittlement, and considerable evidence shows that the embrittlement is due to the inward diffusion of
the fission product tellurium.? 7 Although the cracks were only a few mils deep in samples from the MSRE,
there is considerable concern over how cracks would propagate by this process in a power reactor over a
30-year operating period.

EXAMINATION OF INOR-8 CONTROL ROD THIMBLE

Physical Description

The MSRE used three control rods fabricated of Gd, 05 and Al,03 canned in Inconel 600.2% The
control rods operated inside thimbles made of 2-in.-OD X 0.065-in.-wall INOR-8 tubing. The assembly
before insertion in the MSRE is shown in Fig. 10. Thimble 3 was examined in some detail.

The detailed shop drawings for the thimble are shown in Fig. 11. The thimble tubing was made from
INOR-8 heat Y-8487, and spacers were machined from INOR-8 heat 5060 (see Table 4 for compositions).
The spacers were joined to the thimble by: beads of weld metal that were deposited on the tubing through
clearance holes in the sleeves.

The exterior of the thimble was éxposed to fuel salt and the interior to the cell environment of N, +
O,. The tubing was above 500°C for 30,807 hr and received a peak thermal fluence of 1.9 X10?!
neutrons/cm?. The lower portion of the control rod thimble was severed by electric arc cutting and moved
to the hot cells for examination. Figure 12 shows the electric arc cut at the left (about at the midplane of
the core), the spacer sleeves, and the end closure (located at the bottom of the core). The fuel salt appears
to have wet the INOR-8 near the center of the core, where the temperature and flux were highest (as shown
around the left weer space sleeves), but not at the bottom (as shown on the right sleeve). Some of

Fig. 12. Portion of control rod thimble examined after operation of MSRE was terminated. The thimble is made of
2-in.-OD X 0.065-in.-wall INOR-8 tubing (heat Y-8487). The electric arc cut on the left was near the center line of the
core.

the variations in light and dark areas are due to uneven lighting for the several photographs that make up
Fig. 12.

The first saw cut was made through the sleeve and thimble nearest the electric arc cut. The spacer sleeve
had been machined with ribs 0.100 in. high and 0.125 in. wide to position it relative to the graphite
moderator, and the sleeve had four drilled holes through which weld beads were deposited on the thimble
to hold the sleeve in place. According to the shop drawings, the minimum and maximum diametral
clearances between the thimble and the sleeve were 0.000 and 0.015 in. respectively. Thus salt would likely
enter this annular region and be in contact with most of the metal surfaces.

Undeformed Samples

Samples of the control rod thimble and the spacer sleeve were cut and examined to determine their
condition at the end of service. Typical photomicrographs of the inside of the thimble tube are shown in
Fig. 13. This surface was oxidized to a depth of about 2 mils by the cell environment of nitrogen containing
2 to 5% 0,. The oxidation process modified the microstructure to a depth of 4 mils, likely by the selective
removal of chromium.

Photomicrographs of one of the weld beads are shown in Fig. 14. All of the surface shown was exposed
to flowing fuel salt. Some grains were dislodged near the surface, and grain boundaries are visible in the
as-polished condition to a depth of 1 to 1.5 mils.

Photomicrographs involving the interface between the thimble and sleeve are shown in Fig. 15. Figure
15(a) shows the annular region with a separation of about 7 mils and some salt present. Few surface
irregularities are visible at a magnification of 100x, indicating that they are considerably below 1 mil.
Figure 15(b) is a 500x view of the thimble and shows some surface cracks to a depth of 0.3 mil. The
outside of the sleeve is shown in Fig. 15(c); a few grain boundaries to a depth of about 1 mil are visible.
Additional photomicrographs of the sleeve are shown in Fig. 16. The sleeve material does not appear to
have received much work, since the carbide is very inhomogeneously distributed. Grain size is larger than
usual away from the stringers. The inner and outer surfaces both have modified structures. A higher
magnification view of the inner surface [Fig. 16(b)] shows that much of the modification is a high density

of primary carbide. The outer surface [Fig. 16(c)] has a shallow layer of small grains, likely due to a

working operation.

A second cut was made away, from the sleeve, and typical photomicrographs are shown in Fig. 17. This
part of the thimble was exposed: to flowing salt. Some of the grain boundaries are visible in the as-polished
condition to a depth of about 4 mils; and there is some surface modification [Fig. 17(a)] . Etching {Fig.
17(b)] delineates more of the grain structure and shows the shallow surface modification.

Microprobe scans were run on the thimble samples that were taken from under the sleeve and outside
the sleeve. In the first case the thimble wall was exposed to almost static fuel salt, and no gradients in iron
and chromium concentration could be detected within the 3-um region of uncertainty near the surface. The
sample outside the sleeve, which was exposed to flowing fuel salt, was depleted in chromium to a depth of
almost 20 um and in iron to a depth of 10 um (Fig. 18). Thus the amount of corrosion that occurred varied
considerably in the two regions. Measurements were not actually made, but we would expect similar results
for the spacer sleeve. The inside surface was exposed to almost static salt and was likely not corroded
detectably. The outside surface was exposed to flowing salt and’ probably was depleted in iron and
chromium.

Deformed Samples

The next step was to deform some of the thimble and the sleeve to determine whether surface cracks
were formed similar to those noted in the surveillance samples. Since the product was tubular, we used a
relatively quick and cheap ring test. The fixture shown in Fig. 19 was made by (1) cutting %, in. through a
1-in.-thick carbon steel plate with a 2-in.-diam hole saw, (2) cutting out the partially cut region with ample
clearance around the hole, (3) cutting the plate in two along the diameter and removing 1% in. of material
on each side of the cut, and (4) tapping a %-in.-diam thread into the two pieces. Then rings ¥ in. wide
were cut from the thimble and the sleeve. They fit into the groove and were pulled to failure, with the
resultant geometry shown in Fig. 19. The initial loading curves include strain associated with the ring
conforming to the geometry of the grip, so we cannot tell precisely how much the sample is deforming.
Thus the yield strength and the elongation are only relative numbers, but the ultimate tensile strength and
reduction in area obtained from these tests are true values. Obviously, this type of test is deficient in giving
good mechanical property data, but is sufficient for deforming the material and observing the incidence of
surface cracking. :

The tensile properties of the rings are shown in Table 5. The test results show the following important
facts:

1. All the unannealed specimens of heat Y-8487 tested at 25°C have a “yield stress” of 52,000 to
61,000 psi, with these values appearing to be random in the variables examined.
2. At 25°C the crosshead displacement was about 1.2 in. for the unirradiated tubing and 0.4 to 0.5 in.

for the irradiated tubing. Again the variations from 0.4 to 0.5 in. appeared random.

© 3. The yield stresses at 650°C were about equivalent for irradiated and unirradiated tubing. However,
the crosshead displacement before fracture decreased from about 0.4 in. to 0.1 in, after irradiation. This
wis due to embrittlement from helium formed from the '®B(n,¢)”Li transmutation.

4. No material of heat 5060 (sleeve material) is available for unirradiated tests, but the vendor’s
certification sheet showed a yield stress of 46,300 psi, an ultimate tensile stress of 117,000 psi, and a
fracture strain of 52%. The values that we obtained show higher strengths and lower ductility.

Several of the specimens that had been strained were examined metallographically to determine the
extent of cracking during straining. Photomicrographs of the control rod thimble, which was exposed to
flowing salt, are shown in Fig. 20. The inside surface was oxidized, and the oxide cracked as the specimen
was strained. The oxide should be brittle, but it is important that these cracks did not penetrate the metal.

Fig. 19. Fixture for testing rings of control rod thimble and spacer sleeve. A tested sample is shown on the left.

However, the side exposed to the salt exhibited profuse intergranular cracking. Almost every grain
boundary cracked, and the cracks generally propagated to a depth of one grain, although there are several
instances where the crack depth exceeded a depth of one grain. Several photomicrographs were combined
and rephotographed to obtain Fig. 21. This sample had 192 cracks per inch, with average and maximum
depths of 5.0 and 8.0 mils respectively. Many of the cracks shown in Figs. 20 and 21 have blunt tips,
indicating that they did not propagate into the metal as the specimen was strained.

A similar sample was cut from the thimble under the sleeve, where the salt access was restricted.
Photomicrographs of a specimen tested at 25°C are shown in Fig. 22. The cracks are quite similar to those
in Fig. 20 for a sample that was exposed to flowing salt. The composite photograph in Fig. 23 is quite
similar to Fig. 21 of the sample exposed to flowing salt. The sample in Fig. 23 had 257 cracks per inch,
with average and maximum depths of 4.0 and 8.0 mils respectively. The accuracy of our statistics and
possible sampling inhomogeneities lead us to conclude that the severity of cracking is equivalent in the
samples exposed to flowing and almost static salt. Thus flow rate over the range represented by these two
sample locations does not appear to be an important variable.

Examination of the spacer sleeve gave us another opportunity to determine whether salt velocity and
cracking were related. The photomicrograph in Fig. 24 shows cracks on both sides, with more being present
in the field photographed on the side where the salt was rapidly flowing. However, the composite
photograph in Fig. 25 shows that cracking is about equivalent on both sides. Cracking statistics on the side

~ exposed to rapidly. flowing salt revealed 178 cracks per inch, with a maximum depth of 7.0 mils. The side
exposed to restricted salt flow had 202 cracks per inch, with a maximum depth of 5.0 mils. The average
depth was 3.0 mils on both sides. These observations also indicate that salt flow rate is not a significant
factor | in intergranular cracking. :

Summary of Observations

The control rod thimble was in excellent ‘physical condition, with only slight discoloration and
chromium depletion to a depth of 0.8 mil (20 um) observed. Mechanical property tests showed that the
thimble was embrittled slightly at 25°C and to a greater extent at 650°C. The reduction in ductility at 25°C
was likely due to carbide precipitation and that at 650°C to helium from the ! °B(n,0))” Li transmutation.

- The examination of the control rod thimble spacer revealed rather uniform cracking of all surfaces
exposed to fuel salt. This points out two important characteristics of the cracking. (1) Irradiation of the
metal was not solely responsible for the cracking. The flux attenuation across the wall of the thimble would
have been very slight, but cracks only formed in the metal on the fuel side (Fig. 20). Thus, irradiation alone
does not cause the cracking, but contact with the fuel salt is required. (2) The severity of cracking was not
sensitive to salt flow rate over the flow range experienced in a fuel channel and under a spacer with
restricted flow..

EXAMINATION OF FREEZE VALVE 105
Physical Description

Freeze valve 105 failed during the final thermal cycle involved in terminating the MSRE. The valve was

used to isolate one of the fuel drain tariks and was frozen only when salt was in that drain tank. The line

was filled with salt from the drain tanks, so the fission product concentration would have been relatively
low. The line was filled with salt at temperatures above. 500°C for about 21,000 hr, and the salt was static
_ except when the reactor was being filled.

Detailed fabrication drawings for FV-105 are shown in Fig. 26. The MSRE used several freeze valves. In

each a section of tubing was aircooled to freeze a salt plug that prevented salt or gas flow through the pipe.

The tubing was usually flattened, and a thin housing for the air coolant was welded around the flattened
section. The portion of the housing parallel to the tubing was kept thin so that it would accommodate the

differential expansion between the pipe and the housing when the valve was being thawed or frozen. Freeze

valve 105 involved a field modification to obtain more coolant. This modification, shown in detail in Fig.
27 and schematically in Fig. 28, resulted in the housing becoming too rigid to expand freely. The inability
of the inside to move freely relative to the coolant housing led to a fatigue failure in the inside pipe. The
location of the valve is shown i in Fig. 29.

Visual and Metallographic Examination

The salt was partially removed to reveal the crack shown in Figs. 30 through 32. The crack begins at the
spot on the weld and proceeds about 1 in. parallel to the weld.

A metallographic sample was taken from the cracked area. An as-polished view is shown in Fig. 33 and
an etched view in Fig. 34. The weld was on the outside of the tubing and supported the %-in. end plate of
the cooling shroud. The crack began near the weld outside the cooling shroud and penetrated the tube wall.

A comparison of the etched and unetched views shows that sore attack occurred along the crack and the

outer surface of one tubing and that etching completely removed material from the attacked region. The

attack was likely due to the simultaneous exposure of the INOR-8 to salt and moist air, and probably
involved the selective removal of chromium and iron, leaving metal that was heavily attacked by the
etchant. No such attack occurred on the inside, where only salt was present.

The failure that released salt was due to thermal fatigue. The cooling shroud was initially 0.020 in.
thick, but the added cooling tubes increased the thickness to 0.083 in. on the bottom. This made the
shroud relatively rigid on the bottom. During freezing and thawing, the outer part of the shroud changed
temperature more rapidly than the wall of the salt-containing tube. Whereas the outer part of the shroud
was: originally thin enough to deflect to accommodate the differences in length of the two members, the
field modifications made the bottom portion quite rigid. The result was that differences in temperature
imposed on the cooling shroud a stress that was transferred by the rigid (*-in.) end plate to the tube wall.
A crack was nucleated at the surface and propagated through the pipe wall during the numerous cycles.

Parts of three tubes are visible in Figs. 30 and 31. The large tube in relatively good condition is the type
304 stainless steel air inlet tube, the center tube is the original INOR-8 air outlet tube with two
thermocouples visible, and the hole is the remains of the type 304 stainless steel outlet tube. The original
INOR-8 air inlet line was capped off and is hidden by the salt. Attack of the type 304 stainless steel by salt
when air was present is as expected. The relative nobility of INOR-8 in this environment is a strong
argument for the use of INOR-8 where salt may be present.

Mechanical Property Tests

Three rings ¥,¢ in. wide were cut from the pipe away from the flattened section and were pulled in
tension in the same manner as previously described for the control rod thimble rings. One rectangular piece
was cut and bend-tested with the inside surface of the pipe in tension. Table 6 lists the observed mechanical

- properties. The yield stress was essentially unchanged, and the ultimate stress was reduced about 15% from

the vendor’s certified properties. The elongation was reduced considerably but was still greater than 25%. A
gage section is difficult to define in a ring test, so crosshead travel and reduction in area are reported for the
rings from freeze valve 105 rather than percent elongation. The bend test was discontinued because of
strain limitations of the bend fixture after 0.41 in. crosshead travel, which corresponds to 33% strain in the
outer fibers of the specimen and to a 90° bend angle. The yield stress calculated from the forces on the
bend specimen is too high because elastic formulas were used in the calculation and the specimen deformed
plastically, but this calculated quantity is useful for comparison with other bend tests that will be reported
later for the mist shield.

Figure 35 shows the tension side of the bend specimen. Some very fine shallow cracks are visible on the
surface in tension, and cracking is visible at the edges in the burrs remaining from the remote cutting
operation.

One of the three tensile-tested rings was examined metallographically. Figure 36 is a composite of
photomicrographs of a section through the specimen showing the inside surface, which was exposed to fuel
salt (top), and the outside, which was exposed to the cell environment of 2 to 5% O, in nitrogen. The
reason for the unevenness of the oxide on the outside is not known. Possibly it was due to corrosion after
the leak, although the rings were cut approximately 4 in. away from the nearest visible residue from the salt
leak. Figure 37 shows at 500x the oxide in one of the worst areas. The crack ends tend to be blunted and
did not penetrate the metal beyond the oxidized surface. Figure 38 shows at 500x the inside of the pipe
exposed to fuel salt. About 1 crack per grain or 240 cracks per inch show, but the cracks are shallow and
blunt, having an average depth of 0.75 mil and a maximum depth of 1.5 mils. Figure 39 shows that a large
amount of strain occurred before fracture.

Summary of Observations

The failure in freeze valve 105 was due to thermal fatigue as a result of the cooling shroud being too
rigid. The mechanical properties of the INOR-8 in the freeze valve were not degraded seriously by the long
exposure to fuel salt containing some fission products. Numerous intergranular cracks were formed on the
surfaces exposed to the salt during postoperation deformation. These cracks were similar to those on the
surfaces from the primary circuit but were shallower.

EXAMINATION OF THE SAMPLER ASSEMBLY

Physical Description

A schematic view of the MSRE fuel pump is shown in Fig. 40; more details are reported elsewhere.??
The components examined were the mist shield and the sampler cage. The fabrication drawings for these
parts are shown in Fig. 41. Salt-sample capsules or additions of uranium or beryllium were lowered by a
windlass arrangement into the sampler cage. The mist shield was provided to minimize the amount of salt
spray that would reach the sampler. The vertical sampler cage rods were %; in. in diameter and were made
of INOR-8 heat 5059, and the mist shield was made of %-in. sheet of INOR-8 heat 5075 (see Table 4 for

Fig. 42. Sampler cage. The assembly is 8.5 in. high. The salt-vapor interface corresponds with the region of highest
material deposition.

compositions). The mist shield was a 1%, -turn spiral about 2 in. ID X 3 in. OD. The outside was exposed up
to the normal liquid level to salt that was agitated by the stripper jets and to salt spray and the purge gas
above that level. There was also organic vapor and soot in this region from the decomposition of lubricating
oil that leaked into the pump bow! at a rate of a few grams per day. The inside was exposed to more nearly
quiescent salt up to the normal salt level and primarily to the purge gas above that level. The pump
components were above 500°C for 30,807 hr and in contact with fuel salt for 21,040 hr.

The general appearance of the sampler cage is shown in Fig. 42. The salt normally stayed at a level near
the center of the cage, but the level fluctuated slightly. The amount of material deposited on the surface is
much greater below the liquid interface than above. A gross gamma scan had a similar profile with a
maximum near the liquid interface. A carbonaceous deposit was present at the top of the sampler. The mist
shield had some deposits, which were heavier below the liquid level and on the outer surface of the shield.

Sampler Cage

One of the sampler cage rods was examined metallographically. Photomicrographs of samples from the
vapor and liquid regions are shown in Figs. 43 and 44 respectively. No intergranular penetration is visible at
this magnification. A heavy surface deposit was on the sample from the liquid region. This deposit was
examined by the electron microprobe analyzer. It contained some salt but had regions that were high in the
elements of INOR-8: Ni, Cr, Fe, and Mo. This is illustrated by the x-ray displays in Figs. 45 and 46, which
also show that the deposits were very inhomogeneous.

One of the sampler cage rods was pulled in tension at 25°C. The certified properties of this material
were a yield stress of 51,200 psi, an ultimate tensile stress of 115,300, and an elongation of S1%. The
measured properties of the sampler cage rod were a yield stress of 42,500 psi, an ultimate tensile stress of
93,400 psi, and an elongation of 35.7%. The property changes are not large and are likely due to some
stress relief, which decreased the yield and ultimate stress values, and carbide precipitation, which reduced
the ductility. A composite of the tested sample in Fig. 47 shows that the fracture occurred below the center
near the average liquid-gas interface. One metallographic sample was taken on the liquid side of the
fracture. A composite of the badly cracked edges is shown in Fig. 48. Note that the cracks extended toa
depth of 12 mils. A higher magnification view of an area near the fracture shows that the cracks extend
deeper than three grains and that several grains have fallen out (Fig. 49). Another metallographic sample
was taken ¥% in. above the fracture. A composite of photographs along the edge shows that the depth of
cracking decreases with increasing distance into the vapor region (Fig. 50). The severity of cracking is
different on the two edges of the rod. Unfortunately, we do not know the orientation of the rod relative to
the sampler and the mist sheild.

primarily to gas. Bend tests were performed on these specimens at 25°C using a three-point bend fixture.®°
They were bent about a line parallel to the %-in. dimension so that the outer surface was in tension. The
information obtained from such a test is a load deflection curve. The equations normally used to convert
this to a stress-strain curve do not take into account the plastic deformation of the part, and the stresses
obtained by this method become progressively in error (too high) as the deformation progresses.

Table 7 shows the results of bend tests on the specimens from the mist shield. Note that the yield and
ultimate stresses are about double those reported for uniaxial tension. The fracture strain is the parameter
of primary interest. Unexposed INOR-8 (heat N3-5106) did not fail after 40.5% strain in the outer fibers.
(No material was available of heat 5075, the material used in fabricating the mist shield.) Although all of
the samples strained more than 10% before failure, the two samples from the outside of the spiral were less
ductile than the other samples.

The bend samples of the mist shield were examined metallographically. Photomicrographs of the sample
from the inside vapor region are shown in Fig. 52, and a composite of several photomicrographs is shown in
Fig. 53. The edge cracks were intergranular and about 1 mil deep. The photomicrographs of the sample
from the liquid region (Fig. 54) show that the cracks extended to a depth of about 8 mils. The composite
photograph in Fig. 55 also shows the increased frequency and depth of cracking in the liquid region.

The sample from the outside liquid region was quite similar metallographically to that from the inside
liquid region. Photomicrographs of the fracture and a typical region of the tension side near the fracture are
shown in Figs. 56 and 57 respectively. A composite of several photomicrographs is shown in Fig. 58.

Photomicrographs of the outside vapor (salt spray) bend specimen at the fracture and on the tension side
near the fracture are shown in Figs. 59 and 60 respectively. The composite of several photomicrographs in
Fig. 61 shows that the cracks are not much deeper nor more frequent than in the liquid regions (compare
Figs. 55, 58, and 61), but the tendency for grains to fall out is much greater. This is even more significant
when one notes that the strain was the least in the sample from the outside vapor region (Table 7).

The reduced ductility of these samples remains unexplained. The maximum crack depth in the liquid
region was only 8 mils, and it is quite unlikely that an 8-mil reduction in a sample thickness of 125 mils
would cause much embrittlement. The embrittlement may have been partially due to the extensive carbide
precipitation shown in Figs. 53, 55, 56, 58, and 59. However, the outside and inside of the shield received
identical thermal treatments, but the samples from the outside had lower ductilities. Thus, attributing the
embrittlement solely to carbide formation does not seem appropriate.

Summary of Observations

The only free surface in the primary circuit was in the pump bowl, and there appears to have been a
collection of material at this surface. Visual observation, gamma scanning, and the electron microprobe
show an accumulation of salt, fission products, and corrosion products at this surface. Besides having a free
surface, the region around the sampler was often exposed to a reducing environment because of the
addition of beryllium metal at this location. Fluorides of the structural metals would be reduced to the
metallic form and could accumulate at the free surface or deposit on nearby metal surfaces. Some of the
less stable fission product fluorides would have likely reacted in a similar way. Thus, it is not surprising that
the intergranular cracks are most severe near the free surface. The most important observation relative to
the cracking is that its severity was much less in material exposed primarily to gas. This allows the
conclusion that exposure to liquid salt is necessary for the cracking to occur.

EXAMINATION OF A COPPER SAMPLE CAPSULE

Physical Description

Salt samples were routinely taken from the pump bowl for chemical analysis. About 10 g of salt was
required for an analysis, and the oxygen-free high-conductivity (OFHC) copper capsule shown in Fig. 62
was used to isolate this size of sample. The capsule was % in. in diameter by 1.6 in. long, with
hemispherical top and bottom. Salt entered through the two windows. The solid top was made of
nickel-plated iron and was sufficiently heavy to ensure that the capsule would be submerged in the salt. A
nickel-plated steel key was attached to the top of the capsule by a loop of %,-in.-diam stranded stainless
steel rope, which provided the flexibility necessary for the sample assembly to pass through the two
15-in.-radius bends in the transfer tube. The key locked the assembly to the latch on the drive unit cable.
The capsule was lowered into the pump bowl by a windlass arrangement that has been discussed in detail >!

The sampler facility worked well during the operation of the MSRE; 593 samples were taken and 152
fuel additions were made. However, two small capsules were lost, and one of these (which we examined)
was retrieved when the sample cage was removed from the fuel pump. The sample capsule was likely lost in
August 1967 and flattened during retrieval attempts with heavy magnets in April 1968. (The heavily
corroded steel cap was recovered at that time.) When actually recovered in January: 1971 the capsule was
discolored, deformed, and cracked. While in the MSRE, the capsule was almost certainly lying on the
bottom of the pump bowl, where it would have been exposed to flowing fuel salt. The capsule would have
been above 500°C for 16,400 hr and exposed to fuel salt for 13,025 hr. ’

Examination

Figure 63 shows a cracked area of the sample capsule with some deposited material on the outside of
the capsule. Figure 64 is a photomicrograph of the cracked area polished below the surface, showing the
intergranular nature and extent of the cracks. Figure 65 is a photomicrograph of a cross section of the
copper capsule, showing the thick deposit of material on both surfaces of the capsule.

An electron-probe ‘microanalysis of the material in the grain boundaries and x-ray scans for the
distribution of Ni, Fe, Cr, and Cu in the surface layer in the area around the large metallic particle on the
outer surface were made. Figure 66 shows the distribution of these elements, and it appears that the surface
layers were made up mostly of copper and nickel, with some areas containing high concentrations of
chromium and molybdenum. The inner and outer surfaces of the ‘capsule appear similar. The
grain-boundary precipitate was only 28% Cu, and no other element could be detected. This observation
indicates that the remainder is a light element, perhaps beryllium or lithium, that could not be detected by
the instrument. :

The surface deposits were ground away from two small pieces about 6 in. square by ¥, in. long. These
pieces were used as electrodes for the spark source mass spectrograph. We do not know the exact depth of
sparking, but we suspect that it was near the surface. The analysis of the copper is shown in Table 8. Several
important points can be made from this analysis. The spectrograph was not adjusted to detect lithium, but
the presence of U, Zr, Be, and F indicates that the fuel salt was present. Also, the isotopic concentrations of
uranium correspond to those of the first fuel charge rather than the later fuel charge in which the uranium
was predominantly 233 U. The weight percentages of various elements present in the initial fuel charge were
approximately 10.9% Zr, 6.3% Be, 67% F, 5.1% U, and 10.8% Li. These data indicate that relative to
uranium the material in the copper capsule was enriched in Zr and depleted in F and Be. There were also
significant quantities of Fe, Ni, Mo, and Cr, the main elements in INOR-8, as well as detectable quantities
of several other elements, many of which may have been present in the copper initially.

The copper is very brittle, and the present analytical results do not shed much light on what element is
responsible for the embrittlement.

- Summary of Observations

Although copper is generally accepted as being compatible with. fuel salt, this capsule was severely
embrittled in its 13,000-hr exposure to MSRE fuel salt. Heavy deposits quite similar to those noted on the
sample cage and shield were present on the surfaces of the copper capsule. Some of the constituents of
these deposits may have caused the embrittlement, but we were unable to identify the responsible element.

EXAMINATION OF THE PRIMARY HEAT EXCHANGER
Physical Description

“The MSRE heat exchanger. was the tube-and- shell type, with the fuel salt on the shell side and the
coolant salt in the U-tubes. The shell was 16% in. OD X ¥% in. wall X about 8 ft long and was fabricated
from INOR-8 heat 5068. The heat exchanger tubing was !%; in. OD X 0.042 in. wall from INOR-8 heat
N2-5101 (see Table 4 for chemical compositions). The structural details of the heat exchanger 32 and the
special method of joining the tubes to the header, which involved welding and back brazing,3 have been
described. The completed tube bundle is shown in Fig. 67.

Examination

The heat exchanger was above 500°C for 30,807 hr and was exposed to fuel salt for 21,040 hr.
An oval piece of the shell 10 X 13 in. was cut by plasma torch near the outlet end of the heat
exchanger. This same cut severed a piece of one tube, and pieces of five others were cut by an
abrasive wheel. These parts are shown in Figs. 68 and 69. The outside of the shell had a dark
adherent oxide; the inside surfaces were discolored slightly and had a thin bluish-gray coating,
probably caused by the plasma cutting operation. Some of this powder was brushed off and found
by gamma scanning to contain '®Ru and !'258b.

Photomicrographs of a cross section through the outer surface of the shell are shown in Fig. 70.
The oxide on the outside surface is typical of that observed on INOR-8 at this temperature and
extends to a depth of about 5 mils. Etching attacks the metal in the oxidized layer and etches the
grain boundaries near the surface more rapidly than those in the interior. The inside surface of the
shell (Fig. 71) shows some structural modifications to a depth of about 1 mil. No samples of the
shell were deformed.

Photomicrographs of a typical cross section of the heat exchanger tubing are shown’ in Fig. 72.
The overall view shows that both sides etch more rapidly than the center to a depth of about 7
mils. This is not unusual for a tubular product and is often attributed to impurities (primarily
lubricants) that are worked into the metal surface during repeated steps of deformation and
annealing. The higher magnification views in the as-polished condition show that grain boundary
attack (or cracking) occurred on the surface exposed to fuel salt (outer) but not on the coolant side
(inner). The temperatures under normal operating conditions were such that the fuel salt side would
have been in compression.

Similar photomicrographs of a longitudinal section of tubing are shown in Fig. 73. The features.

are quite similar to those discussed for Fig. 72. Both figures show some metallic deposits on the
outside surface, which was exposed to fuel salt. These deposits are extremely small and could not be
analyzed with much accuracy with the in-cell microprobe. However, they seemed to be predominately
iron. Scanning across the tubing detected no concentration gradients of the major alloying elements
in INOR-8.

‘Tensile tests were run on three of the tubes, and the results are compared with those for
as-received tubing in Table 9. The tubes were pulled in tension, and we assumed that the entire
section between the grips was deforming. The grips offer some end restraint, so our assumption is
obviously in error, and the errors are such that our yield stresses are high and our fracture strains are
low; however, the ultimate stresses and reductions in area are unaffected by this assumption. The
as-received and postoperation tests were run by the same technique, so the results should be
comparable. The largest changes during service were reductions in the yield stress, fracture strain, and
reduction in area. The tubing was bought in the “cold drawn and annealed” condition, but such
tubing normally is cold worked some during a final straightening operation. The reduction in yield
strength during service may ‘have been due to annealing out the effects of this working. The
reductions -in the ductility were likely due to the precipitation of carbides along the grain boundaries.

Photomicrographs of one of the tubes deformed at 25°C are shown in Fig. 74. Profuse
intergranular cracks were formed to a depth of about 5 mils on the side exposed to fuel salt, but
none were formed on the coolant salt side. Etching again revealed the abnormal etching charac-
teristics near the surface, but whatever caused this abnormality did not result in grain-boundary
embrittlement.

Unstressed and stressed sections of tubing were photographed over relatively large distances to get
more accurate statistics on crack numbers and depths. Composite photographs of the two samples are
shown in Fig. 75. The cracks are readily visible in the stressed sample but may not be apparent in

the unstressed sample. A higher magnification print used in making the composite is shown in Fig.
76; the cracks can be more easily seen. The stressed sample had 262 cracks per inch with an average
depth of 5.0 mils. Two counts. were made on the unstressed. sample. In the first count only those
features that unequivocally were cracks were counted. This gave a crack count of 228 per inch with
an average depth of 2.5 mils. In another count, we included some features that were possibly cracks,
and this gave a crack frequency of 308 per inch. Thus the number of cracks present before straining
was about equivalent to that noted after straining. Straining did increase the visible depth. Some
indirect evidence that the cracks were present initially and only spread open further during the
tensile test was obtained from examination of the sample in Fig. 75. The sample length shown
deformed 39% (Table 9), and the combined widths of the cracks account for 35% strain. Thus, the
crack widths very closely account for the total strain and indicate that the cracks formed with little
or no deformation and spread open as the sample was deformed.

Summary of Observations

The primary heat exchanger operated in contact with fuel salt for 21,040 hr without any leaks or other
problems developing. The outside of the shell was oxidized to a depth of a few mils. The surfaces exposed
to coolant salt showed no evidence of intergranular cracking or corrosion. The tube surfaces exposed to fuel
salt had shallow intergranular cracks that opened further when samples were strained but did not propagate
much deeper into the tube wall. Since the neutron fluence received by this component was quite small,
neutron irradiation evidently was not a significant factor in causing the intergranular cracking. However, the
need for contact with the fuel salt was clearly demonstrated, since cracks were formed only on the outside

"surface of the tubing.

EXAMINATION OF THE COOLANT RADIATOR
Physical Description

The energy produced in the MSRE was dissipated through a radiator cooled by air. The coolant fluid
was LiF—-34 mole % BeF, and flowed through the tube side of the primary heat exchanger, the coolant
pump, and the radiator. The coolant circuit was at service conditions for about 26,000 hr. About half this
time the system was isothermal at 650°C, and during the other half the salt temperature varied from 593°C
entering the radiator to 538°C leaving.

The examination of the tubes exposed to coolant i in the primary heat exchanger was described in the
previous chapter. We also examined some tubes from the inlet and outlet ends of the radiator and two
thermocouple wells located at the inlet and outlet ends of the radiator. The results of this examination will
be discussed in this section. oo
~The details. of the construction and operation of the radiator have been reported,3* and an assembly
drawing is shown in Fig. 77. The radiator tubing was % in. OD X 0.072 in. wall, of INOR-8 heat 5097 (see
Table 4 for chemical composition). The tubing was fabricated by Wall Tube and Metal Products Company,
Newport, Tennessee, to specifications MET-RM-B-163, MET- NDT-3, and MET-NDT-165. After fabrication
the material was annealed at some unspecified temperature, likely in the range 1000 to 1200°C.

The details of the thermocouple wells are shown in Fig. 78. The well itself was fabricated from INOR-8
heat 2477 and welded to the 5-in. schedule-40 header pipe of INOR-8 heat Y-8699 (see Table 4 for
compositions). As shown in Fig. 78, the well was machined with a lip that had to be hand finished in the
field to fit the contour of the 5-in, pipe.

Observations

Visual examination of the tubing revealed an adherent oxide on the outside surface, which was exposed
to air. The inside surface of the tubing was exposed to coolant salt and was very clear and free of deposits
of metal or salt.

Typical photomicrographs of the as-received tubing are shown in Fig. 79. The relatively fine grain size
of the material and the carbide stringers in the primary working direction are evident in Fig. 79(a). Figure
79(b) shows a typical high-magnification view of the carbide stringers in the as-polished condition. The
carbide is quite brittle, and the particles fracture during fabrication to produce cracks a few tenths of a mil
long. An etched view of the inside edge is shown in Fig. 79(c). The etchant attacked the carbide readily,

-causing particles to fall out and to leave holes. A typical etched cross-sectional view is shown in Fig. 79(d).
The stringers are not apparent since they are being viewed from the ends.

The microstructure of the tubing was altered two ways during service. The outside of the tubing was

oxidized, and the inside of the tubing etched more rapidly to a depth of about 5 mils. These changes are
| shown in Fig. 80 for tubing at the inlet end and in Fig. 81 for the outlet end. The oxidation is not
| excessive, and the penetration of the oxide front is typical for nickel alloys with chromium content as low
as that in INOR-8.

 

We investigated further the difference in etching characteristics near the inside surface of the tubing. A
less aggressive electrolytic etchant was used to delineate the carbide structure better. The as-received
material is shown in Fig. 82. There is still some attack of the primary carbide stringers, but very few fine
carbide particles are present. The tubing from the inlet end of the heat exchanger is shown in Fig. 83. Fine
carbide is present throughout the material, concentrated along the grain boundaries and even more
concentrated near the surface. The tubing from the outlet end looked very similar. Thus the long time in
service caused carbide to precipitate throughout the material, particularly near the inside surface.

In further pursuit of the different etching characteristics near the surface, we examined the samples
with the electron microprobe analyzer. No composition variations in Cr, Mo, Ni, or Fe were observable to
within 2 um of the surface (the allowable working range on these samples). The lubricants used in drawing
tubing are often high in silicon or carbon, but the concentrations of these elements were too low for the
electron microprobe analyzer. We machined turnings from the tube for analysis for these elements, and the
results are given in Table 10. The analysis shows a higher carbon concentration at the inside surface, a fact
that should lead to increased carbide precipitation. The carbon would be dissolved by the postfabrication
anneal and reprecipitate during service.

We tensile tested a piece of pipe from the outlet end and a piece of as-received tubing from the same lot
(heat 5101). The properties are given in Table 11. The only significant property changes were the fracture
strain and the reduction in area. However, these changes are rather modest and do not indicate a serious
embrittlement of the material.

The inlet thermocouple well after it was cut off with a coated welding electrode is shown in Fig. 84.
The oxidized appearance and the metal fragments on the part arose from the cutting operation. The circular
piece of material is part of the 5-in. pipe wall. The thermocouple well was machined from bar stock and
extended about 3 in. into the flowing salt stream. The cross-sectional view of part of the inlet well in Fig.
85 makes the geometry more evident. The pipe wall, the welds, and the thermocouple well are evident.

Metallographic examination of the mounted cross section shown in Fig. 85 revealed that the weld had
cracked on the salt side of the pipe. The cracks on both of the polished surfaces in Fig. 85 are shown in Fig.
86. In the worst case the cracks penetrated to a depth of about 3 mils. The remaining half of the well was
cleaned by acid etching to remove the metal left from the cutting operation, and the weld was checked with
dye penetrant. A photograph of the weld with dye still present is shown in Fig. 87. Note that the crack, as

indicated by the dark color, extends almost completely around the weld. There is also an area where

penetration of the root pass was incomplete. We propose that the cracks formed as the weld was made,
because of the poor fit-up of the parts to be welded. The welds were not stress relieved, and the fact that
the cracks did not penetrate further attests to the lack of stress and crevice corrosion by lithium-beryllium
fluoride salts.

We did not section the outlet well, but we did clean the weld and examine it with dye penetrant. No
cracks were observed. ) oo

The outside surface of the 5-in. pipe was exposed to air and was oxidized. Figure 88 shows the spotty
nature of the oxide and its maximum thickness of about 3 mils.

A cross section from the bottom of the well was examined. A macroscopic view of this section is shown
in Fig. 89. The inside of the well was prepared by drilling, and the pointed shape of the drill is still apparent
at the bottom. The weld metal deposit on the bottom was made to ensure that salt did not leak along the
carbide stringers. The amount of oxidation was greater at the bottom of the well than further up. The
transition to the thinner oxide about % in. from the bottom is apparent in Fig. 89. Figure 90(a) shows the

oxide layer of about 5 mils at the bottom of the well, and Fig. 90(b) shows the abrupt transition about %

in. from the bottom. Since lubricant would have been used during drilling, we suggest that this difference
may have been due to the bottom of the well not being as clean as the sides.

A further significant observation was that the surfaces of the well exposed to the salt looked q quite
similar to those of surveillance samples removed from the MSRE (Fig. 91). We have previously attributed
this modified surface structure to cold working from machining and have shown that it can be produced in
the absence of salt. The structure likely results from carbide forming o on the slip bands produced by
machining. Thus there is no evidence of corrosion of this part.

Summary of Observations

The surfaces of the radiator (tubes and thermocouple wells) that were exposed to air formed a shallow
adherent oxide, while the surfaces exposed to salt were clean and showed no evidence of corrosion. Two
slight modifications of microstructure were noted. A shallow layer on the inside surface of the tubing
etched more readily, and we attribute this to contamination of the tubing by fabrication lubricants. A
structural modification near the surface of the machined thermocouple well was similar to that noted on
surveillance specimens and is attributed to the effects of cold working on carbide precipitation.

The cracked weld where the inlet thermocouple well was attached to the 5-in. pipe header likely
resulted from poor fit of the parts during welding. The crack probably formed when the weld was being
made, and it is encouraging that it did not propagate further during service.

SUMMARY

The Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment operated above 500°C for 30,807 hr and was filled with fuel salt
for 21,040 hr. Operation of the system was never detained by materials problems, but the examination of
INOR-8 and graphite surveillance samples during operation and several components after operation resulted
in several important observations.

1. Graphite exhibited excellent compatibility with the fuel salt. Machining marks and numbers were
clearly visible, with no evidence of chemical interaction with the fuel salt.

2. The INOR-8 surveillance specimens clearly demonstrated a progressive decrease in the creep ductility
with increasing fluence. The MSRE vessel did not become brittle enough to cause termination of operation,
but an alloy with better resistance to embrittlement by neutron irradiation will be necessary for power
reactors with a 30-year design lifetime. Considerable progress has been made in developing a modification
of INOR-8 that contains 2% Ti and has improved resistance to embrittlement.3*

3. The INOR-8 surveillance samples and components removed from the fuel salt were slightly
discolored, but no evidence of corrosion could be detected by standard metallographic examination. The
selective removal of chromium and iron from metal from the core was detectable by the electron
microprobe. No composition gradients were detectable in metal from the coolant circuit. (The coolant salt
did not contain uranium.) Thus the corrosion rate was very low in the fuel circuit, and this observation
agrees well with the chemical changes observed in the fuel salt.3®

4. Some of the INOR-8 surfaces showed shallow microstructural modifications, One type involved
increased carbide precipitation in a lamellar pattern and was likely due to cold working from machining,
The second type was noted only on tubing and was likely due to carbon contamination from fabrication.
Neither modification is thought to be of practical significance.

5. Grain-boundary embrittlement was noted on all INOR-8 surfaces exposed to fuel salt. The shallow
intergranular cracks were often visible in polished sections of INOR-8 as removed from the MSRE. In most
instances the material had to be strained to make the cracks visible. Cracking similar to that noted in the
MSRE was produced in laboratory experiments by exposure of INOR-8 to the fission product tellurium.3”
This experimental work has shown that the extent of cracking is very dependent on the alloy composition.

6. Freeze valve 105 failed from thermal fatigue due to improper construction and not from a basic
materials problem.

7. A crack was noted in the weld that attached the thermocouple well to the radiator coolant salt
header. This crack was restricted to the root pass and was likely a result of poor fit-up of the parts. The
crack probably formed when the weld was made and did not propagate during service.

8. Oxide films were formed on all the INOR-8 surfaces exposed to air or the cell environment of
nitrogen containing 2 to 5% O,. The oxide generally consisted of a uniform surface layer about 1 mil thick
and a selective oxidation front extending to a depth of 4 or 5 mils. This depth and type of oxidation are
what would be expected for an alloy that contains only 7% Cr, such as INOR-8.

9. A copper sample capsule that had been in the fuel salt pump bowl for several thousand hours was
very brittle. Chemical analysis showed that constituents of the fuel salt and INOR-8 had penetrated the
copper, but the element responsible for the embrittlement was not identified.

~ ACKNOWLEDGMENT

The observations in this report cover several years and include contributions from many individuals.
W. H. Cook and A. Taboada designed the surveillance fixture, and W. H. Cook was responsible for its
assembly and disassembly. The MSRE operations staff, headed by P. N. Haubenreich, exercised extreme
care in handling the surveillance fixture and in removing the various components for examination. The
Hot-Cell Operation Staff, headed by E. M. King, developed several special tools and techniques for various
examinations and tests of materials from the MSRE. The metallography was performed by H. R. Tinch,
E.H. Lee, N.M. Atchley, and E.R. Boyd. The microprobe scans were made by T. J. Henson and R. S.
Crouse. The mechanical property tests were performed by B. C. Williams, H. W. Kline, J. W. Chumley, L. G.
Ratdon, and J. C. Feltner. The chemical analyses were performed under the supervision of W. R. Laing,
E. 1. Wyatt, and J. Carter. Assistance was received from several members of the Reactor Chemistry Division
in several phases of this work. J. W. Koger, J. R. DiStefano, P. N. Haubenreich, and J. R. Weir reviewed the
manuscript of this report and made many helpful suggestions. Kathy Gardner made the original drafts of
this report, and the drawings were prepared by the Graphic Arts Department.
