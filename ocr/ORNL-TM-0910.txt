PREFACE

A record of the methods of maintaining the radioactive portions

of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) is presented in this
report. In Section 2, overall descriptions are given of the components
and the methods of maintenance. Section 3 presents the procedures
written from the standpoint of the people who perform the work. The
Appendix lists reference material that will be useful when detailed

information is required.

The report was originally prepared before the MSRE began power
operation and thus before there was any experience in radioactive
maintenance of it. Since that time, the MSRE has been operated and
maintained successfully, and we have had the opportunity to observe
how our maintenance plans have worked. In general, our basic methods
and original planning have served quite well.

There is one aspect of our experience, however, that bears on
the material contained herein. We have found that changes in tools,
methods, reactor equipment, and administration of the maintenance
operation make it necessary to prepare new and fully detailed
procedures for most shutdown work. These procedures are then used
to implement the functioning of a complex operation involving many
people. Therefore the procedures in this report reflect present
methods but not the full detail that is actually required.

ABSTRACT

A record of the methods of maintaining the radio-
active portions of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment
(MSRE) is presented. The maintenance system utilizes
long-handled tools operated through a movable shield
for most of the in-cell manipulations. For some
radioactive transfer and setup tasks that cannot be
handled otherwise, a crane that is operated remotely
from a shielded control room is used. Overall
descriptions are given of the components and the
methods of maintenance, the procedures written from
the standpoint of the people who perform the work are
presented. Reference material that will be useful
when detailed information is required is included.

.1. INTRODUCTION

: 235
The MSRE is a 7.5-Mwt circulating-fuel reactor in which =~ U

fuel dissolved in a solution of lithium and beryllium fluorides
is pumped around a closed loop at 1200°F. A drawing of the reactor
arrangement is shown in Fig. 1. The reactor plant was completely

-described in this series of reports by Robertson,” Some of the

advantages of this reactor concept are related directly to the
liquid nature of the fuel and are due to the ase of moving the
bulk of the fuel inside piping systems, removing reactor poisons,
reprocessing to remove fission products, and adding new fissionable
material to make up for burnup. However, the same liquid property
causes radioactivity to be distributed throughout the primary
systems. Therefore special means are required for maintaining all
the equipment that comes in contact with or is physically near the

* fuel salt and off-gas systems. The demonstration of capability in

this area became one of the primary objectives of the program.

The maintenance system includes many different kinds of
equipment located both in and out of the radioactive areas. Besides
physical equipment, a certain amount of information must also be
considered as part of our maintenance system. This information

‘exists as written procedures, drawings, photographs, and "know-how"

of trained experienced personnel,

Early in the program it was recognized that the design of each
component had to include provisions for maintenance, and the steps
in the achievment of this goal included a design surveillance

- program. Thus those who had the maintenance responsibility had an

opportunity to influence the system and component design in the
early stages. This activity took varying degrees of participation
from consultation and approval to detailed designs and layouts.
Surveillance of the design was followed by a similar program during

‘the construction, assembly, and installation stages. Accompanying

the field work of installing reactor components was & demonstration
and practice program in which selected components were handled with
remote-maintenance tools and methods. Many corrections were made
during this period to improve the basic designs and to correct
fabrication errors and maintenance techniques. In general, the
process consisted of doing whatever was necessary to make the system

maintainable. The surveillance program and the demonstration

program were logical methods of assuring the maintainability of the
system before power operation. These programs had the further
result of producing a nucleous of experienced personnel at the
beginning of power operation at the MSRE, which has since been
expanded in the course of several shutdowns to an adequate and

competent group. The recognition of the individual component nature
of the maintenance problem, the design and construction surveillance
effort, the demonstration program at the reactor, and the utilization
of developed personnel skills are parts of the approach used to assure
the maintainebility of the MSRE.

 
 

 

 

2. DESCRIPTION OF THE MAINTENANCE SYSTEM

2.1 Maintenance Equi pment and General Methods

The system provided to maintain the MSRE is based on the
requirement that any failed component be replaceable with a new
interchangeable spare. Decontamination and subsequent repair of
failed components have been found to be possible and economically
attractive. However, decontamination and repair are not considered
to be the primary methods. for maintenance. ‘Little effort has been
made to effect in-place repair. A major effort was made however
to achieve good component reliability. As the result of a combination
of many influences, the maintenance system was made flexible, simple,
rugged, and low cost. All the equipment that can be approached
directly is designed for conventional maintenance. This report is
concerned only with the equipment that cannot be approached directly
because of radioactivity. :

The four principal locations where remote maintenance is required
are the reactor cell, the drain tank cell, the venthouse, where there
is access to the off-gas system components, and the fuel-processing
cell. Fairly uniform methods are used for all these cells. The
ability to remove and replace every operating component in these .
areas has been accomplished through the use of appropriate disconnects
and mountings. The 5-in. circulating-system piping is joined by
mechanical disconnects consisting of the freeze flange developed
especially for molten-salt service. The 1-1/2-in..fill-and-drain
system piping is of all-welded construction. Future Joints will
be made by cutting and brazing with a technique developed especially
for this service. Piping conducting other fluids is connected by
ring-joint flanges or cone-seal disconnects. Electrical and instrument
wiring has plug-in disconnects constructed of materials suited to:
the environment. All the joints and disconnects are designed to be
readily operable from directly overhead. They are described in detail
later. The major components, such as the reactor vessel, the heat
exchanger, the pump, and the drain tank, as well as the smaller
components, such as the pipe and vessel heaters, valves, and motors,
are so disposed and mounted that after being disconnected - they can
be removed by lifting straight upward.

The maintenance equipment design provides for the operation of
all the disconnects and the replacement of the smaller components
by the use of relatively simple long-handled tools operated directly
through the portable maintenance shield. The portable maintenance
shield can be placed over and will cover the opening left by the
removal of two of the lower shield plugs, a space 4 ft. wide and up
"to 10 long. There are a variety of penetrations for inserting
lighting, viewing devices, and tools. An opening can also be
created through which small components will pass. A penetration
may be placed anywhere in the opening covered by the shield by a

series of controlled movements. The design and use of the portable
maintenance shield are described in detail later. The major components
are too large to pass through an opening 4 ft. wide and their removal
thus requires that a large portion of the cell top shielding be
removed and that remote~handling techniques be used. For this
operation, a shielded maintenance control room, remotely operated
cranes, and closed-circuit television were provided. The maintenance
control roam (Fig. 2) overlooks the reactor cell, the drain tank cell,
and the building interior through shielding windows. It contains
controls for the 30-ton crane, the 10-ton crane, and the monitors for

the television system. Lift fixtures are provided that can be picked

up by crane and which, in turn, will pick up, transport, and release
the lower shield blocks and beams and each of the major components.

2.2 Maintenance Control Room and Facilities for Remote Operation

The maintenance control room and facilities for remote operation
consist of the remote maintenance control room; 30- and 10-ton cranes
operable from the control room; lift tongs for the lower shield blocks
for the reactor cell and drain-tank cell; lift fixtures for the
reactor vessel, heat exchanger, fuel pump, and drain tanks; and a
closed-circuit television system. The remote facilities are to be
used during any maintenance operation that requires the simultaneous
removal of more than two lower shield blocks. Anticipated operations
in this category are replacement of the reactor vessel, the heat
exchanger, the pump bowl, and the drain and flush tanks.

The maintenance control room has 3-1/2-ft-thick concrete walls
to provide adequate shielding for any maintenance operation; three

* windows to provide a view of the cells and building interior; crane,
television, and lighting controls; and radiation monitors, ventilation,

sanitary facilities and lights. Its floor is 10 ft. above the building
main floor and its interior dimensions are 14 by 19 ft. Personnel
access to the room is by an outside stairway on the west side of the

building. Equipment access is by a Ut x 4-ft batch in the ceiling.

The ten-ton crane has five speeds in each of six directions

controllable directly from a push-button pendant in the main building

or from a dial and toggle-switch console in the maintenance control
room. ~The signals from the maintenance comtrol room.to the crane
travel via a trailing cable that must be connected by a cannon-type
plug located at the west end of the bridge when remote control is
desired; it is disconnected at all other times. This crane was

_ rereeved for a hook travel from 875 ft 10-1/2 in. to 823 ft 6 in. elevetion

and is now actually rated at 1-1/2 tons.

The 30-ton crane nas five ‘speeds in each direction controllable
from the cab and three speeds in each direction controllable from
a dial and toggle-switch console in the maintenance control room.
It also has a power-driven rotating hook controllable from either
point, and a load cell with an indicator in the maintenance control

hl

room. The remote-control signals are transmitted via trolley wire
and need not be disconnected. The main circuit breeker for both
cranes is in a shielded: area under the maintenance control room and
is accessible during a remote-maintenance operation.

There are four-point (Fig. 3) and two-point lifting tongs for
the lower shield blocks, and a lifting tong for the lower shield
beams. The bails fit the hook of the 30-ton crane. The tongs lock

. alternately in the open and closed positions each time they are

picked up and set down. The sequence of operationsfor the tongs is

as follows: engage the crane hock in the bail and raise the tongs

(now locked in the open position); lower the tongs onto the plug

with the hooks in the lifting points until the tong weight is off

the crane; raise the tongs, which will automatically lock in the closed
position, ‘and raise the shield plug; transport the load and lower it

until the tong weight is off the crane hook; raise the tongs, which

will now automatically lock in the open position, and release the
load.

A lifting fixture is provided for each of the major components.
Each fixture can be picked up and released by the crane and can in
turn pick up and release its component through use of the remotely
operated crane. These fixtures are on hand and have been used.

The television system consists of three cameras mounted on
pan and tilt mechanisms, two monitors, and a set of controls. For
a remote-maintenance operation the cameras are mounted in the
building on movable stands, as shown in Fig. 4, so as to command
two views of the operation which, along with the direct view through
the shielding window, provide complete coverage of the work area.
The use of orthogonal positioning of the cameras provides a feeling
of depth. The remote controls operate the pan, tilt, focus, zoom,
and iris.

2.3 Portable Maintenance Shield

A portable maintenance shield was designed and fabricated to
provide shielding for maintenance operations with long-handled tools.
It shields the access area produced when any two adjacent lower roof
blocks are removed from the reactor or the drain tank cells, It
accommodates the long-handled tools, the lower shield blocks in both

reactor and drain tank cells, and scme of the in-cell equipment, and

it is operated from the remote-maintenance control room. Figures

5 through 8 show various views of this equipment. ‘
‘The portable maintenance shield consists of four basic components:

slide, modules, frame, and track. The slide is a slab of shielding

whose dimensions are 12 in. thick by 5 ft wide and either 8-1/2 or

13 ft long dépending on the usage. The slide includes a circular

cutout that accommodates a 35-in.~diam. geared plug. The plug,

in turn, has a series of cutouts for lights, windows, and tools.

The slide rolls on wheels and is moved by a drive motor.

The filler modules are additional short sections of shielding .
that can be added to the main slide to allow positioning of tool holes
above the desired work area. Most of the long-handled tool operations
are done through a module referred to as the rotating work plug. «
This module, which is assembled next to the slide, contains a 22-in.
diameter rotatable-plug mounted eccentrically within a 50-in.-diam.
plug. This arrangement provides the necessary reach to permit tool
© access over any point within the block opening. A special hole layout
within the inner plug permits multiple tool access to the reactor freeze
flanges, as specifically required for flange maintenance. The plugs
are operated manually through a geared drive to allow precise
positioning of their multiple openings. A tool access cutout is
located on the edge of the rotating work plug to provide means of
inserting or withdrawing large tools or items of equipment. This is
sometimes called the "split section of the rotating plug." All
modules and plugs are 12 in. thick and fabricated from carbon steel. ’

The frame, constructed of heavy steel plate, serves as the
support for the slide. After the frame is installed over a pair -
of lower shield blocks, the slide is moved to an end track to permit
the removal of the blocks, and an opening 52 by 127 in. is provided.
The plugs are removed by operating the cranes from the remote-
maintenance control room and then returning the slide to a position .
over the cell opening to provide complete shielding for personnel. :
A 3/4-hp motor and gearbox combination mounted on the frame moves
the slide through a rack-and-pinion arrangement. The rate of travel o
is about 2 in./sec. ' Electrical limit stops, backed up by movable
mechanical stops, are provided to limit travel as desired. The motor
controls are connected to the maintenance control room operating station
with a cable. - .

The track is an extension to the frame that can be mounted at
either end of the frame and on which the slide and module rollers
move. It consists of "I" beams with channel and angle bracing.

A shielding thickness of 12 in. of steel is provided throughout
(slides, modules, and frame sides and ends). This shielding is
sufficient to limit radiation levels 24 hr following reactor shutdown
to about 10 mr/hr.

The series of holes through the shielding that are used for long-
handled tools, lights, and windows are provided with various fillers
or inserts. Some of these contain 150-w lighting fixtures. Some

are of a split -bushing design to accommodate tools of various :
diameters. - Some inserts contain a drilled lead ball through which :
tools may be inserted and "swung" into positions other than directly o
underneath the work hole. One 8-in.-diam. and one 5-1/2 in.-diam. _

lead-glass window can be mounted simultaneously for direct viewing. Oo

2.4 Jigs and Fixtures for Assembling MSRE Components

The philosophy of remcte maintenance involves the replacement
of failed components; therefore connection members and mounting
dimensions must be the same for the failed and the replacement.
components. Jigs and fixtures are used to make it possible to
replace the major components in the reactor and drain-tank cells.
The following components were fitted to a jig as they were assembled
or, a jig was fabricated to fit the as-built component.

2.4.1 Reactor Cell Components

~ The ma jor reactor cell components that can be removed and
replaced are the reactor vessel, the heat exchanger, the pump bowl,
the rotary element of the pump, and the pump motor. A jig was
designed for these major components so that all replacement
components could be fabricated on the cone jig assembly, or the jig
could be broken down into sections to accommodate single components.
A separate jig is available for use if only the pump rotary element
or the pump is to be replaced. This jig makes it possible to
duplicate the auxiliary flanges and disconnects in their existing
locations. After the space coolers were installed in the reactor
and drain tank cells and all piping and electrical connections were
made, they were removed and a jig was built to fit the unit. This
jig makes it possible to duplicate the flange and electrical disconnects,
as well as the support steel for the unit.

The basic parts of a jig were also prepared for the component
cooling valves. After the valves were installed and all piping was
completed the valves were removed and placed on the jigs, and holes
were drilled to locate flanges, air lines, disconnects, etc. These
holes were identified for each valve and thus any valve in the
system can be duplicated.

2.4.2 Drain-Tank Cell Components

A jig was used to assemble the drain tanks and steam domes,
and the elevations and orientations of all piping flanges and
thermocouple disconnects were established with fixtures attached
to the jig. The fill-and-flush tank was assembled in the same jig,
and the helium valves were fitted to the valve jig described for
the component cooling-air valves.

2. 5 Ereeze-Flange Maintenance

The major component s in “the reactor cell are connected by the
five 5-in. freeze flanges described previously by Robertson.

2
Op. cit., Ref. 1, pp 178-189.

 
 

16

-

These flanges are designed so that they can be separated and remade

remotely with tooling operated through the portable maintenance shield.

The layout of the reactor system piping, imposed by other factors, .
dictates that the sequence of opening the flanges for replacement of

any component be limited to opening the flanges on the coolant end

of the heat exchanger first, then on the fuel end of the heat exchanger, -
and finally the flange that connects the reactor to the suction of -

the pump. This sequence is responsible for the rather lengthy

procedure required to remove a defective gasket in freeze flange

FF 100, and must be taken into aceount whenever Planning a specific

maintenance task. : ; So *

2.5.1 Operations Required for Gasket Replacement

The operations of breaking and meking a flanged joint involve:
the following procedure, which is broken down into steps corresponding
to the tool used. The disassembly consists of

1. Forcing clamp off the flange and thus relieving all gasket
sealing force,

2. Hanging the clamp assembly on & bracket installed in the cell,

3. Jacking the faces of the flanges apart to get at the ‘gasket and
to provide clearance for displacing components. .

4. Removing the ring-gasket assembly,
5. Covering the open flanges 10 prevent spread of contsmination.

The reassembly procedure, which is the reverse of the above,
and which is done with the same tools, has one extra requirement:
the flange faces must be realigned as they are being jacked together
(reverse of step 3) to assure good gasket sealing. Throughout these
steps, viewing is provided principally by the periscope, with its
various lenses. The periscope is supplemented by windows in the
shield and, when necessary, by long-handled mirrors.

2.5.2 Realignment and Gasket Sealing

The freeze flange assembly, which is shown in Fig. 9, consists
of the flange body containing the gasket groove, the gasket assembly,
the clamps, the guide rods, the disassembly beams, and the lifting
eyes. The gasket loading force is derived from the strain in the
horseshoe section of the clemp, which is sprung open a nominal
0.100 in. when the clamp is forced onto the flange. Forces encountered
in seating the clamp on assembly and disassembly operations range
from 16 to 34 toms. It is necessary to put the clamps on symmetrically »
for two reasons. First, symmetrical loading produces the best —
gasket -sealing condition, and second, unsymmetrical assembly would -
cause galling and "digging in" and thereby increase the required

assembly forces. Symmetrical assembly is achieved by using care in :

handling and operating the remote tooling. Also there-are guide

rods that help center the clamp through their close engagement with *
the ears on the flange. The guide rods also serve to connect the }

upper and lower half of the clamp assembly so that it can be handled

as one unit. The disassembly beams carry the loads imparted by “
the remote tooling from the clamps into the flange when taking the

clamps off. The lift eyes are provided to handle the clamp assembly.

2. 5 3 Permanently Installed Maintenance Equipment

Some items of equipment that in general serve to simplify the
remote maintenance operation were permanently installed at each
freeze flange. For example, under the piping at each flange there
is a 5-ton worm-gear screw jack that terminates in a remotely operable
“hex head, complete with hook, supports, and drive trains. This
jack provides forces in the axial direction of the piping to spread:
-apart or bring together the flange faces. There are also permanently
installed, slotted brackets that act as anchor points to align flange
faces in the radial direction, and there are supports that hold the
freeze-flange clamp assembly in the stowed position when the flanges
are separated.

2.5.4 Hydraulic Clamp Operator

 

"

As mentioned above, the horseshoe-shaped section of a fully seated
clamp is sprung open a nominal 0.100 in. to produce a gasket load
of approximately 200,000 1b. The force required to seat a clamp x
ranges from 16 to 34 tons and is applied remotely by the pair of
hydraulic clamp operator tools shown in Fig. 10. Each consists of
a long mast carrying a 20-ton 13- 1/2 in. stroke hydraulic ram. Its
cylinder is attached to a stationary outer frame, and the piston
is attached to an inner frame. Extending the ram moves the inner
frame down toward the stationary member. By engaging the outer
frame under appropriate surfaces on the clamp assembly and the inner
frame over them, the tool can accomplish the required jobs: of ‘assembly
and disassembly. These are shown in Fig. 10. Engaging the tools
onto these surfaces remotely is made somewhat easier by aligning
assembly marks on the tool with the proper surface on the in-cell
equipment.

2.5.6 Clamp-Handling Tool

When the clemps have been separated, the "clamp handling" tool
is used to transport the clamp assembly out of the way and to store

it so that the flanges can be spread apart. This tool consists of *
a pair of hooks installed on the end of a long mast and spaced to

engage a pair of eyes on the upper clamp. When the hooks are engaged . »
the tool is raised slowly, and it lifts the upper clamp until it .
contacts the underside of the upper beam. Because of the restricted OW

vertical clearance between the guide-rod jaws and the flange ears,

the motion is precisely controlled until the entire weight of the

~ flange clamp assembly is carried by the tool. The assembly is then
‘moved horizontally back along the piping and bung on the slang stowing .
bracket, as shown in Figs. 9 and 11.

2.5. 7 Flange-Jacking Equipment . =

 

After the clamp assembly has been stowed the flanged joint may
be separated. This is accomplished with the jacks (Dwg. E-GG-E-41865)
mounted in the cell beneath the piping. As mentioned above, these
are 5-ton worm-gear screw jacks that are engaged and operated remotely
by rotating hex-head drives with ordinary socket wrenches on long
handles. The jack hook engages with and transmits force through jack
bars mounted on the piping-support installation (Dwg. E-GG-E-41860).

To avoid restricting the motion of the piping due to thermal expansion,
the jacks must be left disengaged during reactor operation. For
maintenance they must be engaged to the piping to provide the forces
required for opening flanges and for moving components.

2.5.8 Gasket-Handling Tool

 

The gasket handling tool is used to replace a ring-gasket assembly.
The tool is long-handled pliers with a stationary upper jaw. The
movable lower jaw which is operated from the top of the tool, engages
slots on the inside of the ring away from the four sealing surfaces.
On the vertical center line of the gasket there is a small bracket
that carries a pin to lock the gasket to the flange until the flanges

if

, ~ are pushed together. This detail is shown in Fig. 12. The pin has «

0.045 in. clearance inside a hole tapped in the flange at a corresponding
"location. Thus, the pin can .be slipped into the hole readily by
means of the handling tool. The pin has threads on its lower side
that match those of the hole, and the weight of the gasket assembly
is supported by the pin which is kept in place by the engaged threads.
When the other flange is brought into place the ring groove cams the
ring upward; this motion disengages the threads on the pin and the
tapped hole and allows the ring to move into the proper sealing
position in the groove. For removal, the assembly is raised so that
the smooth upper surface of the pin contacts the top of the hole.

This disengages the threads and allows the pin to be withdrawn.

2.5.9 Flange-Cover~-Handling Tocl

 

In order to reduce the release of radioactive particles from
the system and the extrance of air, covers are placed over the open
flanges. A cover consists of a steel plate with a raised gasket
surface, a wedge device for tightening it up against the flange face,.
a bracket to hang it on the flange ear, and a handling bail. The
cover is shown on drawing MSRE-SK-D-263. The seal occurs just inside . -
‘the ring gasket groove but outside the expected salt-cake area, and : —
it is not expected to be a high-quality seal. The handling tool (>

contains a hock with a lock and a pair of remotely operated sockets

for operating the wedge. The covers require 4 in. of clearance

. between the flange faces for remote installation. For freeze flange

FF-200 a special offset tool is required because the open flange

is under a shield support beam. Further, because of interferences

with the stowed clamp, the covers must be partly installed as the
flanges are being jacked apart. The handling tool, installed covers,
and stowed clamp are shown on Fig. 11.

2.6 Fuel-Pump Maintenance

The MSRE fuel pump is made up of the pump bowl, the rotary
element, and the motor stacked vertically and joined by bolted gasketed
Joints. The pump bowl assembly consists of the pump tank, the volute,
the suction and discharge lines from freeze flanges FF-100 to FF-101,
the furnace, the support plates, and a number of flanges for dis-
connecting the pump auxiliary systems. The rotary element consists
of the pump shaft, impeller, shield block, bearings, bearing housing,
and various auxiliary lines with flanges. The motor has a power
lead-in on top and two cooling water lines with flanges. All these
flanges for the pump auxiliaries are on a common radius from the
center line of the pump and are mounted at three specific elevations.
The bolts that hold the three units together are arranged to allow
the choice of removing first the motor and then the rotary element
or both of these together. Jacking screws are provided to force the
rotary element off the pump bowl in the event of a stuck gasket.

The procedure for removing either of the two upper parts is to
disconnect the electrical power lead and the auxiliary flanges, unscrew
all the pump flange bolts, and finally operate the jack bolts to
meke sure the parts will separate. The preparatory work is done
with long-handled socket wrenches and hooks inserted through the
portable shield. A lifting yoke is inserted through the split section
of the rotating plug and engaged in the trunnions provided on both
the motor and the bearing housing, and the unit is lifted clear of
all the close fitting attachments. The part is then lifted by the
crane until it is just below the portable maintenance shield. At this
point it is necessary to go into the remote-maintenance control room,
open the slide of the portable shield, and pull the part up into
the high bay for storage in one of the pits or for disposal. Plastic
covering or other containment is used to prevent contemination of the
high bay area. Installing a replacement part requires the reverse
of the removal procedure, with the addition of the extra care that
must be exercised when engaging the mating surfaces of the pump.

2.7 Graphite Sampler and Control Rods

The term "graphite sampler" refers to a collection of both
permanently installed and removable equipment used to maintain three
important components of the reactor that are physically located near
the center line of the core. These components are the graphite-
Hastelloy N surveillance samples, the 2-in. removable. graphite
stringers, and the control rods.

 
 

 

24

2.7.1 Surveillance Samples

 

Among the important results to be gained from operating the
MSRE are the chemical and metallurgical data to be obtained from
examining specimens of graphite and metal exposed in the central
region of the core for long periods of operation. (This program
has been described in detail.® ) Figure 13 shows features of the
sample assembly and its location in the core. This sample assembly,
which is roughly a 5-ft-long 2-in.-diam. cylinder, consists of an
array of graphite bars, Hastelloy N tensile specimens, and flux-
measuring wire inside a basket of perforated sheet metal. End
fittings accommodate installation, coolant flow, and handling
requirements. After exposure in the operating reactor, the
specimen is removed with long-handled tools and teken in a shielded
carrier to a hot cell where some of the samples are taken from the
basket for chemical and metallurgical examination. The basket is
then reloaded with new and exposed samples, returned to the reactor,
and reinstalled in the core.

The graphite sampler, which was designed primarily for the
operation of removing and replacing surveillance samples, is shown
in Fig. 14, and consists of the following. components:

1. A 48-in.-wide lower shield block, which has a 39-1/2-in.-
diam. hole over the center of the reactor vessel. During reactor
operation a filler plug is installed in the 39-1/2-in.-diam. hole.

2. A 20-in.-diam. standpipe attached to the.bottom of the
48-in. shield block by means of a flange and a bolting ring and to
the 2-1/2-in. reactor access flange. An expansion bellows is used
between the standpipe and the access flange to allow for movement
due to thermal expansion. The standpipe is attached slightly off
center at the top to leave access roam for control rod maintenance.

3. A cylinder 36-in. high by 47-1/2-in. in diameter with
b-in. thick walls (of canned-lead construction), which is installed

when preparing to teke a sample. This shield is sealed at the bottom

by the weight resting on a flat gasket. It is designated the
graphite-sampler work shield, but it is sometimes simply called the
work shield.

L. A geared work plug, 38-in. diam. by 10-1/2-in. thick,
is inserted into the work shield (item 3 above). This plug has a
Teflon ring that acts as a seal and bearing surface. The work plug
Fig. 15, has a smaller geared plug eccentric to the large plug,
and seven various sized tool plugs, viewing ports, and lighting
inserts. Teflon gaskets and neoprene "O" rings are used throughout

to make the overall assembly gastight.

5. The standpipe. atmosphere-control system. This consists of a
nitrogen supply, a control panel, an exhaust blower and a filter.
When items 1 through U4 are assembled, a sealed compartment is formed
above the reactor, through which personnel operating long-handled
tools, can open the reactor and withdraw a radioactive sample. By
feeding a purge of nitrogen into the compartment and maintaining a
negative pressure inside it, two purposes are served. Air is kept
out of the reactor vessel, and contamination is kept out of the
personnel working area.

6. Miscellaneous equipment. Once the shielding, containment,
and atmosphere control have been set up, the physical handling of the
in-cell equipment can proceed. With long-handled tools and a variety
of standard and special hardware, the reactor access port is Opened,
and the sample is withdrawn and put into a sealed container within °
the standpipe. The container is pulled upward out of the standpipe
into a carrier with 6-in.-thick shield walls for its trip to the
~ hot cell. In practice, a lengthy and detailed step-by-step written
procedure is followed by the personnel doing the work.

2.7.2 The 2-in. Graphite Core Stringers

There are five stringers (moderator blocks) located in the center
of the core that can be removed for examination. They are equipped
with fittings for handling. However, access to remove them is
gained only after the removal of the control rods and drive housings,
the substitution of a 36-in.-diam. standpipe for the 20-in. stand-
pipe, and finally the removal of the control-rod thimble assembly.
There are no plans to remove these stringers until the conclusion
of reactor operation. :

2.7.3 Control Rods

Figure 16 shows the top view of the three control rod drive
housings and the 20-in. standpipe. The control-rod access flange has
been removed. The view is similar to that of looking down through a
window in the graphite-sampler work plug. For maintenance the
control-rod drive housing is removed first. Induced radiation and
contamination of this unit is low so that repairs can be made with
~ ordinary-methods after minor cleanup. .A éontrol rod éan be

removed only after the drive housing is out of the way. The rods
have much induced activity and are generally replaced rather than
repaired. All the necessary work is done with long-handled tools.

2.8 Braze Joints

The ,1-1/2-in. Hastelloy N piping for the salt fill-and-drain
system is of all-welded construction. Component replacement is to be
accomplished by cutting the pipe at predetermined points, removing.

component with a prepared fitting, and brazing the Stub into the
fitting. The technique, as developed for the MSRE,” requires a
permanent 2-by 3-ft base plate located at each possible future joint,’
four tools that can be placed and operated through the maintenance
"shield, and a 4200-cps 30-kw induction generator.

Figure 17 shows an unassembled joint and a section of a brazed
joint. The in-cell pipe stub is machined to a taper, like the piece
on the right. The new component is installed with a prepared end,
like the piece shown on the left, and with the gold-nickel sheet-
metal braze preform, shown in the center, fastened in it. The two
are pressed together while being heated to 1900°F to form the completed
joint. Figure 18 is the positioning vise suspended from its lifting
bail. It is lowered over a continuous piece of pipe, positioned
on the base plate by dowels, bolted down, and the three-jaw chuck is
closed to grip the pipe. Figure 19 shows the pipe cutter in operation.
It is lowered, in the open position, over a continuous piece of pipe
and onto its mounting plate on the positioning vise. The knife is
fed into contact with the pipe and the cutter is rotated, with
automatic knife feed, until the pipe is cut. The cutter is then

"removed. After the component is completely disconnected and removed
the taper cutter is placed on the base plate, Fig. 20. The taper
cutter is driven through an extension shaft by an air motor while
the positioning vise is used to drive the pipe stub into it. A
6° included-angle taper l-in. long is machined on the pipe. The
taper cutter is then removed, and the furnace with induction heating
leads and purge-gas connection is placed on the pipe stub as shown
in the left side of Fig. 21. The new component with the prepared
braze fitting, thermocouples, and furnace end piece is put into
place. The fixed vise is then lowered over the pipe, fastened to
the base plate, and closed to grip the pipe as in the right side of

Fig. 21. The positioning vise is then operated to drive the stub
into the braze fitting so that matching tapers jam. The furnace .
is closed as in Fig. 22 and the inert gas purge is begun. After an
appropriate purge period, the induction’generator is turned on and
the joint is heated to 1700°F in about 2 min. Axial pressure is
maintained on the joint with the positioning vise during heating,
and at about 1750°F the braze metal melts and the pipe stub travels
about 1/8-in. further in. This reduces the joint thickness from
0.005 to less than 0,001 in. The joint is held at 1900°F for about
one minute to assure complete melting and wetting and then permitted
to cool. The furnace is then opened, the thermocouples are removed,
and the joint is inspected. If the joint does not pass inspection,
the furnace can be closed, the joint heated to 1900°F and separated.
If it does pass inspection, the furnace is removed by breaking up the
insulation and cutting loose the coils, the vises are removed, and the
line is restored to service. : :

2.9 Maintenance of the Sampler-Enricher

 

*

The sampler-enricher system provides the means whereby samples
of salt are removed from the reactor for analysis and additions are
made to enrich or poison the fuel, This system was described in
more detail previously. A shell of 8-in. of lead has been built
around the equipment for shielding during reactor operation. Portions
of this shell must be removed for access, and other portions are
utilized as shielding during maintenance. The maximum source
strength can be assumed to be no more than that of 2 radioactive

i

- samples of salt. (Presumably one sample would be associated with
-.the equipment failure and the other due to the accumulation of

deposits and spills from the routine handling of many samples.)

A radiation level of 400 r/hr at 12 in, has been estimated for this.

The arrangement of the-components of the sampler is such that
there are seven distinct areas that may be worked on more or less
independently. The operating panel board and parts are shown in
Figs. 23 and 2h. Maintenance will be accomplished with hand tools
and direct methods with advantage taken of the shielding that can be
provided by local stacking of lead bricks. The designs of the
connectors, fasteners, and movable shielding have, to a large extent,
facilitated this approach, When the particular unit has been
disconnected, it will be transported to a decontamination cell to
be cleaned up as much as possible before further work. Distance,
shadow shielding, and the maintenance control room will be used,
depending on the radiation: level and the complexity. of the particular

~ task,

2.10 Miscellaneous Long-fiandled Tools

 

2. 10. 1 Heater and Termocouple Maintenance Tools

The tools for the mainterence of the heaters and the thermocouple

disconnects are, in general, long-handled lifting hooks working .

inside a centering guide or socket. In operation the hook is engaged

in the bail on the equipment and the socket is brought down over

the bail to lock it inside the tool. At this point the unit is
transported and released at its destination. The tool is then
removed. The heaters and electrical disconnects have identical
bails, which fit the socket on the end of the tool. The thermocouple

"disconnect tool however requires. a different-sized socket and, in

addition, a frame of guide rails attached to the socket which acts
in aligning the two halves: of the disconnect before the. electrical
contacts have ° engaged. .

2.10.2 Leak-Detector Disconnect Wrench and Handling Tool

A remotely operable joint consisting of a pair of mating
conical surfaces forced together by a single bolt mounted in a
pivoted yoke is used in the MSRE in the leak detector lines and
in pneumatic lines that feed the weigh cells in the drain tank
cell. This joint is known as the leak-detector disconnect. The
procedure to disconnect it is to use the leak detector disconnect
wrench to unscrew the bolt, and with the attached hook, to pivot.
the yoke back out of the way. Then by using the same tool as a
long handled "C" clamp, the pipe or tube that comes into the top
of the disconnect is grasped, separated from its mate, and moved
clear of the area. In the case where it is necessary to hold both
parts of the joint, an additional "C" clamp tool is utilized.

3, DETAILED MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES

The operating procedure in a radioactive maintenance situation,

in the interest of safety and economy, includes

(1) the maintenance operation and the tools involved,
(2) the protection of personnel and equipment,

(3) ‘the manipulation of reactor equipment, such as the
ventilation system, and

(4) the measures required to maintain cleanliness both in
the cell and in the high-bay area.

Details of a procedure depend on knowledge of the reactor, its
operating history, the effects of its radioactivity, and the main-

' tenance operations. It would be impractical to try to anticipate

all the needs of a procedure; therefore, the procedures that follow
pertain only to the operation of the maintenance tools, and the

check out of the equipment for function, calibration, and defects.

In general, attention to detail and good cooperation among all involved
are required for good results.

The verb "insert" as used in the procedures refers to the entire
operation, which consists of picking up the tool on the crane, threading
it through the proper hole in the portable shield, carefully lowering
it into position with whatever manipulations are required to clear
in-cell equipment and finally using the proper bushing to close up
the gap in the shielding.

Motion or displacement of the tools or equipment is accomplished
generally by moving the portable shield with the tool attached to it.
Motions in the “long direction of the shield blocks (east and west in
the reactor cell and the drain tank cell) are simple translations
of the slide. Motions across the slide are made with a more complex
combination of plug rotation and slide translation. Small movements
may be accomplished by utilizing the clearance between the outside
of the mast of the tool and the hole in the shield into which it is
inserted. The long tools with relatively heavy lower ends act very

‘much like pendulums, so the operator cannot exert total, positive

control. For this reason all movements of these tools must be made
as slowly, smoothly, and deliberately as possible to retain control,
avoid violent: oscillations, and prevent damage to equipment.

3.1 The Radiation and Contamination Problem

Radiation and contamination levels vary widely in the MSRE.
There are situations where tools can be inserted and removed repeatedly
without becoming radioactive, and there are also occasions in which
everything in the vicinity of the operation will be highly

 
 

42

contaminated. Therefore no one simple written procedure will
adequately cover all situations. However, the following guide lines
are generally applicable:

1. Written health physics procedures and precautions must be
provided for each job.

‘2. A health physicist must be present at the start of each
operation to survey and to evaluate hazards. :

3. Anything below the shielding (i.e., in a radioactive area)
must be assumed to be a radioactive hazard until proven otherwise.
It must be wiped, monitored, and/or. contained as it is being pulited
up through the shield.

4. Techniques for contamination control, such as containment
and personnel shielding, must be considered during the preparation
of ‘the remote-maintenance procedures.

9. Radioactive, contaminated equipment can be disposed of in
several ways. It can be taken to the hot-equipment storage cell or
the decontamination cell at the MSRE, the radiodctive burial ground
on a hot truck, or to any of a number of hot cells at ORNL. The
choice depends on a number of factors, such as the value of the
part, the use of the part, how radioactive it is, and what
facilities are available for handling it. However, containment
must be provided to prevent the spread of airborne contemination,
and shielding must be provided for gemma radiation to protect
personnel.

3.2 Maintenance Control Room and Remote Facilities

The maintenance control room is used for limited operations;
for example when it is necessary to move highly radioactive materials
from one cell to another or out of the high-bay area of the building,
and when openings made in the shielding are so large that the resulting
radiation levels preclude normal occupancy of the high-bay area.
During the actual use of the maintenance control room, all operations
must be accomplished by using the two cranes and, further, the high
bay may not be accessible. Complete inaccessibility represents an
extreme situation. Usually the high-bay area can be entered, and
personnel using distance and/or shadow shielding to reduce exposure
can work for short times to assist with operations and to remedy
troubles. :

Because this work presents special hazards, the following should
be done to assure that the operation proceeds smoothly:

1. The written procedure should be gone over thoroughly before
starting to check that the procedure is workable and that all
necessary equipment (1ift fixtures, camera and light stands,

equipment supports, etc.) aré on hand and are located where the

 

©

”

43

crane hooks can get to them.

2. All the operating equipment should be tested just prior to
the actual operation. The cranes should be operated in all directions,
at all the control settings. The lift fixtures should be visually
inspected, lubricated, and tested under load. Television cameras and
lights should all be warmed up. and functioning, and for a test they
should be moved about with the crane to demonstrate their portability.

3. During operation there should be at least three people but
less than seven in the maintenance control room.

4. After completing the maintenance operations, the high bay
should be thoroughly surveyed by the health physicist and contamination
should be cleaned up before semidirect operations are resumed.

3.3 Procedure for Use with the Portable Maintenance Shield

Detailed procedures are outlined on Dwg. LL-D-DL0663, MSRE
Main Cell Plan View Shield Setups Reference Drawing, and on Dwg.
LL-D-D40669, MSRE Drain Tank Cell Plan View Shield Setup Reference
Drawing. Ten separate drawings (LL-D-D-40663 through LL-D-D-L0672)
are available that show the many possible setups to be used in
specific locations, including drawing LL-D-D-L0668, Shield Setups
Over MSRE Freeze Flanges.

3

The usual procedures for use with the maintenance facility are
listed in the sequence of preparations, operations, and closuré¢ as.
follows:

3.3.1 Preparations

1. Select proper setup drawing to determine applicable shield,
module, plug, and track component requirements.

2. Remove sufficient upper roof blocks to allow lower roof
blocks to be lifted out. -

3. Cut membrane (1/8-1n. stainless steel).

4. Set the frame over “the lower roof blocks to be removed.
(Setup as determined in Step 1, above). Allow 3/4-in minimum
side-and-end clearances ‘for the lower roof plugs to be pulled
through. .

-5.. Attach tracks: and motor base. Level tracks with shims as
required. Place slide and module arrangements as indicated on the
reference drawing.

 

 

 
 

 

3.3.2 Operations

1. Verify the following by opérating the slide with the motor
drive: ;

\

a. that sufficient clearance exists for removing the blocks,

b. that the device which couples the slide to the rotating
~ work plug operates, and

c. that the slide travels smoothly on the frame and the
track,’

2. Clear the opening in the frame for lower shield block removal.

3. Attach the block-1ifting tongs to one of the blocks to be
removed. a .

4. Connect the motor drive power lead into the remote-maintenance
room receptacle (located on the wall just west of the reactor cell).

5. Evacuate the high-bay area and continue the operation from
the remote-maintenance control room.

6. Remove both shield blocks through the frame to a designated
parking area. This operation can be done with the crane operator
watching through the windows and one man observing the weigh-cell
indicator.

7. Energize the slide drive motor, and return the slide to
cover the cell opening. Return to the high bay.

8. Use as many modules as required to keep the cell opening
covered. :

-9. Move the rotating work plug over the desired area and
proceed with semidirect operations.

10. To handle large pieces of equipment, the slide and rotating
work plug are separated, the equipment hanging on a long-handled
tool is passed through the opening, and the slide is closed around
the mast of the tool at the cutout built into the edge of the
rotating plug. Depending on the radiation level, some of these
operations may have to be done from the remote-maintenance control

room.

3.3.3 Closure¥*

1. Remove all long-handled tools, close holes, and clear the
top of the slide and rotating work plug.

*The purpose of this operation is to replace the lower shield
blocks in the roof of the cell.

2. Locate the slide so that it alone covers the opening in the
frame. :
3. Uncouple the slide from the rotating work plug.

Lh, Connect the motor drive power lead into the remote-
maintenance control room receptacle.

5. Bvacuate the high-bay ares and continue procedure from the
remote-maintenance control room.

6. Energize the slide drive motor and move the slide until
the opening is uncovered. 7

T. Replace both shield blocks into their places in the roof
of the cell.

8. Return to the high bay.

3.4 Procedures for Using Freeze-Flange Manipulating Tools
3.4.1 Hydraulic Clamp Operator

3.4.1.1 Equipment Required. The portable maintenance shield
must be set up with the special freeze-flange rotating plug (see

. Dwg. LL-D-40668), periscope with sheath, rod light, left-hand and

right-hand hydraulic clamp operating tools with pump, an A frame,
and an overhead crane, (See Fig. 9 for flange nomenclature. )

. 3.4.1.2 | Assembling the Clamps Onto the Flange

1. Insert the periscope with the right-angle lens in a convenient:
hole. . Lower it until it is locking at the top disassembly beam.

2. Insert one hydraulic tool with the jaws opened to the
calibration marks on the inner and outer frames.

<

} 3. Lower the tool till the upper jaw (the movable one) is Just
above the upper surface of the clamp ear. The lower stationary jaw
is then under the ear on the lower clamp.

RN Engage the tool by moving it horizontally toward the flange.

This may. be done with a lever-like action with the mast of the tool

used as the lever and the portable shield as the fulcrum.
5. ‘Repeat steps 2, 3, and 4 for the other side.
6. Attach the hydraulic pumps to the fitting on top of the mast.

T. Operate the pumps to force the two clamp halves together.
While the tool's upper Jjaw moves, the lower jaw is stationary,

 
 

46

therefore the mast must be raised to compensate for this. ' The entire
process is monitored with the use of the periscope to make adjustments
in the travel of the clamp to keep it level and to keep the spacing
between the clamps uniform. )

8. Disengage the tools and remove them from the cell.
. 3.4.1.3 Removing the Bottom Clamp from the Flange

1. Insert the periscope with the right-angle lens in a convenient
hole. Lower it until it is looking at the top disassembly. beam.

2. Insert one hydraulic tool with the Jaws opened to the proper
calibration mark.

3. Lower the tool till the upper Jaw (the movable one) is Just
above the upper surface of the lower clamp ear. This is between
the two clamps and approximately on the center line of the flange.
The lower jaw of the tool, the stationary one, is then under the
proper surface of the lower bean.

i, Engage the tool by moving it horizontally toward the flange.
This may be done with a lever-like action with the mast of the tool
used as the lever and the portable shield as the fulcrum.

5. Repeat steps 2, 3, and 4 for the other side.

6. Attach the hydraulic pumps at the fitting on the top of the
mast.

T. Operate the pumps to force the lower clamp off the flange.
This should require approximately 2 in. of power stroke and then
the clamp should fall of its own weight. A provision is made on
the tool for catching the clamp. The tool is then lowered until the
lower clamp is resting on the beam.

8. Disengage the tools and remove them from the cell.

3.4.1.4 Removing the Top Clemp from the Flange

1. Insert the periscope, with the right-angle lens in a
convenient hole. Lower it until it is locking at the top disassembly

beam.

2. Insert one hydraulic tool with the Jaws opened to the proper,
‘calibration mark.

3. Lower the tool until the upper jaw (the movable one) is
Just above the proper surface of the top disassembly beam and the
lower stationary jaw is under the upper clamp.

47

i. Engage the tool by moving it horizontally toward the flange.
This is done with a lever-like action with the mast of the tool used
as the lever and the portable shield as the fulcrum.

5. Repeat steps 2, 3, and 4 for the other side.
6. Attach the hydreulic pumps et the fitting on top of the mast.
T. Operate the pumps to force the upper clamp off of the flange.
8. Disengage the tools and remove them from the cell.
3.4.2 The Clamp-Handling Tool

1. Insert the tool directly over the center of the flange (in
the plan view).

2. Engage the hooks on the tool in the eyes on the upper clamp.

3. Lift the top clamp until it begins to pick up on the top
disassembly beam.

4. Raise the clamp assembly very slowly. When the slack has
been taken out of the pin joint between the beam and the guide rod
the tool is supporting the weight of the entire clamp assembly and
there is onlyl/8 in. vertical clearance between the guide rod jaws
and the flange ears, Thus a movement of 1/16 in. is required to
gain clearance to move the clamp.

5. When the clamp assembly is free of the flange, move the tool
horizontally along the center line of the pipe toward the clamp
stowing bracket. At the instant the lifting motion frees the
restriction, the clamp assembly will probably come off the flange
ears in a twisting motion so that one side is upstream and the other

~ side is downstream. When this occurs move the clamp assembly over
‘so that the offending side may be swung outboard and around the

flange ear. The same method: applies when the entire clamp assembly
is on the wrong side of the. flange.

6. Raise the tool “enough to clear the front edge of the stowing
bracket. Move the clamp assembly back ‘against the stop on ‘the stowing
bracket and lower it into place.

7. Before releasing the hook examine the clamp's position with
all available means (monocular through window in portable shield,
periscope, and auxiliary mirrors) to assure that it is seated properly
on the bracket.

8. Disengage the tool and remove it from the cell.

3.4.3 Flange Jacking and’ Aligning Tools

3.4.3.1 Equipment Required. The jacking system consists of in-
cell equipment at each flange operated by simple rotation of two
hex-head screws. One screw operates the jack that generates the

. push-pull forces and, in general, is located outboard of the other

screw, which operates a latch bar used only for the pulling operation.
‘Both hex heads are the same size (1-1/2 in. across the flats), and
they are located close to one another. Drawing E-GG-E-41878 should
be consulted to assure that the operator can identify each screw.
All the Jack operators will push the flange closed when turned clock-
wise. Operation of the latch bar varies, and the installation drawing
should be consulted for each installation.

3.4.3.2 Pulling the Flanges Apart -

 

1. Insert the tool onto the jack hex head.

2. Rotate until contact is made between the bar on the pipe
support and the pad on the jaw of the jack. This operation should
be viewed, whenever possible, with the periscope.

3+ Remove tool from the jack hex: head and engage it onto the
hook hex head.

4, Rotate to close the hook latch around the jack bar to permit
pulling with the Jack. This should never require high torque, and
if high torques are encountered, they indicate that the stop has
been reached or that there is a malfunction which should be in-
vestigated. . -~

5. Switch the hook back to the jack hex head and rotate counter
clockwise to pull the flanges apart. In this case the torque is
proportional to the load.

6. Remove the tool.

© 3.4.3.3 Pushing the Flanges Together While Using the Pipe-Alignment
Tool

1. Insert tool onto jack hex head and rotate clockwise until
there is only 1 in. between flange faces.

2. Insert pipe aligning tool so that the arrow-head-shaped
guide on the tool will go into the slot in the pipe-aligning bracket.

3. Rotate the tool toward the flange, and adjust the height
and the horizontal distance of the pin on the tool until it is
aligned with the hole in the ear of the flange.

4, Engage the pin in the flange ear.

5. Using the drive rods on top of the tool, raise, lower, or
align the flange being jacked with its mate. Check this with the -
viewing equipment.

6. Resume pushing with the Jack operator, and adjust the
alignment as necessary until the flanges are seated.

T. Back the jack hook L in. away from the bar on the support
to avoid restriction to thermal-expansion movements.

8. Remove the tools.
3.4.4 The Gasket-Handling Tool
3.4.4.1 Removing an Existing Gasket

1. With the flanges spread apart 4 in, or more, lower the
gasket-handling todl, with jaws open, into the space between the
flanges on the center line of the pipe.

“2 Using the periscope with the right-angle lens and binoculars
from above, carefully line up the tool and the vertical center line
of the gasket. o ,

3. Move the tool horizontally into position with the upper
Jaw approximately 1/4 in. above the locking-pin bracket.

yk, Lower the tool 80 that the upper Jaw contacts the locking
pin bracket.

5. Slowly move the lower jaw up into locking position by
lowering the handle on the upper end of the tool. Lock the tool
to the gasket through the engagement of the lower jaws in slots
in the ring.

6. Raise the tool: slightly to clear the threads on the locking
pin and move the tool, with the gasket, back from the flange face.

A minimm of 1-1/2 in. travel is required to clear the male guide

on the flange.
~-T. Raise the nails det it clears the flange.
8. Gasket and tool are now ready for the "hot pull" operation.
3.4.4.2 Installing a New Gasket | |

1. Install the new gasket in the jaws of the gasket-handling
tool, and make sure that it is securely placed.

 
 

: 50
2. Lower the gasket into the space between the open flanges
until the locking pin is in line with the tapped hole in the flange.

3. Move horizontally, and insert the pin into the tapped hole.
(The gasket should always be installed on the down-hill flange.)

4, Lower the assembly onto the threads of the locking pin.
- 5¢ Open the jaws on the tool. |

6. Raise the tool approximately 1/4 in. .
T. Move the tool avay from the gasket."

8. Raise the tool carefully so that it does not hang on the
installed gasket and is clear of the flange.

9. Remove the tool from the cell,

3.4.5 The Flange-Cover-Handling Tool

 

‘3.4.5.1 Installing Flange Covers

1. Place the cover for the male flange in the tool securely,
and make sure that the wedges are fully retracted (i.e., maximum
opening in the bracket).

2. Lower it into the cell between the open flanges until the
rim of the cover is past the male guide.

3. Move horizontally toward the flange so that the ‘bracket
hooks over the ears on the flange and then lower it until it is
seated there. ’ }

L, Release the hook and lower the tool so that the sockets .
engage the hex heads.

5. Tighten up the cover by rotating the hex heads counter-
clockwise.

6. Disengage the tool and remove it from the cell.
T. Repeat entire sequence for the female flange.
3.4.5.2 Removing Flange Covers

5. Repeat sequence for male cover.
3.5 Fuel-Pump Maintenance
3. 5, 1 Removing the Fuel-Pump Motor
1. Drain and blow out auxiliary lines.

2. Di sconnect auxiliary flanges, electrical power, and thermo-
couple leads and stow.

3. ‘Loosen the bolts holding the motor housing to the rotary
element housing. Use a torque indicator on the socket extension
tool.

4. Remove all tools except the periscope.
5. Insert pump lifting yoke through split in portable shield.
6. Engage hooks on yoke in trunnions on motor.

7. Record two items of information to be used in the replacement
operation:

(a) the elevation of the mast with respect to the operating
floor and

(bv) the azimuth location of the center line of the crane
‘hook.

8. Lift the motor straight up to a position beneath the portable

shield. There is engagement between rotary element and motor for

the first 7 in. of this travel.

9. If the radioactivity level requires it, evacuate the high-.
vay area and continue the operation from inside the shielded remote-
maintenance control room.

10. Open the slide on the portable shield and pull the motor up
with the crane and take it to the storage area.

3.5.2 Removing the Fuel-Punp Rotary Element
1. Drain and blow out auxiliary lines.
2. Disconnect auxiliary flanges, thermocouple, ‘and speed indicator.

3. Loosen the bolts holding the housing to the pump bowl.

 
 

52

4, Remove all tools except periscope.
5« Insert pump-lifting yoke through split in portable shield.
6. Engage hooks on yoke in trunnions on rotary element.
T. Record for use in- “the replacement operation the elevation
of the mast with respect to the operating. f floor and the azimuth of the

crane hook.

- 8. The initial 1ift is accomplished by screwing the 4 jack

bolts on the outer bolt circle .déwn against the pump bowl flange.

This Jacks the rotary element up and off the bowl.

9. Lift the rotary element straight up to a position beneath
the shield. The lowest part of the impeller does not clear the pump
flange until after the first 22-1/2 in. of travel, so the lifting
must be done slowly and carefully.

10. If the radioactivity level requires it, evacuate the high-
bay area and continue the operation from inside the shielded remcte-

maintenance control room.

. 11. Open the slide on the portable shield, pull the rotary
element up with the crane, and take it to the storage area.

12. Install pump bowl cover.
3.5.3 Replacing the Fuel-Pump Rotary Element
1. Remove the pump bowl cover plate.

2. Pick up the new unit on the crane with the lifting yoke -
oriented in reactor position. Locate the crane over the center line
of the pump from measurements made in the removal process.

3. Open the portable maintenance shield, (from the control room,
if necessary), and lower the tool and new wit. Close the Shield.
as soon as the round mast section is in the shield.

hk. Proceed with semidirect techniques. Insert periscope.

5. Lower the rotary element down onto the pump bowl. -The last
22-1/2 in. of travel must be slow, since the impeller enters the
bore of the pump bowl flange at this point. To assist the operation,
there should be on hand a drawing showing how the rotary element

- fits the pump bowl. This is to be used with appropriate calibration

marks on the tool, which are referenced to the elevation mark of the
final seated position of the: rotary element.

yoke oriented in reactor position. Locate the crane over the center
line of the pump from measurements made in the removal process.

2, Open the portable maintenance shield (from the control room
if necessary), and lower the tool and motor. Close shield as soon
as the round mast section is in the shield.

3. Proceed with semidirect techniques. Insert periscope.

lk, Lower the motor onto the rotary element. At the start of
the last 7 in. of travel, pins in the motor housing engage a
slotted cone on top of the rotary element to provide radial guidance.
At the last 2 in. of travel the mating parts of the splined coupling
engage. If the splines meet tooth to tooth, it is necessary to
twist the motor through the clearance between the pin and the
slots in the cones. This is sufficient to allow the splines to mate

properly.

5. Torque the flange bolts to the desired loading according
to a torque indicator on the long-handled sockets.

6. Reconnect all auxiliaries.

3.6.2 Replacing the Surveillance Sample in the Core

The process of replacing the surveillance sample in the core
consists basically of the reverse of the removal process. A list
of the general activities is given below.

1. The sample is transferred out of the shielded carrier into
the standpipe.

2. An inert atmosphere is established in the standpipe.

3. The reactor access is opened and the sample is transferred
into the core.

4, The holddown assembly is reinstalled. The flange must pass"
the standard leak test. :

5. The thermocouple and air-cooling lines are reconnected.

6. The equipment and long-handled tools are removed from the
standpipe. .

T. The standpipe and the various pieces of shielding are ‘put
back into the condition for reactor operation.

3.6.3 Procedures for Removing and Replacing the 2-in. Square
Graphite Stringers

In order to remove and replace the 2-in. square graphite
stringers (Dwg. BB-B-4O416, Items 7, 60, and 61) in the center
of the core, the same control must be maintained over the leakage
into or out of the reactor, the cell, and the working area as that
used while removing the surveillance sample assembly. An additional
standpipe large enough to accommodate the removal and replacement
of these stringers has been designed and fabricated (Dwg. D-BB-C-40659).

The following are the necessary steps for the installation of
the standpipe and the subsequent removal of the graphite:

1. Drain and flush the reactor system, and bleed off the
pressure.

2. Remove 5 upper shield blocks.

3. Go through the entire procedure for removing the surveillance
sample assembly with two exceptions. Insert a dummy with an: appropriate
handling fitting in place of the usual sample assembly. Remove
the flange and holddown assembly and substitute a blind flange.

14. Place dummy stringers in the three empty spaces left by
the control rod thimbles to prevent the other stringers from getting
out of ‘position. ’ = : N

15. Remove the spacer fitting that nolds the tops of the five
graphite stringers, and stow it in the bottom of the standpipe.
There are several options from here on depending upon how many
samples are to be removed, the type of replacement, the timing
(how long between removal and replacement), and other operations
that are likely, such as inspection and retrieval of material
from the core.

16. Remove one stringer and place in an empty container. The
fitting on top of the stringer. is a male ‘half of a ick-diseomnect
fitting.

17. Transfer lid from container with new stringer to the one
with an exposed stringer.

3.6.4 Removing Control Rod Units

Access to the control rod units has been provided through the
upper flange of the 20-in. graphite-sampler standpipe. The following
general procedure is used for removing parts of the control rod and
drive assembly.

1. Remove five upper roof plugs.

2, Assemble the following tools: (a) the work shield (Dwg.
E-BB-C-40646, items 1 and 2; (see also Figs. 15 and 16), (b) work
plug and associated tool holders, viewing ports, light receptacles,
etc. (see assembly drawing E-BB-C-L0646), (c) wrenches and
extension handles for bolts, disconnects, etc. on the drive assembly;
install the short tools in the work plug.

3. Blanket the area around the work area with plastic sheet and
set up air monitors and other health physics equipment.

access port and place on top of access flange listed above. This
requires loosening U4 captive hex-head bolts.

9. Lower the extension wrench into position and disconnect the
two captive bolts connecting the drive unit to the control rod. These
two bolts have hex socket heads with funnel-shaped guides.

10. Disconnect the 3 captive bolts that attach the drive unit
lower flange to the rod thimble flange. Remove the extension wrench.

C11. Replace the rod drive access flange removed in step 8. Bolt
it down. : .

12. Lower a pickup hook through the split section of the rotating
work Plug.

13. Engage hook in 1ift ‘bail and pull housing up slowly.

"14. Open the portable maintenance shield at the split section
and complete the pull.

15. Use plastic bags to contain any loose contamination.

. Replacement of the control-rod drive housing consists of doing
the above procedure in the reverse order. However, when the repair’
to the drive mechanism has been completed it must be assembled with
a new control-rod-thimble flange-seal ring and with only one captive
screw in the flange that connects the drive to the rod. Also the
following steps are required to attach the control rod to ‘the drive.
These steps replace step 9.

a. Insert the threaded rod tool into the drive housing and
thread it through one of the threaded holes in the flange on the
drive. It will go completely through these thread until the -smooth
shank on the tool is in the threads.

b. Lower it until it gets to the control rod.

Cc. Screw it into the threads on the control rod.

d. Pull the control rod upward as Tar : as it will come.

‘e. Insert the wrench tool onto the captive bolt on the other
side of the flange.

h. Insert the remaining captive bolt on the end of a wrench
- tool and screw 1t into the control rod.

i. The rod is now joined to the drive. The tools may be *
withdrawn. Continue procedure at step 8. oo :

3.6.5 Removing the Control Rod

16. Insert a threaded tool in the threads on the control-rod
flange. ‘

17. Lift control rod to within L ft of the bottom of the
portable maintenance shield.

N - | J

18. Clamp off tool and cut off excess length of tool.

19. Pull the control rod into a plastic bag. The upper end will
not be too radioactive, but the lower end that has been in the reactor
will be very hot, probably above 200 r/hr, and ‘precautions must be
taken to deal with this source.

20. Dispose of the control rod or drop it into a shielded carrier.

Replacement of the control rod is accomplished with the reverse
of the above procedure, steps 1 to 20.

3.7 i Procedure for Brazing a Joint

The tools and equipment listed below are required for brazing
a joint.

1. Equipment put into cell for brazing operation:

a. positioning vise
b. fixed vise

¢. pipe cutter

d. pipe taperer

e. furnace

2. Long-handled tools used:

a. handling tool

b. extension wrench

c. extension drive

d. furnace installation hook

e. air motor (no. 315R Chicago, pneumatic, Cat. 22-387-3283). .

3. Auxiliary equipment and supplies used external to cell only
for brazing operation: }

0,

a. l-ton chain hoist
b. Ajax 3200-cps 30-kw induction generator
 

”"

63

c. 25-ft induction heating leads
d. pure argon or helium with drier
 e. 2000°F indicating or recording instruments for the joint
thermocouples
f. one complete dummy female braze fitting with 18-in. nipple

Lk. General-purpose equipment:

“a. 10-ton crane
b. meintenance shield.

Perform a test braze in the following manner to determine that
the equipment is in working order and to qualify the procedure:

‘1. Inspect all tools and equipment to make sure they are on
hand, clean, and in working order. The pipe cutter knife must read
R.C. 6 or better on the blade. :

2. Mount the positioning vise on the spare base plate. Put a
piece of 1 1/2-in. Hastelloy N pipe in the positioning vise and
clemp it tightly. Mount the cutter and cut the pipe. The proper
procedure for cutting is the following:

a. Rotate the tool drive until the knife feed wheel is up.
b. Feed the knife in until it is snug on the pipe.

c. Rotate the tool until the knife feed wheel contacts the
pin but does not pass it.

d. Rotate the tool back until the wheel touches from the
other side,

€. Make four complete oscillations and then pass the pin to
advance the knife feed, :

f. Continue in this fashion (four oscillations and then
a revolution) until the pipe is cut. The progress of the cut and
the condition of the knife can be determined from the torque (feel)

~ of the tool drive and should be observed carefully during the

practice cut.

ge Feed the knife all the way out, rotate the ool so that
the opening is down, and remove the tool from the vise.

: h. Examine “the cutter knife, and if it is not demaged, use
it for the in-cell operation.

J]

 
 

64

3. Position the vise all the way to the back (i.e., away from
' the slide feed nuts), and mount the pipe taperer on the base plate.
_ While turning the taperer drive by hand advance the pipe into the
cutter by moving the positioning vise forward until you feel the

cut begin.” This is the starting point of the tapering cut. Carefully .

mark the position of the feed handle and count revolutions from.this
point. Place the air motor on the taperer drive, set the pressure
to 25 psi, and turn on the air motor. It is necessary to hold the
air motor by hand to feel the torque and to advance the vise feed
by the torque feel. Too heavy a feed will result in chipped cutter
teeth. The operation should take 2 to 3 hr. After the feed has
advanced 5 1/2 turns, the cut is complete. Let the air motor run
10 min with no further feeding to obtain a smooth finish. Back the
pipe out. Remove the taperer. Clean the taper with a thoroughly
degreased brush. Do not touch the machined surface with Snything
else, . A finger-print will produce an unbonded area.

4. Slide the furnace over the tapered stub.

5. Thoroughly degrease the dummy female braze fitting with
thermcouples and furnace end attached, as well as the braze preform.
Assemble the preform into the fitting and fasten it with seversdl
spot welds. Use white gloves and extreme care. A fingerprint will
cause an unbonded area. :

6. Clamp the fitting in the fixed vise so that the end of the
fitting projects 4 1/2-in. past the end of the jaws. Place the
vise on the base plate and bolt it down.

T. Bottom the pipe stub in the fitting by operating the
positioning vise and then back the stub out one-fourth turn for a
purge gap. Close the furnace over the joint. Place pipe plugs
in the pipe ends. Connect argon purge to.the furnace and one pipe
plug. Purge at 40 cfh. Connect the thermocouple leads to the
indicators. Connect the furnace leads to the Ajax generator.

‘Set the capacitor control to 15. Start the machine, bring it up
to about 5 kw to heat the joint to 500°F, and then adjust the
power to hold the joint at 500°F while purging for 1 hr to bake
out and off-gas the system. Adjust the capacitor control if
necessary to obtain a power factor of one at 5 kw.

8. Operate the positioning vise to firmly seat the stub in
‘the fitting. While one operator maintains pressure on the
positioning vise drive, the second operator raises the machine
power to 60 amp, which results in readings of approximately 140 v
and 11 kw, The joint heats to 1750°F in about 1 1/2 min, at which
time the vise operator drives the stub in 1/8 in. or about three-
fourths turn and again seats the stub firmly in the fitting. The
machine operator watches the temperature indicator carefully, and
when the temperature reaches 1900°F, he immediately cuts the power:
to 3 to 4 kw and carefully adjusts it to hold 1900°F-for 1 min.

C

O,
 

 

 

65

Then he turns the power of f and permits the Joint to cool. The vise
~ operator holds pressure on the joint throughout the operation and
until the joint cools to 600°F.

9. After the joint has.cooled, it is removed and inspected.

If the operation was successful, the equipment and operators
are ready to proceed to the remote braze in accordance with the
following: :

10. Set the portable maintenance shield over the braze point
and remove the pipe heaters and any other interferences. Attach
the chain hoist to the crane.

11. Put the positioning vise in its full forward position
with its jaws fully open. Attach the 20-ft lift bail to the chain
hoist and to the vise. Suspend the vise over the base plate
oriented so it will grip the pipe that is to remain in the cell.
Open the shield slide,‘ lower the vise through, and close the shield
on the lift rod. Lower the vise by use of the chain hoist and
carefully set it on the base plate while guiding the dowels into
their holes. Disengage and remove the 1ift bail. Insert the
extension wrench and bolt the vise to the base plate. Operate
the positioning drive to center the vise in its travel as indicated
by marks. Close the jaws on the pipe tightly. If the pipe slips
in the jaws during s later operation, the reference point will be
lost.

12. Attach the lift bail to the chain hoist and to the pipe
cutter. Suspend the cutter over its mounting plate on the vise.
Make sure the cutter is in the open position so that it will pass
over the pipe. Open the shield slide, lower the cutter, and close
the slide on the bail rod. Lower the cutter and guide it onto the
mounting plate (the plate is 3° off vertical). Use the chain
hoist for final lowering. Disconnect and remove the lift bail.
Insert the extension wrench. Turn the cutter drive until the knife
feed wheel is up. Put the extension wrench in the feed wheel and
© fit the cutter knife snugly onto the pipe (counterclockwise).

Cut the pipe following the procedure in.paragraphs 2 c. through 2 e,
and remove the cutter as in paragraph 2g. 5

13. With the extension wrench, operate the positioning vise
drive 11 turns to the rear so that the pipe stub will be clear for
later operations.

“1h. ‘Complete the disconnection and removal of the component
"by the appropriate procedures. :

 
 

 

 

 

66

15. Examine the pipe taperer to be sure‘it is clean, the cutter
is in good condition, and the brush and pilot ball assembly is tack-
welded and cannot come off. Attach the lift bail to the chain hoist
and the taperer and insert it through the maintenance shield, Lower
it onto the base plate, remove the lift bail, and bolt it down.
Perform the tapering operation as in paragraph 3; however, note ~
in addition, the total number of turns of the positioning vise from

its position in paragraph 13 to the completion of the cut and return .

the vise to that position after the completion of the cut. Remove
the taperer from the cell. Gross particulate contamination is to
be expected.

16. Examine the furnace carefully. Attach the induction heating
leads, the purge gas line, and the handling bail, and tie off the
leads and purge line to the top of the bail. Attach the bail to
the chain fall, and insert the furnace in the cell. Carefully slide
the furnace over the stub and against the plate of the vise.. Untie
the leads from the bail and secure them on the shield. Remove the
bail. Thoroughly degrease the nylon brush which will pass over the
pipe stub, attach the long handle to it, insert it into the cell,
and brush off the machined surface. Remove the brush.

17. Examine the new component to assure that ‘the braze fitting
1s accurately located, is clean, the braze preform is in place,
the thermocouples with 25-ft flexible leads coiled on the furnace
bail are in place and checked electrically, and the furnace end with
thermocouple leads is in place. Install the new component by
appropriate procedures.

18. Examine the fixed vise to see that it is operating
properly and that the jaws are fully open. Attach the lift bail
to the chain hoist and to the vise, and insert it into the cell.
Place it on-the base plate very carefully to avoid striking the
furnace end. Remove the lift bail, bolt down the vise, and clamp
the vise Jaws on the pipe tightly.

19. Retrieve the thermocouple leads with the retrieval hook.

20. Proceed with the braze as in steps 7 and 8 with the generator

power settings obtained in the test braze. The purge to the inside -
of the pipe will have to be inserted at some convenient place in
the salt system. In the case of a drain-tank replacement, the
“normal helium connection to the drain tank can be used.

21. After the joint is completed, open the furnace and examine
the joint visually with the periscope to check the quality of the
fillet and wetting around the joint. Then inspect it with ultrasonic
tools and techniques provided by the Metals and Ceramics Division.

22. Destructively remove the furnace, and then remove the tools.

3.8 _ Procedures for Maintenance of the Sampler-Enricher

There are nine parts of the sampler-enricher that will be in
contact with the radioactive salt. Therefore radiation will be a
factor at the time of maintenance. The specific parts are (1) the
inner compartment, (2) the manipulator arm assembly, (3) the removal
seal assembly, (U4) the light bulb, (5) ‘the maintenance valve, (6) the
operational valve, (7) the hot vacuum pump, (8) the containment
housing, and (9) the spool piece connecting the pump bowl with the
sempler. Except for items 5, 6, and 8, these items are independent
and can be removed from the assembly by themselves. Item 5, the
maintenance valve cannot be removed without first removing items
1 and 6. Similarly, item 6 cannot be removed without removal of 1.
Parts of the sampler-enricher are shown in Figs. 23 and 2L.

Radiation levels affecting maintenance will depend on the duration
and power levels of reactor operation, the amount of spillage, deposits
from gaseous activity, and whether there is a radioactive sample within
the sampler that must be removed in a nonroutine manner. Thus, the
range of conditions that might be encountered is large. While the
reactor is operating, approximately 8 in. of lead shielding covers
the unit. This provides protection for personnel during the normal
sampling operation. The shielding is mostly in the form of stacked
lead brick. Several cast prices are used where complex shapes are
needed. Doors and windows were built into the shell for maintenance
access.

A generalized version of the maintenance procedure follows.
Details for each individual piece of equipment vary and have to be
applied as required. Item 9, the spool piece, however, is an
“exception because it is located within the reactor shield; the
portable maintenance shield and long-handled tools are used for
maintaining it. :

1. Shut down the equipment. This includes the reactor and the
various subsystems of the -sampler-enricher.

‘2. Remove shield blocks to give clearance and working room.

3. Gather, clean, and prepare tools, shielded carriers, equipment,
and the decontamination cell. = :

hk, Spread out blotter paper and plastic, and set up contamination
control measures for the high bay.

5. Remove outer pieces of shielding.

6. Take health physics precautions throughout remainder of
procedure. - '

 
 

 

. 68

T. Decontaminate as much as possible and pass cleaning swabs
through the removal seal assembly by using the sampler-enricher
manipulator to pickup the radioactive material.

8. Remove sufficient shielding for access to the attachments.

9. Disconnect mechanical, electrical, and piping connections.
Use hand tools, extensions, and stacked lead brick shielding.
Radiation surveys should be made to locate and correct local streaming.

10. Attach lifting devices.

11. Rig shielded carrier and plastic bags to encase the equipment
as it clears the structure of the sampler.

12. Transport to decontamination cell for cleanup.

13. Decontaminate and repair the unit. If decontamination is
not possible, prepare a new replacement.

14. Install the repaired or the new component.
15. Reconnect all fittings and attachments.

16. Replace the shielding.
