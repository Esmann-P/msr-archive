ABSTRACT

A fluoride volatility process for recovering enriched uranium
from UF -NaF-ZrF) melts, produced by the dissolution of reactor
fuel elements in molten NaF-ZrF) through hydrofluorinastion, is
described. The UF) is fluorinated to UFg, which volatilizes, and
is separated from volatile fission products in a NaF absorption-
desorption cycle. In laboratory studies gross beta and gamms
decontamination factors of 10° with a uranium loss of less than
0.1% were secured. The product UFE may be conveniently returned
to UF) or metal for further use as reactor fuel,

Chemical studies; supplementary to process development work,
showed that impurities, possibly oxides, have a much greater effect
in the fused salt-fluorination step than such factors as use of
nitrogen with the fluorine, or the method of introducing the
fluorine into the fluoride melt. The colloidal behavior of NiFp,
a slightly soluble corrosion product formed in the fluorination,
indicated that this material would not interfere in molten salt
handling if the fused salt was not allowed to stand without
agitation for prolonged periods. The absorption of UFg in NaF
was found to be due to the formation of a UFg-NaF complex. The
equilibrium between gasecus UFg and selid complex was established
for the temperature range of 80 to 320°C. Decomposition of the
UFg-NaF complex to a UFg-NeoF complex does not lead to appreciable
uranium loss in the process if specified process conditions are
maintained.

1-0 INTRODUCTION

A new approach to processing of enriched uranium civilian
power reactor fuels by a fluoride volatility method has been
reported. ts 2 The method consists in three steps: dissolution
of the metal or elloy in a fluoride melt by bhydrofluorination,
volatilization of UFg from the molten selt through fluorination,
and final purification of the UFg from volatile or evtrained
fission product fluorides by absorption or distillation. A
typical salt composition is 50-50 mole % NeF-ZrF), with a melting
point of about 510°C. The second step eoppears feasible with use
of either elementel fluorine or bromine pentafluoride. The ORNL
development program on this process has been directed toward use
of elemental fluorine in the second step and absorption of the
UFg on Ne¥ as a merns of completely decontemineting the UFg
product from fission product sctivity.

A practicable process flowsheet for the fused salt-fluorination
and NaF decontamination steps is described in this report slong with
the results of laboratory process test studies. In addition, the
status of some of the more basic development work carried on con
currently with the process studies is presented. This supporting
work bas included further study of the fluorination step, some of
the chemistry involved in the NeF decontamination process, and
exploratory work on the corrosion problem.

2.0 DESCRIFTION OF PROCESS

The recemmended flowsheet for the fused salt-veolatility process
(see Fig. 2.1) hes the following features:

Fused Salt-Fluorination Step

 

1. A Fo/ UF), mole ratio of 6/1 results in essentially complete
UFg volatilization at 600°C. The volatilization is over 90% complete
at a mole ratio of 3/1. If the fused salt contains an unusually bigh
oxygen content (oxy-compounds) a ccmpensatory amount of Fp is needed.

2. The optimm fluorination period is probably about 2 hr. For
a 10-kg hatch of uranium a Fo rate of 1.7 scfm is required. A higher
flow rate over a shorter period would increase the Fp efficiency at
the expense of encountering excessive mechanical entrainment of the
salt and a lower decontamination effectiveness. A lower flow rate
would only lead to magnification of the corrosion problem.

UFg STORAGE
NaF Absorption-Desorption Cycle

1. A NaF/U weight ratio (U being the total uranium being pro-
cessed) of 2/1 to 3/1 is needed in each of the two NaF beds. The
recommended grade of NaF is 12-20 mesh, prepared from pelletized
material (Harshaw Chemical Company). The NaF beds should be
preconditioned with a slow flow of Fp for 1 hr at 400°C before
process use.

2. The absorption cycle, using only the first bed, is carried
out at approximately 100°C. Operation on a large scale will result
in the bed temperature rising 50° or more due to heat of abscrption.
There is no reason why the temperature could not be closer to the
triple point of UFg (65°C) initially to partly compensate for this
effect,

3. Desorption of UFg from the first bed through the second
bed requires about 1 hr, using the same ¥, flow rate employed in
the absorption cycle. The desorption cycle consisted, in labora-
tory tests, of raising both NaF beds simultaneously from 100 to
LOOOC in about 0.5 hr, at which time the transfer of UF5 to the
cold trap system was essentially complete.

3.0 PROCESS DEVELOPMENT STUDIES

3.1 Fused Sslt-Fluorination Work

 

3.1.1 Fluorine Efficiency

When fluorine is introduced into fused Nal -Zr¥-UF), the uranium
content drops sharply as the Fp/U mole ratio increases (Fig. 3.1).
Fluorine utilization efficiency is highest when 90% or. more of the
UFg has been volatilized (Fig. 3.2). The efficiency decreases
thereafter, with the Fo acting essentially as a sweep gas. In an
ideal case, the amount of UF4 volatilized would be stoichiometrically
equivalent to the amount of Fo introduced up to a Fo/U mole ratio of
1, thereafter decreasing hypsrbolically.

The Fo/U mole ratio required for volstilizetion of more than 99%
of the UFg was decreased by the elimination of impurities, but it
was not significantly affected by the concentration of uranium in
the initial fused salt (Fig. 3.3).

Use of No with the Fp, the method of gas introduction into the
melt, and the rate of gas flow hes some effect on the Fo/U mole

ratio, but the results could not be correlated with the known
variables (Fig. 3.4).

These experiments were performed at 600°C in a 2-in.-dia
nickel reactor with a 375-g charge of NaF-Zr¥F) -UFy. In some of
the tests the salt was made by the addition of UFy to NaF-ZrF)
(50/46 mole ratio) that was believed to be relatively free of
oxide impurities as a result of previous use in a fluorination
run. Uranium tetrafluoride concentrations of 1, 2, and 4 mole %
were used to study the effect of concentration. In other tests
NaF-ZrF)-UF), (50-46-4 mole %) was used as received. Data were
obtained by direct sampling of the salt at intervals during the
fluorination, The curves were extrapolated to the 100% volatiliza-
tion point for comparison, but usually a sharp break was observed
in the curve between 95 and 100%, which extended the curve to higher
fluorine~to~uranium mole ratios for volatilization of the last traces
of UFg.

Volatilization of more than 99% of the UFg from as-received
NaF -ZrF), -UF}, required a fluorine-to-uranium mole ratio of about
3.1/1, which was reduced to about 2.2/1 by sparging with HF for
It hr before fluorination. In two tests with the fuel mixture
synthesized by adding UF}, with a uranium content of only 72.9%
(theoretical, 75.8%) to prefluorinated NaF-ZrF), the fluorine-to-
uranium mole ratio required for more than 99% Fg volatilization
was about 2.4/1. When very pure UF|, uranium assay of 76.2%, was
used, the fluorine-to-uranium mole ratio was 1.4/1, which represents
a fluorine utilization efficiency of about 70%.

A quick~freeze sampling technique was used in all of the fluori-
nation work. A comparison of sampling methods showed that agreement
to within 3% was obtained in uranium analyses of samples taken during
the course of fluorination experiments with the use of a dip ladle,
immersion of a solid rod into the fused salt to obtain a quick-freeze
sample, and samples taken after fluorination by grinding and sampling
the entire batch of salt. This study was made with three different
uranium concentratlons in the NaF-ZrF) salt, 8, 2, and 0.5 wt %.

3.1.2 Corrosion Studies

The corrosion of nickel test coupons and of a nickel vessel was
fairly low after 20 fused salt-fluorination runs at 650°C, confirming
previous work.” Since conditions changed continually during the
runs and since the various components of the vessel were attacked
to different degrees, a calculated over-all corrosion rate would
have no significance. However, it appears that a large number of
fluorination runs can be made in one reaction vessel before the

corrosion is 00 severe. A summary of the resistance of various
metals to fluorination conditions at high temperatures has been
reported elsewhere.

The "A" nickel reaction vessel was 2 in. in diameter. The
three test coupons were mounted in an upright position at the
bottom of the reaction vessel, as shown in Fig. 3.5, in suck a way
that one-third the surface ares of each coupon extended from the
liguid into the gas phase. The coupons were 3 in. long, 3/4 in.
wide, apd 1/4 in. thick. Two of the coupons were "A" nickel
(nominal composition: 99.4% Ni, 0.05% C), and one of them was
cut longitudinally and welded. The third coupon, which was "L"
nickel (nominal composition: 99.4% Ni, 0.01% C), was alsc cut
longitudinally and welded.

Each run was made with 200 g of NaF-ZxF)-UF) (50-46-4 mole %).
The time for a run varied from 4.58 to 0.83 hr, the reaction vessel
and the coupons being exposed to process conditions for a total of
30 hr. The fluorine flow rate varied from 50 to 300 ml/min and was
regulated so that 9.4 moles of fluorine was used per mole of uranium
in each run.

Corrosion of the welded coupons (both "A" and "L" nickel) was
somewhat greater than that of unwelded ones, but in both cases the
corrosion was of the solution type (Fig. 3.6), and there was fairly
uniform surface removal. Dimensional and weight-change analyses
also showed that corrosion. mey have been slightly greater in welded
than in unwelded coupons (Table 3.1). The most severe attack was
on the outer surface of the fluorine gas inlet tube in the vapor
zone (Fig. 3.7). It is very likely that this attack, about 2 in.
above the salt surface, was due to the frequent admission of atmos-
pheric moisture and oxygen Into the reactor possibly producing an
aqueous HF and oxidation attack when it was at an elevated tempera-
ture. The same type of attack did not occur at the reactor wall.
Corrosion on the Fo inlet tube in the liquid zone was more uniform
and varied from 4.0 to 7.5 mils in depth. The reaction vessel
showed nonuniform attack of 5 to 9 mils in both the liquid and gas
zones; in the region in combtact with molten salt the attack was of
a solution nature (Pig. 3.8).

3.1.3 Recovery Yield of UFg

 

Uranium hexafluoride recovery was more than 99.0% in the 20-run
corrosion series (Sec. 3.1.2). The recovery of uranium was high in
all runs (Table 3.2). The wrenium loss in the waste salt was con-
sistently lowest in the 50-min runs at the highest fluorine flow rate.
This result was possibly due to & smaller loss of fluorine in corrosion

in the short runs than in the long runs. Out of 3935 g of salt,
341 g of uranium was recovered as UFg, which corresponds to an
initial uranium content of 8.66%. Analyses of this batch of fuel
ranged from 8.30 to 8.76% uranium. Even if the higher value is
assumed, recovery was 99.0%.

3.1.4 Behavior of NiFp, in Corrosion

The behavior of NiFp in molten NaF-ZrF) and NaF-ZrFj-UF) systems
was studied to determine if the presence of this corrosion product
would form sludges which would interfere with salt transfers in the
fluoride volatility process. Although NiFo has been reported to be
fairly insoluble in this type of salt (approximately 0.2 wt % as Ni
at 600°C), at higher concentrations NiF, readily forms a viscous
dispersion which settles slowly. Based on thls observation, it was
concluded that NiF, concentrations up to 2 wt % would not interfere
with salt transfers unless the molten salt were permitted to stand,
unagitated, for long periods of time.

Anhydrous NiFp was added to molten NeF-ZrF) (50-50 mole %); the
mix was heated until a clear solution was obtained and then cooled
until turbidity reappeared. Solubility values (Table 3.3) estimated
by the disappearance of turbidity were in fairly good agreement with
those determined electrochemically on 53 mole % NaPF-U7% ZrFy salt.

Addition of as much as 6 wt % NiF, to molten NaF-ZrF), (50-50
mole %) at 600°C resulted in the formation of a viscous dispersion
which was fairly stable. Although some settling of NiFo was evident
after only 0.5 hr with an initial nickel concentration of 2 wb bs
complete settling had not occurred even after 72 hr (Table 3.4).
With 1 wt %, settling was more nearly complete at 72 hr since the
Ni¥o concentration and viscosity at the bottom could not increase
as much. The results for the NalF-ZrF|~UF) system appear very
similar to those for the uranium-free system (Table 345) However,
with 2 wt % Ni and with uranium present the settling was less after
2 hr than in the test with no uranium. Since the solubility of Ni¥Fo
is represented by the lower limit of nickel concentration encountered
in the settling tests, it appears to be approximately the same in
uraniun-bearing and uranium-free salt.

The tests were made by dry mixing the required amount of salt
(~ 30 g), and melting in a 1/8-in.-i.d. nickel tube. Nitrogen was
used initially for agitation and then as a blanket while the material
was kept at 600°C for varicus times. The tube was quickly quenched
with cold water at the end of the test to fix the NiFo concentration
at varicus heights in the tube. The tube was then cut into 1/2-in.-
long sections and the salt was aralyzed for nickel.

3.2 HNaf Decogbamination Step

 

3.2.1 Operation in e Temperature Range of 100-400°¢

The flowsheet (Fig. 2.1) for the volatility process provides
for volatilizing UFg from molten fluoride salt with fluorine,
shsorbing the UFg on NaF at 100°C, then desorbing with fluorine
at 100-400°C and passing the desorbed UF§ through a second NaF
bed to the final cold trep. In the case of long-decayed uranium
reactor fuel, most of the volaiile activity in the UFg stream
from the molten salt step is due to ruthenium and nicbium, both
of which form volatile pentafluorides. Laboratory tests have
demonstrated that ruthenium is not sbsorbed very much on NaF at
100°C, tat effectively passes tl rough the first Nal bed with the
excess fluorine used in the molten salt step. Nioblum, on the
other hand, is absorbed on the NaF with the UFg. This sbsorption
is predominantly irreversible since the nicblum remains for the
most part with the NaF during U¥g desorption. Use of the second
NaF bed appears essential to prevent cross contamination and to
achleve effective decontamination of the UFg (particularly from
any ruthenium revolatilized from the end of the first bed) in
processing consecutive batches. Much of the ruthenium remelning
in the first NaF bed is "plated out” over all of the metal surface;
including that near the cutlet. This problem has also been
encountered in Alstillation work.” The effective absorpbion of
rutheniun sctivity on NaF at high temperatures (see Sec. 3.2.2) is
perhaps partly responsible for the efficiency of the second bed.

in six tests of the double-bed procedure (using 20-40 g uranium),
the activity of the product Ufg was less than the ULy-UXp activity
normal in neturel uranium. Four of the tests were made comsecutively
with the same 60-ml Nal beds end showed that the decontemination
effectiveness of the system does not decrease with use (Table 3.6).
The over-all beta- or garma-decontanination factor in each of the
six runs was no less than 102, with 102 being attributable to the
fused salb-fiuvorination step and 103 to the absorption-desorption
process. The low product activity nade calculation of specific
decontamination factors impracticel. The effectiveness of the
double bed system was shown in the six tests by the distribution of
the volatilized activity (Teble 3.7).

An over-all beta- or gamma-decontamlination factor of greater
than 10% was obtained by the sbsorption-desorption procedure using
200 ml HaF in a single bed (Table 3.8). Calculation of specific
decontamination factors was possible because the product UFg was
radioactive in excess of the Ud;-Uip level. The typlesl behavior of
the ruthenlum and niobium activities was also observed in this run.

The uranium retention on the two Naf beds in the four-run
series was respectively 0.5 and 5.1% (Table 3.6), This excessive
loss was due to some back-pressure buildup, which was evident in
all runs; as the result of either partial plugging of the NaF beds
or a stoppage in the UFg cold trap. It is essential to avoid any
prolonged restriction of the gas flow, which would result in a
major part of the UFg remaining in the bed as it approaches 400°C
(see discussion of decomposition effect, Sec. 4.3). For example,
three successive complete cycles with UFg in a two-bed NaF sytem,
where little plugging occurred, resulted in retentions of 0.04 and
0.01%, respectively, in the two beds. In a single-cycle test with
the same equipment, the uranium retentions were 0.05 and 0.01%
respectively. The per cent of loss, therefore, does not appear to
depend on the mmber of cycles,

3.2.2 Operation at a Temperature Above 600°C

Fair decontamination was obtained with NaF in either a 9- or
an 18-in.~long bed at 650°C when the NeF/U welght ratio was 3/1
(Table 3.9, Runs 1, 2, 3) or 6/1 (Table 3.10, Runs 1 and 3). When
the 9-in.-long bed was re-used (Table 3.9, Runs 3 and 4), so that
the over-all NaF/U weight ratio was 1.5/1 for both runs, decontami-
nation factors for gross beta, gross gamua, and ruthenium deta
decreased sharply. With the 18-in.-long bed the same effect was
observed, although here the over-all WaF/U welght ratio for the
two runs was 3/1 (Table 3.10, Runs 1-2 and 3-4). The imperfect
decontamination of the UFg in any single run and the ruthenium
absorbed in one run leads to cross-contamination over consecutive
runs (illustrated by sharp decrease in ruthenium gamma~decontami-
nation factors in subsequent runs). However, the high effectiveness
of NaF in removing ruthenium at > 600°C was in contrast to the much
smaller hee observed in a UFg absorption cycle at 100°C (see
Sec. 3.2.1

Use of NaF at 600-650°C was disconbimued because of the excessive
corrosion, the difficulty with which the temperature was maintained,
and the great variation of uranium retention on the bed. The best
results were secured with a high flow rate for the UFg-Fp gas stream
from the molten salt step. When the flow rate was decreased in order
to secure more decontamination, the uranium retention became very
high (see Sec. 4.3). Actual sintering of the NaF bed usually occurred
at high uranium retentions, thus accounting for some of the excessive
corrosion.

4,0 BASIC CHEMICAL STUDIES

4.1 NaF Capacity for UFg

The absorption capacity of NaF for UFg was about 0.9 g of
uranium per gram of salt for one lot of Harshsw Chemical Company
material under a variety of conditions (Table 4.1). The capacity
of Beker and Adamson Company reagent-grade NaF was 1.89 g of
uranium per gram of salt. Absorption of UFg on Naf under an
initial vecuum indicated a capacity range of 0.80 to 0.90 for
different mesh sizes, while absorption values obtained when the
excess UFg was removed with fluorine as a sweep gas varied from
0.72 to 0.86. Practically the same capacity values were obtained
at 70, 100, and 150°C and at two different pressures. The capacity
of 0.9 for the Harshaw Chemical Company material is independent of
the particle size to which it is degraded. The 1.89 value for the
capacity of the Baker and Adamson Company material corresponds
closely to the molecular ratio in the complex UFg+3Nal. A complex
of this nature has been reported by other investigators.

As indicated, the original 1/8-in. pellets (Harshaw Chemical
Company) had practically the same capacity as the seme material
degraded to 12-40 mesh. Examination showed that the lemon-yellow
color, characteristic of the complex, was uniform inside the
pellet. Although the material was therefore fairly porous, the
limited capacity of spproximately 47% of theoretical and a surface
ares of only about 1 mc per gram indicated that the crystallite
size was sbout 103 angstroms. Severe conditioning of the NaF,
such as heating to 100-400°C with either vacuum or an atmosphere
of fluorine to eliminate HF or moisture, did not affect the
capacity measurements. Welght~loss tests after prolonged heating
showed that the HF or moisture content was no more than 0.05%,

L.2 Pressure of UF Above UFg-3NaF Complex

 

Vapor-pressure data for the UFg-NaF complex were obtained by
the transpiration method over the temperature range 80 to 320°C
(see Fig, h.1). The reaction involved is described by the equation
UFg*3NaF(s) —> UFg(g) + 3WaF(s). (1)

The data are fitted with the analytical expression

where T is the absolute temperature, Use of the Clausius~Clapeyron
formula with this equation gave a value of +23.2 kcal per mole of
UFg for the enthalpy change of Eq. 1.

The date were obtained by passing nitrogen at a flow rate of
100 ml/min, or less, through a prepared bed of the UFg-Na¥ complex
at any desired temperature, trapping out the UFg in the nitrogen
stream in a dilute A1(NO3)3 solution, and measuring the total
volume of nitrogen with a wet-test meter. The UFg hydrolysis
samples were analyzed by colorimetric or fluorimetric methods to
an accuracy of better than +5%. Temperature control of the bed
wes maintained always to within +0.2°C. The UFg-NaF complex was
prepared by saturating a 30-g bed of 12-20 mesh Harshaw Nal’ in a
1-in.-dia vertical nickel reactor with UFg at 100°C. Over 90% of
bed saturation was maintained throughout the tests. Check runs,
made at various No flow rates, showed no flow-rate effect.

Crude adiabatic experiments were made with 100-ml batches of
NaF to show that the reaction heat of 23.2 kcal per mole of UFg
produces a large temperature rise, approximately 130°C, if total
saturation with UFg (preheated to about 100°C) is carried out
quickly in a period of a few minutes.

4.3 Decomposition of UFg-3NaF Complex

 

A study of the decomposition of the UFg-3NaF complex at temper-
atures of 245°C and higher has confirmed the belief that uranium
retention on the NaF bed will be excessive in the NaF desorption
step if the temperature and sweep-gas flow rate are not properly
controlled. The retention results from decomposition of the UF» 3NaF
complex to a complex of NaF with UF5, which is not volatile.” A
maximum decomposition rate of about 0,01, 0.09, and 0.5% per minute
is incurred at 250, 300, and 350°C, respectively, in the absence of
fluorine if all the uranium is assumed to be in the form of the
solid complex UFge<3NaF. Under optimum conditions, UFg desorption
from the NaF bed (see Secs. 3.1.1 and 4,2) competes favorably with
the decomposition effect, resulting in a small uranium loss.

Fluorine appears essential to inhibit the decomposition reaction,
and possibly to promote refluorination of the nonvolatile U(V) com-
pound, formed in the decomposition. The possibility of any uranium
retention by the decomposition mechanism in the absorption step at
100°C appears to be insignificant, even over extended periods.

The temperature-dependence of the rate of decomposition of
UFge3Nal was determined in a series of runs over the temperature
-30-

range 245-355°C (Fig. 4.2). The probable reaction involved is
UFge3NaF (solid) ——» UFg-xNaF (solid) + 0.5Fp (gas).
The dependence of decomposition rate on temperature is
log r = 6.09 - 5.22 x 103/T

vhere r is the fractional decomposition rate in reciprocal minutes

and T is the absolute temperature. The rate was calculated on the
basis of an absorption capacity of 1.33 g of UFg per gram of NaF.

The energy of activation was calculated as +23.9 kcal/mole of UFg-3NaF
complex. It is possibly significant that this energy change is
approximately the same as the enthalpy change of +23.2 kcal per mole
involved in the volatilization of UF from the UFg-3NaF complex.

The decomposition data were obtained with 4- to 5-g samples of
NaF (Harshaw Chemical Company pellets classified to 12-20 mesh) held
in a U tube (1/2-in.-dia stainless steel tubing), through which
gaseous UFg was passed at atmospheric pressure. An oll bath was
used Tor manually controlling the temperature to +30C during the
course of each experiment. The runs were ended by removing the
oil bath and rapidly cooling the sample. The UFge3Na¥ was formed
at the beginning by saturating the NaF at a high UFg Tlow rate,
after which the flow rate was decreased to 0.1-1 g/min for the
remaining time. The length of the runs at various temperatures
was adjusted so as to obtain a U(V) content in the final product
of 1 to 10%. The excess UFg still absorbed on the NaF at the end
of each test was not desorbed because of the difficulty of achieving
this without increasing the uv) content. The amount of UFge3NaF
complex affected by the reaction was determined from U(V) and U(VI)
analyses. A temperature above 355°C was not used since it would be
difficult to maintain saturation of the NaF with UFg without use of
a pressurized system.

In preliminary work on the decomposition reaction, a U(V)
content of 20-26% represented a limit which could not be exceeded
in one cycle of saturation of the NaF with UFg at 100°C followed
by heating as a closed system to 350-400°C. Generally, in these
runs, the NaF weight increase verified the assumption that the
decomposition product is a complex of UFs with NaF, X-ray crystal-
lography data indicated that the UF's» oF complex in the decomposi-
tion product has an orthorhombic structure with cell dimensions
ap = 4.90 &, bg = 5.47 &, eg = 3.87 A. The x-ray pattern of 7~-
or p-UF 5 was not observed in the material.

5.0 RECOMMENDATIONS

Both the fused salt~-fluorination and NeF-absorption steps of
the volatility process require further research and development.
The presented laboratory studies have demonstrated the chemical
feasibility of the process. Much further work will be needed,
however, in sdapting the process for use at the pilot-plant level.
Chemical-engineering requirements will doubtless be a major factor
in future modification of the process for use with various types
of reactor fuel. Continued research is also essentisl to securing
8 better understanding of the basic chemistry involved in the twe
steps of the volatility process.

Tn the NaF absorption step, there is particular need of research
on the behavior of NaF with various volatile fission-product fluorides.
It seems quite likely, for example, that NaF has a high capaclty with
respect to the fluorides of zirconium snd niobium due to the formation
of definite chemical complexes. This would make renewal of the NaF
beds possibly more economical than regeneration. On the other hand,
the volatile fluorides of other fission products, such as Mo, Te,
and T, may behave similarly to RuFg which apparently does not form
a complex except at much higher temperatures.

The NaF method of decontaminating UFg from fission-product
activity is potentially useful in many diverse forms. Although
the decontamination factor of 10° (for the entire process) probably
dces not represent the top limit obtainable, use of a third bed
should be considered if the double-bed system does not give the
decontamination necessary with high-burn-up reactor fusls. It
seems quite possible also that the multiple-bed system could be
replaced with a single bed, either moving or fixed, used in con-
Junction with a thermal gradient. Much development work on the
optimum physical structure of the NaF is needed. A suggested
modification is the use of NaF structurally supported in some
manner, either with metal (Ni) or a diluent material such as
CaF or AlF3.
