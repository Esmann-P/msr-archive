MSRE SYSTEMS AND COMPONENTS PERFORMANCE

ABSTRACT

When the MSRE was shut down in December 1969, it had accumulated
13,172 full-pover hours of operation. Salt had been circulated in the
fuel system for 21,788 hours and in the coolant system for 26,076 hours.

Essentially no difficulty was encountered with the primary system
during operation. After the reactor was shut down there was an indication
of a leak in the drain-tank piping at/or near a freeze valve. Further in-
vestigation will be made later as to the nature and cause of this leak.

There was a small continuous leakage of lubricating oil into the fuel

pump throughout the operation. This, together with salt mist, caused peri-
odic plugging in the off-gas system which was designed for clean helium.
Filters installed in the main lines proved very effective. :

In early operation, difficulty was encountered with the coolant. radi-
ator. The doors would not seal, there were too many air leaks, and thermal

insulation was inadequate. After these were repaired, the system operated

fine except for a failure of one of the main blowers and some trouble with

the blower bearings.
Only relatively minor difficulties were encountered with the contain-

ment and other systems.

 
 

 

 

1. INTRODUCTION.
P. N. Haubenreich

Operation of the MSRE constituted a major step toward the objectives
of the Molten-Salt Reactor Program. The goal of this program is the de-
velopment of large, fluid-fuel reactors having good neutron economy and
producing low-cost electricity.? The MSRE was built to demonstrate the
practicality of the molten-salt reactor concept, with emphasis on the
compatibility of the materials (fluoride salts, graphite, ‘and container
alloy), the performance of key components, and the relisbility and main-
tainebility of the plant.

In the course of 5 years of testing and operation of the MSRE (1964 -
1969) the operators sccumulated considerable experience with the various
components and systems in the reactor plant. This experience, properly
disseminated, should be valuable in the continuing development of molten-
salt reactors. Much has already been published in the Molten Salt Reactor
Program semiannual progress reports (Refs. 2 to 1k) but such reporting is
piecemeal and sometimes rather condensed. On the other hand, there is
much very detailed information in test reports and operations and mainte-
- nance files, but these are relatively inaccessible and specific informa-
tion is tedious to extract. It was considered worthwhile, therefore, to
extract, organize, evaluate end report the experience with MSRE systems
and components. CL - |

The purpose of this report is to present a , convenient, comprehensive
description of the MSRE experience. The first chapters briefly describe

the plant and outline the chronology of its operation. Next there is a
chapter on the overall plant performance, including statistics relative
to relisbility end maintainebility. The chapters which follow are each
devoted to one system or component. Finally, there is a chapter of dis-

cussion and conclusions.
 

 

2. DESCRIPTION OF THE PLANT

R. H. Guymon

The MSRE was a single-region, circulating molten-salt fueled, thermal
reactor which produced heat at the rate of about 8 Mw. The fuel was UF
in a carrier salt of LiF-BeF,-ZrF,. At the operating temperature of 1200°F,
this salt is a liquid which has very good physical properties: viccosity
about 8 centipoise, density sbout 135 1b/ft3, and vapor pressure less than
0.1 mn Hg. | | |

The design conditions are shown in the flow diagram (Fig. 2-1). The

general arrangement of the plant is shown in Fig. 2-2. The salt-containing
- piping and equipment was made of Hastelloy-N, a nickel-molybdenun-iron-
‘chromium alloy with exceptional resistance to corrosion by molten fluorides
and with high strength at high temperature. |

In the reactor primary system, the fuel salt was recirculated by the
sump-type centrifugal pump through the shell-and-tube heat exchanger and
the reactor vessel. The 5-ft diem. by 8-ft high reactor vessel is shown
in Figure 2-3. It was filled with 2-in. by 2-in. graphite moderator stringers
which had grooves machined in the sides to form flow channels for the fuel
salt. Since the graphite is compatible with the molten salt, it was possible
to use unclad graphite which is desirable to obtain good neutron economy.
The heat generated in the fuel salt as it passed through the reactor was
transferred in the heat exchanger to a molten LiF-BeF; coolant salt. The

“coolant salt was circulated by means of a second sump-type pump through

 

the heat exchanger and through the radiator. Air was blown by two axial

flow blowers past the radiator tubes to remove the heat which was sent

up the coolant stack where it was dissipated to the atmosphere. |
Drain tanks were provided for storing the fuel and coolant salts at

high temperature when the reactor was not opersating.. LiF-BeF, flush salt

used for flushing the fuel system before end after maintenance was stored Of

in the fuel flush tank. The salts were drained by gravity. They were

transferred back to the circulating systems by pressurizing the tanks with

helium.

Details of the MSRE Core and Reactor Vessel
The fission product gases, krypton and xenon, were removed continuously
from the circulating fuel salt by spraying salt at a rate of 50 gpm into
the cover gas above the liquid in the fuel pump tank. There they trans-
ferred from the liquid to the gas phase and were swept out of the tank by
a small purge of helium. After a delay of about 1-1/2 hr in the piping,
this gas passed through water-cooled beds of activated charcoal. The
krypton and xenon were delayed until all but the 8%Kr decayed and then
were diluted with air and discharged to the atmosphere.

The fuel and coolant systems were provided with equipment for taking
samples of the molten salt while the reactor was operating at power. The
fuel sampler was also used for adding small amounts of fuel to the reactor
while at power to compensate for burnup.

The negative temperature coefficient of reactivity of the fuel and
graphite moderator made nuclear control of the system very simple. However,
three control rods were provided for adjusting temperature, compensating
for buildup of fission products, and for shutdown.

The plant was provided with a simple processing facility for treating
full 75-13 batches of fuel salt with hydrogen fluoride or fluorine gases.
The hydrogen fluoride treatment was for removing oxide contamination from
the salt as Hy0. The fluorine treatment utilized the fluoride volatility
process for removing the uranium as UFg.

Auxiliary systems included: (1) a cover-gas system with treating
stations for removing oxygen and moisture from the helium cover gas;

(2) two closed-loop oil systems for cooling the fuel and: coolant pumps

and providing lubrication to'the bearings; (3) = closed loop component
coolant system for cooling the control rods and other in-cell components;
(4) several cooling water systems including a closed-loop treated water
system for cooling certain in-cell equipment; (5) a ventilation system for
contamination control; and (6) an instrument air system.

All of the primary salt system was located in the reactor and drain
tank cells. These sealed pressure vessels provided secondary containment.

3. CHRONOLOGY OF OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE ”
’ . R. H. Guymon

Design of the MSRE began in the summer of 1960 and by August 196L,
installation was far enough along to permit the planned non-nuclear
testing!® to begin. Milestones that were passed in the years which fol-
lowed are listed in Table 3-1.

Table 3-1. Milestones in MSRE Operation

 

Salt first loaded into tanks October 2k, 196k
Salt first circulated through core January 12, 1965
First criticality (235u) June 1, 1965
First operation in megawatt range January 24, 1966
Full power reached May 23, 1966
Nuclear operation with 2357 concluded March 26, 1968
Strip uranium from fuel salt August 23-29, 1968
First critical with 2%3U October 2, 1968
Reach full power with 233U January 28, 1969
Nuclear operation concluded December 12, 1969

 

The activities during the period of non-nuclear testing, zZero-power
experiments, and preparation for power operation are outlined in Fig. 3-1.
During the prenuclear testing, except for the usual startup troubles
due to early failures and instrument malfunctions, all systems operated
well and there were no unanticipated problems in handling the molten
salt. Some plugging of the offgas system valves and filters was encoun-
~ tered, but this did not seen serious. oo
Criticality was attained by adding UFy-LiF enriching salt to the
--carrier salt. More uranium was added to bring the fuel gradually to the
desired operating concentration while the control rods were calibrated and
reactivity coefficients were measured. At the conclusion of the ‘zero-
power nuclear experiments the reactor was shut down to finish construction

of the vapor-condensing system, to carry out some inspection, and to

meke some repairs and modifications, including replacement of the heat-
warped radiator doors. The first test of the secondary containment was
made during this shutdown period.

After tests in the kilowatt range showed that the dynamics of the
system were as expected, the approach to full power was started in
January 1966. Plugging in the fuel offges system occurred immediately
efter increasing the power to one megawatt. Almost three months were
spent investigating and remedying the offgas problem by installation of
a large, efficient filter. As shown in Fig. 3-2, the power ascension was
resumed in April and full power, which was limited by the capability of
the heat-removal system, was attained in May.

High-power operation was gbruptly halted in July when the hub and
blades of one of the main blowers.in the heat-removal system broke up.
While the reactor was down, ‘the arrey of graphite and metal specimens was
removed from the core end & new array instelled. During the flushing
operetions before the specimen: removal, the fuel-pump bowl was accidentally
over-filled and some flush salt froze in the attached gas lines. Tempo-
rary heeters were installed remotely to clear the lines and in November
the offgas line at the pump bowl was cleared by running a tool through it.

Most of the remaining operation with 235) was at power. Restrictions
continued to develop in the offges system but caused little delay in the
program. Shutdowns were necessary to make repairs on the fuel sampler-
enricher, the component coolant pumps, and in-cell air line disconnects
~ whose leakage caused en indication of high cell leak rate. The core

. specimens were replaced periodically, annual containment tests were made,

 

end verious experiments conducted. Operation with 2357 fuel was termi-
‘nated on March 26, 1968. so that the urenium could be stripped from the
fuel salt end replaced with 233y

During the shutdown, which followed, the core specimens were replaced,
and the fuel piping and vessels were surveyed using remote gamma rey spec-
troscopy to determine the distribution of fission products. Necessary and
preventive maintenance was also done in preparation for operation with
© 233) fuel.
After testing and extensive modification of the excess fluorine dis-

posal system, the flush salt and fuel salt were processed to strip the

Loading of 233y into the carrier salt through special equipment

closed and lesk-tested before the reactor was made critical by small ad-
ditions of 233%y through the sampler-enricher. On October 8, 1968, Gienn
Seaborg’ manipulated the controls to raise the power to 100 Tw, meking
the MSRE the world's first reactor to’ operate .o n 233y, Co

Early in the zero-power physics experiments, the amount of gas en-
trained in the circulating fuel had increased frém <0.1 to ~ 0.5 vol %.
Investigation of this, as well as difficulties with the sampler-enricher
and plugging in the offgas system, delayed the approach to full pover
until Jenuary 1969.

As the power was increased into the megawatt range, “there were ob-
served for the first time sporadic small increases (~ 5 to 10%) in nuclear
power for a few seconds, occurring with a varying frequency somewhere
around 10/hr. The characteristics of the transients pointed to changes
in gas volume in the fuel loop and it appeared that they were ‘most likely
caused by occasional release of some gas that collected in the core.
This hypothesis was -supported when, late in February, a variable - -frequency
generator was used to operate the fuel pump at reduced speed. The gas
entrainment in the fuel circulating loop decreased sharply (from 0.7 to
<0.1 vol %)-and the perturbations ceased entirely.!®

Operations continued at various nuclear powers and. fuel-pump speeds
until June 1 when the reactor was shut down to replace the core specimens,
investigate the distribution of fission products in the primary loop by
gamma scanning, remove the offgas restrictions, and test the secondary
conteinment., For the first time one of the control rods did not scram
a and it was replaced during the shutdown. Co
The. remaining months of operation were spent in various studies. of
the behavior of tritium, xenon, and certein other fission products in the
“reactor. .In November, it became evident that sufficient funds would not
be available to continue operation, and on December 12, 1969 nuclear *
operation was concluded. Another first occurred shortly after the fuel

was drained when a small amount of fission-product activity appeared in

 
 

 

14

the cell atmosphere, indicating a leak in the primary system apparently
near a freeze valve.

After the final shutdown, the facility was placed in a standby con-
dition to await post-operation examinations plenned for early in the next
fiscal year.!® The operating crews were disbanded and over the next six
~ months most of the engineers were reassigned as they completed analyses
and reporting of the reactor experience. As of this writing, the post-
operation examination has not been accomplished.

~ In this report and elsewhere MSRE run numbers are often used to
identify the period of operation. Generally a new run number was assigned
at the end of a major shutdown or when there were substantial changes in
.the purpose or type of operation. The starting dates for each of the 20

runs are listed in Table 3-2.

L, PLANT PERFORMANCE AND.STATISTICS
R. H. Guymon P. N. Haubenreich

"They 've kept the darned thing running and when they
shut down they can get back on the line; you can't
knock that!" An unidentified "AEC spokesman', .as
quoted in October 12, 1967 Nucleonics Week.

"So far the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment has operated
successfully and has earned a reputation for relia-
bility." USAEC Chairman Glenn T. Seaborg at the
“ceremony marking the first operation of a reactor
fueled with 233y, October 8, 1968.

The MSRE ran long and it ran well. It ran long enough with 235y .

fuel to attain the original goals of the experiment, then continued

through more than a year of added experiments with 233y fuel. These
statements are supported by the statistics on the overall plant perform-
ance presented in this chapter. Later chapters describe the performance

of individual components and systems which made up the plant.

4.1 Cumulative Statistics

Several different indications of how long the MSRE ren are presented

in Table 4-1. The time critical is a commonly used index for reactor ex-

periments. Another basis of comparison with other resctors is the number

of equivalent full-power hours. Integrated power (Mw-hrs) is closely re-
lated. (The figures quoted here are based on a full power of 8.0 Mw,

~ which is the value indicated by heat balances.20 Analyses of isotopic

changes !Y indicate that full paver was T.34 Mw, in which case the tabu-
lated Mw-hrs should be multiplied by 0.92. J). ‘The amounts of time that’

salt circulated in the loops are of interest from the standpoint ‘of the
demonstration of materials compatibility... Each pump operated a length of

“time equal to the salt circulation plus helium circulation in that loop.

The number of thermal cycles of various kinds on different parts of
the salt system are listed in Table 4-2, The numbers are small in com-

parison with the permissible numbers of cycles except in the case of the

freeze flanges. Here the fuel flanges experienced 99% of the permissible
number of cycles based on early celculetions or 23% of the number permissi-
blé on the basis of extended tests of a prototype flange.

In order to put the MSRE record in proper perspective, it is neces-
sary to measure it against those of other reactors in a similar stage of
development. A comparison on the basis of equivalent full-power hours is
made in Table 4-3. It is not invidious to say that the MSRE compares well
with other reactors having the same purpose; that is, to demonstrate the

practicality of a reactor concept.
h.2 frat lebility during Various Periods

The best index of the reliability of a plant should be the fraction
of time (over some extended period) that it is availeble for its intended
service. Perhaps inevitably, however, in experimental plants where the
objectives include. more then simply generating power, the definition of
availability is not J —— so clearcut. Therefore we have presented in
Table 4-4 an index which, in principle, is less significant but whose’
definition is quite clear; namely, the time that the reactor was actually
critical in each 3-month period during the 4 years of power operation.
Percentages of elapsed time are shown for selected intervals, but these
must not be regarded as & measure of reliability since the reactor was
subcritical much of the time because the planned program required it.
~ (During shutdowns for core specimen removal or the substitution of
233. for example.)

"In the MSRE test program’ ® it was planned that there be a period of
} operation for the primary purpose of demonstrating plant reliability.
This phase of the program covered the last 15 months of operation with
2353. Table 4-5 gives a breakdown of the time during this period. The
reactor was critical 80% of the time and the availability of the plant,
as defined in this table, was 86%. This amply justified Dr. Sesborg's
statement quoted at the head of this chapter. | }

Another indication of reliability is how long a plant can be kept
continuously on line. In the final run with 235y, the fuel salt was in

the loop continuously for just over 6 months, before it was draimed for

the planned processing. During these 188 days the reactor was counted as

unavailable only 63 h (1.4% of the time) while repairs were being made to
the fuel-sampler drive. It was actually critical for 97.8% of the time.

The final phase of the MSRE operation, with 233y fuel, was not aimed
primarily at demonstrating relisbility,?! but it turned out that the availa-
bility of the plant was still remarkably high. This is shown in Table 4-6.
Here available time includes (in addition to the critical time) suberiti-
cal intervals during the zero-power experiments, time spent in changing
the pump power supply during variable-speed tests, changing the core speci-
mens, gamma-scanning the drained salt systems, and experiments on behavior
of gas in flush salt.

4.3 Interruptions of Operations

Figure 4-1 provides a broad view of the MSRE operation and major inter-
ruptions. This figure was prepared for inclusion (together with similar
graphs from many other reactors) in the USAEC's annual presentation to the

JCAE and, according to the rules, assigns a brief, descriptive reason for

~ each shutdown of 5 days or more. - A great deal more detail as to the nature

and cause of these and shorter interruptions in operation is given in the
} figures and 11 tebles which follow.

Figure 4-2 covers 1966, the first year of power operation. It shows
when salt was in the fuel loop, when the reactor was at power, and assigns
& number to each interruption in either. A number in a circle means the
interruption was due to some experiment. A number in a square means that
the interruption was necessary because of trouble with some system or com-
ponent. Figures 4-3, h-4, and 4-5 display the same kind of information
for 1967, 1968, and 1969 respectively.

In Tables 4-7 through 4-10, the interruptions in operation during
each year are categorized as to the type of interruption, the cause, and
other work that was accomplished during the interruption. Each interrup-
tion listed in these four tables is described more fully in Tables 4-11
through 4-1k.

The next three tables summarize the foregoing mass of information on
interruptions. Table 4-15 is a summary by type; Table 4-16, by cause and
work done during the interruption. Because unscheduled scrams of the con-
trol rods are of special interest, a separate breakdown of these is given
in Teble 4-17. It should be noted that never were the rods scrammed because
of the reactor power, the reactor period, or the fuel temperature going out

of limits.
4.4 Time Required for Operational Tasks

One aspect of the operability of a plant (and one which affects plant
availability) is how long it takes to do various tasks required in the opera-
tion. The purpose of this section is to summarize the MSRE experience in
this regard.

Manpower and the approximate number of working hours required for
various tasks are listed in Table 4-18. One must recognize that some of
these figures are subject to considerable variation. The time required to
do a particular task depended on chance difficulties that were encountered,
the experience of the crew, other jobs being done concurrently and the
urgency of speedily completing the task, i. e., whether or not it was given
a high priority. Furthermore, sometimes extra requirements such as special
data-teking caused the Job to take longer than usual. The figures in Table
4-18 apply to fairly normal situations; not the best nor the worst. Very
brief descriptions of the tasks are given below, with references to the

section of the MSRE Operating Procedures?? followed in each case, if applicable.
4.4.1 Auxiliary Systems Startup Check Lists

During a shutdown, much of the equipment remained in operation. However,
after long shutdowns, the auxiliary systems startup check lists (Section U4)
were completed to assure that nothing had been overlooked. All valves and
switches were checked, equipment was put into operation and standby equipment
was tested. These were done as late in the shutdown as practical.

LA — Electrical Startup Check List assured that all main breakers were
closed so that equipment and heaters could be started from the control
boards. |

4B — Instrument Air System Startup Check List assured that the com-
pressors and driers were operating properly, that the standby compressor
would automatically start if needed, and that emergency nitrogen cylinders
were installed. :

LUC — Water System Startup Check List assured that all pumps and tower
fans were operable and that proper water flow was established on all |
equipment. oo

4D — Component Cooling Systems Startup Check List assured that all
valving was set properly and that all blowers were operable. .

UE — Shield end Containment Startup Check List is divided into
5 parts. Part (1) checked that the primary and secondary block and check
valves, containment enclosures, and lines were leak-tight to assure ade-
quate containment. Removable shielding was also checked to assure that it
had been reinstalled. This check list was assigned to an operating engi-
neer on day shift with technician and pipefitter help as needed.

Part (2) — this is the time required to pressurize the cells to 20 psig
by adding instrument air. Part (3) involved teking pressure and tempera-
ture data periodically to establish the cell leak rate. Some containment
valves and lines were checked while at pressure. The time required for
checking these is included in Part (1). Part (4) is the time required to
vent the cells, evacuate to -2 psig, and purge with nitrogen. Part (5)
also involved taking periodic data. Since there was -a small water leak in
the cell, it took about T days for the atmosphere to reach equilibrium.

LF — Ventilation System Startup Check List assured that a stack fan
was in operation, that the other one would automatically start, and that
ventilation was adequate in. all areas.

LUG — Leak Detector Systems Startup Check List assured that all valves
were open to leak-detected flanges and that the overall lesk-rate was
satisfactory. }

LH — Instrumentation Startup Check List assured that each instrument
and circuit functioned properly. Abnormal conditions were simulated and
where possible the control action was allowed to occur. One operating
engineer on dey shift was assigned responsibility for completing this
check list with technician and instrument mechanic assistance as required.

Some of the tests were done on shift.

4.4.2 Reactor Startup
The manipulations involved in actual startup of the reactor

(Section 5) are described below.
5A — Purging Oxygen and Moisture from the Fuel Circulating System in-
volved setting the helium purge at maximum rate and operating the fuel
pump to circulate it. The time of purge was a calculated number.

5B — Startup of Cover Gas and Offgas System involved setting the
valves end checking the helium treating station.
‘SE — Start of Lube 0il Systems involved checking the supply tank,
draining the oil catch tank, setting valves and checking that the standby
pumps would start automatically.

~~ SF — Heatup of Fuel and Coolent Systems involved raising the heater

settings and maintaining a reasonsble temperature distribution. The fuel
. and coolant systems could be heated simultaneously. The time given is
for heating the coolant system from room temperature and the reactor sys-
tem from L4OO°F (normal shutdown condition) to 1200°F and reaching
equilibrium.

5H — Routine Pressure Test involved raising the fuel system pressure
to 60 psig (usually with flush salt circulating), then lowering the fuel
system pressure and increasing the coolant system pressure to 60 psig.
All pressure switches and their control or alarm actions were checked.

5I — Filling the Fuel and Coolant Systems is divided into 4 parts.
Part (1) involved thawing the freeze valves, filling the coolant loop,
checking thaw times of the freeze valves, refilling and starting the
coolant pump. Part (2) involved thawing the freeze valve, filling the
fuel loop with flush salt and starting the fuel pump. - Part (3) involved
-dreining the flush salt, emptying the overflow tank and freezing the
freeze valve. Part’ (4h) involved thawing the freeze valve, adjusting tem-
peratures, running rod drop times and various other safety checks and
teking base line countrate data. Part (5) involved filling the fuel
loop with fuel salt, stopping at six levels to teke count rate data,
freezing the drain freeze valve and starting the fuel pump.

5d — Criticality and Power Operation is divided into 2 parts.
Part (1) involved running rod drop and other tests. The time does not
 

 

 

© 57

include check lists 8A, 8B, or 8D which sometimes had to be done before
criticality (see 4.4.3). Part (2) involved menipulating the rods ‘and

heat-removal system components to reach full power.

h.4.3 Operation

Various jobs were done while the resactor was operating. These are
described below. N

6A3 or 6A4 — Fuel System Sampling or Addition of Enriching Capsules
involved a series of manipulations to insert and withdraw a capsule while
maintaining containment. Two samples could be delivered to the laboratory
per shift if no difficulties were encountered. This rate could not be
sustained due to decontamination of carriers, etc.

6B — Coolant Salt Sampling involved a less complicated series of
manipulations to insert and withdraw a sample from the coolant pump.

8 — Periodic Instrument Checks involved testing as much of the

 

critical equipment as possible without interrupting operation of the
reactor. | |
91 — Emptying the Overflow Tank involved pressurizing it with helium
and venting when it was nearly empty. This took about twice as long when
the FP offgas line was plugged.
12A — Control Room and Building Logs were taken twice per shift.
Some adjustments were usually required, water treatment was added and

other odd Jobs were done as part of the logs.
L.4.4 Shutdown of the Reactor

This (Section 10) is described below. - It is divided into 4 parts.
Part (1) involved reducing ‘the power. This could be done. by scramming
the rods and the load or by inserting the rods and lowering the radiator
doors. Part (2) involved draining the fuel system and freezing the freeze
velves. Part (3) involved draining the coolant system and freezing the
freeze valves. Part (lL) involved cooling the systems to 400°F.

4.4.5 Recovery from Unplanned Shutdowns

A number of times during operation, power outages and other unex-
pected events caused shutdowns. Often there was a desire to return to

operation as soon as possible. Some of these are described below.

9A-1 — Restart Equipment After a Power Outage involved starting the
diesels, restarting equipment and resetting tripped instruments. Co

5J-1 — Return to Power After a Load and Rod Scram involved manipu-
lating the rods and heat-removal system components to return to power. If
no instrument or equipment tests were necessary, this could be done in
less than an hour. |

11A, 5I, and 5J — Return to Power After a Drain is divided into
3 parts. Part (1) assumes a drain to both drain tanks followed by a
transfer through the transfer lines, refill and return to power (this is
the design method of transfer). Part (2) assumes a drain to both drain
tanks followed by a transfer through the fill lines, refill, and return to
power. (This method of transfer was used to save time. Jumpering of
interlocks was necessary.) Part (3) assumes a drain to only one drain

tank followed by a fill and return to power.
4.4.6 Reactor Startup After a Major Shutdown

Each startup was different, requiring scheduling between the com-
pletion of meintenance and start of operation. The cell membrane was
usually installed shortly after the final closure of the primary system.
Assuming this, and that maintenance on out-of-cell components was com-
pleted by the time they were needed, a somewhat. typical startup would be

as shown in Fig. 4-6.
4.5 Changes Meade in the Plant

The number and kinds of changes made in a plant after it begins
operation are influenced by two different things: original design and
changing activities. In some single-purpose systems the number of changes
may simply reflect how well the original design met its goals, In an ex-
perimental plant such as the ‘MSRE, most of the changes may be required for
experimental purposes or changes in the mode of operation. In any event,
time spent in meking changes affects the availability of the plant.

During the course of the MSRE operation many changes were made, but

only a few caused significant delsy in the program.

 
 

 

60

After the end of construction and the non-nuclear checkout of the
MSRE, it was required that a change request be formally initiated, re-
viewed and approved before any modification was made. (Section 13B of -
Reference 22, which prescribes the procedure, defines a modi fication as
"a change in the physical plant which produces a significently different
characteristic or function in any component or system.") In the 55 months
from June 1965 through December 1969, a total of 633 requests for changes
in the reactor system were initiated, of which 512 were approved. For the
chemical processing plant, 113 change requests were initiated of which 87
‘were approved.

Teble 4-19 summarizes for each 6-month period the number of requests
initiated and approved for the reactor. The tgble also categorizes the
approved changes as to the reason for making the change and the type of
change that it was. As indicated, most of the changes were aimed at filling
the needs of normal operation and over half were changes in either instru-
mentation or setpoints.

Table 4-20 summarizes the change requests for the chemical processing
plant.

Although we know how many changes were made, we cannot accurately sum
up the times required for making the changes. We can say, however, that in
- the case of the reactor change requests, the vast majority either took
very little time to execute or were made while other work was going on.
Exceptions include the work on the fuel offgas system in the spring of
1966. In the-processing plant, the summer of 1968 was spent in testing
and modifications, particularly of the fluorine disposal system.

4.6 Tabulation of Recorded Variables at Full power

It seemed desirable to record a set of readings of all of the various

reactor variables at normal conditions. However, even though the MSRE ran

at full power much of the time, conditions were constantly changing due

mainly to the varlous- experiments which were performed. Also some of

the variables were not recorded regularly thus making it difficult to
select the best time. After consideration of these factors, the 12 to 8
shift on 10/12/69 was selected as a period at full power when conditions
were fairly normal and considerable information was available. Values
were taken from the various recorder charts, routine control room and
building logs and the weekly, monthly, and other check lists. These are
tabulated in Tables 4,21 and 4.22. A snapshot. listing all of the computer
inputs was also retrieved from the computer tapes for 0400 on 10/12/69.
These values are listed in Table 4.23. The location of the sensing element
is described briefly in the description column. The number and letters in
the identification column correspond to those used in the design drawings
and other design documents. They can be used to further identify the

variable.

5.1 ° Description

 

The fuel-circulating loop consisted of a graphite-moderated reactor,
‘a centrifugal type fuel pump with an overflow tank, and a shell-and-tube
heat exchanger, all connected by 5-inch Hastelloy-N piping. The normal
operating temperature was about 1200°F and fuel or flush salt was circulated
at 1200 gpm. When the reactor was not in operation, the salt was drained
to one or both of the fuel drain tenks or to the fuel flush tank. Inter-
connecting salt piping and freeze valves permit filling the reactor or
transferring salt between tanks by menipulating valves in the helium sup-
ply and vent lines. :

5.2 Purging Moisture and Oxygen from the System

_ In the fall of 1964, before salt was charged into the drain tanks,
oxygen and moisture were purged from the fuel circulating’ system and the
drain tanks. This was accomplished by pressurizing the system with helium

to assure that it was leak-tight followed by a combination of evacuation
and purging with dry helium before and during the heatup. Details of the
. heatup are.given in Chapter 17. The helium was introduced at the fuel

Co. pump vhich was in operation to provide circulation in: the 100p. The system

 

 

was vented or evacuated at the normal fuel pump offgas line (518) or at the
" salt transfer line (line 110) to the fuel processing system. The latter
provided a longer flow path and thus a more effective purge.

. Figure o-1 gives the sequence of operations used. Peaks of moisture
in the effluent gas were observed at sbout 250°F and again at about. 650°F.
The system was evacuated. after each’ of these moisture peeks. Further heat-
ing to 1130°F did not ceuse eny significant additional moisture releases.

Later analyses of salt samples indicated that the purging had been very
effective.

5.3 Fuel-Circulating-System Volume Calibration

After the flush salt had been added to the drain tanks and transfers
made to fill the freeze valves (see Section 5.11), the fuel circulating
system was filled and operated for 8 days. It was then drained and filled
several times to check the drain times and calibrate the system. The cali-
bration was done by increasing the drain tank pressure in increments and
recording the drain tank weight and the differential pressure between the
drain tank and the fuel pump. - This is plotted in Fig. 5-2. The system
was purposely overfilled to determine the position of the fuel-pump over-
flow line and to test the overflow-tank level indicators... Overflow oc-

curred at readings on the two fuel-pump bubblers of 89.5 and 91%. A total

of 105 1b of salt transferred to the overflow tank produced a reading on

the level instrument of 11.5% or 4.2 inches of salt, in acceptable agree-

ment with the calculated response.

5.4 Drain Times

The temperature distribution in the drain valve (FV-103) was con-
trolled so that it would thaw in. 9 to 11 minutes after an emergency drain
signal. (See Chapter 20.) The time required thereafter for the salt to
drain from the loop depended on which valves were open in the salt and gas
lines. Normally the freeze valves to both drain tanks were kept thawed,
but for a while after a salt £111 one valve would still be frozen. An

- emergency drain signal acted to thaw the freeze valves and to open valves

in drain tank vent lines and in the equalizer lines between the gas in the
fuel. pump and in the drain tanks, but it was considered possible that one
or more of these valves might not" open. Tests were conducted, therefore,
to measure drain. times for ‘various conceivable combinations. of valving.

5.5 Mixing of Fuel and Flush Salts

During 235y fuel operation, the uranium éoncentration of the flush
salt increased an average of about 215 ppm each time it was used after
fuel salt operation. During 2330 operation, with a lower uranium concen-
tration in the fuel, the corresponding increase should have been only
- 39 ppm. The actual increases during the three flushes after 233U fuel cir-
culation were 36, 42, and 39 ppm. Using these figures, approximately
40 1bs of fuel salt. mixed with the flush salt during each flushing opera-
tion. (For more details on salt.analysis and interpretation of results,

see Reference 23.)

5.6 Primary System Leak

During operation the cell-air activity was continuously monitored
to detect any leaks from the primary system. No leaks were detected until
after the final fuel salt drain in December, 1969. At this time the cell-
air activity did increase which indicated a leak. Subsequent tests shoved
that the leak was at or near one of the drain-tank freeze valves (FV-105).

The activity was mostly xenon with some iodine, krypton, and noble metals.

 

Four days after the first release, there was less than 25 curies of xenon
and less than 50 millicuries of iodine in the cell. This was released to
the atmosphere without exceeding the release rate permitted by the MSRE
safety limits.? Co oo

} The probability of the leak resulting from corrosion seems remote. A
review of the operation of the freeze valve does not indicate any excessive
thermal stresses. No abnormalities were found upon reviewing the construction
x-rays and other inspection reports. It was noted, however, that the weld
‘between the air shroud and the. salt piping at the freeze valve was not
specified as a full ‘penetration weld. This led to the suspicion that the
leak may be a crack. that started at this point and was propagated by stress
cycling. Determination of the exact location. and nature of the leak will
be attempted during the post-operation examinations. More information

on the preliminary evaluation of the leak is given in Reference 25.

5.7 Operation

The operation of the fuel system was satisfactory. Difficulties en-
countered with the components are described in the following sections. The
rate of transfer of salt to the overflow tank was higher than expected.
Details on this and the loop void fraction and xenon poisoning are given in

Reference 18.

5.8 Fuel Pump and Overflow Tank

5.8.1 Description

The fuel salt circulating pump was a centrifugal sump-type pump with
an overhung impeller, developed at ORNL expressly for circulating molten
fluoride salts of the type used at the MSRE.26 (See Fig. 5-3 and 5-L.)

At the normal operating speed of 1189 rpm, it had an output of about 1250
gpm at a 48.5-ft salt head. About 50 gpm of the pump output was circulated
internally to the pump bowl via a spray ring to promote the release of
entrained or dissolved gaseous fission products. The gas space in

the pump bowl was purged with helium to sweep these to the offgas disposal
system. The helium was introduced just below. the shaft seal in the bearing
housing. Most of the gas flowed downward through the labyrinth between the
shaft and the shield block to prevent radioactive gas and salt mist from
reaching the seal. The remainder flowed upward to prevent any oil which
leaked through the seal from getting into the pump bowl. 0il for lubri-
cating the bearings and cooling the shield plug was recirculated by an
external pumping system. Helium bubbler type instruments were used to
measure the liquid level as a means of determining the inventory of salt
in the fuel system. Small capsules were lowered into the bowl to take
semples for analysis or to add fuel salt.

- The maximum height of the liquid in the pump bowl was limited by the top
of an overflow line (5-1/2 in. above the center line of the volute) which
connected to a 5.5-ft3 overflow tank located beneath the pump. Helium bub-
bler type instruments were also used for measuring the liquid level in the
overflow tenk. Since the overflow line extended to the bottom of the over-
flow tank, closing. a valve in the overflow tank vent line forced the salt
back to the fuel pump.

5.8.2 Barl eration

The fuel pump had been loop-tested with molten salt for 100 hrs at
1200°F before it was installed at the MSRE in October, 196k. After instal-
lation no significant difficulties were encountered during helium circula-
tion while the fuel system was being purged, during early flush salt opera-
tion which started on January 12, 1965, or during the criticality experiments.

A continuous, but ‘very slow, accumulation of salt in the overflow tenk was
observed throughout the early operation. (see 5.8.9.)

5.8.3 Examination of Fuel Pump after Criticality Experiment?”

The fuel-pump rotary element was removed for inspection in September 1965 |
_ at the end of Run 3. The pump had been used for circulating helium for 1k410
hours and it had been filled with: salt at the MSRE for 2120 hours, 16951 hours
of which the salt was ‘being circulated.’

~The pump was ‘generally in. good condition and appeared ready to be used
for full-power operation. The only dimensional change was a 0.006~-in. growth
of the pump tank bore dismeter where the upper O-ring mated with the pump
tank. | |

The most significant discovery was evidence of 8 small oil leak through

the gasketed joint at the catch basin for the lower oil seal. This oil had
run down the surface of the shield plug, where it had become coked by the
higher temperatures near the bottom. Some of the oil had reached the upper
O-ring groove at the bottom of the shield plug and had become coked in the .
groove, but none appeared to have lesked past the O-ring during high-
temperature operation. Some fresh oil was observed below the ring after
the rotary element had been moved to the decontemination cell, but it was
believed that this oil dripped from the open lines during the transfer to
the’ cel.” : :

 

*a11 during’ ‘subsequent’ operations, considerable" aifficulty was en-

"countered from plugging of the main offgas system, due largely to decom-

 

position products of oil. that had lesked into the pump-bowl. (See

" Chepter 8.) Because of this trouble, the gasketed Joint was seal-welded
on the spare rotary element. ‘However, the spare never had to be installed

‘at the MSRE. :
 

 

rT

 

A layer of flush salt about 3/8-inch deep containing about 40 in.3
was trapped and frozen on top of the labyrinth flange. Apparently the
salt had drained through the 1/8-inch diameter holes in the flange until
surface tension effects balanced the hydrostatic head. This layer can be
seen in Fig. 5-5, which is a photograph tsken during the inspection. This
photograph also shows the contrast between the surfaces exposed to the
salt, which'were bright but not corroded, and those above the salt, which
were distinctly darker. There was a coating of fine salt mist particles
on the lower face of the shield plug and in an "O"-ring groove around the
shield plug there were small amounts of flush and fuel salt that must have
been transported as mist.

The pump was reinstalled using remote maintenance techniques so that
these techniques could be evaluated. Four universal joints on the flange
bolts that had been found broken during the disassembly were repaired prior
to the reinstallation of the rotary element. These failures resulted from
excessive bolt torque that had been used earlier to obtain an initial seal
on the flange. (Tt turned out that the jack screws had not been fully
backed off before the flange bolts were tightened.)

5.8.4 Pump and Pipe Support Problem

A problem related to the overall fuel-pump installation became evident
during the post-criticality shutdown in the fall of 1965. The fuel pump
could move in the horizontal plane, but was fixed against vertical movement.
The heat exchanger could move horizontally; the heat exchanger support frame
was fixed against vertical movement at the north end, but was mounted on
spring supports at the south end. The south end of the heat exchanger was
coupled to the fuel-pump bowl by a short length of 5-in. Sched.-lU0 pipe.

The heat exchanger was supported from below, and the pump bowl was supported
from gbove. The connecting piping was supposed to move upward at the heat
exchanger and downward at the pump when the system was heated.

Because of the physical arrangement of the piping and equipment, stress
ranges in the piping due to thermal cycling were calculated to reach a
maximum of 20,000 psi, which is acceptable. Uncertainties existed in

critical parts of the heat exchanger, however, particularly in the nozzle

o

where estimates were as high as 125,000 psi during cycling from 150 and

1300°F. The end of the exchanger toward the pump bowl was therefore

mounted on springs. This should have reduced stresses in the nozzle to the

range of 20,000 to T0,000 psi.

Careful observations during a heating cycle to 1200°F, showed that the
equipment did not move as expected, however. Because of the complex equip-
ment configuration and the inevitable uncertainty of the calculations, it
was decided to make strain gage measurements with the equipment cold and
moving the piping by mechanical means for measured distances with measur-
gble loads. The highest stresses were found to be in the fillet where the
nozzle was welded to the heat exchanger head when a spring force of 2000
pounds was exerted to raise the end of the heat exchanger 3/16 in. The
measured stress in the fillet was 13,000 psi and was a factor of about
5 greater than the stress in the nearby piping. Dye-check of the nozzle
to the head of the heat exchanger showed no indication of cracks.

The conclusion from these tests was that the mounting arrangement was
adequate to ellow the system to go through more than the 50 thermal cycles
required without a fatigue failure. The system was then put to use for

power operation.28

 

5.8.5 Effect of Bubbler Flow Rates on Indicated Fuel-Pump Level

The fuel-pump level was determined by bubbling helium through the selt
and measuring the differentiel pressure between this line end a reference
line which connected to the gas space of the pump (see Fig. 5-6). The end
of one of the bubbler dip tubes (596) was 1.8Th in. lower than the other
(593). A common reference line (592) was used for the two bubblers. The
level readout instrument had a full scale (0-100%) range of 10 inches of
salt. The centerline of the volute was at 35%. Compensation was provided
in the instrumentation for changes of density between flush and fuel salt
and for differences in the lengths of the bubbler tubes.

Since the d/p cells used to indicate level were located outside the
reactor cell, there was some pressure drop in the lines between these and
the pump. The amount of pressure drop was dependent upon flows through the
lines. Tests were made early in 1965 to establish the relationship between

these flow rates and the indicated levels.

Data for the upper probe are presented in Fig. 5-7. The curves for
the lower probe were similar. It can be seen that the indicated level de-
creased with increasing pump-bowl reference leg flow and that the indicated
level increased with increased flow into the dip tubes. The actual salt
level was not changed during the tests. Normal operating conditions were
set at 25-psig forepressure on all three of the bubbler flow elements,

5 psig in the fuel-pump cover ges. |

5.8.6 Fuel-Pump Level Changes and Limitations

Based on the recommendations of the pump development group at ORNL, the
level alarm and interlocks were originally set as shown in Table 5-1.

The differences in the level et which the fuel pump could be started
(64%) and the level at which the pump would ‘automatically stop (55%) was
necessary because the indicated level decreased 10 to 12% immediately upon
starting the pump. This was due to £illing the spray ring and fountain flow
chamber. : :

The narrow differences between the high and low alarm and control set-
points caused considerable operational difficulties. ‘Prior to starting the
pump after a fill, the average loop temperature could not be sccurately
determined. Since the fuel-pump level changed about 12.4% per 100°F change
in loop temperature, the selected fill point was not always satisfactory for
operation. In which case the freeze valve had to be thawed and the system
level adjusted. During operation the reactor outlet temperature was usually
held constant when the power was changed. Therefore, the bulk average tem-
perature changed with power changes and this caused changes in the fuel-pump
level. In addition to this, experiments were run which required operation
at different reactor outlet temperatures. During load and rod scrams the
system cooled rapidly. Sometimes it was necessary to reheat the system
before restarting the pump. The operating levels were further restricted
when it appeared that the offgas plugged more rapidly when the salt level
. was gbove 60 to 65% and gas entrainment in the fuel loop seemed to increase
below gbout 50%. The problem was further compounded by the changing pump-
bowl level due to salt transfer to the overflow tank.l8

Tests were therefore performed whereby the interlocks were bypassed and
the pump was started and operated at lower levels. Since there appeared to
be no cavitation or adverse effects on the pump, the interlocks given in
Table 5-1 were changed to 78%, 75%, 55%, 40%, and 38% late in 1965.

Normal level during operation was still maintained between 50% and 60% due
to gbove considerations. However, recovery after a load and rod scram was

much easier.

5.8.7 Coolant Air to Fuel Pump

In the design of the MSRE, it was calculated that the upper portion of
the fuel-pump tank would be subject to substantial heating from fission
products in the gas space above the salt. Since the useful life of the
pump tank would be limited by thermal-stress considerations at the junction
“of the volute support cylinder with the spherical top of the tank, close
control was at first maintained over the temperatures in this region.

Design studies had indicated that the maximum lifetime would result. if

the junction temperature were kept sbout 100°F below the temperature on

the tank surface 6-in. out from the junction. Component cooling "air"

(95% N,) was provided to maintain this temperature distribution. A secondary
consideration in controlling the temperatures was a desire to keep as

much of the pump tank as possible above the liquidus temperature of the
salt. Ca - :
In operating the reactor, it would be ideal if a fixed flow rate of
air over the pump tank would provide a satisfactory temperature distribution
. for 811 conditions. Early design calculations indicated that this condition
“could be met with an air flow of 200 cfm.2? However, temperature measure-
ments on the pump-test loop and during the initial heatup of the MSRE indi-
| cated that only ebout 50 cfm would be required, and that the air would have
to be turned off when the pump tank was empty.
© To minimize the temperature effects when the cooling air was- turned on,

air flow during power operation was to have been set at the minimum that
would give the desired temperatures. It was found that en air flow of 30 cfm
gave sa satisfactory temperature distribution at all power levels. In order

to achieve and control this relatively low flow rate, & new valve, having

 
 

 

106

a lower C, had to be substituted for the original valve. Figure 5-8

shows the temperatures in the two regions of interest as a function of re-
actor power level with that air flow. The variations in the individual
temperatures were caused by variations in the pump-bowl. level salt tempera-
ture and air flow. Both the individual temperatures and the temperature
differences increased linearly with power, as expected. It was felt during

early MSRE operation that, although temperature differences would exceed

_ 100°F at full power, the reactor could be so operated with the 30-cim ¢ air

flow without significantly reducing the life of the pump tank.

When the reactor was started up for Run 8 in September 1966, an unex-
plained shift downward in these temperatures was noted. Later the cooling
air to the pump tank was turned off during the attempts to melt out the salt
plug in the 522 line, and although the temperatures on the pump-tank surface
were higher than with the cooling air, the temperature gradient was less.
Since the temperature distribution was as good or better than with the air

cooling, the use of air cooling was discontinued.

5.8.8 Salt Transfer to the Overflow Tank

Early operation of the reactor showed that by some unexplained mecha-
nism, salt gradually accumulated in the fuel pump overflow tank even when
the salt level in the pump bowl was well below the overflow point. The
transfer rate depended on salt level, and the transfer ceased when the
level was about 3 in. below the overflow point. This situation existed
until sbout April 1966, when transfer began to be observed at lower salt
levels. The rate appeared to increase gradually as time went on until
it leveled off in June and July at 0.57 1b of salt per hour, independent
of salt level as far down as 4.7 in. below the overflow point. The change
occurred at the time of the stepwise increase in power, but no mechanism
connecting the two has been identified. This rate of transfer continued
through the 235y operation and required emptying the overflow tank about
three times per week. oo

Prior to operation with 233y fuel salt, the flush salt which had been
processed to remove the 235y was circulated for 42 hours. During this and
the first 16 hours of fuel carrier salt circulation, the transfer rate and <

loop void fraction appeared to be unchanged from the previous periods. Two
hours after the start of a 12-hour exposure of a beryllium rod in the pump
bowl, the bubble fraction in the system increased from the normal 0.1 vol %
to about 0.6 vol % and the rate of transfer to the overflow tank increased
from sbout 0.4 1b/hr to greater than 4 1b/hr.

During the remsinder of the 233y operation the transfer rate was high
(up to T2 1b/hr) and variable. The results of the investigation of the
overflow rate, the changing bubble fraction, and subsequent power pertur-

bations are given in Reference 18.

5.8.9 Burps of the Overflow Tank

During early operation of the MSRE, when the overflow rate was very low
and the need to push salt from the overflow tank back to the fuel-pump bowl
was infrequent, the practice was to empty the overflow tank completely. The
sudden pressurization of the fuel pump at the end of the burp gave false
level indications and stopped the pump. Also when power operation was
started, it was noted that gaseous fission products were being pushed out
the oil seal line (524) by the sudden pressurization. Therefore, the
procedures were changed such that the overflow tank wes not completely
emptied of salt during operation.

- In February 1969, the main offgas line plugged to the point where it
presented a L-psi pressure drop to the normal 3.2 liter/m offgas flow.
During a burp of the overflow tank, this plug blew out with the reactor at
full power resulting in a complete burp of the overflow tank. On at least
three other occasions when the overflow tank was being emptied, the offgas

plug blew out causing more salt to be transferred than planned.

5.8.10 Varisble-Speed Drive for the Fuel Pump

Prior to February 1969 the fuel pump was always operated with the
normal 60-HZ power supply at - 1189 rpm. Then, in order to investigate the
effect of fuel circulation rate on system behavior (bubble ingestion, xenon
stripping, transfer to overflow tank, blips),1® a variable-speed motor-
generator set was brought to thé {MSRE to supply power to the fuel pump
during experiments. As described in Chap. 16," considerable effort was

o
 

109

expended in modifying and repairing the M-G set to obtain satisfactory
reliebility. The pump itself, however, operated with no. difficulty for
substantial periods at speeds between 50% and 105% of normal.

5.8. 11 Flooding ¢ of the Pump Bowl with Flush Salt

At the end of Run T in July 1966, the fuel loop was filled with flush
salt to rinse out residual pockets of fuel salt and thus reduce the radi-
ation levels for the scheduled work in the reactor cell. As the salt

 

 

wes overflowing into the overflow tank to rinse it out, the level in the
flush tank was lowered too far which exposed the bottom of the dip tube.

A large bubble of helium ges at-a pressure of about 30 psig entered the

~ bottom of the loop. As the bubble rose, its volume increased due to the
decreased pressure and the fuel-pump level increased faster than: it could
overflow to the overflow tank. Salt flooded the reference bubbler, the
annulus around the shaft, the sampler tube, and the main offgas line.

Several factors contributed to the accident.  Interlocks normally pre-
O vented filling to the overflow line. These had been bypassed to allow

flushing of the overflow tank. The flush-salt inventory was marginal at
normal opereting temperatures (1200°F). The flush-tank temperatures were
“low (about 1140°F) which made the salt more dense and thus there was an

insufficient volume.

5.8.12 Plugging of the Offgas Line at the Fuel Pump

: Intermittent problems vere encountered with plugging of the 1/2-in.

_ Sched-40 main offges line at a point just beyond where it left the top of
the fuel-pump bowl. In the ‘early years of operation, this either melted
itself free when the reactor was brought to ‘power, or it was periodically

reemed out when the reactor wes shut down, through the use of a mechanical,
flexible rotating "snake". In July 1969, a specially built heater assembly

~ consisting of two *1000-w formed calrods was installed’ remotely ‘around the
522° offgas line between: the ‘top of the pump bowl and the gas ‘cooling - "shroud"

 

of ‘the fuel pump. This, ‘together with back<blowing with helium, was suc-
cessful in clearing the line. "More details on the offgas plugging problems
are given in Chapter 8.

 

 
 

 

 

110

5.8.13 Conclusions and Recommendations

The fuel pump was used to circulate salt for 21,788 hours at tempera-
tures near 1200°F with no perceptible change in performance and no failure.
Some plugging of the offgas line was encountered. This should be con~
sidered in future designs. Perhaps dual lines could be used with heaters to
melt out plugs if they develop. Leakage of oil (1 to 2 cc/day) into the
pump bowl contributed to the offgas plugging problem. This possibility was
eliminated in the replacement rotary element by seal-welding a gasketed
Joint, but because the plugging problem was menageeble, the spare element
- was never installed.

The transfer of salt to the overflow tank was an operating nuisance in
that it had to be periodically transferred back to the pump. The Mark-II
pump (which has operated for over 13,000 hours in a test loop) has more
height in the pump bowl, eliminating the need for an overflow tank.

5.9 Primary Heat Exchanger

The primary heat exchanger was a horizontal shell and U-tube type.
During early power operation the heat transfer capability was found to be
considerably lower than expected. A reevaluation of the physical properties
showed that the thermal conductivity of both the fuel and coolant salts was
sufficiently below the value used in design to account for the overestimate
of the overall coefficient of heat transfer. Table 5-2 shows a comparison
.of the physical property data used in the original design to the current
data. The heat transfer coefficients calculated by the conventional design
procedures using these two sets of data are also shown.

The heat transfer did not ‘change during subsequent operation of the
reactor end no other difficulties occurred. The measured overall heat trans-
fer coefficients ranged from 646 to 675 with an average of 656 Btu/ (hr-£t2-C°F)
for 8 measurements. These measurements were made on the basis of nominal
full power at 8.0 Mw and a coolant salt flow of 850 gpm. If the actual
coolant flow rate were T70 gpm, which would be the flow consistent with =a
power level of T.34 Mw, the measured overall coefficient would be 594 as
compared to a calculated value of 599 Btu/(hr-ft2-°F). ‘The performance is

covered in detail in References 30 and 31.

5.10 Reactor Vessel and Reactor Access Nozzle

5.10.1 General Description

Reactor Vessel and Core — The reactor vessel was a 5-ft-diameter by
8-ft~high cylinder which contained a 55-in.~diameter graphite core. A
cutaway drawing of the reactor vessel and core is shown in Figure 5-9.

The vessel design pressure and temperature were 50 psig and 1300°F with an
allowable stress of 2750 psi.

The fuel salt entered the flow distributor where it was directed down-
ward around the circumference of the vessel. It flowed in a spiral path
through a l-in. annulus between the vessel wall and-the core can for cooling
purposes. Anti-swirl vanes in the lower head of the vessel straightened the
flow path before it entered the graphite moderator core. Flow passages,
formed by grooves in the sides of the graphite moderator bars, directed the
laminar salt flow to the upper head plenum. The salt flow then left the re-
actor vessel through the side outlet of the reactor access nozzle which is
described in the following section. : . (-

During operation the fuel salt was held in the circulating system by
a freeze valve (FV-103) attached to the lower head of the reactor vessel.

The drain line and freeze valve was a 1-1/2 in. Sch.-40 pipe which was

flattened for about 2 in. to give a flow cross section about 1/2-in. wide.

Cooling air in a shroud surrounding the flattened section maintained a frozen
salt plug for a "closed" valve. The 1-1/2 in. pipe extended 2-3/4 in. into
the lower head of the vessel and was covered with a hood for protection
against sediments collecting on top of the frozen plug meking it inoperative.
The 1-1/2 in. hooded drain thus would remove all but a small puddle of salt
from the lower head even if there had been heavy sedimentation. To provide
for drainage of the remaining puddle, a 1/2-in. tube was mounted through
the wall of the portion of the drain protruding inside the vessel and ex-
tended downward through the freeze valve below. This, in effect, formed
parallel freeze valves operated by the same controls.

The reactor core consisted of 617 full and fractional size graphite |
elements 2 x 2 in. cross section and about 67 in. long. Salt flow channels

were formed by machined half channels on each of four faces of each element. (

When not buoyed by being immersed in salt, the vertical graphite elements
were supported by a lattice of graphite blocks which in turn are supported
by a Hastelloy-N grid fastened to the bottom of the core can. The ‘core can
was thus free to expand downward relative to its top attachment to the re-
actor vessel while the graphite was free to expand upward relative to its
support at the lower end of the core can. The graphite moderator elements
were restrained from floating out of the core by & Hastelloy-~N rod through
holes in the dowel section at the bottom of each graphite element. In
addition a wire passing through the upper graphite elements prevented the
upper portion. of a broken element from floating out of the core.

To prevent possible overheating in an otherwise stagnant ‘region, a .
small portion of salt entering the reactor was diverted into the region
Just above the core can. support flange in the annulus between the vessel and: .
the .core can. . Vessel wall temperatures in this region and also ‘the. lower
head were moni tored during operation for possible deviations.

At the center. of the core were located sample specimens, ‘three control
rod thimbles, and five removable graphite elements. The sample specimens
were located in one corner of a 4-in. square with the three control rods
occupying the other three corners. The five removable:elements: then occupied
the remaining spaces between these four. positions. The controls rods are
described elsewhere in this report (Chapter 19).

The sample specimen assemblies mentioned above were made of various com-
binations and arrangements of graphite and metal. They were exposed to much
the same salt velocity, temperature, and - nuclear flux as the core matrix.
These are described in general elsewhere in this section. ]

The reactor vessel was supported. from the ‘top removable cover of the
‘thermal shield by twelve hanger-rod -assemblies. These hanger-rod assemblies
were pinned to lugs welded to the reactor vessel Just above the flow dis-
tributor. The support arrangement was such that the reactor vessel could be
considered to be anchored at the support lugs. The portion of the vessel
below the lugs was free to expand downward with no restraint.

Reactor Access Nozzle (RAN) — Attached to the upper head of the reactor
vessel was ‘a 40-in. long 10-in.-diam nozzle. The nozzle had a S5-in.-diam

i so
side outlet for the leaving salt located about 10 in. above the reactor
 

i15

vessel upper heed. The remaining extension of the 10-in.-diam nozzle pro-
vided a pocket of trapped gas during the filling of the reactor. However,
most of the volume of this extension was occupied by the nozzle plug which
is a removable support for the three control rod thimbles, the 2-1/2 in.
graphite sample access pipe, and for the discharge screen. - See Fig. 5-10.
Conventional lesk-detected metal oval-ring-Jjoint flanges were used on both
sample access openings to provide the necessary containment of the primary
system. The radisl clearance between the removable nozzle plug and the
nozzle was 1/8~in. at the top and 1/b-in. at the bottom to provide a tap~
ered annulus. It was intended that salt be frozen. in this tapered annulus
providing a salt seal to prevent molten salt from contacting the metal seal-
ing surfaces. However, maintaining a frozen salt seal was found to be not
possible, This is discussed .in more detail later, Cooling air was pro-
vided on both inside of the plug and outside of the 10-in. nozzle but only
to the inside of the plug of the 2-1/2 in. graphite sample access. Heaters
were provided to thaw any frozen salt remaining in the 10-in. annulus after
a salt drain. For thawing the 2-1/2 in. annulus the cooling tube was re-~
moved from the plug as part of the sampling procedure and temporarily re-~
placed with a metal sheathed heater.

Some twenty thermocouples (not including spares) were installed at
various locations on the RAN to monitor temperatures of the nozzle, both
plugs and. control rod thimbles. A thermocouple well attached to the
graphite-sample access plug extended into the flowing salt stream to indi-
~ cate reactor outlet temperature. on }

Strainers were provided at the reactor outlet to prevent passage of
graphite chips larger than 1/16 in. A strainer basket was attached to the
lower end of the 10-in, nozzle plug and extended downward into the upper
head region of the reactor vessel.:: The three control rod thimbles and the
graphite sample assembly passed through the strainer basket. Since the
five graphite elements were not pinned as were the remaining moderator ele-
ments, a cross-shaped extension of the basket assembly projected beneath
the basket to provide a hold-down, See Fig. 5-11.

- The. core sample specimens ‘were removed and replaced only when the re-

actor was drained of salt and partially cooled. The specimens were removed

through the smaller of the two access nozzles described earlier. A stain-
less steel standpipe was left attached to the small graphite-sample access
nozzle via a bellows. The upper end of the standpipe was bolted to a liner
set into the lower concrete roof plug. During normal operation the liner
opening was closed with a concrete plug. When samples were to be removed,
this plug was replaced with a work shield which contained openings for
tools, lights, etc. All Joints were moderately leak-tight and the stand-
pipe was provided with a nitrogen purge and offgas connections. A Roots
blower located in the service tunnel provided a lightly negative standpipe
pressure to assure inward leakage.

Core samples were teken by removing the graphite sample access flange,
withdrawing the sample into the standpipe, placing the sample in a special
carrier, inserting a replacement sample specimen into the core, and re-

placing the access flange.
5.10.2 Heat Treatment of Reactor Vessel

After the reactor vessel was installed, tests of the particular heat
of Hastelloy~N used in the vessel showed that the closure weld between the
top head and the flow distributor ring could have poor mechanical proper-
ties in the as-welded condition. Therefore in the fall of 1965, the reac-
tor vessel was heat-treated in place, using installed heaters, for 90 hours

at 1LOO°F.
5.10.3 Reactor Access Nozzle Freeze Tests and Effect of Circulating Bubbles

The main purpose for a frozen salt seal in the annuli of the 10-in. and
2-1/2-in. diam. RAN plugs was to prevent contact of the sealing surfaces
with salt. The freeze flanges used as piping disconnects have a similar
function. The main difference being thet the freeze flanges incorporated
a radial freeze Joint while the RAN employed a longitudinal freeze joint.

During development on the Engineering Test Loop freeze Joint, it was
noted that a frozen salt seal could not be maintained reliebly if in con-
tact with molten salt. It was intended to operate the MSRE RAN freeze
‘Joint with a ring of frozen salt above the normal molten-salt level. This
would be accomplished by pressurizing the fuel system above normal operat-

ing pressure soon after filling the reactor with salt. Cooling air on the
 

119

RAN would freeze a ring of salt in the annuli before the pressure was low-
ered to its normal value, leaving a gas void between the frozen and liquid
salt. The gas trapped in the RAN annuli was thus the principal barrier
between the molten salt and the containment sealing flange. The ring of
frozen salt would then serve only as a backup protection against sudden
pressure increases forcing salt up into the annuli.

The first attempts to form this backup seal in this manner on the MSRE
RAN were unsuccessful due to. insufficient cooling air although the availa-
ble flow met the requirements of the design ‘calculations. 6 The flow was
permanently increased from about 3 cfm to ‘the range of 15 to 20 cfm by
modifying the control valve trim. Even with the increased sir flow, there
was sufficient movement of salt in the annuli due to the turbulent flow
below to prevent forming a good frozen-salt seal. However, gas trapped
above the molten salt kept the liquid level well below the flange. The
liquid gas interface changed in height due to any change in volume of the
gas pockets. During early operation, the interface was at least a foot
‘below the flange and the flange temperature was about 200°F. During later
operations, there were ‘periods when the salt level was “higher and the tem-
perature of the flange approached 300°F.

There were two mechanisms which caused gas to be transferred to and
from this pocket. Gas was transferred from the pocket as ‘a solute and
added by entrapment of circulating bubbles from the salt stream below.

The equilibrium difference between these two transfer rates determined the
salt level in the annuli and thus the ‘temperature readings of the wall.

Any change in ‘reactor operating conditions which. disturbed the balance
between these two ‘transfer mechanisms would thus change the height of salt
in the annuli. It was noted that the salt level in the RAN annuli would
be increased by any of the following. changes in operating conditions:
lowering 1 the system pressure (cover gas in the fuel pump) , increasing cir-
culating salt temperature, or decreasing the amount of circulating bubbles
(i.e. decreasing pump speed).

Examples of all three of these causes are shown in Figs. 5-12 and 5-13.

Please refer to Fig, 5-10 for location of the thermocouples used in these

two graphs.

The effect of temperature and pressure can be seen in Fig. 5-12, At
the beginning of the observed time period, the salt level in the RAN was
relatively low with the pump pressure higher than its normal S psig. After
a pressure drop on February 6, the salt level overcame the immediate effects
of pressure and began to rise as indicated by the R-43 thermocouple. Sev-
eral days later the reactor outlet temperature was changed in two small
steps of 30° and 15° yet note the very large effect of almost 600°F on the
R-7 thermocouple due to the salt level increase. Later by raising the pump
pressure from 3 to 5 psig the salt level is again lowered in the RAN annulus,

The effect of a direct change in the amount of circulating bubbles cen
be seen in Fig. 5-13. At the beginning of this period the fuel-pump speed
was lower than normal and it can be seen that the RAN salt level was very
high. Other indications such as the reactivity balance led to the conclu-
sion there were no bubbles circulating at this condition. When the fuel-
pump speed was increased, with no other change in operating temperature or
pressure, the RAN salt level dropped very rapidly. "(Note the abscissa in
Fig. 5-13 is now hours instead of days.)

Circulating bubbles were involved in more dramatic effects than tem-
perature changes in the RAN, of course. Some more important variables were
involved such as the effects of circulating voids and xenon poisoning on
the reactivity balance. The effects seen in the RAN temperatures only
helped explain the cause of some other events.

One phenomenom noted in which it is thought the RAN trapped gas had a
direct relationship is that of power perturbations in the MSRE in January,
1969. There was an unusually large amount of circulating bubbles at this
time as verified by several indications including low RAN temperatures.

It is thought some gas, clinging to the core, was suddently swept from the
core causing a momentary increase in reactivity. The triggering mechanism
for release of gas clinging in the core was presumably 8 very small pertur-
bation in flow or pressure. An occasional release of a burst of gas from
the RAN which was suddenly compressed in the pump could have been the cause
of such perturbations. There were other indications to connect the RAN

trapped gas with the power perturbations.*’

5.10.4 Core Specimen Installation and Removal

Throughout the operation of the MSRE with salt in the primary loop
there was a sample array of one kind or another in the core. The arrays
that were exposed between September, 1965 and June, 1969 were of the de-
sign shown in Fig. 5-14. The array that was in the core from the time of
construction until August, 1965 contained similar amounts of graphite and
INOR-8 (to have the same nuclear reactivity effect) but differed in inter-
nal configuration. In 1969, during the last five months of operation, a
different array, designed to study the effects of salt velocity on fission
product deposition, was exposed in the core.

| A core specimen assembly of the type shown in Fig. 5-14 consisted of
three separable stringers (designated R, L, and S). Whenever an assembly
was removed from the core, it was taken to a hot cell, the stringers were
taken out of the basket, and a new assembly was prepared, usually including
one or two of the previously exposed stringers. Sometimes the old basket
was reused, sometimes not. - The history of exposure of INOR-8 specimens in
this kind of array is outlined in Fig. 5-15. The numbers indicate the
heats of INOR-8 from which the rods in each stringer were made.

The following section describes the experience with installation and
removal of core specimen assemblies, with emphasis on the procedures, tools,
and systems involved. Descriptions of the materials that were exposed and
the results of their post-operation examinations are given in detail in

{

references 32—36.

Pre-Power Array —~ The specimen array that was in the core during the
prenuclear testing and nuclear startup experiments differed internally from
the later surveillance assemblies, but externally it was similar and its
installation and removal employed the equipment and procedures proposed for
later use. The original installation was in 1964, before salt had been cir-
‘culated, and, although done remotely, was closely observed to determine
needs for modifications in the tools and procedures. The assembly was re-
moved in August, 1965 by the remote procedure. (At that time the salt was
slightly radioactive from the 2?*U startup experiments.) Only minor diffi-

culties were encountered with some of the tools and fixtures.

While the core access was open for the sample removal, a visual in-
spection was made of the core with a 7/8-in.-diam. scope. The inspection
revealed that pieces were broken from the horizontal graphite bar at the
bottom of the core that was supposed to support the sample assembly. The
broken pieces were recovered, using a vacuum cleaner. To circumvent this
damage, the new sample assembly to be installed was modified to be sus-
pended from above, using a special fitting installed in the strainer bas-
ket above the core. This fitting (the "basket lock" in Fig. 5-14) had
spring fingers that locked into the strainer screen when it was pushed
into place. The lower end of the sample basket was extended to reach the
hole in the lower horizontal graphite bar to provide lateral support.

Array 1. Installation of the basket lock and the first standard ar-
ary in the core in September, 1965 was uneventful. The array was removed
in July, 1966 after about 1087 equivalent full-power hours (EFPH) of opera-
tion. When the array was examined in the hot cell, portions of the string-
ers were found to have been damaged. Some obstruction’ (thought to be salt
in the annulus) had been encountered in lifting the assembly through the
access nozzle. The damage was not caused by handling, however, but by con-
traction during cooldown. When the core was drained some salt was trapped
between the ends of graphite specimens where it froze and interfered with
the differential contraction of the parallel graphite and metal columns
during cooldown. As a result the graphite columns buckled.

Array 2. Because of the damage, none of the three stringers from the
first array were included in the second. The new stringers were modified
to prevent trapping of salt, but otherwise the array was like the first.
The second array was installed on Sept. 16, 1966, near the end of the 2-
month shutdown to replace the main blowers.

The second array was removed in May, 1967. By this time the reactor
had operated 4510 EFPH and the samples were removed sooner after the end
of power operation, so the salt was more highly radioactive than before,
resulting in troublesome contamination on the tools and in the standpipe.
This slowed the operation somewhat and it was necessary to install a char-
coal filter in the standpipe vent line to limit iodine release to the stack.
Difficulty was encountered in obtaining a satisfactory seal on the reactor
access flange, which required replacement of four bolts. Hot-cell examina-

tion of the array showed that the basket lock had pulled out of the strainer
127

screen and was stuck on the basket. A new basket lock was therefore fabri-
cated and was installed in the screen.

Array 3. The third array consisted of one new stringer and two
stringers previously exposed in Array 2, so it was highly radicactive at
the time of installation. No particular difficulty was encountered in
handling the array, however, since the equipment and procedure were de-
signed for this condition. A satisfactory seal on the core access flange
was not obtained on the first try, and inspection showed the O-ring gasket
was dented ‘and scratched. The bolt holes were cleaned and retapped and a
new gold-plated gasket was installed. An acceptably tight joint was then
obtained. Co

Array 3 was removed on April 2, 1968 after the conclusion of 22*U
operation (9005 EFPH). - Some ‘inconvenience resulted when the closure on
the transport containment liner refused to operate properly, but the re-
‘moval and transfer were safely accomplished without the liner. While the
array was out of the core the flange was sealed with a rubber-gasketed
blind flange to avoid possible damage to ‘the permanent sealing surfaces.-

Array 4. One of the old stringers and two new stringers made up
Array 4, which was installed uneventfully on April 18, 1968. This array
was removed in June 1969, at 11,555 EFPH. The removal was delayed. for
several days -due to problems with the removable heater that was required
to melt the salt from the tapered annulus between the removable plug and
the 2-1/2~4n. access nozzle, For the first time, flush salt was not cir-
culated just prior to the sample removal, The usual measures were taken
to control the radiation and contamination during the sample removal opera-
tion. There was some contamination of the immediate work area (mostly
noble-metal fission products) during removal of tools, which required
mopping.

Special Array. The final array ‘was all new and quite different in-
ternally from previous arrays. 37. Externally, however, it was practically
the same and standard tools -and procedures were used in its installation .

(July, 1969) and removal - (December, 1969) . Both operations were uneventful.

5.10.5 Radiation Heating

Radiation-produced heat in the reactor vessel walls caused the outer
surfaces of the vessel to be hotter than the adjacent salt by an amount
that was proportional to the reactor power. Any deposition of solids
would cause even higher surface temperatures. There were two locations
in the reactor vessel where solids could tend to accumulate. These loca-
tions were the lower head and the lugs located just above the inlet volute
and which supported the core matrix. The differences between the reactor
vessel temperatures and the salt inlet temperature were carefully moni-
tored during power operation so that this condition would be detected had
it occurred.

There was no indication of sedimentation during the operating life
of the reactor. The temperature difference did increase with use of **°U
fuel; this was expected due to the higher neutron leakage associated with
this fuel.

5.10.6 Discussion and Recommendations

The reactor vessel and core satisfactorily performed all functions
for which it was designed. Originally the operating life of the fuel sys-
tem was to be determined by the number of thermal cycles on the freeze
flanges. However, the design life of the freeze flanges was extended on
the basis of development tests. The stress-rupture life of the reactor
vessel was then reviewed to determine if the operation of the MSRE would
be limited by the possibility of stress-rupture cracking. The reevalua-
tion indicated the reactor could be operated at least another year longer
than its originally predicted 20,000 hours stress-rupture life.®®»%?

The reactor access nozzle also adequately performed all of its func-
tions. It was obvious, however, that some amount of bubbles circulating
with the salt was necessary to replenish the gas inventory of the RAN an-
nuli and keep the salt level down to the desirable level. The RAN design
was thus inadequate from the standpoint of providing a frozen salt seal

such as was the case with the freeze flanges. The inability to freeze a
 

 

129

salt seal was the result of a larger than anticipated salt flow in the
RAN annuli which increased the heat load beyond the capability of the

cooling air. provided. Additional thermocouples in the area of the RAN
would have allowed better definition of the salt level.

If an access flange such as the RAN is to be used again in a molten
salt system, there are three possible methods of obtaining its main func-
tion — that of preventing contact of salt with ‘sealing surfaces:

(1) Provide an external source of gas to the annulus. A salt level
determination would also be necessary.

(2) Provide an internal source of gas in the form of circulating
bubbles which would constantly replenish the gas inventory in the annulus.
A trapped gas pocket at a higher pressure than the pump cover pressure
will not remain indefinitely.

(3) ‘Reduce the access of flowing salt to the annulus by baffles,
labyrinth or such, so that a frozen salt seal can be maintained.

If bubbles are to be purposely injected into the fuel salt for the
removal of xenon and krypton, then item (2) appears to be the best solu-
tion. “The joint could be designed to remain essentially full of gas at
all times.

5.11 Fuel and Flush Salt Drain Tanks

5.11.1 ‘Description

Two fuel salt drain tanks (FD-1 and FD-2) were installed in the drain
tank cell for the safe storage of the fuel salt during shutdown periods.
A third tank (FFI), also located in the drain-tank cell, was provided for
storing the flush salt which was used for cleaning up the fuel circulating

system before and after maintenance.

 
 

 

130.

A fuel drain tank is shown in Figure 5-16. The INOR-8 tank was 50 in.
in diameter by 86 in. high, and had a volume of 80 ft3, sufficient to hold
in non-critical geometry all the salt from the fuel circulating system.

The tank was provided with a cooling system designed to remove. 100 kW of
fission product decay heat. The cooling was accomplished by boiling water
in 32 double contained bayonet tubes and thimbles in each of the tanks.

The fuel flush tank was similar to the fuel drain tanks, except that
it had no cooling system. Since the flush salt did not contain fissile
material, the only decay heating was from the small quantity of fission
products that it removed from the fuel system during the flushing operations.

The weight of salt in each of the three tanks was indicated by forced
balance pneumatic weigh cells. The weights were recorded on strip charts
but ‘could be read more accurately from installed mercury manometers. Two
conductivity type level probes (one near the bottom of the tank and the
other near the top elevation of the salt) were provided for use as reference

points.

"5,11.2 Calibration of the Drain Tank Weigh Cells Using Lead Weights

During early testing in the fall of 1964 the weigh cells were cali-
brated by loading the tank supporting rings with lead billets. The drain
tanks were at ambient temperature during this calibration. Drifts in indi-
cated weight of up to 39 lbs were noted when no changes were being made.
Repairs of air leaks in the instruments caused shifts of up to 65 lbs. The
weigh cells were further calibrated during the addition of flush and 235
fuel salt. (See below.)

5.11.3 Addition of Flush Salt and. Further.Calibration .of Weigh Cells

Later in 196k4, thirty-six batches of flush salt .(v250 lbs per batch)
vere added from cans in a portable furnace directly into drain tank FD-2
through a heated line and flanged dip tube attached at the inspection
flange on the tank. Each batch of salt added was weighed on accurately
calibrated scales and the tare weight of the container was checked to ob-
tain the net weight of salt added. All temperatures were maintained as
near 1200°F as possible. During additions some difficulty was encountered

with salt freezing in sections of the addition line. On one occasion the

drain-tank vent line plugged. To locate and remove the plug, the vent line
was heated with a torch, starting at the tank and working down the pipe
until gas could be blown through the line into the drain tank. The plug
blew loose while heating the line several feet from the tank. The plug
location, the relative low temperature required to remove the plug and some
oil found in the nozzle to the inspection flange on the tank led to the
conclusion that the restriction was caused by an oil residue.

During the addition of the first two batches of salt, weigh cell read-
ings were taken every five minutes to determine when the probe light came
on, Then this salt was transferred through the transfer lines to FFT and
FD-1 end back to FD-2 through the reactor fill lines. This operation left

salt in all freeze valves which were then frozen to isolate the tanks for

the first time.

While the salt was in the FFT, two more cans of flush salt were added
to FD-2 to recheck the location of the lower probe. In the two checks the
probe light came on when 469.6 and 492 1bs had been added to the tank.
These figures corresponded to weigh cell readings of 419 and 316 lbs. Af-
ter all of the flush salt (9230 lbs) had been added to FD-2, it was trans-
ferred between the three drain tanks. By using the weigh cells on both
tanks involved during each transfer, the weigh cells on FD-1 and FFT were
calibrated. The indicated weight at the upper and lower probes on FD-1
and FD-2 were also noted. The lower probe of FFT was not functioning (See
24,15). The weight between the probes was 7353 * 176 lbs for FD-1 and
7545 + 191 1bs for FD-2.

From the above data and subsequent operation, it was concluded that
the weigh cells are inadequate for precise inventory work. In general,
the longer the time required for a given operation, the larger the error
introduced. Transfers of small quantities of salt over short time inter-
vals appeared to give fairly good data. Using the tank weight at the lower
probe light as a fixed reference was useful in preventing the transfer of
too much salt to the fuel system and as an indication of the amount of salt
remaining in the tank after a fill. The implication is not that the weigh
cells were at fault. Pipe loading on the tanks caused by temperature
changes of the tanks and adjoining pipes probably caused the variations.
Errors as high as 200 to 300 1bs have been noted during transfers.
 

 

133

5.11.4 U-235 Fuel Salt Addition

The carrier salt and larger additions of 235y enriching salt were ad-
ded by the same general method used for adding the flush salt. Details of

these additions and the 235U criticality experiment are given in Ref. LO.
5.11.5 Salt Transfers.

Salt is transferred between drain tanks by pressurizing the supply
tank and venting the receiver tank. Originally transfers were made only
through the 1/2-in. transfer lines (107-110). In the event of a drain to
both drain tanks followed immediately by a refill of the circulating loop,
_ considerable time was spent freezing the fill freeze valves (105 and 106),
thawing the transfer freeze valves (108 and 109), refreezing them after the
transfer and then rethawing the £i11 freeze valves (105 and 106). After
careful consideration, procedures were modified to permit jumpering inter-
locks and transferring through the fill lines. No difficulties were en-
countered, however, all of salt could not be transferred this way since

the fill lines did not go completely to the bottom of the tanks.
5.11.6 After Heat Removal.

On 2/17/64 and 2/24/64, tests were made of the heat-removal capacity
of the steam domes. Flush salt was put into FD-2 and the salt was heated
to A1200°F. With 40 gallons of water in the feedwater tank (FWI-2), a
supply valve (LCV-807) was opened to admit this water to all 32 of the
bayonet cooling tubes. The water was refluxed for approximately two hours
with cooling tower water flow to the drain-tank condenser kept constant at
40 gal/min. The inlet and exit temperatures of the cooling tower water
© were monitored, as were the drain tank temperatures and feedwater tank
levels, At equilibrium conditions, FD-2 temperatures dropped linearly at
‘a rate of 86°F/hr. The heat-removal rate calculated from condenser cooling
water flows and temperatures was 139 kW/hr. The heat-removal rate calcu-
lated from the temperature-~decay rate of FD-2 and the heat capacity of FD-2
‘was 132 kW/hr., Lo

A second similer test wes made by opening the other supply valve
(ESV-807) and keeping LCV-80T closed. The flow through this valve was

 
 

134

marginal, the level in the FWT decreased slowly and the heat-removal rate
was only 110 kW/hr based on a water heat balance and 98 kW/hr from the salt
temperature decay rate. }

These data showed that the bayonet cooling tubes were more than ade-
quate to remove the design decay heat rate of 100 kW/hr (for 10-MW opera-
tion). Since the reactor was run at only approximately 8 MW, the margin
of safety was enhanced. :

Because of leaks through the seats. of the water supply valves, the
reactor was operated some of the time with the feedwater tanks empty and
procedures were written to manually valve water to these tanks if neces-
sary to remove afterheat. When the salt was divided about equally between
the two drain tenks, as would occur on an emergency drain, no heat removal
vas necessary. Turning off the drain tank heaters was sufficient to prevent
excessive temperature increases. For instance, on November 2, 1970, the
reactor was drained while operating at full power. 4380 1bs of salt drained
to FD-1 and 5130 lbs drained to FD-2. With the drain tank heaters turned
off, FD-1 temperature increased from 1060 to 1155°F in about 6-1/2 hours
and then started decreasing. FD-2 temperatures increased from 1075 to
1195°F in about ‘9-1/2 hours and then started decreasing.

5.11.7 Plugging of Helium Lines. at.the. Top. of.the.Fuel Drain: Tanks

The helium supply, vent and equalizer lines enter the top of the fuel
drain tanks via a common 1/2-in. Schedule-k40 pipe. In June 1969, this line
on FD-2 became almost totally plugged. The plug first appeared when the
main 4.2 liter/min He offgas flow was routed past the drain tanks due to
plugging in the regular offgas routes. The plug was at least partially
cleared by first heating the tank to A1275°F overnight and then backblowing
with helium at 42 psig. This technique was not successful when FD-1 line
plugged in August 1969. Due to this plug, fuel drained preferentially to
FD-2 during a planned drain on November 2, 1969. During the last drain on
December 12, 1969, the fuel was made to drain more equally by.deliberately.
closing the vent from FD-2 for part of the time during the draining period.
The result was that the total sali weights in FD-1 and FD-2 were within 5%
of each other after the drain had been completed.
 

135

5.11.8 Loading 233U into FD-2

After the fuel salt had been processed to remove the 235y, the re-
maining carrier salt was transferred from the fuel storage tank to the fuel
drain tanks. The method of adding 233y enrichment salt was different than
that. used for adding the flush salt and 2357 fuel salt. The loading equip-
ment as shown in Fig. 5-17 was attached to the access flange of FD-2. Cans
containing ~ 7 kg of uranium were lowered into FD-2 which contained half of
the molten carrier salt. When the salt had melted out of the can, it was
withdrawn into the shield. Mixing was accomplished by transferring the
salt between the two drain tanks. The 233y addition and criticality ex-

periment is described in detail in Ref. Ll.

5.11.9 Heatup and Cooldown Rates
These are described under heaters in Section 17.
5.11.10 Discussion and Recommendations

The fuel and flush salt drain tanks have functioned very satisfac-
torily. They were very sluggish thermally and therefore easy to control
during operation. The afterheat removal system functioned satisfactorily
when needed.

The weigh cells were not completely satisfactory for inventory pur-
poses. Piping stresses should be eliminated or other type instruments
provided, .

As with other offgas lines, the possibility of plugging should be con-
sidered. Perhaps two lines could be used with heaters attached to melt out

any plug which might develop.

6. COOLANT - SYSTEM

C. H. Gabbard J. K. Franzreb
oe M. Richardson

6.1 Description

The coolant circulating system consisted of a centrifugal-type coolant
pump and an air-cooled radiator which were connected to the fuel heat ex-
changer by 5-inch INOR-8 piping. The normal operating temperature was 1000
to 1100°F at full power. The coolant salt was circulated at 850 gpm. Dur-
ing shutdowns the salt was drained to the coolant drain tank. The piping
had low points on each side of the radiator. Therefore, two drain lines
‘and freeze valves were required. The circulating system was filled by

pressurizing the coolant drain tenk with helium and venting the coolant
bump.
6.2. Purging Moisture and Oxygen from the System: ~~

Before salt-was-charged into the coolant drain tank, oxygen and mois-
ture were purged from the coolant circulating system and the drain tank.
This was accomplished by first pressurizing the system to assure that it
was lesk-tight, then evacuating, and purging with helium during the heatup.
Details of the heatup are given in Section 17. The helium was introduced
at the coolant pump and coolant drain tenk and evacuated or vented through
the offgas system. The coolant pump was operated to provide circulation
in the loop. Purging continued until the system was at 1200°F and essenti-
ally no more moisture vas being released. Later analysis of coolant salt

samples indicated that the purging had been very effective.
6.3 Coolant Circulating System Calibration.and.Drain Time

After the coolant salt had been added to the coolant drain tank (see
Section 6.1) the coolant circulating system was filled and operated for
11 days. A test of the drain time indicated that complete draining could
be accomplished in approximately 12 minutes after the freeze valves thawed.
During the following fill the circulating system was calibrated. The drain
tank was pressurized in increments and the drain tank weight and the dif-
ferential pressure between the drain tank and the coolant pump were re-’

corded. The system calibration curve is shown in Fig. 6-1.

6.4 Operation

Other than the difficulties with the radiator described later, the
coolant system operated satisfactorily. No salt leaks were detected at

any time.
6.5 Coolant Salt Circulating Pump

6.5.1 Description

The coolant pump used to circulate the LiF-BeF; coolant salt was simi-
lar to the fuel pump. It did not have a spray ring since fission product
gas removel was not required. No overflow tank pr cooling shroud was in-
stalled. At the operating speed of 1750 rpm, it had an output of 850 gpm
at a T8-ft salt head. A small helium purge was introduced just below the
shaft seal in the bearing housing. Most of the gas flowed downward through
the labyrinth between the shaft and the shield block to prevent salt mist
from reaching the seal. The remainder flowed upward to prevent any oil
which leaked through the seal from getting into the pump bowl. O0il for
lubricating the bearings and-cooling the shield plug was recirculated by
an external pumping system. Helium bubblers and a float-type level instru-
ment were used to measure the liquid level. (A float-type instrument was
not installed on .the fuel pump.) The coolant pump was located outside the

reactor cell and could be directly maintained shortly after shutdown.

6.5.2 Operation
The coolant pump ran very well throughout the operation of the reactor.

As with the fuel pump, the narrow range of operating levels caused opera-

‘tional difficulties. Prior to starting the pump after a fill, the average

loop temperature could not be accurately determined. Since the coolant-
pump level changed about T% per 100°F change in. loop temperature, the se-

lected fill point was not always satisfactory for operation. “In which case

‘the freeze valves had to be thawed and the system level adjusted. The nor-

mel operating level was about 55% at full power (the level instrument had
a span of 10 inches for 100% and centerline of the volute was at 35%).

 
 

140

When the pump was first started after a fill, the level would drop about
9% due to a gas pocket in the loop and about 4% due to the pump fountain
flow,

During load and rod scrams, the system cooled rapidly which decreased
the level below the interlocks required for starting the pump. Without
circulation there was a possibility of freezing the radiator. An emergency
start switch was installed which ensbled the operator to bypass all inter-
locks and start the pump if freezing of the radiator appeared eminent.

Based on the oil found in the coolant pump offgas lines, there was a
small oil leak into the pump bowl. The offgas line at the pump bowl be-
came plugged occasionally and in November 1968, a clamshell heater was in-
stalled. This was used once and cleared the line sufficiently to permit
operation until shutdown December 12, 1969.

The float level indicator was not used for operation.
6.5.3 Conclusions and Recommendations.

The coolant pump was used to circulate salt for 26,026 hours at tem-
peratures between 1000° and 1200°F.

Some plugging of the offgas line was encountered. This should be con-
sidered in future design. Leskage of oil into the pump bowl could be elimi-
nated by seal-welding a gasketed Joint as described for the fuel pump
(Section 6.1). |

6.6 Radiator

6.6.1 Description

The nuclear power generated by the reactor was finally dissipated by
a coolant salt-to-air radiator. Salt flowed through the 120 radiator tubes
at 850 gpm where it was cooled from about 1075 to 1015°F at full power.
Approximately 200,000 cfm of air from the two stack fans flowed perpen-
dicular to the tubes and out the coolant stack. In passing through the
radiator, the air was heated about 100°F above the ambient inlet: tempera-
ture. The heat removel was adjusted to match the nuclear power produced
by raising or lowering the two radiator doors, adjusting the bypass damper,

or starting and stopping the main blowers.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

141

The radiator tubes were 0.75 in. OD x 0.072 in. wall x 30 ft long,
zee-shaped to fit into the insulated radiator enclosure. The body of the
enclosure supported the tubes and the electric heaters. Two hundred
twenty-five kW of heat were provided to prevent freezing of salt in the
tubes in case of a sudden loss of nuclear power (see Fig. 6.2).

The upstream and downstream faces of the radiator enclosure were
equipped with doors that could move up and down in a "U" shaped track. As
the doors moved downward into the fully closed position, camming devices
operated by the weight of the door forced them against the seals located
on the face of the radiator. The doors were raised and lowered by means
of cables driven by a single motor. Magnetic clutches and brakes permitted
independent operation of either door. In case of a load scram request or
an electrical power outage, the brakes and clutches were deenergized and
the doors fell closed at a rate which was limited by the inertia of fly-
wheels attached to the ends of the drive shafts through overrunning
clutches (v7 ft/sec). |

6.6.2 Early Tests and Difficulties.

Preliminary heatup and checkout of the radiator began in October 196k.
The main difficulties were due to insufficient insulation and warping of
the doors. As a result, the doors Jemmed and would not operate properly
and there was too much heat loss to reach operating temperatures. The tem-
perature distribution was poor and overheating of thermocouple and electri-
cal leads was encountered.

After unsuccessful attempts to correct these difficulties, the doors
were temporarily sealed to allow completion of the criticality tests while
new doors were being designed and built. -

During the last half of 1965, extensive changes, tests, and remodifi-
cations were made on the radiator assembly. New doors were installed which
provided more insulation facing the heat source and additional expansion
joints to prevent warpage. The "soft" seal gaskets were removed from the
doors and relocated on the radiator enclosure. They were increased from
3/4 in. to 1-1/2 in. wide for better sealing. A modified "hard" seal was

installed on the doors. The door guide channels were repositioned to

provide more clearance. Four cams were installed on each door to provide
more positive seals when they were closed.

Sheet metal door hoods were installed above the radiator to reduce the
air leakage into the penthouse. The synchro indicating device on the drive
shaft had not proved relisble since it was possible for the door to jam and
the shaft to continue to run in the downward direction. End rollers were
positioned to prevent side motion from jamming the doors. Additional upper
limit switches and mechanical stops were added to prevent lifting the doors
in the event of a limit switch failure. Lifting motor overload switches
were installed in conjunction with the stops.

The new doors weighed about 2700 pounds each which required the ad-
dition of two 20,000-pound capacity, l-in. stroke shock absorbers on each
door. Although it was recognized that with the additional weight, operation
of the existing brakes and clutches was marginal, no changes were made in
the lifting mechanism. Adjustment of the door-lifting cables so that the
doors hung straight did much to ease their operation in the slides.

The above modifications improved the heat distribution of the radiator
system. Two major difficulties were then encountered; one was the exces-
sive temperature rise in the pent house just above the radiator, the other
wes maintaining a negative pressure in the pent house with respect to the
high-bay pressure. This was needed for beryllium containment.

Efforts to correct these problems included relocating the heater lead
junction boxes, pulling the thermoplastic wire (194°F) from the junction
boxes to the heater leads coming from the radiator, spreading out the bead-
ed heater leads to improve the cooling air circulation through the wiring,
and, modifying the exhaust ducting to direct the sweep of cool air across
the wire troughs (v500 cfm). These efforts were successful in reducing

the temperature to about 100°F just above the insulation on top of the

radiator. Heat leakage around the door hoods and radiator enclosure was

reduced by welding up cracks, adding insulation, and installing boots

around the door-lifting cable openings in the door hoods. A 1-ft? cross-—
overduct was installed between the door hoods to relieve the pressure on
the inlet hood. The pent house pressure with respect to the high bay was
aided by the addition of a duct from the pent house to the inlet side of

 
 

 

 

144

the south annulus blower. This reduced the pent house pressure to ~0.1k
to ~0.28 inches of water without the main blowers. With both blowers in

operation, the pressure became slightly positive. :
6.6.3 Subsequent Operation and Modifications

The systems were heated and the approach to full power was started
early in 1966. The radiator functioned satisfactorily, however, due to
heat losses through the door seals; -it was difficult to heat the empty
radiator to an acceptable temperature distribution prior to a fill.

The heat transfer capability was found to be about 20% less than cal-
~ culated. The cause for this discrepancy has not been definitely established
but may be due to the large surface-to-air temperature difference which
existed. This is described in detail in References 20 and 36.

Coolant salt was frozen in the radiator tubes on two occasions. The
first occurred on May 19, 1966 when a building power failure caused a load
scram and loss of all electrical equipment. Two tubes of the radiator were
partially frozen as indicated by the temperatures reading about T5°F low.
These temperatures recovered a few minutes after the coolant flow was re-
established indicating that the plugs had thawed. |

The second incident occurred on June 27, 1966 when again the electri-
cal system failed, this time causing a coolant salt drain because of low
radiator outlet temperature. The coolant salt weigh cells indicated that
gbout 200 1bs of salt were held up in the coolant system. ©Since it was
probable that the salt was frozen in the radiator which had cooled below
the freezing point, the radiator was reheated and the system refilled. When
the pump started, the temperature scanners indicated that 5 tubes were fro-
zen and not circulating. These tubes thawed after several minutes of salt
circulation without damage to the tubes.

To reduce the possibility of this happening again, the control system
was revised so that a rod scram would also cause a load scram. The low-
temperature setpoint for a load scram was increased from 900°F, which is
only 60°F ebove the liquidus temperature, to 990°F, Other revisions were
made so that the coolant pump would not be turned off unless absolutely

necessary. A radiator door scram test was conducted from full power, and
 

 

 

145

these revisions were adequate to prevent freezing of the radiator as long
as the coolant pump remained running. The average temperature of the fuel
and coolant leveled out at about 1120°F.

On July 17, 1966, a sudden loss in power indicated that a main blower

hed been lost. Main blower No. 1 had failed catastrophically and pieces

of the aluminum rotor hub and blading had gone into the radiator duct. Af-
ter the radiator had cooled, examination revealed that pieces of aluminum
had passed through the radiator tube bundle, several dented tubes were
found, and several pieces of aluminum were stuck to tubes. Metallographic
examination determined there were no punctures in the tubing and the radi-
ator was safe to operate after each tube was thoroughly cleaned. The exact
cause of the blower failure was never specifically determined but examina-
tion of numerous "old" cracks in the blades and hub would indicate that
these were the probable point of origin. Flying debris caused some damage
to the heater lead wires, wire trays, etc. |

It was apparent from inspection of the "hard" sealing surface, which
wes mounted on the hot side of the radiator door, that a modification would
be required. The continuous strip metal seal was badly buckled and frac-
tured due to exposure to the rediator heat. The roughness of this surface
damaged the "soft" seal (two widths of 3/l-in. Johns-Mansville Thermocore
#C-197 square asbestos packing strips mounted on the face of the radiator)
so as to render this seal ineffective.

A short evaluation program of six types of "hard" seals resulted in
the selection of a seal made up of 2-1/4-in. long overlapping steel seg-
ments spaced 1/32-in. apart which was installed on the new doors. The test
further indicated that the np bar, to which the segments were plug-welded,
bowed as much as 3/16 in. on the 3-ft-long test section. The "T" bars in
the new doors were provided with expansion slots plus a tension bar mounted

“on the cold side of the door which was used for straightening the doors
- after heating.

Performance of the radiator enclosure and door was without incident
after the above modi fications were completed for the balance of the MSRE
operating period. Heat losses and mechanical operation were adequate.
Programmed maintenance on the lifting mechanism was performed when the op-

portunity presented itself. Miscellaneous small items, such as replacement

 
 

146

of the "soft" insulation along the top of the outlet door, replacement of
broken ceramic insulators on the heater leads within the enclosure, repair
of grounded heaters, etc., was the extent of the maintenance required. The
door on the inlet side of the radiator retained its shape and sealed reason-
ably well, the seal along the top and sides of the outlet door retained its
seal except for replacement of burned-out tape along the top. The bottom

~ of the outlet door continued to distort and, even after being straightened
several times, made a poor seal as a result of the door bowing away from
the soft seal on the radiator face. As long as the side and top seals were
intact, there was no chimney effect and the heat losses were within usable

6.6.4 Automatic Load Control

The heat removal rate at the MSRE was dependent upon the positions of
the radiator doors and bypass damper and on the operation of the main blow-
ers. These could be manually manipulated as desired. Instrumentation was
also provided to automatically sequence the operation of these components
so that the operator could use one switch for increasing or decreasing
heat removal rate. An intermediate radiator door setting with one blower
in operation and 1 MW of heat removed was to be used as the starting point.
Since it was found that the heat removal with the doors sat their minimum
setting of 12-in. was about 1.9 MW, the automatic system did not function
properly. The rest of the sequencing functioned properly during a test.
However, in view of the above and since manually adjusting the heat load
was not a disadvantage, the automatic load control was never used in the

operation of the reactor.

6.6.5 Comments and Recommendations

Assessment of the radiator containment, doors, and door-lifting mech-
enism is complicated by the many changes, large and small, which were re- |
quired before accepteble performance was achieved. |

The radiator enclosure difficulties can be attributed principally to
details of installation such as gross air leakage into and around the en-
closure as a result of cracks, unsealed openings, insufficient insulation,
lack of a sufficient number of expansion Joints, etc. The principal radi-

ator enclosure support "H" beam members were not vertical and therefore

U
 

 

147

the adjustable "U" shapped door guides located within these members had
to be remachined to prevent the doors from binding.

The lifting mechanism was unduly complex. A substantial increase in
both reliability and control would have been achieved by providing each
door with its own motor-gear reducer unit with a built-in brake on the mo-
tor rotor shaft. A small, fast-acting brake in the high-speed end of the
drive would have reduced the number of electromechanical devices and re-
duced or eliminated the problem of coordinating time constants between
clutches, brakes, and motor. The ebility to operate the doors  indepen-
dently was probably unnecessary.

The unrealistic close tolerances between the doors and the radiator
enclosure end distortions produced by thermal gradients, primarily in the
doors, required a massive effort to correct in order to provide the re-
quired seal, These factors should be given careful consideration in any

future design.

6.7 Performance of Main Blowers, MB-1 and MB-3

6.7.1 Description

The two main blowers are a part of the heat rejection equipment where
the heat generated by the reactor is dissipated to the atmosphere. The
blowers were manufactured by the Joy Manufacturing Co. and are the "Axivane"
type Model AR-600-360D-1225., The blowers are direct~connected to 250-hp,
1750~-rpm motors by a short drive shaft with a flexible shim coupling on
each end,

; Although the blowers had been originally purchased for another program,
they vere essentially unused ‘at the beginning of the MSRE program. The
blowers were each originally rated at 82,500 cfm at 15 inches of water or
“114,000 cfm of free air delivery. The MSRE radiator design requirement of
100,000 cfm from each blover at 9 inches of water was within the normal

- operating range of the blovers. Hed new blowers been procured for the
SRE, this same type of equipment, would have been considered a: satis-
factory choice. :

 
 

 

 

148

6.7.2 Preoperational Testing

The preoperational testing of the blowers consisted of about 25 hours
of total operation. When the blowers were first delivered and installed,
they were operated a short time (less than 10 hours) to provide the elec-
trical load for testing the diesel generators. The blowers were also oper-
ated for a short period of time prior to power operation of the MSRE to
check the radiator tubes for self-excited vibrations, to permit a calibra-
tion of the stack air flow instrumentation, and to determine if control
circuitry was necessary to avoid certain abnormal operating conditions.

During the abnormal operation testing, the blade pitch was found to be
less than the specified 20 degrees. The pitch was set correctly and the
test program was repeated. The tests indicated that the blowers would
operate satisfactorily at all the normal conditions, but that a "surge"
condition would occur if the bypass damper were partially closed when the
radiator doors were also closed. The manufacturer had stated during dis-
cussions of the test program that the "surge" condition could be expected
but that no damage would occur other than overloading the drive motors.

The blowers were shut down immediately after the "surge" condition was en-
countered and administrative control was used to prevent further operation
under surge conditions. A second pitch change was made to 22-1/2 degrees
immediately after the first full-power operation. This 22-1/2 degree pitch
gave the maximum blower performance within the power rating of the drive

motors.

6.7.3 Operating History

The aerodynamic performance of the blowers was satisfactory through-
out the operating life of the reactor. However, there were several me-
chanical failures which are listed in Table 6.1 and which are discussed .
below. This table also shows the effect of the failure on the -operation
of the reactor.

MB-1 Coupling Failure — After about 550 hours of operation, the flexi-
ble coupling on the motor end of the floating drive shaft failed during
operation of MB-1. The motor end of the shaft was then supported only by
the coupling guard, and the shaft whip that occurred as the blower rotor

coasted down destroyed the guard and also the coupling on the end of the
shaft near the blower. The shaft came to rest embedded in the sheet-metal
nose with the blower end of the coupling near, but completely severed from,
its mating flange on the rotor. The motor end of the shaft extended radi-
ally across the blower inlet at about the 4 o'clock position.

Scratches and dents on the blades indicated that some of the debris
from the failed couplings hed gone through the blower into the radiator
duct. However, the damage, except to the couplings, appeared to be super-
ficial and of little consequence. No additional inspection of the blower
was made. |

The primary cause of the failure, ve believe, was a fatigue failure of
the flexible shims. The exact cause of the shim failure is unknown. Some
home-made washers were found in the drbris that were not rounded as they
should have been. High stresses at the corners of these washers could have
started the failure, or the coupling could have been running with excessive
misalignment. The blower rotor and drive shaft assembly had been rotated
by hand when the final blade pitch change was made about 216 operating
hours before the failure. There may have been some cracked shims in the
coupling at that time, but the shims were still supporting the shaft.

The couplings were rebuilt with new bolts, washers, and shims. The
shaft was realigned, and the blower was returned to service. The couplings
on MB-3 were also disassembled and new shims were installed. The original
shims in these couplings were not in bad condition. Co

MB-1 Hub and Blade .Failure.— After about 650 hours of additional op-
eration, there was a second failure of MB-1l. This was a catastrophic fail-
ure of the blading and the hub of MB-1l. The outer periphery of the rotor
hub disintegrated and all of the blading was destroyed. Most of the frag-
ments were contained in the blower casing, but numerous pieces of the cast
aluminum-alloy hub and blades entered the radiator duct and some of these
actually passed through but did not seriously damage the radiator tube
bundle. Figure 6.3 shows the failed hub and typical pieces of the blading.

An inspection of the broken pieces of MB-1l revealed numerous "old"
cracks in the blades and in the hub as evidenced by darkened or dirty areas

on the fractured surfaces. One blade in particular had failed along a
 

 

151

large "old" crack. The hub had contained short, 1-1/2 to 2-inch, circum-
ferential cracks at the base of 8 of the 16 blade sockets and the failure
generally followed these cracks. Figure 6.4 is a piece of the hub showing
the darkened areas that indicated previous cracking at the base of the
blade sockets. Similar cracking was found in the hub of the spare blower
“that had been in storage and a continuous crack extending about 35% of the
circumference as well as some of the shorter cracks were found in the MB-3
"hub. No cracking was found in the blading of MB-3 or the spare blower.
The exact cause of the MB-1 failure is uncertain, but a blade failure at

- one of the existing cracks seems to be the most probable first event.

All three of the blowers were rebuilt by the manufacturer with new re-
designed hubs and lighter magnesium-alloy blading. The hubs were rein-
forced with radial ribs to reduce the bending moments in the areas where
the cracking had been observed. There have been no further cracking prob-
lems in either of the rebuilt units in about 11,000 - 12,000 hours of op-
eration. A more complete discussion of the failures and of the corrective
action that was taken is given in References 42 and 43. Fy

Thrust Bearing Failures — There were a total of six failures assoc- o
iated with the main thrust bearing or its mounting. Main blower MB-3 was
taken out of service on March 6, 1967 for a bearing replacement after the
vibrations had increased from a normal value of about .8 to 2.5 mils. The
bearing contained an excessive quantity of very old appearing grease, and
the bearing surfaces were severely worn and pitted. This bearing was ap-
parently from the replacement blower that had been in storage, and the
bearing apparently had not been cleaned and relubricated when the rebuilt
rotor was assembled. Improper lubrication was judged to be the cause of
failure. The bearing had operated about 1800 hours.

Main blower MB-3 was shut down a second time for a bearing replacement
on January 16, 1968, because of an increase in bearing vibration. Although
the vibration and temperature had been normal, the MB-1 bearing was also
found to be defective and was replaced at the same time. The MB-1 bearing
had one pitted ball, but the MB-3 bearing was severely damaged and one ball
had actually fractured. Figure 6.5 is a photograph of these two balls.

Since improper lubrication did not seem to be the cause of these two -

failures and since three bearings had failed in relatively short operating

times, the expected life of these bearings was calculated from an estimated
set of load conditions. The predicted life was 5000 hours as compared to
operating times of 6630 and 4800 hours respectively for MB-1 and MB-3. As
a result of this evaluation, the original radial-type ball bearings were
replaced with an angular-contact type having identical mounting dimensions.
The angular contact bearing had a greater thrust load capacity.

The angular contact bearings were apparently capable of satisfactory
life, but additional difficulty was experienced with the self-aligning
mount. The MB-3 bearing was replaced during a scheduled maintenance period

because of a thumping noise that was heard when the blower was turned by
hand. The bearing was found to be in good condition, but the wear pattern
indicated that the outer race had been misaligned with the shaft. The mis-
alignment plus the high radial clearance in this type bearing caused the
noise. No further difficulty was experienced with MB-3.

Blower MB-1 was shut down on September 17, 1969 because of an increase
in vibration. The vibration increase had been caused by excessive wear in
the spherical surfaces of the self-aligning mount. The replacement of the
mount also required replacement of the bearing. The new bearing failed by
overheating during its test run because of insufficient clearnaces in the
phenolic ball retainer. This bearing was then replaced with a bearing of
the original radial type that was on hand. This bearing was satisfactory
for the remaining operation of the reactor. The defective bearing was re-

turned to the vendor.
6.7.4 Surveillance of Blower Operation

Following the hub and blade failure of MB-1, a surveillance program
“for monitoring the operation of the blowers was initiated. Vibration pick-
ups were mounted horizontally on each bearing of the blowers and drive
motors and thermocouples were installed in each of the blower bearings.
A vibration meter with four -input channels was provided for each blower,
and the vibration of each bearing was recorded in peak-to-peak displacement
once per shift by the operating personnel. The thermocouples were moni-
tored by the computer and initially an alarm would be given if the tempera-

ture exceeded a preselected limit. This was revised later to alarm if the

 
 

156

temperature rise sbove ambient exceeded a limit. This permitted much
tighter operating limits because the ambient fluctuated with the outside
air temperature.

In addition to the displacement readings taken from the vibration
meters, an output was also available to display the vibration trace on an
oscilloscope or other high-speed recorder, Oscilloscope photographs were
taken for reference on new bearings and when the vibration meters indicated
an increase. Figure 6,6 shows a comparison of vibration traces from a nor-
mal bearing and from the bearing containing the fractured ball.

A complete inspection of the blowers including «a dye-penetrant examina-

tion of the hubs and blading was completed annually during shutdown periods.
6.7.5 Discussion and Conclusions

Following the major rebuilding of the main blowers in 1966, the oper-
ation has been generally satisfactory even though there have been several
power reductions caused by bearing problems. The total lost operating time
caused by the various bearing failures was 8 days of zero-power operation
and 9 days of partial-power operation. A better thrust bearing arrangement
could have been required. }

The surveillance program to monitor the mechanical performance of the
blowers has been very effective. All the bearing problems except the MB-1
pitted ball in January 1968 have been found by an increase in vibration.
When the ball fractured in the MB-3 bearing, a temperature increase had
preceded the vibration increase by several days. However, this tempera-
ture increase had gone unnoticed because the bearing temperature was well
below the limit that had been set. The computer program was therefore re-
vised to alarm on the temperature rise above ambient, and much tighter.
limits were selected based on the previous operating experience. This
alarm system was effective in detecting the defective new bearing on Sep-
tember 19, 1969. .

The operating experience with the vibration monitoring system has
clearly shown that the displacement meter alone is not adequate to monitor
the condition of the bearings. Some system of maintaining a history of
the frequency spectrum is also required. We used photographs of the oscil-

loscope trace to document the normal operating vibrations, and additional

photographs were teken for comparison when an increased vibration was indi-
cated by the displacement meters. A modification to the computer to in-
crease its sampling rate would have permitted the frequency spectra to be
generated by the computer. This would have provided a more convenient and
more precise spectrum, but some degree of background experience would still
be required for proper interpretation of ‘the spectra in either case because
there can be several normal frequencies. There were several instances of
abnormal vibrations when the bearings were not at fault. The final de-
cision to replace a bearing was made in each case by the sound and feel of

the blower during a coastdown from operating speed.
6.7.6 Recommendations

The main blowers were conventional commercial equipment which would
normally be expected to operate with a minimum of attention or maintenance.
The instrumentation of all rotating equipment is probably impractical in
regard to both cost and manpower. However, certain classes of equipment
should be instrumented and monitored on a routine basis. The equipment
should be selected on the basis of:

1. Size and cost

2. The accessibility during operation

3. The effect of shutdown on overall plant operation

4, The potential for self-destruction
Ideally the monitoring should be computerized but this is not actually
required.

Each type and piece of equipment will have its own operating characte-
ristics in regard to vibration or temperature, and these characteristics
may vary with the installation or operating conditions, Preliminary limits
may be obtained from the manufacturer or from Reference 44, but the final
operating limits should be selected from a background of normal operating
experience.

The experiences with the cracked hubs and with the original thrust
bearing design are indications that the Quality Assurance Program should
extend into the design phase as well as the fabrication phase of major or

critical items of equipment.

The coolant drain tank was similar to but smaller than the fuel flush
tank. It was 40 in. in diemeter by 78-in. high and had a volume of 50 £t3.
As there was essentially no afterheat in the coolant salt, cooling was not
provided. Two salt lines (204 and 206) and their associated freeze valves
were used for filling and draining the coolant circulating loop.

The weight of salt was indicated by forced balance weigh cells. The
weights were recorded on strip charts but could be read more accurately
from installed mercury manometers. Two conductivity type probes (one near
the bottom and the other near the top elevation of the salt) were provided

for use as reference points.
6.8.2 Calibration of the Weigh Cells Using Lead Weights...

The weigh cells were calibrated by loading the drain tank with lead
billets. The drain tank was at ambient temperature during the calibration.
There was good agreement between the manometer readings and the actual
weight added.. Difficulty was encountered with air and mercury leaks in
the readout system. The weigh cells were further calibrated during the
addition of coolant salt. -

6.8.3 Addition of Coolant Salt

Twenty-two batches of coolant salt (5,756 lbs) were added from cans in
a portable furnace directly to the coolant drain tank through a heated line
attached to the top of the tank. After the addition was complete, this
- line was cut off and welded shut. "A good linear plot of the manometer
readings vs actual weight was obtained except for a 150-1b step in the
curve which occurred when a broken fitting in the weigh cell tubing was
repaired. The relationship between the weigh cell readings and the loca-
tions of the probe lights was established.
~The weighing system on the coolant drain tank proved to be considerably
“more stable than on the fuel drain tanks. With 5756 1b of salt in the tank
at about 1200°F, the extreme spread of 40 indicated weights, taken over a

period of a week, was * 22 1b.

6.8.5 Discussion and Recommendations

No unusual difficulties were encountered with the coolant drain tank.
The weigh cells functioned satisfactorily, however, the trouble with the
fuel drain tank weigh system emphasizes the need for careful consideration

of piping stresses or the use of other type instruments.

“T.  COVER-GAS SYSTEM

P,. H. Harley

The MSRE cover-gas system consisted of a helium trailer for normal sup-
ply, two banks of three helium cylipders for emergency use, two parallel
treating stations for removing moisture and oxygen to a nominal 1 ppm by
volume, a treated helium surge tank, and two headers, 35 psig and 250 psig,
which supplied cover gas to the various systems. Each of the treating sta-
tions consisted of a dryer (molecular sieve), preheater, and an oxygen-
removal unit (heated titanium sponge). Moisture and oxygen analyzers could
be valved in to monitor the treated or untreated helium as desired.

7.1 Initial Testing

The components of the treating station were developed and designed
by the Reactor Division Development Section. The ‘performance of the sys-
ten was tested by measuring oxygen and moisture content of the cover gas.
upstream and downstream of the treating station to insure proper opera-
tion. Other testing at the MSRE consisted of leak-testing the system and
checking flow control and temperature controls. Thermal expansion of the
0, removal -beds during the initial heatup caused the 3-in. ring Joint
flanged heads to leak. After retightening the flanges, the units were kept
hot to prevent thermal cycling the flanges.

: Late tests indicated that ‘the ‘Fisher Model 67-H pressure regulator
.-which was installed to reduce helium from trailer pressure to 250 psig was

susceptible to moisture. diffusion through the diaphram. These tests indi-
. cated Victor Model VIS-201 and Grove Model RBX~20L4-15 were better from

 
 

 

 

162

this standpoint. The Victor model was less complicated and therefore was
installed in the MSRE.

The low-pressure cover-gas header was initially a 40-psi header which
was protected by a U8-psig rupture disc. During initial testing, this rup-
ture disc failed on several occasions without apparent cause. The header
pressure was subsequently lowered to 35 psig which was sufficient for all
normal operating requirements and did alleviate the problem, The safety
© 1imits20 (Lo He supply pressure) had to be lowered from 30 to 28 psig to
provide a margin from the normel operating pressure.

Four helium control valves failed in the first month of operation.
Some galling of the close fitting trim (17-4 PH plug and Stellite seat)
was apparently caused by the extremely clean, non-lubricating dry helium.
Other valves in the system, including the four replacements have operated

satisfactorily.

T.2 Normal Operation

Since putting the cover-gas system in operation in the fall of 1964,
sixteen trailers of helium have been used. About 21,800 ft3 of the
29,000 ft3 in each trailer was used before returning the trailer to be re-
filled. A trailer lasted about 4 months on. the average or an average usage
of approximately 180 cubic feet per day. Normal usage when the reactor was
operating was 260 cubic feet per day. Larger amounts were used during pur-
ging and filling procedures and very little was used during maintenance
periods. }

Although helium was the normal cover gas, during maintenance periods
‘the reactor system was purged with argon. Argon was also used during a
special study of circulating gas in the fuel. Bottles of argon containing
<b-ppm moisture were placed on one of the emergency cover-gas headers and
then fed through the heating station into the regular cover-gas distribu-
tion system. }

The cover gas was changed from one treating station to the other only
once in the five years of operation. This was done in February 1967 when
trouble was encountered in the power supply control circuit to the opera-

ting unit. Although the dryer which had been in operation prior to the

&
 

163

change was regenerated, there has been no indication that the capacity of
any dryer or Oj-removal unit has been exceeded. .

Spectrographic analysis of the helium received averaged 2 ppm oxygen
and -4,6-ppm moisture. After passing through the treating station, the
‘helium contained ~ 0.2-ppm 0, end from 0.5 to 10-ppm moisture. ‘The vari-
ation in. moisture analysis appeared to follow the ambient temperature of
the helium treiler and treating station. During hot weather the analyses
~ were high and.during cold weather the results were low. Fluctuations could
be seen from day to night temperature changes of several ppm moisture.

This fluctuation of moisture analysis was decreased by better heating of
the sample station location in the winter ‘and better ventilation of the
area during the summer months. } :

While investigating the moisture analysis problem, another dryer was
-installed in the main helium header between the normal ‘treating station and
the line to the analyzers. - Whether this second drying step helped is doubt-
ful but it did give assurance that the helium was as dry -as possible.

The electrolytic cell in the moisture analyzer cased considerable -
difficulty during early operation. The cell was replaced four times be-
tween June and October 1965, once in June 1966, and in January 1967. No
cell replacements have been necessary since ‘then. Apparently the quality
of the cells was improved. Only one electrolytic cell has failed in the
oxygen analyzer and that was in June 1965.

To check the final performance of the treating station in October 1969,
a cylinder of He containing moisture was connected to the analyzers. The
analyzers read 20-ppm moisture and 0.6-ppm 03. After the gas was run
“through the treating station it analyzed 0.9-ppm moisture and 0.2-ppn 0s.

There has only been one failure of the 48-psig rupture disc since the
initial testing. This was caused by improper installation. Each time the
60-psig fuel system pressure test was run, pressure was put on the back
side of this rupture disc to: _prevent it from breeking. ‘In August 1969,
when the backpressure was increased, the rupture disc started leaking.
During replacement, ‘the vacuum support was found to be on the wrong side
of the disc. Repeated flexing, when backpressure had been applied, was
the apparent cause of the failure. More importantly, the faulty installa-
tion had nullified the safety function of the disc.

 
 

 

164

T.3 Conclusions and Recommendations

The cover-gas system performed quite satisfactorily with a minimum
amount of maintenance or operator time. Since the moisture and oxygen in
the helium as received was very low, it is doubtful that the treating sta-
tions were really necessary. By obtaining analysis of the cover gas before
usage and having an on-line analyzer, the treating station could probably
be eliminated. In larger reactors, the treating station might be needed
to dry the early recycle gas. The MSRE charcoal beds remained "wet" for
a long period during early operation.

We have had considerable fluctuation in the indicated moisture. If
the treating station and analyzers were located in an area which had a con-
stant temperature, the analyzers would be more consistent. If no treating
station is used, the helium supply should be kept at a constant tempera-
ture. Rising temperature drives moisture out of the container walls and

decreasing temperature causés the walls to absorb moisture.

8. OFFGAS SYSTEM
A. I. Krakoviak

8.1 Description

-

The offgas systems were comprised of those lines, filters, charcoal
beds, and valves through which cover-gas flowed from the salt systems to
the environment. The off-gas systems for the coolant salt and for the
fuel salt were similar in many respects, but the coolant off-gas system
was simpler because it did not have to deal with the intensely radioactive

fission products found in the’ fuel off-gas during power operation.

8.1.1 Coolant Off-gas System :
Figure 8.1 is the flowsheet for the coolant off-gas system (simplified

© by the omission of elements which are not pertinent to the presentation

of operating experience in this report). Gas entered the coolant pump bowl
through bubbler level. indicators and as a purge to the pump shaft annulus.
The shaft purge flow was split, with some flowing downward into the pump
bowl and the rest upwards and out through line 526. The upflow was to
prevent oil fumes from coming down the annulus into the pump bowl. How-
ever, some oil (about 0.5 - 1.0 cc/day) did get into the pump bowl by a
leakage path around the shield plug. This oil was thermally decomposed
into vapors and soot that left with the off-gas through line 528.

Gas flows into and out of the pump bowl were continuous. Gas was

admitted at a fixed rate and the pump bowl pressure Was controlled by

throttling PCV-528 in the off-gas system. The driving force for the
upper gas flow (line 526) was the pressure differential 4cross PCV-528.
Gas ‘was normally vented from the ‘coolant drain tank only after a fill of

. the circulating loop, which was done by pressurizing the tank,

All piping in the coolant off-gas system was ‘1/2-inch Sch-40 stain-

‘less steel pipe. The: valves, filters, and traps are described in the sec-

--tion on experience. The system was located in the coolant drain cell,

which could be safely entered whenever the reactor power was shut down.

8.1.2 Fuel Off-gas System
As seen in Fig. 8.2, the flowsheet for the fuel salt off-gas was

basically similar to that for the coolant off-gas, but was more complex.
Three drain’ ‘tanks were ‘required in the fuel system (two for fuel, one for
flush salt) and an overflow tank was required. for the fuel pump bowl. A
major difference was that all fuel system off-gas was sent through charcoal
beds for fission product absorption before release to the stack. The gas
hold-up and cooler consisted of a 68~£t. length of 4-inch Sch-40 stainless
steel pipe. The ‘remainder of the off-gas piping with the exception of the
flexible jumper line near ‘the pump bowl and the line in the vicinity of
the particle trap and line. 557 was 1/2-1n. Sch-40 stainless steel pipe.
Therefore, at the normal - off-gas flow rate of 4.1 liters per minute, the
fission gases were at least 45 minutes old on ‘arrival at the particle trap
and approximately 100 minutes old on arrival at the main charcoal bed.

An auxiliary charcoal bed was provided to accommodate large venting
rates (for short intervals) such as were required during filling and
draining the reactor or during salt transfers. A sampling system was also
provided to study the’ concentrations of fission products and oil decompo-
sition products in the fuel off-gas.

The fuel off-gas system was contained and shielded and therefore re-
quired remote maintenance techniques for work on any portion upstream of

the charcoal beds. vg

8.2 Experience with Coolant Salt Off-pas System

A summary of the difficulties encountered with the coolant off-gas
system -is given in Table 8. 1. A description of these is given in the
following sections.

8.2. 1 Filter and Valve Difficulties

During early checkout of ‘the coolant system, the original pressure
control valve (pcV-528) which. throttled the off-gas from the coolant pump
‘was too small (Cy = 0. 003) for adequate pressure relief and was: replaced
by a valve having larger flow coefficient (c, = 0.02).

A sintered metal filter (tubular cartridge one-inch long by 1/2-inch
diameter) capable of stopping particles greater than 25u was installed in
the off-gas line to protect the pressure control valve. It was necessary
to replace this filter (because of excessive pressure drop) after only 24
days of service with salt in the coolant loop. Inspection showed that
the plugged filter was covered with amorphous carbon containing traces of
the coolant salt and INOR-8. A second identical cartridge plugged after
20 days of service and at the completion of Run 1, (see Table 3-2 for dates
of runs) it was replaced with one having 35 times the surface area. Cool-
ant salt was not circulated again for 3-1/2 months and then for only 118
hr. During circulation, pressure control again became erratic which indi-
cated an obstruction of either the filter or the valve. Both were removed
for inspection, and although there was no deposit on the filter, the valve
was partially obstructed by a black, granular material. Rinsing with ace-
tone restored the original flow characteristics of the valve, and it was
reinstalled for the next run. The filter was replaced with a similar one
but capable of removing particles greater than lu in diameter. The smaller
pore size was chosen because the black granular material was determined to
be a mixture of glassy spheroids of coolant salt approximately lu in di-
ameter and carbon or carbonaceous material.® It is not known whether
these materials were carried into the line continuously or were swept out
of the pump bowl by sudden venting. The valve was relatively trouble-free
after the installation of the 1p filter. The filter, however, experienced
gradual plugging and was changed or cleaned twice in 1966, three times in
1967, three times in 1968, and twice in 1969. The filters, when removed.
from the system, showed no evidence of foreign matter other than a light
film of oil in the filter housing and a light film of oil was transferred
from the porous metal filter onto the plastic bag used in removing the
filter.

Flow tests on the plugged filters showed pressure drops of less than
0.1 psi at flow rates two and three times greater than the normal MSRE rate
(essentially the same results were obtained on a test of the fuel off-gas
filter). Plugging in these filters was attributed to the liquefaction of
oil in the pores of the filter. The fact that the pressure drop (at nor-

mal MSRE flow rates) changed from ~10 psi before removal to essentially
 

 

 

 

171

zero when tested after removal was attributed to the removal of some of
the oil from the pores onto the plastic bag and rubber gloves during
‘removal and insertion of the filter in the flow test rig. The filters
were rinsed in’ acetone before reuse.

On several occasions when the filter became restricted and could not
be replaced during power operations, the output from the pressure controller
was switched from PCV-528 to HCV-536. The coolant pump pressure was then
' controlled with this large by-pass valve (C, = 3,5). Although the valve
was operated at essentially its fully open or fully closed position, ade-
quate pressure control was achieved because the check valve and back-
diffusion preventer offered an appreciable resistance to large flows.
During the May 1967 shutdown, the off-gas piping downstream of HCV-536 was
“changed to join line 528 downstream of PCV-528 rather than line 560. This
~ change routed the gas by the coolant system radiation monitor so that the
coolant off-gas could be monitored when it became necessary to use HCV-536
"to control the system pressure.

On one occasion late in reactor operations (September 1969) when the
filter becaue restricted, the coolant system pressure was allowed to reach
10 psig before remedial action was taken. During this test the pressure
in the system meandered back and forth between 10 and <5 psig for approxi-
"mately one month before exceeding 10 psi and thus requiring pressure con-
trol with the vent ‘valve (HCV-536). This pressure drop is in agreement
‘with the gas pressure required to enlarge or burst a film of oil from a
one-micron pore if one assumes that the bubble radius is the same as that
of the pore: The equilibrium equation for a spherical bubble is

oT
“where 0 = surface tension = 16 dynes /cm for oil: in the coolant © system, and
- rr = bubble radius = pore radius = 0. 5x 10-* cm. hs
" This calculation indicates ‘that ‘any pore in the sintered metal filter
“smaller than lu, once’ ‘plugged ‘with condensed oil vapors, would remain
plugged at pressure differentials of less than 9.3 psi. The slow pressure
‘oscillation experienced ‘could be ‘attributed to a near equilbrium condition

of condensation and evaporation of oil at the pores of the filter.

 
 

 

172

8.2.2 Restriction at the Pump Bowl

In September of 1968 approximately one month after the start of Run
15, in addition to a restriction at the filter, a restriction developed
in the off-gas line at the exit of the coolant pump bowl. This restriction
was blown clear once by closing the pump off-gas and equalizer valves and
allowing the pump pressure to increase to 15 psig before suddenly venting
the pump to the drain tank which was at atmospheric pressure. The reactor
was shut down in November of 1968 when this restriction reappeared and a
similar restriction developed in the fuel off-gas system. |

During the shutdown, line 528 was cut approximately 3 feet downstream
of the pump bowl and a clean-out tool which was inserted toward the pump
bowl came. out covered with black, heavy grease. A brown vapor (hydro-
carbons) was collected when this section of line was heated with a torch.
The restriction was not cleared, however, until the junction of the off-
gas line and the pump bowl was heated to red heat. There was practically
no evolution of vapor from the line at that time, suggesting that the re-
striction was primarily salt or a combination of salt and hydrocarbons.

A heater was installed on the line at the exit from the pump bowl;
also a trap which was packed with stainless-steel mesh was installed in
the line approximately six feet from the pump bowl in an effort to con-
dense oil vapors at this location and thus prevent or minimize oil trans-
port downstream to the filters and valves.

Also during this shutdown all coolant off-gas valves in the coolant
drain cell were dismantled and cleaned. The valves and interconnecting
lines and filter housing were found to have a light layer of oil on the
inner surface, and approximately 10 to 20 cc of oil was cleaned from low
pockets in the interconnecting lines.

Approximately six weeks after resumption of operations, the line at
the pump bowl again showed evidence of a restriction. The heater was
energized and the restriction cleared when the temperature of the pipe
under the heater (normally at 485°C) increased to 620°C. No further off-
gas problems were encountered at this location. However, about six months
later restrictions appeared in the pressure control valve, check valve,
and the back-diffusion preventer. During the June 1969 shutdown, the fil-

ter, control valve, and nearby check valve were cleaned and reinstalled;
 

 

173

the back-diffusion preventer was removed completely. Although all four
components were coated with oil which impeded off-gas flow, it is believed
that the back-diffusion preventer was: the major restriction.

With the exception. of - the restriction in the sintered metal filter in
September 1969, no further coolant off-gas problems were encountered before
final shutdown. LL :

In summary, the restrictions in the coolant off-gas lines were pri-
marily related to oil leakage into the pump bowl. In retrospect, a filter
of an intermediate pore size (say 2-4p may have been a better choice. The
restriction at the pump “exit was probably more of a salt mist carryover
phenomenon rather than hydrocarbon related. The plugging at the coolant
pump bowl exit, although occurring less frequently, seems to be similar
to that experienced at the fuel pump which will be discussed later.

8.3 Experience with the Fuel Off-gas System

A summary of the fuel off-gas experience is given in Fig. 8.3. "The
salt circulating times and power operations are shown and the type diffi-
culties encountered are tabulated, These are discussed in the following

sections.

8.3.1 Experience with Fuel System Off-pas System Prior to Power Operation
The problems encountered with the fuel off-gas system during the pre-
critical and low-power operations (<25 kW) were somewhat similar to those
in the coolant system. ni : So
8.3.1.1 Filter and valve difficulties. After about two months of
flush salt circulation during. the precritical. testing, the fuel system
pressure control became erratic, During the shutdown: at the end of Run 1
the filter and valve were removed. The filter (pore diameter of v25u)
: appeared clean but the valve was partially plugged. The obstruction was
blown out with gas and the valve was washed with acetone, reassembled, and
‘both filter and valve reinstalled. Approximately a week after the start
of the next run, the valve again became partially plugged. This time it
was replaced with one having a larger GC, (0.077 instead of 0.022). The
smaller valve was then cut open and a black deposit of amorphous carbon

and glassy beads was found partially covering the tapered stem. The acetone

rinse from the first cleaning (Run 1) and the deposit removed from the
valve during Run 2 contained 1l- to 5-u glassy beads which proved to have
the composition of flush salt. The salt beads in the off-gas lines were
probably frozen droplets of mist produced by the stripper spray in the
fuel pump. Just as in the coolant system, it is not known whether the
mist was transported continuously or was swept out by sudden venting.
The performance of the fuel off-gas system was satisfactory for the
remainder of Run 2 and the zero-power experiments {Run 3). During the
shutdown following Run 3, larger sintered metal filters (filter area =
0.34 ft?) capable of removing particles greater than ly in diameter were
installed ahead of the pressure control valves 1n both the fuel and coolant

off-gas lines.

 

8.3.1.2 Check valve malfunctions. The check valves in the off-gas
system are spring-loaded poppet-type valves and were designed for low
pressure drops. During precritical checkout of the system when a bit of
debris caused one such valve to remain open, all the other similar valves
were removed for inspection, cleaning, and pressure drop checks before
reinstallation. Those which did not open with a forward pressure of at
least 5-in. H;0 and reclose with a forward pressure differential of ~2-in.
H20 were replaced with new valves meeting these criteria.

The next indication of a check valve malfunction was in January 1966
when a restriction developed in the check valve downstream of HCV-533. The
blockage occurred after the fuel system pressure was vented for a short
period of time through this valve to the auxiliary charcoal bed. Although
some foreign material, shown in Fig. 8.4, was found in the poppet of the
check valve, it was judged not sufficient to stop the gas flow (the plug
may have been dislodged during disassembly). The soft O-ring (which makes
the seal) and the cone of the poppet were covered with an amber varnish-
like material which was identified as a hydrocarbon.® The check valve was
not replaced and administrative control of HCV-533 was used to prevent a
backflow of gas into the fuel-pump gas space during venting of the drain
tanks. oo

In April 1966, difficulty in venting through the auxiliary charcoal

. bed was found to be due to a check valve poppet which had become lodged in
the inlet line to the bed. Apparently the poppet had vibrated loose from

a check valve at one of the drain tank lines and had been carried down-
stream during ventingioperations. The inability of the check valves to

prevent reverse flow in the exit lines of all three drain tanks implies

that any and all of these valve poppets may have vibrated loose.

8.4. Difficulties with the Fuel Off-gas System

During Power Ascension

The fuel system off-gas problems became somewhat more complex during
power ascension than those encountered earlier because of fission fragment
production in the reactor and subsequent transport of the fission gases and
"some solid decay daughters in the off-gas lines. Some of the lubricating
0il which leaked into the pump bowl (0.5 to 1.5 g/day), was polymerized to
a varnish-like substance by the high radiation field in the off-gas lines
and components. This material, amorphous carbon from the cracking process,
and solid decay daughters of the fission gases were trapped in the various
components of the off-gas system such as filters, check valves, capillaries,
valves, traps, and presumably in the charcoal beds. The difficulties ex-

perienced during this period‘ are reported by run numbers or major shutdowns.

8.4.1 Run 4
The first indication of this type of restriction occurred when the

power level was raised to 0.5 MW on January 23, 1966 Sfter only 3 MWhrs of
total integrated power. At that time, system pressure began to rise slowly
because of a restriction in the vicinity of PCV-522. Shortly after the
start of this pressure transient, the response of the drain-tank pressures
indicated an abnormal restriction at a capillary flow restrictor in line
521, the fuel-loop-to-drain-tank. equalizing line. The excess pressure in
"the fuel system was relieved by venting gas through HCV-533 to the auxili-

-ary charcoal bed until the restriction at PCV-522 was cleared by operating
"the valve several times through its full stroke. These operations also
revealed at least a partial “restriction in the line to the auxiliary char-
"coal bed, apparently at - HCV-533, The reactor was made subcritical after
© 4-1/2-hr operation at 500 kW.
“Satisfactory pressure control was maintained for about 24 hr, but the

plugging at PCV-522 recurred shortly after the reactor power was raised to

 
 

 

 

 

178

1 MW. Again, the operation of this valve through its full stroke was ef-
fective in relieving at least part of the restriction. Also on this oc--
casion, evidence of restrictions at the charcoal-bed inlets began to appear.
These restrictions were bypassed by putting the two spare charcoal-bed sec~-
tions. (2A and 2B) in service and closing the inlet valves to the two that
were restricted (lA and 1B). Within about 6 hr the inlets of beds 2A and
2B also plugged. When the previously plugged beds were checked, at least
one was found to be clear and off-gas flow was reestablished through bed

1B. |

The combination of difficulties in the off-gas system resulted in a
reactor shutdown. to correct these conditions. The restrictions in the
equalizing line (521) and the auxiliary vent line (533) were relieved by
removing the capillary (FE-521) and a check valve (CV-533, reported earlier).
The throttle valve and filter assembly, and a second valve that had been
tried briefly, were removed from line 522. A large, relatively coarse (50u)
filter and a large, open hand valve were installed at the PCV-522 location.-
This arrangement eliminated the small, easily plugged passages associated
with PCV-522, and it appeared that the filter would still remove any parti-
cles large enough to plug valve 522B, which was to be used for system pres-
sure control. The original valve, filter (pore diam. nlp), and the flow
element were subseguently examined at the High Radiation Level Examination
Laboratory (HRLEL).

Although nothing was done to clear the charcoal beds other than re-
alignment of the operating mechanisms to the valves, successive pressure
drop measurements showed that the restrictions in the beds had decreased
significantly and before the start of Run 5, flows through the beds were
back to normal. Flow measurements through the auxiliary bed showed that
the bed had also returned to normal.

Examination of FE-521 — The flow restrictor consisted of a short length
of 0.08-in. ID tubing welded into line 521 at one end and coiled to fit
inside a 3-in. ID container. The other end of the capillary was left free
in the container. When the container was cut open, the entrance region was
found to be clean, and only a small deposit was found on the container wall
near the end of the discharge region as shown in Fig. 8.5. These isotropic

particles were characterized as partly coalesced amber globules with a

refractive index of 1.520. Spectrochemical analyses indicated microgram
quantities of lithium, beryllium, and zirconium. The restrictor was not
completely plugged when examined in the hot cell.

,, Examination of PCV-522 — The stem of the control valve shown in Fig.
8.6A, was covered with an amber oil-like coating and there was an accumu~
lation of oil in the recess formed by the bellows-to-stem adapter. The
tapered flat (flow area) on the stem had small accumulations of solids;
the body was coated with a similar material and had a semisolid mass of
material on the surface near the seat port as shown in Fig. 8.6B. A gamma
scan® of this material indicated the presence of ®°Sr, *“°Ba, and '“°La.

Examination of the Filter Preceding PCV-522 — Filter-522 was a l-in.
diameter by 15-1n. long cylindrical type=316 stainless-steel sintered metal
element enclosed by a 1-1/2-in. schedule-40 pipe. The pore diameter of this
particular filter was “lu and the element thickness was 1/16 in. The filter
area was 0.34 ft*® and the flow was from the outside in, The filter assem-
bly was removed: on February 8, 1966 and examined at HRLEL on the following
day. The upper third of the element was steel gray in appearance; the
lower two-thirds had a frosty white appearance. At no place was there any
evidence of buildup or cake. A day later the frosty white areas had be-
come darker and tended toward the steel gray appearance. The index of re-
fraction of some of the material scraped from the sides of the element was,

f 140%pa, 1401

1.524 and a gamma scan® of the sample indicated the presence o
19%Ru, and **7Cs.

The filter was then reassembled for flow tests. The data indicate

a,

that for a given pressure drop the filter was passing only 5% of the corre-
sponding flow of a clean filter.® However, extrapolation of the data to

the normal MSRE off-gas flow indicates that even though 957% plugged, the
contribution of the filter (0.075 psi measured at the hot cell) to the total
pressure drop (>5 psi during Run 4) was negligible. Exposure to atmosphere
could have opened some of the pores in the filter; however, a more likely
explanation is that handling and sampling opened enough pores in the ele-

ment to produce these results.

8.4.2 Run 5

Satisfactory manual pressure control by throttling V-522B was demon-
strated during the preceding shutdown however, at the beginning of Run 5
after only 2-1/2 hours of power operation (1 MW), this valve showed evi-
dence of rapid plugging and required constant adjustment until it was in
the fully-open position five hours later. During one such adjustment,
rapid plugging of the charcoal beds occurred. At the conclusion of salt
circulation (terminated by a space-cooler motor failure), the restriction
at the inlet to charcoal bed 1B could not be cleared; therefore, the inlet
valve (HV-621) was removed for examination at the HRLEL. With the valve
out, the pressure drop across the bed was much lower but it was still higher
than for a normal unrestricted bed. An excess of helium (forward blow) was
forced through the bed and the pressure drop suddenly decreased to normal.

The cone of the inlet valve to this bed (shown in Fig. 8.7) was shiny
as though wet with an oil~like material. The small metallic chips near the
large end of the cone were a result of the sawing operation. There was
some white amorphous powder on the tapered section of the valve trim and
appeared to be adhered fairly strongly to the metal surface. A similar
material was found in the valve body. The material removed from the stem
was described as an isotropic, faintly colored material, varnishlike in
appearance with a pebbly surface. The predominant isotope in the material
was ®>*Te. The refractive index of the varnishlike material was 1.526 com-
pared with 1.50 for a distilled fraction of the lubricating oil used in the
fuel pump. ®

8.4.3 Experiments and Alterations During the March-1966 Shutdown

Off-gas samples taken while the reactor was shut down showed an in-
creasing hydrocarbon content in the gas as the reactor cell temperature was
increased, lending support to the hypothesis that there was a reservoir of
hydrocarbons in the holdup-volume portion of the off-gas line. It was not
practicable to clean the 68-ft-long, 4-in.-diam pipe, so the off-gas line
was disconnected at the fuel pump and in the vent house; large quantities
of helium were blown through the line in the forward and reverse directions

?

at velocities up to 20 times normal.®s’ Very little visible material was

collected on filters at the ends of the line, but there were fission prod- oO
ucts, and the amount doubled when the cell was heated from 50 to 80°C.
Visual observation showed that the head end of the holdup volume was clean
except for a barely perceptible dustlike film. A thermocouple was attached
to the holdup pipe near the head end for monitoring temperatures during
power operation. (When the power was subsequently raised, the temperature
indeed rose from cell air temperature of about 55°C at zero power to about
113°C at 7.5 MW. The temperature increase occurred with a time constant of
about 30 min which was not inconsistent with buildup of gaseous fission
products in the line.)
As a result of extensive laboratory tests on organic vapor traps,’
the filter-valve assembly was replaced with a particle trap and an organic
vapor trap in series and upstream of the pressure control valve (PCV-522)
whose flow coefficient was increased to 0.865. The Mark I particle trap,’
shown in Fig. 8.8 was designed to remove particulates and mist. Gas from
the fuel-pump bowl entered at the bottom of the unit through a central pipe,
reversed flow in the Yorkmesh, and passed in succession through two con-
centric cylinders of porous metal (felt metal) and a bed of inorganic fibers. Oo
The first felt metal filter was capable of stopping 96.7% of particles
greater than 0.8u and the second — 99.4% particles greater than 0.3p.
The organic vapor trap’ consisted of 13 feet of l-in. sch.-40 stainless-
steel pipe, arranged in three hairpin sections of approximately equal lengths.
The vapor trap was loaded with 1092 gm of Pittsburgh PCB charcoal and instru-—
mented with thermocouples at 5, 12, 51, 59, 105, and 113 inches, respectively,
from the bed inlet.
As a result of the experience with and examination of HV-621 and other
off-gas components, the inlet valves to the main and auxiliary charcoal beds
and V-522A were replaced with ones having larger flow coefficients.

8.4.4 Runs 6 and 7

At the start of Run 6, the pressure drops (at normal flow rate) across
the particle trap, organic vapor trap, and charcoal beds (sections 1A and
1B in parallel service) was <0,05, 0.7, and 1.6 psi respectively. The off-
gas system performance was satisfactory during the first ten days of Run 6

with the reactor operating at 1 MW or less. However, when the power was

increased to 2.5 MW, the pressure drop across ‘the charcoal beds also in-
creased. Pressurization and equalization experiments established that the
restrictions were at the inlets to the beds, probably at the packing of
steel wool above the charcoal. It was found that the pressure drop could
be reduced, usually to near the normal 1.5 psi, by blowing helium at 35
psig either forward or backward through the bed; back-blowing seemed to be
more effective. Back-blowing of the beds was done whenever the pressure
drop of two sections in parallel approached 3 psi. Later, higher pressure
drops were tolerated before back-blowing was initiated. Plugging occurred
when the power was raised during the approach to full power with section 1B
plugging more often than the others. Plugging became less frequent later,
but at the end of Run 6, it was still necessary to back-blow the beds about
once a week.

Particle Trap Performance. After approximately 10 days of operation
at the 5-MW level, the pressure drop across the particle trap started to
increase and reached 6 psi approximately a week later. When the power was
increased to 7.5 MW, the pump pressure increased to 9 psi in less than 12
hours at full power. Since the pressure drop across the organic vapor trap
was less than 0.5 psi and that across the charcoal bed was kept below 3 psi
by periodic back-blowing, the variation in pump-bowl pressure was inter-
preted as a corresponding restriction in the particle trap. About three
hours after an unscheduled power interruption, the fuel-pump pressure de-
creased to 6.5 psig and the following day it decreased to 4.3 psig. How-
ever, a few hours after the reactor power was again raised to 7.5 MW, the
pump pressure increased to 8 psig indicating a restriction in the particle
trap. At this time the helium purge to the pump shaft was decreased from
2.4 to 1.9 liters per minute in an effort to reduce the fuel-system pres-
sure. The reactor was then taken subcritical for two days. When the power
was again increased to 5 MW, the pump pressure increased from 3 psig at
zero power to 8 psig and eventually to 12 psig at full power. The pump
pressure gradually returned to the 6 to 8 psig range after approximately
a week at full power. After Run 6 was terminated by a component cooling
pump failure on May 28, 1966, the particle trap pressure drop decreased to
less than 1 psi and it remained relatively unrestricted for a month after
full-power operation was restored in Run 7. The pump pressure then gradu-

ally increased to 8.7 psig before another power reduction (MB-1 failure)
 

 

187

occurred ending Run 7. A few hours after the power reduction, the pump
pressure returned to a normal value of 3 psig and remained at this pressure
~ for approximately a month of zero-power operation before the restriction
gradually returned. oo

In summary, pump pressure increases (restrictions in the particle
traps) were usually associated with periods of power increases. Pressure
decreases were sometimes unexplained but usually were associated with power
decreases or with deliberate attempts to clear the trap such as reverse-
blowing with helium. »

Rerouting of Line 524. Helium, at a rate of 2.4 2/min, was introduced

 

through line 516 into the fuel-pump shaft annulus just below the lower shaft
oil seal. The larger part of this flow goes down the shaft into the pump
bowl thus.preventing fission gases and salt mist from entering this radi-
ation sensitive region of the pump. The smaller portion of this flow

(<0.1 2/min) goes up the shaft to prevent oil vapors from migrating to the
fuel. salt; it also aids in transporting any oil seal leakage to the oil
catch tank. The driving force for the smaller flow (line 524) is the pres-
sure difference between the fuel pump and line 522 downstream of the fuel
system pressure control valve (PCV-522). However, when PCV-522 was opened
fully (because of restrictions in the charcoal beds), line 524 had no pres-
sure differential and consequently no gas flow; therefore, it was rerouted
to enter the off-gas line at V-560A downstream of the main charcoal bed and
V-557B. V-557B was then throttled to control system pressure. On two oc-
casions in Run 6, sudden increases in pump pressure (at the completion of
salt recovery from the overflow tank) caused a gas flow reversal at the
pump shaft and gaseous activity was carried into line 524. Since this line
bypassed the charcoal bed, the gas flow had very little decay time. As a
‘consequence, gaseous activity triggered the closure of the radiation block
valve on the main off-gas line. Therefore in June of 1966, a small charcoal
bed” was added to line 524’ to hold up krypton and xenon for 2-1/2 and 30
days,: respectively. The bed consisted of 9 ft of 3-in. sched.-10 stainless-:
steel pipe loaded with 15.8 1b of Pittsburgh PCB charcoal. On at least four
occasions in the subsequent run, fission product activity was blown or dif-
fused up the pump shaft annulus. Although the activity level in the oil
catch tank and line 524 increased, there was essentially no activity re-

lease, thus proving the effectiveness of the added charcoal bed. However,

 
 

188

the last two releases from the pump bowl caused the flow element in line CC
524 to plug partially and then completely. The plug was found to be in
‘the sintered stainless-steel disc at the inlet to the matrix-type flow ele-

ment. The element was replaced with a capillary tube.

8.4.5 Experiments and Alteration During the June-September Shutdown (1966)

At the conclusion of Run 7, it was decided to flush out the residual
fuel in the overflow tank and to check the indicated level at which over-
flow occurred. Because of an insufficiency of salt in the drain tank, pres-
surizing gas from the drain tank entered the reactor and flooded the pump
bowl with salt, thus binding the pump shaft with frozen salt and pushing
salt in the gas lines at the top of the pump bowl. |

~The frozen salt was cleared from the reference bubbler line with the
use of remotely-applied external heaters; salt in the sampler line was
melted by the same technique but it ran down and refroze at the junction
with the pump bowl. This obstruction and the frozen salt in the annulus
around the pump shaft were cleared when the pump bowl was refilled and
heated to 650°C. Although some salt entered the main off-gas line as indi-
cated by a temporary rise in temperature at TE-522-2 (Fig. 8.9), pressure oO
drop measurements showed no significant difference from the clean condition.
This was attributed to the blast of compressed helium from the drain tank
that was released backward through the off-gas line, before the salt had
time to freeze completely, when the overfill triggered an automatic drain.®
Therefore the only work done on the main off-gas line (522) during this
shutdown was to replace the short, flexible "jumper" section of the line,
where the convolutions would be expected to hold some salt.

The particle trap was also removed from line 522 and sent to HRLEL for
detailed examination. An identical replacement (Mark I) was installed to
permit operation while the original was examined and a new one designed and
constructed.

Also during this shutdown, a remotely replaceable heater was designed

and installed on the inlet section of the auxiliary charcoal bed (ACB).

8.4.6 Runs 8, 9, and 10
With the resumption of operations the off-gas flowed freely, with no

fuel salt at low power. Then, two days after power operation was resumed
at 5.8 MW, a plug developed in line 522 somewhere between the pump bowl

and the junction of the overflow tank vent with the 4-in. holdup line. The
first indication was a decrease over a few hours from 107°C to 71°C at TE-
522-2, as the plug caused the off-gas to bypass through the overflow tank
(OFT). The presence of the plug was confirmed when HCV-523 was closed to
build up pressure in the OFT to return salt from the tank to the pump bowl;
pressure in the pump bowl also built up. Efforts to remove the restriction
by applying a 10-psi differential either forward or backward were unsuc-
cessful. i |

The bypassing of off-gas through the OFT aid not hinder operations
except for one specific job: recovery of salt from the overflow tank.

Salt slowly but continuously accumulated in the tank during the entire
operating life of the MSRE, and it was therefore essential to return salt
to the pump bowl two or three times a week in order to maintain proper
levels. With a plug in the off-gas line of the pump bowl, it was necessary
to greatly reduce helium flows into the pump so that the overflow tank
pressure could be increased faster than that in the pump bowl to make the
salt transfer. Through the remainder of Run 8, salt was returned (burped)
from the OFT six times, and on at least four of these occasions some fission
product activity was blown or diffused up the pump shaft annulus into the
0il collection space. This was a consequence of the reduced helium purge
down the shaft annulus and the unavoidable, sudden pressurization of the
pump bowl that occurred at times in the procedure.

After Run 8 was terminated, steps were taken to clear the plug from
the off-gas line so that the normal salt recovery procedure could be used.
Frozen salt was suspected as the cause of the plug, so the fuel loop was
flushed to reduce radiation levels, the reactor cell was opened, and speci-
ally built electrical heaters were applied to the line between the pump
bowl and the first flange. Heating alone did not clear the plug, but when,
with the line hot, 10 psi was applied backward across the plug, it blew
through. The pressure drop came down as more helium was blown through un-
til it became indistinguishable from the normal drop in a clean pipe.

In Run 9, the power operation was begun 8 hr after fuel circulation

had commenced, but TE-522~2 came up to only 66°C, indicating that the line
 

 

 

 

191

was again plugged. While tools and procedures were being devised, the re-
actor was kept in operation, but great care was taken to avoid getting fis-
sion products or salt spray up the pump shaft annulus again. This entailed
“.lowering the power to 10 KW, 24 hr before the overflow tank was to be emp-
tied, then stopping the pump 4 hr beforehand to let the salt mist settle.
During the salt transfer, the fuel pump was vented through the sampler and
auxiliary charcoal bed. After three cycles of this, the reactor was drained
and flushed again: in preparation ‘for working on the off-gas line.

This time heat was applied to the short section of line between the
second flange and the top of the 4-in. decay pipe. When heating to about
600°C did not open the line, the flexible jumper was disconnected to permit
clearing the obstruction mechanically. In the flange above the 4-in. line,
the 1/2-in. bore was completely blocked, but the weight of a chisel tool
broke through what appeared to be only a thin crust of ‘salt. ~Borescope
inspection showed that the rest of the vertical line was practically clean,
and there was only a thin layer of salt in the bottom of the horizontal run
of the 4-in. pipe. Helium was blown through the line at five times the
normal flow, and the pressure drop indicated no restriction. The flange
near the pump bowl contained a similar plug which was easily broken. A
1/4-in. flexible tool was then inserted all the way into the pump bowl to
prove that a good-sized passage existed. A new jumper line was installed
and operation was resumed, ~:~

Because obtaining samples remotely without spreading contamination
would have been most difficult, no analyses were made of the material in
the flanges. But it appeared that salt had frozen in the line, almost com-
pletely blocking it, during the overfill of July 1966. Material in the
‘off-gas stream during subsequent operation then plugged the small passages.
During the July cleanout, the heaters apparently melted the salt out of the
‘pipe, but left behind a thin bridge of salt in the cooler flanges. After
the flanges were mechanically cleaned and reassembled, this part of the
off-gas system operated satisfactorily during Run 10. =
8.4.7 MK-I Particle Trap =" =

The second particle trap served through Runs 8, 9, and 10. This unit
‘behaved in Runs 8 and '9 much as had’ the first trap; the pressure drop oc-

casionally built up to 5 to 10 psi, beginning two ‘days after power operations

 
 

 

 

192

started in Run 8. Back~blowing with helium-was effective in reducing the
pressure drop to 2 to 4 psi; however, in Run 10, after the first week of
power operation, back-blowing became ineffective. Various tactics® were
used to get fission gas to the particle trap with as little delay as possi-
ble, to see if increasing the fission product heating in the trap would
drive off the material at the restriction. After this proved to be inef-
fective and recognizing that heating caused the central inlet tube to ex-
pand farther into the Yorkmesh filter in the trap, the opposite approach
was used. Eight hours of delay was obtained by routing the gas through an
equalizing line to the empty drain tank, through the tank and salt fill
lines to the other tank where it bubbled through several inches of salt
heel, then out through the drain-tank vent line to the particle trap. The
pressure drop across the trap was 16 psi when the gas was first rerouted,
but within a few hours it was below 2 psi. When the original route was
again tried, the restriction began to build up almost immediately} there-
fore, . the delayed route was used until the end of Run 10 which was termi-
nated for in-cell repairs and also because a newly constructed particle
trap (Mark II) based on the Hot Cell examination of the first trap was °
ready for installation. . : Co

Examination of MK-I Particle Trap.® Flow tests on the first trap (in
service from April through July of 1966) indicated that (1) the pressure:
drop after service was about 20 times the "clean" pressure drop. Assuming
orifice type flow, this would represent a reduction in flow area of about
80%. (2) The bulk of the pressure drop occurred in the Yorkmesh and Felt-
metal sections of the filter. The Fiberfrax section was essentially clean.

The area of the Yorkmesh which had been immediately below the inlet.
pipe was covered with a blue-gray to black mat which had completely filled
the space between the wires of the mesh (Fig. 8.10). The shape.of the mat
corresponded to the bottom of the inlet pipe, and it is likely that this
material was the major restriction to gas flow while in service.

Since the inlet pipe temperature probably increased several hundred -
degrees during power operation of the reactor, it is believed that this
restriction behaved similar to a thermal valve. This could account for the
unexpected increase in pressure drop while at power and the decrease in .-
pressure drop when the power was reduced or when the off-gas was delayed

via the drain tank.

A radiation survey made around the outside surface of the lower section
of the trap gave readings ranging from 6900 to 8000 R/hr. The probe indi-
cated 11,400 R/hr when inserted into the position formerly occupied by the
inlet pipe. The radiation level dropped off to 4100 R/hr at the bottom of
the trap. The bottom of the inlet pipe had a deposit of blackish material
which corresponded to that in the Yorkmesh. The inside of the inlet pipe
at the upper end of the bellows appeared clean and free of deposit. The
exterior of the bellows had some of the light-yellow powdery material on
a background of dark brown.

When the Yorkmesh was removed, it was found that the surface of the
outer wires of the mesh bundle was covered with a thin layer of amber-
colored organic material. - Much of this material evaporated from the heat
of the floodlamp used to make the photographs. As the bundle was unrolled,
the color of the film on the wire changed from amber to brown to black near
the center. The black material was thicker than the wire by a factor of 2
or 3. This material was brittle, as was the wire, and much of it came
loose as the wire was flexed. Samples of this material, designated Nos.
5B and 6 (Fig. 8.8) were taken for examination and chemical analysis. Met-
allographic examination of a piece of the wire covered with the black ma-
terial showed that the wire was heavily carburized with a continuous net-
work of carbide in the grain boundaries. There was no evidence of melting
of the wire; however, the grain growth and other changes indicated oper-
ating temperatures of at least 650°C. The nonmetallic deposit observed on
the wire mesh was apparently of a carbonaceous nature and appeared to have
been deposited in layers. These "growth rings" were probably the result
of off-gas temperature, reactor power, and gas flow-rate changes.

The perforated plate of the coarse filter section and the lower flange
of the filter assembly were covered with a stratified scale (view A-A,

Fig. 8.8). The colors varied from a very light yellow to orange. One
stratum in the lower flange area appeared gray, almost black. A sample

(No. 9) was taken of the light-colored material, including some of the
black material. The perforated plate of the fine filter section was covered
with a thin, dark-brown coating, which seemed to be evenly distributed over
the surface of the plate. The inner surface of the outer wall of the trap

was covered with a light-amber coating, which was also evenly distributed. -
 

 

 

 

195

It is believed that these coatings were deposited by condensation and sput-
tering of the oil from the adjacent filter and that the dark brown color
indicates that the porous metal screen had operated at a much higher tem—
perature than had the ‘outer.wall (during operation the trap was immersed

in a tank of water for cooling by natural convection). The lower surface
of the upper flange (view B-B, Fig. 8.8) contained a deposit which had the
appearance of organic residue. The deposit was amber colored, and the frac-
‘tured edge (Fig. 8.11) gave the impression that the material was brittle.
There is as yet no explanation for formation of this deposit or how it came
to be formed in this particular location, The radiation level on the out-
side of this section of the filter was 200 to 360 R/hr.

The material at the entrance of the Fiberfrax section showed an oil-
like discoloration, but there was no evidence of any significant accumula-
tion of material. Comparison of the weights of the different layers with
the weights of the material originally loaded indicated changes of less
than 0.2 g. An interesting observation relates to the very low radioac-
tivity level of the Fiberfrax at the entrance section which is separated
only by the Feltmetal filter from an area containing material with activity
levels of thousands of R/hr. The only detectable activity (above the exami-
nation cell background of 4.2 ‘R/hr) was, at the discharge end of the Fiber-
frax section. It is probable that this activity resulted from back-blowing
the trap or from pressure transients which could have carried gaseous decay
products from the vapor trap back upstream and into the particle trap.
-Even so, the activity level was only 1.8 R/hr above background.
| Analytical Resulte.® A total of four samples from three different lo-
cations (Fig. 8.8) were subjected to a variety of analytical tests. The

samples were identified as follows:

3A Le ‘Coarse section of porous metal filter

For sections of sample 3A it was found that about the same weight loss
(0.2% of sample weight) resulted from heating to 600°C in helium as from
dipping in a trichlorethylene bath. The material removed by heating was

cold trapped and found to be effectively decontaminated; however, the tri-
chlorethylene wash was contaminated with fission products.

Samples 5B and 9 were compared for low-temperature volatiles; at 150°C,
No. 9 lost 5% and No. 5B lost none. When raised to 600°C, the weight losses
were 35% for sample 5B and 327 for sample 9. Analysis of the carbon content
gave none for sample 9 and 97 for sample 58, This indicates that sample 9
had not reached as high a temperature as had sample 5B.

The mass spectrographic analysis of sample 6 indicated that there was
a very high fraction of fission products. These are estimated to be 20
wt Z Ba, 15 wt % Sr, and 0.2 wt Z Y. In the same analysis the salt con-
stituents Be and Zr were estimated to be 0.01 and 0.05 wt Z respectively.

In addition the material in samples 5B and 6 contained small quanti-
ties of Cr, Fe, and Ni, while sample 9 did not. The reliability of these
values was compromised by difficulties caused by the presence of organics

and small sections of wire in the sample.

 

‘The gamma-ray spectrographic work indicated the presence of the fol-
lowing isotopes: **7Cs, °°Sr, !°%Ru or *°°Ru, '*°PAg, °°Nb, and *“°La.

‘All three samples were chemically analyzed for Be, and the level was
below the detectable limit of 0.17%. Attempts to analyze for Zr were com—
plicated by the presence of large quantities of Sr.

The fraction of soluble hydrocarbons was determined using CS:, and
the values were 5B, 60%; 6, 73%; and 9, 80%. The extract solutions from
samples 5B and 6 were allowed to evaporate, and a few milligrams of the
residue was mounted between salt crystals for infrared analysis. The sam—
ples were identical and were characteristic of long-chain hydrocarbons.
There was no evidence of any functional groups other than those involving
carbon and hydrogen. Nor was there any evidence suggesting double or triple
bonds. There was an indication of a possible mild cross-linkage. It is
likely that there is more cross-linkage of the organic in the gas stream
than appeared in these samples, and the low indication could be due to the
insolubility of the cross-linked ‘organic and the high operating temperatures
of the wire mesh, which would cause breakdown of the organic into elemental

carbon and volatiles.

8.4.8 MK-II Particle Trap
As a result of the operating experience with and detailed’ examination

of the first particle trap, the MK-II trap,® (shown in Fig. 8.12) was de-
signed with the following features:

1. The trap housing was increased from 4 to 6-in. ID, resulting in
an increase in cross-sectional area of 2257 in both the Yorkmesh and Fiber-
frax sections.

2. The unit was in effect turned upside down so that the Yorkmesh
section is at the top of the unit and the Fiberfrax section is at the bot-
tom. This change permits heating of the Yorkmesh section (using beta decay
heat and lowering the water level) while still maintaining cooling on the
. other two sections.

3. The disposition of the Yorkmesh was modified to provide increased
frontal area in the direction normal to the flow.

4. Since the first trap had shown very little loading in.the fine
Feltmetal section, only the coarse Feltmetal was used.

5. The total filter area was increased from 22 in? for the original
to 288 in? for the new trap.

6. The depth of the Fiberfrax was reduced by 50%.

7. The pressure drop at 15 2/m was less than 1 in. H;0 and the trap

.
?

efficiency was 99.9% for particles greater than 0.8u.

8.4.9 Organic Vapor Trap

It was expected that accumulation of organic material in the charcoal
trap immediately downstream of the particle trap would result in progressive
poisoning along the length of the trap. Such poisoning would shift the lo-
cation of maximum fission product adsorption and produce a shift in the
temperature profile of the trap. Except for the upward shift due to in-
creased power level, the basic shape of the temperature profile did not
change, indicating that no significant poisoning by organics occurred.

Since the pressure control valve (PCV-522) was operated in the fully-
“opened position and it appeared that nothing would be lost by eliminating
the charcoal. trap, both were removed to make room for two new MK-II parti-
cle traps which were installed in parallel in January 1967.

8.4.10 Charcoal Bed Performance

After the removal of the check valve poppet in April 1966, venting
through the auxiliary charcoal bed was uneventful through the approach to
power operation. However, an intermittent restriction was noted early in
July. During the fill and drain after the July 17 shutdown, the restric-
tion became continuous and more . severe and was not amenable to back-blowing.
A remotely placeable assembly of electric heaters was designed and placed
around the junction of the inlet pipe and steel wool section of the auxili-
ary charcoal -bed. In the brief shutdown between Runs 8 and 9 the level in
the pit was lowered below the bed inlets and the heater was energized.
Some: improvement was observed when the heater temperature reached 385°C.
After the temperature was raised to 670°C and then cooled, the pressure
drop was downby a factor of 5, to a satisfactory level. The auxiliary bed
operated relatively trouble-free until it became partially restricted in
March 1969 and again about two months later. Back-blowing cleared the bed
in March; a forward-blow in May was adequate but not as effective. No fur-
ther operational problems with the auxiliary bed were reported.

Sections 1A and 1B of the main charcoal bed had been used almost ex-
clusively during earlier runs, and they were on-line when Run 8 started.
The pressure drop at the inlet of these sections began to increase a few
hours after the power was raised. and when the pressure drop reached 7 psi,
sections 2A and 2B were also brought on line. Since back-blowing had be-
come progressively less effective and in light of the success with heaters
on the inlet of the auxiliary bed, an attempt was made to clear the re-
striction in section 1B by heating the inlet with a torch (electric heaters
to fit this bed were not then available). Although the bed temperature
reached 465°C, there was no improvement and all four sections of the main
bed were operated in parallel for Run 9. After this run, electric heaters
were installed on the inlets of sections 1A and 1B. Heating to 400°C for

8 hours brought the pressure drop back to the normal range for clean beds.
201

8.5 Subsequent Operating Experience with Fuel Off-gas System

With the major part of the MSRE operating time yet to come, the off-gas
problems during this period while still present were somewhat ameliorated by
more efficient particle traps and methods of clearing these restrictions.
Some new restrictions ‘appeared but basically they were similar to those
already described. Remote maintenance methods were used to cope with some

of these.

8. 35. 1 Particle Trap
The MK-IT trap (Unit No. 1) was in service from January 1967 to May

of 1969 with no noticeable restriction; however, during the first week in
May, the pressure drop across the trap increased to 0.4 psi. A week later
when this restriction increased to 0.75 psi, the reserve unit, which had
been valved out up to this time, was put in parallel service. This lowered
the pressure drop to 0.1 psi or less. Also temperatures in the trap re-
flecting fission-gas heating indicated that nearly all of the gas was flow-
ing through the fresh bed. In October 1969, pressure drop measurements on
the off-gas system indicated a restriction of 0.3 psi across trap No. 2;
however, cycling the inlet valve, V-522C, between its closed and open po-
sitions cleared the restriction; this indicated a restriction in the valve
rather than the trap. Three days later the restriction reappeared and was
cleared by the same method. No further problems in this area were en-

countered.

8.5.2 Introduction of Oxygen into Fuel Drain Tank No. 1

In the event of a salt spill into the reactor cell, provisions had
‘been made to vent the reactor cell to the auxiliary charcoal bed through
-a line equipped with two block valves. In January 1967, these valves,
© V-571 A and B, were inadvertently opened while the reactor cell was being
- pressure~tested prior to Run 11. Reactor cell air entered the auxiliary
charcoal: bed which at the time was being used to vent the empty but hot
reactor via FD-1. The slow leakage. of cell air into the ACB resulted in
an increase in fuel system pressure and was incorrectly diagnosed as plug-
ging in the auxiliary charcoal bed. To clear the bed, it was pressurized
to 50 psig with helium and released into FD-1 (V-571A was discovered to be
about 1/2 turn open during the back-blowing operation).

 
 

 

 

202

It was estimated that a maximum of 1.25 g-moles of Oz; could have been
back-blown into FD-1 which contained approximately 2 cu ft of molten fuel

salt. ®?

It is believed that the oxygen was later purged out of the drain
tank without appreciable mixing with the fuel system piping.
Subsequently, line 571 which joined the two systems was cut and both

ends were cap-welded.

8.5.3 Charcoal Beds

The restrictions at the inlet sections of the main charcoal bed con-
tinued to exhibit chronic plugging throughout the remainder of MSRE power
operations. Sections 1A and 1B began to plug slowly after the two weeks of
power operation in Run 11. After 4 weeks of operation the pressure drop
increased from 2.5 to 5 psi and reached 7 psi two months after the start of

the run. When sections 2A and 2B were ‘put in service, the pressure drop in-

creased from 2.6 to 9 psi in only ten days. Sections 2A and 2B were cleared

by forward-blowing with helium and sections 1A and 1B were cleared with the
previously installed heaters. These operations did not require a reduction
in reactor power but only a temporary lowering of the water :level in -the
charcoal ‘bed pit to allow the heaters to function. Approximately one month
later this operation had to be repeated.

Owing to the success of the heaters on the auxiliary bed and sections.
1A and 1B of the main bed, similar heaters were installed at the inlets of
sections .2A and 2B during the shutdown between Runs 11 and 12.

Approximately one month after the start of Run 12, it was again neces-
sary to clear all four sections. |

During MSRE.startup, injections of ®®Kr indicated that the charcoal
bed hold-up time was 5-1/2 days for krypton with two sections in parallel
service; the equivalent xenon hold-up time was calculated to be 88 days.
Thermocouples are located at the entrance regions of the 1~1/2—, 3-, and
6-inch diameter sections of the charcoal. beds. These sections contain 4.75,
27.4 and 67.85 percent, respectively, of the total charcoal in the beds.

On the basis of a.5.5 day hold-up time for krypton, the lag in temperature
response to fission gas adsorption between the 1-1/2— and 3~inch diameter
sections should be 6.3 hours (4.75% of 5.5 days) when two beds are in ser-

vice and 3.1 hours when one bed is in service. During full-power operation

-
 

 

 

 

203

on September 15, 1967, the temperature response interval for beds 1A and

1B was 11-1/2 hours. During a similar startup on September 21, 1967, the
response interval was 9-1/2 hours for bed 1A and 11-1/2 hours for bed 1B
indicating that bed 1B had developed more of a restriction than bed 1A.
During the startup of November 25, 1967 with beds 2A and 2B in service, the
response interval was 8-1/2 hours for bed 24 and no response in bed 2B in-
dicating an appreciable restriction in bed 2B. Beds 2A and 2B were then
valved off and bed 1A was put An service; the temperature response interval
was 6-1/2 hours. Bed 1A remained in service for the remainder of Run 14
(130 days) with the exception of a 10-day period in the middle of February
" when two sections were put in service to achieve the low fuel-pump pressure
required for a reactivity test. The maximum pressure drop across the single
section during Run 14 was 4.9 psi. No discernible increase in effluent
activity was detected by the radiation monitors downstrean of the charcoal
trap during the single bed test.

No plugging in the bed was experienced during the precritical and low
power (<25 kW) operation using 23% fuel (Runs 15 and 16). However, during
the next runs, gradual plugging recurred after the first 12 days of power
operation (5 MW). The: electric heaters, previously installed on the inlet
section, were used to clear the beds, although two of the three heater ele-
ments installed on sections. lA and 1B and one element on 2B failed. This
procedure along with a back-blow at the end of the 8-hour heating cycle was
required to clear the beds approximately three months later. Unfortunately,
during the valving operations involved, the stem or stem extension on the
inlet valve to section 2A broke with the valve in the closed position. Re-
pairs were not attempted because of the high radiation level at the valve
and the sufficiency of the other three sections. |
During portions of the ‘next run (19) argon was substituted as a cover

gas to study its effect on core void fraction and reactivity changes. No
unusual off-gas problems associated with argon were manifest other than
interpretation of flow and pressure drops through the system during the
‘several switchovers from one gas ‘to the other. A barely perceptible in-
crease - in the effluent stack iodine indicator (attributed to neutron acti-
vation of argon in the reactor) was noticed. During this run, it was neces-

sary to clear the charcoal beds twice, using the inlet heater and a

 
 

 

204

forward-blow with helium at 25 psig. No further problems were encountered
with the bed during the last run.

8.5.4 Restriction at the Pump Bowl

 

The restriction in the off-gas line at the pump bowl reappeared in
November 1967, one year since the line was last cleared with a flexible
reamer. The restriction became noticeable approximately 2-1/2 days after
the reactor power was reduced to 10 kW to repair the sampler-enricher.
During this period the operational and maintenance valves were open, and
a 0.6-liter/min helium purge was maintained down the sampler tube to the
pump bowl to prevent contamination of the sampler by fission gases. The
restriction was evidenced by an increase (0.5 psig) in the fuel-pump bowl
pressure when the overflow tank vent valve was closed during a routine
return of salt from the overflow tank to the pump bowl. After the sampler
was repaired, the restriction was relieved by pressurizing the pump bowl to
6.0 psig and suddenly venting the gas into a drain tank which was at 3 psig.
The pressure drop then appeared notmal (<0.1l psi), but after three more
days of low-power operation, an abnormal pressure rise (0.2 psi) was again
observed when salt was being returned from the overflow tank. Repetition
of the mild blow-through to the drain tank had little or no effect this
time. The line was not completely blocked, however, and full-power opera-
tion was resumed. At first, temperatures on the overflow tank and the off-
gas line (responding to fission product heating) clearly indicated that
"there was enough pressure drop at the pump-bowl outlet to cause much of the
off-gas to bubble through the overflow tank and out its vent line. Then,
after 15 hr at full power, the bypass flow stopped, indicating that the re-
striction had decreased significantly; it remained below the limits of de-
tection throughout the next nine weeks while the reactor was operating at
7.2 Md or 5 MW. After two days at 10 kW, the pressure drop again became
detectable and continued to increase over the next six days at very low
power. When power operation was resumed at 5 MW, temperatures indicated
that there was again bypass flow through the overflow tank. The restric-
tion increased during two weeks of operation at 5 MW, but the line never
became completely plugged. Four days after the resumption of full-power

operation in February 1968 while the overflow .tank was being emptied, the
205 -

restriction partially blew out, bringing the pressure drop again below the
limit of detection. The pressure drop remained just at or below the limit
until the March-1968 shutdown. for fuel processing.

~The behavior was quite unlike the plugging that occurred earlier in
the same section of line as a result of the overfill with flush salt, main-
ly in that it never completely plugged and there was a suggestion of some
effect of power level.

After the fuel was drained, the flexible section of off-gas line was
removed, and a felxible tool was -run through the 28-in. of line back to the
pump bowl. The tools, a 1/4~in. cable with a diamond drill tip, encountered
some resistance at first and came out with a considerable amount of solids .
on it. Although the flexible jumper and the line downstream were not re-
stricted, the jumper line along with the flexible reaming tools were sent
to the High-Radiation-Level-Examination Laboratory for cut-up and exami-
nation. Co [Eo |
The replacement jumper line was equipped with four thermocouples to
provide more information during power operation. A slender basket contain-
ing devices of metal and graphite to collect material from the off-gas
~ stream was suspended in the entrance of the 4-in, off-gas hold-up pipe.

The restriction at the pump bowl reappeared after approximately one
month of operation with the new fuel in September 1968. The restriction
was blown.clear once during pressure~drop measurements, but reappeared a
week later and could not be dislodged by back-blowing helium from the drain
tank to the pump bowl. The pressure drop across the restriction had in-
creased to 4 psi by the last week in November 1968, when the fuel and cool-

ant systems were drained to clean out the off-gas lines of both systems and

 

‘also to mix the fuel before the start of full-power operation.

~The flange at the fuel-pump bowl was again disconnected, and a flexi-
ble cable assembly, connected to a filter and a vacuum pump, was used to
ream out the off-gas line to the fuel pump and also to collect a sample of
the restricting material. Only a very small amount of blackish dust was
_ recovered on the filter paper and from the flexible tubing. The flange
was reconnected and the reactor was refilled; however, after about three
weeks of operation, the restriction reappeared in mid-January and gradually

increased to a AP of 5.5 psi. Because the rapid recurrence of the restriction
 

 

 

 

206

at the pump-bowl exit threatened to become a serious nuisance, a compact
2-kW heater unit was designed for installation on this line at the first
opportunity; however, in the last week in February during a routine trans-
fer of fuel from the overflow tank to the fuel pump, the restriction was
blown clear, resulting in a complete transfer of fuel from the overflow
tank to the pump bowl. The pressure drop in this section of line was then
below the limit of detection (about 0.1 psi).

On five other occasions in the next 9 weeks the pressure drop became
noticeable, but each time it blew out when the overflow tank was burped.

On May 1 it reappeared and remained detectable through the June-1969 shut-
down. The restriction caused most of the pump-bowl purge gas flow to bub-
ble through the overflow tank except when the overflow tank was being pres-
surized to push accumulated salt back to the pump bowl. As a consequence,
on May 25, the off-gas line from the overflow tank became almost completely
plugged and it became necessary to turn off the overflow tank bubbler flow
most of the time. Thereafter all the pump purge gas was forced out through
the off-gas line from the pump bowl. This situation caused some inconveni-
ence during the burping operation, but by reducing purge flow to the pump
bowl at these times, salt could be transferred back to the fuel pump with-
- out exceeding 15 psig in the pump bowl.

During the June shutdown, the 2-kW heater that had been built earlier
was installed remotely on the pipe as near to the pump as possible and con-
nected to spare power and thermocouple leads in the reactor cell. The pump-
tank furnace heaters and the new heater were turned up to bring the section
of off-gas line to near 650°C, then gas pressure was applied to blow the
restricting material back toward the pump bowl. The heater was subsequent-
ly turned off but left connected so that it could be used again without re-
opening the reactor cell.

The set of specimens exposed in the off-gas hold-up volume since July
1968 was also removed during the June shutdown.

Although the restriction did not reappear during Run 19, the pressure
modifier and recorder which was installed on the fuel-pump pressure trans-
mitter to detect high frequency pressure noise in the reactor core indi-

cated that a restriction at the pump exit was again in its formative stage.”
 

207

The restriction did not become evident (by previous standards) until ap-
proximately two weeks after the fuel fill of Run 20. In the three days
before final reactor shutdown, the restriction increased from 1.3 to 2.2
psi as measured with the procedure for salt recovery from the overflow tank.
Because of the proximity of the reactor shutdown date and the desirability
of not interrupting the experiment in progress, the heater which had previ-
ously been installed and successfully used to clear a similar restriction,
was not used,

Examination of the 522 Jumper Line Removed March 1968.'* An 8-mg sam-

 

ple of what appeared to be soot was collected from the upstream flange of

~ the flexible jumper line; a 15-mg sample of a similar material was collected

from the downstream flange. The 8-mg sample indicated about 80 R/hr and the
15-mg sample indicated about 200 R/hr at contact." Each of the flanges and
the convolutions of the flexible hose appeared to have remaining on them a
thin dull-black film. A one-inch section cut from the upstream end of the
jumper line indicated 150 R/hr; a similar section from the downstream end
indicated 350 R/hr. |

The reaming tools used. in clearing the restriction at the pump bowl

_ were covered with ‘blackish, pasty, granular material which was identified

by X-ray as fuel salt particles. The relatively high values of lithium
and beryllium found in this sample may indicate pickup of some residual
LiFz;-BeF; flush salt which had entered the off-gas line as a result of the
pump overfill in 1966. oo

Electron photomicrographs of the upstream dust showed. relatively solid
particles of lu surrounded by a material of lighter and different structure
which appeared to be. amorphous carbon. Chemical analyses of the dust sam-
ples showed 12 to 16% carbon, 28 to 54% fuel salt; and 4% structural metals.
Based on activity data, fission products could have amounted to 2 to 3% of
the sample weight. The unaccountability of the remainder is attributable
to the small amount of sample available.

From the dust collected from line 522 onto a filter during the December-

12 yere reached: (1) the isotopes

1968 shutdown, the following conclusions
assy 140g, 144ce, and ®3Zr were transported only as salt constituents;

(2) the isotopes ®°Sr, °'Y, and **7’Cs, which have noble gas precursors, were

 
pr

 

208

present in significantly greater proportions consistent with a mode of
transport other than salt particles; (3) the isotopes ®*Nb, °°Mo, *°°Ru,
and '?*DTe were present in even greater proportions, indicating that they
were transported more vigorously than fuel salt.

A more complete discussion of these findings and the results of exami-
nation of the sample specimens removed from the 4-in. hold-up volume will
be covered in a report to be issued by Compere and Bohlmann entitled "Fis-
sion Product Behavior in the MSRE During ?*®Uranium Operation" (ORNL-TM-
2753).

8.5.5 Other Restrictions in Line 522

On five occasions during Runs 17 and 18, complete flow blockage oc-
curred in the main off-gas line somewhere between the 4-in.-diam hold-up
pipe and the junction of Line 522 and the auxiliary charcoal bed line, 533.
Although the plug could have occurred at the inlet port of V-5224, it is
unlikely that the plug formed in the valve itself because manipulating the
valve stem to its full travel in both directions did not break the plug
loose. In each case the fuel system pressure was vented for short periods oO
of time through the equalizer and drain tank vent lines to the auxiliary
charcoal bed until line 522 was unplugged by back-flowing helium from line
571, through lines 561, 533, and 522 to the hold-up volume. It seems that
each plug became successively more difficult to dislodge. To dislodge the
last plug, it was necessary to vent the fuel system to 2 psig, pressurize
line 533 to 60 psig, and quickly open V-522A. The last effort apparently

restored the line to near its original condition because plugging at this

location had not recurred at the end of reactor operations. Because of the

remoteness and inaccessiblity of this line, no further effort was made to

locate the exact position or characterize the nature of the plug.

8.5.6 Restriction in the Overflow Tank Exit Line

The fuel pump was provided with an overflow pipe. (shown in Fig. 8. .9)
and a catch tank (5.4 ft®) to prevent salt from becoming high enough to al-
low it to enter the gas and lubricating passages of the pump as a result
of unusually high gas entrainment in the circulating salt or possibly as a
result of a high-temperature excursion while operating. The overflow pipe

from the pump dips to within less than 1/2-in. of the bottom and into a
 

 

209

1/2-in.-deep dimple pressed in the lower tank head to permit more complete
retrieval of its contents. During operations, salt spray and/or bubbles
slowly spilled into the overflow tank (OFT); the salt was periodically re-
turned to the pump bowl by closing the OFT gas discharge valve and allowing
helium from the bubble-type level indicators to build up the required pres-
sure (v3.5 psi > pump bowl pressure) to force the salt back to the pump bowl.
When the OFT discharge is opened, the salt remaining in the tank and that
remaining in the pipe is sufficient to provide a seal at the bottom of the
tank and thus prevent fission product gases from entering the overflow tank.
However, when the main off-gas line, 522, became restricted near the pump
bowl, practically all of the pump purge gas and gaseous fission products
were bubbled through the salt heel in the OFT and out through line 523 to
join the main off-gas line downstream of TE-522-2. From TE-522-2 data and
pressure measurements during salt recovery. operations, it was estimated

that fission product gases were first diverted through the OFT on October 15,
1966. Since the fuel-pump overfill on July 24, 1966, it is estimated that

‘most -of the fuel-pump gases were forced through the overflow tank for ap-

proximately 28 days in 1966, 6 days in 1967, 76 days in 1968, and 68 days
in 1969, before the overflow tank gas exit line (523) became plugged on

May 25. Thereafter, all of the pump purge gas was forced out through the
restriction in the off-gas line at the exit of the pump bowl. This situ-

ation caused some inconvenience during the salt recovery operation, but by

‘reducing purge flow to the pump at these times, the operation could be done

without exceeding 15 psig in the pump bowl.

During the shutdown in June 1969, when the overflow .tank vent line was
scanned with the remote gamma spectrometer, an unusually strong source was
observed at the air-operated valve (HCV-523), about 33 ft downstream from
the overflow tank. Flanges were opened and pressure observations showed
that the restriction was in the flanged section containing both the air-
operated valve and a hand valve. This section was removed to a hot cell
where polymerized hydrocarbons and fission products were found to be block-
ing the hand valve inlet port. A replacement section containing an air-

operated valve but no hand valve was installed. Although the restriction

~ at the exit of the pump bowl reappeared during the last week of MSRE opera-

tion, the OFT discharge line functioned normally.

8.5.7 Restrictions at Exits of Drain Tanks

During the reactor drain in June of 1969, pressure measurements indi-
cated that a restriction had developed in the gas line somewhere between
Fuel Drain Tank No. 2 (FD-2) and the junction of the inlet line (574) and
the exit line (575). The first half of the drain appeared normal at a drain
rate of v2 cu ft of salt per minute after which it tapered off to ~0.25 cu
ft per minute when the trapped gas in the drain tank balanced the salt in
the fuel system. Two and a half hours were required for the drain as op-
posed to a normal drain time of less than 40 minutes when drained into one
tank. The restriction was later cleared by heating the tank to 680°C and
applying a pressure differential of 60 psig across the plug via line 561.

A similar but lesser restriction in the gas line at the other fuel drain
tank was partially cleared during the fuel system pressure test in August
1969 by heating the tank to 680°C and flowing helium from FD-2 (at 50 psig)
to FD-1 (at 2 psig).

Restrictions in these lines were most probably deposited (but not to
the point of detection) during December of 1966 and January of 1967 when
the reactor off-gas was routed to FD-1, through FV-106 and FV-105, through
the salt heel in FD-2, and out through line 575 (Sect. 5.6.1). Fission gas
decay heating, during this time, was appreciable in the drain tanks and re-
quired downward adjustments to the drain tank heaters. The offegas flow
through the drain tanks was reversed after the first week in an effort to
minimize plugging. So | ,

The off-gas flow was again routed through drain tank No. 2 gas lines
for a day when line 522 plugged in May of 1969.

In October of 1969 during a pressure release test when the fuel-pump
gas was released into FD-1, it was discovered that the gas line was again
restricted near the drain tank. Two attempts were made to clear this line
by back~blowing helium, first at 30 psig and then at 50 psig, from line 561
through HCV-573 and into FD-1. Although only marginal improvement was ob-
" tained, the gas flow through this line was judged adequate for any emer-
gency drain situation. Bh )

During the subsequent drain in November 1969, approximately 4300 1b of
salt drained into FD-1 and 5100 lbs drained into FD-2 indicating that a
slight restriction existed in the exit gas line of FD-1. During the
211

December drain, the exit gas valve from FD-2 was closed during part of the.
drain to compensate for the partial restriction in FD-1 gas line; however,
overcompensation resulted and 5400 lbs drained into FD-1 and 4100 1bs

drained into FD-2. The drain times for both drains were less than 20 min-

utes which is normal for a drain when both tanks are used.

8.5.8 Restrictions at the 0ff-pas Sampler

A system to permit - the analysis of the reactor off-gas stream was in-
stalled downstream of the particle trap as shown in Fig. 8.2. The sampler
contained two thermal-conductivity cells, a copper oxide converter, and two
molecular sieves, one operating at liquid nitrogen temperature and the other
at room temperature.® Since the sampler was an integral part of primary
containment during sampling operations, and since some components of the
sampler did not meet the requirements of primary containment, solenoid
block valves were installed in the inlet and outlet lines which connect.
the sampler to the reactor system. Two fail-closed valves in series were
installed in each line and were instrumented to close on high sampler ac--
tivity, high reactor cell pressure, and high fuel~pump pressure.

Although located downstream of the particle trap, the inlet line to
the off-gas sampler periodically developed a restriction in the vicinity
of the safety block valves, The block valves have 3/32-in.-diam ports and
the inlet piping is 0.083 in ID autoclave. tubing. The restriction was suc-
cessfully cleared each time by back-blowing with helium. As encountered
in other parts of the off-gas system, successively higher pressures were
required to clear the restriction each time. During the latter part of
Run 18, the inlet block valves would not shut off tightly and were replaced
in July of 1969. Visual inspection of the faulty inlet valves did not re-
veal the reason for the leaking valves nor the nature of the restriction
~ (the restriction had been blown clear before the valves were -replaced).
During the August startup, it was again necessary to blow out the restrie-

tion at the inlet to the sampler.

8.6 Discussion and Conclusions

The periodic plugging in the coolant system off-gas filter and also
in the fuel system filter during the precritical and low-power (<25 kW)
operation can be attributed primarily to the accumulation of oil in the
0.7 to lu diameter pores of the sintered metal filters (2 to 4p pores might
have been a better choice). However, subsequent filters in the fuel system

were constructed of felt metal (Huyck Nos. FM-225 and FM-204) which was not
only efficient at stopping solid fission products but also was apparently
immune to plugging by hydrocarbons. Virtually all of the solid decay daugh~
‘ters were stopped by the Yorkmesh and filter before reaching the Fiberfrax
section of the particle trap.

0il vapor in the off-gas stream condensed on various parts of the off-
gas system components and apparently enhanced the adsorption or trapping of
particulate matter, particularly on the Yorkmesh portion of the particle
trap.

The fact that such large amounts of solid decay daughters were trapped
in the particle trap indicates that most of these solids tend to remain in
the gas phase until trapped onto a surface wetted by hydrocarbons. It is
not clear whether the solid decay daughters agglomerate in the hold-up vol-
ume and if so whether they agglomerate with others of their own species,
with other species, with hydrocarbons, or possibly combine chemically to
form both volatile and non-volatile compounds. A large fraction of the
noble gas fission products decay in the 4-inch-diameter hold-up volume and
their decay daughters apparently plate out or are adsorbed onto the first
flow channel restriction where the gas flow changes direction and/or is
close to a relatively cold surface such as valves and flow restrictors.

The high hydrocarbon content (>60%) of the material collected on the
Yorkmesh is inconsistent with the high temperature (v650°C) in this region
during power operation; hydrocarbons are vaporized and cracked at this tem-
perature. One must assume, then, that the hydrocarbons were collected
sometime after power operation had ceased and after the fission product de-
cay heat became negligible. The growth rings on the Yorkmesh were probably

caused by alternate periods of power and zero-power operation.
 

 

213

Since spectrographic analysis did not show any of the alkali metals,
cesium or rubidium, on the Yorkmesh, they were apparently boiled off also
by fission product decay heating in this region. If this be the case, ap-
preciable quantities of these materials would be expected to be collected
in the charcoal beds. On the other hand, large quantities of barium and
strontium were reported on the Yorkmesh; this would argue for effective
trapping of their precursors, cesium and ribidium. However, to be trapped
on Yorkmesh at 650°C, the. alkali metals would necessarily have to be chemi-
cally combined (as halides for instance) rather than in the elemental form,
otherwise they would boil off and be carried downstream.

Although none of the solid decay daughters in the 4-in.-diam pipe got
past the particle trap, another batch (though somewhat smaller number) of
solid decay daughters are born (and presumably remain in the gas phase) in
the larger hold-up volume ahead of the main charcoal beds. These fission
products along with hydrocarbons are probably the source of the plugging
experienced at the entrance region of the beds.

After examination of the MK-I particle trap, it is understandable why
the entrance region of the charcoal beds plugged periodically; the entrance
pipe (1/4-in. sched-40) enters the bed normal to the section where the
stainless steel wool is packed, thus the cross-sectional flow area (trap-
ping area) at the entrance to the stainless steel wool is only 0.1 sq. in.

Although a particle trap was not installed between the second hold-up
volume and the charcoal bed, it was considered and was definitely needed.
Also the entrance section of future beds should be redesigned such that gas
enters the empty chamber above the steel wool and thus offer a larger cross
section of stainless steel wool to gas flow as in the MK-II trap.

Another argument that fission products, as well as hydrocarbons, are

“involved in the plugging mechanism at the charcoal bed entrance, is the fact

that the beds remained free of plugging until power operations were begun.
For a better understanding of the plugging mechanism, the MK-II particle
trap and the entrance section to one of the charcoal beds would need to be
examined. Also at least one bed could be examined along its length to de-
termine the fission product adsorption characteristics of the bed.

The probable reason that the overflow tank exit line remained clear

for such a long time was the fact that pressure differentials (v3.5 psi)

 
 

214

were periodically released through the line each: time salt was returned to
the pump bowl. The pressure pulses probably cleared any incipient plug
which may have been in its formative stage. ERE

The restriction at the fuel pump bowl does not seem to be related to
fission products since the plug &eems to form as readily if not more so
while subcritical and at low power as it does at full power. The gas exit
line from the pump bowl should be modified to eliminate mist or liquid car-
ryover into the off-gas stream. A heated cyclone-type separator’? or a
large well baffled and cooled region which could be later heated to melt
down any salt formation are two possibilities.

If hydrocarbons had not been present in the pump bowl, fission gas be-
‘havior in the MSRE might have been somewhat different from that experienced.
Some speculations on. probable results are (1) less serious overall plugging
because there would be no semisolid varnish-like buildup due to hydrocar-
bons, (2) the York mesh would probably be less efficient at trapping the
solid decay daughters and more of this material would then be trapped on
the felt metal filter, (3) the fission product "cake" would probably be
loosely packed on the filter and more easily disrupted by backflow since

it would not contain a "binder" or paste material (hydrocarbons).

9. FUEL AND COOLANT PUMP LUBE OIL SYSTEMS
J. K. Franzreb

9.1 Description

Two identical oil systems served to:lubricate and cool the fuel and
coolant pump bearings and to cool the shield plugs located between the
bearings and the bowls of the pumps. Each was a closed loop designed to
meet containment requirements. The oil used was Gulf-Spin 35.

Each system consisted of two 5-hp, 60-gpm at 160-ft head, 3500-rpm
Allis Chalmers Electri~Cand pumps, (one normally in operation with the other
in standby), an in-line Cuno. EFS oil filter, and an oil tank of 22-gal op-
erating capacity having "brazed on" water coils capable of removing 41,000
Btu/hr. -

The oil flow to the bearings of each of the salt pumps was about 4 gpm
. with about 8 gpm to each shield plug. The remaining 48 gpm was recycled
through the oil tank to aid in cooling. A scavenging jet was installed in
the oil lines near the salt pump so that the shield plug oil flow aided the
return of the bearing oil to. the storage tank.

Lubricating oil seeping past the lower shaft seal of the salt pump was
piped to the oil catch tank for measuring the rate of leakage.

The pumps, storage tank, filter and much of the instrumentation and
valving for each system were mounted in an angle iron frame to facilitate
moving to the site. This was commonly referred to as a lube-oil package.
The two packages were interconnected so that either could be used in an

emergency to supply both salt pumps.

9.2 Installation and Early Problems

© Before installation at the MSRE, both lube-o0il packages were operated
in a test stand. Heat load and pressure drop data were obtained and the
performance of the systems was. checked. A problem of gas entrainment was
found which affected the priming of the standby pumps. Approximately
30 seconds were required to prime a spare pump if it had not been operated

for several hours. Priming time was reduced to 5 sec by installing gas

 
 

 

216

vents from the pump volute casing and the pump discharge line to the gas
space in the oil tank. This experience led to a modus operendi of starting
the spare pump of each package once per shift and running it for ebout

15 min. .

The packages were installed at the MSRE in 1964. Initial operation
was hampered by failure of the stator insulation in one of the pump motors
and by low resistence to ground in stators of others. Since moisture was
suspected, a potting compound (Dow Corning Silastic RTV-T31l) was used to

seal the motor housing joints and a moisture resistant coating of paint
(Sherwin Williams epoxy white B69W6) was applied to the exterior surfaces
of all four operating motors, plus two spares.

The loss of prime of the standby pumps continued to be a problem until
the scavenging Jets used to return oil to the reservoirs from the salt pumps
were replaced with jets of lower capacity to reduce the entrainment of gas
- in the return oil streams. These replacements were done in September 1965.
After modifications, it was possible to reduce the frequency of priming of
. the standby pumps to once a week.

Because of the lowered capacity of the new return Jets, it was found
necessary to limit the flow of oil to the fuel-pump motor to Ut gpm, as a
flow of 5 gpm would result in a buildup of oil in the salt pump motor cavity.

‘

9.3 Addition of Syphon Tanks to the Qil Catch Tanks

The oil catch tanks were fabricated of a 46-1/2-in.-long section of

" 2-in. pipe topped by a 20-in.-long section of 8-in. pipe. The lower sec-
tion allowed accurate measurement of the oil accumilation rate whereas the
upper portion provided sufficient volume to handle possible gross leakage.
The catch tanks were drained periodically to keep the level in the lower.
section. Radiation would not permit doing this during power operation and
since the volume of the lower section was around 2500 cc and the alloweble.
seal leak rate was 100 cc/day, it was possible that the reactor would have
to be shut down to drain the oil catch tanks during extended runs. There-
fore, in October 1965, equipment was installed to automatically siphon the
oil from the catch tanks when they became full.
 

217

After installation, tests were run on these and they performed well.
However, they failed to function properly at the low oil leakage rates that
actually occurred during operation. The oil flowed over the high point of
the syphon tubes, as over a weir, without bridging the tube to form a sy-
phon. We therefore reverted. to manual draining during shutdowns. Fortu-
nately the leak rates did not get high enough to interfere with operation

of the reactor.

9.4 0il Leakage

Continuous records of oil tank and oil catch tank levels were main- °
tained during all of the MSRE operating life to determine what losses were

taking place. Samples removed from the systems were carefully measured,

as were additions. The oil storage tanks were large and therefore small
. changes in level indication caused .large errors in inventory. Successive

log readings could vary by 500 to 600 cc. Fairly accurate indication of

the leskage through the rotating oil seals of the salt pumps to the oil

- seals of the salt pumps to the oil catch tanks were possible over one month

or longer periods. The leak rates during operation varied from a few cc

per day for either salt pump to around 25 cc/day. The seals seemed to get

“worse or improve for no apparent reason.

For the 24-month period through August 1969, inventories showed unac-

counted for losses from the fuel pump oil system of 5.L4 5 liters; from
the coolant oil system of 5.6 500 liters or average daily losses of T.5 cc

(5.25 gms), and 7.8 cc (5.4 gms) respectively. Analyses indicated that
there were approximately 1 to-2 gms of oil products per day in-the fuel

pump off-gas stream. Some oil ‘may have been held up in the lines, 6-ft3

holdup volume, and particle traps that were upstream of this sampling point.

In conclusion, the best estimates showed an oil loss of 5+ gms/day,
of which only 1 - 2 gms could be found as hydrocarbons in samples of off-

gas from the primary system, leaving approximately 3 gus /day unaccounted

for.

9.5 Change-Out of 0il Pumps

After the initial trouble with the electrical insulation due to mois-
ture, the pumps gave very satisfactory service. Two pumps ‘were removed
from service, one because of excessive vibration and the other because of
an electrical short in the motor winding. This was done during the six-
month period ending August 31, 1967. B oo oo

The pump with excessive vibration had one of the two balancing disks
loose on the shaft. This loose disk was reattached, and the shaft assembly
was dynamically balanced. The pump was reassembled, tested under operating
conditions and made ready for service. The pump with the shorted winding

was rewound and put back into service.

9.6 Test Check of One 0il System
» Supplying Both the Fuel and Coolant Salt Pumps

~ On March 20, 1966, the two oil systems were valved so that the fuel
oil package (FOP-2 running) supplied oil to both salt pumps. This was done
to check calculations, and to be sure that this could indeed be done in
some future emergency. The coolant pump was circulating salt at 1200°F;
the fuel pump was idle and at a temperature of 125°F, Adequate flows to
both salt pumps were maintained (3.35 gpm to the bearings and 6.5 and 7.3
gpm to the coolant and fuel pump shield plugs). Under these conditions the
oil supply temperature equilibrated at 127°F. When the fuel pump oil flow
was stopped, the oil supply temperature increased ~ T°F, indicating that
the fuel pump vas removing part of the heat load of the oil system.

Although this test did not prove conclusively that one oil cooling

system was adequate for an emergency wherein one package would be used to
supply both operating salt pumps, subsequent heat exchanger tests and cal-
culations indicated that one oil cooling system would be adequate.’

9.7 0il Temperature Problems

this, 8 gpm_was directed to the shield plug of the salt pump in the par-
ticular system, 4 gpm to the salt pump bearings, and the balance was by-

passed back into the oil tanks and caused to flow down the outer tank walls.
 

oil system, and 3°F in the case of the fuel-pump oil system.

219

This amount plus the warm oil from the shield and bearings was cooled by
means of water flow through coils brazed to the outside of the carbon steel
tanks. : oo

As the system was subjected to extended service, scale built up on the
inside surfaces of these coils, causing a drop in the cooling capacity.
This in turn caused the temperature of the supply oil to climb from its
normal 134°F to 14LO°F. This higher temperature was reached during March
of 1966. Co ;

Both of the lube oil tanks coils were flushed with a 15-wgt % solution
of acetic acid. Considerable material was removed, and the oil tempera-

tures, upon restarting, were reduced T°F in the case of the coolant pump

During subsequent operation the temperature of the fuel pump oil grad-
ually rose, and in August 1966, this acetic acid treatment was again given
both coolers.

This problem of gradual fouling of the water side of the cooling coils

 

recurred throughout subsequent operations, and by December 1967, the tem-
perature of the oil supplied to the pumps was up to 150°F, The water sup-

ply was changed from tower water to cooler untreated "process water" which

in the case of the MSRE was taken directly from the potable water system

via a backflow preventer. The system was left on process water for two
months and the heat transfer improved enough, probsbly by physical flushing
out of the scale, so that tower water could again be used and afford satis-
factory cooling of the oil.. This switching had to be done at least twice

‘more before the reactor was finally shut down in December 1969. A semi--

permanent hose and piping system was provided so this could be done expe-

ditiously.
9.8 Increase in Radiation Level at the Lube .0il Packages

At the beginning of power. operation in August: 1969, a radiation moni-

tor at the reservoir of the fuel pump oil system indicated radiation from

the upper part of the tank wes increasing and. decreasing with reactor power.

Using the on-site gamma spectrometer, it was determined that the activity

was “argon, This was apparently produced by activation of the blanket gas
220

in the upper part of the fuel pump motor cavity. Prior to this time only
‘helium had been used during power operation, and no gas activation had oc-
curred. Argon was being used at this time to investigate bubbles in the
fuel loop. Since radietion levels did not ‘exceed 2 zR/hr end decreased
when the cover gas was changed back to helium, this was not a serious

problem.
9.9 Analysis of 0il

Samples were taken of each new supply arun end from the two lube oil
systems after circulating for a short time. Analyses of these were used as
controls, to compare with periodic samples taken from the systems during
operation. The main concern wes that the oil, especially in the fuel pump
system, might undergo some changes due to long-time circulation through the
high flux field in the pump or that there might be some thermal decompo-
sition.

Table 9.1 is a compilation of some typical oil analyses performed
during the life of the MSRE. The only significant or even minor changes
that were found were that the OH radical increased somewhat and some C=0
was formed, probebly indicating some small degree of oxidation. Tritium
buildup was insignificant.

The oil which leaked ‘through the seals to the oil catch tanks, al-
though dark in color, showed no significant chemical or physical changes.

An addition fractional distillation test analysis was run on a sample
of new Gulfspin-35 oil on September 2, 1964. This was distilled under re-
duced pressure (3-4 mm Hg) in an 18-in. reflux column. As indicated below, |
most of the atstillstion occurred between 148 and 178°.

9.10 Replacement, of 0il

The first charge of Gulfspin-35 oil was added in September 196 as the
oil tanks were calibrated. ‘Each tank took about 35 gallons. Periodic ad-
ditions were made to compensate for losses. oo

As indicated previously, no significant physical of chemical changes

occurred which would indicate that the oil should be replaced. Various oil

| companies were contacted and they did not have any suggestions as to other

means of checking for damage. However, as protection against undetected

changes, the oil was replaced in August 1966 and again in May 1967.
9.11 Discussion and Recommendations

Except for the priming difficulties with the pumps and the moisture
troubles with the motors, the systems operated very satisfactorily.

No noticeable change occurred in the lubricating oil. However, more
information is needed as to what chemical analysis or physical tests should
be made to detect undesirable changes. A more realistic sampling schedule
needs to be established.

Improvements in future heat exchangers for this service should be made.
Excess capacity should be provided to compensate for fouling of the heat

transfer surfaces or better cooling water inhibitors should be used.

10. COMPONENT COOLING SYSTEMS
) P. H., Harley

The primary and secondary component coolant systems consisted of com-
pressors and associated equipment required to gas-cool various components
in the fuel and coolant systems. Although they performed similar functions,
the two were completely independent and are therefore described separately.

10.1 Primary System

10.1.1 Description
Cell atmosphere gas (95% Nj, 5% 0p), commonly called "cell air" was

recirculated by one of two T5-hp belt-driven positive displacement pumps
(component coolant pumps). The other pump was a spare which could be manu-
ally started if needed. Each pump was located in a containment enclosure
or dome which could be opened for maintenance. After compression by the
component coolant pump, the cell air passed through a water-cooled shell-
and~tube heat exchanger and then to the reactor and drain tank cells for
distribution to the freeze valves, control rods, reactor neck, and fuel-
-pump cooling shroud. A side stream was circulated past a radistion moni-
tor to indicate cell-air activity and could be exhausted to the containment

stack for evacuating the cells.

10.1.2 Initial Testing

The initial testing was primarily a check of the system design. Flows
to equipment .were measured .and interdependence of. flows was checked. The
system was leak-tested and the heat transfer coefficient of the gas cooler
was measured.

Permanent flowmeters were not installed since most of the flows were
set initially and then not ‘changed. During installation of piping, various
flows were measured with temporarily installed rotameters. Since air flow
“to the fuel-pump shroud needed to be varied, a permanent orifice was in-
stalled when tests indicated that air loading on the control valve was not
an adequate.indication of air flow,

Initial flows were adequate except for cooling the control rods. Suf-

ficient flow was obtained by removing a discharge block valve. This block

 
 

 

 

 

224

valve was intended to close on high cell-air activity to prevent gross con-
tamination of the cell in case a control rod thimble ruptured. In lieu of
the block valve, the discharge air was routed through a 55-gallon stain-
less steel drum located in the reactor cell to retain -any salt which leaked
due to the rupture. : Co :

The measured flows are given in Teble 10.1 Tests indicated that chang-
ing one flow had no effect on the other flows even when the cell was being
evacuated at about 200 scfm. . The pressure control valve (PCV-960) which
discharges excess air back to the cell adequately compensated for the vary-=
ing flows and maintained a constant discharge pressure.

10.1.3 Blower Capacity

Design of in-cell MSRE components initially required a gas-cooling
capacity of 885 scfm. However, development tests indicated that cooling
air would not be required on the freeze flanges. Therefore, the blower
capacity was lowered to “61T scfin by installing a smaller sheave on the:
drive motor. .

After about two-years operation, more circulation was deemed necessary
between drain tank cell and reactor cell. This was to give a more rapid
response on the cell air activity monitors in case of a leak into the drain
~ tank cell. A larger diameter drive sheave was installed to give a blower
capacity of TO scfm and a 2-in. line was installed from the freeze valve
supply header to the drain tank cell. This gas (v200 scfm) flowed from the
drain tank cell into the reactor cell and back to the component coolant
pump suction. This TUO scfm was used for all subsequent operation. During
rapid evacuation of the cell, it was necessary to close a hand valve in

this line in order to maintain an adequate flow to other components.
10.1.4 Gas Cooler

The heat removal by the gas cooler was adequate throughout-the opera-
tion. The initial heat transfer coefficient calculated to be 36.5 Btu/hr
ft2 °F with a flow rate of 885 scfm. After two years of operation and st
e flow rate of THO scfm, it was 28 Btu/hr ft2 °F and has remained at ap-
proximately this same value. No inspection has been made to determine how
much oil and/or belt dust is deposited on the gas side (shell side). of the

tubes,

10.1.5 CCP Drive Units

Originally the component coolant pumps were driven by five matched
belts using a 15.9-in. drive sheave and a 2l-in. drive sheave. When the
blower capacity was reduced by changing to a 10.9-in. drive sheave, belt
difficulties developed. The first set of belts failed after 1450 hours of
operation and the second set only 11 hours later. The smaller diameter
drive sheave increased the bending stresses to values in excess of the belt
ratings. To correct. this, in February 1966, the drive and drive sheave dia-
meters were increased to 12.5 and 2k in. respectively. To obtain a better
belt loading, the initial matched belt sets were replaced by a poly-V-belt.
Then in August 1966, the drive sheave was increased to 15-in. diameter to
increase blower capacity. This further reduced bending stresses on the
belt,

The original belts were rated at 200°F whereas the poly-V-belts were
only rated at 130°F. This caused difficulty since the ambient temperature
in the domes was about 170°F due to motor heat and leakage of 320°F gas
from the discharge relief valves. Rupture discs were installed to prevent
leakage but they would not withstand the shock received when the blowers
were started. Baffles were then installed which deflected the cooler in-
coming gas across the belts and thus lowered the ambient temperature to
around 150°F.

To magnify the drive belt difficulties, the motor support was not sat-
isfactory. The motor could slip on its support plate and flexing of the
motor support legs caused a pulsating load on the drive belts. Small blocks
were welded to the support bracket to keep the motor from slipping and heavy
bracing of the stand minimized the vibration. Since the largest: strain oc-
curred on the drive belts when the blower was started, one blower was oper-
ated continuously during a run instead of alternating the blowers twice a
month as was done initially. This increased the belt life to more than
8000 hours and uninterrupted runs of over 3000 hours were made without belt

adjustments.-

10.1.6 0il System

One of the component coolant pumps (CCP-1) had to be stopped during
Run 10 in January 1967 because of low oil pressure, and CCP-2 was used for
227

the remainder of the run. After Run 10, a cracked copper fitting in the
oil system was repaired, and 2 gallon of oil was added to bring the oil
level back to normal. Drains were also installed to return any oil seal
leakage back to the oil reservoir. |

More trouble was: encountered in the CCP=1 oil circulating system during
Run 12, First, a loose tubing connection caused the loss of ~2 gal. of oil.
This was repaired in August 1967. When the blower was restarted, intermit-
tent low oil-pressure alarms again occurred, An investigation indicated
no significant loss of oil, but a slow oil-pressure response was observed
when the blower was started. The suspected oil pump and pressure-relief
valve were replaced with spare units to correct the trouble. Later inspec-
tion indicated that the oil pump was not damaged but the pressure-relief
valve was relieving before the normal oil pressure developed. In spite of
this difficulty, adequate lubrication had been maintained and there was no
damage to the blower, The oil pressure relief valve on CCP-2 was inspected
and also found to relieve at too low a pressure and was readjusted.

In September 1967, after six days of flush-salt circulation and two
days of nuclear operation, CCP-2 was shut down by low oil pressure. Since
the discharge valve would not close leak-tight, the run was terminated.
Repairs consisted of repairing the leaking discharge valve, capping a leak-
ing drain liné and tightening several packing nuts and fittings. The other
blower, CCP-1, was used for 873 hours into November 1967. At this time a
serious oil leak was indicated by low oil pressure and accumulation of about
2 gal. of oil:in the condensate collection tank connected to the blower
containment, The standby unit, CCP-2, was immediately started up and oper-
ated without further difficulties throughout the remainder of the run,
3,036 hours.

In July 1968, the brazed tubing oil system on both blowers was re-
placed by welded pipe end - flexible hose. This eliminated most of the pro-
blems with the oil system. A lesky shaft oil seal had to be replaced in
December 1969. |

10.1.7 Strainer.

In August 1966, a temporary strainer with a 1/16-in, screen was in-

stalled in the component-cooling-pump discharge line to collect rubber dust

 
 

 

 

 

228

from the drive belts, and prevent blowing this material onto the hot metal
components being cooled. Although the temporary strainer worked satisfac-
torily a new strainer made of 100-mesh screen, which had been on order for
a year, was installed in the line in May 1967. Over an eight-month period,
the temporary strainer had accumulated 30 to 50 g of black, dry powdery ma-
terial that appeared to be dust from gbresion of the drive belts. After
being decontaminated, the strainer was examined and was found to be in very
good condition. The surface was slightly etched, but no more than would
be caused by the decontamination process. oo

The new strainer developed excessive pressure drop in September 1967
and the screen was replaced. In 1,800 hours of operation the 100-mesh screen
had become partially plugged with rubber dust from the drive belts. It was
damaged in removal and a replacement basket was made using 16-mesh, 0.023-
in. wire screen. This showed no pressure buildup over the subsequent 2

years of operation.
10.1.8 Condensate Collection

After a reactor cell space cooler began to leak water into the cell in
March 1966, condensate accumulated in the 10-in. suction line to the com-
ponent coolant pumps at a rate of 1 to 2 gpd. The water was vaporizing in
the reactor cell and condensing on cold surfaces at the component coolant
pumps. Simple drains were installed, but these could be used only when the
reactor was subcritical due to radiation in the coolant drain tank cell.
Handling of the drained water was complicated by the tritium (up to 915
ue/me produced from the 6Li in the treated-water corrosion inhibitor or
from diffusion through primary piping. During the shutdown in August 1966,
piping was installed to permit draining the domes during power operation
to a tank in the sump room. It was periodically pumped from this tank to
the liquid waste tank.

© 10.1.9 Electrical

In June 1966, the wiring to CCP-1 drive motor shorted out in the pene-
tration into the containment enclosure. The short tripped the main breaker
to generator bus No. 3 as well as the component coolant pump breaker. The

pump and other equipment on bus No. 3 stopped. Emergency diesel power was
 

 

229

started immediately, but because of a misinterpretation of the problem, the
reactor drained before cooling was restored to the freeze valves by swite-
hing to CCP-2, The short occurred in an epoxy seal on the end of the
copper-sheathed mineral insulated cable and was caused either by moisture
from in-cell leskage or a breakdown of the epoxy potting compound.

Wiring changes were made to both component cooling drive motors to
prevent a reoccurrence. Each phase of the three phase circuits was brought
through a separate penetration and the epoxy was omitted from the end seals.
No further difficulties were encountered.

10,1.10 - Valve Problems

Isolation valves were provided on each component coolant pump to per-

mit repairing one while the other was in operation. These large valves

- (10 in. on the inlet and 6 in. on the outlet) had back-seating stems on tef-

lon seats to prevent leakage when the valves were open. These proved to
be very satisfactory. After about 3-years service, one of the 6-in. iso-

lation valves leaked in excess of 100 cfd. An inspection revealed several

- large pits in the seating surface of the valve which had been filled with

epoxy during manufacture, These were repaired by filling with weld metal
and then refinishing the seating surface. When reassembled, the leakage
through the valve was ~0.5-cfd which was considered to be satisfactory.

Check valves were installed on the discharge of the blowers to prevent

backflow through the stand-by unit. These were 6-in. butterfly-type valves

with silicone rubber hinges holding two flappers in place. In January 1966,
after 1640 hours of service, the hinge on the CCP-2 valve broke allowing

one flapper to fall off, No spares were available so flappers and hingers

were made at ORNL, This had not failed after 1800 hours but was replaced

by factory-built parts. In November 1966, the butterfly check valve from
CCP-1 was found to be inoperative and was repaired. The failure also oc-
curred at the silicone rubber hinge which supports the two wings of the
check valve, |

On one occasion during the period when belt problems were causing loss

of blower capacity, the stem of the in-cell pressure control valve (PACV-

960) froze in a partially open position and failed to close when the valve

operator air loading increased. This was the only failure of an in-cell

 
 

230

component in this system. The valve was removed remotely and repacked.

The stem vas polished and lightly lubricated before reinstallation. - To
prevent the valve from remaining in one throttled position for an extended
time, the pressure controller was subsequently cycled periodically to be
sure the valve was functioning. Moisture in the circulating air probably
contributed to the valve failure, and the periodic draining of the collected

moisture has helped prevent a reoccurrence.
-'10.1.11 Conclusions and Recommendations

Although many difficulties have been encountered with equipment, only
two reactor drains have been caused directly by component cooling system
failures. One was loss of one blower while the other was isolated for main-
tenance and the second was a failure of electrical cable to the motor of
one compressor (ccp-1). One run was restarted after repairing an oil leak
which developed early in the run.

Better design specifications would have assured more serviceable items.
For instance, the pressure relief valves had a specified capacity at 15
psig, however, they discharged a small amount of gas continuously at nor-
mal operating pressure. This caused excess heating of the equipment in the
containment domes. Combining overpressure protection with an unloading
valve and controls would have permitted blower startup without load and
caused less wear on the drive belts. A more dureble hinge would have pre-
vented the check valve failures.

More instrumentation on gas flows and on the oil system would have
given earlier indication of pending difficulties. Oil sump level and dis-
charge pressure with indicators outside the containment would have helped
here.

Although sufficient capacity was availeble, only minimum capacities
were available for cooling at some locations because of limiting pressure
drops of piping and control valves. More design consideration should have
been given to the possibility of needing additional cooling. After cor-
recting blower drive problems during the first two years of operation, sev-
eral reactor runs were made in excess of 3000 hours with only preventative

meintenance between runs.
231

10.2 Secondary System

10.2.1 Description

Ambient air for cooling out-of-cell components was supplied by either
a 60-scfm positive displacement pump (CCP-3) or a piston-type air com-
pressor (AC-3). The air was distributed to the coolant system drain freeze

valves and to the chemical processing plant freeze valves.
10.2.2 Operating Experience

Early testing revealed that the flow to FV-204 and FV-206 was insuf-
ficient to establish good plugs in the freeze valves. The air-operated
control valve trim was enlarged to reduce the pressure drop and the blower
discharge pressure was increased from 8 to 9.25 psig. With these changes,
adequate air capacity, 25 scfm, was obtained to each freeze valve.

In April 1967, the drive shaft of the rotary blower, CCP-3, seized. in
the brass sleeve bearing of the blower housing and did extensive damage to
the drive shaft. Operation was continued using the service air compressor,
AC-3, which was the standby supply to keep FV-20h and FV-206 frozen, A
second bearing failure occurred in CCP-3 after only 200 hours of operation
following the first failure, Since that time, AC-3 has been used as the
normal cooling air supply with CCP-3 as a standby unit. CCP-3 was used
during programmed maintenance on AC-3 and while freezing FV-204 and FV-206
when more air was required than the air regulator from AC-3 would supply.

. A brass swinging gate check valve which prevented backflow through
CCP-3 -when -the service air compressor was used, failed because of wear
caused by .pulsating flow when CCP-3 was in service. This check valve was
“replaced by a hand valve. Then, when the air compressor was changed to the
normally operated supply, a new check valve was installed so the blower
could be restarted remotely if a low header pressure alarm occurred. The
hand valve was left installed s0 the blower could be isolated if the check

valve failed again.
10.2.3 Conclusions

The positive displacement pump (CCP-3) which was intended as the prime
air mover functioned poorly. However, the service air compressor (AC-1)
was very relisble and thus little or no operating time was lost due to this

system,

11. VENTILATION SYSTEM
~ P, H. Harley

11.1 Description

The purpose of the ventilation system was to exhaust air from areas
where there was a potential danger of release of radioactivity. The air
flowed through a network of ducts to the filter pit which contained 3 paral-
lel banks of roughing filters and absolute filters. It was pulled through
the filter pit by one of the two stack fans end was then discharged up a
100-ft stack to the atmosphere. The stack was continuously monitored to
assure that the radioactivity released was within acceptable limits. Sen-
sitive differential pressure gages were installed to indicate the direction

of.air flow between the various areas.
11.2 Operating Experience

After installation of the ventilation system was complete, a series of
tests was run to insure that the criteria would be met. Several minor
changes were made in the ducting, cell blocks were caulked, and lesks re-
paired. The biggest problem encountered was sealing the hi-bay. Gaskets
were installed on the doors, all joints in the lining were taped, and a
number of large holes were plugged. The leakage into the hi-bay was meas-
ured as follows. The dampers in the ventilation ducts from all other areas
were closed. All inlet vents and doors to the hi-bay Vere closed. The
dampers between the hi-bay and the stack fans were throttled until the hi-
bay pressure was —0.3 inches of water. The in-leskage (stack flow) was’
found to be 4250 £t3/min. Although this was above the design value of
1000 £t3/min, it was accepted. ) EEE

The pitot tube stack gas flow meter was calibrated using a hot wire
anemometer. - Several traverses were made under various flow conditions.

" The flow under normal operating conditions was: found to be around 23,000
cfm. The stack calibration curve and details of the calibration are given
in MSRE Test Memo and Test Report 2.3.15.

Tests indicated that adequate ventilation could be maintained with 2
of the 3 parallel filter banks in service. Therefore, it was possible to
replace one bank of filters without interrupting operations.
 

 

 

233

After installation, the ebsolute filters did not pass the standard
ORNL-DOP smoke test.'S (99.95% efficiency is required.) Visual inspection
.indicated leakage around the frames which required considerable caulking
and some minor revisions. On 11/14/64 all three banks passed the DOP test
(East = 99.970%; Center = 99.972%; and West = 99.967% efficient). The next
test in May of 1965 indicated that all three banks had dropped to less than
99.90%. efficient. Therefore, they were removed and extensive recaulking
and revisions were made to improve their efficiency and assure that they
could be replaced remotely. The results of subsequent DOP tests are shown
in Teble 11,1,

It has not been necessary to replace the absolute filters since 1965.
The pressure drop through them had changed very little during the Li years
of operation which indicates that the roughing filters performed well and
removed most of the particulates.

The roughing filters were changed when the pressure drop across them
- reached 5 to 6 inches of water at which time the stack flow would be down
to “v18;000 cfm. During earlier operation while considerable maintenance
and construction was still being done, these plugged rather rapidly. Small
easily changed fiberglass filters installed on several of the inlet duets
reduced the plugging rate. Subsequent filter changes are shown in Table
11.2. The last set of roughing filters read 500 mR/hr at 3 inches after
they were removed.

Some difficulty was encountered in early operation with stack fan No.
1 (SF-1) bearings. The bearings were initially grease-lubricated and there
was difficulty in maintaining proper lubrication. The normal bearing life
was sbout four months. In 1966, an oil-lubricating system was installed
and the subsequent bearing life has been about 18 months. SF-1 was run
continuously except when necessary to do maintenance on it, SF-2 served
as a standby unit. a.

Sensitive differential pressure gages (full scale = 2 inches of water)
.were provided to indicate direction of air flow. These were recorded each
shift on the building log and dampers were adjusted as necessary. Venti-
lation flow was from the less hazardous to the more hazardous area except
in the coolant cell during power operation. When the main radiator blowers

were operating, considerable air leaked from the radiator and pressurized

the coolant cell. In an effort to correct this, the inlet to one of the
radiator auxiliary blowers (MB-2) was connected to the coolant cell. This
reduced the pressure below atmospheric but it was still above the hi-bay
pressure. Since the only hazard was from beryllium and since the coolant
stack was continuously monitored for beryllium, this was considered ac-
ceptable.

During maintenance, containment is provided by the flow of air into
the cells. The system has adequately supplied this need for all mainte-
nance operations.

There has been very little activity released to the atmosphere except
during maintenance periods. Even then, the releases have been below the
ORNL permissible limits. The permissible release rate from the 5 ORNL
stacks is nl curie per week, Table 11.3 is a tabulation of the amount of
activity released from the MSRE stack. The maximum released in any week
at the MSRE was 568 mCi during the week ending December 21, 1969. This
was mainly from the core specimen removal plus about 50 mCi from the pri-
mary system lesk which occurred during the final shutdown.,25

Due to a galled bolt, the core specimen hold-down flange could not be
reinstalled and was left hanging in the standpipe. Another flange was in-
stalled to close the system. Salt on the hold-down assembly probably con-
tributed to the larger than usual release. The standpipe vacuum was also

inadvertently left off on two occasions when it should have been on.
11.3 Conclusions and Recommendations

The ventilation system has functioned satisfactorily during operation
and maintenance. The installtion of easily removable filters st inlets to
the ventilation duets prolonged the life of the roughing filters and should
be considered in future designs.

The stack monitoring system could be improved. The recorders used

were very difficult to make notes on. This, together with the range chang-
ing feature of the system, made later interpretation of the charts very
difficult, In addition to this, the monitors were never calibrated. This
should have been done and limits on their readings should have been es-

tablished before starting operation.

12. WATER SYSTEMS
P. H. Harley

Water for various types of usage was supplied at the MSRE by the fol-
lowing systems: (1) the potable water system distributed ORNL water for
fire protection, general building services, and was the supply for the pro-
cess water system, (2) the process water system distributed water (potable
water which had gone through a backflow preventer to provide isolation) for
process usage, such as dilution of the liquid waste, for temporary or emer-

. + 12. Potable Water System

Two six-inch cast iron lines supply water to the MSRE area from the
supply main, One line supplies water to the fire sprinkler system and
“general building services and the other supplies mekeup to the process wa-
"ter system. CR ’

The underground supply line to the fire sprinkler system and building
services ruptured in the fall of 1967. ‘Repairs required shutting off both
potable water supplies to the area so process water makeup was supplied by
a fire hose from a vent line on the valley water main, Fire protection was
provided by n1/b mile of fire hose from the Nuclear Safety Pilot Plant and
posting of a fire watch at the local fire alarm box in the building. Iso-
lation valves where the lines teed off the water main would have simplified
the repairs. In December 1969, the other 6-in. supply line ruptured under-

3 ground. Process water was supplied from the other 6-in. main through a

 
 

 

238

temporary backflow preventer during repairs. In both cases, repairs were
made using a stainless steel Adams clamp.

Although no serious malfunctions have occurred in the automatic fire
sprinkler system, a better designed system could have been provided. The
MSRE system was installed from national fire protection specifications
without regard to area services. In some areas containing electrical equip-
ment, more Banger existed from possible water damage than from the possi-
bility of fire. In these areas the sprinklers were disconnected or iso-
lated with manual valves. Portable extinguishers suitable for electrical

fires have been provided in areas containing electrical equipment.
12.2 Process Water System

This system has performed very well. On a few occasions, process wa-
* ter was used for cooling critical equipment when repairs necessitated shut-
ting down the cooling tower water system. Process water which was “20°F
cooler than the cooling tower water was effective in cooling the fuel pump
and coolant pump oil tanks when the coils became fouled with scale. The
use of process water tended to flush the coils so that adequate cooling
could be obtained using cooling tower water.

The process water system was supplied by ORNL potsble water through
one backflow preventer. Another backflow preventer was installed in series
with this in the process water supply to the liquid waste tank. These
backflow preventers were scheduled to be tested semiannually. Actual test-
int occurred at intervals of 3 to 14 months. The main backflow preventer
-never required any repairs. The one in the line to the waste tank required
minor repairs on two occasions. Valving was provided to install a second
unit in parallel if repairs of the main operating backflow preventer were
required. However, the second unit was never installed. Instead the pro-
cess water flow was shut off to mske the periodic tests. For a more com-

Plex water system, two backflow preventers should be installed.

12.3 Cooling Tower Water System

Standard centrifugal pumps were used to circulate the cooling tower
water. Flow was adequate and no pump performance tests were made. The
cooling tower was a packaged commercial unit and provided adequate cooling.
Very adequate temperature control was obtained using a temperature con-
trolled valve which allowed part of the water to bypass the cooling tower.
One major pipe leak occurred which required shutting the entire system down.
This leak was in the underground six-inch return line to the cooling tower.

Nalco-360 balls, a mixture of sodium and potassium chromate containing
some phosphates, were used as a corrosion inhibitor.

In the summertime, a one-pound ball of Nalco-21S, an algae inhibitor,
was added daily and was satisfactory in preventing algae formation on the
cooling tower. Hardness was controlled by bleeding off about 2 gal. per
minute of cooling tower water. This water plus about 8 gallons per minute
of process water was used to cool the charcoal beds.

Over 1500 samples of cooling tower water were taken and analyzed.

Most ‘of these were analyzed at the site to assure adequate treatment. Peri-
odically the samples were sent to the laboratory for iron analysis. This
remained less then 1 ppm throughout the operation. Due to the continual
makeup and bleedoff from the system, good corrosion rate figures are not
available, however, no .leak has occurred which could be attributed to cor-
rosion. |

A considerable amount of calcium phosphate scale coated the rotameter
‘tubes, and cooling coils and left sludge in the cooling tower basin and low
: velocity areas of the treated water cooler. Equipment was installed to me-
ter a solution of potassium dichromate and zinc-sulfate inhibitor into the
"cooling tower water by a proportioning pump powered by the cooling tower
makeup water flow. When this pump failed to operate propertly, the change
in inhibitor was abandoned. Lights were installed behind the rotameters

to facilitate reading and minimize frequency of cleaning.

12.4 Treated Water Systems

12,4,1 Initial Fill and Operation

The treated water system was filled by adding steam condensate and
“corrosion inhibitor batchwise. The total volume was about 4000 gallons
with about 2300 gallons in the thermal shield.

12.4.2 Circulating Pumps

.-Standard centrifugal pumps were used to circulate the treated water
in a closed loop. The capacity was adequate and no pump performance tests
were made. The pumps have operated satisfactorily with little maintenance
other than repairing the rotating seals. Leakage from these was collected
in plastic bottles due to the induced activity in the water,

12.4.3 Thermal Shield

Initial testing indicated that excessive pressure would exist in the
thermal shield and that the flow was not adequate to the thermal shield
slides (sections of the sides which could be removed for replacing the re-
actor vessel). Piping changes were made to lower the back pressure and to
provide a separate supply line and pump to assure adequate flow in the
slides. During early operation, several rupture discs in the thermal
shield discharge lines were ruptured due to the supply and discharge valve
closing simultaneously. To prevent this, the supply valve was modified so
that it would close before the discharge valve closed.

The water level was noted to increase in the surge tank when the re-
actor power was increased and the level decreased when the reactor was sub-
critical. Decomposition of the water was producing v2 cubic feet per hour
of Hy gas at full power and about 8 £t3 of this gas collected in one of the
TS slides in which it is postulated the water piping was reversed, i.e.,
water entering the top and leaving from a dip leg near the bottom. A small
deaerating tank installed in the water supply to the TS slide permitted
n2 £t3 of gas to redissolve when the system reached equilibrium. Later a
large degasing tank was installed to deaerate the water leaving the TS to
permit more Hy; to be dissolved. This reduced the accumulate gas to a3 £3,

Initially a purge of No and later air was introduced into the surge tank
241

end degasing tank to flush the gas space and dilute the Hy to below the
~ explosive limit. No further difficulties were encountered, however,

n3/h-gal. of water/day was lost by evaporation in the purge gas.
12.4.4 Reactor and Drain Tank Cell Space Coolers

Two space coolers were installed in the reactor cell and one in the
drain tank cell to keep the cell air temperatures below 150°F. The meas-
ured capacity was only 40 to 60 kW compared to the design value of T5 kW.
However, the cell temperatures normally ran at ebout 140°F for the reactor
cell and 130°F for the drain tank cell. oo

The 3-hp fen motors originally installed on the space coolers, were
adequate for the normal operating pressure of =P psig but were too small
for higher pressures such as could be encountered in the event of an acci-
dent. They were, therefore replaced with 10-hp motors. One of these on
the drain tank cell cooler failed after 2900 hours of operation due to the
rotor slipping on the shaft, Since the trouble appeared to be caused by
faulty construction rather than poor design, it was replaced by an identi-
cal motor.

Before the cells were sealed, a reactor cell cooler (RCC-2) developed
a leak at a header-to-tube brazed fitting. Repairs proved to be difficult
because heat required for brazing one leak would cause an adjacent tube to
start leaking. After the cell was sealed, a 1-1/2 gallon per day water
leak was traced to another brazed fitting leak on RCC-1. This was re-—
paired. - In July 1967, RCC-2 again started leaking and was replaced by one
of three newly obtained units in which the copper tubes were heliarc-welded

(instead of brazed) to the main header.
12.4.5 In-Cell Water Leaks

In-cell water leaks have persisted throughout the reactor operation.
Before the cells were sealed, components could be checked visually but af-
ter power operation, locating treated water leaks required hydrostatic
~ testing of in-cell components. Although all known leaks such as at the
space coolers were repaired, we continued to have a leak into the cell of
1/2 to 1 gallons per day. Water from this small leak did not collect in
the cell sump but evaporated in the 130 to 14O°F cell gas and then con-

densed in a colder portion of the containment, the suction lines and gas

 
 

 

242

cooler of the component cooling system. This condensate was found to con-
tain considersble amounts of tritium. Drains were installed to permit’
draining the condensate to a measuring tank in the sump room from which it
could be pumped to the liquid waste storage.

The nuclear instrument penetration was one of the suspected sources
of the leak. Since it could not be hydrostatically tested, 12 kg of Dy0
vas added as a tracer. This increased the deuterium concentration to about
seven times the normal water concentration. Since the deuterium concentra-
tion did not increase in samples of the cell condensate, a leak from the

nuclear instrument penetration was discounted.
12.4.6 Treated Water Heat Exchanger

The heat exchanger installed to transfer the heat from the treated wa-
ter to the cooling tower water was a surplus tube-and-shell unit. During
preoperational tests the tubes had to be rerolled and tube sheet gasket re-
placed to eliminate intermixing of treated water and cooling tower water.
After a year of operation, 17 tubes which had developed cracks where the
tubes were rolled into the tube sheet were plugged. This was probably
caused by the earlier tube repairs. When leaks again developed in the TW
cooler, more tubes were plugged but when attempts to seal the flanged tube
sheet were unsuccessful, the heat exchanger was replaced with another sur-
plus unit which was smaller but still had adequate cooling capacity. Af-
ter replacing the heat exchanger, sodium from the cooling tower system had
to be removed from the treated water by dilution with steam condensate and
new inhibitor was added. The activation of the 1.6 ppm of sodium left in
the treated water after the dilution raised the radiation level of the sys-
tem to 80 mR/hr at surge tank and 260 mR/hr at the filter but did not seri-

ously affect reactor operation.
12.4.7 Valves

Containment of the treated water system depended upon air-operated
block valves and check valves. None of the block valves lesked during the
annual containment checks. However, several of the piston-type ‘check valves
leaked excessively. Foreign material and scale caused some of the valves

to bind in the open position due to the close clearance between the valve

\&/
 

243

body and the plug. The valves were mounted in horizontal pipes which
probably magnified the problem.

Pressure relief valves were installed to prevent damage to in-cell
components in case the block valves closed. These discharged to the liquid
waste tank. Leakage from these occurred several times. The first indi-
cation was usually an increase in rate of condensate makeup. Pinpointing
the leak involved disconnecting piping from each relief valve. Power re-

duction was necessary to accomplish this.
12.4.8 Corrosion Inhibitor

The treated water system was first filled with condensate containing
2000 ppm of a 75-25% mixture of potassium nitrite-potassium’ tetra-borate.

Induced activity ug at low reactor power was extrapolated to radia-
tion levels of 400 mR/hr at the surge tank in the water room and filter in
the diesel house when the reactor was at full power. To prevent this radi-
"ation, the potassium inhibitor was changed to lithium, Lithium-7 was used
to minimize the production of tritium which would be formed in the thermal
shield.. The potassium was removed by dilution with demineralized water
from ORNL but had to be repeated using steam condensate because the demin-
eralized water which contained:1 ppm of sodium became radioactive during
- the next run. The new inhibitor was composed of lithium nitrite, boric
acid, and. lithium hydroxide. .

During early power operation, the treated water lost active inhibitor.
Samples indicated that. 300-500 ppm Hy09 was being produced by radiation
damage which oxidized LiNO,- to LiNOg. Additional LiNO,; was added until

equilibrium of ~“NO,— NO3 was reached with A700 ppm of ~NO3 in the water.
. Approximately 365 semples of the treated water were taken. Most of
these were analyzed at the site to assure that adequate treatment was be-

ing maintained.
12.4.9 Corrosion

Corrosion. 4n, the treated water systen hes not been significant. Dur-
ing most of - the operation, samples were analyzed monthly for loss of in-
hibiter, pH and:iron. In 1969, chromium and nickel analyses were added

to further check for corrosion on the in-cell stainless steel. The iron

 
 

 

 

 

244

analysis has remained near the lower detectable limit of the analysis indi-
cating no corrosion and the Cr on Ni analysis also indicates no significant
corrosion. Although the chromium and nickel analyses haven't been followed
continuously, any corrosion would have caused an increase in the amount
present. The present chromium analysis of .lUt ppm is equivalent to 0.05
pounds of stainless steel.

One factor which clouds the interpretation of the corrosion results
has been the continual leakage from the system which has required periodic
makeup. The decrease in concentration of inhibitor of 25% in two years
agrees reasonably with the known leakage. An increase of the iron, chrom-
ium, and nickel by the same amount would still indicate a negligible amount

. of corrosion. If corrosion products precipitated as oxides, they would be
caught on the treated water filter. This filter, located in the diesel
house, built up excessive pressure and was cleaned twice during precritical

testing but has not required further cleaning in the past four years.
12.4,10 Recommendations

The biggest problem in the treated water system was the result of the
low design pressure of the thermal shield (20-30 psi). Care should be ta-
ken in future designs that all components withstand the dead~head pressure
of the circulating pump. The piping changes required for protection of the
thermal shield resulted in other parallel flow paths having marginal ca-
pacity.

Consideration should be given to the design of a system which is com-
pletely contained. This would eliminate the need for so many block valves.
Check valves, of the type installed at the MSRE, should not be relied on as
containment block valves. If similar valves are used, they should be in
vertical piping and have sufficient clearances to insure that they will
close when needed.

A corrosion inhibitor should be selected to minimize induced activity.
Provisions for handling gaseous activity such as tritium and radiolytic
hydrogen should be provided. Large components should be shielded or lo-

cated so as to minimize personnel exposure to the induced activity.
 

245

12.5 Condensate System

Building steam condensate has been a very satisfactory supply of de-
mineralized water. The steam is condensed in a stainless steel tube-and-
shell heat exchanger and stored in two stainless steel tanks.

Initially condensate makeup wes added by gravity feed through an auto-
matic level control valve to maintain a constant level in the treated water

surge tank, To obtain better treated water inventory data, this was
changed to periodic manual -additions when the surge tank level decreased
below 50 gal. So :

Condensate. is used to rill feedwater tanks which supply cooling water
for recirculating evaporative cooling of the fuel drain tanks. A corrosion
inhibitor in this service would. .plate out during boiling. The system has
worked well except for 2 occasions when leaking valves between the feedwater
tanks and. steam dome caused accidental addition of water to a steam dome.
At one time the high drain tank temperature (1300°F) interlocks actuated
the supply valves to FD-2 steem dome following a normel drain. This could

have been prevented by turning off electric heaters to the drain tank
shortly after the drain. Due to refluxing, all of the water could not be
removed from the steam dome when cooling was no longer required. To cor-
rect this, a pump and storage drum were installed in the north electric

service area to permit complete drainage of the steam domes when required.

 

12.6 Nuclear Instrument Penetration

Instruments for monitoring nuclear characteristics of the system were
located in & 36-in,-diameter shaft which extended from the high-bay floor
to the inner edge of the thermal shield. This was originally filled with
about 1700 gallons of demineralized water to which a 75-25% mixture of po-

 _tassium nitrite and potassium tetraborate was added to a concentration of

2000 ppm. As with the treated water system, the inhibitor was changed to
‘lithium nitrite-lithium tetraborate to lower the induced activity. Cooling
wes initially by natural circulation but gamma heating when the reactor was
teken to full power increased the water temperature “70°F, This decreased

the neutron attenuation causing a divergence between the indicated nuclear

 

 
i

246

power and the heat balance power. A cooling system using a 5-gpm pump and
a small available heat exchanger were installed which reduced the increase
in water temperature to A18°F end kept the nuclear power measurements and
heat balance calculations within ~5%.

Initially treated water was used for makeup to the nuclear instrument

. penetration. Since the main losses were by evaporation, this caused the

inhibitor concentration to increase. Steam condensate was then used for
water makeup.

Approximately 215 samples were taken of the nuclear instrument pene-
tration water. Most of these were analyzed at the site to assure that ade-
quate treatment was maintained. As in the treated water system, the iron
analysis of samples sent to the leboratory remained near the lower detect-
able limit and the chromium content never exceeded 0.4 ppm indicating very

little corrosion.
12.7 General Water Systems Conclusions

The water systems were quite adequate and as a whole presented very
few problems. The biggest problems resulted from the marginal pressure
rating of the thermal shield and piping error to one of the thermal shield
slides which resulted in the formation of a large gas pocket. The piping
changes required to prevent over-pressurizing the TS and additional equip-
ment needed for gas stripping weakened the performance of the treated water
system.

Corrosion inhibitors in both cooling tower water and treated water
systems proved to be excellent inhibitors but they had undesirable side
effects — the scale and sludge in the CTW system and induced activity and
tritium formation in the TW system.

Equipment and instrumentation performance was very good. The only
equipment troubles were the treated water heat exchanger and brazed tubing
in the cell space coolers. The in-cell water leakage (presumably from the
space cooler brazed fittings), was annoying, but after installation of the
condensate drainage system, did not interfere with performance of the re-

actor.

13. LIQUID WASTE SYSTEM
P. H. Harley

13.1 Description

The liquid waste system consisted of equipment which handled the aque-
ous wastes from the area. Non-hazardous wasts were pumped to small catch
basins and then to a drainage field west of the area. This water was from
building foundation drains and various floor drains in the building, over-
flow from the charcoal bed cell, etc. Hazardous wastes, primarily the
leakage into the reactor cells, and auxiliary cells were pumped or Jetted
to a waste storage tank for sampling and treatment and then transferred to
the Melton Valley Waste Disposal System.

The waste system design included a component decontamination facility
and a water-shielded cell in which maintenance of radioactive components
could be performed. Some of the equipment was installed but as an economy

measure, this section of the system was not completed.

13.2 Preliminary Testing

Piping and tanks were lesk-tested while running performance tests on
the pumps and jet ejectors used to transfer liquids. The liquid waste
‘storage tenk and cell sumps which have bubbler-type level indicators were
calibrated and the ejectors were then tested to remove the water.

No difficulties were encountered with the steam-operated ejectors in
the auxiliary cells but the capacity of the air-power jets in the reactor
and drain-tenk cell was exceedingly Tow. Attempts were made to improve the
performance of the ejectors by changing the venturi diameter but no sig-
nificant improvement wes noted. ‘Back pressure of the long discharge line
limited the Jet cepacity. Modifying piping in the waste cell helped some
but to obtain more capacity, a steam supply was piped to the jet supply
lines at the penetration to the drain-tank cell. Provisions were made to
~ use either air or steam (60 psi) for the jet supply. Water capacity of the
jets using air was 250-350 cc/min end using steam 8.5 gpm. To keep mois-
ture out of the cell, air remained the preferred supply. Co

Although the decontamination facility was not completed, the waste
filter for clarifying shielding water was installed and tested. Filtering

 
 

 

 

248

required pumping 30 gpm through the filter using the waste pump but back-
flushing the filter required "140 gpm. Process water was used for this
operation and the flow was calibrated versus the process water pressure
required (15 psi = 140 gpm).

Initial testing of the waste pump for circulating (mixing) waste tank
contents and transferring was tested satisfactorily but the pump had a ten-
dency to gas bind at low tank levels and process water was required for
priming.

These initial tests were used to check and improve operating proce—

dures as well as test the equipment.
13.3 Operating Experience

The primary aqueous activity found in the MSRE waste has been 3H. A
continuing water leak into the cell since early power operation has been
drained into & condensate collection tank and transferred to the waste tank
at least once a week. The water from the in-cell leak did not collect in
the cell sump. The water evaporated in the 135°F gas in the cell and then
condensed out after being compressed to 6 psig from —2 psig and cooled to
A110°F in the component cooling system gas cooler. This water contained

up to 6 curies/gal. Most of the water in the waste tank was from rain wa-

ter which drained from the ventilation stack and filtered into a collection

tank and was pumped to the waste tank. Although this water could have been

contaminated from material on the filters, very little activity was de-

‘tected. Other sources of contaminated water in the liquid waste were from

the caustic scrubber during fuel processing and wash water from cleaning

the hi-bay floor and auxiliary cells following reactor maintenance periods.

Table 13.1 shows the calculated activity of material transferred to

the Melton Valley Waste Disposal System. The 3H activity correlates to

reactor power fairly well as being one curie of 31 for every 4S Mwh of
power operation,
The equipment in the liquid waste system worked quite well. Some

difficulties were encountered in keeping the building sump level switches

aligned. These were operated by floats with ~5 feet vertical tube which
actuates an ON-OFF switch. Misalignment usually caused the float to "hang"
and the pump would fail to shut off on low water level.

On several occasions, the water level in the charcoal bed cell was
lowered so the inlets to the beds could be heated. This was accomplished
by draining A1500 gal. of water into the sump and allowing the two sump
pumps to pump the water to the catch basin.

During the reactor construction, there was only one building sump pump
and it failed causing the coolant drain cell to flood through a floor drain.
(The CD cell and sump room floor are at the same elevation, 820 ft.) A
small sump was cut into the coolant drain cell floor and-a float-operated
alarm and steam jet were installed. The system was maintained to warn of
failure of both sump pumps end provide the steam jet to keep the sump level
down during a possible electrical power failure.

A second sump pump was ordered to replace the unit which was left from

earlier building operations. Before receiving the new pump, the original

 
 

250

one was overhauled and the new pump was installed to provide an operating
spare. The tritium transferred through this system was ~10% of the dis-

charge from ORNL and no effort was made to limit the rate of discharge.

However, for a large breeder reactor where larger quantities of 3H would

be involved, some control of the tritium release would be required.
If air-operated sump Jets are required in other reactors, care should

be used to insure that the ejJectors have sufficient capacity.

1k, HELIUM LEAK DETECTOR SYSTEM
J. K. Franzreb

14.1 Description and Method of Operation

A leak detector system was used to monitor all flanges in the MSRE
system which could permit. the-escape of radioactive materials. In addition,
all flanges which had to be maintained by remotely-operated tooling were
provided with lesk-detected type Joints to serve as an indication of satis-
factory reassembly. The 119 leask-detected flanges were pressurized with
helium by 65 lines from 8 headers. As shown on Fig. 14-1, some leak-
detector lines were used for more than one flange. The principles of con-
struction of a typical leak~detected flange closure is shown on Fig. 1h-2,

In normel operation, the entire system was interconnected and the
helium supply was valved off. . Periodic repressurization was necessary to
keep the pressure within the limits of 90 to 100 psig. In the event of a
leak, helium flowed into the affected systems and the resultant loss in
pressure in the leak detector headers actuated an alarm in the control room.
If the records indicated that the rate of pressure decrease was greater
than the 0.66-psi/hr erbitrary limit, the headers were isolated to narrow
down the location of the leaking flange. - The leak-detector lines were then
valved off individually or in groups until the location of the leak was de-
termined. A reference volume and a differential pressure transmitter was
provided to aid in isolating leaks and for determining leak rates. The al-
loweble leak rate. from each flange or group of flanges was set at 1 x 10-3

~ ec/sec.
" 1k.2 Calibration

The volumes in the leek detector system were determined by pressuriz-
ing various parts and then. equalizing these unknown quantities of gas with
: an accurately calibrated known volume. The unknown system volumes were
calculated by using the formule PyV, + PyV, = P3(Vy + Vp). Leak rates were
calculated using these volumes and the rate of pressure decay from these
‘sections of the system. The volumes of various parts of the system are

given in Table 14-1.

14.3 Operating Experience

During construction and pre-operating leak testing, some difficulty
was encountered in attaining acceptable leak rates on some flanges, par-
ticularly the very large salt freeze flanges. During this and subsequent
maintenance periods, the leak detector system proved very valusble in
checking the progress and degree of tightness of all flanges.

Operating experience showed that once a flange was made tight, it
stayed tight during service. During the entire life of the MSRE, no leak
ever developed that was serious enough to cause a shutdown of the reactor.

Some problem was posed by a freeze flange (FF-201) located near the
point where the coolant salt left the heat exchanger in the reactor cell.
It leaked more than the maximum allowable rate of 1 x 10-3 cc/sec when salt
was not in the piping and the coolant system had been cooled down. This
leak was measured at about 0.2 cc/sec on August 2, 1966 while the system
was drained and cold. The flange always became acceptably sealed when the
system was heated prior to putting molten salt into the piping and remained
so when the reactor was sat power. The sealing action was probably due to
the thermal expansion of the internals of the flange being greater than

that of the external clamp. This would cause an increase in bearing pres-
sure on the seating surfaces of the metel "O" ring.

During normal operation with the entire system interconnected, the ~
pressure decreased at about 1 psi per day, thus requiring repressurizing

at intervals of one to two weeks. In a 52-day period of system operation
“at temperature in October and November 1968, the pressure decay rate was -
1. 2) psi/day. In a 60-day period of power operation in September and Oc-
tober 1969, the decay rate vas 0. 97 psi/day. During a system cooldown on

~ November 30, 1968, the leak rate did increase to 2.15 psi/hr. Differential
thermal expansion combined. with thermal pressure decay probably caused the
‘high indicated leak rate.

When an abnormal leak rate occurred, it would take about Lk to 8 hours
“to perform an entire survey which consisted of isolating each header and
then each line of the header found to be leaking. Determining the leak
‘rate of an individual line took about an hour or two, however, a rough

check to guide maintenance personnel could be obtained in about 10 minutes.

 
 

 

256

The individual lines, which monitored more than one flange, gave an
interpretation problem. It was not possible to tell at the outset if all
the leak was through one flange or apportioned between multiple flanges on
the same line. When this situation arose, the practice became that of al-
ternately tightening one flange, then the other, incrementally, and running
a combined leak rate on the line between these operations. By observing
when improvement was made, the apportionment of the leak between flanges
could be estimated.

It was necessary to exceed the maximum recommended torque in some in-
stances, The technique was used to overtorque where necessary to seat the
sealing faces, then to loosen the bolts and retorque them to the nominal
or, if necessary, to the maximum value listed in Table 1k4.2. In a few ex-
ceptional cases, it was necessary to exceed this maximum. Some of the
metal O-rings had to be replaced with gold-plated O-rings in order to ob-
tain acceptable leak rates. Some of the 1/2-in. bolts in small flanges
were torqued as high as 150 ft-lbs and operated at about 80 ft-lbs. The
maximum recommended torque was T0 ft-lbs.

The record of measurements of system and flange leak rates was kept
"in a "Leak Detector Log Book" at the LKD control cabinet. Flange leak
rates, plus a record of all work done involving any of these flanges, was
logged in the "MSRE Flange Log" notebook. This latter log gave details on
each flange on a separate page. Information given was Flange No., leak de-
tector Valve No., size of bolts (or in the case of freeze flanges, the
force exerted by the removable clip in tons), ring size, the maximum per-
missible and recommended torque in ft-1bs., the location of the leak de-
tected joint, plus the date of action, the reason for the action, actual

torque applied, and any general comments.
14.4 Discussion and Recommendations

The leak detector system functioned satisfactorily as designed. Due
to the two sealing surfaces on the "O" rings, primary containment was main-
tained as long as the leek detector system overpressure was greater than
any possible pressure that could develop in the primary system. Therefore,
leak rate limitations were set based on convenience in maintaining an ade-

quate overpressure.

Tightening Procedure:

1. Torque bolts to nominal torque value following a crisscross
sequence, Approach final value in successive increments of 10 to
20 ft-1b. :

2. If leak exist, torque bolts to maximum torque value, back off
and retorque to nominal value per step 1.

3. Repeat step 2 as required, increasing nominal value by 10% each
successive step, NEVER EXCEED MAXIMUM VALUES without permission of the
MSRE Operations or Maintenance Chief.

 
 

 

258

Remote welding or brazing techniques should be used where maintenance
is infrequent. This should be more economical and would reduce the number
of details to be handled by the operating personnel.

When opening primary system flanges, it is desirable to have the leak
detector vented to atmospheric pressure to minimize the spread of activity.
Each header should have a line which is connected to the cell to facilitate

doing this since the gas in the line could be contaminated.

15. ‘INSTRUMENT. AIR SYSTEM
T. L. Hudson

15:1 Description

The instrument air system supplied clean, dry, compressed air for
pneumatic instruments and other special uses. Two Joy compressors, AC-1
and AC-2, were used to compress the air, which then passed through an after-
cooler and entrainment separator to a common line supplying two parallel
receiving tanks. From the receiving tanks, the air passed through one of
two parsllel drying stations containing Trinity heatless dryers. The dry
air was distributed through headers to locally mounted filter and reducing
stations. The service air. compressor, AC-3, could be valved into the in-

strument air system upstream of the receiver tanks if required.
15.2 Operating Experience

The capacity of the instrument air system with one air compressor in
operation was adequate at all times. Normal air usage was about TO scfm.
Of this amount, 18 scfm was used for purging the instrument air dryers, -
12 scfm for supplying noncritical instruments, and 40 scfm for supplying

-the ‘eritical instruments. The critical instruments were supplied by the
emergency instrument air supply, which consisted of two banks of six ni-
trogen cylinders, when the normal instrument air supply was lost.
The capacity of the emergency instrument air supply was tested during
normal operation with flush salt to assure an orderly shutdown of the re-
actor in case of loss of both instrument air compressors (see MSRE Test
Report 2.3.11.3). With an emergency air usage of 40 scfm and one bank of
cylinders at their lowest operating, 1500 psig (initial low-pressure alarm
point) and the other bank full (n2000 psig) at the time both air compressors
stop would provide the following times:

(1) Air in the compressor surge tank would last ~b min.

(2) First bank of nitrogen cylinder (if used to T00 psig — at this
pressure the control valve stopped controlling) would last 13 min.

(3) Subsequent full banks of nitrogen cylinder (if used to T00 psig)
would last “20 min.

 
 

260

From the test it was concluded that the emergency instrument air system
was adequate. It would have been necessary to install a larger control
valve to more fully utilize the nitrogen cylinders.

Legks in the emergency nitrogen headers were repaired several times
and the control valve was repaired once. On the average one bank of nitro-
gen. was changed out every two weeks to keep the cylinders above the initial

alarm pressure of 1500 psig.
15.3: Conclusions

~The operation of the normal instrument air system was very satis-

factory. At no time was it necessary to use the emergency nitrogen system
during operation of the reactor. One instrument air compressor was oper-
ated with the other in standby except for during repairs or maintenance.
Even with a complete power outage, it was possible to start one air com-
pressor on diesel power before the receiver tank pressure dropped enough

to cause a transfer to the emergency system. Although some extensive main-
tenance was done on the air’ compressors, only one was ever inoperative at oO

a time.

"16. ELECTRICAL SYSTEM“ ~ -
T. L, Hudson: Ce

16.1 Description

The MSRE electrical power was supplied from the ORNL substation by:
either of two 13.8-kV TVA lines, a preferred line or an alternate. These
vere separated by two interlocked. pole-mounted motor-operated line -switches.,
"Automatic transfer was porvided from the preferred line to the alternate
line. Both transfer switches could be manually operated remotely from the
auxiliary control room.

The ac power entered the MSRE building through two transformer sub-
stations. ~A 1500-kVse, 480-V, 3-phase substation served the process equip-
ment, and a T50-kVa, 480-V, 3-phase auxiliary station was initially for
building services, such as lighting, ventilation, etc. After the process
substation became overloaded, bus 5 which supplies electrical heaters was
connected to the suxiliary system. Three diesel-generators were installed
for emergency ac use.

There were two separate area dc systems, a 48-V system and a 250-V
system. These were normally operated by ac-dc motor-generator sets and
had battery supplies for emergency use.

The 48-V dec system provided power for electrical controls and one
channel of the reactor safety systems. The system consists of two 3-kW
motor-generator sets (each rated at 53 ampere at 56 V) and a bank of 48-V
batteries (600 amp-hr). The two generators normally supplied the dc power
and charged the batteries. In an emergency, when no ac power was available
to run the motor-generators, 48-V'de power was supplied directly from the
batteries. IE |

The 250-V dc system provided power to the relisble power system, pro-
cess breakers trip power, 13.8-kV transfer control power, and emergency
lighting. The system consisted of one 125-kW motor-generator set and a
bank of 240-V batteries (364 amp-hr).

The reliable power system provided power to certain important process
equipment and one channel of the safety systems. Initially, the pover was

supplied from a 25-kW dc-ac motor-generator set. The dec motor was supplied

 
 

262

from the 250-V dc system and the generator supplied the 120/240-V ac re-
lisble power system. The operation of the MG set was unreliable because
of failures in electrical control components and was replaced with a static
inverter (see 16.4). }

The MSRE electrical installation made extensive use of the electrical
facilities that were installed for the ARE and ART operations in the T7503
area, Many modifications.were made to the existing equipment, but only a

limited amount of supplementel equipment was required.

16.2 Alternating Current System

The operation of the ac electrical system was very satisfactory. There
were eleven important failures, ten of which caused unscheduled interrup-
tions in the power operation of the reactor:. five were. caused by electrical
storms, one by a cable failure at ea component-cooling pump, one by an over-
load of the main process-power breaker, one by en arc between a 13.8-kV line
and an activator rod to the line fuse, one by a failure of the main trans-
former primary fuse, one by a failure of the auxiliary transformer primary

fuse, and one by a failure of the drain-tank space cooler motor. These
| interruptions varied in. length from & few minutes to several days. In all
cases the necessary repairs or modifications were made, and no damage to
reactor equipment was incurred. These are discussed in more detail below.

On two occasions while the reactor was operating at power, momentary
electrical outages during storms caused control-rod screms by renge-
switching the nuclear power safety channels because of dips in the fuel-
pump-motor current. In both these cases the nuclear power was quickly re-

_ stored to the value that existed Just prior to the outage. Since the
safety analysis indicated that low range of the safety channels was needed
only while filling the reactor (when the fuel pump wes off), rapid response
~ of the range-switching ves not required. Therefore, time-deley relays were
subsequently incorporated in these circuits to prevent their activation on
momentary power dips. | .

- Another storm-induced failure occurred when lightning struck the main
ORNL power substation and parted one wire of the normal MSRE feeder. In

this case the electrical load was automatically transferred to an alternate
263

feeder, and all essential equipment was restarted in time to prevent drain-
ing either the fuel or coolant system. However, operation at high nuclear
power could not be resumed until service was restored on the main feeder.
The entire 13.8-kV supply system was subsequently reviewed and improved to
make it less susceptible to damage by storms.

During a thunderstorm in June 1967, the reactor operation was inter-
rupted by the loss of both feeders. The reactor period safety system func-
tioned properly and scremmed the reactor but two amplifiers were damaged.
Approximately 32 hours later, the reactor was returned to critical operation
after the period safety amplifiers had been repaired.

In July 1967, an interruption was caused by the loss of the preferred
feeder during another thunderstorm. Emergency power from the diesel gener-
ators was in service within 2 min, and low-power nuclear operation was re-
suned in about’'13 min. After repairs had been completed on the preferred
feeder, full-power operation was resumed in approximately 6 hr.

The short in the component-cooling pump cable seal is described in
Sect, 10 entitled "Component Cooling System." When this short occurred,
there was a massive flow of current and the breeker supplying the entire
bus tripped before the individual bresker for the motor.

During the initial full-power operation of the reactor, the main
process-power bresker (breaker R) was loaded to near its setpoint value.
When the load on the coolant-radiator mein-blower motors was increased by
increasing the pitch on the blower fen blades, the increased load on
breaker R caused it to trip on overcurrent. This condition was relieved
by transferring bus 5 (v200 kW) from the main process transformer to the
euxiliary power transformer, The load transfer decreased the current
through breeker R from about 1700 amp/phase to about 1550.

A building power failure occurred on a foggy morning in October 1967,
when an arc developed between a 13.8-kV line to the main transformer for
the building and parallel metal activator rod to the 13.8-kV line fuse.-
The cause of the arc is unexplained. Although the weather was foggy, it
was not unusually wet. This fault caused the operation of the preferred
feeder overcurrent ground relay located at the ORNL substation, vhich
tripped the feeder bresker before the line overcurrent relay located at the

MSRE could operate to prevent an automatic transfer to the alternate feeder.

 
 

 

264

When the MSRE was transferred, the alternate feeder overcurrent ground Te-
lay. operated and the alternate feeder bresker also tripped. (To prevent
an automatic transfer to the alternate feeder on a similar fault, an over-
current ground relay was later installed at the MSRE.) After an interrup-
tion of 37 min, low-power nuclear operation was resumed on emergency elec-
trical power from the diesel generators. The damage was repaired, the
spacing between the line and the activator rod was increased, and normal
service was restored after an interruption of 2 hr. .

In April 1969, there was a failure of a fuse on the primary side of
the MSRE main power transformer. This resulted in the loss of voltage on
one of the transformer windings. The power. supply was changed from a three-
phase to a single-phase supply. This caused a drop in secondary voltage
across two windings and increase in voltage across the other winding. - The
motor-operated equipment continued to operate until the individual breakers
were tripped by the high current in two of the lines. All breakers did not
trip at the. same time vhich made it difficult to locate the trouble im-
mediately. The reactor was scrammed from full power and the diesel gener-
ators were started, but both the fuel and coolant systems were drained
. before cooling air could be restored to the freeze valves. No apparent
_. cause for the fuse failure was found other than possible overheating from
| poor electrical contacts.

About the middle of February 1966, a » ground developed in the drain-tank
cell space cooler 10-hp motor after about 2900 hr of operation. An iso-
lation transformer was installed to isolate the ground from the electrical
system. After a few hours of operation, the motor stopped and couldn't be
restarted. The reactor was taken subcritical and the fuel system was
drained. The drain-tank cell was opened to provide cell cooling. The
cooler and motor were removed, and examination showed that the rotor had
slipped. along the shaft until the rotor fan blades rubbed, causing the
stator windings: to be destroyed. The failure appeared to be due to im-
proper manufacture and not e design weakness. Therefore, the damaged motor
wes replaced with one prectically identical.
| On one occasion the suxiliery power system was out of service for
ebout 2 hrs due to a failure of the auxiliary power transformer primary

fuse... During the fuse replacement the operation of the reactor continued
265

at power with bus 5 supplied from diesel-generator 5. The fuse failure
apparently was caused by overheating from poor electrical contact. Due to
low resistance readings, the three auxiliary power transfers were replaced

in 1968.

16.3 250-V_dc System

The operation of this system has been very satisfactory. There have
been some tube failures in the sutometic voltage control system for the
generator, but each time the unit: was operated on manual control until the
tubes in the automatic controls could be replaced.

Once a month the charging voltage was increased to 275 V for 24 hrs to
give the batteries an equalizing charge,

The batteries were given a 3~hr life test under full load. The vol-
tage dropped to 215 volts over the three-hour period. Extrapolating the
voltage curve indicated that the lower limit of 210-V would have been
reached in "3.5 hours which is well above the 2-hr life upon which the de-

sign was based.

16.4 Relisble Power System

The 120-V ac reliable power system was originally supplied by an MG
set. In early operation, this MG set (originally installed for the ARE)
proved very unreliable due to failures in the electrical control components.
To improve the reliability and increase the capacity, the motor generator
was replaced with a new 62-kVa. three-phase static inverter. The total load
on the reliable power supply, including the on-line computer, which has
some three-phase load, was 40 kVa. The static inverter offered a number
of -advantages over the old rotary inverter, including higher efficiency
(increased 35%), smaller size, no moving parts, quiet operation, and ex-
cellent voltage and frequency regulation. Prior to the installation of

“this equipment, both the capacity and voltage regulation of the reliable
power supply were inadequate for the operation of the on-line computer.
During the checkout and testing of the static inverter in April 1966

after the installation had been completed, trouble occasionally developed

 
 

266

that blew the load fuses. Two times the manufacturer's field engineer made
exhaustive tests and could not find any trouble, but all symptoms indicated
that the trouble was in the low-voltage logic power supply, which supplies
24-V dc control power. On April 25, the inverter failed again while the
reactor was operating at low power. Apparently the transfer caused a tran-
sient on the ac system, thus also dropping out the rod scram relay supplied
from the ac system, causing a control rod scram. The inverter load was
automatically transferred to the normal ac power supply. After this failure
a8 new power-supply module was installed. oo

The inverter output voltage regulation was 208 + 1/2 v, and the output
frequency better than 60 cps + 0. 01%. The inverter was tested for 2-1/4 hr
operating from the 250-V battery system without the dc generator operating.
Although the Loput to the inverter veried 20 v, the output varied only
0.5 V.

There have been three other failures associated with the static in-
verter that have automatically transferred the normal inverter load to TVA
supply. The first was caused by failure of load fuses which resulted in an
unscheduled control-rod scram. The second was caused by a failure of a
thyrister in the inverter logic circuit. The third was caused by a momen-
tary ground during maintenance on the computer.

When a transfer occurred, many alarms were received in the control
room. Some were caused by loss of operating equipment, and others were
due to the momentary loss of control voltage to certain monitors. These
had to be reset to stop the alarm and control action. After the second
inverter failure, all operating equipment was restarted, but an emergency
fuel drain occurred before the reactor-cell air activity monitors were re-
set. No drain or other serious condition resulted from the .other inverter

failures,

16.5 LUB8-V dc System

The 48-V.dc system was very relisble. The only maintenance on the
system was caused by excessive arcing of the generator brushes. Initially
one generator was operated near rated capacity to supply the load. Filters

and viewing windows were installed on the generators end both generators
 

267

were operated in parallel to reduce the individual generator current after
the load slightly exceeded. the capacity of one generator. These changes
‘greatly reduced the generator brush problems,”

Once a month, the charging voltage was increased to Sh volts for n8 hr
to give the batteries an equalizing charge. =

The batteries were given a 6-hr life test. The first 3.5 hr was at
47.5 amps and the last 2.5 hr at 19.5 amps. The batteries expended 215
amp-hour of the 600 amp-hour life with essentially no voltage drop.

16.6 Diesel Generators

The three diesel-power generators, each with a capacity of 300 kW,
supplied emergency ac power to motors and heaters in the MSRE. They proved
to be quite reliable. They were started and operated unloaded for about an
hour each week. Once a month they were tested under load. They never
failed to start when required during a power outage. Under emergency con-
ditions, they were usually running within 2 min after a failure of the nor-
mal power supply.

In February 1966, a crack was found in the block of DG-3 at one of
the bolt holes. Attempts at repairs were not successful, but the unit was
operable. Later DG-3 was: replaced with a surplus diesel generator from
another facility. The replacement unit was similar to the original except

that it was started by compressed air instead of by an electric starter.

16.7 100-kVa Variable Frequency Motor-Generator Set

A temporary installation of a used varisble frequency MG set was made
at the MSRE to supply the fuel-pump motor during special tests. The fuel-
pump motor was operated from 610 rpm to 1165 rpm (maximum speed with MG
set) over a period of several weeks.

The automatic controls for the variable speed and generator voltage
did not work properly during the initial checkout using a dummy resistance
load. After replacement of some'defective components in the control cir-
cuits, the fuel pump was operated from the MG set. The operation of the

.automatic controls were still not completely satisfactory and some manual

 
 

 

 

268

adjustments were required. Frequently the fuel-pump motor was ‘stopped be-
cause of over adjustment of the manual controls. Also during the lower-
speed operation, the speed of the fuel pump was not constant enough to make
the desired tests. Therefore, the sutomatic controls were bypassed and -
manual controls of speed and voltage were installed. Satisfactory operes
tion with manual controls was not obtained until the fuel pump wes operated
at about 35 V above rated voltage, assuming the fuel-pump motor voltage is

directly proportional to speed.

16.8 Conclusion

Considering the age and the number of modifications made to the exist-
ing electrical system within the MSRE building, the performance has been
very satisfactory. The main weakness of the entire electrical system was
with the 13.8-kV feeders and transformers supplying the MSRE, Most of the
equipment was over 15 years old. - During 1966, there were three momentary
interruptions of the power to the MSRE caused by thunderstorms. The entire
13.8-kV supply system was reviewed and improved to meke it less susceptible
to damage by storms. Since the improvements were made, there have been

only two interruptions due to storms in the last three years of operation.

17. HEATERS
T. L, Hudson

17.1 Description

Electrical heaters were provided for all parts of the salt system to
permit preheating of the circulating loops and to maintain the temperature
of the salt at 1200°F during zero-power operation. (In practice the
heaters were kept energized during power operation as well.) The total in-
stalled capacity was A900 kW; the actual power requirement was less than
half this amount. It was possible to supply all heaters essential to an
orderly shutdown, including enough to keep thy salt molten in the drain
tanks, from a 300-kW diesel-driven generator. A summary of the heaters
and insulation on the salt systems is given in Table 17.1.

The type of installation was determined by the location. In the re-
actor and drain-tank cells, radiation from long-lived fission products pre-
cluded direct maintenance after start of power operation. There, the heat-
ers were designed for removal and replacement using long-handled tools in-
serted through the cell roof. In the coolant cell, the piping could be
approached within a few minutes after a shutdown, and the heaters and insu-
lation were the conventional type used in component test facilities. -

Removable heater units in the reactor and drain-tank cells were of two
types. On the piping and heat exchanger, the heaters were nichrome ele-
ments in ceramic plates, located on the inner surfaces of the removable
units that also insulated the sides and top of the equipment. On the re-
actor vessel, fuel pump, and drain tanks, the removable heaters were in-
serted into penetrations in permanently mounted insulation. All electrical
insulation was ceramic type, because of the high gamma-radiation fields (up
to 105 R/h in the reactor cell during operation).

Thermal insulation in the removable heater-insulation units was of the
metallic, multiple-layer, reflective type, which could withstand handling
without dusting. The permanently mounted insulation was low=-conductivity,
high temperature low sullfur content, ceramic fiber of expanded silica,

with a thin metal sheet between the insulation and the pipe surfaces (see

ORNL Drawing E-MM-B-51676).

Maintenance requirements were minimized by designing the heaters with
excess capacity and operating them at reduced voltage. If some of the
heater elements failed, the other elements could be operated at a higher
voltage or the power could be increased to the adjacent heaters. Heater
units that were less accessible had spare heater elements installed and -
connected, ready for use with only minor, out-of-cell wiring changes.

Control of the electrical input to the heaters was entirely manual, in
response to system temperatures displayed on either a multipoint tempera-
ture recorder or a cathode-ray tube by a multipoint scanner. At least one
thermocouple was attached to the piping or equipment under each heater unit,

with additional couples at potential cold spots.

17.2 Preoperational Checkout

To assure that the heaters would perform properly and to provide ref-
erence data for future trouble-shooting, a number of tests were done before
and after installation. A visual examination of the heaters and the wiring
in the Junction boxes was made and all obvious errors were corrected. Con-
tinuity checks were completed and measurements of the heater circuit re-
sistances and resistances to ground were recorded. Each heater circuit was
then energized individually to assure that the proper thermocouple or ther-
mocouples responded.

The effective resistance of each heater circuit was calculated and
these were compared with measured resistance of the heaters before and af-
ter being installed in the cell. Several of the resistance measurements
were made using & volt-ohm-meter but the accuracy of these readings was usu-
ally not good enough. The final resistance measurements were made with a
wheatstone bridge and were recorded to the nearest one-hundredth ohm.

Table 17.2 is a summary of repairs made to the heaters during the pre-

operational checkout.

17.3 System Heatup

The heatup of the coolant, fuel, and drain tank systems was started as
soon as construction and checkout of the systems were completed. During

the first heatup, all heaters operated satisfactorily and there were no

heater failures, but there were a few areas where the temperature was low
because of air leskage and lack of thermal insulation. These areas were
the inlet to the fuel-pump furnace, north end of heat exchanger, transfer
line entrance to the drain-tank furnace, and the coolant radiator. After
the air leakage was reduced and thermal insulation installed, satisfactory
temperatures were obtained with the heaters as installed. The voltage set-
ting required for each heater was determined during the startup testing and
stops were set to limit the controls to hold the system temperatures to
1300°F or. below, . The general heatup of the systems and the difficulties
are discussed in the following three sections.

17.3.1 Coolant and Coolant Drain Tank Systems Heatup. .

The initial heatup of the coolant system in. the coolent cell and :cool-

 

ent ‘drain cell was started on.October 13, 1964, The coolant pump was run
during the hestup with normal helium purge and the heaters were adjusted
to limit the heatup. rate. to gbout 100°F/hr. Heaters located in the cell
penetration sleeves on lines 200 and 201 were operated at a reduced set-
ting to provide a temperature gradient until the heatup of the reactor cell
was started so as to reduce the thermsl stresses at the anchor point.
Heater and thermocouple leads on top of the radiator enclosure were
observed to be overheating as the system was being leveled at a reference
temperature of 350°F, The radiator was cooled to ambient temperature and:
a section of the top of the radiator was found that had not been insulated.
The insulation was installed and. a second heating of the radiator was
started. Some of the radiator heaters were disconnected in an unsuccessful
effort to achieve a satisfactory temperature distribution. - The radiator
was 1073 to 1245°F and the outlet tubes were 620 to 1000°F. This condition
_ was ‘reached nine days after the heatup was started. During this time the
remainder of the coolant system in the coolant cell was heated to 1047 to
1259°F except on line 202 between the radiator and the coolant pump. There
was LOO°F difference among temperatures slong this section of line under a
single heater control. The spread was reduced to about 175°F by replacing
part of the permanent insulation near the radiator outlet to reduce inleak-
age. -The coolant drain tank wes heated to about 1200°F without any diffi-
culty with a temperature difference of 30°F between the highest and lowest

thermocouple reading. ’

 
 

 

276

The radiator was cooled to room temperature for inspection and to re-
pair the doors and seals. After repairs were made, the radiator was again
heated. With the best temperature distribution obtained, there was about
a 500°F spread on the radiator outlet tubes. This indicated that a rela-
tively large heat leak existed. An inspection wes made of the radiator
enclosure near the outlet heater end six compartments .in the enclosure wall
were found to be without insulation. After the proper insulation was in-
stalled and gaps in the vicinity of the outlet piping were caulked, satis-
factory temperatures were obtained with all heaters in service as origi-
nally designed. Localized overheating in the areas above the radiator en-
closure was again observed. The heat leaks were primarily et openings
through which the ceramic-besded insulated electrical leads entered the
enclosure, Some minor insulation damage was sustained on the wiring inside
the junction boxes mounted sbout 12 inches above the top of the radiator
enclosure. )

During the following shutdown, late in 1965, radiator doors of im-
proved design were installed. Heat losses due to air leekage around the
doors continued to present a problem. To obtain an scceptable temperature
distribution, it was necessary to shim the gaskets and disconnect some of
‘the heaters, so as to give a non-uniform heat input over the face of the
radiator. ‘When the main blowers. were operated to test the doors, other
difficulties became apparent. One of these was leakage of hot air into the
region Just above the radiator enclosure which caused overheating of elec-
trical insulation on the numerous thermocouples and heater leads in junction
boxes located in this vicinity. It was necessary to relocate Junction boxes
in cooler locations along the cell wall and install higher temperature elec-
trical insulation on the thermocouple end heater leads over the enclosure.

During “the approach to full reactor power, heating the empty radiator
to an acceptable temperature distribution prior to a fill hed become in-
creasingly difficult, and on the last fill, some of the tubes could not be
heated sbove the melting point of salt until the radiator was filled and
éirculation was started. After the shutdown in July 1966, the radiator
door seals were modified. The electrical heat required to heat the empty
radiator was reduced from 108 kW to 62 kW by the door seal modification.

1
 

277

The four flow transmitters located in the enclosure above the radiator
required a higher heater setting when either or both blowers were on be-
cause of air leakage past the transmitter.

17.3.2 Fuel System Heatup

The initial heatup of the fuel system and the coolant piping in the
reactor cell was started November 1, 1964. At this time the coolant system
in the coolant cell had already been heated.

About nine days were spent on the first heatup and leveling of the
temperatures. The heatup rate was limited by the heatup rate of the re-
actor because there is about 8000 pounds of INOR and 8000 pounds of graph--
ite to be heated. To aid in heating up the graphite and to help purge out
any remaining oxygen, the fuel pump was run during the heatup with normal
helium purge. Also the fuel system piping and heat exchanger were operated
about 150°F higher to help heat up the reactor.

The system temperatures were brought up to an acceptable range (1000
to 1250°F) with a few exceptions. Temperature at the freeze flanges and
on the coolant lines at the cell penetrations were, as expected, below the
liquidus temperature of the salt, but only over short sections. Thermo-
couples under the heater located between freeze flange 100 and the fuel-
pump furnace could be heated only to 700 to 900° until heat losses were
reduced by closing gaps in the heater base. There was about 300°F spread
between the coolant inlet nozzle and the fuel outlet nozzle on the heat
exchanger. The spread was reduced by closing gaps between the heat-exchanger
base and adjacent heater. The time required to heat up the reactor and fuel
system after the initial heatup was about three days.

17.3.3 Fuel Drain Tank System Heatup

The initial heatup of the drain-tank cell was started November 12,

‘1964, This heatup included drain tanks, FD-1, FD-2, FFT, and lines 103,
104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, and 110. This was the last of the systems
heated.

The helium purge was set up from the fuel system through line 103 to

the drain-tank system and then exhausted at line 110.
The heaters were adjusted to limit the heatup rate to less than
100°F/hr. All of the system was heated to an acceptable range (1000 to

 
 

 

278

1250°F) except where lines (lines 107, 108, and 109) penetrated the tank
furnaces. On line 107, the temperature was brought up to 950°F, but only
by operating the heaters in the penetration at 220% of their rating. The
other two line penetrations were somewhat better, but still unsatisfactory.
The insulation on these lines near the penetrations was removed. Then the
heaters were tied cldser to the pipes and additional insulation was insert-
ed between the heaters and the furnace walls, Temperatures at these pene-
trations then reached 1200°F with the heaters at less than their rated

capacity.

17.4 Heater Performance

The system was operated at high temperature for about 10 months before
the prepower shutdown. During the first 1500 hr of operation, only two
heater elements failed. Both of these were in removable heater units on
the main fuel circulating lines and had spare elements in the ceramic heat-
er plates. The spare elements were put into service by out-of-cell wiring
changes. A summary of the heater failures and repairs, are included in
Tables 17.3, 17. 4, and 17.5. Six additional heater-element failures and
an electrical ground at a disconnect were discovered during the cheékout
for Run 2. In four of the heaters, the failures occurred at the junction
of the extension lead and the heater element inside the ceramic. plate.
These elements and the electrical ground were repaired before startup, and
the other two elements were left out of service for Runs 2 and 3.

During subsequent operation, one in-cell heater failure was noted, and
one failure occurred at a heater power supply. (The latter was repaired
immediately.) It may be noted that a number of heater failures could occur
without significantly affecting the operation of the reactor system.

Three more heater-element failures were found during the prepower shut-
down. In addition, a number of minor defects (grounds, damaged connectors)
were found. All the defects, including those left from earlier operations,
were corrected. )

An important cause of ceramic heater-element failure has been separa-
tion of the extension lead from the heater element. This is apparently

due to a combination of a design weakness and excessive flexing during

installation of the elements. The joint was redesigned and new elements,
which incorporate the change, were installed when such failures occurred.

Two fuel-pump heater units resistance increased from 12 to 17 ohms.
These were removed from the reactor cell and the mechanical joint between
the heater solid and flexible nickel extension lead was found to be highly
oxidized. All five fuel-pump heater units were removed from the reactor
cell and a welded connection was made at each lead extension. No other
trouble was encountered with these heaters.

Before and during the prepower shutdown, direct maintenance was per-
formed on the heaters in the reactor and drain-tank cell.

17.4.2 During Power Operation

All heaters performed properly during the heatup of the fuel and
coolant loops in December 1965 for the start of power operation, with one
minor exception. There was a broken lead on a heater between the radiator
and the coolant pump. It was simply reconnected. After the startup, one
of three groups of elements in one of the heat-exchanger heater units
failed. No action was taken at this time because the other elements were O
enough to produce the desired temperature. A summary of the heater failures
and repairs made during power operation is included in Tables 17.3, 1T7.k,
and 17.5. | | |

During the shutdown in September 1966, a resistance check was made on.
all in-cell heaters at junction boxes located outside the reactor and
drain-tank cell and compared with initial resistances. Other than the
heat-exchanger heater, only one heater was found that had failed. This was
‘one of three installed spare heaters on the vertical section of pipe under
the heat exchanger. No repairs were required, since there is adequate ca-
pacity in the other heaters on this section of pipe.

The resistance of the coolant-system heaters located outside of the
reactor cell was also checked. Five heaters were found that had failed.
One was on the radiator, one on the coolant system 5-in. piping, one on the
coolant-pump furnace, one in the radiator outlet header, and the other one,
a spare heater, was on the fill-line piping. The heaters on the 5-in.
piping and on the radiator were replaced, there was adequate heater ca-

pacity at the other locations. { |
 

 

285

Aside from heater-element failures, a remote disconnect for one of
the fuel-pump heaters was damaged during remote operation associated with
the thawing of a salt plug in the fuel-pump offgas line. The heater was
plugged into a space disconnect to restore it to service.

By the last of October 1966, all of the heater elements in one of the
heat-exchanger heater units had failed. Satisfactory heat-exchanger tem-
peratures were maintained without this heater, even with the fuel loop emp-
ty. However, continuous circulation of the coolant salt was maintained
until after Run 11, so the full effect of the heater failure could not be
determined. Tests were performed with both the fuel and coolant loops
empty after Run 11 to determine the need for this heater in preheating the
system from a cold condition. When helium circulation was stopped in the
fuel system, the temperature distribution was satisfactory for a fill with-
out the heater operating. With helium circulation in the fuel system, one
temperature decreased to below 800°F. Since satisfactory temperatures
could be achieved without it, the failed heater was not repaired at this
time. .
‘While the reactor system was being heated up for Run 13, Heater FV-103
was lost by an open circuit. This 1.5-kW bent-tubular-type heater normally
supplies about 200 W of heat to a LU-in. section of the fuel drain line
within the reactor vessel furnace, between the freeze valve and the
resistance-heated section of the line, The purpose of the heater was to
help control the temperature profile through the freeze valve, After the
heater failed, tests with flush salt showed that by proper adjustment of
the cooling air controls, the freeze valve could be maintained reliably
with thaw times in an. acceptable range. (Thaw time was around 12 min when
the reactor vessel was at 1180°F and the center of the freeze valve was at
L495°F,) Therefore, this heater was not replaced.

In December 1967, a lead to the adjacent failed heat-exchanger heater

-. opened, thereby reducing the output of this heater by 50%. A week later a

second partial failure further reduced.the output to only 33% of normal.
Although these failures did not affect operations as long as salt was kept
circulating, the lack of heat in the two adjacent heaters made it necessary

to repair them during the shutdown afte/ Run li. These two units were

 
 

 

286

removed from the reactor cell early in the shutdown (on the fourth and
fifth day after the end of full-power operation) to see if repairs were
possible or if replacement units would be required. The trouble was found
in the Junction boxes mounted on top of the heaters, where the lead wires
from several of the heater elements had burned in two at their screwed con-
"nections to the terminal strips. Repair was complicated by the induced ac-
tivity in the assemblies, which produced a gamma radiation field of about
3 R/hr at 1 ft. A temporary work shield was set having concrete block walls
and a top of steel plate and lead block. Direct maintenance on the junc-
tion was done through a small opening in the top: The terminal strips and
connections were severely oxidized, apparently due to high temperatures
during operation. This situation was corrected by installing nickel term-
inal strips and welding the heater leads directly to them. The copper wire
from the terminal strip to the disconnect was also replaced with No. 12
nickel wire welded to the terminal strip. Aside from the damage in the
Junction boxes, both heat-exchanger heaters were in good condition, and
~ after the repairs, both were reinstalled through the maintenance shield
without unusual difficulty. -
After the units were. reinstalled in the cell, it was found that the
current on one phase of south end unit was zero. This proved to be due to
a fault in the permanently mounted lead wire in the cell.: The fault was
circumvented by installing e& jumper cable between the heater disconnect and
a spare disconnect. The heaters functioned satisfactorily during the sub=-
sequent heatup of the system.

One of the elements in the heater unit on line 106 adjacent to the
Junction of line 103 with lines 104, 105, and 106 failed during the middle
of January 1967. "This was not replaced since it was possible to maintain
adequate temperature using the other elements and adjacent heaters.

There have been three failures of radiator headers due to broken nickel
lead wires. The leads look like the nickel had crystallized. Several bro-
ken ceramic bushings have been replaced.

The heater located on the south end of the heat exchanger developed a
partial ground in the latter part of October 1968. In order to clear the

ground detector lights on Bus 5, the heater was taken out of service. This
 

 

 

 

287

was possible because tests had been performed after Run 11 which determined
that this heater was not essential for preheating the system from a cold
condition. The cause of the ground was suspected to be ‘a broken ceramic
bead on the lead wire between a heater element and the junction box mounted
on top of the unit.

About a 30% drop in current on one heater on the fuel line between the
reactor and the fuel pump (H-100-1) occurred late in September 1968. After
a resistance check indicated a side heater element had failed, the spare
heater elements were placed in service.

About a 30% drop in current on the heater on the fuel line between the
heat exchanger and the reactor (H-102-5) occurred in the early part of Aug-
ust 1969. After a resistance check indicated that one of the three heater
-elements had failed, the spare heater elements were placed in service.

The individual ammeters for each heater circuit were read and recorded
daily. Since operation started, most heater failures caused a sufficient
change in ammeter reading so as to be noticed. Variation in voltage sup-
"plied to the MSRE was usually less than 2% over a 24-hour period. A total
2% change caused less than a 2°F/hr change of the system temperature under
isothermal conditions. This was easily adjusted by changes in heater set-
tings. After the system had been brought to equilibrium at temperature it
was not usually necessary to make - further adjustments. Typical heater data
including power requirements for 1200°F isothermal conditions are given in
Table 17.6. - |

The four types of failures experienced with the heater leads are given

in Table 17.7 along with methods used to make repairs.

17.5 Systems Cooldown Rate

‘Before nuclear power operation was started, system cooldown tests were
run to determine the effects on the system if electrical power was lost.
The cooldown of the fuel and coolant systems was done simultaneously since
. these are connected at the heat exchanger. These tests which were done
“with the radiator doors closed did not show any difficulties. A much more
serious condition occurred on two occasions after nuclear pover operation

was started when the cold radiator doors were scrammed and the coolant pump

stopped. Salt was frozen in some of the radiator tubes but was succesfully
melted out with no apparent damsge to the radiator. These coolant tests
and radiator difficulties are discussed in the following four sections.
17.5.1 Fuel and Coolant Systems Cooldown Rate, Radiator Door Closed
Three cooldown tests were run. In the first test, the cooldown rate

was determined for the fuel and coolant systems with salt circulating in

) both systems and with all the reactor and coolant cell heaters off except
~

the heaters on the fill lines. The fuel and coolant system reference tem—
perature dropped from 1160 and 1169°F to 1105 and 1115°F respectively in
one hour and 52 min. This is a cooldown rate of 0, 5°F/min.

In the second test, the same heaters were off as in the first test and

‘the fuel and coolant pumps. were turned off. After ten minutes, the radi-

‘ator heaters and the fuel and coolant pumps were turned back on. This sim-

ulated a power failure followed by the startup of the diesel generators.
The fuel and coolant system reference temperatures dropped from 1156 and
1185°F to 1089 and 1112°F respectively in 2 hours and 50 minutes. This is
a cooldown rate of 0.4°F/min.

In the third test, all the heaters and the fuel and coolant pumps were
turned off and remained off for the duration of the test. The reference
temperatures dropped from 1150 and 1170°F to 1120 and 1141°F respectively
for the fuel and coolant system in 38 minutes. This is a cooldown rate of
0.8°F/min. The reference temperature on the radiator dropped from 1170 to
1090°F in the seme period. This is a cooldown rate of 2.1°F/min.

In all three tests the temperatures of the coolant float level indi-.
cators dropped rapidly and their heaters were turned back on.

17.5.2 ‘Fuel Drain Tank Cooldown Rate -

With flush salt in FD-2, a test was made of the cooldown rate by turn-
ing off all FD-2 heaters. The average temperature at the start of the test
was 1085°F., Ten and one-half hours later, the average temperature was 1020°F,
From this data, it is estimated that it would take at least 56 hours for
FD-2 to cool down from 1200°F to 850°F upon loss of electrical power to the
tank heaters. Decay heating would extend this time,
 

 

 

 

291

17.5.3 Coolant Drain Tank Cooldown Rate

With coolant salt in CDT, a test was made of the cooldown rate by
turning off all CDT heaters. The average temperature of five thermocouples
dropped from 1160°F to 1085°F in sixteen hours. From this data it is esti-
mated that it would take at least TO hours for CDT to cool down from 1200°F
to 850°F upon loss of electrical power to the tank heaters.

17.6 Discussion

The fuel loop operated gbove 900°F for 30,848 hours and the coolant
loop above 900°F for 27,438 hours. There were 13 heating and cooling cy-
cles of fuel loop and 12 for the coolant loop. The four drain tanks, in-
cluding the drain and fill lines, were operated near 1200°F continuously
since the salt was added to the tanks except for two times when FD-2 was
cooled down for installing and removing equipment for the 233y gddition.
There was not an interruption of the power operation of the reactor due
to a heater failure.

The main weakness of the ceramic heaters was the separation of the
extension leads from the heater elements. To correct this, a total of TO
(30 in the reactor and fuel drain tank cell and 40 in the coolant cell)
ceramic elements of an approved design were installed during the prepower
shutdown. Performance since then has been excellent. There were only
5 failures which could be attributed to the ceramic elements out of 221
installed units. |

‘plished by a power-driven cable which ‘lowered a small capsule into the cir-
culating liquid of the pump bowl. The capsule was then raised and the salt
was permitted to solidify before final retrieval and shipment to the Ana-
lytical Laboratory for .analysis. Lead shielding (710 inches) was installed
around the major components of the fuel sampler and a stainless-steel-clad
lead shipping cask was used to transport the sample. Double containment
was accomplished by moving the sample (after isolation from the pump bowl)
through a series of containment areas while maintaining at least two valves
or membranes between the fuel system or sample and the environment.
‘Since the induced activity in the coolant salt is very. short- lived,
no shielding was required during sampling and only single containment was
necessary during sample transport.

A total of 81 coolant salt samples were taken and. a total of is fuel
sampling cycles were completed during the five years of MSRE _operation.
Included in the fuel sampling total were 152 fuel enrichments of. either
uranium or plutonium. In addition to sampling and enriching, the fuel sam-
~pler was also used to sample the gas space above the liquid in the pump
bowl and to make chemical additions such as beryllium, niobium, and FeF,
to the fuel,

18.1 Fuel Sampler-Enricher

Since the fuel-sampler usage was more frequent and the complexity of
its components were greater than those of the coolant sampler, the major
part of this report describes the operating experience with the sampler-
enricher. A brief description of the coolant sampler and a discussion of

its operation are included at the end of this report.
18.1.1 Description of the Fuel Sampler-Enricher

The component arrangement of the fuel system sampler-enrichers? is
shown in Fig. 18.1. The vacuum pumps and helium purge gas system required

for pressure and atmosphere control are not shown. The drive motor for

the cable, the latch onto which capsules were hung were located in primary
containment area 1C which was approximately 17-1/2 feet from the pump bowl.
Critical closures such as the operational and maintenance valves (motor-
driven gate valves), access port to area 1C (doubly-sealed door), and the
removal valve (ball valve) were buffered with helium to assure that if any
sealing surfaces leaked, the leakage would be inert gas into the system.
Metered quantities of helium were supplied to these seals and the leakage
rates across the seals were measured by the final equilibrium buffer seal
pressure. Excess seal leakage into the system or to the containment ares
could be detected by a decrease in buffer seal pressure and a pressure in-
crease in the adjacent volume. To prevent the accidental opening or closure
of compartment doors or valves in improper sequence during sample transfer,
a system of electrical interlocks based on buffer seel pressures and-me-
chanical signals along with a detailed check list (6A-3) (Ref. 51) was used.
In general, a sample capsule, similar to that shown in Fig. 18.2, was load-
ed into a doubly sealed transport tube which was lowered through the re-
moval valve into area 3A, The lower part of the transport tube containing
the capsule was unscrewed and left in area 3A whereas the upper part was
withdrawn above the removal valve and the valve closed. The access port
to area 1C was then opened and the capsule was hung on the latch with the
manipulators (the latch and latch pin were so designed that the pin could
not be disengaged during sampling except in this area). The access port
was closed and area 1C was first evacuated then pressurized to equal that
in the pump bowl before the maintenance (MV) and operational (OV) valves
were opened. The cable drive motor was actuated until the capsule was im-
mersed in the salt in the guide cage of the pump bowl (Lower part of Fig.
18.1). The sample was withdrawn 18 in. where the salt was allowed to freeze
in the vertical section of unheated 1-1/2 in. Sched-k40 pipe before final
retrieval into area 1C. As the capsule or sample was moved. from one com-
partment to another there were evacuation and pressurization steps which
removed adsorbed oxygen during capsule insertion and removed gaseous fis-
sion products during sample removal. Capsule transfers inside the sampler
were viewed with a periscope.

Enriching was accomplished by lowering an enriching capsule (Fig. 18.2)
into the pump bowl end allowing the frozen salt in the capsule to melt and

be washed out before retrieval of the empty capsule (the walls of the en-
riching capsules were drilled through to the frozen salt in several places
Just prior to loading the capsule into the sampler).

The sampler-enricher was designed to make 1000 sampling or -enriching
cycles for a period of one year;>2 however, the MSRE and sampler were op-

erated for 20 runs over a period of 5 years.

18.1.2 Experience with the Fuel Sampler-Enricher During Pre-Critical and
Low-Power Operation

i

The sampler-enricher was installed and put in operation in May 1965.
Sampler testing, shakedown, and operator training sessions were conducted
concurrently with the sampling and enriching operations of Run 2. During
this period, 53 fuel samples were taken, 87 enrichments made, and 20 oper-
ators trained in the use of the sampler. Some of the problems encountered
during this period were:

1. Buffer gas leaks at the operational (OV), maintenance (MV),

and removal (RV) valves.

2. Failure of a solenoid valve on the removal valve actuator.

3. Failure of the removal valve to close completely requiring

manual closure.

i, Failure of the access port (AP) to close completely.

5. Momentary failure of cable drive motor on capsule retrieval.

6. Rupture of the flexible containment membrane (boot) at the

manipulator.
~- T. Deformation of the menipulator arm and fingers.

8. Accidental drop of an empty capsule onto the operational valve.
These and additional problems encountered with the subsequent 86 sampling
cycles made during the approach to power runs are discussed in more detail
in the following paragraphs.

Buffer Gas Leaks at the Operational and Maintenance Valves — During
the sampling operations of Run 2, leaks developed through the upper metal-
to-metal seats of both the operational and maintenance valves. The oper-
ational valve was subsequently removed; examination showed that a thin
black ring, which was easily removed, had formed at the upper sealing sur-

face of the valve gate and a small quantity of salt spheres (<1 gm) had
 

 

297

collected between the seats of the gate. Apparently salt particles were
dislodged from the capsules during the operation where the capsules (after
“having been dipped in the pump bowl) were disengaged from the latch above
the valve. When the stem and gate were lubricated, the valve sealed almost
completely; however on removal of the lubricant, the buffer gas leak rate
increased to 2 cc/min through the upper gate seal and remained at zero
through the lower seal.

A few sampling cycles after the valve was reinstalled, the leak rate
again increased to 20 cc/min through the upper seal. Apparently more salt
particles had lodged between the buffer-gas sealing surfaces. Repeated ef-
forts to blow the particles from the sealing surfaces feiled. Since there
were three other sealing surfaces between the pump bowl and the sample ac-
cess area and since the leak did not increase with continued sampling, the
valve was not replaced.

After approximately 86 additional sampling cycles, an opportunity to
clean the operational valve arose when the reactor was drained to repair
the cable drive motor in April 1966 (to be discussed later). Cleaning the
seating surfaces decreased the leak rate for a while until an empty cap-
sule was accidentally dropped on the gate. Subsequent valve operation
again resulted in a high buffer-gas leak rate. The buffer gas seal at this
surface continued to deteriorate slowly throughout the remainder of MSRE
operations; the only consequence vas a slow pressure buildup in the con-
tainment volume above the valve which required periodic venting. From
February 1967 until final shutdown, the buffer supply pressure to this seal
was used only when the sampler was in operation thereby obviating the peri-
odic venting of area 1C. i

During the latter part of 1966 there had been a gradual increase in
leakage of buffer gas through the upper seat of the maintenance valve also.
Although the procedure specified that the maintenance valve be opened be-
fore the operational valve is opened, and that the operational valve be
‘closed before the maintenance valve is closed, on at least one occasion the
reverse sequence was followed during closure and thus foreign matter could
have been dislodged from the upper valve onto the lower valve, While the

leak rate remained relatively small (v25 ce/min), it was sufficient to

 
 

 

298

cause difficulty with proper operation of the interlocks (an electrical
signal which indicated that the valve was indeed closed was based on the
ability of seating surfaces to maintain a specified buffer pressure). Since
cleanup would have been difficult and replacement of the valve was not war-
ranted by the leak rate alone, a mechanical method of assuring that the
valve was closed was substituted for the pneumatic method. No additional
problems with these valves were reported.

Area 1C Access Port — The access port door was operated by six clamps
which relied on pneumatic operators and a spring for opening and a sched-
uled time-delay of these pneumatic operators for closure}. however, once
closed, the mechanical linkage was such that the clamps no longer require
gas pressure to keep the door tightly closed. The ability of two. concen-
tric neoprene gaskets (between the access port door and housing) to contain
helium at 55 psia satisfied an interlock and indicated that a gas-tight
seal did indeed exist between areas 1C and 3A. On several occasions during
the pre-critical run, the access port failed to close properly. Also, one
or two of the six access port operators failed to open and the manipulator.
was used to release the sticking operators. During the shutdown following
the low-power experiment, the clamps were readjusted and an extension was
added to the pin of each clamp; this extension made it easier to open any
clamp manually with the manipulator in the event of a pneumatic malfunction.

Flexible Containment Membranes — There are two 0.020-in. thick flexi-
ble urethane membranes (boots) which partially enclosed and provided mo-
bility to the manipulator arm used in transferring capsules to and from the
latch in area 1C and the bottom portion of the transport carrier in area
3A. A vacuum was maintained between these boots to monitor the integrity
of the boots and assure that double containment did indeed exist between
the sampler operator and the sample. A loss of vacuum and a pressure re-
duction in area 3A would indicate a lesk in the outer boot whereas a loss
of vacuum with no pressure change in area 3A would implicate the inner boot
(atmosphere side) or possibly both boots.

There were three boot failures during the first 140 sampling cycles
of Run 2. One was caused by an inadvertent evacuation of area 3A while
the manipulator cover was off; the resultant pressure gradient ruptured

the boot. On another occasion, the boot was snagged on the bottom piece
 

299

of the transport tube in area 3A when the manipulator was used to release
a stuck access port clamp. The third failure resulted from pinching the
boot between the manipulator arm and the housing.

At the end of the next run (Run 3), a pressure switch (with an alarm
and interlock) was installed to detect and prevent a negative pressure
gradient greater than 1/2 psi between area 3A and the manipulator arm.
Steel rings were installed in the convolutions of the inner boot to hold
it free of the manipulator arm and possibly prevent the pinching-type
failure.

Also to ensure that at least two barriers existed between primary con-
tainment and sampling personnel, a pressure switch was installed on the
manipulator cover which required a negative pressure of b-in. Hg in the
cover before either the operational or maintenance valve could be opened.
In April 1966, the manipulator cover pressure was inadvertently evacu-
ated to v25-in. Hg without lowering area 3A pressure simultaneously; the
12-psi differential caused a small puncture of the inner boot. This set
of boots had been used for 48 sampling cycles since power operation was
begun and the maximum power reached at that time was 2.5 MW. The radiation
level of the manipulator assembly and boots was 10 R/hr at 3 inches from
the fingers, but was reduced by a factor of 10 by scrubbing with soap and
water, About 2 hours were required for replacement of both boots.

Deformation of the Manipulator Arm and Fingers -— During Run 2, the
manipulator arm and fingers were bent which caused difficulty in gripping
the latch cable and moving the manipulator arm. At the end of Run 3, the
arm was replaced and a 1/4 x 1/4 inch projection was welded to the bottom
of each finger to aid in grasping the capsule cable from the floor of area
3A. The manipulator arm was replaced and the clearances between the arm
and castle Joint were increased to reduce the force required to operate
the manipulator.

The manipulator and fingers operated satisfactorily for 421 additional
sampling cycles until August 1968 at which time the manipulator. assembly

~ was replaced because the tips of the fingers no longer closed tightly. The
old assembly was decontaminated and repaired. The replacement fingers op-

erated satisfactorily until September 1969 when the double metal bellows

 
 

 

300

developed a leak. The sampler on the fuel processing system was canniba-
lized to make the repairs; this unit operated satisfactorily for the sub-
sequent three months of reactor operation before shutdown.

~ Capsule Recovery from the Operational Valve — On one occasion during
the precritical ‘run, an empty sampling capsule was accidentally knocked
into area 1C before the latch pin was completely engaged in the latch, and
the capsule dropped onto the gate of the operational valve. The capsule
was retrieved by removing the manipulator assembly from 3A, opening the
access port, and snaring the capsule cable with a wire hook. Since this
type of accident could reoccur, the brass latch pins used to attach the
capsule to the latch were replaced with nickel-plated mild steel pins so
that capsule recovery could then be effected with a magnet.

After approximately a month of full-power operation in July 1966, an
empty capsule again was dropped onto the gate of the operational valve when
the manipulator slipped during the latching operation. A magnet was low-
ered into the transfer line and the capsule assembly was recovered as the
magnet was withdrawn. The radiation level of the magnet after the recovery
operation was 10 R/hr at 2 ft.

All sampling capsules of the bucket-type assembled since the latter
part of 1966 contained a nickel-plated mild steel top so that capsule re-
covery could be made with a magnet.

Removal Area, Valve, and Seals — During the pre-critical run, the
removal seal and valve required realignment and increased tolerances be-
fore the transport container and removal tool assembly would slide through
these units freely without binding. In addition, the removal valve failed
to seal properly even though the ball and seals were replaced. Therefore,
at the end of the next run, the valve assembly was replaced with a modified
version to improve the sealing characteristics and improve future access
to the valve. This unit served satisfactorily except that a buffer gas

leak developed in the top teflon seal of the valve during the latter part

of 1967. As a consequence of the leak, the equilibrium buffer seal pres-

sure reached only 30—35 psia instead of the normal 50-55 psia; the associ-
ated pressure switch which permits the opening of the operational and main-
tenance valves and the access port was lowered from 50 to 30 and finally

in December 1967 to 25 psia where it remained for the remainder of reactor

operations.
 

301

Latch, Capsule, and Cable Malfunctions — Early in Run 2, the cable
drive motor stalled during the withdrawal of an empty capsule. The cap-
sule was reinserted about 12 in. and then withdrawn successfully. The
reason for the malfunction was unknown. Approximately 100 sampling cycles
later in December 1965, the motor stalled again while withdrawing a 10-gm
sample. After repeated attempts, the capsule was withdrawn completely and
“the cable was examined. The capsule was empty and. the cable was found to
be backed up into the drive unit box and caught in the motor gears. It
was assumed that the latch had hung on the gate of the operational or main-
tenance valve causing the cable to coil up inside area 1C. The cable was
straightened, the limit switches on the operational ‘and maintenance valves
were reset to open .the valves wider and the diameter of the latch was re-
duced, .

In April 1966, after approximately a week at a power level of 5 MW,
the capsule drive-unit motor stalled as the latch was being retrieved
through the pipe bend near the pump bowl. After several inserts and with-

drawels, the latch was retrieved. The latch and part of the cable were
then pulled through the access port, the removal valve, and into the sample
transport cask which provided shielding while the latch was replaced with
one designed to provide an additional 1/8-inch diametrical clearance.

Approximately 3 months later the capsule stuck again temporarily for
some unexplained reason on withdrawal and no sample was obtained. Subse-
quent hangups with more serious consequences are discussed in Section 18.1.3.

Repair of an.Open Electrical Circuit — While testing the new latch,
the cable position indicator stopped when the latch was approximately two
feet from the pump bowl; the upper limit switch also actuated at this time.
Electrical continuity checks showed open circuits to the insert and with-
drew windings of the ceble arive motor and also to the upper limit switch.
~All these leads penetrate the containment wall through a common 8-pin re-
“ceptacle, Since repair could not be made while fuel was in the reactor
-without violating containment, the reactor was drained. ' The cable and
latch were then pulled into Area 3A using the manipulator to pull and the
. transport container and access port operators to hold the cable so that
the cable could be regrasped with the manipulators for another pull. The

 
 

 

 

302

operational and maintenance valves were then closed. The assembly includ-
ing the drive motor, cable, and latch were removed, partially decontami-
nated, and repaired with the use of shadow shielding techniques. (Three
connector pins in one of the 8-pin receptacles were burned off.) All six
similar receptacles at this location were filled with epoxy resin to pro-
vide additional insulation and strength. The ceble which was bent in sev-
eral places during retrieval was decontaminated with soap and water to re-
duce the radiation level to 5 R/hr at 3 in. before it was straightened.
After reassembly and checkout, normal sampling was resumed.

Contamination of the Removal Seal — An area at the top of the sampler
was provided so that the lower part of the transport carrier and capsule
could be evacuated and pressurized several times to remove oxygen and mois-
ture from the capsule and carrier before insertion into the dry box (Area
3A) of the sampler. The bottom seal for the removal area was provided by
the removal valve and a seal at the top was made when the transport tube
was inserted through a set of O-rings at the top of the removal volume.
During sampling the shipping cask was aligned and placed over the removal
area. A small amount of vacuum grease was smeared onto the lower part of
the transport tube before it was lowered through the shipping cask and into
the O-rings of the removal seal, When the transport tube was further lo-
wered into Area 3A (a contaminated area) to insert an empty capsule and
again to pick up the sample, the outer surfaces of the transport tube and
removal tool became contaminated with solid fission products from the cap-
sule, floor of Area 3A, and/or manipulator. Some of these particles were
wiped off by the O-rings of the removal seal as the removal tool and trans-
port tube were withdrawn from Area 3A; that remsining on the removal tool
was wiped off with a damp cloth. The shipping cask was gradually contami-
nated as both the removal tool and transport tube were drawn into it. By
this process the removal seal becomes progressively more contaminated with
each sample. During pre-critical operations this transfer mechanism for
particulate matter was not obvious; however, after power operations had
begun and especially after the letch maintenance work, where the latch was
manually retrieved from the vicinity of the pump and out through the re-
moval area for repair, the removal area and the top of the sampler became

contaminated.
 

 

303

- The adoption of the following procedure proved effective in preventing
the spread of contamination during sample removal and transport throughout
the remainder of reactor operations:

(1) The top of the sampler was established as a Contamination Zone.

(2) The removal tool was wiped with a damp cloth during withdrawal
from the removal ares.

(3) The shipping cask was wiped with a damp cloth prior to enclosure
in a plastic bag for shipment to the analytical laboratory.

(4) The top of the sampler was wiped with a damp cloth after each
sample.

(5) An exhaust hood was erected near the removal area and partially
enclosed the shipping cask to maintain a slightly reduced pressure in this
area so that any airborne particles would be drawn into the filter and ex-
haust system of the building.

(6) The removal seal area was cleaned periodically with damp wipes.

~ Control Circuitry Changes — During this period five changes were made
to the sampler control circuits:

(1) A pressure switch was added to prevent evacuation of Area 3A to
more than 10 in. of water greater than the manipulator cover ares.

(2) An interlock was added to require that both the operational and
maintenance valves be closed before the access port can be opened.

(3) A permissive switch and light were installed to indicate that
the access port can be opened only + when Area 1C pressure is equal to or
less than Area 3A pressure.

(4) A fuse was added to. the capsule drive motor circuit to protect
the motor and the electrical receptacles from excessive currents.

(5) Voltage suppressors were placed across the two motor windings
to limit any high voltage peaks during starting and stopping.

Miscellaneous Sampler—Enricher Problems — During the low-power experi-
ment, a five-inch-long capsule with an opening near the top and capable of
holding 50-g of salt was lowered into the pump bowl but failed to trap a
sample because the assembly was not long enough to permit total immersion.
Subsequent longer assemblies 19) obtained salt except one ‘which was believed
to have hung on the latch stop at the pump bowl and did not enter the pump.
The capsules were subsequently modified to allow them to hang straight.

 
 

304

“Most of the samples taken after the reactor exceeded 1 MW (nuclear
power) were highly radioactive and exceeded 1000 R/hr at 3 in. Fission
products adhering to the outside of the capsules contaminated the bottom
cups ‘of the transport containers. For a limited time disposable plastic
liners inserted in the cups were effective in reducing the radiation level
in the bottom portion of the transport tubes, However, as more fission
products built in the fuel and the interior of the sampler became more
contaminated, it was more economical to fabricate dispossble bottom cups
of mild steel rather than decontaminate and reuse the stainless steel cups.
The new cups were shorter than the previous ones and the plastic liner was
used to confine the capsule, wire, and latch pin so that the top part of
the transport carrier could be more easily slipped over this combination
to engage the threads and double O-ring seals at the bottom of the mild
steel cups.

On one occasion while the top of the transport container was being
mated with the bottom which contained a 50-g capsule, the wire on the cep-
sule caught in the threads of the mating pieces and galled before the two
pieces were sealed completely. Thereafter the liners were lengthened to
accommodate the the 50-g capsules.

In July 1966, the fuel pump was accidentally overfilled with flush
salt and salt was pushed up into the sampler tube approximately two feet
above the fuel pump where it froze and thus prevented the capsule and latch
from being lowered into the pump bowl. The salt was melted and allowed to
drain back into the pump by energizing a set of remotely-placed heaters
around the sampler tube and the normal heaters surrounding the pump bowl.
Normal sampling was subsequently resumed.

Contamination of the area surrounding the sampler was minimized during
maintenance by designating the area surrounding the sampler a Contamina-
tion Control Zone and at times. by erecting a plastic tent. around the sam-
pler. Repair work was done inside the zone with appropriate protective
clothing, gloves, and shoe scuffs. Contamination was found outside the
zone twice and on both occasions it was attributed to contaminated shoes

which indicates that this type of contamination is not readily airborne.

18.1.3 Subsequent Operating Experience with the Sampler-Enricher

The major sampler problems encountered during the remainder of opera-
tions were caused by the latch and/or capsule lodging at the entrance to
the sampler tube or at one of the isolation valves immediately below Area
1C with ‘subsequent unreeling and tengling of the cable in Area 1c and in
the gears of the drive unit. Co

Ruptures or pin-hole leaks in the boots enclosing the manipulator arm
were a chronic source of trouble requiring periodic replacement, Life of
the boots varied widely but averaged Ll sample cycles before failure. The
cause of most of these leaks was undetermined because the boots could not
be examined easily due to the high radiation level of the manipulator as-
sembly. oo

Gradual deterioration of the buffer gas seals at the operational,
maintenance and removal valves and at the access port continued and on
occasions the time required to take a sample was lengthened because a
longer time interval was required for the buffer pressure to build up suf-
ficiently to actuate the proper relay for the next step in the procedure.

Loss of Capsules in the Pump Bowl — In. August 1967 during what ap-
peared to be a normal sampling operation, the capsule and/or latch had ap-
parently lodged ‘at ‘the maintenance valve while being lowered, causing the
cable to coil up in Area 1C and into the motor drive area where it had be-
come snarled and kinked. The first indication of a malfunction was during
the. capsule retrieval cycle when the motor stalled with 8 £t 3 in. of cable
off the reel, 53 Repeated inserts and withdrawals recovered only 5 more in.
of cable before the motor stalled with only an inch of travel in either di-

“rection (this had happened once before in 1965 but the cable. and capsule
were retrieved completely at ‘that time).

If the capsule and cable were lodged at the sempler tube entrance be-
© low Area 1C, then the operational and maintenance valves could be closed
and sampler repairs could proceed without a reactor drain; otherwise a
drain would be necessary. After consideration of several possibilities, it
was decided to disengage the motor drive from the operational valve and
close the valve slowly with the hand wheel with the idea that if the cap-
sule were below the valve, the cable would offer enough resistance to clo-

sure to be detected in which case the valve would be reopened and the

 
 

 

306

reactor drained before repair. No resistance was detected until the valve \&/
was practically closed. Therefore, both valves were closed and when Area
1C was opened, as expected, the cable was coiled up withing however the
latch, capsule, and sbout 6 in. of cable were missing. The reactor was
then drained and grappling tools were fabricated of flexible tubing and
cables which could be inserted through the sampler into the pump bowl.
Four of the five tools which were most successful at grasping a dummy latch
are shown in Fig. 18.3. |
When the noose tool was lowered, it snared the latch but the 1/32-in.
steel cable broke because the latch was apparently glued in place with salt
at the latch stop. The dislodging tool was then used but apparently to no
avail because a second noose grasped the latch but could not budge it with
a pull of 25 1b. The pump was then heated until the latch was at a tem-
‘perature of TOO°F. It was then lifted several feet without difficulty be-
fore it lodged in the tube, apparently at the expansion joint between the
fuel pump and the sampler. A corkscrew tool was next inserted but the
latch again hung on retrieval, this time at ‘the first bend near the fuel
pump. The latch retrieval tool which was designed to fit over the severed Oo
cable and stem and thus prevent the cable from Jamming against the wall
‘during retrieval was successful in pulling up the cable, latch, and latch
pin, The capsule apparently snapped its cable and dropped to the bottom
of the sampler cage when the latch came to a sudden stop at the latch stop.
The dotted outline of a capsule in Fig. 18.4 shows how a capsule, once de-
‘tached from its cable, could slip out of the sampler cage and then be
trapped by the mist shield in the pump bowl.
Since the capsule top is made of nickel plated mild steel, 8 magnet
in combination with a go-gage (Fig. 18.3) was lowered into the pump bowl
to verify that the sampling tube was unobstructed and to pick up the cap-
sule, Capsule recovery was unsuccessful and since no adverse chemical or
mechanical effects were envisioned should the capsule be allowed to remain
in the mist shield, further retrieval attempts were abandoned.
While retrieval efforts were in progress, a replacement 1-C assembly
which was on hand, was equipped with a latch made of 430 stainless steel
and with a sleeve to prevent future tangling of the cable in the gears of
the drive unit. However, subsequent examination of the old drive unit in (-

a hot cell revealed that the cable was not tangled in the gears as had
been assumed; the failure to withdraw or.insert was due to a sharp kink
in the cable which becane lodged in the 17/32-in. diameter channel of the
latch positioner.

When normal operations and sampling were resumed, a commercially avail-
able device was tested which was capable of sensing the latch (now made of
magnetic material) inside the sampler tube. A design was prepared to mount
this proximity switch about 10 in. below the maintenance valve to detect
the latch as it is lowered during normal sampling; however, before it could
be installed, the latch again lodged in the sampler tube without detection
in March 1968. The usual 17 ft 5 in. of cable was reeled off and was tan-
gled in Area 1C, As it was rewound, the motor stalled with 13 ft 5 in. off
the reel. When repeated withdrawel attempts failed, the reactor was drained
and the capsule access port was opened. The capsule was visible through the
lower corner of the opening and the latch could be seen in the back of the
chamber with many loops and coils, some of which appeared to extend down
into the sampler tube. Rather than risk cutting the cable, the isolation
valves were left open; however, when an attempt was made to lift the cap-
sule out. of the chamber, the manipulator brushed some of the coils causing
them to spring out through the port and pull the capsule wire from the ma-
nipulator fingers. The capsule dropped into the sampler tube and the latch
tipped over, thus releasing the key; the capsule and key then disappeared
down the sampler tube in what appeared to be a bottom-up position.

After. several unsuccessful attempts were made to retrieve the capsule
by lowering magnets of various sizes into the pump bowl; the reactor was
filled with flush salt. A 50-g capsule (5 in. long with an opening 4-1/8
in. from the bottom of the capsule) was lowered into the pump but came up
empty; salt droplets clinging to the outside indicated that the capsule had
- been only half submerged. Later a 10-g capsule did collect a sample.

In the meantime a full-scale plastic and metal mock-up of the sampler
tube, mist shield, and sampler cage was constructed and used to select the
best tools and magnets which could be lowered via the sampler in another
attempt to retrieve the capsule.3* The simplest and most effective tool
proved to be 1/2 and 3/4-in, diameter Alnico-5 magnets. When the flush

salt was drained and retrieval efforts resumed, sounds from a contact

 
 

© 310

microphone on the fuel pump indicated that the 1/2-in. dia. magnet lifted
an object a few inches and then dropped it. After many attempts, the mag-
net came up with an object which later proved to be the corroded top of the
old capsule. Further efforts with either magnet were unsuccessful and the
second capsule was sbandoned., |

During this shutdown, the proximity switch was installed gbout bt in.
below the maintenance velve and the sampling procedure was modified to
stipulate that if the switch is not actuated when the capsule position indi-
cator shows that sufficient cable has been reeled off to reach the prox-
imity switch, the drive will be stopped. ' Also a variac was added to the
drive motor circuit so that the operating voltage could be changed to 80
volts to lessen the possibility of seriously kinking the cable,

During the next startup, with flush salt in the reactor, salt was
trapped in a-10-g capsule but none trapped in a 50-g capsule which requires
an immersion depth of 4-1/8 in. to trap a sample, However, a 30-g capsule
requiring only 2-1/2 in. of immersion did trap a sample. These results
agree with. the measurements taken during capsule retrieval which indicated
that the abandoned capsule was 1-3/4 in. above the bottom of the cage.
However, with fuel in the reactor, the actual level in the pump bowl was
somewhat higher then that indicated because of the high void fraction of
‘the liquid in the pump bowl. Consequently no problems were encountered
taking 50-g fuel samples throughout the remainder of operations except
during the latter part of 1969 when the fuel pump speed was lowered to
980 rpm. At this speed the fuel salt void fraction is approximately equiv-
alent to that for flush salt at normal pump speed. The failure to trap a
"50-g sample under these conditions indicated that the position of the aban-
doned capsules had not changed after approximately one year of operation.

In October 1969, a serious cable tangling problem was averted by the
use of the proximity switch. When the switch failed to actuate after 3 ft
10 in. of ceble was paid out during an otherwise normal capsule insert, the
cable was retrieved until the position indicator indicated that all of the
cable was back on the taskeup reel and the capsule was fully withdrawn into
isolation chember 1C. The operational and maintenance valves were then
closed and the access port was opened. The cable was indeed fully re-
trieved as indicated and the capsule was fuflly visible but was lodged
 

 

 

311

diagonally between the ledges of the doorway to the chamber. Apparently
the capsule had lodged at the sampler tube entrance or at one of the isola-
tion valves and as the cable was paid out, it somehow encircled the capsule
because the capsule was lifted and relodged at a higher position (during
ceble retrieval) than it was at the start of the sampling procedure. The
capsule was then lowered to its normal position and all subsequent cable
operations proceeded without interruptions.

Wiring Fault — In November of 1967 as a sample was being withdrawn,
the 0.3-amp fuse in the drive motor failed. Subsequent tests showed that
the insert mode was normal -at 0.2 amp but during withdrawal, the current
increased to 1.0 or 1.5 amp, indicating leakage to ground. During further
tests, three circuits opened, disabling the insert and withdraw circuits
and the upper limit switch, After the erection of a tent and other meas-
ures to prevent the spread of contamination, a 3-in., diam hole was sawed
in the cover plate of Area 3A directly above the cable penetration into
the inner box (Area 1C). The failure was found where the wires were bent
back against the side of the plug on the lower end of the cable between
the inner (1C) and outer (3A) containment boxes. When a temporary con-
nection indicated that everything within Area 1C was operable, the sample
was retrieved and the isolation valves were closed. The damaged section
was abandoned and a new cable was installed having a penetration through
a b-in. pipe cap welded over the sawed hole in the top cover.

While the pipe cap was being welded in place, a heavy current evi-
dently went to ground through an adjacent penetration, destroying the plug
“and receptacle. Repairs were made by cutting out and replacing this pene-
tration. As a result of this experience, an isolation transformer and fuse
was added to each of the three drive unit cables which allows one ground
without interference with operation. After the repairs, all circuits were
operable except the upper limit switch which stops the drive motor when the
latch reaches the latch stop. Since the motor and circuit can easily with-
stand blocked-rotor current, the upper limit switch was bypassed and there-
after the motor was turned off when the position indicator indicated that
the latch was fully withdrawn.

‘Repair of Cable Drive Gear — In December 1968 during an attempt to
remove a capsule from the latch, it was found that the cable could be

 
 

312

pulled off the reel while the drive motor was stationary. The tentative
diagnosis was that one of the pair of drive gears was slipping on its

shaft. In order to gain access to the drive unit, it was necessary to re-
move the shield blocks over the reactor cell which, in turn, required that
the fuel be drained. After a temporary containment enclosure and contami-
nation zone had been set up around the sampler, the containment box, 1c,
containing the drive unit was disconnected, lifted, and a 3-in. hole sawed
through the side adjacent to the gears. One gear was found to be loose be-
cause its two setscrews had come loose. The gear was repositioned and tack-
welded on its shaft and the other gear was fastened with jam screws on -top
of its setscrews. A patch was then welded on the box and the unit rein-
stalled. The work was done without excessive exposure of personnel despite
the high radiation levels (10 R/hr at 12 in. from the box) by use of shield-
ing and extended tools designed especially for the job.

"Since other parts of the sampler were easily accessible during this
shutdown, the manipulator hand was repaired, the illuminator port and view-
ing window lens were replaced because of discoloration by radiation, and
an imperfect seal in the removal valve was replaced.

Vacuum Pump Problems — The sampler was equipped with two vacuum pumps.
Vacuum pump No. 1 was used to evacuate contaminated areas such as contain
ment areas 1C and 3A and discharged into the auxiliary charcoal bed; vacuum
pump No. 2 was used to evacuate non-contaminated areas such as the manipu-
lator cover and the plenum between the manipulator boots and discharged in-
to the containment air system filters and to the stack.

During the July 1966 shutdown, the oil levels in the pumps were
checked and a small amount of oil was added.

In January 1969 there was an activity release to the stack (<0.08 mc)
which was attributed to a gas leak around the shaft of vacuum pump No. 1.
The pump was replaced because the oil seal at the shaft could not be re-
paired without extensive decontamination procedures. Four months later,
repeated vacuum pump motor outages (due to overload) were apparently caused
-by low oil level. On one inspection, the pump was practically empty of oil
with no evidence of external oil leaks and was consequently refilled to the

proper level. On the next inspection, the pump contained approximately .
313

2 qts more than the normal inventory. Apparently the previously lost oil
drained back into the pump. High pressure (>13 psia) in Area 1C was nor-
mally vented into the auxiliary charcoal bed through a line bypassing the
pump. Apparently high pressure was vented through the vacuum pump instead,
thus carrying over a large portion of the oil into the holdup tank and off-
gas line above the pump discharge. After the oil level was readjusted,
pump operation returned to normal and the last oil check was normal.

Heated Shipping Cask —— At temperatures less than 400°F, radiation
from fission products can produce free fluorine in frozen fuel salt. To
minimize fluorine production and thus avoid the effects of fluorine on the
results of oxide and trivalent uranium analyses, a shipping cask was fabri-
cated which maintained the fuel sample at approximately 500°F from the time
it was removed from the sampler until it was unloaded at the analytical
“laboratory. The cask used molten babbitt both as shielding and as a heat
reservoir. Built-in electric heaters melted the babbitt before the sample
was loaded and the heat of fusion maintained the sample at a relatively
constant temperature for sbout 9 hours during shipment and storage. For
the elevated temperature, O-rings made of Viton A were substituted for the
standard neoprene O-rings in the transport tube. In addition to the double
O-ring seal provided by the transport tube, the transport tube was capped
inside the cask during shipment.

All samples were unavoidably cooled to room temperature in the sampler
where they were sealed in the transport tube at atmospheric pressure. When
the transport tube was inserted into the heated cask, the pressure in the
tube increased to approximately 10 psig because of the temperature increase.
On one occasion when the cap was removed from the cask, airborne activity
was released from the cask cavity into the ventilation system of the un-
loading station at the analytical laboratory. Subsequently the sealing
surfaces of the top part of the transport tube were found to have been
eroded by repeated decontamination procedures to such an extent that the
double O-ring seals were ineffective. After examination of the sealing
surfaces of the remaining five transport tube tops and reevaluation of the
decontamination costs, it was decided to discard the reusable stainless

steel transport tubes and use "throw-away" transport tubes made of mild

 
 

 

314

steel for all subsequent samples. A valve was later added to the cap of
the heated cask so that any future pressure buildup in the cask cavity
could be released to a charcoal filter before cap removal.

Other Capsules and Samples — The size of the capsules that could be
accommodated by the sampler was limited to 0.75 inches in diameter and
6-1/4 inches in length. ‘Approximately 1/4 inch greater diameter could be
accommodated by the sampler but not by the transport tube. Four of the
various types of capsules which were lowered into the pump bowl are shown
in Figures 18.5a through 18.54. The capsule in Fig. 18.5a was used to trap
either salt or gas. The capsule was first evacuated and sealed with a mea-
sured emount of salt similar to the fuel. On entry into the fuel pump, the
sealing salt melted and salt or gas (depending on the capsule elevation in
the pump bowl just prior to salt liquefaction) was drawn into the capsule.
When the beryllium addition capsules were withdrawn, they were en-
crusted with solids as shown in Figure 18.5b. As a result, the capsules
were difficult to load into the bottom part of the transport tubes even
though the plastic liner was removed. Also the enriching capsules were
sometimes difficult to load because of their length (6-1/4 in.). The ca-
bles of these long capsules were occasionally caught in the threads of the
mating parts of the transport container and were difficult to unload at the
“hot cell. : Co

The radiation levels of the beryllium capsules and the empty enriching
capsules were more than four times higher than the standard 10-g sample
when delivered to the analytical laboratory.

"Miscellaneous Sampler Problems — During the latter part of 1966, a
cotter key had come out of the top of the lower hinge pin on the access
port door. The hinge pin had then worked out of the top of the hinge.
Using only the manipulator, the pin was repositioned in the hinge, a new
cotter key was inserted in the pin and the key was spread to lock it in
place: During this repair, the lower key was dislodged and was also re-
paired. :

Operation of the pneumatic clemps 6n the access port door occasion-
ally resulted in gaseous fission products being vented through the operator
discharge lines. Therefore a small charcoel filter was added to the op-
erator discharge lines to prevent this activity from being discharged to

the atmosphere via the stack. Also the vent valves from the gas operators
were kept closed except during openings and closures of the access door.

The neoprene seal at the access door continued to deteriorate. In
April of 1967, the increased buffer gas leakage across the inner seal was
countered by lowering the buffer pressure requirement in the safety inter-
lock system from 50 to ko psia. In July 1967, the safety switch setting
was lowered to 35 psia and the helium flow rate to the buffer seal was also
increased so that a satisfactory buffer pressure could be maintained.
During the intensive sampling of the last run, the access port door fre-
quently required repositioning with the manipulators before the second set
of clamps were actuated to lock the door and obtain an adequate seal.

The cause of the deterioration of this seal has not been determined.
The radiation level of some of the samples taken was in excess of 1000 R/hr
at 3 inches and during boot replacements when the sampler was empty, the
radiation level inside Area 3A was approximately 100 R/hr. Although some
long-term deterioration may be attributed to radiation damage, more likely
the reduction in buffer pressure during the last two runs can be attributed
to the fact that the left center Knu-vise clamp was loose and thus ineffec-
tive in its closed position.

The flexible containment membranes (boots) on the manipulator contin-
ued to be a chronic source of trouble. Generally, when a leak developed,
the sampling cycle would be completed before repairs were made; however,
during the remainder of the sampling cycle, containment was abetted by
throttling the boot evacuation valve to assure that any leakage would be
into the plenum between the boots and through the vacuum pump to the stack
rather than to the work area. After full power was achieved, replacement
of the boots became somewhat more involved because the manipulator assembly
was quite contaminated. During a boot replacement in early 1967, the radi-
ation level of the manipulator arm was 300 R/hr at 3 in. It was later de-
contaminated and saved for possible future use.

Also while sampling during early full-power operations, the radiation
level at the operating area increased to approximately 30 mR/hr. The radi-
ation level was reduced by an order of magnitude by changing the sampling

procedure so that a purge of helium from Area 1C to the pump bowl was
 

 

 

317

mainteined when the operational and maintenance valves were open, Also on
retrieval into Area 1C, the samples were purged for 1-1/2 hr to the off-gas
- system before further removal operations were continued,

On two occasions during the routine transfer of capsules between
Areas 1C and 3A, a capsule was inadvertently dropped and rolled out of
sight and out. of manipulator range in Area 3A. These were later found and
recovered by the use of a mirror and a grappling fork which were lowered
through the removal valve,
During the latter part of Run 19, routine sampling was suspended for
approximately four days and the sampler was adapted to accommodate a col-
limator and a germanium crystal detector atop the sampler where the carrier
cask is normally positioned. A plastic plug in the removal area permitted
the unobstructed view into Area 3A where samples retrieved from the fuel
pump were positioned. Gamma-ray spectrometry data were then collected on
short-lived fuel fission products within 50 minutes of their removal from

the circulating salt stream.
18.1.4 Discussion and Conclusions

The main operational problems encountered with the sampler-enricher

 

resulted from 1) manipulator boot failure, 2) lodging of the capsule or
latch at the sampler tube entrance, operational valve, or maintenance valve
with subsequent cable tangling, and 3) buffer seal leaks at the operation _
and removal valves and at the capsule access door.

The cause of some of the boot failures were not determined because
the leaks were small and the actions which produced the ruptures were not
always coincident with the discovery of the legk. Also the boots were not:
examined in detail because of the high radiation level of the boots and
manipulator assembly. It is believed that the boot failures which could
- not be attributed to any specific action occurred during the capsule load-
ing operation where the manipulator is retracted and pushed downward and
to the left in order to load the sample into the liner of the transport
tube bottom. At times (almost invariably with the long capsules), the
sampler operator had to resort to pulling the manipulator with both hands
in order to retract it far enough to insert the capsule and latch pin into

the liner. Had the capsule loading station been mounted to the left of
 

318

the manipulator centerline, it could have been located closer to Area 1C
and thus require less manipulator travel. Another possible alternative
would be to fabricate the boots with fewer convolutions; however, the con-
volution width would have to be increased to maintain the same extended
length. The retracted thickness of the boots would then be decreased per-
mitting the manipulator to be pulled back farther than previously.

Why and where the capsule or latch occasionally lodged in the sampler
tube during capsule insertion has not been satisfactorily answered. How-
ever, the use of the proximity switch minimized the possibility of serious
cable tangling problems. Perhaps two additional detection devices mounted
above and below the operational valve would have determined the exact -
trouble spot.

The buffer seal leak at the access port door started to increase in
January 1967 and continued to increase slowly for the remainder of MSRE
operations. Perhaps some of this deterioration can be attributed to radi-
ation damage to the neoprene gaskets. The radiation level in Area 3A was
100-200 R/hr during intensive sampling. Also, the access door was always
in the closed position except during capsule transfer; therefore the neo-
prene was almost always compressed which over the years has probsbly caused
it to yield to a thinner protrusion. In addition, the stellite plates on
the access door appear to be gouged slightly by the stellite-tipped Knu-vise
clamps. Also the left center clamp was discovered to be loose in its closed
position during the last run. Therefore, it is believed that ordinary wear-
and-tear of these components was the primary cause of seal leakage. The
beating that the door took could possibly have been lessened by a flow re-
strictor to the clamp actuating cylinders.

The top seals of the buffered valves developed leaks whereas the bot-
tom seals apparently suffered only slight deterioration which indicates
that particulate matter which occasionally drop on the valves was the cause
of seal deterioration. Consequently the volumes above these valves showed
s gradual increase in pressure and required constant venting. The least
desirable of these leaks was that at the removal valve. On removal of a
semple, the trensport tube and removal tool which are withdrawn from
Area 3A are locked in position above. the removal valve and the removal

valve is then closed. If an appreciable deley is encountered between the

No
319

time that the valve is closed and the time that the transport tube is with-
drawn from the removal seal into the shipping cask, appreciable pressure
(due to seal leakage) can build up in the removal area and blow contami-
nation out. of the removal ares to the top of the sampler and shipping cask
when the transport tube clears the two O-rings of the removal seal. Swab-
bing the removal area with wet wipes on a monthly basis greatly reduced

the contamination problem encountered in this area. During intensive sam-

pling, this area should be cleaned more frequently.

The specifications for the electrical insulation on.the lead wires
near the penetrations at Areas 1C and 3A should be reviewed. A failure
at the connector pins occurred in May 1966 resulting in open circuits in

the insert and withdraw modes and in the upper limit light. During in-

spection of the 1C assembly which was removed in August 1967, the insula-

tion .on the lead wire was found to be very brittle and most of it was un-
avoidably. stripped during removal of the drive unit. In November 1967 an
electrical fault occurred in: the same circuits as those in May 1966 except
the failure occurred in the wires between the two containment boxes. It
is not clear whether these failures can be attributed to radiation damage
to the insulation or possibly to ‘excess temperature caused by resistance
heating in the lead wire due to blocked rotor current (0.3 amps) in com-
bination with the heat supplied by the illuminator lamp.

To increase the precision of uranium isotopic analyses, provisions
should be made to clean Area 3A periodically, especially after enrichments
are made. During the enriching procedure, small quantities of enriching
salt could easily adhere to the manipulator and/or be jarred loose from
the capsule and fall to the floor of Area 3A where all capsules are laid
temporarily while swapping ‘capsules to and from the latch and the transport
tube, A very small amount of enriched salt adhering to a sample submitted
for isotopic analysis could distort the interpretation of the resulting

analyses.

18.2 Coolant Sampler

In principle, sampling of the coolant system was the seme as that for
the fuel system, However, the induced activity in the coolant salt was
very short-lived and there was: 10 residual radioactivity in the sample;
therefore, no shielding was required end only single containment was neces-
sary during transport. Direct manipulation of the sample by one hand
through a glove part simplified sampler construction and operation.

18.2.1 Description of the Coolant Sampler

The coolant salt sampler, shown in Fig. 18.6 consisted essentially
of a dry box connected to the coolant pump by a transfer tube. Two ball
valves isolated the sampler from the pump bowl which hes a mist shield and
capsule guide similar to that in the fuel pump. The 1-1/2 in. Sched-ki0
transfer tube was similar to that used for the fuel system except that no
expansion Joint was required because the coolant pump position did not
change with system temperature as did the fuel pump. The sampler was pro- |
vided with lighting and viewing ports and the necessary capsule transfers
inside the sampler were done with one hand through a glove port. Sliding
gas seals at the top of the sample carrier elong with a vacuum pump and a
helium supply were used to reduce oxygen conteminastion to a minimum during
sampling and during sample transport to the analytical laboratory.
A check-1ist type procedure along with a system of locks and keys for
valve manipulation was used to essure proper sequence of operations. A
key was used to unlock one velve, which could then be opened. When the
valve was opened, it also locked the first key in position and released a
second key. Removal of the second key (vhich must be removed to unlock
the next valve in sequence) assured that the first valve was locked in the

proper position.

v

18.2.2 Operating Experience with the Coolant System Sampler

The coolant salt sampler operated relatively trouble-free throughout
MSRE operations. Only 81 coolant system samples were teken as opposed to
Th5 cycles for the fuel system.

Early in 1966 during one sampling operation, the latch failed to slide
freely through the transfer tube. No reason for the difficulty could be
found. However, the outside diameter of the latch was reduced and no simi-
lar trouble was reported. oo -

Also in the first part of 1966, one pin in an indicator light circuit
shorted out at the penetration during a sampling cycle. The receptacle was
removed and a new one welded in place.

During the seme period, the leak rate from the lower seal of the re-
moval valve increased. After the valve was disassembled, cleaned, and re-
assembled; the seal was satisfactory; however, after approximately -eight
additional samples, the seal leakage again increased and was corrected by
replacing the valve seals. Also an extra washer was added to the valve to
permit more mechanical pressure to be applied to the seals. Thereafter the
coolant sampler operated trouble-free for the final three years of MSRE

operation.
18.2.3 Conclusions and Recommendations

From an operational viewpoint, two improvements may be worth con-
sidering: | |

(1) The glove port cover should be hinged to swing out horizontally.
On several occasions when the clamps were removed, the glove port cover.
slipped from the operator's hand and dropped freely to its stopped posi-
tion. In doing so, it could have pinched a bundle of nearby insulated
electrical wires.

- (2) The sample carrier should be lengthened approximately two inches

to accommodate the longer capsules which were used during the last run.

19. CONTROL RODS

M. Richardson

19.1 . Description

Three control rods were used in the MSRE core vessel, The rods were
not exposed directly to the fuel salt but were contained in three "blind
well" thimbles which were located in three of the four channels surrounding
the vertical centerline of the graphite core. The thimbles were straight
within the core vessel, but above the reactor access flange they were off-
set — using two 16-in. radius bends to provide space for the core sample

containment standpipe. A roller was located at each bend to reduce fric-

‘tion. The control rod drive mechanisms were vertically positioned around

the standpipe. The control rods were fabricated of flexible metal hose

with hollow center cylindrical poison elements (38 per rod) beaded over

the lower 60 in. Rod motion was supplied by motor driven 1/b-in. roller

chain and sprocket drive units. Included in the reverse locking power
train is an overrunning clutch which permits power transmission in the in-
sert direction only. A magnetic clutch was used to release each rod from
the power train gearing and permitted free fall of the rod into the core
at AOL g.

Continuous indication of each rod position was provided by two synchro
torque transmitter-receiver pairs, one "fine" and one "coarse." A potenti-

ometer provided position indication for safety interlocks in the reactor

£111 circuits.

The upper and lower limits of rod travel were controlled by four (2
upper. and 2 lower) mechanically actuated switches.

The poison elements were cooled by cell air (95% N,) from the compon-

“-ent coolant system. This entered the upper end of the hollow control rod

and exhausted radially into the thimble from a nozzle at the lower end: of

‘the rod.

Changes in pressure drop as this nozzle moved through a flow restric

tor built into. the bottom of the thimble provided a rod position reference

point (fiducial zero). Comparison of this with the rod position as indi-

cated by the synchro rod position instrumentation was used to monitor

stretching of the rods and other malfunctions.

 
 

 

324

The rod drive units were identical as were the rods except for a
slight variation in lengths of the individual rods due to the differences
of the thimble offsets. This allowed interchange of components for repairs
or trouble-shooting. For identification of a rod assembly, it was neces-
sary to specify the thimble number (T-1, T-2, or T-3), the rod number (R-1,
R-2, R~-3, or R-l4) and the drive number (V-1, V-2, V-3, or V-4), The rod
assembly connected to the servo controller was considered to be the regu-
lating rod and the other two rods were the shim rods. The rod assemblies
could be used interchangeably as shims or regulating rods by shifting the
out-of-cell rod drive disconnects. Any one rod vas capable of teking the
reactor suberitical.24

The rods and drive assemblies were not ‘designed for in-cell mainte-
nance, Repairs on the drive units were done after disassembling the rod
from the drive and removing the drive unit from the reactor cell by remote
maintenance methods.

The control rod shock absorbers used the _ principles of a typi-
cal hydraulic shock sbsorber but differed in that the working "fluid" con-
sisted of 3/32-in.-diameter steel balls, At the end of a scram, the bottom

 face.of the shock absorber cylinder struck permanently-mounted steel blocks

which were bolted to the housing. The shock ebsorber plunger, to which the
control rod was attached, continued to move downward and was decelerated

by the forces developed by the buffer springs and by the flow of the steel
balls around a knob on the plunger. The stroke length of the shock absor=

bers were adjusted to 3.5 inches for each rod,

19.2 Initial Testing

The rods were installed in the reactor vessel in January of 1965. The
limit switches were adjusted to coincide with the rod position indicators
on the main console and electrical continuity tests were performed on all
drives prior to assembly to the control rods. Satisfactory ambient tem-
perature performsnce was checked with the results given in Table 19.1.

19.3 Periodic Testing

During reactor operation and especially after power operations com-
menced, it was not possible to run extensive tests on the rods. However,
it was necessary to do sufficient testing to assure that the rods would
scram if needed. It was also important to know that the rod position indi-
cators were functioning properly as these were used in making reactivity
‘balances. To accomplish this and to aid in anticipating necessary mainte-
~ nance; the following periodic tests were made. ‘

A, Rod Scrams — Scram tests were routinely conducted to determine
rod scram times before a fuel fill and before critical operation. Each
rod was withdrawn to a height of 50 in. The magnetic clutch current was
broken by tripping the manual screm switch. The rod would free-fall to the
fully-inserted position. The 50-in. drop was electronically timed from the
moment of release to the lower limit switch. The maximum permissible scram
time was 1.3 sec/50 in.

B. Rod Exercise — Since rod scram tests could not be made during

nuclear operation, each rod was exercised daily to demonstrate that they

 
 

 

326 IE

would move on command and also to flex the metallic hose. The flexible
hoses tended to stiffen with time if allowed to remain in one position for
prolonged periods. Observation by the reactor operator of the rod-position
indicators during the exercise ascertained that the synchros were working
properly and that the rods operated freely in the thimbles.

C. Fiducial Zero — As described above, the fiducial zero was a fixed
reference position in each of the control rod thimbles which related the
actual rod position to the rod position indicated by the position-indicating
potentiometers. Fiducial zero tests were routinely made before a fuel fill

and before critical operation.

19.4 Operating Experience

Except for difficulties with the rod assemblies in thimble T-1, opera-
tion was satisfactory from both an operational and maintenance standpoint.
There were no unscheduled shutdowns because of a control rod failure. The"
testing program was adequate to allow advance maintenance planning and work
was done in conjunction with maintenance in other areas at the time of a
scheduled shutdown. .

During over 3,000 rod scrams from 50 inches (see Table 19.2) and num-
erous others from different elevations, there was only one time when a rod
failed to scram. Except for this and one other period, the scram times
were all less than the 1.3 seconds specified in the safety limits and were
usually less than 1 second. The number or amount of rod movement is not
known, Once positioned, there was little movement of the shim rods. The
regulating rod, normally the assembly in thimble T-1, moved little at steady
power until bubbles appeared in the reactor. From that point on the regu-
lating rod moved frequently under servo control to compensate for the action
of bubbles on the reactivity. Several rod jog tests were made and it is
estimated that the regulating rod moved about 720 jogs per hour at 0.l in.

- per jog for a. total of 32,400 jogs. The total movement was sbout 14,000

inches.

The estimated life of the control rod motors was 10,000 hours at a
reactor power of 10 MW (Ref. 49). The condition of all drive motors, lu-
brication, wiring, and gears remained. satisfactory throughout the entire
operation. These were last inspected in July 1969 et which time the reac-
tor had accumulated 92,805 Mwhrs.

The history of the MSRE control rods and drives are best summarized
in Figs. 19.1, 19.2, and 19.3. Control rods R-1 and R-2 remained in ser-
vice the entire operating period in thimbles 1 and: 2. Control rods R-3
and R-l were interchanged in thimble 3 as shown in Fig. 19. 3. ~The component
failures of. the drives are tabulated in Table 19.3. |

Heat-up and pre-critical salt circulation commenced in January 1965
and during the early period of this operation, difficulty was encountered
with the limit switches. The: indications were that the switch operators
were sticking or galling randomly on all three rods. Temporary repeirs
were made during the March and April 1965 shutdown when investigation re-
vealed that the sliding members of the switch operators had galled causing
“the faulty operation,

The drives were mores from the reactor cell in July 1965 for instal-
lation of modified limit switch operators on all the units including the

spare (V-4). The new operators contained case-hardened bearing surfaces,
there were no more difficulties of this type with the switch operators.
Examination of the control rods during this period revealed that the
upper wire sheathed upper hose of the No. 3 rod was badly worn at a point
28 in. below the flange. Examination of the No. 3 thimble revealed that
the upper roller, on which the control rod operates, did not rotate which
caused the severe wear to the rod, The roller was replaced and a new hose
installed on the No. 3 control rod..
~~. During this period temperature switches were added to the lower drive
mechanism, These small bi-metallic switches were to alarm should the tem-
perature within the drive unit cases exceed 200°F, Without the downward
sweep of gas through the housing, convection of the heat rising from the
“thimble could cause a rapid temperature increase and resultant damage to
the drive assembly. After the rod drives had been reinstalled and the re-
actor heated and filled with salt, the switches were tested by turning off

 
 

332

the gas flow. Since no alarms occurred, another method of measuring the
drive assembly was devised which, although not precise, was adequate for
operation. This was done by shutting off the integral drive motor cooling
fan and measuring the resistance of the windings of the fan motor. A
slightly greater than 10% ‘increase in resistivity. equaled. v50°F change.
winding ‘temperature. From the measured resistance and using the ‘temperature
"coefficient of resistance of the wire, a curve was plotted relating the
measured resistance to the approximate motor temperature. This value was
roughly related to the drive housing temperature. oo

In early operation, the control-rod servo system had not functioned
properly due to coasting of the regulating rod motor and shim locating mo-
tor. Brakes were installed in both of these (see 2k.5).

19.4.1 Rod Assembly in Thimble T-1 :

Figure 19.1 gives the rod drop times and fiducial zero values as well
as the maintenance history for the rod assemblies located in thimble T-1.
This was first made up of Rod R-1 and drive unit V-3 and was used as the
regulating rod, except for a four-month period, for the entire reactor op-
eration and consequently performed the bulk of the control rod service.
Other than replacement of faulty drive components, there was little diffi-
culty with this assembly... --

, The 1000-R: potentiometer position indicating potentiometer failed 3
times due to an open-resistence coil and 1 time due to a worn resistance
coil. This difficulty had been anticipated as it is a common failure for
this type. component in continuous service.

. One temperature switch failed due to an electrical ground at the wire
connections at the switch. The ground was created by pumping the switch
during assembly of the drive into the case, ’

There was an apparent.shift of 1/2-in. in the fiducial zero ‘position
in November of 1965. ‘The change was attributed to slippage of the chain
on the sprocket but examination.and testing failed to reproduce the slip.
The 1/2-in.. deviation was. recovered involuntarily in July of 1967 which:
would indicate that the exact cause. of the shift -is not known. The fidu-
cial zero position plot in Fig. 19.1: shows the gradual increase, ~1/2 inch,
 

 

 

 

333

in the length of the control rod from the effects of usage. The change
in length which occurred in September 1969, is the result of changing the
drive unit.

The rod scram times remained at 0.8 + .05 seconds from installation
until the spring of 1969. In March of 1969, the scram time increased to
1.03 sec for a 50-in, drop and also during this period, there was a failure
of the fine position synchro transmitter and the 1000-R pot. Analysis (see
19.5) of the rod acceleration.and velocity during a scram revealed that

. there was an area of drag in the lower 20 in. of the scram. From the above

 

evidence, the V-3 drive was replaced with the spare drive V-L4. With drive
V-b and rod R-1 in thimble T-1 the scram time returned to ~0.8 sec until
shutdown. A detailed inspection and maintenance program is planned for
drive V-3 but is as yet incomplete. oo
19.4.2 Rod Assembly in Thimble T-2

As shown in Fig. 19.2, the assembly in thimble T-2 was made up of V-2

 

drive, R-2 rod. This assembly was used as a shim rod, except for short
test periods, for the entire MSRE operation. Other than the mechanical
failures shown in Fig. 19.2, there were no operating difficulties.

The mechanical failures included two fine position synchro failures
and one potentiometer. Examination of one of the synchros (the radiation
level of the synchro was A10 mR/hr) revealed the failure to be the wiper
arm contact between the rotating shaft and the windings.

The fiducial zero history shown in Fig. 19.2 clearly shows the pro-
gressive stretching of the rod to be n1/2 in. from the time of installation
to the end of operations. ~~
19.4.3 Rod Assembly in Thimble T-3

‘This assembly was made up of V-1 drive and R-3 rod at the time of in-
'stallation as shown in Fig. 19.3. As indicated by the scram history shown
in the figure, this assembly was the most troublesome of the three MSRE
‘control rods. The drive units were removed during the precritical mainte-
‘nance period in the summer of 1965 to install the modified limit switches
described elsewhere. The No. 3 control rod was inspected at this time and
found to have a torn section in the upper hose, 28 in, below the flange.

The damage to the rod was the result of the failure of the upper roller

etter mat domme nh MAL nA +r corre 5 Sn fost man
 

 

 

334

in the No. 3 thimble which had jammed and would not rotate. The roller
and rod were repaired and after reassembly, the rod scram time was <0.8:
sec. | :
During the low power period of operation, it was found that after a
full scram the lower limit switch would not clear when the rod was with-
drawn. It was necessary to push the switch actuator by withdrawing the,
rod to the upper limit to clear the lower limit switch. It would function
normally until the rod was again scrammed. The bottom end of the limit:
switch push rod was found to be bent below the lower retaining bushing.
The rod had been bent by striking the lower housing flange as the result
of a wesk push rod spring. Repairs consisted of straightening the push rod
and installing a stronger spring. )

Later the control rod commenced to stick in the thimble at a point
A1-1/2 in. above the fiducial zero position. -The rod could be freed by
Jogging and would hang in no other position. Direct examination of the

thimble was not possible, but the exterior of the rod was examined and ap- °

peared to be in good condition. The difficulty appeared to be that a sharp
projection such as a broken weld at the throat section of the fiducial zero
position existed on which the rod could snag. However, when the R-3 rod
was replaced with the spare rod R-lU, it did not snag.

This rod operated within limits but the scram time increased slowly
from 0.85 sec in May 1967, up to 1.26 sec in December 1968. Examination
of both the drive and rod revealed no apparent defects. Replacing the V-1
drive with the V-2 drive unit in the T-3 position for test purposes made
little change in the scram time. Therefore a 1.5-1b weight was added to
the shock absorber assembly do the original V-1 drive unit and it vas re-
installed. This reduced the scram time to less than 0.9 sec.

The reactor was shut down in June 1969. by manually scramming all the
control rods. The assembly in thimble T-3 (R-k and V-1) was at 35.0 in.
and did not scram, 59 The rod was inserted 0.2 in. and scrammed again, this
time the rod dropped freely. Repeated attempts to make the rod stick fol-
lowed this incident but were unsuccessful. Fig. 19. L shows the results -of
scram tests at 2-in, increments ‘taken on June 2 before the rod was exam-

To correct this difficulty, Rod R-4 was removed and replaced by Rod
R-3. This was the rod which had earlier snagged in the thimble. Before
reinstalling it, the air exhaust tube (a possible cause of the snagging)
was filed smooth to eliminate all the sharp edges. The defective potenti-
ometer was also replaced on the drive (V-1). The greatly improved perform-
ance of this assembly (R-4 and V-1 in T-3) suggests that the trouble was
in the rod (R-lI) rather than in the drive, The extreme radioactivity of
rod 3 (R-3) made it impractical to examine.

Figure 19.4 also shows the results of drop tests conducted on August k4,
after all repairs had been accomplished for all three control rods. This

was the condition of the assemblies during the final period of operation.

19.5 Improved Rod Scram Testing

 

It was obvious from the No. 3 rod failure to scram that the method of
testing each rod by a single 50-in. scram was inadequate. The method
failed to expose any local areas of high drag. The incremental method of
testing, scram time vs sterting position, es shown in Fig. 19.4, showed
no region of excessive drag for any of the rods. In an effort to provide
a quick testing-procedure that would not require numerous rod drops, yet
would reveal regions of .abnormal drag, a procedure developed for the EGCR
was renovated. The output from the 1000-ohm position potentiometer was
amplified and transmitted by wire to the main ORNL area, where it was
passed through a filter with a 5-Hz time constant to remove transmission
noise, digitized at 2000 samples/sec, and stored on magnetic tape. The
data was then sent to the IBM-360 computer for smoothing and analysis by
a program especially developed for this purpose. This procedure when acti-
vated during a rod drop from 50 in. gave about 1800 data points during the
drop. From this velocity and acceleration curves were generated. Data
taken before repair of the sticking rod assembly (R-4 and V-1 in T-3) showed
a region of near zero acceleration between 26 and 40 in., in good agreement
with the incremental results shown in Fig. 19.4. After reinstallation, all
three assemblies were tested by both incremental drops and the single drop
computer analyzed method. Both methods showed reasonably constant acceler-
ations of 10 ft/sec? or more. A typical plot of acceleration vs position

is shown in Fig. 19,5.5°

The signel filtering and data smoothing that are required because of WF
the noise that is inherent in the position signal generator and transmis-
sion system made it impossible to detect with certainty a zero acceleration
zone less than about six inches long if it is more than sbout six inches
below the scram starting point. B

Revised criteria were established for the monthly testing of the rods.
This consisted of screaming the rods from 40 and 50 inches. These two
points were Just above the normal operating positions of the regulating
and shim rods. ‘The criteria were that the 50-inch scram time must be less
then 1.00 sec, the 40-in. scram time must be less than 0.90 sec, and the
acceleration curves must show no area which indicates abnormal drag. If
an area of high drag was noted, the rod would be dropped from a point within
this area. This scram time must be no more than 20% longer than normal for
that point. Prior to a fuel salt fill, the rods would be scrammed from 2k
inches, which is their normal position for a fill. The scram times from
this point must be less than 0.7 seconds and the acceleration curve show
no sbnormality.60

19.6 Maintenance Experience

 

Repairs performed on the drive units usually consisted of a simple
replacement of worn components which were readily accessible after the unit
had been removed from the reactor cell. In the event of major difficulties,
both a spare drive assembly and a spare control rod were available as re-
placement items.

It was possible to perform direct out-of-cell maintenance to the drives
without excess exposure to personnel. The radiation level was about 600
mR/hr at the drive case (the drive unit was removed from its case during
maintenance). The overall level of radiation at the drive mechanism was
gbout 200 mR/hr and, as an example, the level at the fine synchro trans-
mitter which was mounted on the gear case was about 30 mR/hr. Maintenance
on the control rod itself after criticality was very limited. Activity on
the upper hose was sbout 400 mR/hr at contact and the section containing

the poison elements was 20 R/hr at 18 in. after a two-year storage period.
 

 

 

 

339

Since the four drive assemblies were identical and the spare parts were
common to all the drives, the maintenance problems regarding replacement of
faulty components was not complicated. However, investigation as to the
reasons for slow scram times, even when the areas of high drag were located
(see 19.5), was by trial and error method. Past experience had shown that
certain areas such as the T/16-in,-diam air tube, on which the control rod
slides, could become slightly @mlled or bent. These areas were examined,
adjusted, and the unit operated on a test stand from the main console. The
final test was to reassemble the complete assembly in its normal operating
position in the reactor cell and proceed with the scram tests as described

elsewhere,

19.7 Discussion and Recommendations

The overall operation of the rods and drives was quite good. There
was only one time when a rod failed to scram in the four years of use. At
no time were reactor operations terminated specifically for control rod
maintenance. Construction of the assemblies was relatively simple since
very rapid response was not a requirement. The flexible controls rods were
adequate but the possibility of binding, breakage, etc., always existed.

It was possible to control the rod position closely, within 0.1 inch, from
the "fine" position indicator on the console but the exact physical loca-
tion of the poison elements was subject to weaknesses inherent to a semi-
confined flexible metal hose of this type. The only known position was at
the fiducial zero position in the thimble to which all other positions were
related.

It required about 12 hours to open the reactor cell access to approach
the control rod assemblies, the actual removal required about one hour,
Location of the drives in a more readily accessible location is recommended.

The manner of attaching the control rods to the drives and the drive

“units to the thimbles was hindered by (a) poor lighting at the bolt loca-

tion, (b) lack of space to insert more rigid tools to perform the bolting
which was done from a distance of about 18 feet, and (c) poor visibility

from the tool operator position at the maintenance shield, A modified
1340

external, rather than internal, bolted flange attachment between the rod

housing and thimble which is clearly visible is, recommended.
The "fine" position eynchro transmitters and potentiometers, such as
were used in these units should be of a more durable type. for extended

service,

20. FREEZE VALVES

- Ms Richardson
20.1 Introduction

The flow of salt in the MSRE drain, fill, and process systems was con-
trolled by freezing and thawing short plugs of salt in flattened sections
of 1-1/2-inch pipe, called "freeze valves." This method of control was
adopted because of a lack of a proven reliable mechanical valve. ' Although
mechani cal type valves would have had the advantage of faster action and
the ability to modulate flow, the "freeze valve" concept had a good record
of satisfactory performance, the freezing and thawing times were satisfac--
torily short, and the "off-on" type control did not impose any particular
hardship. . |
Design and development of the MSRE freeze valves began in 1960.50 The
basic design was established and had been tested by .the time the MSRE con-
struction had begun. However, considerable effort was expended at the re-
actor site before the valves were ready for routine operation. Successful
freeze valve operation is totally dependent on the manner in which the heat
and/or coolant gas is applied and controlled. The effect of the heaters,
type of service, local environment, etc., made it necessary to "tune" each
of the valves for its specific location. This effort continued until

criticality.

20.2: Description of the Design of the Freeze Valves

The valves were located in the system as shown in Fig. 20.1. All
twelve valves were similar and were made of 1-1/2-in. Sched-hk0 INOR-8 pipe.
The valve body, or flattened section, was cold-formed to make a 2-in.-long
flat, n2-in. wide, with a 1/2-in. internal thickness or flow area. A cool-
ing gas shroud was welded around the valve flat to direct the gas for
freezing the salt, The annulus formed between the valve body and shroud
was 1/2-in. The 3/b-in. gas inlet and exhaust lines were welded to the
shroud. See Fig. 20.2.

A pair of thermocouples located at the center of the valve inside the

air shroud, and a pair upstream and downstream just outside the air shroud

were connected to the control modules and to the cooling air modulating
controller. A single thermocouple spaced 5 in. from the valve centerline,
upstream and downstream on the top side of the 1-1/2-in. pipe, supplied
information for setting the manual heater controls. The heaters on either
side of the valve were individually controlled.

The thermocouples at the valve body were connected to an Electra Sys-
tems modular control network (six modules per valve) which operated auto-
matically at preset temperatures to maintain each valve within its ‘speci-
fied condition. The control network of the critical valves, described
below, included an automatic cooling air flow controller which maintained
the valve center at a constant temperature. The ultimate control, however,

remained with the modules.

20.3 ‘Description of the Operation of the Freeze Valves

Valves were usually operated in one of three steady-state conditions

or modes, i .
(1). Deep-frozen — the heaters were adjusted to maintain the valve at oO
~ 400—500°F without cooling air.
(2) Thawed  — The heaters were adjusted to maintain the valve at.
n1200°F without cooling air.
(3) Frozen ~ The heaters remained as in the thawed condition but

. the cooling gas flow was automatically adjusted to
hold the frozen valve in condition for a rapid thaw.

Operation of the valve required only a hand switch (or control action)
to freeze or thaw the salt. When the valve was switched to "thaw" from the
"frozen" condition, the air was cut off. and the heat supplied by the shoul-
der headers would melt the salt in the valve body. Similarly, when the
valve was switched to the "frozen" from the "thawed" condition, the air was
turned on and the salt in the valve body would freeze.

Each valve had three coolant gas flow conditions: off, full on (blast),
or reduced flow. (hold). The flow condition was determined by the tempera-
ture control modules. Although the exact module setpoints varied, for the
purpose of explanation, the following conditions are used: (See 20.4.4 for
FV-103 control.) oo . <
 

 

 

345

Module No. Setting Function
FV-1A1 850°F+, 800°F+ Shoulder temperature range
Fv-1a2 ~ T00°F¢ Low shoulder temperature
FV-2A1 S500°F Center temperature -- low alarm
| FV-2A2 ~ 1300°F+ Center temperature —- high alarm
Fv-3A1 850°F+, 800°F+ Shoulder temperature range
FV-3A2 TOO°F+ Low shoulder temperature

Assume that the valve was thawed at 1200°F., When it was switched to freeze,
the blast air (nok scfm) came on. When both valve shoulder temperatures
decreased to 800°F, the "blast" air was cut off and the "hold" air auto-
matically came on and held the valve shoulder temperatures between 800°F
and 850°F. If the shoulder temperatures continued downward for any reason,
all air was cut off at TOO°F by modules 1A2 or 3A2. If hold air flow was
insufficient and either of the shoulder temperatures exceeded 850°F, the
blast air automatically switched on by the action of the 1A1 or 3Al1 module
and reduced the temperature to 800°F.
On those valves used most frequently, FV-103, 105, 106, 204, and 206,

a temperature controlled differential air flow adjustment was provided for
the hold air in addition to the overriding on-off module control. These
controllers maintained the valve center at a constant temperature.

The normal valve condition during reactor operation with fuel salt was
as follows: (See Fig. 20.1.)

(1) FV-103 was frozen but in the event of an emergency drain, it was
required to thaw in less than 15 minutes.
oo (2) FV-105 and FV-106 were thawed and were required to remain thawed
even in the event of a power outage. In the event of an emergency fuel
drain, the salt flowed to both fuel drain tanks through FV-105 and FV-106.
A normal drain required freezing one of these valves prior to the drain to
direct the salt to the selected receiver tank.

(3) FV-104, and FV's 107 to 112 were deep-frozen.

(4) FV-20b and FV-206 were frozen during coolant salt circulation.
These ‘valves were required to thaw rapidly to prevent the coolant salt from

freezing in the radiator tubes.

 
 

 

 

346

During flush salt operation, FV-103 was frozen and FV-104 was thawed.
All other valves were deep-frozen.

FV's 107 to 112 were used only during shutdown periods for salt trans-
fers and additions. The thaw and freeze time for these valves was ‘not im-
portant. When not in use, they « were frozen or deep-frozen depending on the

operation in. progress.

20.4 Operating Experience

After the initial difficulties described below, operation of the
freeze valves was quite satisfactory. Table 20.1 is a tabulation of the

freeze and thaw cycles for each of the valves.

The valves which were required to melt rapidly, less than 15 minutes,
vere timed whenever the system was drained. These valves were FV-103, FV-
20h, and FV-206. Periodically they were tested under’ complete power fail-
ure conditions to assure that the valves would melt within the maximum time
allowed. The normal thaw time without power for FV-103 was 9-11 min, for
FV-20k4 and FV-=206 the normal thaw time was 12-1} minutes.
347

During early operation, FV-10L, FV-105, and FV-106, which were re-
quired to remain thawed (>850°F) for 30 minutes, were also tested under
the same power failure conditions. At an initial temperature of 1150°F,
the shortest period of time required to reach the salt freezing point was
36 minutes, with no salt flowing through the pipe.

It required approximately 8 hours to bring a valve out of the deep-
frozen condition (4OO—500°F) into the frozen condition. Heat was applied
selectively during the heatup to insure that the salt was melted progres-
sively from either end towards the center of the freeze valve. This was
to avoid having molten salt trapped between two frozen plugs and possible
denger of pipe rupture. The siphon pots were interlocked so that the pot.
temperature was required to be greater than 950°F before the associated
-valve could be thawed.

20.4.1 Testing of a Frozen Valve

After a valve had been frozen, it was pressure tested to assure that
a solid, leaktight frozen plug had been obtained. Early testing revealed
that due to the fuel drain line geometry, it was possible to have insuf=-
ficient salt remaining in the freeze valve after a drain to make up a solid
plug.

Investigation, using a glass pipe model, demonstrated that after the
drain line had been blown down through the head of salt in the drain tank,
the salt remained in the siphon pot and would not flow back into the valve
body to fill the void. After blowing down line 103, a 4 or 5 psi AP exist-
ed between the drain tank and reactor, when attempts were: made to equalize
this AP, the salt was forced out of the pot and past the freeze valve back
into the 103 line.

The method which was used most successfully was to reduce the reactor
system pressure by n1/2 psig which usually allowed sufficient flqw-back to
- fill the valve and make a good seal. A similar procedure worked satisfac-
torily for the transfer freeze valves.

20.4.2 Control Modules
During the initial checkout of freeze valve control circuits and gub-
sequent operations and tests, problems were encountered in the operation

of the modules which make up the Electra Systems Corporation alarm

 
 

 

 

>

348

monitor system. The setpoints drifted off the pre-set temperature trip
value, double trip points occurred, and failures to respond to alarm:sig-
nals were encountered. | |
Failures and malfunctions of the modules were traced. to inferior qual-
ity components and corrosion or oxidation at the printed circuit board con-
tacts. These faults were mostly eliminated by replacement of faulty com-
ponents, gold-plating all module contacts, and minor circuit changes. The
setpoints for the T2 modules were.checked at least once per year there-
after, In general, the modules remained within 15% of the preset values

after the initial difficulties were resolved.

'20.4,3" ‘Hest Control. to Freeze Valves

As installed, the heaters on either side of the freeze sections were
on a common. control. Also the heat supplied to the lower section of the
siphon pots adjacent to the freeze valve heaters was marginal due to the
manner of installation. Therefore, & balanced temperature gradient on ei-
ther side of the freeze plug was not obtained. Since the setpoints for:
the shoulder temperature control modules were adjusted for a balanced heat
distribution, it was difficult to maintain the valves within the module

limits. Separate heater controls were added which permitted separate con-

.trol of the heat to each side of the freeze plug. The heater wattage of
.the shoulder heaters was increased from 15 W/in? to 30 W/in?. These added

- features relieved most of the gbove difficulties.

The proximity of FV-105 to FV-106 (35 inches apart) closely related

the temperature effects of one valve to the other beyond the limits of good
.control: This could only be corrected by a change in the piping. Since

this was not practical, the problem existed throughout the reactor opera-
tion. This was especially true during a salt fill from FD-1 or FD-2 since
the hot salt-in line 103 was 19-3/k in. from FV-106 or 15-1/4 in. from -

_Fv-105.

20.L4.L4 Comments on Operation of Individual Freeze Valves

*'FV2103 — Since this wes the main fuel salt drain freeze valve, it
was required to thaw in less than 15 minutes. A coolant gas flow rate of
75 scfm was available for freezing. Heat was supplied to the valve from
the ambient temperature within the reactor furnace and therefore no. valve

heaters were required. Operation of this valve was complicated by a dual
349

set of operating conditions: (1) Immediately following a reactor fill, the
line-103 on the downstream side of the valve remained full of salt for a

period of several hours; (2) Line-103 was then emptied of salt leaving no

‘salt on the drain tank side. Figure 20.3 shows. the temperature distribu-

tion for both conditions.
In order to meet the fast thaw requirement and still meet both above
conditions, the module control points were set to function as listed below:

FV-103-1A1 -- ‘Blast air on at 1010°F4, no hysteresis — (shoulder
temperature. )

FV-103-1A2 -- Low temperature air cut off — L65°F¢+ — (shoulder
temperature).

FV-103-2A2 —- High alarm 600°F+ "2 of 3" alarm matrix (center
temperature).

FV-103-3A1 -- Blast air on at T65°F+ - T19°F+, 50°F hysterisis,
(shoulder temperature).
FV-103-3A2 —- Low temperature air cut off — 515°F+, (shoulder

temperature).

The "hold air" differential air flow controller was normally set to
hold the center temperature (TE-FV-103-2A1) at 375 to 400°F,

The temperature adjustments required for the proper valve operation
resulted in only one shoulder control module being effective in each con-
dition of the valve shown in the figure. During the initial freeze cycle,
the TS-FV-103-3A1 was the principal control and after the line-103 was
drained of salt, the TS-FV-103-1A1 was the key temperature control since
there was no salt below TS-FV-103-3A1. During a thaw cycle, the 1Al tem-
perature responded very slowly since the mass. of heat (reactor vessel) was

on that ‘side of the valve. The 3A1 temperature responded very rapidly

since the source of heat was through the frozen plug and the ambient tem-

perature. Selection of these temperature alarm points was carefully made
after many tests.

Once the valve conditions were established, FV-103 operated well ex-

cept for one unscheduled drain which occurred on ApriY 15, 1969. This was

caused by an upward 50°F drift of the setpoint of the FV-103-3A1 module
from T50°F to 810°F plus an administrative change of the FV-103-1A1 set-
point from 1010°F to 1050°F,

The upward drift had occurred prior to the previous freezing operation
and a short plug (<2 in.) of salt was formed in the valve. The controls
and freeze test indicated a good freeze. At the time of the incident, the
salt temperature was not at 1210°F for which the controls were originally
adjusted, but at 1110°F with the cooling gas flow controlling the valve
center temperature at 420°F,

Figure 20.4 is a graphic history of the incident and it can be seen
that, with the FV-103-1A1 adjusted to 1050°F, there was little if any warn-
ing to the operator prior to the melt. The valve normally melted when
TE-FV-103-1A1 was sbout 1030°F—10L0°F when the fuel salt was at 1210°F at
the reactor outlet. The 1Al module administrative change to 1050°F was
based on an untested theory that the valve should be adjusted on the re-
actor inlet salt temperature rather than the outlet. As long as the freeze
valve hed a normal 2-in. freeze plug, the cooling air could be adjusted to
maintain the valve within the normal operating range. In this instance,
due to short plug, the valve melted as a result of changing the cooling
air flow which initiated a heating cycle beyond the range of the cooling
air to control. The air flow was routinely adjusted 50°F upward when the
fuel salt was at a reduced temperature but the combingtion of raising the
1A1 alarm point, the short plug resulting from the 381 upward drift before
the previous freeze, and raising the cooling setpoint resulted in the fuel
drain.

FV=104 — This valve operated without difficulty since normally it
‘was deep-frozen or thawed, It was sufficiently spaced ‘away from the line-
103 so as to be unaffected by a fuel drain. See Fig. 20.1.

~'FV's 105 and 106. — FV-105 and FV-106 were difficult to control during
a fill or drain operation because of the proximity of the valves to each
other and to the 103 line which was common to both freeze valves. See
Fig. 20.1. - Heat conduction from the hot salt passing through line-103
strongly affected that valve which was to remain frozen. In an emergency
drain situation, both valves were thawed and the fuel would drain to both
tanks. A scheduled drain required that one of these valves be frozen to
direct the salt to the selected drain tank only. In several instances
during 8 scheduled reactor drain the frozen valve thawed which resulted

in an added salt transfer operation to put all the salt into the proper
tank. The condition wes most troublesome during a reactor fill operation,
a time-consuming function at best, when the frozen valve would go into
‘alarm and control interlocks would stop the fill or the freeze-valve thaw
with the system partially filled and drain the salt to both storage tanks.
By proceeding very carefully ‘during the initial stages of the £ill this
condition could, and usually was, overcome by stopping the fill with the
1103 line filled to above the tee and allowing the frozen valve to approach
equilibrium. However, the last failure of this sort occurred as late as
April 11, 1969.

A leak in the primary system became evident after the final system
drain of December 12, 1969 which appears to be in the vicinity of FV-105.
This is discussed in Section 5.

as FV-105 and FV-106 of being too close to each other. Since the valves
were always operated es a pair, either frozen or thawed, this did not cause
any difficulty. There were no operating difficulties with these valves
after criticality.

20.5 Recommendations

1.: Freeze valves of this type should be so located by distance or
separate lines so as to avoid any temperature interaction.

- 2. They should be so’ positioned that the adjacent piping is posi-
tively full of salt. The valves can be installed in a variety of ways,
vertically, inclined, etc., to. insure there are no void spaces in the piping.

-3. - Those valves which. are ‘not -critical should be simplified by elimi-

nating the automatic moduler control feature, - These valves would be less

 

“expensive, less ‘time-consuming to adjust, and easier to control by simple
" manual air control. Fo :

kL, The .automatic differential cooling gas controller should be con-
sidered for all critical valves. This feature greatly reduced the amount

 
 

 

 

 

354

of time required to maintain the valves within limits and reduced the
post~freeze thermal . cycling. oo

5. The shakedown period for adjustment of the valve temperature con-
trols at the reactor was time-consuming for a variety of reasons. Initially
the control modules were found to. drift off setpoint and had double trip
points. These difficulties were essentially, but not completely, elimi--
nated by local redesign. There were six control modules per valve for a
total of seventy-two individual modules to be maintained. Each module con-
tains two indicating lamps, "Alarm" and "normsl" which are wired in series
with the control circuit. There were frequent failures of these bulbs
vhich in turn affected the module function. Many of the operators had dif-
ficulty in understanding the functions of the modules and were at a loss
as to what corrective action was to be taken when an alarm sounded. Al-
though the Electra modular system succeeded in controlling the valves, a
simpler system is recommended. . oo :

6. Individual control should be providedfor each of the heaters which
affect the valve temperatures. An excess of heat is needed to. overcome heat
losses in.the valve area. Placement of the heaters should be given careful
consideration to eliminate cold spots in adjacent piping.

T. An adequate supply of cooling gas should be available to each
valve. A supply of 40-50 scfm for 1-1/2-in. pipe "blast air" cooling
would be sufficient for good control.

8. The modular control setpoints were established for normal 1210°F
reactor operating temperature at steady state. The critical "fast thew"
valve control setpoints were adjusted for this temperature as was the con-
trol point for the automatic cooling gas control. Deviation -from the nor-
mal temperature for which the control points were adjusted (within 75°F)
required adjustment of the cooling air flow only. This raised or lowered
. the valve center temperature to meintain the shoulder temperature control
modules within limits. During transient conditions, such as heatup of the
system, the valves were severely cycled because of a large temperature
gradient between two valve shoulders on the same valve. One shoulder would
be gbove the module elarm point and that control would turn on the blast
air. The other shoulder would be below the low temperature alarm point
and cut. all the cooling air off. The module controls would allow the

oC
 

355

velve to cycle back and forth across this range until the low temperature
shoulder would heat enough (VT00°F) to permit the differential controller
to control the air flow. In practice all air was manually turned off
during heatup until the valve shoulder temperatures were above TOO°F. The
valve then would remain in the frozen condition but heat much more rapidly
. and the thermal cycling would be greatly reduced.

21. FREEZE FLANGES
R. H. Guymon

21.1 Description

Mechanical-type joints were provided in the 5-in. salt piping inside
the reactor cell to permit major components to be removed for maintenance.
Figure 21.1 is a sectional view of the so-called "freeze flange" type of
joint used. The design was such that the "0" ring was in a relatively cool
location. A frozen salt seal protected the ring joint seating surfaces
from contact with salt which could cause corrosion when the salt was ex-
posed to moisture. Each freeze flange had six thermocouples; four were
located on a U-1/2-in. radius, 90° apart, one on a T-in. radius and one

on a 10.2-in. radius.

21.2 Operation

It was never necessary to. remove a major component and therefore one
important function of the freeze flanges was never tested at the MSRE,
Farlier tests on a prototype lange indicated that making and breaking
these could be done remotely without appreciable difficulty.

The leak rates of the five freeze flanges during early operation are
given in Table 21.1. Similar leak rates were observed throughout operation
except that one of the freeze flanges (FF-201) located near the point where
the coolant salt left the heat exchanger leaked more than the allowable
leak rate of 1 x 10-3 cm3/sec when salt was not in the piping and the cool-
ant system had been cooled down. This leak was measured at about 0.2 oC
em3/sec on August 2, 1966. The flange always became acceptably sealed when
the system was heated. -. oo

Although there was some variation between individual flanges and some
variation with time, the thermocouples located 4-1/2 in. from the centerline
of the pipe were usually between T50 and 950°F. Those on T-in., radii were
about 550 to 650°F and those at 10.2-in. were about 450 to 550°F. |

The thermocycle history is shown in Table 21.2. When it was decided
to extend the operation of the MSRE longer than the original plans, the

was restarted. After cycle 268, examination using dye-penetrant revealed
a crack in the bore in the ‘vicinity of the weld attaching the alignment
stub to the face of the flange. The crack appeared about the same after

the final thermal cycle, number s5ko.

21.3 Conclusions.

Lo , oo
The freeze flanges performed satisfactorily throughout the reactor

operation. The higher leek rate on FF-201 when cold caused some concern

but did not require repairs.

22. CONTAINMENT
P. H, Harley

22,1 Description and Criteria

Containment at the MSRE was required to be adequate to prevent the
escape of multicurie amounts of radioactivity or dangerous amounts of other
materials to the atmosphere. A minimum of two barriers was provided.

During operation, the primary barrier was the piping and equipment
which contained or was connected to the fuel salt system and off-gas sys-
tem. Block valves were installed in all the helium supply (cover gas)
lines to prevent backup of activity. Primary containment extended out the
off-gas lines and through the charcoal beds. The entire primary system
vas of all-welded construction with leak-detected flanged joints except at
a few less vulnerable locations where autoclave fittings were used. BEs-
sentially zero leakage was permissible from the primary system.

The secondary containment currounded the primary containment. It con-
sisted mainly of the reactor and drain-tank cells and appendages to them,
There are ~nT00 penetrations for service lines into the cells. Figure 22.1
is a simplified diagram showing the various type penetrations and methods
of sealing or blocking these.

Under conditions of the MCA, the secondary containment would be limit-
ed -to a pressure of 39 psig by the vapor condensing (see 22,4), The cell
temperature would rise to 260°F, Under these conditions the maximum al-
lowsble leakage rate as specified in the MSRE Safety Analysis Report SS was
1% per day of the secondary containment volume.

- During maintenance, the reactor was shut down and the amount of radio-
activity available for the chances of its release were considerably ‘reduced.
When the primary system was opened, the cells became the primary containment

with the high-bay area acting as secondary containment.
22.2 Methods Used to Assure Adequate Containment and Results

Most of the time the primary and secondary containment was operated
well below its design capabilities. Various means were used to assure that

containment would be adequate under the worst conditions.

The primary system was pressure-tested annually and the cell air ac-
tivity was continuously monitored as an indication that no leak had devel-
oped during operation. The secondary system leak rate was checked annually
at a positive pressure and was continuously monitored at normal cell pres-
sure (—2 psig) during operation. In addition to this, all primary and
secondary system block valves were tested annually to assure acceptable
leak rates. .

22.2.1 Primary System

Radiographs, dye checks, and other inspections were carefully reviewed
during construction of the primary system. All flanges had metal "O" rings
which were remotely leak-~detected by pressurizing the ring groove to 100
psig with helium. (See Section 1k of this report.) Although the system
was opened 33 times for fuel additions, graphite sampling, and maintenance
as indicated in Table 22.1, there was no leakage of any flange above the
allowable 10-3 cc/min while the reactor was operating.

In 1965 before starting nuclear operation, all of the block or check
valves were tested in place or removed and bench-tested. This was part of
the containment (primary and secondary) check list, Section LE of the MSRE

Operating Procedures. 22 The specified maximum leak rate on the primary
system valves was 1 to 2 cc/min at 20 psig. A number of valves in the
helium cover-gas lines had excessive leakage. This was due to damaged "O"
rings and/or they had foreign particles in them, usually metal chips from
machining. After cleaning and installing new "O" rings they had no detect-
able leakage. After reinstallation, the lines were pressurized and the
fittings or welds were checked with a helium leak detector.

These tests were repeated annually. The results are given in Table
22.2 along with results from tests of the secondary block valves which are
described later.

In addition to the above, an annual strength test was run on the pri-
mary system. This was normally done by pressurizing the fuel system, in-
cluding drain tanks, to 60 psig with flush salt circulating at normal oper-
ating temperature (1200°F). ‘No abnormalities were noted during any of
these tests.

There were no lesks in the primary system until after the final drain.
At this time a leek was indicated by an increase in cell-air activity.
Subsequent investigation showed that this was in the vicinity of one of
the drain freeze valves (FV-105). See Section 5 and Reference .25.
22.2.2 Secondary Containment

The criteria for the secondary containment was not as rigid as for

the primary containment. Small leaks could be tolerated but it was still
necessary to assure that containment was adequate for the worst conditions.
The methods used are described below.

Only one strength test was made on the reactor and drain. tank cells,
This was in 1962, soon after construction of the cells was completed. The
tops of the cells were closed temporarily by steel membranes and the pene-
tration sleeves were temporarily blanked off. The cells were then hydro-
statically tested separately at 48 psig (measured at the top of the cells).
A leak rate acceptance test was also made in 1962. The leak rate was ac-
ceptable, however, none of the penetrations had been installed by this
time, 56

Prior to power operation, the conteinment block and check valves were
tested in place or removed and bench-tested as described in the containment
startup check list (YE of the Operating Procedures).2? The specified maxi-
mum leek rate at the test pressure of 20 psig varied according to the lo-
cation of the valve but usually was set at 1 to 2 scc/min for helium cover
gas (primary containment), 5 to 10 sce/min for other gases and 3 to §
ce/min for liquids. A considersble number of leaks were found and repaired.

Leaks which occurred in the water system were mostly in the check
valves. . These were the result of foreign particles, apparently washed out
-of the system and trapped between the fixed and moving parts of the valves.
Two hard-seated valves An the water system had to be replaced with soft-
seated valves even though the seats were lapped in an effort to get them
to seal. One was a swing check valve in a water line between the surge
tank and the condensate tank. The other was a spring-loaded, hend-operated
vent ‘valve on top of the surge tenk.

The instrument-air block valves with few exceptions were found to be

satisfactory. There were numerous leaking tube fittings in the air lines,
 

365

Several quick disonnects on air lines inside the reactor cell and drain-
tank cell were found to be leaking when checked with leak-detector solu-
tion. These did not constitute & leek in secondary containment since each
‘line has a block valve outside the cell; but a leak here would affect the
cell leak rate indication when air pressure was on the line to operate the --
valve.

The butterfly valves in the 30-inch line used for ventilating the cells
during meintenence operations were checked by pressurizing between them,
The leakage measured by a flowmeter was excessive, and the valves had to
be removed from the system to determine the cause. There was considerable
dirt on the rubber seats, and one was cut. These seats were cleaned and
repaired. It was found that the motor drive units would slip on their
mounting plates by a small amount, thus causing a slight error in the indi-
cated position of the valve. Dowels were installed in the mounting plates
to prevent this. Small lesks were also found around the pins which fasten
the butterfly to the operating shaft. These leeks were repaired with epoxy
resin. -

The line from the thermel-shield rupture discs to the vapor-condensing
systems had numerous threaded joints that lesked badly when pressurized
with nitrogen. Each joint was broken, the threads were coated with epoxy
-resin, and the joint was remade. All joints were leaktight vhen rechecked
with leak-detector solution. ;

The cell pressure was then increased in increments and extensive soap-
checking and lesk-hunting were done. Alternate top blocks were installed,
and the cells were pressurized to 1 psig to lesk-check all membrane welds
with lesk-detector solution. ‘No lesks were found in the welds. With the
cells at 1 psig, all penetrations, pipe joints, tube fittings, and mineral-
insulated (MI) electrical cable seals subjected to this pressure were
checked with leak~detector solution. Numerous leaks were found in tube
fittings and MI ceble seals, Many of the leaks were stopped by simply
tightening the threaded parts of the seal. However, the lesk rate was
still about 4500 ft3/day, indicating some major leak that had not been
found. - |

 
366

All shield blocks were installed, the cells were pressurized to > psig, \o/
and leak-hunting continued. Three large leaks were ‘located. One was:
through the sleeve that surrounds the fuel off-gas line from the reactor
cell to a ventilated pit in the vent house; the sleeve was: ‘supposed to have
been welded to the line in the reactor cell but this had been overlooked.
Therefore, the sleeve was closed at the vent house, where it was accessible.
Another leek was in en instrument air line to an in-cell valve (HCV-523),
and the third was from the vapor-condensing system to the drain-tank steam
domes and out to the north electric service area through a.line that was
temporarily open. All penetrations, tube fittings, and MI ceble seals were
again checked with leesk-detector solution. Many MI cable seals which hed
- not leeked at 1 psig were found to be leaking, and some of those which-had
been tightened and sealed at 1 psig now leaked. Again, many. of the.seals
were tightened. As a result, several of the gland nuts split.and soldering
was required. All large leeks were sealed or greatly reduced, and meny of
the small leaks were stopped.
Leek-hunting and repairs were continued at 10, 20, and 30 psig. The
MI-cable seals as a group accounted for a large percentage of the remaining o
leeks. To stop small -legks which may not have been located, all MI-ceble
seals were coated with epoxy resin at the seals outside of the cells, This
- was done with the cell pressure at —1,5 psig so thet the epoxy would be:
drawn .into the seals. Teflon tape, used extensively on MI-cable seals,
other threaded pipe, and tube fittings, did not perform satisfactorily in
providing a gas seal. | te Lo
During the 30-psig test, large leaks were located in both component
coolant~pump-dome flanges using leak-detector solution. (One -of them was
audible.) The inlet and outlet valves to these domes were then closed and.
“the domes vere opened for work on the gaskets. The broad, flat, Viton-
rubber gaskets were found to be undamaged. The leakage was attributed to
inedequate loading pressure on the broad gaskets, and after they were nar-
rowed, no further leaks were observed. . oo a
Leak-rate date was then taken at 30, 20, 10, and -2 psig with the --
component-coolent-pump domes velved back into the system. These are plot-
ted in Fig. 22.2 along with curves which relate the ellowsble leakage at
various pressures to the allowable leskage at 39 psig (MCA pressure) for \./

The instrument air block valves were closed during these tests.

®%

The leek rates at —2 psig are those calculeted for the periods. fol-
lowing the pressure tests. The instrument air block valves were open during
these periods.

Subsequent ennual checks of the secondary containment consisted of:

(1) testing and repairing 811 block valves, (2) checking the lesk rate at
some elevated pressure (usually 20 psig), and (3) checking the lesk rate
while operating with the cells at —2 psig. The number of valves found
leaking during these tests are shown in Table 22.2. The measured leak rates
are given in Table 22.3.

During ‘operation of the reactor, the cells were maintained at —2 psig
and the leak rate was monitored somewhat continuously. On three occasions,
the reactor was shut down. due to indiceted high cell lesk rates. Further
 

369

investigation showed that leakage would not have been excessive during an
accident on any of these occasions. These are described below.

In the latter part of May 1966, a cell lesk rate of 100 scf/day at
—2 psig was calculated. The reactor was shut down and subsequent investi-
gation, including a 20-psig pressure test, disclosed a high leakage rate
through the thermocouple sheaths from the pressurized headers into the cells.
Since no significant leakage was detected from the thermocouple headers
outside the reactor cell, a flowmeter was installed in the nitrogen supply
line, This flow was included in the lesk-rate calculations. Prior to this
time the headers had been maintained between 5 and 50 psig by periodic pres-
surization. To decrease the purge to a minimum, the procedures were changed
to maintein the pressure at 5 psig. A containment block valve was installed
in the supply line. | }

In November 1966, the indicated call leak rate increased to 300 scfd
at —2 psig. Therefore, the reactor was drained on November 20. Leaks were
found in two air supply lines and one vent line used for in-cell air-operated
valves, One of the supply lines was capped since it supplied a valve which
was only operated periodically. A rotameter was installed in the other
supply line and the vent line was connected to the cell.

After measuring a cell leak rate of 45 scf/day during a 10-psig pres-
sure test, Run 10 was started. Early in thy run the new rotameter in the
air line indicated that the in-cell leak had increased. Rotameters were
also installed on three more air lines which were found to be leaking in
the cell. Later, the known leakage increased to 3500 scfd. Although the
calculated cell leak rate appeared to remain at about 50 scfd, Run 10 was
terminated in January .1967 because the possible error in the measured purge
rates in the lesking instrument air lines exceeded the permissible leak

rate. :

During the shutdown, the ‘air-line leaks were traced to quick discon-
nects in which neoprene seals had become embrittled. Out of 18 disconnects
with elastomer seals; eight disconnects, all near the center of the reactor
cell, were leaking. Seventeen of these were replaced with special adaptors.
sealed at one end by en aluminum gasket and at the other hy a standard

metal-tubing compression fitting. (One disconnect was not replaced be~
‘cause it was on & line that is always at cell pressure.) No similar

 
 

370

difficulties were encountered. After sealing the cell, the leek rate
was 50 scfd. oe EE

22.3 Discussion of Cell Leask Rate Determinations -

There were at least three ways of determining the cell lesk rate.
These were: - (1) a material balance plus compensation for pressure and tem-
perature using changes of the differential pressure between the cell atmos-
phere and an in-cell reference volume; (2) a material balance. plus compen-
sation for sbsolute temperature changes in the cells, and (3) an oxygen
balance,

The first method was used for calculating all official leak rates at
the MSRE, A discussion of each method follows,

Method 1 -- Material Balance Plus Compensation Based on the Differential
Between the Cell Pressure and the Reference Volume Pressure

In order to determine the cell leak rate in a ressonsble time, very
accurate indication of cell pressure changes was necessary. The instrument (-
used to determine the pressure changes was essentially a "U" tube manometer
(Fig. 22.3) called a "hook gage." Pointed shafts attached to micrometers
protruded through "o" ring seals in ‘the bottom of the chamber. . Readings
taken by adjusting the point of the shaft until it was at the liquid sur-
face and then reading the micrometer. Thus changes in water level corre-
sponding to cell pressure changes could be accurately measured. The origi-
nal gage had a range of 2 inches of water. A later model was obtained in
which the reference chamber could be moved a measured amount which gave a
range of 12 inches of water.

The changes in cell pressure were measured relative to that of an in-
cell reference volume. The reference volume was distributed throughout the
reactor cell and drain-tank cell in an attempt A) compensate for cell tem-
‘perature changes. It was found that very small leaks in the lines to the
reference volume could give large errors in the lesk-rate data, Welding
these lines eliminated this difficulty.

Approximately 5% of the contained volume was located outside of the

reactor and drain-tank cells end had no temperature compensation. This { J

included the 30-inch-diameter reactor cell ventilation duct (line 930) in
the coolant drain tank cell and the component-coolant-pump domes in the
special equipment room: These areas were sealed off as well as possible
to minimize temperature changes. At power there was still a considerable
amount of air leskage past these from the main blowers which caused day-
night temperature variations up to 20°F during winter months. The effect
of these temperature fluctuations was magnified by the presence of water
vapor in the cell air. (Since June 1967, there was a smell continuous
water leak (<1 gal/day) into the reactor cell.) This water evaporated in
the cells and condensed in the cooler sections of the containment (line 930
and the ‘component-coolant-pump gas cooler). This was periodically drained
from the system. In colder weather more water would condense,

Reactor power also had an effect on the indicated cell leak rate due
to cell temperature changes. When the reactor was teken from zero to full
power, gamma heating in the thermal shield and other equipment in the cell
caused the average cell temperature to increase 4 to 8°F and indicated a
high cell leak rate for approximately 2k hours. These changes were not
adequately compensated for by the pressure reference volume.

After the cells were closed following each in-cell maintenance period,
the containment was purged with dry N; to remove oxygen, so-the cell gas
started out dry. As the water evaporated, the initial cell leak rate was
usually high (75-130 scf/day has been calculated) but gradually decreased
to an equilibrium value in 5 to T days at which time condensate started to
form and was drained from the system. During this initial period until
condensate appeared, we relied on results of leak-testing at positive pres-
sure before the c¢ell was evacuated and purged. Due to the scatter in the
data and the relatively small change in pressure or temperature that repre-
sents ‘a large leak rate, considerable time was required to obtain data
from which reliable leak rate could be determined. To minimize the tem-
perature and other effects, initial and final data was usually taken at

. i

A change in cell pressure of 0.3 inches of water (0.01 psi) per day
or a change in the average temperature of 0.0L°F will change the indicated

the same time of the day and at the same operating conditions. Calcula-
tions of intervals of several days were more consistent than shorter
periods. Figure 22.4 is a plot of the data used to determine the leakage
rate at 30 psig in 1965.

. Typical flow rates for the material balances were: 9 scfd to the sump
bubblers, 13 scfd purge for the thermocouple header, and 0 to 1000 sefd
evacuation flow. Since the evacuation flow was normally the largest and
was changed more often, its signal was sent to the computer which inte-

grated it and each shift typed out a value for the total volume evacuated.

 

Method 2 =~ Using the Absolute Cell Pressures and Temperatures

This method was not used because the absolute cell pressure indication
was not as accurate as the indication of differential pressure by the hook
gage and compensating for temperature changes using absolute temperatures
did not give as consistent results as those obtained using the reference

volume,

"Method 3 -- Using an Oxygen Balance

The MSRE containment was purged with N; to keep the 0, concentration
<5% primarily to eliminate the danger of an explosion if an oil leek should
develop in the fuel-pump lubricating system. This made keeping an oxygen
balance on the cell appear as an attractive method of measuring the cell
leak rate when the cell was at a negative pressure.

The precision to which we could read the O, analyzer was only 0.1%
‘which is equivalent to N60 ft3 of air in the cell. With a leak rate nor-
‘mally n20 ft3/day, it became apparent that, the only accurate calculation
would be over very long time periods. In comparison to Method 1 (cell leak
rate using the cell pressure change and a flow balance), the oxygen balance
leak rate was consistently low by n15 scf/day. In fact, when the leak rate
calculated by Method 1 was <15 scf/day, the 0, data indicated a negative
leakage.

Errors involved in the pressure method of calculating the leak rate
would probably be associated with the rotameters; but this would imply a
25% error in rotameter calibration. All of the rotameters involved were
disconnected and bench-calibrated at least twice. They were found to be
accurate to well within 5%.

The containment cell was nominally at —2 psig, but just downstream of
the component-cooling pumps, the pressure was +6 psig. It was thought that
if gas were leaking out here and into the cell at a proportionately higher
rate, we might account for the anomaly. Simultaneous solution of the leak-
rate equations for this situation showed that although a solution was mathe-
matically possible, the in-lesk would have to be at ~n3% 0, and the out-leak
at 20% Op which is not practical.

These results caused us to think that something in the cell was chemi-
cally consuming some of the oxygen. Removal from the cell air of n2.5
scf/day of pure Op. would account for the lesk-rate discrepancy.

One - suggested mechanism for chemically removing the Op was by oil de-

composition. If some of the oil from the component-cooling pumps were con-

~tacting hot pipe (say at FV-103 or in control rod thimbles) it would prob-

ably at least partially decompose according to the approximate relation:

/

Clank) Bago) * (21) 02 = 15 Hy0 + 1k CO,

Cell air samples were taker to determine the CO, content and they showed
0.1% COs. This was at least three times higher than the CO; content in
air, but was less than one would expect to see if all the Op were being
consumed by oil decomposition.

The containment cell and support structure was composed primarily of
carbon steel so another prime suspected oxygen depletion mechanism was rust.

If all the missing 0, were being consumed to form Feps03, it would take

about 120 g/day of Fe. Since there is about 5000 ft2 of carbon steel sur-

face area in the cell, this would correspond to a corrosion rate of only

0.5 mils/year (neglecting the support structure and piping of component

coolant system).

 
 

 

 

 

376

This analysis led to the conclusion that enough oxygen was being re-
moved chemically by oil decomposition and rusting to produce the discrepancy
that existed between the different methods of cell leak-rate calculation.

22,4 Vapor Condensing System

An accident can be conceived in which molten salt and water could
simultaneously leak into the reactor or drain-tank cells. The quantity of
. steam produced could be such that the pressure in the cells would increase
above design pressure. A vapor-condensing system was provided to prevent
the steam pressure from rising sbove the 39-psig design pressure and to

retain the non-condensable gases. A 12-in. line connected the cells to the

vapor-condensing system, This line contained two rupture discs in parallel ’

(a’ 3-in. disc with a bursting pressure of 15 psig and a 10-in. disc with a
bursting pressure’ of 20 psig). The line from the rupture discs went to the
bottom of a 1800-ft3 vertical tank which contained ~1200 ft3 of water to
condense the steam. The non-condensable gases went from the top of this
“tenk to a 3900-ft3 retention tank. EE

The tanks were pressure-tested by the vendor to 45 psig. After being
connected to the reactor cell, the system was leak-tested at 30 psig during
initial testing of the reactor and drain-tank cells in 1965.

During the annual cell leak tests at pressure, the vapor-condensing
system was also pressurized. This protected the rupture discs and provided
an integrity test of the vapor-condensing system,

The water used in the vertical tank contained potassium nitrite-
potassium borate as a corrosion inhibitor. Based on annual samples, one
. inhibitor addition was made. There was no increase in the.iron concentra-
tion which indicated little or no corrosion. . oo

Initially Ly level probes were provided to assure proper water level.
However, after one of “the low level probes failed, a bubbler-type level
instrument was installed for measuring the level periodically.

‘Since there has been no unplanned increases in the pressure of the

reactor and drain-tank cells, the vapor-condensing system has not been used.

22.5 Recommendations

Leak~-checking the numerous valves required disconnecting many lines,
particularly tube fittings and autoclave connections. Disconnecting nu-
merous fittings greatly increases the probability that one or more will -
leak when connections are remade. For this reason, an effort should be
made in the design of the piping to minimize the number of disconnects
necessary for leak-checking. For example, nitrogen lines could be con-
nected as shown in Fig. 22.5 to facilitate checking both the safety valve
and the line inside the cell.

All block valves should be of high quality and soft-seated. Accessi-
bility to the items to be checked and the points used in checking them
should be considered. Flexibility should be provided in the lines which
must be disconnected.

Leaks from in-cell air lines cause errors in leak-rate calculations.
When disconnects are necessary, the effect of flux. on materials on con-
struction should be considered.

MI-cable seals of the type used at the MSRE (brass and stainless
steel) should be modified or enother-type used. Substituting ferrules of
teflon, graphite-impregnated asbestos, or other relatively soft material
for the brass ferrules may be sufficient .to prevent leskage through them.
However, radiation damage and sheath temperature must be considered. Stan-
dard pipe-threaded connections for stainless steel to stainless steel
Joints should be avoided where possible.

Teflon tape should not be used on threaded connections for a gas seal

nor on small lines where fragments.can enter the line and clog it or pre-

vent check valves from seating properly. All pipe, tubing, and valves
should.be cleaned internally prior. to installation.
MI-sheathed thermocouples are preferable to the type used. However,

if cost or other reasons (i. e. ‘seals at the ends) preclude using them, the

~initial design should provide. “for pressurizing the terminal headers and

measuring the leakage. Soldered Joints in the header system are recom-

mended where practical.
Gas analyzers used to continuously monitor the cell atmosphere should

be located in a warm ares to prevent moisture from condensing in them,

Fluids used in manometers or similar gages which are continuously
connected to the contained volume such as the hook gage should have a low
vapor pressure to avoid a significant loss during operation. The piping
to the gage should be pitched to prevent accumulation of water and should
not be connected to the bottom of temperature compensating or reference
volumes.

Temperature compensating volumes should represent the entire contain-
ment. The 30-in. cell vent line and the component-cooling system enclosure
(5% of cell volume) had no reference volume. The temperature reference
volume should be distributed throughout the cells. The MSRE used 6-in,
vertical pipes on a weighted volume basis in the reactor and drain-tank
cells. Smaller diameter piping with the same total volume might have given
a more representative temperature compensation,

The reference volume system external to the cells must have a minimum
volume and should be located in an area held at as constant a temperature
as possible. Sufficient cell temperature thermocouples should be located
in all sections of the containment to ensble calculation of average tem-
perature and temperature changes as accurately as possible.

If a sensitive cell pressure measuring device similar to the hook gage
is used in future reactor containment, it should be designed to meet sec-
ondary containment requirements so that block valves are not required.
However, if block valves are needed to isolate the instrument, a separate
circuit from the other block valves should be used. Pressure readings are
required above the pressures at which the other block valves are closed.
Safety jumpers could be used to keep this circuit open during cell-pressure

testing.

23. BIOLOGICAL SHIELDING AND RADIATION LEVELS

T. L. Hudson

The criterion for the MSRE biological shield design was that the dose
rate would not exceed 2.5 mrem/hr during normal operation at any point on
thie shield exterior that is located in an unlimited access area. - Since
the MSRE had to fit within en existing reactor containment cell and build-
ing, the shield design allowed for addition of shielding as needed to re-
duce rediation level at localized hot spots. The shielding calculations
are reported in Reference 57.

The reactor vessel was completely surrounded by a water-cooled, steel-
and-water-filled thermal shield. The thermal shield and fuel circulating
loop were located in the reactor cell. The top of the reactor cell had two
layers of concrete blocks. An annular space filled with magnetite sand and
water provided the shielding for the sides and bottom. See Fig. 23.1.

When the reactor was not in operation, the fuel was drained to one or
both drain tanks which were located in the drain-tank cell.  Magnetite con-
crete walls faced all accessible areas and the top consisted of two layers

of concrete blocks.

23.1 Radiation Surveys — Approach to Power

Extensive health-physics surveys of the reactor area were performed
during the initial approach to power. These surveys were made to bring to
light shield inadequacies. With the exception of the areas discussed in
the following paragraphs, the shielding was found to be adequate.
23.1.1 Coolant Drain Tank Cell

At 1 kW the scattéring of fast neutron and gamma rays from the reactor
cell into the coolant drain tank cell through the 30-in. reactor cell ven-
tilation line 930 caused radiation readings of 8 mrem/hr gamma and 50
mrem/hr fast neutron near the exit of the line. At 25 kW very high readings
were found again at line 930 (70 mrem/hr gamma, 600 mrem/hr fast neutrons
and 30 mrem/hr thermal neutrons). A wall of 16 in. of concrete blocks and
6 in. of borated polyethylene was build adjacent to the 930 line in the
coolant drain tank cell. In addition, the reactor off-gas line 522, in the

coolant drain tank cell was found to be giving a high background to the
area. At the end of the 25-kW run, the reading was 100 mR/hr at 1 in. from
the 3-in. thick lead shield around the 522 line. Later at higher power
levels it was determined that part of the radiation was from the drain-tank
vent line 561. Therefore this line was shielded with 3 in. of lead. Even
though shielding was added inside the coolant drain tank cell, the radiation
at the door (500 mR/hr gamma, 150 mrem/hr fast neutrons, 75 mrem/hr thermal
neutron) and halfway up the access ramp .(22 mR/hr gemma, 3 mrem/hr fast
neutrons, 32 mrem/hr thermal neutron (was high during full-power operation.
This area ‘was clearly marked with radiation zone signs et the entrance to
the ramp and the door at the bottom of the ramp was locked during nuclear
operation to prevent entry into the cell.

23.1.2 North Electric Service Area }

When the reactor power was raised to 1 MW in April 1966, the radiation
level in the North Electric Service Area (NESA) was found to be high: 20
mR/hr on the balcony and 8000 mR/hr at the west wall. Investigation showed
that there was radioactive gas in the lines through which helium is added
to the drain tanks. “Two check valves in each line prevented the gas from
getting beyond the secondary containment enclosure, but the enclosure, of
1/2-in. steel, provided little game shielding. The pressure in the fuel
system at that time was controlled by the newly installed pressure control
valve with rather coarse trim, and the pressure fluctuated around the con-
trol point (normally S psig) by + nog. These pressure fluctuations caused
fission product gases to diffuse more rapidly into the drain tanks and back
through the 1/b-in. lines through the shield into the NESA. The radiation
level was lessened by installing a temporary means of supplying an inter-
mittent purge to the gas-addition lines to sweep the fission product gases
back into the drain tanks. During the June shutdown, a permanent purge
system was installed to supply a continuous helium purge of TO ce/min to
each of the three gas-addition lines. . This was proved successful by sub-
sequent full-power operation in which the general background in the NESA
was <1 mR/hr.

Transmitter Room — During the radiation survey at 5 MW a hot spot of +

30 mR/hr gamma was found on the southwest corner sbout 4 ft above the floor.
 

383

A 2-ft by h-ft by 1-in. thick lead sheet was attached to the wall over the
hot spot and a radietion zone was established.

Vent House — During the. initial approach to full power, stacked con-
crete blocks were added to the floor area of the vent house, over the char-
coal beds and between the vent house and the reactor building to keep dose
rates low. Very narrow beams coming from cracks were shielded with lead
bricks. Even so, the background radiation level in the vent house was
nT mR/hr at full power. The vent house was established as a radiation
zone area. . oo

Water Room — Induced activity in the treated water rose to an unex-
pectedly high level during Run k4. The activity proved to be 12.4 hr 42k
produced in the corrosion inhibitor. A survey of possible replacements
for potassium led to the choice of lithium, highly enriched in the 7Li iso-
tope to minimize tritium production. See Water System (Section 12) of this
report for additional details. -

Top of Reactor Cell — It was expected that additional shielding would
be required directly above the reactor, where there are cracks (v1/2 in.)
between the shield blocks. During a full-pover run in July 1966, two very
narrow beams of y with neutron radiation were found between cell blocks for
the first time. These read up to 10 mR/hr gamma and 60 mrem/hr fast neu-

tron. They were properly marked.

- 23.2 Radiation Levels During Operation

 

During operation at full -pover, the radiation levels in. all opera-
tional areas were acceptable. Some narrow beams were noted from time to
time. ‘These were mainly in ‘the vent house. Due to induced activity in the
treated water, areas near large ‘equipment such as the surge tank and heat
exchanger were treated as radiation zones, Periodic radistion surveys have
not disclosed any apprecisble changes in radiation levels,

Some typical radiation readings inside the shielding are given in
‘Table 23.1. Changes in radiation levels following a shutdown from power are
shown in Figs. 23.2, 23.3, and 23.4, |

24, INSTRUMENTATION.

R. H. Guymon

2k.1" Introduction

It is not within the scope of this report to cover in detail the per-

formances of all instrumentation. An attempt has been made to review it

from an operational viewpoint and “report significant items. Information

on instrumentation which has been given in previous sections on the perfor-

mance of the entire plant or individual systems and components will not be

. repeated here. The performance of the on-site computer is covered in

Reference 58.

24,2 Description
Most of the MSRE instrumentation wes of conventional type found in
other reactors or chemical plants. Emphasis was placed on assuring ade-
quate containment and reducing radiation damage. All circuitry was de-
signed to fail safe. A very brief f description follows.
24.2.1 Nuclear Instruments -

The primary elements of all of the nuclear instruments were located

‘in a 36-in.-dia. water-filled thimble which extended from the high bay

through the reactor cell to the vicinity of the reactor vessel. (See

) Fig. 2k,1.)

Three uncompensated ion chambers and their associated fast-trip com-
parators provided safety instrumentation for scramming the control rods.
(High reactor outlet temperature - also caused a rod scram.) These .were used
in a two-out-of-three configuration. i

“Two fission chambers were provided. These chambers had automatic po-

~ sitioning devices. Their count rate and the effect of their position were

factored into a signal which was. recorded on a 10-decade logarithmic power

) recorder. They were used to provide rod inhibit, rod reverse, and other

control interlocks.

Two compensated ion chambers were used for servo control of the regu-
lating rod and for some interlocks. The power was recorded on a linear
recorder. Seven decades were covered by means of manual range selector
switches.

. One high sensitivity BF3 chamber was provided for power indication
during filling of the reactor.
24.2.2 Process Radiation Instruments.

Two kinds of detectors, ion chambers and Geiger Mueller tubes, were
used to indicate the level of activity in various process streams and to
provide necessary interlocks.

24.2.3 Health Physics Monitoring

Gamma. radiation was monitored by seven monitrons located throughout
the building. The air contamination was monitored. for beta-gamma emitting
particles by seven constant air monitors. The building evacuation system
operated when two or more monitrons or two or more constant air monitors
from a specific group of instruments detected a high level of radiation or
air contamination.
24.2.4 Stack Activity Monitoring

The containment stack air was checked for beta gamma, particulates by
passing a side stream through a filter paper and monitoring the activity
~ with a GM tube. After passing through the filter paper, the gaseous sample
passed through a charcoal trap which was monitored by another GM tube to
detect iodine. A second side stream passed through another filter paper.

‘This was monitored for alpha particulates using a thallium-actuated zinc

sulfide screen detector.

24.2.5 Temperature Detection oo

One thousend seventy-one chromel-alumel thermocouples (some of which
were installed spares) were provided for temperature indication. All of
the salt thermocouples except seven were located on the outside of the lines
or equipment. The seven in-thermocouple vells were located as follows:

“one in the reactor neck; one and two spares in the radiator inlet line;
and, one and two spares in the radiator outlet line. The more important
temperatures were displayed on single or multipoint recorders or indicators.
Readout of others was accomplished by means of a scanner system which al-

lowed the signals from up to 100 thermocouples to be sent to a rotating

‘mercury switch and subsequently to an oscilloscope for display. A switch
allowed selection of any one of five groups of 100 signals.
24,2.6 Pressure Indicators

Most of the remote indicating pressure and dp instruments were pneu-
matic or electric force elements. When containment was required, the vents
were referenced to atmospheric pressure through rolling diaphram seals.
Strain gage and Bourdon pressure gages were used.extensively. .Small changes
in reactor cell pressure were determined using a "hook gage". This was es-
sentially a water manometer with a micrometer for accurately reading changes
in water level.
24.2.7 Level and Weight Indicators

Bubbler type level instruments were used for measuring the salt levels
in the fuel pump, coolant pump, and overflow tank. A float-type level in-
strument was also installed in the coolant pump. The drain tanks were sus-
pended by pneumatic weigh cells to determine the amount of salt that they
contained. In addition to this, two resistant-type single-point level
probes were provided in each drain tank.. |

Sight glasses, floats, bubblers, dp cells, etc. , were used in the
auxiliary systems. )
24.2.8 Flow Measurement

No flow instrument was provided in the fuel salt loop, however a ven-
turi meter was installed in the coolant salt loop. This was a standard
venturi with a NaK-filled dp cell. Flows in auxiliary systems were meas-
ured by orifices, capillaries pitot tubes, rotameters and matrix type flow
“elements.
24.2.9 Miscellaneous

A semi-continuous mass spectrometer was used to monitor the coolant
air stack for beryllium. Other instrumentation included the following:
pulse-type speed elements, ammeters, voltmeters, and wattmeters for the
salt pump motors; potentiometer and synchro position indicators for the
control rods, fission chambers, and radiator doors; oxygen and moisture
analyzers for the helium cover-gas system; and an oxygen analyzer for the

cell atmosphere.

24,3 Initial Checkout and Startup Tests

A comprehensive functional checkout of the control, safety, and alarm
instrument was made by Instrument and Controls. personnel prior to operation
‘of each system, Although some design and wiring errors were found, these
were of minor nature and were easily corrected. In general, the quality of
installation was excellent. The following were included in this checkout:
the setpoints of all switches were adjusted to the proper values; contin-
uity and resistance checks of all thermocouples were made; the location of
each thermocouple was determined by heating the thermocouple and measuring
the voltage at the patch panel; and the continuity of all eircuits was
checked and all recorders were put into operation. Most of this was done
as construction was completed or as the instruments were put into service.

Prior to the first circulation of flush and coolant salts, e complete
operational - check was made of all instruments scheduled to be used. This
was done following the instrument startup check list.22 This involved:

(1) a complete checkout of all circuits. This was done by changing the
variable or inserting a false signal at the primary element and assuring
that all circuitry functioned at the proper setpoints; (2) a complete check
of the patch panel to assure that all thermocouples were connected to the
proper readout instrument and that the operational records were up to date;
(3) a complete test of all standby equipment to assure that it would start
if needed and would function properly; (4) a complete inspection to assure
- that no switches were inactivated or jumpers installed; and (5) tests to
assure that critical equipment functioned properly, such as rod drop times.
~ This instrument startup check list was repeated approximately every
year, Early tests revedled errors in wiring, setpoints which had drifted,
and other instruments which did not function properly. Later tests indi-
‘cated setpoints Hh be reset and occasionally a malfunctioning
instrument, nr

Most “of the troubles which ° were discovered by doing the instrumentation
startup check lists were corrected immediately. Therefore records are in~

~ edequate for statistical. analysis.

2h.h Periodic Testing

Due to the importance of some instruments or circuits, they were also
tested periodically during operation. As indicated by the sections which
follow, these tests did not reveal many serious troubles which needed cor-
rection. They did provide assurance that the circuits should function if
needed. In determining the amount and frequency of testing, careful con-
sideration should be given to the above weighed against the harm done to
equipment due to repetitive testing and the possibility of interruption of
operation. Rod scrams, load scrams, and reactor drains occurred at the
MSRE due primarily to testing of equipment or instrumentation.

The periodic tests made at the MSRE and the results of these tests
are given below.

"24,4.1 Nuclear Instruments

A complete check of all nuclear instruments was made each month during
nuclear operation. These were done by Instrument and Controls personnel
using Section 8A of the Operating Procedures.?2 All tests were satisfac-
tory except those listed in Table 2k.1. |
2h.k.2 Process Radiation Monitors

The process radistion monitors were tested each week during operation
by inserting a source near the primary detector and noting that each con-
trol interlock functioned properly and that all annunciations occurred.
All tests were satisfactory except those listed in Table 24.2. Some early
difficulty was encountered in that the hole in lead shielding for inserting
the source was not properly placed.
oh 4,3 Personnel Radiation and Stack Activity Monitoring

Periodic tests of the health physics monitors and stack activity in-
struments were originally done by MSRE personnel per Operating Procedure
8C.22 This was later taken over by other ORNL groups. The original sche-
dule for the health physics monitors was to meke a source check of each

"instrument weekly, a matrix check monthly, and a complete evacuation test
semiannually. As confidence in the instruments was established, the fre-

quency of these tests was reduced to monthly, quarterly, and semiannually.

The stack monitors were originally tested with a source each week.
Due to their excellent performance record, this was later reduced. to
monthly tests. : :

Troubles encountered were repaired immediately.
2k.b.h Safety Circuits

Periodic checks were made of all circuits and instruments designated
by the Instrument and Controls group as being safety. These included rod
scram circuits, fuel pump and overflow tank pressures and levels, helium
supply pressures, emergency fuel drain circuits, reactor cell pressures,
coolant pump speeds and flows, radiator temperatures and sampler-enricher
interlocks. These tests involved simulating a failure end checking as much
of the circuitry as possible without interrupting operations. At first
these were performed weekly, then all except the rod scram checks were
changed to a monthly basis. All instruments functioned satisfactorily ex-
cept those indicated in Table 24.3.

24.5 Performance ‘of the Nuclear Safety Instrumentation

These instruments proved to be very relisble. There were periods when

an abnormal number of spurious trips occurred. Many of these were believed

 

to have originated in faulty, vibration-sensitive relays in commercial elec-
tronic switches which provided the high temperature trip signels. Another
possible source was the chattering of the relays which: change the sensi-
tivity of the flux amplifiers in the safety circuits. “Correction of the LL
chattering end elimination of noise producing components elsewhere in the.”
system reduced-the frequency of these to a very tolerable-level.

~The fast trip comparators were found to be inoperative if a suffici-
ently large signal was applied to the input. A diode was added to the fast
trip comparator modules to eliminate this difficulty.

Operetion of the relay matrix in the nuclear system generated con-
siderable noise, making it difficult to reset the safety-system channels.
The resistor-diode combination for damping the voltage induced by relay
operation was replaced by a Zener diode and a diode combination that was

more satisfactory.

In the summer of 1967, the 1-kW 48-V-dc to 120-V-ac inverter, which
supplies ac power to one of the three safety channels, failed during
switching of the 48-V dc supply. It was repaired by replacement of two
power transistors. During this same period the output of the ion chamber
in safety channel 2 decreased drastically during a nonoperating period, and
the chamber was replaced prior to resumption of operations. The trouble
proved to be a failure in a glass. seal that allowed water to enter the mag-
nesia insulation in the cable, which is an integral part of the chamber,
A period safety amplifier failed when lightning struck the power line to
the reactor site, and a replacement emplifier failed as it was being in-
stalled. The field-effect transistor in this type of amplifier was suse
ceptible to damage by transient voltages, and it was found that under some
conditions, damaging transients could be produced when the amplifier was
removed from or inserted into the system. A protective circuit was de-
signed, tested, and installed. The module replacement procedure was modi-
fied to reduce the possibility of damage incurred on installation of the
module. Two relays in the safety relay matrices failed, both with open
coil circuits. A chattering contact on the fuel-pump motor current relay
caused safety channel 2 to trip several times before the problem was over-
come by paralleling two contacts on the same relay. A defective switch on
the core outlet temperature also caused several channel trips and one re-
actor scram before the trouble was identified and the switch was replaced.
A wiring ‘error in a safety circuit was discovered and corrected. Interlocks
had recently been added in the "load : scram” channels to drop the load when
the control rods scram. A wiring design error resulted in these interlocks
- being bypassed by a safety . jumper. Although the circuits were wired this
-way for a time before being discovered, the scram interlocks were always

operative ‘during power operation, since the reactor cannot go into the
"Operate" mode when any safety jumper is inserted.

Late in 1965, the power ‘supply to the model Q-2623 relay safety ele-
ments was changed from 115-V-ac to 32-V-de. This was done to eliminate
ac pickup on the other modules through which the relay coil current was
routed. The 115-V-ac relays were not changed at this time. These func-
tioned satisfactorily until the summer of 1967 when two of the 15 relays
failed. By the end of 1967, seven had failed, all with open circuits or

 
 

 

 

400

safe conditions. In April 1968, all 15 were replaced with relays designed
for 32-V-dc operation. Soon after instellation, 3 of these failed due to
contact welding (unsafe condition). This was apparently due to early
failure of defective relays. There were no more failures during extensive
tests made at this time or during subsequent operation. Starting Septem-
ber 30, 1968, daily tests were conducted on the entire rod scrams relay
matrix to detect single failures. (The matrix had been tested weekly be-
fore that.) Noise suppressors were installed across some of the non-
safety contacts of these relays to alleviate the noise which had sometimes
caused difficulty during in-service tests.

24,6 + Performence of the Wide-Range Counting Channels

Initial criticality tests disclosed that the neutron flux attenuation
in the instrument penetration did not follow an ideal exponential curve.
The deviation was too large to be adequately compensated for by the verni-
stats in the wide-range counting channels. This is illustrated by curve
‘A of Fig. 24.2 which shows fission counter response (normalized count rate)
vs withdrawel from the lower end of the penetration in guide tube 6. It
was reasoneble to conclude from this, and from similar curves, that the
excess neutrons responsible for the distorted part of the curve were en-
tering the penetration along its length. The count rates in other guide
tubes nearer the upper helf of the penetration were even more distorted
than curve A. Since & flux field with attenuation per Curve A precluded
successful operation of the wide-range counting instrumentation, shields
of sheet cadmium were inserted in guide tubes 6 and 9 to shield the fission
chambers from stray: neutrons. Curve B of Fig. 24,2, normalized count rate
vs distance, shows the improvement for guide tube 6. |

Reactor period information from the wide-range. combing channels in-
hibited rod withdrawal and caused rod reverses. Reactor period signals
from counting channels operating at low input levels are characterized by
"slow response. This inherent delay produced a problem with servo-controlled
rod withdrawal during start. In a servo-controlled start, the demand sig-
nal caused the regulating rod to withdraw until the period-controlled "with-
draw inhibit" interlock operated. If the period continued to decrease, the

"reverse" interlock acted to insert the rods in direct opposition to the
servo demand. These "withdraw inhibit" and "reverse" trip points were
originally established at periods of +20 and +10 sec respectively. The
delayed low-level response of the "inhibit" interlock allowed sufficient
incremental rod withdrawal to produce a 10-sec period and thus cause a re-
verse. The situation was ‘aggravated ‘by coasting of the shim-locating motor
in the regulating rod limit switch assembly.. . To correct this, the "withdraw
inhibit" and "reverse" period trip points were changed to +25 and +5 sec,
respectively, an electro-mechanical clutch-breke was inserted in the shim-
locating motor-drive train and dynamic -breking circuitry was installed for
the regulsting rod drive motor.

Throughout operation, difficulty was experienced with moisture pene-
tration into the fission chambers. The cause was diagnosed as excessive
strain and flexing of the tygon tubing sheath on the electrical csbles.
The average lifetime was about 6 months prior to July 1968. At this time
the type of tygon tubing used to cover the cable and the method of sealing
the chamber connections were changed. This seemed to improve the moisture
resistance. i

In early 1967, a failure occurred due to a short in the cable to the
preemplifier. The drive tube unit was modified to provide for controlled
cable bends and there were no reoccurrences .of this type of difficulty.

24,7 Performence of the Linear Power Channels

The linear power channels and rod servo instrumentation performed very
well throughout the operation. When the fuel was changed to 233y, the rod-
control servo was modified to allow an increase -in the servo dead band to
compensate for the more rapid flux response of the reactor.

The compensated ion chambers use a small electric motor to change com-
pensation. Early in 1966 one of these motors had to be replaced.

A water leak occurred in one of the compensated ion chambers in the
summer of 1969. When it was examined, numerous leaks were found along the
seam weld in the 321 stainless steel bellows sheathing the cable, and the
aluminum can at the outer support ring was honeycombed by corrosion. (The
water in the instrument shaft contained lithium nitrite buffered with boric
acid for inhibition of corrosion.)
 

403

24,8 BFz Nuclear Instrumentation

Because of very unfavorable geometry, the strongest practicable neu-
tron source would not produce 2 counts/sec from the fission counters in
the wide-range counting channels until the core vessel was approximately
half full of fuel salt; neither would it produce 2 counts/sec with flush
salt in the core at any level. This was the minimum count rate required
to obtain the permissive "confidence" interlock which allows filling the
core vessel and withdrawing the rods. Therefore a counting channel using
a sensitive BF counter was added to establish "confidence" when the core
vessel was less than half-filled with fuel salt. This was installed early
in 1966. The chamber had to be replaced in the summer of 1967 due to mois-

ture leakage into the cable. No other troubles were encountered.

24.9 Nuclear Instrument Penetration

The nuclear power produced at the MSRE was determined by an overall
system heat balance. All nuclear power instruments were calibrated to agree
with ‘this primary standard. During extended runs at higher powers, the
nuclear instruments indicated 15 to 20% higher than the heat balance. This
was found to be due to a rise in water temperature in the nuclear instru-
ment penetration which apparently changed the attenuation characteristics
of the water. In June 1966, a heat exchanger system was placed in operation
to cool the water which reduced the temperature change from zero to full

power: to 18°F from - 72°F and reduced the difference in the two power meas-

urements to about 5%.

24,10 Performance of the Process Radiation Monitors

. The process radiation monitors proved very relieble. No radiation

elemerits had to be’ replaced during the entire operation. Occasional re-

- pairs were necessary on the electronics. One rod and load scram resulted

from a false signal from one of these monitors (RE-528).

24,11 Performance of the Personnel Radiation =
Monitoring and Bullding Evacuation System

During early testing it wes found that there were some areas where
the building evacuation horns could not ‘be heard. Two additional horns
and four additional beacon alarm. lights were installed. Other than oc-
casional minor repairs, the system has. functioned setisfactorily.

24,12 Performance of the. Stack Monitoring System

The. stack monitoring system was very relisble.. The manual range

- switching made it difficult to interpret data from the recorder charts and

the :Rustrak recorders were very inconvenient to use.

24,13 Performance of Thermocouples-and the: h
Temperature Readout" ~gnd~Control- Instrumentation

A total of 1071 thermocouples were installed at the MSRE. Of these,
866 were on salt systems (351 on the circulating loops and 515 on the drain
tanks, drain lines, and freeze valves). Of the 1071, only 12 have failed
in five years of ‘service. Five others were demaged during construction and

maintenance. A breekdown of the failures is given in Table 2k.k.

Only three thermocouple wells were provided in the circulating salt
systems, one each in the coolant radiator inlet and outlet pipes: ‘and one
in the reactor neck, The’ remaining thermocouples were attached to the pipe
or vessel walls. The thermocouples on the radiator tubes were insulated
to protect them from the effects of the high-velocity air that flows over
them during power operation; the others were not insulated and thus were
subject to error because of exposure to heater shine and to thermal con-
vection flow of the cell atmosphere within the heater ‘insulation. In
March 1965, with the fuel and coolant systems circulating salt at isothermal
conditions, a complete set of readings was taken from all the thermocouples
that should read the temperature of the circulating salt. A similar set of
data was teken in June 1967 at the start of Run 12, The results of the two
sets of measurements are shown in Table 24.5. Comparison of the standard
deviations for the radiator thermocouples. with those for the other thermo-
couples shows the effect of insulation on reducing the scatter. Comparison
of the sets of data taken over two years spart shows very little change,
certainly no greater scatter. Figure 24.3 shows that the statistical dis-
tribution of the deviations on individual thermocouples from the mean also

changed little in the two years.

407

The scatter in the various thermocouple readings was reduced to an
acceptable level by using biases to correct each reading to the overall
average measured while both fuel and coolant systems were circulating salt
at isothermal conditions. - These biases were entered into the computer and
vere automatically applied to the thermocouple readings. The biases were
revised at the beginning of each run and were checked when isothermal con-
ditions existed during the runs. Generally the biased thermocouple readings
were relisble. However in a few cases, there were shifts which caused cal-
culational errors.

During early operation the thermocouple scanner gave considerable dif-
ficulty due to 60-cycle noise pickup, poor stability, and drifting of the
salvaged oscilloscopes. Refinements were needed in design to allow better
identification of scanner points and provide a means by which the operator
could calibrate the instruments. After these were corrected, the system

operated very satisfactorily. The rotating mercury switches lasted much
longer than the expected 1000-hour mean life. One switch failure occurred
when the nitrogen purge gas was inadvertently stopped.

Single point Electra Systems alarm switch modules were used for con-
trol of freeze valves and for other alarm and control actions. These gave
considerable trouble during early operation due to drifting or dual set-
points and general maloperation. A number of modifications were made to
correct these. Printed circuit-board contacts were gold-plated to reduce
contact resistance, the trim pots used for hysteresis adjustment were re-
placed with fixed resistors, and resistor values in modules having ambig-
uous (dual setpoints were changed to restore the proper bias levels. These
changes, together with stabilization, by aging, of critical resistors in
the switch modules and more rigorous periodic testing procedures improved
the performance. A check shoved that out of 109 switch setpoints, 83% had
shifted less than 20°F over a six-month period. Multiple setpoints still
occurred and various other failures were encountered. During 1968 and
1969, records were kept on the failures of indicator lights on these mo-
dules. There were about 50 failures per year. This was important because

a burned-out light bulb could cause alarm or control action.

24,14  Performesnce of Pressure Detectors

Most .of the pressure instruments at the MSRE performed very well. Dif=-
ficulty was encountered with the differential pressure cell used to obtain
the pressure drop in the helium flow ‘through the charcoal beds .(PAT-~556).

The span and zero settings shifted badly although the pressure capability
had never been exceeded. Three dp cells failed in this service. Two of

‘these were removed, tested, and inspected without determining the cause of.
~ the ‘trouble. The last replacement functioned satisfactorily at first but

then gave similar difficulties. It is still installed.

24,15 Performance of level Indicators

The bubbler-type level instruments used in the fuel pump overflow tank
and coolant pumps performed well. More details are given in. Sections 5, 8

and 6.5. Some difficulty wes encountered in controlling the purge flow un-

til the throttling valves were replaced.

A high and. low level resistance “type level prove. was provided on. each o

drain tank, During early operation the excitation and signal -cable leads

on both probes of the fuel flush tenk failed. These failures were caused

by excessive temperature w which caused oxidation and embrittlement of the

copper-clad, mineral-insulated copper-wire ‘cables. These cables were de-

signed on ‘the assumption that they would. be routed in air above the tank

insulation and that their operating temperature would not exceed 200°F;

however, in the actual installation, the cables were covered with insula-

tion. ‘and . the temperature at the point -of attachment to the ‘probe was prob-

sbly in. excess of 800°F. Repairs were accomplished by replacing the copper-

‘clad, mineral-insulated copper wire excitation and - signal cables and por-

"tions of the probe head assembly with a stainless-sheathed, ceramic-beaded

nickel-wire cable assembly. In the summer of 1968, one of the probes in
fuel drain tank No. 1 failed. The failure was found to be an open lead
wire inside ‘the cell. The probe wes restored to service by a cross con-
nection: outside the cell to the equivalent lead of the other probe. |

the instrumentation startup check list, one of the two high-level switches
was ‘found to be defective. Loss of this switch caused the loss of one chan-
nel of information needed to establish that the water level in the tank was
correct. | Since a second switch failure might require that the reactor be
shut down until the switches could be repaired, and since the removal - of
the’ switches from the tank is a difficult operation, a bubbler-type level

: measuring system, which included a containment block valve and associated
safety circuits in the purge supply, was designed and was installed in the
reactor-cell vapor suppression tank. This installation utilized a dip tube
which was included in the original design in anticipation of such need.
This new level system also enabled the operator to check the water level

in the tanks as a routine procedure.

24,16 - Performance of the Drain Tank Weighing Systems

The seme type pneumatic weighing devices were used on the fuel drain
tanks and the coolant drain tank. The coolant drain tank weight indicators
~ proved to be ‘stable, showing no long-term drifts or effects of external
variables. With 5756 1b of salt in the tank at about 1200°F, the extreme

spread of ko indicated weights over a period of a week was + 22 1b, This
was only. + 0. L% and was quite satisfactory.

The indicated weights of the three tanks in the fuel system exhibited
rather large unexplained changes. In some cases these amounted to 200 to
300 pounds. The mechanism causing this was not definitely established, but
probably was due to ‘changes in forces on the syspended tanks as tempera-
tures of attached piping and the tank furnaces changed. Reactor cell pres-
sure seemed to also affect the readings. The weighing systems were useful
in observing transfers of salt and for filling and draining the reactor.

In addition to this calibration drift, difficulty was experienced. with

~~ the multiposition pneumatic selector switches. Manometer readout was ac-

 

“complished by selecting a particular weigh cell channel ‘with pneumatic se-
lector valves. The valves were composed of a stacked array of individual
valves operated by cams on the operating handle shaft. Leaks ‘in these

valves gave false weight indications. A redesign of the switching device

solved this problem,

 
 

 

410

Prior to power operation, one of the weigh cells failed and was re—
placed. The failure was determined to be due to pitting of the baffle and
nozzle in the cell, This pitting was apparently caused by amalgamation of

mercury with the plating on the baffle and nozzle. How the mercury got in-
to the weigh cells has not been determined; ‘however, it was believed to
have come from the manometers and to héve been precipitated on the baffle
by expansion cooling of the air leaving the nozzle. Apprecisble quantities
of mercury were also found in the tare pressure regulators on the control
panels however, no mercury was found in the interconnecting tubing or in

other portions. of the system.

'2L,17 Performance of the Coolant Salt Flowmeters

Several days after the start of coolant salt circulation, the output
of one of the two salt flowmeter channels started drifting down scale. The
output of the other chgnnel remained steady. The trouble was isolated to
8 zero shift and possibly a span shift in the NeK-filled differential pres-
sure transmitter in the drifting channel. Since the exact cause ,could not
be determined, e spare dp cell was installed. Both channels functioned
satisfactorily throughout the remainder of the reactor operations. Tests
on the defective unit were inconclusive, however, it was determined that
the shifts were temperature-induced zero shifts possibly caused by incom-
plete filling or a lesk in the: silicone oil portion of ‘the instrument,

An operational inconvenience persisted throughout’ operations. When-
ever the radistor air flow was increased, air: leaking through the insula-
tion around the salt legs to the dp cells caused the temperature to decrease
rapidly. This necessitated adjustment of the heaters.

Due to the discrepancy between the reactor power level indicated by
fuel burnup, heat balance, etc., it is planned to recalibrate the dp cells
during the next fiscal year.

24,18 Performance of Relays

The difficulties encountered with the control rod relays are described
in Section 24.5. Experience with other relays is given below.

After sbout 2 years of operation, the 48-V-dc-operated relays showed
considerable heat damage to their bekelite frames. The manufacturer,
General Electric, advised that overheating of this particular model was
a common problem if the relays were continuously energized. Early in 1967,
twenty of the 139 relays were replaced with a later improved model. Within
a few months some of these also showed signs of deterioration. Therefore
in June 1967, all 139 relays were field-modified by replacing the built-in
resistors with externally mounted resistors. - No trouble was experienced
after this modification. :

In September 1969, the load-scram circuit, which drops the radiator
doors and stops the blower, tripped several times. Investigation showed
that some of the relay contacts had developed unusually high resistance
due to oxide films. Because of the way the contacts were paralleled in
the matrix, the film was not burned off each time the contact closed, as
in a normal application. These contacts were cleaned and no further 4if-

ficulty was encountered.

24,19 Training Simulation

Two "on-site" reactor kinetics simulators were developed for the pur-
pose of training the MSRE operators in nuclear startup and power operation.
The startup simulator used the control rod position signals as inputs, and
provided outputs of log count rate, period, log power, and linear power,
The reector's period interlocks, flux control system, and linear flux range
selector were also operationsl. In addition to this, the power level simu-
lator used the radiator door position and cooling air pressure drop signals
as inputs and provided readout of key system temperatures. Both simulators
were set up on genersl purpose, portable EAT TR-10 analog computers. Much

of the actual MSRE hardware, such as control rods were used rather than

simulated. Thus the operators manipulated the actual reactor controls and

became used to the instrumentation and controls system. This proved to be

a very relisble training tool.

2L4.20 Miscellaneous

The original mass spectrometer used to monitor for beryllium in the
coolant stack was replaced with an improved instrument near the start of
power operstion. Only occesionel repairs or preventative maintenance was
required since then.

Folded charts were used on some recorders. - These did not function

properly due to the low chart speeds being used.

24.21 Conclusions and Recommendations

Considering the quantity and complexity of the instrumentation, a
minimal amount -of difficulty was encountered. Since the MSRE was an ex-
perimental reactor; it was in many areas over-instrumented. This was proba-
bly due to not -knowing what informetion might be needed and not tseking
enough credit for the ebility. of the operators. This led to unnecessary
difficulties in normal operations or in running special experiments. At
the same time, there were areas where additional information would have

been beneficial.
