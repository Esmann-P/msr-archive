ABSTRACT

A fuel cycle that employs 23% denatured with 238 and mixed with thorium fertile
material is examined with respect to its proliferation-resistance characteristics and its
technical and economic feasibility. The rationale for considering the denatured 233U fuel
cycle is presented, and the impact of the denatured fuel on the performance of Light-Water
Reactors, Spectral-sShift-Controlled Reactors, Gas-~Cooled Reactors, Heavy-Water Reactors,
and Fast Breeder Reactors is discussed. The scope of the R,D&D programs to commercialize
these reactors and their associated fuel cycles is also summarized and the resource require-
ments and economics of denatured 233U cycles are compared to those of the conventional
Pu/U cycle. In addition, several nuclear power systems that employ denatured 233 fuel
and are based on the energy center concept are evaluated. Under this concept, dispersed
power reactors fueled with denatured or low-enriched uranium fuel are supported by secure
energy centers in which sensitive activities of the nuclear cycle are performed. These
activities include 2330 production by Pu-fueled "transmuters” (thermal or fast reactors)
and reprocessing. A summary chapter presents the most significant conclusions from the
study and recommends areas for future work.

1. INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND

In the mid-1940s, as the nuclear era was just beginning, a prestigious group includ-
ing Robert Oppenheimer and led by David Lilienthal, the first chairman of the U.S. Atomic
Energy Commission, was commissioned by Under Secretary of State Dean Acheson to recommend
ways that the benefits of nuclear energy could be shared with the world without the dangers
of what we now refer to as "nuclear proliferation": that is, the creation of numerous
nuclear weapons states. The report! they submitted states that "the proposed solution is
an international institution and framework of treaties and agreements for cooperative
operation of sensitive nuclear technology." At the same time, the committee proposed
several possible technological developments to help implement an international system,
including the denaturing of reactor fuels. They also suggested the restriction of the
most sensitive activities within a nuclear cycle to nuclear energy arenas.

In the subsequent years several steps have been taken toward international coopera-
tion in the political control of the potential for making nuclear weapons. In 1953 the
Atoms for Peace Program was initiated by the U.S. and in 1957 the International Atomic
Energy Adency was formed, one of its chartered responsibilities being the safeguarding of
fissile material and the reduction of the potential for the production of nuclear weapons.
In 1970 these efforts resulted in a nonproliferation treaty that was drafted by the U.S.
and the U.S.S.R. and subscribed to by 116 nations. As the dialog has continued, inevit-
ably all serious studies of the problem, including the most recent studies, have arrived
at the same conclusion as the Acheson committee: international cooperation and safeguards
with technological supports are mandatory -- or to state it another way, no purely tech-
nological fix to prevent nuclear proliferation is possible.

It was against this background and largely through the initiatives of President
Carter that an International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation Program (INFCE) was established
in the Fall of 1977 to study how proliferation-resistant nuclear fuel cycles could be
developed for world-wide nuclear generation of electrical power. At the same time a U.S.
Nonproliferation Alternative Systems Assessment Program (NASAP) was formed to carry out
intensive studies that would both provide input to INFCE and recommend technical and
institutional approaches that could be implemented with various nuclear fuel cycles
proposed for the U.S.

The principal. proliferation concern in civilian nuclear power fuel cycles is the pos-
sible diversion of fissile material to the fabrication of nuclear weapons. If obtained in
sufficient quantities, the fissile material employed in any nuclear fuel cycle can be pro-
cessed into weapons-usable material, but fuel cycles that are considered to offer the Teast
resistance to diversion are those that include weapons usable material that can be chemi-
cally separated from all the other materials in the cycle. The 2350 in the low-enriched
uranium (LEU) fuel used by currently operating Light-Water Reactors (LWRs) cannot be chemi-
cally separated because it is embedded in a matrix of 238, To extract the 2350 from the 238U

 
 

 

1-4

would require isotopic separation which is technologically difficult and for which few
facilities in the world currently exist. The uranium mixture itself could not be used for
weapons fabrication because the concentration of the fissile component is too low.

By contrast, the plutonium in the Pu/U mixed oxide fuel cycle developed for fast

breeder reactors such as the Liquid Metal Fast Breeder {LFMBR) can be chemically separated

from the other materials in the cycle. Thus, as presently developed, the Pu/U fuel cycle

is perceived to be less proliferation resistant than the LEU cycle. This facet of the

_ FBR-Pu/U fuel cycle was obviously a major factor in the Administration's decision in

April, 1977, to defer commercialization of the LMFBR in the United States.

Another concern about plutonium centers on its presence in the "back end" of the
LEU fuel cycle. While it does not exist in the "front end" of the cycle (that is, in the
fresh fuel), plutonium is produced in the 2380 of the fuel elements during reactor opera-
tions. Thus the spent LWR elements contain fissile plutonium that is chemically extract-
able. The fuel cycle technology includes steps for reprocessing the elements to recover
and recycle the plutonium, together with other unburned fissile material in the elements,
but to date this has not been done in the U.S. and currently a moratorium on U.S. commercial
reprocessing is in effect. As a result, the spent fuel elements now being removed from
LWRs are being stored on site. Because initially they are highly radioactive due to a
fission~product buildup, the spent elements must be heavily shielded, but as their radio-
activity decays with time less shielding wiil be required.

Various nuclear "alternatives" are being proposed by the U.S. and other countries
for international consideration in 1ieu of the classical Pu/U cycle. One proposal is
that nations continue marketing LWRs and other types of thermal reactors fueled with
natural or low-enriched uranium. A moratorium on reprocessing would be adopted, and
the spent fuel would be stored in secure national or international centers such as has
recently been proposed by the United States, the security of the fuel being transported
to the centers being provided by its fission-product radioactivity. This scenario assumes
a guarantee to the nuclear-power-consuming nations of a fuel supply for the approximately

30-year economic life of their nuclear plants.

Other proposals that assume the absence of reprocessing (and thus do not include
recycle of uranium and/or plutonium) are aimed at improving the in-situ utilization of
fissile material within the framework of current light-water technology. Light-water
reactor options such as improved refueling patterns and cycle "coastdown" procedures, as
well as more extensive modifications (such as increasing the design burnup), are being
studied. Significant gains in resource utilization also appear possible with the intro-
duction of "advanced converter" designs based on Heavy-Water Reactors (HWRs), Spectral-
Shift-Controlled Reactors (SSCRs), or High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactors (HTGRs).

While these various proposals could be useful for increasing the energy generated
from the uranium resource base while recycling is disallowed, they will not provide the
"inexhaustible" supply of nuclear fuel that has been anticipated from the commercijalization
of fuel recycle and breeder reactors. To provide such a supply would require the separation
and reuse of the "artificial" fissile isotopes 23%Pu and 233, It was under the assumption
that recycle would occur, initially in LWRs, that the technology for the Pu/U mixed-oxide
fuel cycle, in which 239Py is bred from 238, was developed. However, for the reasons
stated above, the proliferation resistance of the cycle as currently developed is perceived
as being inadequate. Its proliferation resistance could be increased by deliberately
"spiking" the fresh fuel elements with radioactive contaminants or allowing them to retain
some of the fission products from the previous cycle, either of which would discourage
seizure by unauthorized groups or states. The feasibility of these and other possible
modifications to the cycle are currently under study. In addition, the employment of
full-scope safeguards, including extensive fissile monitoring procedures , is being
investigated for use with the Pu/U cycle.

Also under study are several "alternate" fuel cycles based on the use of the
artificial fissile isotope 233 which is bred in 232Th. One such cycle is the 233y/238y/2321h
cycle proposed by Feiveson and Taylor,2 and it is this cycle that is the subject of this
report. In the 23%/238Y/232Th fuel cycle the 233 is mixed with 238) which serves as a
denaturant. The fertile isotope 232Th is included to breed additional 233U. The
addition of the 238U denaturant makes the proposed fuel cycle similar to the 235U/238y
cycle currently employed in LWRs in that extracting the 233U for weapons fabrication would
require isotope separation facilities. Since 233 does not occur in nature, the cycle is
also similar to the 23%Pu/238) cycle in that reprocessing will be necessary to utilize the
bred fuel. However, as suggested by the Acheson Committee and again by Feiveson and Taylor,
reprocessing and other sensitive activities could be restricted to secure energy centers
and still allow power to be generated outside the centers.

It is the purpose of this report to assess in the light of today's knowledge the
potential of the denatured 233y fuel cycle for meeting the requirements for electrical
power growth while at the same time reducing proliferation risks. Chapter 2 examines
the rationale for utilizing the denatured fuel cycle as a reduced proliferation measure,
and Chapter 3 attempts to assess the impact of the isotopics of the cycle, especially
with respect to an implied tradeoff between chemical inseparability and isotopic
separability of the fuel components. Chapter 4 examines the neutronic performance of
various reactor types utilizing denatured 233) fuel, and Chapter 5 discusses the require-
ments and projections for implementing the cycle. Chapter 6 then evaluates various nucl-
ear power systems utilizing denatured fuel. Finally, Chapter 7 gives summations of the
safeguards considerations and reactor neutronic and symbiotic aspects and discusses the
prospects for deploying denatured reactor systems. Chapter 7 also presents the overall
conclusions and recommendations resulting from this study.

 
 

The reader will note that throughout the study the U.S. has been used as the base
case. This was necessary because the available input data -- that is, resource base
estimates, projected reactor and fuel cycle development schedules, and assumed power
growth rates -- are all of U.S. origin. However, with access to corresponding data for
an international base, the study could be scaled upward to cover an interdependent world

model.

2.0. INTRODUCTION

The primary rationale for considering the proliferation potential of the nuclear
fuel cycles associated with civilian power reactors derives from two opposing concerns:
the possibility of nuclear weapons proliferation versus a need for and the perceived
economic/resource benefits of a nuclear-based generating capacity. At the outset it should
be emphasized that a civilian nuclear power program is not the only proliferation route
available to nonnuclear weapons states. The countries that have developed nuclear explosives
to date have not relied on a civilian nuclear power program to obtain the fissile material.
Rather, they have utilized enrichment facilities, plutonium-production. reactors, and, more
recently, a research reactor, Moreover, as opposed to a deliberate (and possibly clande-
stine) weapons-development program based upon a national decision, nuclear power programs
are currently subject to international monitoring and influence in most cases. Thus while
civilian nuclear power does represent one conceivable proliferation route, if it is made
less attractive than other possible routes, proliferation concerns should not inhibit the
development of commercial nuclear power.

Proliferation concerns regarding civilian nuclear power programs center on two
intrinsic characteristics of the nuclear fuel cycle. First, nuclear reactor fuel
inherently provides a potential source of fissile material from which production of
weapons-grade material is possible. Second, certain fuel cycle components, particularly
enrichment and reprocessing facilities, exacerbate the proliferation problem since they
provide a technological capability which could be directed towards weapons development.
The term “latent proliferation" has been coined by Feiveson and Taylor! to cover these
characteristics of the nuclear fuel cycle which, although not pertaining directly to
weapons development, by their existence facilitate a possible future decision to
establish such a capability.

It should be noted that the problem of latent proliferation impacts even the "once-

~ through" low-enriched uranium (LEU) cycle currently employed in light-water reactors (LWRs)

and also the natural-uranium cycle utilized in the Canadian heavy-water systems (CANDUs).
The technology required to enrich natural uranium to LWR fuel represents a technological
capability which could be redirected from peaceful purposes. In addition, the plutonium-
containing spent fuel, albeit dilute and contaminated with highly radioactive fission

products, represents a source of potential weapons material. Thus the possibility of

proliferation exists even for the fuel cycles now in use. This has already been recog-
nized and it has been proposed!»2 that internationally controlled fuel cycle service
centers be established whose purpose would be to preclude subversion of sensitive
technology (such as enrichment technology) and to provide facilities for the assay and
secure storage of spent once-through reactor fuel.

The establishment of such fuel cycle service centers is currently receiving serious
consideration. As the costs of Us0; production increase (and as it is preceived that long-
term reliance on nuclear power is necessary), the expansion of the fuel cycle service center
to include reprocessing activities will become attractive. The expansion would allow the
235) remaining in the spent fuel to be utilized. It would also allow the artificial (that
is, "manufactured") fissile isotopes produced as a direct result of the power production
process to be recycled. Of the latter, only two possible candidate isotopes exist: 23%Pu
and 233). In considering these two isotopes, it appears that the proliferation aspects of

their possible recycle scenarios are considerably different. In fact, the rationale for the

present study is the need to determine whether 233|)-based recycle scenarios have significant
proliferation-resistant advantages compared with plutonium-based recycle scenarios.

2.1. INTERNATIONAL PLUTONIUM ECONOMY

Prior to President Carter's April 7, 1977, nuclear policy statement, the reference
recycle fuel scenario had been based on plutonium, referred to by Feiveson and Taylor! as
the "plutonium economy." In this scenario the plutonium generated in the LEU cycle would
be recycled as feed material first into thermal reactors and later into fast breeders,
these reactors then operating on mixed Pu/U oxides instead of on uranium oxide alone. As
with any recycle scenario, the plutonium-based nuclear power economy would require the
operation of spent fuel reprocessing facilities. If dispersed throughout the world, such
reprocessing technology, like uranium enrichment technology, would markedly increase the
latent proliferation potential inherent in the nuclear fuel cycle. Of course, such facili-
ties could also be restricted to the fuel cycle service centers. However, the plutonium
recycle scenario introduces a far greater concern regarding nuclear proliferation since
weapons-usable material can be produced from the fresh mixed oxide fuel through chemical
separation of the plutonium from the uranium, whereas to obtain weapons-usable material from
LEU fuel requires isotopic enrichment in 2350,

Since the fresh mixed oxide (Pu/U) fuel of the reference cycle is vulnerable to chemical
separation, not only are the fuel fabrication facilities of the cycle potential sources of
directly usable weapons material, but also the reactors themselves. While restriction of
mixed oxide fabrication facilities to safeguarded centers is both feasible and advisable,
it is unlikely that the reactors can be centralized into a few such internationally con-
trolled centers. Rather they will be dispersed outside the centers, which will necessitate
that fresh fuel containing plutonium be shipped and stockpiled on a global scale and that
it be safeguarded at all points. Thus, as pointed out by Feiveson and Taylor,! the plu-
tonium recycle scenario significantly increases the number of nuclear fuel cycle facilities
which must be safeguarded. The prospect of such widespread use of plutonium and its as-
sociated problems of security have led to an examination of possible alternative fuel cycles
aimed at reducing the proliferation risk inherent in recycle scenarios. One such alternative
fuel cycle is the denatured 233U fuel cycle which comprises the subject of this report.

2,2. THE DENATURED 233y FUEL CYCLE

In the denatured 2330 cycle, the fresh fuel would consist of a mixture of fissile 233y
diluted with 238U (the denaturant) and combined with the fertile isotope thorium. The pre-
sence of a significant quantity of 238U denaturant would preclude direct use of the fissile
material for weapons purposes even if the uranium and thorium were chemically separated. As
in the LEU cycle, an additional step, that of isotopic enrichment of the uranium, this time
to increase its 233U concentration, would be necessary to produce weapons-grade material,
and the development of an enrichment capability would require a significant decision and com-
mitment well in advance of the actual diversion of fissile material from the fresh fuel,

This is in contrast to the reference Pu/U fresh fuel for which only chemical separation would
be required. Moreover, even if such an enrichment capability were developed, it would ap-
pear that enriching clandestinely obtained natural uranium would be preferable to diverting
and enriching reactor fuel, whether it be denatured 233U or some other type, since the reactor
fuel would be more internationally "accountable."

The primary advantage of the denatured fuel cycle is the inclusion of this "isotopic
barrier" in the fuel. Whereas in the plutonium cycle no denaturant comparable to 238U exists
and the fresh fuel safeguards (that is, physical security, international monitoring, etc.)
would all be external to the fuel, the denatured 233U fuel cycle would incorporate an in-
herent safeguard advantage as a physical property of the fuel itself. Like the plutonium
cycle, the denatured fuel cycle would require the development of fuel cycle centers to
safeguard sensitive fuel cycle activities such as reprocessing (but not necessarily refabri-
cation). However, unlike the plutonium cycle, the denatured fuel cycle would not require
the extension of such stringent safeguard procedures to the reactors themselves, and they
are the most numerous component of the nuclear fuel cycle. (As noted above, LEU fuel is also
"denatured" in the sense that a low concentration of 235) is included in a 238U matrix.
Similarly, natural uranium fuel is denatured. Thus, these fuels also have the proliferation-
resistance advantages of the isotopic barrier.)

‘The concept of denatured 233U fuel as a proliferation-resistant step is addressed
principally at the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle, that is, the fresh fuel charged
to reactors. The 238U denaturant will, of course, produce plutonium under irradiation.
Thus, as in the LEU and mixed oxide cycles, the spent fuel from the denatured cycle is a
potential source of plutonium. However, also as in the LEU and mixed oxide cycles, the
plutonium generated in the spent fuel is contaminated with highly radioactive fission products.
Moreover, the quantity of plutonium generated via the denatured fuel cycle will be signif-
icantly less than that of the other two cycles. Further, the decision to use spent

reactor fuel as a source of weapons material requires a previous commitment to the develop-

ment of shielded extraction facilities. In summary, the use of a denatured fuel as a
source of weapons material implies one of two strategic decisions: the development of an

isotopic enrichment capability to process diverted fresh fuel, or the development of a, fis-
sile extraction capability (chemical or isotopic) to process diverted spent fuel. In

 
 

 

contrast, while the plutonium cycle also would require a strategic decision concerning the
spent fuel, the decision to utilize the fresh mixed oxide fuel would be easier and thus
would be more tactical in nature.

A subsidiary proliferation-related advantage of the denatured fuel cycle is the
presence of 232 (and its highly radioactive decay daughters) in the fresh fuel. The 232y,
an unavoidable byproduct in the production of 233U from 232Th, constitutes a chemically
inseparable radioactive contaminant in the fresh fuel; which would be a further deterrent
to proliferation. Similar contamination of mixed Pu/U oxide fuel has been proposed via
"spiking" the fuel with fission products or preirradiating it to produce the fission products
in situ, but both these options would involve significant perturbations to the Pu/238U fuel
cycle as opposed to the "natural" contamination of thorium-based fuels. Additionally, the
artificial spike of mixed oxide fuel would be subject to chemical elimination, albeit re-
quiring heavily shielded facilities. The natural spike of the denatured fuel (that is, the
232) decay daughters) would also be subject to chemical elimination, but the continuing
decay of the 2320 would replace the natural spike within a limited period of time.

233y also has the advantage of a higher fissile worth in thermal reactors than 239Puy,
both in terms of the energy release per atom destroyed and in terms of the conversion ratio
(see Section 4.0). Commercial thermal reactors are currently available and are projected
to enjoy a capital cost advantage over proposed fast breeder reactors. Additionally, the
technological base required for installation and operation of a thermal system is less
sophisticated than that for fast systems such as LMFBRs. Thus it appears likely that near-
term scenarios will be dominated by current and proposed thermal systems. In considering
possible replacement fissile materials for the limited 235U base, the worth of the replace-
ment fuels in the thermal systems is of some importance.

One important factor which must be considered in discussing the denatured fuel cycle
is the potential source of the required fissile material, 233U, It appears likely that
current-generation nuclear power reactors operating on the denatured cycle will require an

external source of 233U to provide makeup requirements. Moreover, even if future de-
natured reactors could be designed to be self-sufficient in terms of 233U, there would still

remain the question of the initial 233U loading. One possible source of the required 233U
is a 233Y production reactor located in the fuel cycle service center (now perhaps more
accurately termed an energy center). This system would be fueled with plutonium and would
both produce power and transmute 232Th into 233, which could then be denatured for use out-
side the secure energy center. Loosely termed a transmuter, such a reactor would be con-
strained to the energy center because of its utilization of plutonium fuel. The required
plutonium for the transmuters is envisioned as coming initially from reprocessed LEU fuel,
and later, in the more mature system, from plutonium produced in energy-center reactors or
via the 238 denaturant in dispersed reactors. Thus, in mature form a symbiotic system such
as that depicted in Fig. 2.2-1 will evolve in which the energy center transmuters produce
fuel (233U) for the dispersed reactors and consume the plutonium produced by the dispersed

‘denatured reactors or by energy-center reactors. The dispersed reactors in turn are
provided a source of 233U for initial loading and makeup requirements, as well as a means
for disposing of the non-recyclable (in the dispersed reactors) plutonium. The significant
point of such a system is that no plutonium-containing fresh fuel circulates outside the
energy center. The plutonium contained in the spent fuel 1s returned to the center for
ultimate destruction.

Fig. 2.2-1. Schematic Fuel Flow for Symbiotic System Consisting of an
Energy Center and Dispersed Reactors Operating on Denatured 233y Fuel.

One obvious concern regarding such a coupled system is the amount of power produced
by the dispersed systems relative to that produced in the energy center reactors. The
power ratio,* defined as dispersed power generated relative to centralized power, can be
viewed as a parameter characterizing the practicality of the system. While the power

"ratio depends on the characteristics of the reactors actually utilized for the various

components and is considered in detail later in this report, certain generic statements -
can be made. In a mature "safeguarded" plutonium cycle, the ratio would be zero since

all reactors would, of necessity, be located in energy centers. In the current open-ended
LEU cycles, this ratio is essentially infinite since current nuclear generating capacity
is dispersed via "naturally denatured" thermal systems. The denatured 233) cycle will fall

¢

 

*Also called "energy support ratio."

 
 

 

between these two extremes, and thus the proposed system's power ratio will be a crucial

evaluation parameter,

The symbiotic system depicted by Fig. 2.2-1 can also be characterized by the type
of reactors utilized inside and outside the center. In general, systems consisting of
thermal (converter) reactors only, systems consisting of both thermal converters and fast
breeder reactors, and systems consisting solely of fast breeder reactors can be en-
visioned.* One important characteristic of each system is the extent to which it must rely
on an external fuel supply to meet the demand for nuclear-based generating capacity. The
thermal-thermal system would be the most resource-dependent. The breeder-thermal system
could be fuel-self-sufficient for a given power level and possibly also provide for moderate
nuclear capacity growth. The breeder-breeder scenario, if economically competitive with
alternative energy sources, would permit the maximum resource-independent nuclear contribu-

tion to energy production,

While such considerations serve to categorize the symbiotic systems themselves, the
transition from the current once-through LEU cycles to the symbiotic systems is of more
immediate concern. Although all-breeder systems would be resource-independent, commercial
deployment of such systems is uncertain. The transition to the denatured cycle could be
initiated relatively soon, however, by using moderately enriched 235U/238U mixed with
thorium (sometimes referred to as the "denatured 235U fuel cycle") in existing and pro-
jected thermal systems. The addition of thorium (and the corresponding reduction of 238y
over the LEU cycle) would serve a dual purpose: the quantity of plutonium generated would
be significantly reduced, and an initial stockpile of 233% would be produced. It should
be noted that this rationale holds even if commercial fuel reprocessing is deferred for
some time. Use of denatured 2350 fuel would reduce the amount of plutonium contained in
the stored spent fuel. In addition, the spent fuel would represent a readily accessible
source of denatured 233 should the need to shift from 235U arise. However, substituting
232Th for some of the 238U in the LEU cycle would require higher fissile loadings and thus more
235) would be committed in a shorter time frame than would be necessary with the LEU cycle.

An alternative would be to utilize energy-center Pu-burning transmuters to provide the initial
source of 233y for dispersed 233U-based reactors. From these starting points, various scenarios
which employ thermal or fast energy-center reactors coupled with denatured thermal or fast

dispersed reactors can be developed,

On the basis of the above, eight general scenarios have been postulated for this study,
with two sets of constraints on Pu utilization considered: either plutonium will not be al-
lowed as a recycle fuel but recycle of denatured 233U will be permitted; or plutonium will
be allowed within secure energy centers with only denatured fuels being acceptable for use at
dispersed site reactors. The eight scenarios can be summarized as follows:

1. Nuclear power is limited to low-enriched uranium-fueled (LEU) thermal reactors operat-
‘ing on a stowaway cycle (included to allow comparisons with current policy).

2. LEU reactors with uranium recycle are operated outside secure energy centers and thermal
reactors with plutonium recycle are operated inside the centers.

deployed within the centers.

4. LEU reactors and denatured 2350 and denatured 233U reactors are operated with uranium
recycle, all in dispersed areas; no plutonium recycle is permitted.

5. Same as Scenario 4 plus thermal reactors operating on the Pu/Th cycle are permitted
within secure energy centers.

6. Same as Scenario 5 plus FBRs with Pu/U cores and thorium blankets ("1ight" transmuta-
tion reactors) are permitted within secure energy centers,

7. Same as Scenario 6 plus denatured FBRs with 233y238y cores and thorium blankets are
permitted in dispersed areas.

8. The "light" transmutation FBRs of Scenario 7 are replaced with "heavy" transmutation
reactors with Pu/Th cores and thorium blankets.

2.3. SOME INSTITUTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS OF THE DENATURED FUEL CYCLE

As stated above, the implementation of the denatured fuel cycle will entail the

creation of fuel cycle/energy centers, which will require institutional arrangements to

manage. and control such facilities. The advantages and disadvantages of such centers,
whether they be regional, multinational, or international, as well as the mechanisms re-
quired for their implementation, have been reported.3’* Although a detailed enumeration of
the conclusions of such studies are beyond the scope of this particular discussion, certain
aspects of the energy center concept as it relates to the denatured fuel cycle are relevant.

Since only a few thousand kilograms of 233 currently exist, it is clear that
production of 233U will be required prior to full-scale deployment of the denatured 233y
cycle. If the reserves of economically recoverable natural uranium are allowed to become
extremely limited before the denatured cycle is implemented, most if not all power pro-
duced at that time would be from energy-center transmuters. Such a situation is clearly
inconsistent with the principle that the number of such centers and the percentage of
total power produced in them be minimized. A gradual transition in which 235U-based

dispersed reactors are replaced with denatured 233-based dispersed reactors and their

accompanying energy-center transmuter systems is thus desirable.

The proposed denatured fuel cycle/energy center scenario also presents an additional
dimension in the formulation of the energy policies of national states - that of nuclear
interdependence. By the very nature of the proposed symbiotic relationship inherent in

 
 

2-10

the denatured cycle, a condition of mutual dependence between the dispersed reactors and the
energy-center reactors is created. Thus while nations choosing to operate only denatured
(i.e., dispersed) reactors must obtain their fuel from nations that have energy-center trans-
muters, the nations operating the transmuters will in turn rely on the nations operating
dispersed reactors for their transmuter fuel requirements (Pu). Hence, in addition to the
possible nonproliferation advantages of the denatured fuel cycle, the concept also intro-
duces a greater flexibility in national energy policies.

3.0. INTRODUCTION

T. J. Burns and L. S. Abbott
Oak Ridge National Laboratory

An assessment of the denatured 233U fuel cycle - both for meeting the requirements
for electrical power growth and for reducing the risks of nuclear weapons proliferation -
invariably must include an examination of the isotopics of the cycle. It has been

pointed out in Chapters 1 and 2 that the concept of the denatured 233U cycle is an attempt
to retain the isotopic barrier inherent in the currently used LWR low-enriched 235y (LEY)
cycle but at the same time to allow the production and recycling of new fuel. In both the
denatured and the LEU cycles the isotopic barrier is created by diluting the fissile
isotope with 238U, so that the concentration of the fissile nuclide in any uranium chemical-
ly extracted from fresh fuel would be sufficiently low that the material would not be
directly usable for weapons purposes. This is in contrast to the two reference fuel cycles,
the Pu/U cycle, and the HEU/Th cycle. In both of these cycles, weapons-usable material
could be extracted from the fresh fuel via chemical separation. Of course, as shown in
Table 3.0-1, chemically extractable fissile material is present in the spent fuel elements
of all these cycles; however, the spent elements are not considered to be particularly
vulnerable because of the high radioactivity emitted by the fission products - at least
initially.

In this assessment of denatured 233 fuel, the implications of substituting the
denatured fuel for the reference cycles of various reactors are examined. In addition to
the obvious advantage of the isotopic barrier in the fresh fuel, denatured 233U fuel has
an additional protection factor against diversion in that its fresh fuel is radioactive
to a much greater extent than any of the other fuels listed in Table 3.0-1. This
characteristic is due to the presence of the contaminant 232U, which is generated as a
byproduct of the 233U production process and which spawns a highly radioactive decay chain.
As shown in Fig. 3.0-1, 232U decays through 228Th to stable 298pb, emitting numerous gamma
rays in the process, the most prominent being a 2.6-MeV gamma ray associated with the decay
of 20871,

The radioactivity associated with the
ORNL-DWG 65-550R3  233U significantly impacts the associated fuel

a cycle.. The fabrication, shipping, and handling
«72 of the fresh denatured fuel is expected to
differ markedly from the other cycles, primarily
220, due to the fact that remote procedures will
have to be employed throughout. To design the
i. necessary facilities will require a knowledge
el9y

of the concentrations of 232U (and its daughter
products) in the fuel as a function of time.
To date, insufficient data are available on
this subject, but on the basis of some pre-

. present in the fuel and also in thorium ore,
Fig. 3.0-1. Decay of 232y, as well as the effects of exposure to the gamma

rays emitted from the fresh fuel.

In assessing the safeguard features of denatured 233U fuel, the isotopics of the cycle
must be examined from several viewpoints. While the 232U contamination will be essentially
an inherent property of the.denatured fuel cycle, the concentration of the isotopic denaturant,
238), is controllable. The presente of both isotopes affects the proliferation potential of
the denatured fuel cycle. As the 2380 concentration is increased, the difficulty of circum-
venting the intrinsic isotopic barrier is increased. However, increasing the 2380 fraction
also increases the 23%Pu concentration in the spent fuel so that an obvious trade-off of
proliferation concerns exists between the front and back ends of the denatured fuel cycle.
As pointed out in Section 3.3.1, the enrichment criteria for denatured 233U fuel are still
being formulated.

The requirement for remote operations throughout the fuel cycle will in itself
constitute a safeguard feature in that access to fissile material will be difficult at all
stages of the cycle. But this requirement will also be a complicating factor in the design
of the fuel recycling steps and operations. This subject is treated in more detail in
Chapter 5, but Section 3.3.2 of this chapter points out that the remote operation requirement
could dictate the selection of techniques, as, for example, for the fuel fabrication process.

The radioactivity of the 232U chain would also make it easier to detect diverted de-
natured fuel and would complicate both the production of weapons-grade 233U from fresh
denatured fuel and its subsequent use in an explosive device. On the other hand, as
discussed in Section 3.3.3, the radioactivity will inhibit passive, nondestructive assays
for fissile accountability.

Finally, the possible circumvention of the isotopic barrier must be addressed. In
Section 3.3.4 it is postulated that a gas centrifuge isotope separation facility is avail-
able for isotopically enriching diverted fresh denatured 233U fuel, and estimates are made
of the amounts of weapons-grade material that could be so obtained. Conclusions are then
drawn as to the relative attractiveness of denatured 2330 fuel and other fuels to would-be
diverters.

D. T. Ingersoll
Oak Ridge National Laboratory

Although it is mandatory that the concentrations of 232U at each stage of the fuel
cycle be predictable for the various reactors operating on thorium-based fuels, little
information on the subject is available at this time. This is attributable to the fact
that the interest in thorium fuel cycles is relatively recent and therefore the nuclear
data required for calculating the production of 2°2U have not been adequately developed.
Of primary importance are the (n,y) cross sections of 2%'Pa, 2%°Th, and 23**Th and the
(n,2n) cross sections of 2%3U and 2%2Th, all ‘of which are intermediate interactions that
can lead to the formation of 23%U as is illustrated by the reaction chain given in Fig.
3.1-1. These cross sections are under current evaluation' and should appear in the Version

3.1.2. High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor Fuels

Although calculations for 232y concentrations in denatured HTGR fuels are not avail-
able, it is possible to roughly infer this information from existing HTGR calculations if
the expected changes in the thorium content are known. The conventional HTGR cycle begins
with 93% 235U-enriched uranium fuel and thorium fertile material. On successive cycles,
the 233U produced in the thorium is recycled, thus reducing the required amount of 2350
makeup. The 232U content of the recycled fuel becomes appreciable after only a few genera-
tions. Table 3.1-2 gives the uranium isotopics of the recycle fuel batches at the beginning

of recycle and at equilibrium recycle, the latter showing a maximum 232y concentration
of 362 ppm in uranium. : ’ -

The values in Table 3.1-2 are a result of a standard HTGR fuel composition which:
has an average Th/233U ratio of about 20. Preliminary estimates have been made of dena-
tured HTGR fuels which assume a 20% denatured 235U, leading to a 15% denatured 233.6
Because of the added 238y fertile material, the amount of thorium is correspondingly re-
duced by about 30%, resulting in a similar reduction in the 232U production. The con-
centration of 2320 in total uranium would also be reduced by the mere presence of the
diluting 238U, so that it can be estimated that a 15% denatured 233U HTGR would contain
approximately 40 ppm 232U in uranium after equilibrium recycle. The lower 232U levels
in the HTGR are primarily due to a softening of the neutron energy spectrum compared with
that of the LWR. This results in a marked reduction in the 232Th(n,2n”) reaction rate,
which is a prime source of 232y,

3.1.3. Fast Breeder Reactor Fuels

232Y concentrations calculated by Mann and Schenter? and by Burns® for various
commercial-sized FBR fuel cycles are given in Table 3.1-3. Except for Case 2, these
values were determined from reaction-rate calculations using 42 energy groups and one-
dimensional geometry; the Case 2 results were determined from a coarse nine-group two-

dimensional depletion calculation,

It is important to note that Cases 1 and 2 represent the "transmuter" concept. All
the discharged uranium (232y, 233y, 23%, and 2350) is bred from the 232Th initially
charged and consists principally of 233y, This accounts for the high 232U/U ratio, which
will be reduced by a factor of 5 to 8 in the denatured fuel manufactured from this mate-
rial. Thus, denatured fuel generated via the fast Pu/Th transmuter is expected to have
approximately 150-750 ppm 232U in uranium.

The last two cases in Table 3.1-3 give the equilibrium 232y concentrations assum-
ing recycle of the 2330 and the associated 232y. It should be noted that these two cases
represent the extremes regarding. allowable enrichment (233U/U). For a 20% denatured fuel
in which approximately half the heavy metal is 232Th, the expected 232 equilibrium con-
centration would be ~ 1600 ppm (232U/U) for.a 3-yr cycle residence time.

3.1.4. Conclusions

The results presented in this section are, for the most part, preliminary and/or
approximate. This is largely a consequence of the uncertainties in the anticipated fuel
compositions, denaturing limits, recycle modes, etc., as well as the basic nuclear data.
Also, the results assumed zero or near-zero 230Th concentrations, which can approach signi-
ficant levels depending cn the source of the thorium stock, particularly in thermal sys-
tems. Because of the relevant cross sections, the presence of even small amounts of 230Th
can result in considerably higher 232U concentrations. It is possible to conclude, how-
ever, that 232U concentrations will be highest for 233U-producing FBRs. increase with
fuel recycle, and decrease with fissile denaturing.

3.2. RADIOLOGICAL HAZARDS. OF DENATURED FUEL ISOTOPES

H. R. Meyer and J. E. Til
Oak Ridge National Laboratory

Consideration of the denatured 233U cycle has created the need to determine the
radiological hazards associated with extensive use of 23%U as a nuclear fuel. These
hazards will be determined by the toxicity of the various isotopes present in the fuel
and in thorium ore, which in turn is influenced by the path through which the isotopes
enter the body--that is, by inhalation or ingestion. ‘In addition, the gamma rays emitted
from the denatured fuel present a potential hazard.

3.2.1. Toxicity of 2?°U and 2°2y

Only limited experimental data are available on the toxicity of high specific activ-
ity uranium isotopes such as 2%3U and 2°20. Chemical toxicity, as opposed to radiological
hazard, is the Timiting criterion for the long-lived isotopes of uranium (%35U and 23%y)
which are of primary concern in the light-water reactor uranium fuel cycle.! In order
to establish the relative radiotoxicity of denatured 2%2U fuel, it is helpful to consider
specific metabolic and dosimetric parameters of uranium and plutonium isotopes. Table
3.2-1 lists several important parameters used in radiological dose calculations. The
effective half life for 23°Pu in bone is approximately 240 times that of uranium. How-
ever, the effective energy per disintegration for 232 is about three times greater than
that for any of the plutonium isotopes. In general, ‘the time-integrated dose from
plutonium isotopes would be significantly greater than the dose from uranium isotopes
for the inhalation pathway, assuming inhalation of equal activities of each radionuclide.
Doses via the ingestion pathway, again on a per uCi basis, are much lower than those esti-

mated for the inhalation pathway.

It is currently assumed that all bone-seeking radionuclides are five times more
effective in inducing bone tumors than 22°Ra. However, the limited number of studies that
have been conducted with 23%U (ref. 2) and 232U (refs. 3-5) suggest a reduced effectiveness
in inducing bone tumors for these isotopes and may result in use of exposure limits that

are less restrictive than current limits.

The last two columns in Table 3.2-1 represent dose conversion factors (DCFs) for
uranium ‘and plutonium isotopes calculated on the basis of mass rather than activity. It
may be seen that the 2%2y "Mass DCFs" are more than four orders of magnitude greater than
those for fissionable 23%U, due largely to the high specific activity of 232U. This factor
contributes to the overriding importance of 2%2U content when considering the radiotoxicity

of denatured uranium fuels.

Figure 3.2-1 illustrates the importance of 232U content with respect to potential
toxicity of 2%3U fuel. This figure presents the estimated dose commitment to bone calcu-

conclusions can be drawn from these data. First as recycle progresses and concentrations
of 2320 become greater, the overall radiotoxicity of #3%U fuel will increase significantly.
Second, the ingrowth of 232U daughters in 2%%U fuel increases fuel radiotoxicity signifi-
cantly for a given concentration of 232y_ Although the data graphically illustrated in
Fig. 3.2-1 were not specifically calculated for denatured 2%%U fuel, the required data not
being available, the relative shape of the curves would remain the same. All else being
equal, the estimated radiotoxicity of denatured fuel would be reduced due to dilution of
233 and 2320 with 23%U, which has a low radiological hazard.

A comparison ‘of the dose commitment to bone resulting from inhalation of 1072 g

in Fig. 3.2-2. This analysis evaluates unirradiated HTGR fuel containing 1000 ppm 232y and
does not consider fission products, activation products, transplutonium radionuclides, or
environmental transport. As shown in Table 3.2-1, the inhalation pathway would be by
far the most significant for environmentally dispersed fuels. Therefore, other potential
pathways of exposure are not considered in this brief analysis.

It is noted that Fig. 3.2-2 applies to fresh fuel as a function of time after separation,
presuming it has been released to the environment. Inhalation long after release could result
from the resuspension of radioactive materials deposited on terrestrial surfaces. A dose
commitment curve for denatured 233y fuel would be expected to lie slightly below the given
curves for HTGR fuel; however, the denatured fuel would remain significantly more hazardous
from a radiological standpoint than LWR uranium fuel.

3.2.2 Toxicity of 232Th

Given the potential for radiological hazard via the mining of western U.S. thorium
deposits as a result of implementation of 232Th-based fuel cycles, current difficulties in
estimation of 232Th DCFs must also be considered here.

As is evident in Fig. 3.0-1 (see Section 3.0), both 232U and 232Th decay to 22°Th,
and then through the remainder of the decay chain to stable 2°®Pb. 232 decays to 232Th
via a single 5.3-MeV alpha emission; 232Th decays via three steps, a 4.01-MeV alpha
emission to 22%Ra, followed by serial beta decays to 228Th. The total energy released
in the convergent decay chains is obviously nearly equal.

The ICRP? lists effective energies (to bone, per disintegration) as 270 MeV for
232Th and 1200 MeV for 232U; these effective energies are critical in the determination
of dose conversion factors to be used in estimation of long-term dose commitments. The
large difference between the effective energies calculated for the two radionuclides is
based on the ICRP assumption (ref. 7} that radium atoms produced by decay in bone of a
thorium parent should be assumed to be released from bone to blood, and then redistributed
as though the radium were injected intravenously. As a result, the presence of 228Ra in
the 232Th decay chain implies, under this ICRP assumption, that 90% of the 2?°Ra created
within bone is eliminated from the body. Therefore, most of the potential dose from the
remaining chain alpha decay events is not accrued within the body, and the total effective
energy for the 232Th chain is a factor of 4.4 lower than that for 2320, as noted.

Continuation and reevaluation of the early research®’® leading to the above dis-
similarity indicated that the presumption of a major translocation of 22%Ra out of bone
was suspect (refs. 10-14), and that sufficient evidence existed to substantiate retention
of 97% of 228Ra in bone. Recalculation of effective energies for the 232Th chain on this
basis results in a value of 1681 MeV as listed in ERDA 1451 (ref. 15), a substantial increase
implying the need for more restrictive limits with respect to 23®2Th exposures. In con-
trast to this argument, the 1972 report of an ICRP Task Group of Committee 2 (ref. 16)
presents a newly developed whole-body retention function for elements including radium
which effectively relaxes 232Th exposure limits.

3.2.3 Hazards Related to Gamma-Ray Emissions

While fuel fabricated from freshly separated 2°3U emits no significant gamma radia-
tion, ingrowth of 232U daughters leads to buildup of 2°°T1 2.6-MeV gamma radiation, as
well as other gamma and x-ray emissions. As discussed elsewhere in this report, it is
anticipated that occupational gamma exposures during fuel fabrication can be minimized by
such techniques as remote handling and increased shielding.

Gamma exposure resulting from the transportation of irradiated fuel elements con-
taining 23% will not be significantly different from that due to other fuels. Shielded
casks would be used in shipment to control exposures to the public along transportation
routes. Gamma exposure from 232 daughters would be insignificant compared to exposure
from fission products in. the spent fuel.

Refabricated fuel assemblies containing 2% would require greater radiation
shielding than LWR fuel. However, this problem can be minimized by shipping fresh assem-
blies in a container similar in design to a spent fuel cask. Gamma doses to workers and
to the general public due to transport of fuel materials between facilities are therefore
expected to be easily controlled, and have been estimated to be low, perhaps one man-rem
per 1000 MW(e) reactor-plant-year.!®

The estimated -gamma hazard of environmentally dispersed 2%2U, while a significant
contributor to externally derived doses, is overshadowed as a hazard by the efficiencies
of internally deposited alpha emitters in delivering radiological doses to sensitive

tissues.

 

3.2.4. Conclusions :

Several conclusions can be made from this assessment. It appears that additional
metabolic and toxicological data, both human and animal-derived, focusing on high specific
activity uranium, would be helpful in assessing the radiological hazards associated with
denatured 23%V fuel. Specifically, data on the biological effectiveness of 232y and 233U
could modify exposure standards for these radionuclides.

In terms of relative toxicities based on the dose commitment resulting from inhala-
tion of equal masses of fuel, plutonium fuel is significantly more hazardous than HTGR
233 fuel or denatured 2%3U fuel. However, denatured 2®2U fuel would be significantly more
hazardous than LWR uranium fuel. - As the range of fuel cycle options is narrowed, more
comprehensive research should be directed at derivation of toxicity data specific to facil-
ities and fuel compositions of choice.

Research investigating potential environmental hazards resulting from deliberate
introduction (for safeguards purposes) of gamma emitters into fuels prior to refabrication
is necessary, as is a thorough investigation of the hazards related to repeated irradiation
of recycle materials, with consequent buildup of low cross-section transmutation products.

3.3. ISOTOPICS IMPACTING FUEL SAFEGUARDS CONSIDERATIONS
3.3.1. Enrichment Criteria of Denatured Fuel

C. M. Newstead
Brookhaven National Laboratory

A very important problem in the determination of the characteristics of denatured
fuel is the isotopic composition of the uranium, that is to say, the percent of 2331
present in the mixture of 2330 plus 238U, The guidelines provided by current regulations
concerning the distinction between low-enriched uranium (LEU) and high-enriched uranium
(HEU) are applicable to 235U, the limit being set at 20% 235 in 238Y, Anything above
that constitutes HEU and anything below that constitutes LEU.

LEU is considered to be unsuitable for constructing a nuclear explosive device.
The rationale for making this statement is based upon the fact that the critical mass of
20% 235U-enriched uranium is 850 kg, and in a weapon this amount of material must be
brought together sufficiently rapidly to achieve an explosive effect. Theoretically the
enrichment could be lower and still achieve prompt criticality. However, the amount of
material becomes so enormous and the difficulty of bringing it together so great that it
would be impractical to attempt to produce an explosive device with less than 20% enrich-
ment. It is clear that the distinction is somewhat of a gray area and the enrichment
could be changed a few percent, but this should be done extremely cautiously since the
235 enrichment vs. critical mass curve is rather steep and increasing the enrichment
only slightly could reduce the critical mass substantially. Also, it is necessary to
consider institutional arrangements. A number of domestic and international regulations
revolve about the 20% figure and it would be no easy matter to change all these stipula-
tions. This sets the background against which the enrichment considerations for denatured
fuel must be addressed.

The matter of arriving at a practical criterion is complicated and is currently
under study by the Special Projects Division of Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, where an
in-depth analysis of the weapons utility of fissile material (including 233U with various
enrichments) for the Non-Proliferation Alternate Systems Assessment Program (NASAP) is
being conducted in accordance with a work scope developed by the International Security
Affairs Division (ISA) and the management of the NASAP Program. Unfortunately, the results
of the LLL study are not yet available. Because of the considerable impact of enrichment
considerations on the utility of particular reactors and particular symbiotic systems, it
seems best at this point to discuss the several approaches for determining the guide-
lines for the enrichment of 233U-238) mixtures and to make a determination based on the
LLL study at a later time.
 

 

 

3.18

There are three approaches which can be employed to estimate allowable enrichment
criteria for 233y in 238) corresponding to the statutory 20% limit set for 235U in 238y,
These three criteria are: (1) critical mass, (2) infinite multiplication factor, and
(3) yield. These can be employed singularly or in combination as discussed below.

Critical Mass

As stated above, the bare-sphere critical mass of metallic 20% 235) and 80% 238U is
about 850 kg. This amount can be reduced by a factor of two to three by the use of a
neutron reflector. However, the size and weight of the combination of reflector and
fissile material will not be substantially less than that of the bare sphere, and may
even be greater. In addition, for a nuclear explosive, an assembly scheme must be added
which will increase the size and weight substantially. Concentrations of 235y, 233y, or
plutonium in mixtures with 238U such that they have bare-sphere metallic critical masses
of about 850 kg represent one possible reasonably conservative criterion for arriving at
concentrations below which the material is not usable in practical nuclear weapons. This
850 kg bare-sphere critical mass criterion can also be used for other materials which are
or might be in nuclear fuel cycles. Although this criterion provides a basis for con-
sistent safeguards requirements for 233U or 235U embedded in 2380, it leans to rather

- low limits.

Infinite Multiplication Factor

Another possible criterion is the one associated with the infinite multiplication
factor k_. For a weapon to be successful, a certain degree of supercriticality must be
attained. D. P. Smith of Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory has adopted this approach. He
takes k_ = 1.658 for 20% 23SU-enriched uranium, which implies k_ = 1.5346 for the oxide.

He then performs a search calculation on enrichment for the other systems so as to obtain
the same k value. His results are shown in Table 3.3-1. We note that for 233) the limits
are 11.65% 233U for the oxide and 11.12% 2330 for the metal.

It may also be possible to set a minimum yield for a practical nuclear explosive
device. An obvious consideration here is that in attempting to achieve supercriticality
with increasing amounts of fissile material of decreasing enrichment, a point is
reached where the yield of an equivalent mass of chemical high explosive exceeds the
nuclear explosive yield. The LLL Special Projects Division is currently investigating
the possibility of establishing such a limit.

3.3.2. Fabrication and Handling of Denatured Fuel

J. D. Jenkins R. E. Brooksbank
Oak Ridge National Laboratory

The techniques required for fabricating and handling 233U-containing fuels encount~
ered in the denatured fuel cycle differ from those employed for 2350 fuels because of the
high gamma-ray and alpha-particle activities present in the 233U fuels. Some idea of the
radiation levels that will be encountered can be deduced from recent radiation measure-
ments for a can that contains 500 g of 233U with a 232U content of 250 ppm and has been
aged 12 years since purification. The results were as follows:

 

Distance Radiation (mr/hr)
Contact 250,000
1 ft 20,000
3 ft 2,000

These radiation levels are equivalent to those that could be expected at the same distances
from 500 g of 23°U containing ~ 1250 ppm 2°20 and aged six months, which is comparable with
233y that has undergone several cycles in a fast breeder reactor. With such high activities,
complete alpha containment of the fuel will be required, and all personnel must be protected
from the fuel with thick biological shielding (several feet of concrete or the equivalent).
This, of course, necessitates remote-handling operations, which constitutes an inherent
safeguard against the diversion of the fuel while it is being fabricated and/or handled.

The requirement for remote operation is further borne out by experience gained in
two earlier programs in which 233U-containing fuels were fabricated. In these two pro-
grams, the "Kilorod" program! and the Light Water Breeder Reactor (LWBR) program,2
(233U,Th)0, pellets could be fabricated in glove boxes, but only because the 233U used
contained extremely low (<10 ppm) amounts of 232U, Even so, the time frame for fuel fab-
rication was severely restricted and extraordinary efforts were required to keep the con-
tamination level of aged 233) sufficiently low to permit continued glove box operation.
Based on experience at ORNL in the preparation of nearly two tons of 233U0, for the LWBR
program, it was determined that the handling of kilogram quantities of 233U containing
10 ppm of 232U and processed in unshielded glove boxes 25 days after purification (complete
daughter removal) to produce 233U0, powder resulted in personnel radiation exposures of
50 mr/man-week. The techniques used in preparing Kilorod and LWBR fuel would not be feasi-
ble in a large-scale fabrication plant using 233U containing the 100 to 2000 ppm 232y
expected in recycled 233y, Therefore, one must conclude that remote fabrication, behind
several feet of concrete shielding, will be required for 233y-bearing LWR and FBR fuels.

Remote operation will impact the fabrication process and the fuel form. For ex-
ample, LWR and LMFBR fuels can be manufactured either as oxide pellets or as sol-gel
_microspheres. The many powder-handling operations required in fabricating pellets with

their inherent dusting problems and the many mechanical operations required in blending powder,
pressing, sintering, and grinding pellets make remotely operating and maintaining a 233U-
bearing pellet fabrication line difficult. Alternatively, the relative ease of handling liquids
and microspheres remotely makes the sol-gel spherepac process appear more amenable to remote
operation and maintenance than powder preparation and pelletizing processes, although the process
is less fully developed.

Detailed analyses of specific flow sheets and process layouts for a particular
fuel form would be required to quantitatively determine the relative safeguards merits of
one process versus another. In general, however, batch processes where control of special
nuclear materials can be effected by item accountability are easier than continuous pro-
cesses in which the material is contained in liquid form. Thus, in our example above, an
assessment might conclude that some sacrifices must be made in material accountability in
order to achieve remote fuel fabrication.

The overriding safeguards consideration in denatured fuel fabrication however is
the remote nature of the process itself, which limits personnel access to the fissile
material. Access is not impossible, however, for two reasons. First, for material and
equipment transfer, the processing cells will be linked to other cells or to out-of-cell
mechanisms. Second, some portions of the processing equipment may be maintained by persons
who enter the cells after appropriate source shielding or source removal. Thus, some cells
may be designed for personnel access, but all access points will be controlled because of
the requirement for alpha-activity containment. Health physics radiation monitors would
provide an indication of breach of containment and of possible diversion. Because the
ingress points from the cells will be limited, portal monitors may also provide additional
safeguards assurance.

It should be noted that although kilogram quantities of material represent high-
radiation levels from the standpoint of occupational exposures, the levels of recently
purified 233y are low enough that direct handling of the material for several days would

not result in noticeable health effects.

The remote nature of the refabrication process requires highly automated machinery
for most of the fabrication. Elaborate control and monitoring instrumentation will be
required for automatic operation and process control and can provide additional data for
material accountability and material balance consistency checks. The remote nature of the
process has the potential:of substantially improving the safeguarding of the recycle fuel
during refabrication. The extent of this improvement will depend on the specific facility
design and on the degree to which the additional real-time process information can enhance
the safeguards system. |

3.3.3 Detection and Assay of Denatured Fuel

D. T. Ingersoll
Oak Ridge National Laboratory

The relatively high gamma-ray activity of 2°3U fuels, enriched or denatured, has
opposite effects on detection and assay: it increases the detectability of the fuels
but it also increases the difficulty of passive gamma assay. That this situation exists
is apparent from Fig. 3.3-2, which presents a Ge(L1)-measured gamma-ray spectrum? from a
233) sample containing 250 ppm 23%2U. All major peaks in the spectrum are from the decay
products of 2°20, which is near secular equilibrium with the products. The presence
of the 2.6-MeV gamma ray emitted by 2°°T1 provides a useful handle for the detection of
materials that contain even small quantities of 232, thus providing a basis for preventing
fuel diversion and/or for recovering diverted fuel. On the other hand, the presence of
numerous gamma rays in the spectrum eliminates the possibility of direct gamma-ray assay
of the fissile isotope. Indirect assay using the 232 gamma rays would be impractical,
since it would require a detailed knowledge of the history of the sample.

Detection systems are already available. A Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL)
report describes a doorway monitor system" that employs a 12.7- x 2.5-cm Nal(T1) detector
and has been used to measure a dose rate of about 2.5 mr/hr at a distance of 30 cm from a
20-g sample of PuD,. Approximately the same dose rate would be measured for a similar
sample of 2330 containing 100 ppm of 232U only 12 days following the separation of daugh-
ter products. The dose rate would increase by a factor of 10 after 90 days and by an
additional factor of 4 after one year.5 Also, the gamma-ray dose rate scales linearly

with 232 content and is nearly independent of the type of bulk material, i.e., 233U,
235), or 238y,

The net counting rate for the Pu0, sample (shielded with 0.635 cm of lead) was
1000 cps. The observed background was 1800 cps, resulting in a signal-to-noise ratio of
only 0.6. Similar samples of 2?32U-contaminated uranium not only would yield higher count-
ing rates, but could also yield considerably better signal-to-noise ratios if the detector
window were set to cover only the 2.6-MeV gamma ray present in the spectrum. Although
the denaturing of uranium fuels tends to dilute the 2320 content, the anticipated 232U
levels in most denatured fuels is still sufficiently high for relatively easy detection,
except immediately after complete daughter removal.

The difficulty in performing nondestructive assays (NDA) of denatured fuels relative
to highly enriched fuels is attributable to two effects: (a) the desired signal (emitted
neutrons or gamma rays, heat generation, etc.) is reduced because of the material dilu-
tion, and (b) the signal is mostly obscured by the presence of 232U, The latter problem
exists because although denaturing reduces the total concentration of 232U, the relative
proportion of 232U to fissile material remains the same. This is an especially signifi-
cant problem with passive NDA techniques. As is shown in Fig. 3.3-2, the gamma-ray
 

|

3-23

spectrum from a 232y sample containing 250 ppm of 232y is totally dominated by the 232
decay gamma rays, thus eliminating the possibility of direct gamma-ray assay. Passive
techniques employing calorimetry are also complicated since 232y decay particles can con-
tribute significantly to the heat generation in a fuel sample. It has been calculated,3,5
that for a fresh sample of 233U containing 400 ppm 2320, nearly 50% of the thermal heat
generation can be attributed to 232U decay, which increases to 75% after only one year.

It is, therefore, apparent that fissile content assay for denatured uranium fuels will
require more sophisticated active NDA techniques which must overcome the obstacles of
material dilution and 232J-activity contamination.

"3.3.4. Potential Circumvention of the Isotopic Barrier of Denaturéd Fuel

E. H, Gift and W. B. Arthur
Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant

If a large-scale denatured-uranium recycle program is fully implemented (with secure
energy centers), many types of both fresh (unirradiated) and spent fuel may be in transit
throughout the world. In order to ensure that these fuels are proliferation resistant, they
must meet the basic criterion that a sufficient quantity of fissile material cannot be
chemically extracted from seized elements for direct use in the fabrication of a nuclear
weapon. As pointed out in previous sections. .of this report, the addition of the denaturant
238) to the fissile isotope 233U will prevent the direct use of the uranium in weapons
manufacture providing the 2330 content of the uranium remains below a specified limit, which
for this study has been set at 12% (see Section 3.3.1). Thus, even if the uranium were
chemically separated from the thorium fertile material included in the elements, it could not
be used for a weapon. Similarly, if the 2350 content of uranium is kept below 20%, the
uranium would not be directly usable. For the discussion presented here, it is further
assumed that fuels containing both 2330 and 235U will meet this criterion if their weighted
average lies between these limits.

With the chemical isolation of the primary fissile isotopes thus precluded, two poten-
tial means exist for extracting fissionable .material for the denatured fuel: (1) isotopic
separation of the fresh fuel into its 233U (or 235U) and 238 components; and (2) chemical
extraction from the spent fuel of the 23%Pu bred in the 238Y denaturant or chemical extraction
of the intermediate isotope 233Pa that would subsequently decay to 233U. In this examination
of the potential circumvention of the isotopic barrier of denatured fuel both these possibili-
ties are discussed; however, the probability of the second one actually being carried out is
essentially discounted. Thus the emphasis here is on the possibility that would-be proliferators
would opt for producing weapons-grade uranium through the clandestine operation of an isotope
separation facility. For the purposes of this study it is assumed that the seized fuel is in
the form of fresh LWR elements of one of the following fuel types:

A. Approximately 3% 2350-enriched uranium (same as currently used LWR fuel). .

B. Recycle uranium from a thorium breeder blanket, denatured to «12% 233 with depleted
uranium,

C. Fifth-generation recycle of fuel type B with 233 fissile makeup from a thorium
breeder blanket.

D. First cycle of 235U-238y-Th fuel assuming no 233U is.available from an external
source. In this fuel scheme the 2350 concentration in uranium can be as high as 20%
(see above). - ’

E. First recycle of fuel type D with 93% 235 in uranium makeup. In this fueling option,
not all of the fuel in a reload batch will contain recycle uranium. Some portion of
the reload batch will contain fuel type D. This option is analogous to the "tradi-
tional® concept envisioned for plutonium recycle fuels. It allows some of the fuel

to be fabricated in nonradioactive facilities... This fueling option will be referred
to in the remainder of the text as fuel recycle Option 1.

F. Fifth-generation recycle of fuel types D and E with 93% 2350 makeup (Option 1).

G. First recycle of fuel type D, with recycle uranium in all fuel assemblies of a reload
batch, Makeup uranium is 20% and 93% 235U as needed to maintain reactivity. In this
option all fuel would probably require remote fabrication facilities. This fueling

“option will be referred to in the remainder of the text as fuel recycle Option 2.

H. Fifth recycle of fuel type G with 2350 makeup (Option 2).

The uranium compositions of these fuels are shown in Table 3.3-2. In addition to these, it
should be assumed that natural uranium is also available.

Isotopic Separation of Fresh Fuel

Selection of Separation -Facility. Of the various uranium isotope separation processes

~ which have been conceived, only the current technology processes (i.e., gaseous diffusion,

gas centrifuge, the Becker nozzle and the South African fixed wall centrifuge) and possibly
the calutron process could be considered as near-term candidates for a clandestine facility
capable of enriching divered reactor fuel. Of these, the gas centrifuge may be the preferred
technology. This conclusion is directly related to the proven advantages of the process,
which include a high separation factor per machine, low electrical power needs, and the
adaptability to small low-capacity but high-enrichment plants. Further, more national groups
(i.e., the U.S., England, Holland, Germany, Japan, Australia, and France) have operated

 
 

3-26

either large centrifuge pilot plants or small commercial-sized plants, more so than for any
other enrichment process, so it is apparent that this technology is widely understood and
applied. A brief description of the centrifuge process, as well as descriptions of other
current and future separation technologies, is given in Appendix A.

The application of centrifuge technology to a small plant capable of producing a
couple of hundred kilograms of uranium enriched to 90% 235U has not proved to be inordinately
expensive. Two examples can be provided. An article appearing in two journals??8 presents
information on a proposed Japanese centrifuge plant. This plant, which could be operational
in 1980, is designed to produce 50 MT SWU/yr in a 7000-machine facility. The total cost of
the facility was estimated by the Japanese to be $166.7 million. Simple arithmetic yields
the individual centrifuge separation capacity of 7 kg SWU/yr and a centrifuge cost of ap-
proximately $24,000 (which includes its share of all plant facilities).

An upper limit for the cost of developing a small gas centrifuge enrichment facility
can be estimated from published costs from the United States uranium gas centrifuge program.
A paper by Kiser? provides a convenient summary of the status and cumulative costs for the
U.S. program, The Component Test Facility, a plant which is expected to have a separative
capacity of 50 MT SWU/yr (see Appendix A), was operational in January of 1977. To that
date, the cumulative cost of the entire U.S. gas centrifuge program was given as about $310
million. Of this total, about $190 million was identified as development costs. The remain-
ing $120 million was identified as equipment and facility expense. Further, only about $30
million was identified as being technology investigation. Even more intriguing is that
within the initial 3-year development program (beginning in 1960 and budgeted at $6 million),
the following accomplishments were recorded.

a. The operating performance of the gas centrifuge was greatly improved.

b. Small machines were successfully cascaded in 1961 (one year after initiation of the
contract).

c. When the last of these units was shut down in 1972, some machines had run continu-
ously for about eight years.

That these centrifuges were not commercially competitive with gaseous diffusion may be ir-
relevant when they are considered as a candidate for a clandestine enrichment facility. Thus,
as stated above, of the current technologies, the centrifuge process would probably be
selected. The utilization of the developing technologies (laser, plasma, etc.) for a
clandestine enrichment facility is not currently feasible. Successful development of these
technologies by any of the numerous national research groups would make them candidates

for such a facility, however, and they would offer the decided advantages of a high separa-
tion factor, low-power requirement and modular construction.

Effect of 232 on the Enrichment Process and Product. All fuels containing 233U also
contain substantial amounts of 232U, As mentioned earlier in this report, the daughter pro-
ducts from 232y (t, = 72 yr) release highly energetic gamma rays and alpha particles that can
complicate both the enrichment process and the subsequent weapon fabrication.

wd

rr
 

3-27

As a first step in evaluating the effect of 232U on the enrichment process and the en-
riched product, consider fuel types B and C from Table 3.3-2 as feed to an enrichment plant.
For making an acceptable weapon a fissile content of 90% 233) + 235) in the product should be
satisfactory. An acceptable product flow rate from such a plant might be 100 kg U/yr.

Based on these assumptions, the product concentrations shown in Table 3.3-3 were ob-
tained from multicomponent enrichment calculational methods.,1® This table illustrates that
while a sufficiently fissile uranium is produced, at a relatively low feed rate, the product
has also concentrated the highly gamma. active (through its decay daughters) 2324 by about
a factor of 10. Greater than 99% of the 2320 in the enrichment plant feed will be present
in the product.

In the enrichment plant the 232y concentration gradient from the feed point will
drop rapidly in the stripping section. In the tails the 232U concentration will be
reduced by about a factor of 150 from the feed concentration. As a result, the gamma
radiation levels in the enrichment plant can be expected to vary by a factor of greater
than 1000 from the tails to the product.

Calculations have been made for a typical centrifuge enrichment plant to illustrate
the gamma radiation level that could be expected at equilibrium as a function of the
232 concentration.ll These results are shown in Table 3.3-4. Implicit in these estimates
is the assumption that the daughter products of 2320 are all deposited within the enrich-
ment facility, This assumption seems justified since the fluoride compound of the first
daughter product, 228Th (t, = 1.9 years), is nonvolatile. With the exception of 22%Ra
(t, = 3,6 d}, all of the other daughters have very short lives,

Experimentally, little evidence exists to determine the true fractional deposition
of 232 daughters. Current evidence is incorporated in the existing specifications for
UF feed to the gaseous diffusion plants.?’2 These specifications call for a maximum 232y

concentration of 110 parts of 2320 per billion parts of 2350 in the feed. At this concentra-
~ tion, the radiation levels would be significant in a highly enriched product {~270 mr/hr
at 1 ft and 3 mr/hr on the plant equipment).

Based on Tables 3.3-3 and 3.3-4, the maximum gamma radiation level in a plant
enriching 2330 to 90% would be about 2 r/hr at equilibrium. At this radiation level,
little decomposition of either lubrication oils or the UFg gas would occur. Some evidencell
exists to show that at this radiation level the viscosity of the lubricating oils would be
unaffected over a 20-year plant life. Thus, there should be no bearing problem. It is also
+ expected that the UFg would be fairly stable to the combined alpha and gamma radiation
levels. At the 2-r/hr level, less than one-tenth of the mean inventory of the machine would
be decomposed per year. This material would be expected to be distributed fairly uniformly
throughout the machine with perhaps slightly higher accumulation on the withdrawal scoops.
Since the individual machine inventory would be very low, this should not be a significant
'-’/ loss of material.

When removed from the plant, the UF product would be condensed and probably stored in
monel cylinders, If it is assumed that the cylinders were sized to hold 16 kg of UFg, the
gamma dose rates that could be expected from the unshielded cylinders are as shown in

The high alpha activity of uranium containing 2320 will present two problems:

1. In the UF, there will be a strong (a,n) reaction. A crude estimate of the neutron
emission from a 16-kg UF product cylinder containing 0.6 wt% 2320 is 5.7 x 107
neutrons/sec at 10 days decay, 2.5 x 108 at 30 days decay, and 8.7 x 108 at 90 days

decay.

2. The 232) will provide a strong heat source in the UF; and the metal products. A
crude estimate of the heat generation rate from pure 2320 as a function of time after
purification is: 0.03 W/g at 10 days, 0.13 W/g at 30 days, and 0.46 W/g at 90 days.

The degree to which these properties will affect weapon manufacture or delivery is

unknown.

Alternative Enrichment Arrangements to Reduce 232 Content in the Product. In con-
sidering the complications introduced to the final uranium metal product, i.e., the radia-
tion level and heat generation resulting from 232U, it is apparent that removal of the 232y
would be beneficial. Enrichment cascades can be designed to accomplish this. The most ef-
ficient arrangement would be to first design a cascade to strip 2320 from all other uranium

isotopes and then to feed the tails from
the first cascade to a second cascade where
the fissile isotopes can be enriched. This
is illustrated in Fig. 3.3-2.

Such an enrichment arrangement can be
independent of the specific enriching device.
Based on the discussion of the gas centrifuge
process in Appendix A and at the beginning
of this section, a small, low separative work
capacity machine may be within the technical
capabilities of a would-be diverter (see
Appendix A).

Although no information exists on the
separative work capacity of a Zippe machine
in a cascade, a reasonable estimate of its
separative capacity is about 0.3 kg SWU/yr
when separating 2350 from 238y,

To further specify the plant, it can be assumed that the diverter would like to:

1. Minimize the feed and waste stream flows in the first and second cascades consistent
with limiting the number of centrifuges required.

2. Achieve a significant weapons-grade product flow rate. (A flow rate of 100 kg U/yr
having a fissile content of 90% 233U + 235U was chosen.)

3. Reduce the 232U content in the metal product so that contact manufacture can be
achieved without serious radiation hazard.

Based on these assumptions and considering the fuel types listed. in Table 3.3-2,
a series of enrichment cascades, flows and selected isotopic parameters are presented
in Table 3.3-7. The basic criterion chosen for the final uranium product was that the
232 concentration was about 1 ppm 2320 in total uranium. At this level the gamma
emission rate from the final metal product is sufficiently low that most fabrication
and subsequent handling operations can be carried out in unshielded facilities using
contact methods.

The first enrichment cascade to perform the separation of 232U from the remaining
uranium will be very radioactive. But it will be only slightly more radioactive than if
only -one cascade were used and the 232Y not separated from the final product. The table
shows that a factor of two increase in 2320 product concentration will provide sufficient
decontamination without a prohibitive increase in the number of centrifuges. If much
greater (by a factor of 20) concentrations of 232U can be tolerated in the cascade, some
reduction (~20 to 30%) can be made in the necessary number of centrifuges.

Table 3,3-7 also shows a striking difference in the number of centrifuges required
to decontaminate the uranium product when the uranium makeup to the thorium cycles is 93%
235 rather than 233U from the thorium breeder blanket. This results because with the’
235) recycle fuel it is more advantageous, both in centrifuges and in annual feed require-
ments, to design the separation to throw away in the first cascade waste stream much of
the 233U-and 23%y in addition to the 232U. Thus, the fissile content in the final product
from these fuel mixtures is nearly all 235y,

As a better means of measuring the proliferation potential of the different fuel
mixtures, the data presented in Table 3,3-7 have been recast in Table 3.3-8 as a
function of three parameters: (1) the number of centrifuges needed, (2) the uranium
feed requirements to produce 100 kg/yr of 90% fissile uranium and (3) the number of

‘standard Westinghouse PWR fuel assemblies that must be diverted.

Based on these criteria, the following conclus fons can be drawn with respect to
desirability of fuels for diversion:

1. Of the fuel mixtures that may be in commerce in a thorium-based fuel cycle, 20% 235U
mixed with thorium is the most desirable both in ease of enrichment and because it
requires diversion of the fewest fuel assemblies to produce a given quantity of
highly enriched uranium,

2. Enrichment of 233U recycle fuels, without 232U removal, is an enrichment task com-
parable (with respect to the number of centrifuges) to enriching 20% 235U., The
product, however, will be highly radioactive.

3. If would-be proliferators must remove the 232U, the 235 makeup fuels are less prolifera-
tion resistant than the 2330 makeup fuels.

4, The 2350 recycle fuels with thorium and 232 removal are equivalent to 3.2 wt%
slightly enriched uranium fuels with respect to both the number of centrifuges and
the number of fuel assemblies to be diverted.

5. The 233) recycle fuels with thorium and 232U removal are equivalent to natural
uranium enrichment with respect to the number of centrifuges.

6. If 232y removal is necessary for ease of weapon manufacture and reliability of delivery,
then a diverter would probably prefer to divert either slightly enriched uranium fuel
or enrich natural uranium than to enrich either 2350 or 233U recycle fuel from thorium
cycles. This conclusion results from the fact that for each recycle fuel, the cor-
responding slightly enriched or natural uranium fuel enrichment plant requires
approximately the same number of centrifuges but has the decided advantage of a
nonradioactive facility.

Reliability of Centrifuge Enrichment Plants. As a final item, the average centrifuge
failure rate and its impact on the maintainability and production rate of a centrifuge en-
richment plant must be considered. Information on the reliability and operating life of
centrifuges is scarce. The URENCO-CENTEC organization has over the years made claims of very
long average operating life and correspondingly low failure rates. Typical examples of
these claims can be found in some of their sales brochures.!® These claim an average 10-year
operating life and a failure rate of less than 0. 5%/year. It is not clear how much periodic

maintenance {e. 9.» oil changes and bearing inspection) is required to achieve these Tow
failure rates.

If these claims are accepted as a goal of a long-term development project, then
it can be assumed that in the early part of the development somewhat higher failure
rates would occur, perhaps greater by a factor of 10. This factor might be further
Justified in a highly radioactive plant since periodic maintenance would not be practical.

The effect of centrifuge failures on the production rate in a radioactive plant
has not been determined; however, some qualitative statements can be made. All centri-
fuge plants must be designed so that failed units or groups of units can be immediately
isolated from the rest of the plant. It should also be possible, for a specific cascade
layout, an assumed failure rate, and a specified plant operating life, to provide:

statistical redundancy throughout the plant, so that as units fail a new unit is avail-
able to be started. Thus, the production rate could be maintained for the chosen time
period within the assumed statistical reliability. In order to achieve this reliability,
greater numbers of centrifuges than listed in Table 3.3-9 would be required. The exact
number would be determinable when the above parameters are specified.

Chemical Extractions from Spent Fuel

As pointed out in the introduction to this section, another possibility for obtaining
fissionable material from diverted denatured 233 fuel is through the chemical extraction
of protactinium or plutonium from spent fuel elements. 233Pa is an intermediate isotope in
the decay chain leading from 232Th to 233U that would be chemically separable from the
uranium prior to its decay. The plutonium available in the fuel elements would be that
produced in the 238U denaturant of the fuel elements.

The technical possibility of producing pure 233 via chemical extraction of 233pa
(t, = 27.4 days) from spent denatured fuel was suggested by Wymer.l* Subsequent decay of
the protactinium would produce pure 233U, While such a process is technically feasible,
certain practical constraints must be considered. It is estimatedl® that the equilibrium
cycle discharge of a denatured LWR would contain ~34 kg of 233Pa [approximately 1 kg/metric
ton of heavy metal]. However, due to its 27.4-day half-life, a 1-MT/day reprocessing cap-
ability could recover only ~23 kg of 233Pa (beginning immediately upon discharge with a
100% 233p3 efficiency).

Presumably a diverter group/nation choosing this route would have access to a re-
processing facility. Under routine operations, spent fuel elements are usually allowed
a cool-down period of at least 120 days to permit the decay of short-lived fission products,
but in order to obtain the maximum quantity of 233Pa from the denatured fuels it would be
necessary to process the fuel shortly after its discharge from the reactor. This would
involve handling materials giving off intense radiations and would probably involve an
upgrading of the reprocessing facility, especially its shielding. On the other hand, con-
ventional reprocessing plants in general already have high-performance shields and incre-
mental increases in the dose rates would not be unmangeable, especially for dedicated groups
who were not averse to receiving relatively high exposures. Other problems requiring
attention but nevertheless solvable would be associated with upgrading the system for
controlling radioactive off-gases, making allowances for some degradation of the organic
solvent due to the high radiation level, and obtaining shipping casks with provisions for
recirculation of the coolant to a radiator.

While from the above it would appear that extraction of 233Pa would be possible,
considerably more fissile material could be obtained by extracting plutonium from the spent
denatured elements. Moreover, the usual cool-down period probably could be allowed, which
would require less upgrading of the reprocessing facility. On the other hand, the amount of
plutonium obtained from the denatured elements would be considerably less (approximately a
factor of 3 less) than the amount that could be obtained by seizing and reprocessing spent LEU
elements which are already stored in numerous countries. Thus it seems unlikely that a nation/
group would choose to extract either 233Pa or Pu from seized spent denatured fuel elements.

3.3.5. Deterrence Value of 232U Contamination in Denatured Fuel

C. M. Newstead
Brookhaven National Laboratory

The preceding sections have emphasized that unless 232U is isotopically separated
from 233U, both it and its daughter products will always exist as a contaminant of the
fissile fuel. And since as 232U decays to stable 298Pb :the daughter products emit several
high-intensity gamma rays (see Fig. 3.0-1), all 233U fuel, except that which has undergone
recent purification, will be highly radioactive. While the gamma rays, and to a lesser
extent the decay alpha and beta particles and the neutrons from a,n reactions, will intro-
duce complications into the fuel cycle, they will also serve as a deterrent to the seizure
of the fuel and its subsequent use in the fabrication of a clandestine nuclear explosive.
Consider, for example, the steps that would have to be followed in producing and using such
a device:

“1. Diverting or seizing the fissile material (as reactor fuel elements or as bulk
material).

2. a. Chemically reprocessing the spent fuel to separate out the bred fissile plu-
tonium (or 233pa) or
b. Isotopically enriching the fresh fuel or bulk material to increase the 233U con-
centration in uranium sufficiently for its use in a weapon.

3. Fabricating the fissile material into a configuration suitable for an explosive
device.

4, Arming and delivering the device.

. As indicated, at Step 2 a decision must be made as to which fissile material is to be
employed, 23%u or 233U, Extracting the plutonium present in spent denatured fuel would
require a chemical separation capability analogous to that required for current LEU spent
fuel; however, the quantity of spent denatured fuel (i.e., kilograms of heavy metal) that
would have to be processed to obtain a sufficient amount of 239%y would be increased by a
factor of 2 to 3 over the amount of LEU fuel that would have to be processed. Moreover,
for some reactor systems, the quality (i.e., the fraction of the material which is fissile)
of the plutonium recovered from denatured fuel would be somewhat degraded relative to the
LEU cycle.

The selection of 233U as the weapons fissile material means, of course, that the
material being processed through all the operations listed above would be radioactive. While
both national and subnational groups would be inhibited to some degree by the radiation
field, it is clear that a national group would be more likely to have the resources and
technological base necessary to.overcome the radiation hazard via remote handling, shielding,
and various cleanup. techniques. Thus, the radiation field due to the 232) contamination
would be effective in limiting proliferation by a nation to the extent that it would com-
plicate the procedures which the nation would have to follow in employing this path and

 
 

 

 

3-36

introduce time, cost and visibility considerations, These factors would force a

trade-off between the desirability of utilizing material from the denatured fuel cycle and
obtaining fissile material by some other means, such as isotopically enriching natural
uranium or producing plutonium in a research reactor.

A subnational group, on the other hand, would not in general possess the requisite
technological capability. In addition, while a nation could, if they chose to, carry out
these processes overtly, a subnational group would have to function covertly. Thus the
radiation barrier interposed by the self-spiking effect of the 232y contaminant in the de-
natured fuel would contribute in some measure to the safegquardability of the denatured
fuel cycle insofar as the subnational threat is concerned.

The degree of protection provided by the self-spiking of denatured fuel varies accord-
ing to the radiation level. The radiation level in turn depends on both the 2320 concentra-
tion and the time elapsed after the decay daughters have been chemically separated. As
indicated in other sections of this chapter, in denatured fuel the expected concentrations
of 232 in uranium are expected to range from ~100 to 300 ppm for thermal systems up to
+1600 ppm for recycled fast reactor fuel, It should be noted that if the latter denatured
fuel (typically 10-20% 233y in 238) is processed in an enrichment facility to obtain highly
enriched (190%) uranium, the resulting material would have a 232U content that is propor-
tionally higher, in this case ~7000 to 8000 ppm maximum.

Table 3.3-9 shows the radiation levels to be expected from various concentrations
of 232y at a number of times after the uranium has been separated from other elements in
a chemical processing plant. For a 5-kg sphere of 2330 with 5000 ppm of 232 the radia-
tion level 232 days after chemical separation is 67 r per hour at 1 m. The highest
level of deterrence, of course, is provided when the radiation level is incapacitating.
Table 3.3-10 describes the effects on individuals of various total body doses of gamma
rays. Complete incapacitation requires at least 10,000 rem. Beginning at about 5000 rem
the dose is sufficient to cause death within about 48 hr, In the 1000-rem range, death
is practically certain within a week or two. A dose causing 50% of those exposed to die
within several weeks (an LD-50) is around 500 rem. Below 100 rem it is unlikely that any
side effects will appear in the short term but delayed effects may occur in the long term.
In general, the gamma-ray total dose levels required to ensure that an individual is dis-
abled within an hour or so are at least on the order of a magnitude higher than those
likely to’ cause eventuaf death. There may be individuals who are willing to accept doses
in excess of several hundred rem and thus eventually sacrifice their lives. As indicated
above, to stop persons of suicidal dedication from completing the operations would require

doses in the 10,000-rem range. Apart from the dedicated few, however, most individuals

would be deterred by the prospect of long-term effects from 100-rem levels. However, it
js also important to note that the individuals involved in the actual physical operations
may not be informed as to the presence of or the effects of the radiation field.

An additional factor relative to the deterrent effect is the time required to carry
out the necessary operations. This is illustrated by Table 3,3-11, which gives the dose
rates (in rem/hr) required to acquire each of three total doses within various times,
varying from a totally incapacitating 20,000 rem to a prudent individual's dose of 100
rem, Thus, to divert a small amount of fissile material to a portable, shielded container
might take less than 10 seconds, in which case a dose rate of 107 rem/hr would be required
to prevent completion of the transfer. Only 200 rem/hr would be required, on the other
hand, to deliver a lethal dose to someone who spends five hours close to unshielded 233y
while performing the complex operations required to fabricate components for an explosive
device. The maximum anticipated concentration of 232) as projected for denatured fuel
does not provide sufficient intensity to reach totally disabling levels. Fast-reactor
bred material (depending on time after separation and quantity as well as 232 concentra-

The fact that the level of radiation of 232U-contaminated 233U increases with time
is a major disadvantage for a 233U-based nuclear explosive device. There is a window of
10 to 20 days immediately following chemical separation when the material is comparatively
inactive due to the removal of 228Th and its daughters. Having to deliver a device less
than ten days after fabricating it would be undesirable. While the tamper would provide
some shielding, this short time schedule would complicate the situation considerably.

For a national program it is likely that the military would want a clean 233y
weapon. This could be accomplished to a large degree by separating the 232U from the
233 using gas centrifugation. However, because the masses are only 1 amu apart this
requires several thousand centrifuges to make 100 kg of clean material per year (see Sec-
tion 3.4.4). A nation possessing this isotopic separation capability would therefore prob-
ably choose to enrich natural uranium rather than to utilize denatured fuel, thus eliminat-
ing the 232y-induced complications.

In summary, for the case of national proliferation, the intense gamma-ray field as-
sociated with the 232U impurity would not provide any absolute protection. However, the
presence of 233 and its decay daughters would complicate weapons production sufficiently
so that the nation might well prefer an alternate source of fissile material. For the case
of subnational proliferation, the intense gamma-ray field is expected to be a major deter-
rent,

4.0. INTRODUCTION

L. S. Abbott, T. J. Burns, and J. C. Cleveland
Oak Ridge National Laboratory

The three preceding chapters have introduced the concept of 233U fuel and its use in
nuclear power systems that include secure (guarded) energy centers supporting dispersed power
reactors, the rationale for such systems being that they would allow for the production and
use of fissile material in a manner that would reduce weapons proliferation risks relative
to power systems that are increasingly based on plutonium-fueled reactors. Throughout the
discussion it has been assumed that the use of denatured 233U fuel in power reactors is
feasible; however, up to this point the validity of that assumption has not been addressed.
A number of calculations have been performed by various organizations to estimate the
impact that conversion to the denatured cycle (and also to other "alternate" fuel cycles)
would have on power reactors, using as models both existing reactors and reactors whose
designs have progressed to the extent that they could be deployed before or shortly after
the turn of the century. This chapter presents pertinent results from these calculations
which, together with the predictions given in Chapter 5 on the availability of the various
reactors and their associated fuel cycles, have been used to postulate specific symbiotic
nuclear power systems utilizing denatured fuel. The adequacy of such systems for meeting
projected electrical energy demands is then the subject of Chapter 6.

The impact of an alternate fuel cycle on the performance of a reactor will, of
course, be reactor specific and will largely be determined by the differences between the
neutronic properties of the fissile and fertile nuclides included in the alternate cycle

_and those included in the reactor's reference cycle. In the case of the proposed denatured

fuel, the fissile nuclide is 2330 and the primary fertile nuclide is 232Th, with fertile
238Y included as the 233U denaturant, If LWRs such as those currently providing nuclear
power in the United States were to be the reactors in which the denatured fuel is deployed,
then the performance of the reactors using the denatured fuel must be compared with their
performance using a fuel comprised of the fissile nuclide 235 and the fertile isotope
238y, And since the use of 233U assumes recycle, then the performance of the LWRs using

denatured fuel must also be compared with LWRs in which Pu is recycled. Similarly, if
FBRs were to be the reactors in which the denatured fuel is deployed, then the performance
of FBRs operating on 233U/238y or 233Y/238y/232Th and including 232Th in their blankets

must be compared with the performance of FBRs operating on Pu/238U surrounded by a 238U
blanket.

A significant point in these two examples is that they represent the two generic
types of power reactors -- thermal and fast -- and that the neutronic properties of the
fissile and fertile nuclides in a thermal-neutron environment differ from their properties
in a fast-neutron environment. Thus while one fissile material may be the optimum fuel in
a reactor operating on thermal neutrons (e.g., LWRs) it may be the least desirable fuel
for a reactor operating on fast neutrons (e.g., FBRs).

Table 4.0-1 gives some of the pertinent neutronic properties of the different fis-
sile nuclides for a specific thermal-neutron energy. In discussing these properties,* it
is necessary to distinguish between the two functions of a fissile material: the production
of energy (i.e., power) and the production of excess neutrons which when absorbed by fertile
material will produce additional fissile fuel.

destroyed = v/(1 + a).

The energy-production efficiency of a fissile material is directly related to its
neutron capture-to-fission ratio (x), the smaller the ratio the greater the fraction of
neutron-nuclide interactions that are energy-producing fissions. As indicated by Table
4.0-1, at thermal energy the value of a is significantly smaller for 233U than for the
other isotopes, and thus 233U has a greater energy-production efficiency than the other
isotopes. (The energy released per fission differs only slightly for the above isotopes.)

The neutron-production efficiency of a fissile material is determined by the number
of neutrons produced per atom of fissile material destroyed (n), the higher the number the
more the neutrons that will be available for absorption in fertile material. Table 4.0-1
shows that the n value for 233U is higher than that for any of the other nuclides, although
plutonium would at first appear to be superior since it produces more neutrons per fission

(v). The superiority of 233U results from the fact that a is lower for 2330 and n = v/(1 + a).

Thus at thermal energies 233U both yields more energy and produces more neutrons per atom
destroyed than any of the other fissile nuclides.

In the energy range of interest for fast reactors (~0.05 - 1.0 MeV), the situation
is not quite so straightforward. Here again, the a value for 233U is significantly lower
than the values for the other fissile nuclides, and, moreover, the microscopic cross sec-
tion for fission is higher (see Fig. 4.0-1). The energy release per fission of 233 is
somewhat less than that of the plutonium nuclides, but the energy release per atom of 233U
destroyed is significantly higher than for the other nuclides. Thus, from the standpoint

*Much of this discussion on the neutronic properties of nuclides is based on refs. 1 - 3.

of energy-production efficiency, 233U is clearly superior for fast systems as well as for
thermal systems. However, with the historical emphasis on fissile production in fast systems,
the overriding consideration is the neutron-production efficiency of the system, and for
neutron production 23%Pu is superior. This can be deduced from the values for n given in

Fig. 4.0-1. The n value for 23%u is much higher than that for the other nuclides, es-
pecially at the higher neutron energies, owing to the fact that 23%Pu produces more neutrons
per fission than the other isotopes; that is, it has a higher v value, and that value is es-
sentially energy-independent. As a result, more neutrons are available for absorption in
fertile materials and 23%Pu was originally chosen as the fissile fuel for fast breeder
reactors.

The fission properties of the fertile nuclides are also important since fissions in
the fertile elements increase both the energy production and the excess neutron production
and thereby reduce fuel demands. At higher energies, fertile fissions contribute signifi-
cantly, the degree of the contribution depending greatly on the nuclide being used. As
shown in Fig. 4.0-1, the fission cross section for 232Th is significantly lower (by a factor
of approximately 4) than the fission cross section of 238U. In a fast reactor, this means
that while 15 to 20% of the fissions in the system would occur in 23U, only 4 to 5% would
occur in 232Th. Thus the paired use of 233U and 232Th in a fast system would incur a double
penalty with respect to its breeding performance. It should be noted, however, that since
denatured 233Y fuel would also contain 238U (and eventually 239py), the penalty would be
somewhat mitigated as compared with a system operating on a nondenatured 233U/232Th fuel.

In a thermal system, the fast fission effect is less significant due to the smaller fraction
of neutrons above the fertile fast fission threshold.

In considering the impact of the fertile nuclides on reactor performance, it is also
necessary to compare their nuclide production chains. Figure 4.0-2 shows that the chains
are very similar in structure. The fertile species 232Th and 23%U in the thorium chain
corresponding to 238U and 24%Py in the uranium chain, while the fissile components 233U and
2354 are paired with 239Pu and 2 Pu, and finally, the parasitic nuclides 236U and 2%2py
complete the respective chains. A significant difference in the two chains Ties in the
nuclear characteristics of the intermediate nuclides 233Pa and 237Np. Because 233Pa has
a longer half-life (i.e., a smaller decay constant), intermediate-nuclide captures are more
probable in the thorium cycle. Such captures are doubly significant since they not only
utilize a neutron that could be used for breeding, but in addition eliminate a potential
fissile atom. A further consideration associated with the different intermediate nuclides
is the reactivity addition associated with their decay to fissile isotopes following reactor
shutdown. Owing to the longer half-life (and correspondingly higher equilibrium isotopic
concentration) of 233Pa, the reactivity addition following reactor shutdown is higher for
thorium-based fuels. Proper consideration of this effect is required in the design of the
reactivity control and shutdown systems. The actual effect of all these factors, of course,
depends on the neutron energy spectrum of the particular reactor type and must be addressed
on an individual reactor basis. Significant differences also exist in the fission-product
yields of 233 versus 235y, and these, too, must be addressed on an individual reactor basis.

Consideration of many of the above factors is inherent in the "mass balance" calcula-
tions presented in this chapter for the various reactors operating on alternate fuel cycles.
It is emphasized, however, that if a definite decision were made to employ a specific alternate
fuel cycle in a specific reactor, the next step would be to optimize the reactor design for
that particular cycle, as is discussed in Chapter 5. Optimization of each reactor for the

many fuels considered was beyond the scope of this study, however, and instead the design

used for each reactor was the design for that reactor's reference fuel, regardless of the
fuel cycle under consideration.

The reactors analyzed in the calculations are light-water thermal reactors; spectral-
shift-controlled thermal reactors; heavy-water thermal reactors; high-temperature gas-
cooled thermal reactors; liquid-metal fast breeder reactors; and.fast breeder reactors of

advanced or alternate designs.

Since with the exception of the Fort St. Vrain HTGR, the existing power reactors in
the United States are LWRs, initial studies of alternate fuel cycles have assumed that they
would first be implemented in LWRs.* Thus the calculations for LWRs, summarized in Sec-
tion 4.1 have considered a number of fuels, For the purposes of the present study the fuels
have been categorized according to their potential usefulness in the envisioned power system
scenarios. Those fuel types that meet the nonproliferation requirements stated earlier in
this report are classified as "dispersible" fuels that could be used in LWRs operating out-
side a secure energy center. The dispersible fuels are further divided into denatured 233y
fuels and 235(-based fuels. The remaining fuels in the power systems are then categorized as
"energy-center-constrained" fuels. Finally, a fourth category is used to identify "reference"
fuels. Reference fuels, which are not to be confused with an individual reactor's reference
fuel, are fuels that would have no apparent usefulness in the energy-center, dispersed-reactor
scenarios but are included as limiting cases against which the other fuels can be compared.
(Note: The reactor's reference fuel may or may not be appropriate for use in the reduced
proliferation risk scenarios.)

To the extent that they apply, these four categories have been used to classify all
the fuels presented here for the various reactors. Although the contributing authors have
used different notations, the fuels included are in general as follows:

Dispersible Resource-Based Fuels

A. Natural uranium fuel (containing approximately 0.7% 2350), as currently used in
CANDU heavy-water reactors. Notation: U5(NAT)/U.

B. Low-enriched 2350 fuel (containing approximately 3% 235U), as currently used in
LWRs. Notation: LEU; US(LE)/U.

C. Medium-enriched 2350 fuel (containing approximately 20% 235U) mixed with thorium
fertile material; could serve as a transition fuel prior to full-scale implementa-
tion of the denatured 233U cycle. Notation: MEU(235)/Th; DUTH(235).

Dispersible Denatured Fuel

D. Denatured 233 fuel (nominally approximately 12% 233U in U). Notation: Denatured

DUTH(233); U3(DE)/U/Th.

~ *NOTE: The results presented in this chapter do not consider the potential improvements

in the once-through LWR that are currently under study. In general, this is also true
for the resource-constrained nuclear power systems evaluated in Chapter 6; however,
Chapter 6 does include results from a few calculations for an extended exposure
(43,000-MWD/MTU) once-through LEU-LWR. The particular extended exposure design con-
sidered requires 6% less U303 over the reactor's lifetime.

Including plutonium-fueled reactors within the energy centers serves a two-fold purpose:
It provides a means for disposing of the plutonium produced in the dispersed reactors, and
it provides for an exogeneous source of 233y.

The discussion of LWRs operating on these various fuel cycles presented in Section
4.1 is followed by similar treatments of the other reactors in Sections 4.2 - 4.6. The
first, the Spectral-Shift-Controlled Reactor (SSCR), is a modified PWR whose operation on
a LEU cycle has been under study by both the United States and Belgium for more than a
decade. The primary goal of the system is to improve fuel utilization through the in-
creased production and in-situ consumption of fissile plutonium (put). The capture of neu-
trons in the 23U included in the fuel elements is increased by mixing heavy water with

the light-water moderator-coolant, thereby shifting the neutron spectrum within the core
to energies at which neutron absorption in 238y is more likely to occur. The heavy water

content in the moderator is decreased during the cycle as fuel reactivity is depleted. The
increased capture is also used as the reactor control mechanism. The SSCR is one of a class
of reactors that are increasingly being referred to as advanced converters, a term applied
to a thermal reactor whose design has been modified to increase its production of fissile
material. ~

Heavy-water-modified thermal reactors are represented here by Canada's natural-
uranium-fueled CANDUs. Like the SSCR, the CANDU has been under study in the U.S. as an
advanced converter, and scoping calculations have been performed for several fuel cycles,
including a slightly enriched 235U cycle that is considered to be the reactor's reference
cycle for implementation in the United States.

The high-temperature gas-cooled thermal reactors considered are the U.S. HTGR and
the West German Pebble Bed Reactor (PBR), the PBR differing from the HTGR in that it

utilizes spherical fuel elements rather than prismatic fuel elements and employs on-line re-
fueling. For both reactors the reference cycle [HEU{233U)/Th] includes thorium, and shifting

 
 

4-10

to the denatured cycle would consist initially in replacing the 93% 2350 in 238 with 15
to 20% 235U in 238U., The HTGR has reached the prototype stage at the Fort Vrain plant in
Colorado and a PBR-type reactor has been generating electricity in West Germany since 1967.

While the above thermal reactors show promise as power-producing advanced converters,
they will not be self-sufficient on any of the proposed alternate fuel cycles and will re-
quire an exogenous source of 2330, An early but limited quantity of 233U could be provided
by introducing thorium within the cores of 235U-fueled LWRs, but, as has already been pointed
out in this report, for the long-term, reactors dedicated to 233U production will be required.
In the envisioned scenarios those reactors primarily will be fueled with pu’. In the
calculations presented here a principal 233% production reactor is the mixed-oxide-fueled
LMFBR containing thorium in its blanket. In addition, "advanced LMFBRs" that have
blanket assemblies intermixed with fuel assemblies are examined. The possible advantages
and disadvantages of using metal- or carbide-based LMFBR fuel assemblies are also discussed.
Finally, some preliminary calculations for a helium-cooled fast breeder reactor (GCFBR) are
presented.

The consideration of fast reactors that burn one fissile material to produce another
has introduced considerable confusion in reactor terminology which, unfortunately, has not
been resolved in this report. In the past, the term fast breeder has been applied to a
fast reactor that breeds enough of its own fuel to sustain itself. Thus, the fast reactors
that burn 23%9Py to produce 233U are not "breeders" in the traditional sense. They are,
however, producing fuel at a rate in excess of consumption, which is to be contrasted with
the advanced thermal converters whose primary function is to stretch but not increase the
fuel supply. In order to distinguish the Pu-to-233U fast reactors from others, the term
transmuters was coined at ORNL. Immediately, however, the word began to be applied to
any reactor that burns one fuel and produces another. Moreover, it soon became obvious
that the words fast and breeder are used synonymously. Thus in this report and elsewhere
we find various combinations of terms, such as LMFBR transmuter and converter transmuter,
The situation becomes even more complicated when the fast reactor design uses both 23U
and 232Th in the blanket, so that in effect it takes on the characteristics of both a
transmuter and a breeder.

Finally, the reader is cautioned not to infer that only those reactors discussed in
this chapter are candidates for the eneroy-center, dispersed-reactor scenarios. In fact,
the scenarios discussed in Chapter & do not even use all these reactors and they could
easily consider other reactor types. The selection of reactors for this preliminary
assessment of the denatured 233U fuel cycle was based primarily on the availability of
data at the time the study was initiated (December, 1977).

4,1. LIGHT-WATER REACTORS

J. C. Cleveland
Oak Ridge National Laboratory

If an alternate cycle such as the denatured cycle is to have a significant early impact,
it must be implemented in LWRs already operating in the United States or soon to be operating.
The current national LWR capacity is about 48 GWe and LWRs that will provide a total capacity
of 150 to 200 GWe by 1990 are either under construction or on order. Much of the initial
analyses of the denatured 233U fuel cycle has therefore been performed for current LWR core
and fuel assembly designs under the assumption that subsequent to the required fuels development
and demonstration phase for thoria fuels these fuels could be used as reload fuels for operating
LWRs. It should be noted, however, that these current LWR designs were optimized to minimize
power costs with LEU fuels and plutonium recycle, and therefore they do not represent optimum
designs for the denatured cycle. Also excluded from this study are any improvements in reac-
tor design and operating strategies that would improve in-situ utilization of bred fuel and
reduce the nonproductive loss of neutrons in LWRs operating on the once-through cycle. Studies
to consider such improvements have recently been undertaken as part of NASAP (Nonproliferation
Alternative Systems Assessment Program).

4.1.1. Pressurized Water Reactors

Mass flow calculations for PWRs presented in this chapter were performed primarily
by Combustion Engineering, with some additional results presented from ORNL calculations.
The Combustion Engineering System go™ (PWR) design was used in all of these analyses. A
description of the core and fuel assembly design is presented in the Combustion Engineering
Standard Safety Analysis Report (CESSAR). The following cases have been analyzed:1-%

Dispersible Resource-Based Fuels
A. LEU (i.e., low enriched uranium, ~3% 235U in 2380), no recycle,
B. MEU/Th (i.e., medium-enriched uranium, 20% 2350 in 238y, mixed with 232Th),
no recycle,
C. LEU, recycle of uranium only, 235U makeup.
MEU/Th, recycle of uranium (2350 + 233y), 20% 2350 makeup.*

Dispersible Denatured Fuel

E. Denatured 233U (i.e., ~12% 2330 in 238U, mixed with 232Th), recycle of uranium,

233 makeup.

*An alternate case utilizing 93% 2350 as a fissile topping for recovered recycle uranium and
utilizing 20% 235) as fresh makeup is also discussed by Combustion Engineering.

Reference Fuel

J. HEU/Th (i.e., highly enriched uranium, 93.15 w/o 235U in 2380, mixed with 232Th),
recycle of uranium (2350 + 233U), 235U makeup.

Case A represents the current mode of LWR operation in the absence of reprocessing.
Case B involves the use of MEU/Th fuel in which the initial uranium enrichment is limited
to 20% 23507238, With reprocessing again disallowed, Case B reflects a "stowaway" option
in which the 23%U bred in the fuel and the unburned 2350 are reserved for future utilization.

Case C represents one logical extension of Case A for the cases where the recycle
of certain matericls is allowed. However, consistent with the reduced proliferation risk
ground rule, only the uranium component is recycled back into the dispersed reactors. Case D
similarly reflects the extension of Case B to the recycle scenario. In this case, the bred
plutonium is assumed to be separated from the spent fuel but is not recycled. MEU(20% 235U/U)/Th
fuel is used as makeup material and is assumed to be fabricated in separate assemblies from
the recycle material. Thus, only the assemblies containing recycle material require remote
fabrication due to the presence of 232U, (It is assumed that the presence of the 232U pre-
cludes the recovered uranium being reenriched by isotopic separation.) The recovered uranium
from both the recycle and the makeup fuel fractions are mixed together prior to the next
recycle. This addition of a relatively high quality fissile material (uranium recovered from
the makeup fuel) to the recycle fuel stream slows the decrease in the fissile content of
the recycle uranium. As in the LEU cycle, the fissile component of the recycle fuel in
this fuel cycle scheme is diluted with 238U which provides a potential safeguards advantage
over the conventional concept of plutonium recycle in LWRs with about the same U30g
utilization.

Case E is the denatured 233U fuel. It utilizes an exogenous source of 233 for both
the initial core fissile requirements and the fissile makeup requirements.

Cases F - I represent possible fissile/fertile fuel cycle systems allowable for use
in secure energy centers, Case F represents an extension of Case C in which all the fissile
material present in the spent fuel, including the plutonium, is recycled. Under equilibrium
conditions, about 1/3 of each reload fuel batch consists of mixed oxide (M02) fuel assemblies
which contain the recycled plutonium in a uranium diluent. The remaining 2/3 of each reload
consists of fresh or recycled uranium (2350) oxide fuel.

 
 

 

Case G allows one possible means for utilizing the plutonium bred in the dispersed
reactors. Plutonium discharged from LEU-LWRs is used to provide the initial core fissile
requirements as well as the fissile makeup requirements. This plutonium is blended in a
U0, diluent consisting of natural or depleted uranium. The plutonium discharged from the
U0,/Pul, reactor is continually recycled - with two years for reprocessing and refabrica-
tion - through the reactor. In the equilibrium condition, plutonium discharged from about
2.7 LEU-fueled LWRs can provide the makeup fissile Pu requirement for one UC,/Pu0; LUR.

In Case H the Pu0,/ThO, LWR also utilizes plutonium discharged from LEU-LWRs to
provide the initial core fissile requirements and the fissile makeup requirements. This
plutonium is blended in a ThO, diluent. The isotopically degraded plutonium recovered from
the Pu0,/ThO, LWR is blended with LEU-LWR discharge plutonium (of a higher fissile content)
and recycled back into the Pu0,/ThO0, LWR., Not only does this case provide a means of
eliminating the Pu bred in the dispersed reactors but, in addition, also provides for the
production of 233U that can be denatured and used to fuel dispersed reactors.

The Pu0,/ThO, LWR of Case I is similar to that in Case H in that plutonium discharged

. from LEU-LWRs is used to provide the fissile requirements. However, the isotopically degraded

plutonium recovered from the Pu0,/ThO, LWR is not recycled into an LWR but is stored for
later use in a breeder reactor.

Case J involves the use of highly enriched uranium blended with ThO, to the desired
fuel enrichment. The uranium enrichment in HEU fuels was selected as 93.15 w/o on the basis
of information in Ref. 7. Initially all fuel consists of fresh HEU/Th fuel assemblies. Once
equilibrium recycle conditions are achieved, about 35% of the fuel consists of this fresh
makeup fuel, the remaining fuel assemblies in each reload batch containing the recycled (but
not re-enriched) uranium oxide blended with fresh ThO,.

Table 4.1-1 provides a summary, obtained from the detailed mass balance information,
of initial loading, equilibrium cycle loading, equilibrium cycle discharge, and 30-year
cumulative Us0g and separative work requirements. All recycle cases involve a two-year
ex-reactor delay for reprocessing and refabrication. It is important to point out that for
cases which involve recycle of recovered fissile material back into the same LWR, in
"equilibrium" conditions the makeup requirement for a given recycle generation is greater
than the difference between the charge and discharge quantities for the previous recycle
generation because of the degradation of the isotopics. This is especially important in
Case H where, for example, the fissile content of the plutonium drops from about 71% to
about 47% over an equilibrium cycle.

Comparing Cases A and B of Table 4.1-1 indicates the penalties associated with im-
plementation of the MEU/Th cycle relative to the LEU cycle under the restriction of no re-
cycle, The MEU/Th case requires 40% more U30g and 214% more separative work than the LEU

case, Clearly the MEU/Th cycle would be prohibitive for "throwaway" options. A second signi-
ficant result from Table 4.1-1 is given by the comparison of Case D, MEU/Th with uranium recycle
and Case F, LEU with uranium and self-generated plutonium recycle. The U30g demand in each

case is the same, although the MEU/Th cycle requires increased separative work. Additionally

it should be noted that in Case D the MEU/Th fuel also produces significant quantities of
plutonium, an additional fissile material stockpile which is not recycled in this case.

An additional case 1s considered in Chapter 6 in which an extended exposure (43 MWD/kg HM) LEU-PWR on a once-through cycle

requirements, Somewhat less plutonium is discharged from the reactor because of a reduced conversion ratio. }

Values provided are representative of years 19-23.
Reference fuels are considered only as limiting cases.

Differences in the nuclide concentrations of fertile isotopes from case to case result
in differences in the resonance integrals of each fertile isotope due to self-shielding effects,
thus significantly affecting the conversion of fertile material to fissile material. Table
41-2 gives the resonance integrals at core operating temperatures for various fuel combina-
tions. Although the value of the 238U resonance integral for an infinitely dilute medium
is much larger than the corresponding value for 232Th, the resonance integral for 2380 in LEU
fuel is only 25% larger than that for 232Th in HEU/Th fuel, indicating the much larger amount
of self-shielding occurring for 238 in LEU fuel. These two cases represent extreme values,

 
 

that for the LEU fuel as shown in Table 4.1-1 (Cases A and B) due to the increase in the

since in each case the one fertile isotope is not significantly diluted by the presence of
the other. For MEU(20% 2350/U)/Th fuel, the 238U density is reduced by a factor of ~6
(relative to LEU fuel), causing the 238U resonance integral to increase due to the reduced
self-shielding. The decrease in the 232Th density for the MEU/Th fuel (relative to the
HEU/Th) fuel is only a factor of ~0.8 - resulting in a much smaller increase in the 232Th
resonance integral. Thus, although the 2380 number density is roughly six times less in
MEU/Th fuel than in LEU fuel, the fissile Pu production in the MEU/Th fuel is still 40% of

238 resonance integral.

The presence in denatured uranium-thorium fuels of two fertile isotopes having
resonances at different energy levels has a significant effect on the initial loading
requirement, The initial 2330 requirement for the HEU/Th and MEU/Th cases is 2375 and
2538 kg/GWe, respectively, reflecting the penalty associated with the presence of the two
fertile isotopes in the MEU/Th fuel.

The large increase in initial 235J requirements shown in Table 4.1-1 for the thorium-
based HEU/Th and MEU/Th fuels compared to the LEU fuel results primarily from the larger
thermal-absorption cross section of 232Th relative to 2380 as shown in Table 4.1-2. Also
contributing to the increased 235 requirements is the lower value of n of 235U which re-
sults from the harder neutron energy spectrum in thorium-based fuels.

Aor absorption from 0.625 eV to 10 MeV; oxide fuels.

A further consideration regarding MEU(233U/U)/Th fuel with uranium recycle must also
be noted. Since the fissile enrichment of the recovered uranium decreases with each genera-
tion of recycle fuel, the thorium loadings must continually decrease. {As pointed out above,
it 1s assumed that the recovered uranium is not reenriched by isotopic separation techniques.)
The initial core 232Th/238Y ratio is ~5.8 and the first reload 232Th/238U ratio is 4.4, but
by the fourth recycle generation the 232Th/238U ratio has declined to ~1.4.% An alternative
is to use HEU (93.15 w/o 2350) as a fissile topping for the recovered uranium. In this way
the recovered uranium could be reenriched to an aliowed denaturing limit prior to recycle,

thus minimizing the core 238 component and therefore minimizing the production of plutonium.

The use of HEU as a fissile topping could be achieved by first transporting uranium recovered
from the discharged fuel to a secure enrichment facility capable of producing HEU. Next, the
HEU fissile topping would be added to the recovered uranium to raise the fissile content of
the product to an allowable limit for denatured uranium. The product (denatured) would then
be returned to the fabrication plant. MEU(20% 235U)/Th would be used to supply the remainder
of the makeup requirements. Mass flows for this option in which HEU is used as a fissile
topping are reported in refs. 2 and 6. For Case D, in which the recycle fuel is not reenriched
by addition of HEU fissile topping, about 35% more plutonium is bred over 30 yr (~60% more in
equilibrium) than when the HEU is used as a fissile topping. The 30-yr cumulative U30g and
SWU requirements for the case in which HEU is used as a fissile topping are 4120 ST U30g/GWe
and 3940 x 103 SWU/GWe respectively at a 75% capacity factor and 0.20 w/o tails.?

Table 4.1-3. Isotopic Fractions of In addition to the uranium fuel cycles

Charged Discharged plutonium which occurs in a single pass (i.e.,

2e1py 0.1428 0.2207 case was considered in which the discharged

Fissile 0.7108 0.4689 is not recycled but rather is stockpiled for

Plutonium later use in breeder reactors (Case I).

 

Only limited analyses of safety parameters have been performed thus far for the al-
ternate fuel types. Combustion Engineering has reported some core physics parameters for
thorium-based (Pu0,/Th0,) and uranium-based {Pu0,/238U0,) APRs,* and the remaining discus-
sion in this section is taken from their analysis:3

In general, the safety-related core physics parameters (Table 4.1-4) of the two
burner reactors are quite similar, indicating comparable behavior to postulated accidents
and plant transients. Nevertheless, the following differences are noted. . The effective
delayed neutron fraction (Bogs) and the prompt neutron lifetime (&*) are smaller for the
thorium APR. These are the controlling parameters in the reactor's response to short-term
(vseconds) power transients. However, the most limiting accident for this type transient
is usually the rod ejection accident and since the ejected rod worth is less for the
thorium APR, the consequences of the smaller values of these kinetics parameters are
largely mitigated.

~The moderator and fuel temperature coefficients are parameters which affect the
inherent safety of the core. In the power operating range, the combined responses of
these reactivity feedback mechanisms to an increase in reactor thermal power must be a
decrease in core reactivity. Since both coefficients are negative, this requirement is
easily satisfied. The fuel temperature coefficient is about 25% more negative for the

*Al1-plutonium reactors.

 
 

 

 

 

thorium APR, while the moderator temperature coefficient is approximately 20% less nega-
tive. These differences compensate, to a large extent, such that the consequences of
accidents which-involve a core temperature transient would be comparable. For some
accidents, however, individual temperature coefficients are the controlling parameters,
and for these cases the consequences must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Control rod and soluble boron worths are strongly dependent on the thermal-neutron
diffusion length. Because of the larger thermal absorption cross section of 232Th and

the higher plutonium loadings of the thorium APR, the diffusion length and, consequently,

“the control rod and soluble boron worths are smaller. Of primary concern is the mainte-

nance of adequate shutdown margin to compensate for the reactivity defects during postu-
lated accidents, e.g., for the reactivity increase associated with moderator cooldown in
the steam-line-break accident. The analysis of individual accidents of this type would
have to be performed to fully assess the consequences of the 10% reduction in control-rod

worth at the beginning of cycle.

The overall results of the above comparison of core physics parameters indicate
~ that the consequences of postulated accidents for the thorium APR are comparable to those
of the uranium -APR. Furthermore, this comparison indicates that other than the possi-
bility of requiring additional control rods, a thorium-based plutonium burner is feasible
and major modifications to a PWR (already designed to accommodate a plutonium-fueled core)
are probably not required, although some modifications might be desirable if reactors were
specifically designed for operation with high-Th content fuels.

4.1.2. Boiling Water Reactors

Mass flow calculations for BWRs presented in this chapter were performed by
General Electric. A description of the fuel assembly designs developed by General
Electric for the utilization of thorium is presented in Ref. 8. The following cases have
been analyzed: 8°10

Dispersible Resource-Based Fuels

A. LEU, no recycle.

B.  MEU/Th, ro recycle.

B'. LEU/Th mixed lattice (LEU and ThO, rods), no recycle.

B". LEU/MEU/Th mixed lattice (LEU/Th, MEU/Th, and ThO, rods), no recycle.
D. LEU/MEU/Th mixed lattice, recycle of uranium, 235U makeup.

Dispersible Denatured Fuel
E. Denatured 233U, recycle of uranium, 233U makeup.
Energy-Center-Constrained Fuels

F. LEU, recycle of uranium and self-generated plutonium, 235U makeup,
G. Pu/238J, recycle of plutonium, plutonium makeup.
H. Pu/232Th, recycle of plutonium, plutonium makeup.

Case A represents the current mode of BWR operation. Case B involves the replacement
of the current LEU fuel with MEU/Th fuel in which the initial uranium enrichment is limited
to 20% 235U/238y, Cases B' and B" represent partial thorium loadings that could be
utilized as alternative stowaway options. In Case B' a few of the LEU pins in a
conventional LEU lattice are replaced with pure ThO, pins, while in Case B" some LEU
pins in a conventional lattice are replaced by MEU/Th pins and a few others are replaced
with the pure ThO, pins. These cases are in contrast with Case B in which a "full" thorium
loading is used (U0,/ThQ, in every pin). Case D represents the extension of Case B" to
the recycle mode; however, only the uranium recovered from the Th-bearing pins is recycled.
Cases F-H represent possible fissile/fertile combinations for use in secure energy centers.

Table 4.1-5 provides a summary of certain mass balance information for BWRs operating
on these fuel cycles. All recycle cases involve a two-year ex-reactor delay for repro-
cessing and refabrication. So

As was shown in Table 4.1-1 for PWRs, the introduction of thorium into a BWR core
inflicts a penalty with respect to the resource requirements of the reactor (compare
U30g and SWU requirements of Cases A and B). However, as pointed out above, Case B is
for a full thorium loading. In the two General Electric fuel assembly designs®
represented by Cases B' and B" a wich smaller fissile inventory penalty results from
the introduction of thorium in the core. (Similar schemes may also be feasible for
PRs.)

Case B' is a perturbation to the reference UO, BWR assembly design in that the four
U0, corner pins in each fuel assembly are replaced with four pure ThO, pins. The remaining
U0, pins are adjusted in enrichment to obtain a desirable local power distribution and to
achieve reactivity lifetime. In the once-through mode this design increases Uj0g require-
ments by only 2% relative to the reference design. This option could be extended by
removing the ThO, corner pins from the spent fuel assemblies, reassembling them into new
assemblies, and reinserting them into the reactor. This would permit the ThO, pins to
achieve increased burnups (and also increased 233y production) without reprocessing.
U30g requirements for this scheme (i.e., re-use of the Th, rods coupled with UO, stowaway)
are approximately 1.3% higher than for the reference U0, cycle.®

Case B" is a modification of Case B' in that in addition to the four ThO, corner
pins, the other peripheral pins in the assembly are composed of MEU(235)/Th. The
remainder of the pins contain LEU. In the once-through mode this design increases U30g
requirements by 12% relative to the reference BWR UO, design.

Both Case B' and Case B" would offer ‘operational benefits to the BWR since they
have a less negative dynamic void coefficient than the reference U0, design.t This is
desirable since the sensitivity to pressure transients is reduced. As shown in Table

© 4,1-E, in equilibrium conditions a BWR employing the ThO, corner pin once-through de-

sign would discharge 24 kg 233U/GHe annually while the BWR employing the peripheral ThO,
mixed lattice design would discharge 125 kg 233U/GWe annually.

Use of these options in the once-through mode not only could improve the operational
performance of the BWR but also would build up a supply of 233U, This supply would then
be available if a denatured 233U cycle (together with reprocessing) were adopted at a later
time. Furthermore, use of the mixed lattice designs could be used to acquire experience
on the performance of thorium-based fuels in BWRs, Similar schemes for the use of thorium
in the once-through mode may also be feasible in PWRs.

Although only limited scoping analysis of the safety parameters involved in the
use of alternate fuels in BWRs has been performed,® the BWR thorium fuel designs appear
to offer some advantageous trends over U0, designs relative to BWR operations and safety.
Uranium/thorium fuels have a less negative steam void reactivity coefficient than the
U0, reference design at equilibrium. This effect tends to reduce the severity of
overpressurization accidents and improve the reactor stability. The less negative void

‘reactivity coefficient for the denatured 233/Th fuel indicates that the core will have a

flatter axial power shape than the reference U0, design. This could result in an
increase in kW/ft margin and increase the maximum average planar heat generation ratio
(MAPLHGR). Alternatively, if current margins are maintained, the flatter axial power
shape could be utilized to increase the power density or to allow refueling patterns
aimed at improved fuel utilization.

4.2, SPECTRAL~-SHIFT-CONTROLLED REACTORS

N. L. Shapiro
Combustion Engineering, Inc.

The Spectral-Shift-Controlled Reactor (SSCR) is an advanced thermal converter
reactor that is based on PWR technology and offers improved resource utilization, partic-
ularly on the denatured fuel cycle. The SSCR differs from the conventional PWR in that it
is designed to minimize the number of reactions in control materials throughout the plant
life, utilizing to the extent possible captures of excess neutrons in fertile material as
a method of reactivity control. The resulting increase in the production of fissile
material serves to reduce fuel makeup requirements.

In the conventional PWR, long-term reactivity control is achieved by varying the
concentration of soluble boron in the coolant to capture the excess neutrons generated
throughout plant life. The soluble boron concentration is relatively high at beginning
of cycle, about 700 to 1500 ppm, and is gradually reduced during the operating cycle by the
introduction of pure water to compensate for the depletion of fissile inventory and the
buildup of fission products.

The SSCR consists basically of the standard PWR with the conventional soluble boron
reactivity control system replaced with spectral-shift control. Spectral-shift control is
achieved by the addition of heavy water to the reactor coolant, in a manner analogous to
the use of soluble boron in the conventional PWR. Since heavy water is a poorer moderator
of neutrons than light water, the introduction of heavy water shifts the neutron spectrum
in the reactor to higher energies and results in the preferential absorption of neutrons
in fertile materials. In contrast to the conventional PWR, where absorption in control
absorbers is unproductive, the absorption of excess neutrons in fertile material breeds
additional fissile material, increasing the conversion ratio of the system and decreasing
the annual makeup requirements. At beginning of cycle, a high (approximately 50-70 mole %)
D,0 concentration is employed in order to increase the absorption of neutrons in fertile
material sufficiently to control excess reactivity. Over the cycle, the spectrum is
thermalized by decreasing the D,0/H,0 ratio in the coolant to compensate for fissile
material depletion and fission-product buildup, until at end of cycle essentially pure
light water (approximately 2 mole % D,0) is present in the coolant.

The basic changes ‘required to implement spectral-shift control in a conventional
PWR are illustrated in a simplified and schematic form in Fig. 4.2-1. In the conventional
PWR, pure water is added and borated water is removed during the cycle to compensate for
the depletion of fissile material and buildup of fission-product poisons. The borated
water removed from the reactor is processed by the boron concentrator which separates the
discharged coolant into two streams, one containing pure unborated water and the second

containing boron at high concentrations. The latter stream is stored until the beginning
of the subsequent cycle where it is used to provide the boron necessary to hold down the
excess reactivity introduced by the loading of fresh fuel. The SSCR can consist of the
identical nuclear steam supply system as employed in a conventional poison-controlled
PWR, except that the boron concentrator is replaced with a D,0 upgrader. The function

of this upgrader is to separate heavy and light water, so that concentrated heavy water
is available for the next refueling. The upgrader consists of a series of vacuum distil-
lation columns which utilize the differences in volatility between light and heavy water
to effect the separation. Although the boron concentrator and the upgrader perform
analogous functions and operate using similar processes, the D,0 upgrader is much larger
and more sophisticated, consisting of three or four towers each about 10 ft in diameter
and 190 ft tall. Although Fig. 4.2-1 illustrates the basic changes required to implement
the shift—control concept, numerous additional changes will be required to realize spec-
tral-shift control in practice. These include modifications to minimize and recover D,0
leakage, to facilitate refueling, and to remove boron from the coolant after refueling.

Initial analyses of spectral-shift-controlled reactors were carried out in the U.S.
by M. C. Edlund in the early 1960s and an experimental verification program was performed
by Babcock & Wilcox both for LEU fuels. and for HEU/Th fuels.! Edlund's studies, which
were performed for reactors designed specifically for spectral-shift control, indicated
that the inventory and consumption of fissile material could be reduced by 25 and 50%,
respectively, relative to poison control in reactors fueled with highly enriched 2350 and
thorium oxide, and that a 25% reduction in uranium ore requirements could be realized with
spectral shift control using the LEU cycle.?

The spectral-shift-control concept has been demonstrated by the Vulcain reactor
experiment in the BR3 nuclear plant at Mol, Belgium.3 The BR3 plant after two years of
operation as a conventional PWR was modified for spectral-shift-control operation and
successfully operated with this mode of control between 1966 and 1968. The Vulcain core
operated to a core average burnup of 23,000 MWd/T (a peak burnup of around 50,000 Mid/T)
and achieved an average load factor and primary plant availability factor of 91.2 and
98.6, respectively." The leakage rate of primary water from the high-pressure reactor
system to the atmosphere was found to be negligible, about 30 kg of D,0-H,0 mixture per
year. 3 After the Vulcain experiment was completed, the BR3 was subsequently returned to
conventional PWR operation. In addition to demonstrating the technical feasibility of
spectral-shift control, the Vulcain experiment served to identify the potential engineering
problems inherent in converting existing plants to the spectral-shift mode of control.

At the time of the major development work on the SSCR concept; fuel resource con-
servation was not recognized as having the importance that it has today. Both uranium
ore and separative work were relatively inexpensive and the technology for D0 concen-
tration was not as fully developed as it is now. With the expectation that the plutonium-
fueled breeder reactor would be deployed in the not too distant future, there appeared to
be little incentive to pursue the spectral-shift-controlled reactor concept.

The decision to defer the commercial use of plutonium and the commercial plutonium-
fueled breeder reactor is, of course, the primary motivation for reevaluating advanced
converters, and the principal incentive for considering the spectral-shift-controlled
reactor is that the potential gains in resource utilization possible with the SSCR con-
cept may be obtainable with changes largely limited to ancillary components and subsystems
in existing PWR systems. The prospects of rapid acceptance and deployment of the SSCR
are also enhanced by the low risk inherent in the concept. Since the SSCR can always be
operated in the conventional poison control mode, there would be a reduced risk to station
generating capacity if the SSCR were deployed, and financial risk would be limited to the
cost of the additional equipment required to realize spectral-shift control, which is
estimated to be only a few percent of the total cost of the plant. The risk, with respect
both to capital and generating capacity, is thus much lower than for other alternate
reactor systems.

It may also prove feasible to backfit existing pressurized water reactors with
spectral-shift control. Such backfitting might possibly be performed in some completed
plants where the layout favors modifications. However, even when judged feasible, the
benefits of backfitting would have to be great to justify the cost of replacement power
during plant modification. A second and potentially more attractive alternative is the

. possibility of modifying plants still in the early stage of construction for spectral-

shift control, or of incorporating features into these plants which would allow conversion to
spectral-shift control to be easily accomplished at a later date,

In order to establish the potential gains in resource utilization which might be
realized with spectral-shift control, scoping mass balance calculations have been performed
by Combustion Engineering for SSCRs operating on both the LEU cycle and on thorium-based
cycles, including the denatured 233y cycle.5 The calculations were performed for the C-E
system go™ core and lattice design, with the intent of updating the earlier analyses re-
ported by Edlund to the reactor design and operating conditions of modern PWRs using state-
of-the-art analytic methods and cross sections. Preliminary results from this. evaluation
are presented in Table 4.2-1. Note that these results were obtained using the standard
System 80 design and operating procedures, and no attempt has been made to optimize either
the lattice design or mode of operation to fully take advantage of spectral-shift control.

For the LEU throwaway mode, Table 4.2-1 indicates a reduction of roughly 10% both
in ore requirements and in separative work requirements relative to the conventional PWR
(compare with Case A of Table 4.1-1), If uranium recycle is allowed, the SSCR also reduces

the ore demand (and separative work) for the MEU/Th case by about 20% (compare with Case D

in Table 4.1-1).

Of particular interest to this study is the reduced equilibriim cycle makeup re-
quirements for the spectral-shift reactor fueled with 233U, As indicated, the equilibrium
cycle makeup requirement is 236 ' = 233U/GWe-yr as opposed to 304 kg 233U/GWe-yr for the
conventional PWR (see Case E in Table 4.1-1), The reduced 233y requirements, coupled with
the slightly higher fissile plutonium production, would allow a given complement of energy-
center breeder reactors to provide makeup fissile material for roughly 40% more dispersed
denatured SSCRs than conventional denatured PWRs. A comparison of the Pu/Th case with
Case H in Table 4.1-1 shows that the SSCR and PWR are comparable as transmuters. These
results are, of course, preliminary and are limited to the performance of otherwise un-
modified PWR systems, A more accurate assessment of SSCR performarce, including the
performance of systems optimized for spectral-shift control, will be performed as part of

the NASAP program. ©
The preliminary studies performed to date and the demonstration of spectral-

shift control in the Vulcain core have served to demonstrate the feasibility of the
concept and to identify the resource utilization and economic incentives for this

mode of operation. Because the basic PWR NSSS* is used, the utilization of the denatured
thorium fuel cycles will pose no additional problems or R&D needs beyond those required
to implement this type of fuel in the conventional PWR. Although the general feasibility
of spectral-shift control appears relatively well established, nevertheless there are a
number of aspects of SSCR design which must be evaluated in order to fully assess the
commercial practicality of spectral-shift-controlled reactors. The more significant of
these are briefly discussed below.

1. Resource Utilization - A more accurate assessment of resource utilization is
required to more definitively establish the economic incentives for spectral-shift control
on the LEU cycle. If the concept is to be economically competitive with conventional
water reactors, the savings in U;0, and separative work for 235U-based systems must be
demonstrated to be sufficiently large to compensate for the additional capital cost of
equipment required to implement spectral-shift control. A similar assessment for
denatured 233U fuel is also required.

2. Plant Modifications - The plant modifications necessary to realize spectral-
shift control must be identified, and the cost of these modifications established, The
practicality and cost of these modifications, of course, bear directly on the economics
and commercial feasibility of the concept. Of particular concern are modifications which
may be required to limit the leakage of primary coolant (from valve stems, seals, etc.)
and the equipment required to recover unavoidable primary coolant leakage. Primary
coolant leakage is important both from the standpoint of economics, because of the high
cost of D;0, and from the standpoint of radiation hazard, because of the problem of occu-
pational exposures to tritium during routine maintenance, Other possible modifications to
current designs which result from the presence of 0,0, such as the increased fast fluence
on the reactor vessel and possible changes in pumping power, will also have to be addressed.

NSSS = Nuclear Steam Supply ‘System.

 
 

 

4-28

3. Refueling System Modifications - At the end of each operating cycle, spent fuel
must be discharged and fresh fuel inserted into the reactor (typically 1/3.of the core
loading is replaced each year), and the light water present at end of cycle must be
replaced with a D,0-H,0 mixture before the reactor can be returned to power operation.
Refueling procedures and equipment must be developed which will allow these operations to
be performed with minimum D0 inventory requirements. Minimizing the D,0 inventory is
important to the economics and commercial feasibility of the SSCR, since the cost of D,0
represents roughly 75% of the additional capital expenditures required to realize spectral-
shift control. Care must also be taken to ensure that refueling. does not increase outage
times because of the adverse effect on capacity factor and the resulting increase in. power
cost. The exposure of personnel to tritium generated in the coolant must also be mini-

mized during refueling operations.

4. D,0 Upgrader Design - Although D,0 upgraders have yet to be employed in con-
junction with spectral-shift control, similar units have operated on CANDU reactors, and
vacuum distillation columns are also utilized in heavy-water production facilities. Thus,
the technical feasibility of the D,0 upgrader can be considered as demonstrated. However,
a conceptual upgrader design optimized for the specific demands of the SSCR must be
developed so that its cost can be determined. The upgrader is probably the single most
significant and costly piece of equipment which must be added to realize spectral-shift

control.

5. Licensability and Safety - Although the spectral-shift-controlled reactor is
not expected to raise any new safety, licensing or environmental issues except the basic
issue of tritium production and containment, a number of core physics parameters are
changed sufficiently that the response to postulated accidents must be evaluated. The
most significant of these appears to be the somewhat different moderator temperature co-
efficient of reactivity, which could lead to a number of potentially more severe accidents
early in cycle when the D,0 concentration is relatively high. The D,0 dilution accident
must also be addressed; this accident is analogous to the boron dilution accident in the
poison-controlled PWR, but the response to D,0 dilution may be more rapid and hence the
accident may be potentially more severe than its counterpart in the PWR.

Finally, it should be pointed out that while the relationship of the SSCR to the
LWR gives it market advantages, it also gives it some disadvantages relative to other
alternatives. ‘Although the SSCR demand for U;0g will be less than that of the conventional
LWR, the basic properties of light water and the LWR design characteristics inherent in
the SSCR will limit its fuel utilization efficiency to lower levels than those achievable
with other alternatives such as the HWR. On the other hand, the prospect for early and
widespread deployment may mean that it could effect a more significant reduction in over-
all system U30g demand than might be achievable with other alternatives, even though the
inherent resource utilization of an individual SSCR plant may be less than that of other
systems. Employing denatured SSCRs would allow additional time to develop effective

safeguards for breeder reactors which will eventually be required. These breeders might
produce 233, which, as pointed out above, could then be denatured and used in SSCRs.

4,3, HEAVY-WATER REACTORS

Y. I. Chang
Argonne National Laboratory

Due to the low neutron absorption cross section of deuterium, reactors utilizing heavy
water as the moderator theoretically can attain higher conversion ratios than reactors using
other moderators. As a practical matter, however, differences in the neutron absorption in
the structural materials and fission products in the different reactor types make the con-
version efficiency more dependent on reactor design than on moderator type. In the study
reported here, a current-generation 1200-MWe CANDU design was chosen as the model for ex-
amining the effects of various fuel cycle options, including the denatured 233U cycle, on

heavy-water-moderated reactors.

The CANDU design differs from the LWR design primarily in three areas: its reference
fuel is natural uranium rather than enriched uranium; its coolant and moderator are separated
by a pressure tube; and its fuel management scheme employs continuous on-line refueling
rather than periodic refueling. In the development of the CANDU reactor concept, neutron
economy was stressed, trying in effect to take maximum advantage of the D,0 properties. The
on-line refueling scheme was introduced to minimize the excess reactivity requirements.
Unlike in most other reactor systems, in the natural-uranium D,0 system the payoff in re-
ducing parasitic absorption and excess reactivity requirements is direct and substantial in
the amount of burnup achievable. These same considerations also make the CANDU an efficient
converter when the natural uranium restriction is removed and/or fueling schemes based on

recycle materials are introduced.

Penalties associated with the improved neutron economy in the ratural=uraniur-
fueled CANDU include a large inventory of the moderator (the D,0 being a significant por-
tion of the plant capital cost), a large fuel mass flow through the fuel cycle and a lower
thermal efficiency. In enriched fuel cycles, with the reactivity constraint removed, the
CANDU design can be reoptimized for the prevailing economic and rescurce conditions.

The reoptimization of the current CANDU design involves tradeoffs between economic
considerations and the neutron economy (and hence the fuel utilization). For example,
the D,0 inventory can be reduced by a smaller lattice pitch, but this results in a poorer
fuel utilization. Also, the lattice pitch is constrained by the practical limitations
placed on it by the refueling machine operations.

The fuel mass flow rate (and hence the fabrication/reprocessing costs) can te re-
duced by increasing the discharge burnup, but the increased burnup also results in a poorer
fuel utilization. In addition, the burnup has an impact on the fuel irradiation perform-
ance reliability. The fuel failure rate is a strong function of the burnup history, and

a significant increase in burnup over the current design would require mechanical design
modifications.

The thermal efficiency can be improved by increasing the coolant pressure. This
would require stronger pressure tubes and thus penalize the neutron economy. The use of
enriched fueling could result in a higher power peaking factor, which would require a vre-
duced linear power rating, unless an improved fuel management scheme is developed to re-
duce the power peaking factor.

Scoping calculations have been performed to address possible design modifications
for CANDU fuel cycles other than natural uranium,!” and detailed design tradeoff and
optimization studies associated with the enriched fuel cycles in CANDUs are being carried
out by Combustion Engineering as a part of the NASAP program. In the study reported here,
in which only the relative performance of the denatured 233U cycle is addressed, the current-
generation 1200-MWe CANDU. fuel design presented in Table 4.3-1 was assumed for all except
the natural-uranium-fueled reactor. A discharge burnup of 16,000 MWD/T {which is believed
to be achievable with the current design) and the on-line refueling capability were also
assumed.

The fuel utilization characteristics for various fuel cycle options, including the
denatured 233U cycle option, were analyzed at Argonne National Laboratory5 and the results
are summarized in Table 4,3-2. Some observations are as follows:

1. Natural-Uranium Once-Through Cycle: In the reference natural uranium cycle,
the 30-yr U30g requirement is about 4,700 ST/GWe, which is approximately 20% less than
the requirement for the LWR once-through cycle. Even though the fissile plutonium
concentration in the spent fuel is low (10.27%), the total quantity of fissile plutonium
discharged annually is twice that from the LWR,

2. Slightly-Enriched-Uranium Once-through Cycle: With slightly-enriched uranium
(1% 235¢), a 16,000-MWD/T burnup can be achieved and the U30g5 consumption is reduced by
25% from the natural-uranium cycle. As shown in Fig. 4.3-1, the optimum enrichment is
in the area of 1.2%, which corresponds to a burnup of about 20,000 MWD/T.

3. Pu/U, Pu Recycle: In this option, the natural uranium fuel is "topped" with
0.3% fissile plutonium. A discharge burnup of 16,000 MWD/T can be achieved and the plu-
tonium content in the discharge is sufficient to keep the system going with only the
natural-uranium makeup. The U30g requirement is reduced to about one half of that for
the natural-uranium cycle. (Smaller plutonium toppings decrease the burnup and make the
system a net plutonium producer; larger toppings increase the burnup and make the system
a net plutonium burner, )

4. HEU/Th, U Recycle: With 93% 235U-enriched uranium startup and makeup, the
annual U304 makeup requirements at near-equilibrium are about 27 ST/GWe for the 16,000- MWD/T
burnup case. This net consumption of U;0g is only 14% of the LWR once-through cycle and
28% of the LWR thorium cycle (see Cases A and J in Table 4.1-1). However, the initial core
U30g requirement is more than double that of the CANDU slightly enriched uranium cycle.
In addition, the transition to equilibrium and the out-of-core inventory requirements, de-
pending on the recycle turn-around time, can be very significant.

\

5. Denatured U/Th, U Recycle (233U Makeup): The initial core 233) inventory require-

ment is about 1,650 kg/GWe, with an annual net requirement of about 100 kg 233U/GWe.

 

6. MEU/Th, U Recycle (2350 Makeup): The initial core requirement is about the same

 

as that for the standard thorium cycle (i.e., HEU/Th cycle); however, the equilibrium net
U30g consumption is slightly increased.

7. MEU/Th, No Recycle: This cycle option is included to indicate that recycle of
the self-generated 233U is advisable for the MEU/Th cycle. The lifetime U,04 requirement
for the once-through MEU/Th cycle is about 8,300 ST, which is a factor of 2.3 higher than
that for the once-through enriched-uranium cycle in CANDU reactors.

4.4, GAS-COOLED THERMAL REACTORS

Jd. C. Cleveland

4.4.1. High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactors

 

The High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor (HTGR) is another candidate for implementing
alternate fuel cycle options, particularly the denatured 233U cycle. Unlike other reactor
types that generally have been optimized for either LEU or mixed oxide (Pu/238Y) fuel, the
HTGR has a design based on utilization of a thorium fuel cycle, and although current-
design HTGRs may not meet potential proliferation-based fuel cycle restrictions, the refer-
ence design involves both 232Th and 233U, which are the primary materials in the denatured
fuel cycle.

In contrast to the fuel for water-cooled reactors and fast breeder reactors, the
fuel for HTGRs is not in the form of metal-clad rods but rather is composed of coated fuel
particles bonded together by a graphite matrix into a fuel stick. The coatings on the in-
dividual fuel particles provide fission-product containment. The fuel sticks are loaded
in fuel holes in hexagonal graphite fuel blocks. These blocks also contain hexagonal arrays
of coolant channels through which the helium flows. In the conventional HTGR the fuel
particles are of two types: fissile particles consisting of UC, kernels coated with layers
of pyrocarbon and silicon carbide; and fertile particles consisting of Th0, kernels coated
only with pyrocarbon. The pyrocarbon coating on the fertile particles can be burned off
while the SiC coating on the fissile particles cannot. Therefore the two particle types
can be physically separated prior to any chemical reprocessing. As indicated in Chapter 5,
hot demonstrations of the head-erd processing operations unique to this reactor fuel, the
crushing and burning of the fuel elements, the mechanical particle separation, and the
particle crushing and burning are needed to ensure that low-loss reprocessing can take
place.

An inherent feature of the HTGR which results in uranium resource conservation is
its high (~ 40%) thermal efficiency. All else being equal, this fact alone results in a
15% reduction in uranium resource requirements compared to LWRs, which achieve a 34%
thermal efficiency. This larger thermal efficiency also leads to reduced thermal

discharges that provide significant siting advantages for HTGRs, especially if many reac-
tors are to be deployed in central locations such as energy centers.

’

Other factors inherent in HTGR design that lead to improved Ui0g utilization due
to the improved neutron economy are:
1. Absorption of only ~ 1.6% of the neutrons by HGR particle ccatings, graphite
moderator, and helium coolant, compared to an absorption of ~ 5.6% of the neu-

=
 

4-37

trons in the Zircaloy cladding and the coolant of conventional PWRs (4% of all
neutron absorptions in PWRs result from hydrogen absorption).
2. Low 233pa burnout due to the low (7-8 W/cm3) power density.

The combination of low power dersity and large core heat capacity associated with
the graphite moderator and the ceramic fuel largely mitigate the consequences of HTGR loss-
of-coolant accidents. Loss of cooling does not lead to severe conditions nearly as quickly
as in conventional LWRs or FBRs since the heat capacity of the core is maintained, there-
fore allowing considerable time to initiate actions designed to provide auxiliary core cooling.

The HTGR offers a near-term potential for realization of improved U;0g utilization.
The 330-MWe Fort St. Vrain plant has been under start-up for several years with a current

licensed power level of 70% and the plant has operated at the 70% power level for limited
periods. A data collection program is providing feedback on problem areas that are becoming
apparent during this start-up period and will serve as the basis for improvements in the

——

commercial plant design.

An advantage of the HTGR steam cycle is that its commercialization could lead to
later commercialization of advanced gas-cooled systems based on the HTGR technology. These
include the HTGR gas turbine system which has a high thermal efficiency of 45 to 50% and

A11 of the above fuel cycles are for a 3360-MWt, 1344-MWe HTGR with a core power den-
sity of 7.1 W¢/cm3. Table 4.4-1 provides a summary, obtained from the detailed mass balance
information in ref. 1, of the conversion ratio, fissile requirements, fissile discharge, and
U30g and separative work requirements. Cases 1-a and 1-b involve the use of LEU fuel with
an equilibrium cycle enrichment of 7.4 w/o and 8.0 w/o, respectively. Case 1-b would be
preferred for no-recycle conditions.

In Case 2 thorium is used with 20% 235U/U (MEU/Th) for no-recycle conditions. Note
that while the initial U30g and fissile loading requirements are higher for the MEU/Th case
than for the LEU cases, due to the larger thermal absorption cross section of thorium and the
partial unshielding of the 238U resonances resulting from its reduced density, the cumulative
U3;05 requirements are slightly less for the MEU/Th case. This results from the high burnup
attainable in HTGRs and the resultant large amount of bred 233U which is burned in situ,
Other converter and advanced converter reactors (LWRs, SSCRs, and HWRs) typically require
less U30g for the LEU case than for the MEU/Th case with no recycle.

Case 3 also uses the MEU/Th feed but with recycle of 233U. The unburned 235U and
plutonium discharged in the denatured 235U particles is not recycled. The bred 233U re-
covered from the fertile particle, however, is denatured, combined with thorium, and
recycled. In the calculations for all cases involving recycle of denatured 233U, GA assumed
that an isotopic mix of 15% 233U and 85% 238 provided adequate denaturing. Due to the high
burnup and the fact that the thermal-neutron spectrum in HTGRs peaks near the 23%Pu and 2*1Pu
resonances, a large amount of the fissile plutonium bred in the denatured fuel is burned
in situ, thus resulting in the low fissile plutonium content of the fuel at discharge. Con-
siderable 238y self-shielding is obtained by the lumping of the 238 in the coated particle
kernels. Studies are currently underway at GA concerning the use of larger diameter fissile
particles, thereby lowering the 238U resonance integral and, consequently, the amount of
bred plutonium discharged."

Case 4 employs a denatured 233U feed and includes uranium recycle. It represents a
feasible successor to Case 3 once an exogenous source of 233] is available.

Case 5 involves Pu/Th fuel. Since no 238Y is present in the core, no plutonium is
bred; only 233) is bred. This reactor has greatly reduced requirements for control poison,
resulting in enhanced neutron economy. This results from the fact that this Pu/Th HTGR
essentially achieves the "Phoenix" fuel cycle effect, i.e., the decrease in 23%u content
is largely compensated for by buildup of 241Pu from 240Py capture and by buildup of 233y
from 232Th capture, resulting in a nearly constant ratio of fissile concentration to 240py
concentration. Therefore the fuel reactivity is relatively constant over a long burnup
period, reducing the need for control poison. This allows the core to be batch loaded;
i.e., the entire core is reloaded at approximately 5-yr intervals. This reload scheme
minimizes down time for refueling and eliminates problems of power sharing between fuel
elements of different ages. Furthermore, it allows easy conversion to a U/Th HTGR after
any cycle. It is important to note that the Pu/Th case presented in Table 4.4-1 is not

optimized for high conversion; rather it is a Pu burner designed for low fuel cycle costs.
A Pu/Th case designed for high 233U production would have a C/Th ratio for the equilibrium
cycle of ~430 rather than 650 as in Case 5 (ref. 5).

In Case 6 the feed is fully enriched (93%) uranium and thorium and no recycle is allowed.
Such a system would provide the means for generating a potential stockpile of 233) in the
absence of reprocessing capability. If 233U recycle is not contemplated, the economical optimum
once-through cycle would have a lower thorium loading (C/Th = 330).

Case 7 involves the use of highly enriched 233U and uranium recycle. The heavy fer-
tile loading (C/Th = 150) results in the high conversion ratio (and high initial fissile

loading requirement) shown in Table 4.4-1.

Case 8 involves the use of fully enriched (93%) uranium and thorium designed for
recycle conditions. This is included as the pre-1977 reference high-gain HEU(2350)/Th
recycle case for comparison with the other above cases.

Both GA and ORNL have performed mass balance calculations for an HEU(235U)/Th fuel
cycle with uranium recycle.2,8 These calculations were for a 1160-MWe plant with a power
density of 8.4 Wi/cm3 and a C/Th ratio for the first core and reload cycles of 214 and
238 respectively, The GA results indicate cumulative U30g and separative work requirements
(for a capacity factor of 75% and an assumed tails enrichment of 0.2 w/o) of 2783 ST U30g/
GWe and 2778 kg SWU/GWe, respectively. The corresponding results for the ORNL calculations
are 2690 ST U,045/GWe and 2684 kg SWU/GWe. As can be seen, the agreement is fairly good.
Comparison of these results with the same case without recycle (Case 6, Table 4.4-1) shows
a U30g4 savings of ~38% if uranium is recycled.

It is conventional to compare 30-yr cumulative U30g and separative work requirements
for different reactor types on a per GWe basis with an assumed constant capacity factor.
The results reported in Table 4.4-1 were generated for an assumed variable capacity factor
which averaged 65.9% over the 30-yr life. To facilitate comparison with U30g requirements
in other sections of Chapter 4, estimated 30-yr requirements for a constant capacity factor
of 75% have also been included in the table, These values were obtained by applying a
factor of 0.750/0.659 to the calculated requirements for the variable capacity factor.
Obviously this technique is an approximation but it is fairly accurate. The 30-yr require-
ments for a 75% capacity factor for Case 8 were explicitly calculated and not obtained by
the above estimating procedure.

As is indicated in Table 4.4-1, the MEU(20% 235U)/Th no-recycle case is more re-
source efficient than the LEU no-recycle case. This results from the high exposure attain-
able in HTGR fuels and the high in situ utilization of 233U. In water reactors, the once-
through MEU(20% 235U)/Th cycle requires significantly more U;0g than the once-through LEU
cycle. Thus MEU(20% 235U)/Th fuels in HTGRs are an attractive option for stowaway cycles
in which 233U is bred for later use.

4.4.2. Pebble-Bed High-Temperature Reactors

A second high-temperature gas-cooled thermal reactor that is a possible candidate
for the denatured 233U fuel cycle is the Pebble-Bed Reactor (PBR). Experience with PBRs
began in August, 1966, in Julich, West Germany, with the criticality of the Arbeitgemeinshaft
Versuch Reaktor (AVR), a 46-Mit reactor that was developed to gain knowledge and experience
in the construction and operation of a high-temperature helium-cooled reactor fueled with
spherical elements comprised of carbon-coated fuel particles. This experience was intended
to serve as a basis for further development of this concept in West Germany. Generation
of electricity with the AVR began in 1967.

In addition to generating electric power, the AVR is a test facility for investigat-
ing the behavior of spherical fuel elements. It also is a supplier of high-burnup high-
temperature reactor fuel elements for the West German fuel reprocessing development work.
The continuation of the PBR development initiated by the AVR is represented by the THTR
at Schmehausen, a reactor designed for 750 MWt with a net electrical output of 300 MW,
Startup of the THTR is expected about 1980. ’

loading in the MEU/Th fuel element is between that of the THTR and AVR elements. As in

Case 1, the radial power is flattened by the choice of fissile loading of the elements in the
inner and outer radial core zones, 6.85 and 11.4% respectively. The coated particles

would require some development and testing. Co

 

Case 3, Seed and Breed MEU/Th. (U + Th)O, fuel with 20% enriched uranium is loaded
into seed elements and ThO, is loaded into breed elements. By thus separating the seed and
breed elements, 236U bred into the seed elements will not have contaminated the 233y pro-
duced in the breed elements in case recycle is opted for later. Graphite balls are added
to the inner core zone to adjust the carbon/heavy metal ratio (C/HM) to that of the outer
zone. The heavy metal loading of 6 g HM/ball in the seed elements is essentially the
same as in the AVR. The feasibility of a considerably heavier loading of the breed ele-
ments, 16.54 g HM/ball, is currently being tested.

Case 4, HEU/Th. (U + Th)0, fuel with 93% enriched uranium is loaded into the coated
fuel particles. The coated particle and fuel element designs are essentially identical to
those of THTR fuel elements, which have been licensed and are being manufactured. The only
modification is the fissile loading. Again the fissile loading of the elements in the inner
and outer radial core zones is varied to flatten the radial power distribution, the inner zone
fissile loading being 6.23% of the heavy metal and the outer zone fissile loading being 10.9%.

Case 5, Seed and Breed HEU/Th. (U + Thj0, fuel with 93% enriched uranium is loaded
into seed elements and breed elements contain ThO, only. The radial power profile is flat-
tened by the choice of the mixing fraction of seed and breed balls in the inner and outer
radial core zones, and graphite balls are added to the inner zone to adapt the C/HM ratio
to that of the outer zone. In the seed elements the HEU is mixed with some ThO, in order
to achieve a prompt negative Doppler coefficient. Again the heavy metal loading of the
balls is essentially the same as that in the AVR and the feasibility of the loading of
the breed elements is being tested.

The mass flow data for the equilibrium cycle of each of the five cases are pre-
sented in Table 4.4-7. The high thermal cross sections of 23%Pu, 2%0Pu and 2%1Pu, the
soft spectrum, and the Tow self-shielding of the fuel element design lead to a very high
in-situ utilization of the fissile plutonium (95% for the MEU/Th cycles). In addition,
the high burnup results in the low discharge plutonium fissile fractions shown in Table
4.4-7. The buildup of plutonium isotopes in the MEU/Th cycle is shown in Fig. 4.4-1.

Table 4.4-8 presents Uj0g requirements of the various once-through cycles.”s8 The
30-yr cumulative U30g demands for the MEU/Th once-through cycle and the HEU/Th once-
through cycle were determined by explicit 30-yr calculations.® The 30-yr cumulative U;0q
demands for the LEU, the seed-and-breed MEU/Th and the seed-and-breed HEU/Th cycles were
determined from the U30g demand for the equilibrium cycles and estimates of the inventory
of the startup core and of the requirements for the approach to equilibrium.8

As can be seen from Table 4.4-8, from the viewpoint of U30g utilization for once-
through cycles in the PBR, LEU fuel is the least favorable and HEU/Th fuel is the most
favorable with MEU/Th fuel having a U30g utilization between HEU/Th and LEU fuel. It should
be noted that the cases presented in Table 4.4-8 do not include recycle of the bred fissile
material. Under these no-recycle constraints the MEU/Th cases have a 30-yr U30g demand com-
parable to a PWR operating with uranium and self-generated Pu recycle (see Case F, Table
4.1-3). Thus if recycle were performed with the MEU/Th PBR cases, significantly less U30g
would be required than for the PWR with U and Pu recycle. One option for the recycle in the
seed-and-breed MEU/Th PBR case would be to cycle the fertile balls back into the feed stream
(without reprocessing) for an additional pass through the pebble bed if the irradiation
behavior of the fertile balls permits.

4,5, LIQUID-METAL FAST BREEDER REACTORS

T. J. Burns
Oak Ridge National Laboratory

A preliminary analysis of the impact of denatured fuel on breeder reactors was
performed by Argonne National Laboratory,! Hanford Engineering Development Laboratory,?
and Oak Ridge National Laboratory3 for a variety of fissile/fertile fuel options. The
analysis concentrated principally on oxide-fueled LMFBRs due to their advanced state of
development relative to other potential breeder concepts.

" Table 4,5-1 summarizes some of the significant design and performance parameters
for the various LMFBR designs considered. The procedure followed by each analysis group
in assessing the impact of alternate fuel cycles was essentially the same. A reference
design (for the Pu/238U cycle) was selected and analyzed, and then the performance para-
meters of alternate fissile/fertile combinations were calculated by replacing the refer-
ence core and blanket material by the appropriate alternative material(s).

As indicated by Case 1 in Table 4.5-1, a different reference design was selected
by each group, emphasizing different design characteristics. The three basic designs do
share certain characteristics, however. Each is a "classical" LMFBR design consisting of
two core zones of different fissile enrichments surrounded by blankets (axial and radial)
of fertile material. In assessing the performance impact of various fissile/fertile com-
binations, no attempt was made to modify or optimize any of the designs to account for
the better thermophysical properties (e.g., melting point, thermal conductivity, etc.)
of the alternate materials relative to the reference system. (Note: The question of
selection and subsequent optimization of proliferation-resistant LMFBR core designs is
currently being addressed as part of the more detailed Proliferation-Resistant Core
Design study being carried out by DOE and its contractors.)"

In all cases ENDF/B-IV nuclear data’ were utilized in the calculations. The ade-
quacy of these nuclear data relative to detailed evaluation of the denatured fuel cycle in
fast systems is open to some question. Recent measurements of the capture cross section
of 232Th,6 the primary fertile material in the denatured fuel cycle, indicate significant
discrepancies between the measured and tabulated ENDF/B-IV cross sections for the energy
range of interest. Additionally, the adequacy of the nuclear data for the primary de-
natured fissile species, 233U, for the LMFBR spectral range has also been questioned.’

Due to these possible nuclear data uncertainties and also to the lack of design optimiza-
tion of the reactors themselves, it is prudent to regard the results tabulated in
Table 4.5-1 as preliminary evaluations, subject to revision as more data become available.

The compound system fissile doubling time given in Table 4.5-1 was calculated using
the simple approximation that

where RF is the reprocessing recovery factor (0.98). While such an expression is not
absolutely correct, it does provide a measure of the relative growth capability of each
reactor. Since the data summarized in Table 4.5-1 are based on three separate reference
LMFBRs operating with a variety of design differences and fuel management schemes, the
above expression was used simply to provide relative values for each system. It should
also be noted that some reactor configurations listed have dissimilar core and axial

blanket materials and thus would probably require modifications to standard reprocessing
procedures,

The data presented in Table 4,5-1, although preliminary, do serve to indicate cer-
tain generic characteristics regarding the impact of the alternate LMFBR fuel options. By
considering those cases in which similar core materials but different blanket materials
are utilized it is clear that the choice of the blanket material has only a rather small
effect on the reactor physics parameters. On the other hand, the impact of changes in the
core fissile and fertile materials is considerable, particularly on the breeding ratio.
Utilizing 233 as the fissile material results in a significant decrease in the breeding
ratio relative to the corresponding Pu-fueled case (ranging from ~ 0.10 to 0.15, depending
on the system). This decrease is due primarily to the lower value of v (neutrons produced
per fission) of 233U relative to 23%uy and 2*1Pu. Somewhat compensating for the difference
in v is the fact that the capture-to-fission ratio of 233 is significantly less than that
of the two plutonium isotopes. The differences in breeding ratios given in Table 4.5-1
reflect the net result of these two effects, the decrease in-v clearly dominating. Use of
233 as the fissile material also results in a slight decrease in the fissile inventory
required for criticality. This is due to two effects, the lower capture-to-fission ratio
of 233y relative to the plutonium isotopes, and the obvious decrease in the atomic weight
of 233Y relative to Pu (~ 2.5%).

. The replacement of 238 by 232Th as the core fertile material also has a significant
impact on the overall breeding ratio regardless of the fissile material utilized. As the
data in Table 4.5-1 indicate, there is a substantial breeding ratio penalty associated
with the use of 232Th as a core material in an LMFBR. This penalty is due to the much
lower fast fission effect in 232Th relative to that in 238U (roughly a factor of 4 lower).
The fertile fast fission effect is reflected in the breeding ratio in two ways. First,
although the excess neutrons generated by the fission of a fertile nucleus can be sub-
sequently captured by fertile material, their production is not at the expense of a
fissile nucleus. Moreover, the fertile fission effect produces energy, thereby reducing
the fission rate required of the fissile material to maintain a given power level. Since
both these effects act to improve the breeding ratio, it is not surprising that use of
Th-based fuels result in significant degradation in the breeding ratio. A further
consequence of the reduced fast fission effect of 232Th is a marked increase in fissile

inventory required for criticality, evident from the values given in Table 4.5-1 for the
required initial loadings.

The calculations for LMFBRs operating on denatured 2330 fuel cover a range of enrich-
ments. Cases 5, 6, and 7 assume an ~12% enrichment, Case 8 a 20% enrichment, and Case 9
a 40% enrichment. All these reactors are, of course, subject to the breeding ratio penalty
inherent in replacing plutonium with 233U as the fuel material. The less denatured cases
(8 and 9) also reflect the effect of thorium in the LMFBR core spectrum. (These higher
enrichment cases were calculated in an attempt to parameterize the effect of varying the
amount of denaturing.) A further point which must be addressed regarding the denatured
reactors is their self-sufficiency in terms of the fuel material 233U. Since the denatured
LMFBRs typically contain both 232Th and 238U as potential fissile materials, both 233U and
239py are produced via neutron capture. Thus in evaluating the self-sufficiency of a fast
breeder reactor, the 233U component of the overall breeding ratio is of primary importance
since the bred plutonium cannot be recycled back into the denatured system. As illustrated
schematically by Fig. 4.5-1, the 233U component of the breeding ratio increases as the
allowable denatured enrichment is increased (which allows the amount of thorium in the fuel
material to be increased). More importantly, the magnitude of the 233U component of the
breeding ratio is very sensitive to the allowable degree of denaturing at the lower enrich-
ments (i.e., between 12% and 20%). The overall breeding ratio decreases as the allowable
enrichment is raised, but a concomitant and significant decrease in the required 233U makeup
presents a strong incentive from a performance viewpoint to set the enrichment as high as
is permitted by nonproliferation constraints. In fact, based on the data summarized in
Table 4.5-1, the lowest enrichment Timit feasible for the conventional LMFBR type systems
analyzed. lies in the 11-14% (inner-outer core) range. Such a system would utilize all UO,
fuel and would require significant amounts of 233U as makeup. (It should be noted that
the 233U/Th system is not denatured. It is included in Fig. 4.5-1 because it represents
an upper bound on the 233U enrichment.)

Since all denatured reactors require an initial inventory of 233U, as well as varying
amounts of 233U as makeup material, a second class of reactors must be considered when
evaluating the denatured fuel cycle. The purpose of these systems would be to produce the
233y required by the denatured reactors. Possible LMFBR candidates for this role are the
Pu/238U reactor with thorium blankets (Cases 2 and 3), a Pu/Th reactor with thorium blankets
(Case 4), and a 233U/Th breeder (Case 10).* In the reduced-proliferation risk scenario, all
three of these systems, since they are not denatured, would be subject to rigorous safe-
guards and operated only in nuclear weapon states or in internationally controlled energy
centers. Performance parameters for these three types of systems. are included in Table
4.5-1, and the isotopic fissile production (or destruction) obtained from the ORNL calcu-
lations is schematically depicted by Fig. 4.5-2. Clearly, each system has its own unique
properties, From the standpoint of 233U production capability, the hybrid Pu/Th system is

clearly superior. However, it does require a large quantity of fissile plutonium as makeup
since it essentially "transmutes" plutonium into 233U, The Pu/238U system with the thorium
radial blanket generates significantly less 233 but also markedly reduces the required
plutonium feed. In fact, for the case illustrated, this system actually produces a slight
excess of plutonium. The 233U/Th breeder, characterized by a very small excess 233U pro-
duction, does not provide a means for utilizing the plutonium bred in the denatured systems,
and thus it does not appear to have a place in the symbiotic systems utilizing energy-center
reactors paired with dispersed reactors. (The coupling of each type of fissile production
reactor with a particular denatured system is considered in Section 7.2.)

As a final point, preliminary estimates have been made of the safety characteristics
of some of the alternate fuel cycle LMFBRs relative to those of the Pu/238U reference
cycle. Initial calculations have indicated that the reactivity change due to sodium voiding
of a 233U-fueled system is significantly smaller than that of the corresponding Pu-fueled
system.8 Thus, the denatured reactors, since they are fueled with 233U, would have better
sodium voiding characteristics relative to the reference system. However, for oxide fuels
the reported results indicate that the Doppler coefficient for ThO,-based fuels is com-
parable to that of the corresponding 238U0,-based fuels.

4.6. ALTERNATE FAST REACTORS

4.6.1. ‘Advanced Oxide-Fueled LMFBRs

T. J. Burns
Oak Ridge National Laboratory

One method of improving the breeding performance of the LMFBRs discussed in the
previous section is to increase the core fertile loadings. Typically, this goal is
accomplished by one of two means: redesign of the pins to accommodate larger pellet
diameters or the use of a heterogeneous design (i.e., intermixed core and blanket
assemblies). To maintain consistency with the “classical” designs considered in the
previous section, using the same fuel elements for both concepts, the latter option was
pursued to assess the impact of possible redesign options. Table 4.6-1 summarizes some
preliminary results from calculations for a heterogeneous reactor core model consisting
of alternating concentric fissile and fertile annuli (primed cases) and compares them
with results from calculations for corresponding homogeneous cores {unprimed cases).

As the data in Table 4.6-1 indicate, the heterogeneous configuration results in a
significant increase in the overall breeding ratio relative to the corresponding homo-
geneous calculation. The heterogeneous reactors also require a much greater fissile
loading for criticality due to the increase in the core fertile loading. However, the
increase in the breeding gain more than compensates for the increased fissile require-
ments, resulting in an overall improvement in the fissile doubling time. On the other hand,
because of the high fissile loading requirements, it appears that a heterogeneous model for
the denatured cases with 12% enrichment (cases 6 or 7 of the previous section) is unfeasible;
therefore, an enrichment of ~ 20% was considered as the minimum for the denatured heterogene-
ous configuration.

While the denatured heterogeneous «configurations result in an increase in the
overall breeding ratio, it is significant that the 233y component of the breeding ratio
also improves. Figure 4.6-1 depicts the breeding ratio components for both the homo-
geneous and heterogeneous denatured configurations. (Again, the 233U/Th LMFBR is included
as the upper limit.) As Fig. 4.6-1 indicates, the heterogeneous configurations are
clearly superior from the standpoint of 233U self-sufficiency (i.e., requiring less
makeup requirements). Moreover, if enrichments in the range of 30% - 40% are allowed,
it appears possible for a denatured heterogeneous reactor to produce enough 233U to
satisfy its own equilibrium cycle fuel requirements. Production reactors would therefore
be required only to supply the initial inventory plus the additional makeup consumed
before the equilibrium cycle is reached.

possible production reactors all show significant increases in the quantity of 233y
produced. The net production rates are illustrated schematically by Fig. 4.6-2. More
importantly, however, use of a heterogeneous core design will allow the isotopics of the
fissile material bred in the internal blankets to be adjusted for changing demand
requirements without modifying the driver assemblies. For example the internal blankets
of the Pu/Th LMFBR could be either ThO, or 238U0,, depending on the demand requirements
for 233 and Pu.

4.6.2. Carbide- and Metal-Fueled LMFBRS

D. L. Selby
P. M. Haas H. E. Knee
Oak Ridge National Laboratory

Another method that is being considered for improving the breeding ratios of LMFBRs
and is currently under development! is one that uses carbide- or metal-based fuels. The
major advantages of the metal- and carbide-based fuels are that they will require lower
initial fissile inventories than comparable oxide-based fuels and will result in shorter
doubling times. This is especially true for metal-based fuels, for which doubling times
as Tow as 6 years have been calculated.2 Since for fast reactors the denatured fuel cycle
would have an inherently lower breeding gain than the reference plutonium-uranium cycle,
these advantages would be especially important; however, as discussed below, before either
carbide- or metal-based fuels can be fully evaluated, many additional studies are needed.

Carbide-Based Fuels

Carbide-based fuels have been considered for use as advanced fuels in conventional Pu/U
LMFBRs. Burnup levels as high as 120,000 MWD/T appear feasible, and the fission gas release
js less than that for mixed oxide fuels.3 Carbide fuels also have a higher thermal conduc-
tivity, which allows higher linear power rates with a lower center-line temperature. In
general, the breeding ratio for carbide fuels is higher than the breeding ratio for oxide

fuels but lower than that for metal fuels.

Both helium and sodium bonds are being considered for carbide pins. At present 247
carbide pins with both types of bonds are being irradiated in EBR-II. Other differences in
the pins include fuel density, cladding type, cladding thickness, type of shroud for the
sodium-bonded pin, and various power and temperature conditions. The lead pins have already

achieved a burnup level of 10 at.%, and interim examinations have revealed no major problems.

Thus there appears to be no reason why the goal of 12 at.% burnup cannot be achieved.

In terms of safety, irradiated carbide fuel releases greater quantities of fission gas
upon melting than does oxide fuel. Depending upon the accident scenario, this could be
either an advantage or a disadvantage. Another problem associated with carbide fuels may
be the potential for large-scale thermal interaction between the fuel and the coolant [see
discussion of potential FCIs (Fuel-Coolant Interactions) below].

Metal-Based Fuels

Reactors with metal-based fuels have been operating in this country since 1951
(Fermi-I, EBR-I, and EBR-II). Relative to oxide- and carbide-fueled systems, the metal-
fueled systems are characterized by higher breeding ratios, lower doubling times, higher
heat conductivity, and lower fissile mass. These advantages are somewhat offset, however,
by several disadvantages, including fuel swelling problems that necessitate operation at
Tower fuel temperatures. :

Most of the information available on metal fuels is for uranium-fissium (U-Fs) fuel.
(Fissium consists of extracted fission products, principally zirconium, niobium, molyb-
denum, technetium, ruthenium, rhodium, and palladium.) Some information is available
for the Pu/U-Zr and U/Th alloy fuels but none exists on Pu/Th metal fuels. (The U/Th
fuels do not require the addition of another metal for stability.) In terms of irradiation
experience, approximately 700 U-Fs driver fuel elements have achieved burnups of 10 at.%
without failure. Less irradiation information is available for the Pu/U-Zr alloy, with
only 16 Pu/U-Ir encapculated elements having been irradiated to 4.6 at .% burnup.* Fast
reactor experience with U/Th fuels is also quite limited; however, a recent study at
Argonne National Laboratory has shown that the irradiation performance of U/Th fuels should
be at least as good as that of U-Fs fuels.S

With respect to safety, one concern with metal fuels is the possibility of thermal
interactions between the fuel and the cladding. For most metal alloys, the fuel will swell
to contact the cladding between 3 and 5 at.% burnup. This effect has been observed in
irradiation experiments; however, for burnups up to 10 at.% , no more than 4% of the
cladding has been affected. Thus whether or not fuel-cladding interactions will be a
limiting factor for fuel burnup remains to be determined.

For transient overpower (TOP) analysis, the behavior of U/Th elements has been shown
to be superior to the behavior of the present EBR-II fuel (uranium with 5% fissium), the U/Th
elements having a 1360°C failure threshold versus 1000°C for the EBR-II elements. Thus
U/Th metal pins would have a higher reliability during transients than the fuel pins already in
use in fast reactors. On the other hand, fuel-coolant interaction (FCI) accidents may pre-
sent a major problem, more so than for carbide fuels (see below).

Potential for Large-Scale FCIs

The potential for a large-scale FCI that would be capable of producing mechanical
work sufficient to breach the reactor vessel and thereby release radioactivity from the
primary containment has been an important safety concern for LMFBRs for a number of years.
The assumed scenario for a large-scale FCI is that a large mass of molten fuel (a major
portion of the core) present as the result of an hypothetical core disruptive accident
(HCDA) contacts and "intimately mixes with" about the same mass of liquid sodium. The
extremely rapid heat transfer from the molten fuel (with temperatures perhaps 3000 to
4000%K) to the much cooler sodium (~1000%K) produces rapid vaporization of the sodium.
If the mixing and thermal conditions are ideal, the potential exists for the vaporiza-
tion to be extremely rapid, i.e., for a vapor "explosion" to occur with the sodium vapor
active as the working fluid to produce mechanical work,

A great deal of laboratory experimentation, modeling effort, and some "in-pile"
testing has been carried out in this country and elsewhere to define the mechanisms for
and the necessary-and-sufficient conditions for an energetic FCI or vapor explosion for

 
 

 

4-60

given materials, particularly for oxide LMFBR fuel and sodium. Although there is no con-
clusive theoretical and/or experimental evidence, the most widely accepted theory is that
for an energetic vapor explosion to occur, there must be intimate Tiquid-liquid contact
of the fragmented molten fuel particles and the contact temperature at the fuel-sodium
surface must exceed the temperature required for homogeneous nucleation of the sodium.

A considerable amount of evidence exists to suggest that for oxide fuel in the reactor
environment, the potential for a large-scale vapor explosion is extremely remote, The
key factor is the relatively low thermal conductivity of the oxide fuel, which does not
permit rapid enough heat transfer from the fuel to cause the fuel-sodium contact tempera-
ture to exceed the sodium homogeneous nucleation temperature,

The primary difference between carbide and/or metal fuels as opposed to oxide fuels
is their relatively higher thermal conductivity. Under typical assumed accident conditions,
it is possible to calculate coolant temperatures which exceed the sodium homogeneous nuclea-
tion temperature, This does not mean, however, that a large-scale FCI will necessarily
occur for carbide-sodium or metal-sodium systems. As noted above, these theories as mecha-
nisms for vapor explosion have not been completely substantiated. However, insofar as
the homogeneous nucleation criterion is adequate, it is clear that the potential for large-
scale vapor explosion, at least in clean laboratory systems, is greater for carbide or
metal in sodium than for oxide in sodium. Continued theoretical and experimental study is
necessary to gain a thorough understanding of the details of the mechanisms involved and to

estimate the likelihood for vapor explosion under reactor accident conditions for any
breeder system.

Breeding Performance of Alternate Fuel Schemes

Table 4.6-2 shows that in terms of fissile production, the reference Pu/U core
with U blankets gives the best breeding performance regardless of fuel type (oxide, car-
bide, or metal). For the carbide systems considered, a heterogeneous core design using
Pu/U carbide fuel with a U carbide blanket gives a breeding ratio of 1.550. For the metal
systems considered, a nominal two-zone homogeneous core design using U-Pu-Zr alloy fuel
gives a breeding ratio of 1.614.

The increased fissile production capability of the carbide and metal fuels is
especially advantageous for the denatured cycles. A breeding ratio as high as 1.4 has
been calculated for a metal denatured system, and the breeding ratio for a carbide de-
natured system is not expected to be substantially smaller. However, a good part of the
fissile production of any denatured system is plutonium. Thus the denatured system is
not a good producer of 233U, However, when used with the energy park concept, where the
plutonium produced by the denatured systems can be used as a fuel, the denatured carbide
and metal uranium systems are viable concepts. Metal and carbide concepts may also prove
to be valuable as transmuter systems for producing 233U from 232Th,

Of the thorium metal systems considered, the U/Pu/Th ternary metal system was found to
to be the best 233 producer. Irradiation experiments have shown that the U/Pu/Th alloy can
be irradiated at temperatures up to 700°C with burnups of up to 5.6 at.%.5 Beginning-of-
cycle breeding ratios around 1.4 have been calculated for this system, and it appears that
optimization of core and blanket geometry may increase the breeding ratio to as high as 1.5.
It is also clear that the equilibrium cycle breeding ratio may be as much as 10% higher due
to the flux increase in the blankets from the 233U production. This system not only is a pure
233y producer (no plutonium is produced), but also acts as a plutonium sink by burning plu-
tonium produced in light-water reactors.

Summary and Conclusions

Both carbide- and metal-based fuels have larger breeding gains and potentially lower
doubling times than the oxide-based fuels. When the proliferation issue is considered in the
design aspect (especially for 233y/Th concepts with their inherently lower breeding gains),
these advantages are enhanced even more. In tight of the emphasis on proliferation-
resistant nuclear design, the carbide- and metal-fueled reactors have the potential to
contribute extensively to the energy requirements of this country in the future. However,
the first step is to establish carbide and metal fuel data bases similar to the present
data base for oxide fuels, particularly for safety analyses. Present development plans for
carbide and metal fuels call for a lead concept selection for the carbide fuels by ~1981,
with the metal fuel selection coming in 1984,

4.6.3 Gas-Cooled Fast Breeder Reactors

T. J. Burns
Oak Ridge National Laboratory

In addition to the sodium-cooled fast reactors discussed above, the impact of the various
alternate fissile/fertile fuel combinations on the Gas-Cooled Fast Breeder Reactor (GCFR) has
also been addressed {although not to the degree that it has for the LMFBR). A 1200-MWe Pu/U
GCFR design with four enrichment zones was selected as the reference case.?-8 The various
alternative fissile/fertile fuel combinations were then substituted for the reference fuel.

No design modifications or optimizations based on the alternate fuel properties were per-
formed. It should also be emphasized that the results of this scoping evaluation for
alternate-fueled GCFRs are not comparable to the results given in Section 4.5 for LMFBRs
due to markedly different design assumptions for the reference cases.

The results of the preliminary calculations for the alternate-fueled GCFRs, sum-
marized in Table 4.6.3, reflect trends similar to those shown by LMFBRs; i.e., relative
to the reference case, a significant breeding ratio penalty occurs when 233U is used as
the fissile material and 232Th as the core fertile material. Moreover, the magnitude
of the penalty (ABR) is larger for the GCFR than for the LMFBR. Owing to the helium
coolant, the characteristic spectrum of the GCFR is significantly harder than that of
a comparably sized LMFBR. In light of the relative nuclear properties of the various
fissile and fertile species discussed in Section 4.5, this increased penalty due to the
harder spectrum is not surprising. The number of neutrons produced per fission (v) of
the fissile Pu isotopes in the GCFR is significantly higher than the number produced in
the softer spectrum of an LMFBR. The value of v for 2330, on the other hand, is rela-
tively insensitive to spectral changes. Hence, the larger penalty associated with
233|).based fuels in the GCFR is due to the better performance of the Pu reference system
rather than to any marked changes in 233U performance. A similar argument can be made
for the replacement of core fertile material. Owing to the harder spectrum, the fertile
fast-fission effect is more pronounced in the GCFR than in an LMFBR. Thus, the reduction
in the fertile fission cross section resulting from replacement of 238U by 232Th results
in a larger decrease in the breeding ratio. It should also be noted that as in the LMFBR
case, 233U-fueled GCFRs require smaller fissile inventories than do the corresponding
Pu-fueled cases,

The better breeding performance of Pu in the harder spectrum of the GCFR, on the
other hand, indicates that the GCFR would be a viable candidate for the role of energy
center "transmuter," either as a Pu/Th system or as a Pu/U + ThO, radial blanket system.
It must be emphasized, however, that these conclusions are tentative as they are based

should also be noted that evaluation of which type of reactor is best suited for a given

7 capital cost, possible introduction date, etc.

5.0. INTRODUCTION

T. J. Burns
Oak Ridge National Laboratory

Currently, a major portion of the nuclear generating capacity in the U.S. consists
of LWRs operating on the LEU once-through cycle. Implementation of the denatured 233U fuel
cycle will require that the nuclear fuel cycle be closed; thus research and development
efforts directed at nuclear fuel cycle activities, that is, reprocessing, fabrication of
fuel assemblies containing recycle material, etc., will be necessary, as well as research
and development of specific reactor systems designed to utilize these alternate fuels. To
date, most fuel cycle R&D has been directed at closing the Pu/U fuel cycle under the
assumption that plutonium would eventually be recycled in the existing LWRs. With the
exception of the HTGR (for which a 330-MWe prototype reactor is undergoing testing at Fort
St. Vrain), and the Light Water Breeder Reactor (LWBR) at Shippingport, Pa., U.S. reactors
have not been designed to operate on thorium-based fuels, and thus the R&D for thorium-
based fuel cycles has not received as much attention as the R&D for the Pu/U cycle. As a
result, any strategy for implementation of the denatured fuel cycle on a timely basis must
be concerned with fuel cycle research and development. It must also be concerned with
reactor-specific research and development since the implementation of the denatured 233
cycle in any reactor will necessitate design changes in the reactor.

The following two sections of this chapter contain estimates of the research and
development costs and possible schedules for the reactor-related research and development
and the fuel-cycle-related research and development required for implementation of the
denatured fuel cycle in the various types of reactors that have been considered in earlier
chapters of this report. It should be noted that these two sections are intrinsically
connected: the implementation of a reactor operating on recycle fuel necessitates the
prior implementation of the reprocessing and fabrication facilities attendant to that fuel,
and conversely, the decision to construct a reprocessing facility for a specific recycle
fuel type is dictated by the existence (or projected existence) of a reactor discharging
the fuel.

5.1. REACTOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS

N. L. Shapiro
Combustion Engineering Power Systems

The discussions in the preceding chapters, and also the discussion that follows in
Chapter 6, all assume that LWRs and advanced converters based on the HTGR, HWR, and SSCR con-
cepts will be available for commercial operation on denatured uranium-thorium (DUTH) fuels
on a relatively near-term time scale. If this commercialization schedule is to be achieved,
substantial reactor-related research and development will be required. The purpose of this
section is to delineate to the degree possible at this preliminary stage of development the
magnitude and scope of the reactor R,D&D requirements necessary for implementation of the
reactors on DUTH fuels and, further, to determine whether there are significant R,D&D cost
differences between the reactor systems. The requirements listed are those believed to be
necessary to resolve the technical issues. that currently preclude the deployment of the
various reactor concepts on DUTH fuels, and no attempt is made to prejudge or to indicate
a preferred system.

It is to be emphasized that the proper development of reactor R,D&D costs and schedules
would require a comprehensive identification of design and licensing problems, the development
of detailed programs to address these problems, and the subsequent development of costs and
schedules based upon these programs. Unfortunately, the assessment of alternate converter
concepts has not as yet progressed to the point that problem areas can be fully identified,
and so detailed development of R,D&D programs is generally impractical at this stage. Con-
sequently, we have had to rely on somewhat subjective evaluations of the technological status
of each concept, and upon rather approximate and somewhat intuitive estimates of the costs
required to resolve the still undefined problem areas. A more detailed development of the
requirements for many of the candidate systems will be performed as part of the characteriza-
tion and assessment programs currently under way in, the Nonproliferation Alternative Systems
Assessment Program (NASAP).

In general, reactor R,D&D requirements can be divided into two major categories:
(1) the R,D&D pertaining to the development of the reactor concept on its reference fuel
cycle; and (2) the R,D&D necessary for the deployment of the reactor operating on an altern-
ate fuel cycle such as a DUTH fuel cycle. In the discussion presented here it is assumed
that, with the exception of the HTGR (whose reference fuel cycle already includes thorium),
the reference cycles of the advanced converters would initially be the uranium cycle (i.e.,
235/238) and that no reactor would employ DUTH fuel until after its satisfactory per-
formance had been assured in'a large-plant demonstration. Although it is possible to
consider the development of advanced converters using DUTH fuel as their reference fuel
cycle, such simultaneous development could be a potential impediment to commercialization
since surveys of the utility and manufacturing sectors! indicate a near universal reluctance to
embark on either a new reactor technology or a new fuel cycle technology, largely because

of the uncertainties with respect to reactor or fuel cycle performance, economics, licens-
ability, and the stability of government policies. Thus attempts to introduce a new re-
actor technology conditional upon the successful development of an untried fuel cycle tech-
nology would only compound these concerns and complicate the already difficult problem of
commercialization. The development of advanced converter concepts intended initially for
uranium fueling would allow research and development, design, and the eventual demonstra-
tion of the concept to proceed simultaneously with the separate development of the DUTH
cycle. ’

The R,D&D related to the reactor concept itself typically can be divided into three
components:

(1) Proof of principle (operating test reactor of small size).
(2) Design, construction, and operation of prototype plant (intermediate size).

(3) Design, construction, and operation of commercial-size demonstration plant (about
1000 MWe).

Each stage typically involves some degree of basic research, component design and testing,
and licensing development. In certain instances, various stages of the development can be
bypassed. This is particularly true of technologies representing only a modest departure
from the present reactor technology, in which case prototype reactor construction may be
bypassed completely and demonstrations performed on commercial-size units. If a decision is
made to do this, the time required to introduce commercial-size units can be shortened, but
financial risks are increased because of the larger capital commitment required for full-
scale units. On the other hand, total R&D costs are somewhat reduced, since some fraction
of the R&D required for prototype design usually proves not to be applicable to large-plant
design.

It is also possible in certain instances to perform component R&D and design for the
prototypes in such a fashion that identical components can be used directly in the demon-
stration units. Thus, by employing components of the same design and size in both systems
the R&D necessary to scale up components could be avoided. ’

Each of the three advanced converter reactors discussed in this section has already
proceeded through the proof-of-principle stage. Of these, the HTGR is the most highly develop-
ed within the United States, with a 330-MWe prototype currently operating (the Fort St. Vrain
plant}. HWRs have received much less development within the United States, but reactors of
this type have been commercialized in the Canadian CANDU reactor. However, due to differences
in design between the CANDU and the HWR postulated for U.S. siting (ror example, the ex-
pected use of slightly enriched fuel in a U.S. HWR) and also to differences in licensing
criteria, it would still be desirable to construct a U.S. prototype plant before proceeding
to the commercial-size demonstration plant phase.. The SSCR represents only a modest
departure from the design of PWRs already operating, but even so, the construction and
operation of a prototype plant would also be the logical next stage in the evolution of this
concept.

As has been pointed out above, relatively rapid introduction schedules for the
various reactors have been postulated in the nuclear power scenarios described in Chapter
6. This is because one of the objectives of this report is to establish the degree to
which advanced converters and the denatured uranfum-thorium (DUTH) cycle can contribute to

improved uranium resource utilization so as to defer the need for plutonium-fueled breeder

reactors and to eliminate from further consideration those concepts which cannot contribute
significantly to this goal even if rapidly introduced. The SSCR is assumed to be intro-
duced in 1991 and HWRs and HTGRs in 1995. In view of the time requirements for plant
construction and licensing, it is clear that the prototype plant stage will have to be
bypassed if these introduction dates are to be achieved. Consequently, for the discussion
below it has been assumed that the program for each reactor will be directed toward the
construction of the demonstration plant. This reactor/fuel cycle demonstration is in

turn divided into two parts: one consisting of the generic reactor R&D required to

provide the basic information necessary for the design and licensing of a commercial-size
demonstration facility; and another consisting of the final design, construction, and
operation of the facility. For this demonstration program, continued government funding
has been assumed because of the substantial R&D and first-of-a-kind engineering costs that
will be incurred and because of the increased risks associated with bypassing the prototype

stage.

In considering fuel-cycle-related reactor R,D&D, it is assumed that the demonstration
of the reactor concept on its reference cycle has been accomplished and only that R,D&D re-
quired to shift to an alternate cycle (specifically a DUTH cycle) need be addressed.* The
basic types of fuel-cycle-related reactor R,D&D are:

(1) Data-base development.
(2) Reactor components development.

(3) Reactor/fuel cycle demonstration.

The purpose of the data base development R&D is to provide physics verification and
fuel performance information necessary for the design and licensing of reactors operating on
the subject fuel cycle; the intent here is to provide information similar to that which has
been developed for the use of mixed-oxide fuels in LWRs. Physics verification experiments
have typically consisted of critical experiments to provide a basis to demonstrate the ability
of analytical models to predict such important safety-related parameters as reactivity level,
coefficients of reactivity, and poison worths. Safety-related fuel performance R&D might
consist of such aspects as fuel rod irradiations to establish in-reactor performance and
discharge isotopics; special reactor experiments to establish such parameters as in-reactor
swelling, densification, center-line temperature and fission gas release; and tests of the

*Note that the R,D&D requirements included are those related to the design, licensing and
operation of the reactor only. The requirements for developing the fuel cycle itself are
considered separately (see Section 5.2). The prime example of such fuel-cycle-related
reactor R,D&D is that already performed for plutonium recycle. Here, fairly extensive
R,D&D was performed both by the government and by the private sector to develop reactor
design changes and/or reactor-related constraints, licensing information, and in-reactor
demonstrations to support the eventual utilization of mixed-oxide fuels.

performance of the fuel during anticipated operational transients. Since such safety-related
fuel performance information would be developed as part of the fuel recycle program dis-
cussed in Section 5.2, the R&D costs for this aspect are mentioned here only for completeness.

Reactor components development has been included since, in principle, the use of
alternate fuels might change the bases for reactor design sufficiently that additional com-
ponents development could be required. The extent of the reactor design modifications re-
quired to accommodate a change from a reactor's reference fuel to denatured fuel would, of
course, vary with the reactor type. ;

The third aspect of fuel-cycle-related R&D is the reactor/fuel cycle demonstration.
This demonstration includes the core physics design and safety analysis, which identifies
any changes in design basis events or in reactor design necessitated by the denatured
uranium-thorium fuel cycles, the preparation of an analysis report (SAR), and the subse-
quent in-reactor demonstration of substantial quantities of denatured fuels.

In summary, a number of assumptions have been made to arrive at a point of refer-
ence for evaluating the research and development required for reactors to be commercialized
on a DUTH fuel cycle within the postulated schedule. In particular, it has been assumed
that the prototype plant stage either has been completed or can be bypassed for HTGRs,
HWRs, and SSCRs, and thus the remaining R,D8D related to the reactor concept itself is
that required to operate a commercial-size demonstration plant. The demonstration plants
are based on each reactor's reference fuel rather than on a DUTH fuel; to convert the
reactors to a DUTH fuel will require additional R,D&D that will be fuel-cycle-related.

For the LWRs, which have long passed the demonstration stage on their reference fuel, all
the reactor R,D&D required to operate the reactors on a DUTH fuel is fuel-cycle-related.

The demonstration program in this case would be the demonstration of DUTH fuel in a
current-generation LWR. (Note: This discussion does not consider reactor R,D&D to
substantially improve the resource utilization of LWRs, which, as is pointed out in
Section 4.1 and Chapters 6 and 7, is currently being studied as one approach for increas-
ing the power production from a fixed resource base.) -
. ,

This evaluation has also required that assumptions be made regarding the degree of
financial support that could be expected from the government. These assumptions, and the
criteria on which they are based, are presented in the discussions below on each reactor
type. While the assumptions regarding government participation are unavoidably arbitrary
and may be subject to debate, it is to be pointed out that basically the same assumptions
have been made for all reactor types. Thus the reader may scale the costs presented to
correspond to other sets of assumptions.

Finally, it is to be noted that while the nuclear power systems included in this
study of the denatured 233 fuel cycle include fast breeder reactors, no estimates are
included in this section for FBRs. Estimated research and development cost schedules. for

the LMFBR on its reference cycle are currently being revised, and a study of the denatured
fast breeder fuel cycle, which includes fast transmuters and denatured breeders, is included
as part of the INFCE program (International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation). The results
from the INFCE study should be available in the near future.

5.1.1. Light-Water Reactors

Preliminary evaluations of design and safety-related considerations for LWRs operat-
ing on the conventional thorium cycle indicate thorium-based fuels can be employed in LWRs
with little or no modification. Consequently, the R&D costs given here have been estimated
under the assumption that denatured fuel will be employed in LWRs of essentially present
design. This assumption is not meant to exclude minor changes to reactor design (for
example, changes in the number of control drives, shim loadings, or fuel management, etc.)
but rather reflects our current belief that design changes necessitated by DUTH fuels will
be sufficiently straightforward so as to be accommodated within the engineering design
typically performed for new plants.

As has been described in the discussion above, the first phase of such fuel-cycle-
related research consists of the development of a data base from which safety-related
parameters and fuel performance can be predicted in subsequent core physics design and
safety analysis programs. First, existing thorium materials and fuel performance infor-
mation should be thoroughly reviewed, and a preliminary evaluation of safety and licensing
issues should be made in order to identify missing information and guide the subsequent
development program. Although this initial phase is required to fully define the required
data base R&D, it is possible to anticipate in advance the need to establish information
in the areas of physics verification and safety-related fuel performance.

As shown in Table 5.1-1, the physics verification program under data base develop-
ment is estimated to cost ~$10 million. This program should be designed both to provide
the information required to predict important safety-related physics parameters and to
demonstrate the accuracy of such predictions as part of the safety analysis. Improved
values must be obtained for cross sections of thorium and of isotopes in the thorium
depletion chains, such as 233U and protactinium, all of which have been largely neglected
in the past. Resonance integral measurements should also be performed for denatured fuels
both at room temperature and at elevated temperatures, such experiments being very im-
portant for accurately calculating safety-related physics characteristics and also for
establishing the quantities of plutonium produced during irradiation. Finally, an LWR
physics verification program should include a series of critical experiments, preferably
both at room temperature and at elevated moderator temperatures, for each of the fuel
types under consideration (i.e., for thorium-based fuels utilizing denatured 235U, denatured
233, or plutonium). These experiments would serve as a basis for demonstrating the adequacy
of the cross-section data sets and of the ability of analytical models to predict such
safety-related parameters as reactivity, power distributions, moderator temperature
reactivity coefficients, boron worth, and control rod worth.

The fuel performance program under LWR data-base development would consist of the
establishment of safety-related fuel performance information such as transient fuel damage
limits, thermal performance both for normal operation and with respect to LOCA* margins on
stored heat, dimensional stability (densification and swelling), gas absorption and release
behavior, and fuel cladding interaction. The initial phase of this program should consist
of in-reactor properties experiments, power ramp tests, transient fuel damage tests, and
fuel rod irradiations. The in-reactor properties experiments would be similar to the
program currently underway in Norway's Halden HWR and would be designed to provide informa-
tion on such parameters as center-line temperature, swelling and densification, and fission-
gas release during operation. The power ramp experiments would consist of preirradiation
of the fuel rod segments in existing LWRs and the subsequent power ramping of these segments
in special test reactors to establish anticipated fuel performance during power changes
typically encountered in the operation of LWRs. Examples of such programs are the inter-
national inter-ramp and over-ramp programs currently being undertaken at Studsvik. The
transient fuel damage experiments would be designed to provide information on the performance
of the denatured fuels under the more rapid transients possible during operation and in
postulated accidents. Lastly, the fuel rod irradiation experiments would provide informa-
tion on the irradiation performance of prototypical thorium-based fuel rods, and, with
subsequent post-irradiation isotopic analyses, would also provide information on burnup
and plutonium production. (As noted previously, the fuel performance program costs are
included, though not specifically delineated, under the fuel cycle R,D&D discussed in

Section 5.2.)

In addition to the data base development, some as yet unidentified reactor components
development could be expected. To cover this aspect of the program, an estimated cost of
$5 - $25 million is included in Table 5.1-1.

The remaining fuel-cycle-related R&D for LWRs would be devoted to developing core
design changes and safety analysis information in preparation for a reactor/fuel cycle
demonstration. In this phase of the program, safety-related behavior of alternate fuel
would be determined using the specific design attributes of the demonstration reactor.

The effects of alternate fuel cycles on plant safety and licensing would require examina-
tion of safety criteria and the dynamic analyses of design basis events. Appropriate
safety criteria, such as acceptable fuel design limits and limits on maximum energy deposi-
tion in the fuel, would have to be determined. Changes in core physics parameters that
result from alternate fuel loadings and the implication of these changes on reactor design
and safety would also have to be identified and accommodated within the design. For
example, changes in fuel and moderator temperature reactivity coefficients, boron worth,
control-rod worth, prompt-neutron lifetime and delayed-neutron fraction must be addressed
since they can have a large impact on the performance and safety of the system. The ef-
fects of alternate fuel cycles on the dynamic system responses should be determined for all
transients required by Regulatory Guide 1.70, Revision 2. It would also be necessary to
determine the implications of denatured fuel cycles on plant operation and load change
performance to determine whether the response of plant control and protection systems is

altered. A safety analysis report for denatured thorium fuels would be prepared as part
of this development task and pursued with licensing authorities through approval.

The reactor development cost associated with commercializing the LWR on the DUTH fuel
cycle is thought to be about $200 million. This relatively low cost results from the com-
mercial status of the LWR and from the relatively small risk associated with deploying a
new fuel type, since if the demonstration program is unsuccessful, the reactor can always
be returned to uranium fueling. The estimated cost for the light-water reactor is based
on an assumed 25% government subsidy for a three-year in-reactor demonstration. The 25%
subsidy is intended primarily to ensure the sponsoring utility against the potential for

decreased reactor availability which might result from unsatisfactory performance of the

DUTH fuel. (The cost of the fuel itself is included in the fuel recycle development costs
discussed in Section 5.2.)

5.1.2. High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactors

Although a number of alternate high-temperature gas-cooled reactor technologies have
been or are being developed by various countries, this discussion considers the reactor con-
cept developed by the General Atomic Company. U. S. experience with high-temperature gas-
cooled reactors dates from March 3, 1966, when the 40-MWe Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station
became operable. More recently, the 330-MWe Fort St. Vrain HTGR plant has been completed
and is currently undergoing initial rise-to-power testing. Consequently, HTGR status in
the U. S. is considered to be at the prototype stage and the basic reactor development
still required is that associated with the demonstration of a large plant design. Al-
though the success of the Fort St. Vrain prototype cannot be fully assessed until after

several years of operation, in this discussion satisfactory performance of the Fort St.
Vrain plant has been assumed.

" Cost estimates for the R&D requirements for the development of a large commercial
HTGR on its reference HEU/Th cycle are shown in Table 5.1-2. These estimates include only
that R&D required relative to the Fort St. Vrain plant. As -these tables indicate, the
majority of the R&D expenditures would be directed toward component R&D and component

- design, specifically for the development of the PCRV {prestressed concrete reactor vessel),

steam generator, instrumentation and control, materials and methods, and the main helium
circulators and service systems. In addition, an estimated $30 million to $60 million

would be required for licensing and preparing a safety analysis report for the initial
power reactor demonstration program.

The cost of a power reactor demonstration plant for the HTGR on its reference cycle
would be significantly higher than the cost given earlier for an LWR on a DUTH cycle,
reflecting the increased cost and risk associated with deploying new concepts. In
developing the potential reactor demonstration costs for the HTGR, we have assumed that
a substantial government subsidy (50%) would be required for the first unit. Since it
will be necessary to commit at least the second through fifth of a kind prior to the
successful operation of this initial demonstration unit if the postulated deployment

in Canadian plants, while other design modifications such as higher operating pressures can be demonstrated in the lead plant of the large plant

schedule is to be maintained, our costs presume further governmental support will be nec-
essary (a 25% subsidy is assumed) for the second through fifth units. As noted in Table

5.1-2, a 50% subsidy of the first unit is expected to be about $400 million, and a 25%

subsidy of the next four units is expected to total $700 million. Since the assumptions

“underlying government subsidies of the reactor demonstration program shown in Table 5.1-2

have been defined, these costs can be adjusted to reflect either different levels of govern-
ment support or a change in the overall cost of the demonstration program.

As has been stated above, it has been assumed that the advanced converters such as
the HTGR would all be successfully demonstrated on their reference cycles before they are
converted to DUTH cycles. However, since the reference cycle for the HTGR is already a
thorium-based cycle, it is likely that a denatured cycle could be designated as the
reference cycle for this reactor and thus that the lead plant demonstration program would
be for a DUTH-fueled HTGR. If this were done, the additional costs required to convert
the HTGR to a denatured fuel might be smaller than those associated with converting LWRs
from their uranium-based fuel cycle to a thorium-based cycle.

5.1.3. Heavy-Water Reactors

Although a number of alternate heavy-water reactor concepts have been developed by
various nations, only the CANDU pressurized heavy-water reactor has been deployed in sig-
nificant numbers. Therefore, as noted previously, the CANDU reactor is taken as the
reference reactor for deployment in the United States. The R&D cost can vary considerably,
depending on whether developed Canadian technology is utilized or whether the U.S. elects
to independently develop a heavy-water-reactor concept. It is assumed here that the U.S.
HWR will be based on the CANDU-PHWR and deployed under Canadian license and with Canadian
cooperation. Thus, our costs address only those aspects required to extend the present
CANDU design to that of a large plant (1,000-MWe) for U.S. siting. An order of magnitude
higher R&D commitment would be required if it were necessary to reproduce the development
and demonstrations which the Canadians have performed to date.

Research and development requirements for the HWR are included in Table 5.1-2. In-
herent in these requirements is the assumption that although the U.S. design would be based
on the CANDU-PHWR, significant changes would have to be made in order to realize a com-
mercial offering in the U.S. These modifications consist of the development of a large
plant design (1,000-MWe), the use of slightly enriched fuel both to improve resource
utilization and to reduce power costs, modifications of the HWR design to reduce capital
cost (the practicality of which is generally related to the use of slightly enriched fuel),
and modifications required for U.S. licensing.

The rather large range of potential R&D costs shown in Table 5.1-2, particularly
for licensing and SAR development, is indicative of the uncertainty introduced by
licensing, i.e., to the degree to which the HWR will be forced to conform to licensing
criteria developed for the LKR.

 
 

 

 

The first aspect of large plant design and licensing R&D, identified as component
R&D, is related primarily to the extension of the CANDU to 1,000 MWe, the use of slightly
enriched fuel, and possible increases in system pressure so as to reduce effective capital
cost. In general, increasing the power output of the HWR to 1,000 MWe should be more readi-
1y accomplished than with other concepts such as the LWR, since it can be accomplished
simply by adding additional fuel channels and an additional coolant Toop. The use of
slightly enriched fuel and higher operating pressures should result in no fundamental
changes to CANDU design, but nevertheless will necessitate some development in order to
accommodate the higher interchannel peaking expected with slightly enriched fuels and the
effect of higher system pressures on pressure-tube design and performance. Modifications
for U.S. siting are somewhat difficult to quantify since a thorough licensing review of
the HWR has yet to be completed. Although there is no doubt of the fundamental safety of
the CANDU, modifications for U.S. siting and licensing are nevertheless anticipated for
such reasons at differing seismic criteria (due to the differing geology between the U.S.
and Canada) and because of differing licensing traditions. Additional experimental informa-
tion on the performance of slightly enriched uranium fuel should also be developed by ir-
radiating such fuel in existing HWRs (such as in Canada's NPD plant near Chalk River) to
the discharge burnups anticipated for the reference design (about 21,000 MWe/TeM). Methods
of analyzing the response of the HWR to anticipated operational occurrences and other
postulated accidents will have to be developed and approved by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, and a safety analysis report in conformance with NRC criteria will have to be

developed and defended.

As is the case for the HTGR, the cost for a power demonstration plant for the HWR
would be significantly higher than the cost for a DUTH-fueled LWR. The large plant demon-
stration costs shown in Table 5.1-2 have been estimated under the same set of assumptions

used for estimating the HTGR plant.

The cost of a program to convert an HWR from its reference uranium cycle to denatured
fuel would be approximately equal to that previously described for the LWR.

5.1.4. Spectral-Shift-Controlled Reactors

As was noted in Chapter 4, the SSCR consists basically of a PWR whose reactivity
control system utilizes heavy water instead of soluble boron to compensate for reactivity
changes during the operating cycle. Since the SSCR proof-of- principle has already been
demonstrated by the operation of the BR3 reactor in Belgium, and since various components
required for heavy-water handling and reconcentration are well established by heavy-water
reactor operating experience, the SSCR is considered to be at a stage where either a
prototype or a large power plant demonstration is required.

\

For most alternative reactor concepts at this stage of development, a prototype
program would be necessary because of the capital cost and high risk associated with

bypassing the prototype stage and constructing a large power reactor demonstration. Such
a prototype program may also be desirable for the SSCR, particularly if the prototype pro-
gram involved the modification of an existing PWR for spectral-shift control rather than
the construction of a wholly new plant for this purpose. However, the estimates of the
reactor R&D requirements given for the SSCR in Table 5.1-2 are based on the assumption
that this prototype stage is bypassed. This can be justified on the basis that the SSCR is
rather unique among the various alternatives because of its close relationship to present
PWR technology. In particular, no reactor development would be required and the reactor
could be designed so that the plant would be operated in either the conventional poison
control mode or in the spectral-shift control mode. As a result, a great majority of the
capital investment in the plant and the power output of the plant itself is not at risk.
Likewise, the potential for serious licensing delays is largely mitigated, since the reac-
tor could initially be operated as a poison-controlled PWR and easily reconfigured for

the spectral-shift control once the licensing approvals were obtained. Consequently, the
capital at risk is limited to the additional expenditures required to realize spectral-
shift control, roughly $30 - $60 million for component R&D, plus rental charges on the
heavy water inventory. The additional expenditures for design and licensing, $20 - $50
million, would have also been necessary for the prototype.

The component R&D would consist of a thermal-hydraulic development task; valves and
seal development; development of D,0 upgrader technology; and refueling methods development,
design and testing. The thermal-hydraulic tests would be designed to produce a departure
from nucleate boiling correlation for the SSCR moderator similar to that which has been
developed for the PWR light-water moderator. The correlations are expected to be very
similar, but tests to demonstrate this assumption for the various mixtures of heavy and
light water will be required.

Valves and seal development will be necessary in order to minimize leakage of the
heavy-water mixture; reduction of coolant leakage is important both from an economic

* standpoint (because of the cost of D,0) and because of the potential radiological hazard

from tritium which is produced in the coolant. Methods of reducing coolant leakage from
valves and seals have been extensively explored as part of the design effort on heavy-
water reactors and utilization of heavy-water reactor experience is assumed. The R&D
program would address the application of the technologies developed for the heavy-water
reactor to the larger size components and higher pressures encountered in the SSCR.

The D,0 upgrader employed in the SSCR is identical in concept to the upgraders used
on heavy-water reactors and in the last stage (finishing stage) of D,0 production facilities.
The sizing of various components in the upgrader would, however, be somewhat different for
SSCR application because of the range of D,0 concentration feeds (resulting from the
changing D,0 concentration during a reactor operating cycle), and because of the large
volume of low D,0 concentration coolant which must be upgraded toward the end of each
operating cycle. The upgrader R&D program would consider the sizing of the upgrader,

 
 

 

 

and should also address methods of minimizing the D,0 inventory in the upgrader so as to
minimize D,0 inventory charges.

Lastly, component R&D should address methods for refueling and for coolant exchange
during refueling. Refueling should be performed with pure light water present in the reac-
tor (so as to avoid the radiological hazard of tritium); the light water must subsequently be
replaced with the light-water/heavy-water mixture prior to initiating the next operating
cycle. In order to accomplish this refueling/coolant exchange without necessitating large
volumes of heavy water for this purpose, a modified bleed-and-feed procedure is being ex-
plored in which the differences in density between the warm water in the core and the cool
makeup water is exploited in order to minimize coolant mixing and the amount of excess D,0
inventories required. Scale tests of this refueling procedure (or any other refueling/
coolant exchange procedure selected) will be required.

The R&D related to safety and licensing should consist first of data development for
the SSCR operating on the uranium fuel cycle. This data base has been partially developed
in the initial SSCR development work performed by the USAEC in the 1960s. However, additional
work, primarily in the area of physics verification of safety-related parameters (i.e., critical
experiments which establish reactivity predictions, power distributions, D,0 worths, and con-
trol rod worths) are required for uranium fuel. The second aspect of the safety and licens-
ing R&D should consist of a preliminary system design, the performance of a safety analysis
for the SSCR, and the development of a safety analysis report for spectral-shift-control
operation. At this stage, component design and development would be limited to those areas
in which some design changes would be required in order to ensure that the consequences of
postulated accidents and anticipated operational occurrences with the SSCR would be comparable
to those for the conventional PWR.

The main areas thought to require attention are the implications of coefficients of
reactivity on accidents that result in a cool-down of the primary coolant, the D,0 dilution
accident, and tritium production. The implications of ‘the spectral-shift mode of control
on plant operation and load change performance should also be addressed as part of the
preliminary design evaluation.

With respect to the large plant demonstration of the SSCR, the financial risk to
utilities would be limited to the extra capital equipment required to realize spectral-shift
control. Because the proposed schedule for commercialization is more rapid for the SSCR
than for any of the other advanced converters, it has been assumed here that the government
would essentially purchase the extra equipment required for the first five units (at $25 mil-
lion per unit). In the case of the first unit, additional funding to mitigate the lower
capacity factors anticipated for an experimental unit have been added. Also the cost for
the first unit includes the carrying charges on the D,0 inventory. D,0 carrying charges
are not included for the second through fifth units since it should be possible to
demonstrate the spectral-shift control on the first unit before the D,0 for the remaining
units needs to be purchased, so that a decision to employ spectral-shift control in sub-
sequent units would be one which is purely commercial in nature.

It is unlikely that an-SSCR would be converted to the denatured fuel cycle unless a
similar change had previously occurred in the LWR. In this case, only a demonstration of
the performance of denatured fuel in the spectral-shift mode of control would be needed.
These incremental costs are estimated to be $10 - $60 million.

5.1.5. R,D&D Schedules

Schedules for completing the R,D&D effort delineated above are summarized in Fig.
5.1-1. Although it can be argued that, given strong governmental support both in funding
and in helping usher the various concepts through the licensing process, these schedules
could be accelerated, the schedules shown are thought to be on the optimistic side of what
can reasonably be expected to be achieved. In particular, a nine-year period has been as-
sumed for the design, licensing and construction of a new reactor type; this would appear
somewhat optimistic since it is currently taking longer to bring conventional LWRs on line.
It should also be noted that in general the time scale required to develop alternate fuel
cycle technologies (cf. Section 5.2) is estimated to be at least as long, and sometimes
longer, than that required to develop reactor-related aspects. In general, this is because
test facilities (for example, to perform demonstration irradiation) are available either
in the U.S. or in Canada, so that R&D work prior to the design, licensing, and construction
of a large demonstration plant could be rapidly initiated.

5.1.6. Summary and Conclusions

It has been the purpose of this section to delineate the magnitude and scope of reac-
tor R,D&D expenditures associated with the use of DUTH fuel in converter reactors and to
determine if there are significant R,D&D cost differences between reactor systems. Recom-
mendations for the further development of specific denatured reactors are provided in
Section 7.5 where the RAD requirements discussed here are weighed against the potential

benefits of various nuclear power systems utilizing denatured fuels, as presented in
Chapter 6.

In developing the nuclear power scenarios examined in Chapter 6, it was recognized
that the benefits of operating:LWRs and alternate reactor types on DUTH fuels are dependent
upon the speed and extent to which the systems can be deployed. Since the primary goal of
this interim report is to establish whether there is an incentive for DUTH- fueled systems,
a rather rapid deployment schedule was assumed so that the maximum benefits that could be
anticipated from each reactor/fuel cycle system could be determined. Systems for which
there is insufficient incentive for further development could thus be identified and eliminated
from further consideration. Trade-offs between the prospects for commercialization, R&D
costs, and deployment schedules and economic/resource incentives could then be evaluated
in greater detail for the remaining options.

The most rapid deployment schedule considered to be feasible was one in which time
was allowed to resolve technical problems but one that was largely unimpeded by commercializa-
tion considerations. The R,D&D schedules that have been presented in this section are
consistent with this approach. However, it is recognized that the high-risk factors and
potentially unfavorable near-term economics of such a schedule would make it unattractive
to the private sector, especially for those systems requiring large-plant demonstration.
Demonstration program costs are viewed as highly uncertain and dependent upon the specific
economic incentives for each reactor/cycle concept and on such factors as the licensing
climate and general health of the industry prevailing at the time of deployment. Thus the
costs associated with the R,D&D schedules are assumed to be largely government financed.

A comparison of the total estimated costs to the government for the various reactor
systems discussed above is presented in Table 5.1-3. As noted, the R,D&D costs are lowest

for the LWR on denatured fuel because of the already widespread deployment of this reactor
concept. It is assumed that all basic R&D required for commercialization of LWRs operat-
ing on their reference fuel cycle (LEU) has been completed, and that the use of denatured
fuel can be demonstrated in current-generation LWRs. Thus, an LWR demonstration plant,

as such, will not be required. The commitment of an LWR to DUTH fuels will entail some
risks, however, and a 25% government subsidy is assumed to be necessary for a three-year
demonstration program.

 
 

 

 

5-20

The R,D&D costs are highest for the HTGR and HWR, which are yet to be demonstrated
on their reference cycles for the large unit size (1000-MWe) postulated in this report.
The cost of these demonstration units constitutes the largest fraction of the total esti-
mated R,D&D costs, although substantial costs will also be incurred for large plant design
and licensing, which includes component R&D, component design, and licensing and SAR
development. The R,D&D requirements for the HTGR and HWR are judged to be similar under
the assumption that experience equivalent to that of the Fort St. Vrain HTGR prototype
can be obtained from Canadian technology. The SSCR is viewed as having R,D&D costs
intermediate between those of the LWR and those of the HTGR because of the heavy reliance
of the SSCR on LWR technology. As has been discussed in the text, once these reactors
have been demonstrated on their reference cycles, additional R,D&D will be required to
convert them to DUTH fuels.

5.2. FUEL RECYCLE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS

I. Spiewak
Oak Ridge National Laboratory

The purpose of this section is to summarize the technical problems that must be ad-
dressed by a fuel recycle research and development program before reactor systems producing
and using denatured uranium-thorium (DUTH) fuels can be deployed commercially. Preliminary
estimates of the schedule and costs for such a program are also included to provide some
perspective on the commitments that will be required with the introduction of reactors
operating on denatured fuels. Wide ranges in the estimates reflect the current uncertain-
ties in the program. However, detailed studies of the research and development requirements
for the recycle of DUTH fuels are now being conducted by the DOE Nuclear Power Division's.
Advanced Fuel Cycle Evaluation Program (AFCEP), and when the results from these studies be-
come available, the uncertainties in costs and schedules should be reduced. ‘

5.2.1. Technology Status Summary

The technological areas in a fuel recycle program cover fuel fabrication/refabrication
(fuel material preparation, rod fabrication, element assembly); fuel qualification (irradia-
tion performance testing and evaluation); fuel reprocessing (headend treatment, solvent
extraction, product conversion, off-gas treatment); and waste treatment (concentration, cal-
cination, vitrification, and radioactive-gas treatment).

Fuel Fabrication/Refabrication and Qualification

In general, the basic technology for the fabrication of uranium oxide pellet fuels is
established, with the fabrication of both LWR and HWR uranium fuels being conducted on a
commercial scale. In contrast, Pu/U oxide pellet fuels have been fabricated only on a small
pilot-plant scale, and a significant amount of research and development is still required.
Areas requiring further study include demonstration of:

(1) a pelletizing process to ensure uniform product characteristics and performance;
(2) methods for verifying and controlling the characteristics of the Pu/U fuels;

(3) processes for the recovery of contaminated scrap;

(4) a reliable nondestructive assay system for powders, fuel rods, and wastes;

(5) the ability to operate a large-scale plant remotely, but with hands-on maintenance
(in the case where Pu/U oxides containing high quality plutonium are being fabricated);
and ’ :

(6) satisfactory irradiation performance of Pu/U fuels produced in commercial-scale
processes and equipment.

 
 

5-22

In the case of metal-clad oxide fuels that are thorium based, the areas requiring
further study are essentially the same as those listed above for the Pu/U oxide fuels; how-
ever, in contrast to Pu/U-oxide fuels, where significant effort has already been devoted
toward resolving this list of areas, relatively little R&D has been performed to date for
thorium-based fuels and consequently a larger amount of research and development would be
required. The intense radioactivity of the decay daughters of 2320 (which is produced in the
thorium along with the 233U) requires that the refabrication processes all be remotely
operated and maintained. This requirement will necessitate additional development of the
refabrication processes and may require the development of new fabrication methods. The
qualification of U/Th and Pu/Th oxide fuels will also require additional R&D efforts.

HTGR fuels are coated uranium oxide or carbide microspheres embedded in a graphite
fuel element. The process and equipment concepts for refabricating HTGR fuel remotely
have been identified; however, additional R&D prior to construction of a hot demonstra-
tion facility is needed. This should cover:

(1) the scaleup of refabrication equipment,
(2) the recycle of scrap material,
(3) the control of effluents, and

(4) the assay of fuel-containing materials.

Additional R&D will also be required for qualification of the recycle fuel.

While the reference HTGR fuel cycle already includes thorium, further development work
will be required to fabricate DUTH fuels for HTGRs because of the requirement of a higher
uranium content of the fissile particle and the increased production of plutonium during

irradiation.

Fuel Reprocessing

The basic technology for reprocessing of uranium and uranium/plutonium oxide pellet
fuels with low burnup exists in the Purex process. This technology is based on many years
of government reprocessing experience with military-related fuels; however, a commercial
reprocessing plant for mixed oxide power reactor fuels that conforms to current U.S. federal
and state requirements has not yet been operated. Additionally, while engineering or
pilot-scale work has been successfully carried out on all important processes and components
of the reprocessing plant, operability, reliability, and costs of an integrated plant have
not been demonstrated in all cases at fuel exposures expected in commercial reactors.
Specific areas that still require development work include the following:

(1) operation and maintenance of the mechanical headend equipment;
(2) ‘methods for handling highly radioactive residues that remain after the dissolution
of high-burnup fuel;

(3) the technology for reducing radioactive off-gas releases (e.g., Kr-85, iodine and
tritjum) to conform to anticipated regulations;

(4) remotely operated and directly maintained conversion processes for plutonium from
power reactor fuels; and \

(5) high-level waste solidification and vitrification to prepare for terminal storage.

The technology for reprocessing thorium-based oxide pellet fuels is less advanced than
that for uranium-based fuels. The Thorex process has been used to process irradiated thori-
um oxide fuels of low burnup in government plants and in limited quantities in a small-scale
industrial plant. Thorium oxide fuels have not been processed in a large-scale plant specif-
ically designed for thorium processing, nor has highly irradiated thorium oxide fuel
been processed by the Thorex process in engineering-scale equipment.

The principal differences between the reprocessing development required to reprocess
metal-clad thorium-based oxide fuels and graphite-based HTGR fuel occur in the headend
treatment. Partitioning of fuel materials from both classes of reactor fuel can then be
accomplished by a Thorex-type solvent extraction process.

In the case of metal-clad oxide fuels, additional headend process R&D is required to
determine how zirconium cladding can be removed and the ThU, fuel dissolved. Significant
waste handling problems may be encountered if fluoride is required to .dissolve ThO,.

In the case of the headend process development for graphite-based HTGR fuels, develop-
ment work is needed with irradiated materials in the crushing, burning and particle separation
operations, and in the treatment of 1*C-containing off-gases associated with the headend
of the reprocessing plant.

Specific areas of solvent extraction process development work required to reprocess
all thorium-containing reactor fuel include:
(1) fuel dissolution, feed adjustment, and clarification;
(2) technology. development for containing 22%Rn and other radioactive gases to conform to
regulations;
(3) recovery of fully irradiated thorium in large-scale facilities;
(4) partitioning of fuel solutions containing U, Pu, and Th;
(5) recovery and handling of highly radioactive product streams;
(6) - process and equipment design integration; and
(7) high-level waste concentration and vitrification.

Waste Treatment

Waste treatment R&D requirements common to all fuel cycles involve development of
the technology needed for immobilizing high-level and intermediate-level solid and gaseous
wastes. Processes for concentration, calcination, and vitrification of these are needed.
The waste treatment requirements for the various fuel cycles are similar, but they would
be more complex for the thorium-based cycles if fluorides were present in the wastes.

5.2.2. Research, Development, and Demonstration Cost Ranges and Schedules

While fuel recycle R&D needs can be identified for a variety of alternate fuel
cycles and systems, the launching of a major developmental effort to integrate these
activities into a specific integrated fuel cycle must await a U.S. decision on the fuel
cycle and reactor development strategy that would best support.our nonproliferation objec-
tives and our energy needs. Whether it would be more expeditious to develop individual
cycles independently in separate facilities or to plan for an integrated recycle develop-
ment facility will depend on the nature and timing of that decision. If a number of related
cycles were developed in the same facilities, the total costs would be only moderately
higher than the costs associated with any one cycle. Since the denatured 233 cycle implies
a system of symbiotic reactors (233U producers and 233U consumers), such an approach is
likely to be attractive if a decision were made to develop the denatured 233U cycle.

The existence of major uncertainties in .the fuel recycle development and demonstration
programs make cost projections highly uncertain. There are, first, difficulties inherent in
projecting the costs of process and equipment development programs which address the resolu-
tion of technical problems associated with particular reactors and fuel cycles. In addition,
there are uncertainties common to projecting costs and schedules for all fuel recycle develop-
ment programs; specifically, uncertainties in the future size of the commercial nuclear in-
dustry cause problems in program definition. It is necessary to identify the reactor growth
scenario associated with the fuel cycle system so that fuel loads can be projected and
typical plant sizes estimated. This is critical from the standpoint of establishing the
scale of the technology to be developed and the principal steps to be covered in the
development. For example, if the end use of a fuel cycle is in a secure energy center,
smaller plants are involved and the development could conceivably be terminated with a
plant that would be considered a prototype in a large (1500 MT/yr) commercial reprocessing
facility development sequence. Similarly, growth rates for particular reactor types may be
much. smaller than others, or the fuel loads may be smaller because of higher fuel burnup.
Thus, smaller fuel cycle plants would be required.

The problem is further complicated by the fact that the fuel recycle industry has
for a number of years been confronted with uncertain and escalating regulatory requirements.
Permissible radiation exposure levels for operating personnel, acceptable safeguards
systems, and environmental and safety requirements, all of which affect costs, have not
been specified. Nevertheless, based upon experience with previous fuel recycle develop-
ment programs, typical fuel recycle R,D&D costs for the fuel cycles of interest can be pre-
sented in broad ranges. In the past, reprocessing costs had been developed for the U/Pu
systems with partitioned and decontaminated product streams. These have been used here to
provide base-line costs. Any institutional consideration, such as a secure fuel service
center, that would permit conventional Purex and Thorex reprocessing to take place would
give more credence to the base-line technology development costs used here.

federal government to develop a new reprocessing technology would range between $0.8 billion
and $2.0 billion. The corresponding cost for a new refabrication technology would be

lion. For fuel recycle development,
the costs traditionally borne by

“the government include basic R&D,

construction and operation of
pilot plants, development of large-
scale prototype equipment, and sup-
port for initial demonstration
facilities. To these costs should
be added the costs of the waste
treatment technology development
needed to close the fuel cycle.

The capital costs estimated
for a commercial demonstration
facility are listed separately in
Tables 5.1 and 5.2 because the
extent that the government might
support these facilities is un-
known. Since they will be
commercial facilities, costs
incurred either by the government
or by a private owner could be
recovered in fees. The total
capital costs might range between

$1.0 billion and $3.0 billion for a

large reprocessing demonstration
facility and between $0.7 billion and

$1.4 billion for a refabrication
demonstration facility.

Tables 5.1 and 5.2 show that
the major costs associated with
commercialization of fuel cycles lie

at the far end of the R&D progression, namely, in the steps involving pilot plants, large-scale
prototype equipment development, and demonstration plants, if required. The rate and sequencing
of R&D expenditures can be inferred from Tables 5.2-1 and 5.2-2. Base technology R&D to identify

process and equipment concepts may require 2-6 years. The engineering phase of the development

 
 

 

5-26

program, including hot testing, may require 5-12 years. Reference facility design and con-
struction might require 8-12 years. There can be considerable overlapping of phases so that
for a given fuel cycle the total lapsed time from initial development to commercialization of
fuel recycle ranges from about 12-20 years. The total time would depend upon the initial
technology status, the degree to which the R&D program steps are telescoped to save time, and
the stage to which the development program must be carried. The thorium cycles would be at
the far end of the development time range.

Table 5.2-3 presents the R&D cost ranges in terms of reactor types and fuel recycle
systems. For all fuel cycles, the uncertainty in the R&D costs should be emphasized. Thus,
in water reactors, the estimated range of R&D costs is $1.3-2.3 billion for U/Pu recycle
development, and $1.8-3.3 billion for DUTH recycle development. For HTGRs, the correspond-
ing ranges are $1.4-2.6 billion and $1.8-3.3 billion for U/Pu and DUTH recycle development,
respectively; for FBRs, the corresponding ranges are $1.6-3.0 billion and $2.0-3.6 billion,
respectively. Although there is a significant cost uncertainty for each reactor type and
fuel cycle, for a given reactor type the trend in costs as a function of fuel cycle is
significant. Generally, the reference U/Pu cycle would be least expensive and the DUTH

cycle the most expensive, with the Pu/Th and HEU/Th cycles intermediate.

5.2.3. Conclusions

A decision to develop reactor systems operating on denatured fuel cycles requires a
government commitment to spend $0.5 billion to $2 billion more on a fuel recycle develop-
ment program than would be required to develop reactors operating on the reference
(partitioned, uncontaminated products) U/Pu cycles. "The differential is even larger when
reactors operating on DUTH cycles are compared with reactors operating on once-through
cycles. No comparison has-been made with the costs of developing diversion-resistant U/Pu
cycles (using co-processing, spiking, etc.).

Expenditures to develop recycle systems for DUTH: fuels would span a period of
20 years from initial development to commercialization. The principal expenditures would
occur in the second half of this period, when large facilities with high operating costs
are needed.

6.0. INTRODUCTION

In this chapter civilian nuclear power systems that utilize denatured 233U fuel to
various degrees are analyzed to determine whether they could meet projected nuclear power
demands with the ore resources assumed to be available. The reactors employed in the systems
are those discussed in earlier chapters of this report as being the reactors most likely to
be developed sufficiently for commercial deployment within the planning horizon, which is
assumed to extend to the year 2050. The reactors included are Light Water Reactors (LWRs),
Spectral-Shift-Controlted Reactors (SSCRs), Heavy Water Reactors (HWRs), High-Temperature
Gas-Cooled Reactors (HTGRs), and Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs). In each case, the nuclear
power system is initiated with currently used LWRs operating on the low-enriched 235U fuel
cycle, and other converter reactors and/or fuel cycles are added as they become available.

On the basis of information provided by the reactor designers, it is assumed that 235U-fueled
LWRs alone will be utilized through the 1980s and that LWRs operating on denatured 2330 and
239py will become available in the early 1990s. It is also assumed that SSCRs operating on

the various fuel cycles will become available in the early 1990s. Thus nuclear power systems
consisting of LWRs alone or of LWRs and SSCRs in combination, with several fuel cycle options
being available, could be introduced in the early 1990s. LWR-HWR and LWR-HTGR systems could be
expected in the mid 1990s, and FBRs could be added to any of the systems after the year 2000.

The nuclear power systems utilizing denatured 233U fuel were “ivided into two major
categories: those consisting of thermal converter reactors only aru those consisting of
both thermal converters and fast breeders. Three "nuclear policy options" were examined
under each category, the individual options differing primarily in the extent to which
plutonium is produced and used to breed additional fissile material. For comparison, a
throwaway/stowaway option employing LEU converters was also analyzed, and two options
utilizing the classical plutonium-uranium cycle were studied, one using converters only
and the other using both converters and breeders.

Al11 of the options studied were based on the concept of secure energy centers and
dispersed reactors discussed in previous chapters. Thus, all enrichment, reprocessing, and
fuel fabrication/refabrication activities, as well as fuel and/or waste storage, were assumed
to be confined to the energy centers. In addition, all reactors operating on plutonium or
highly enriched uranium were assigned to the centers, while reactors operating on low-enriched
or denatured uranium were permitted to be outside the centers. Determining the precise nature
and structure of the energy center was not within the scope of this study. Presumably it
could be a relatively small localized area or a large geographical region covering an entire
nuclear state, or even a collection of nuclear states. If more than one country were involved,
the sensitive facilities could be nationally owned but operated under international safeguards.
But whatever the character of the center an important consideration for any nuclear policy op-
tion is its "energy support ratio," which is defined as the ratio of the nuclear capacity
installed outside the center to the capacity installed inside the center. Only as the sup-
port ratio increases above unity is the capability of the system to deliver power to dis-

persed areas ensured - a fact which is particularly important if nuclear states are planning
to provide nuclear fuel assurances to nonnuclear states.

the earliest technologically feasible date.

It was assumed that a nuclear power system was adequate if its installed nuclear capacity
was 350 GWe in the year 2000 and a net increase of 15 GWe/yr was realized each year thereafter,
with the increase sustained by the Uj0g supply. Two different optimizing patterns were
used in the study. A few runs were made assuming economic competition between nuclear
fuel and coal, the plants being selected to minimize the levelized cost of power over
time. These runs, described in Appendix D, indicated that for the assumptions used in
this analysis nuclear power did not compete well at U30g prices above $160/1b; therefore,
in the remaining runs an attempt was made to satisfy the demand for nuclear power with
Us0g available for less than $160/1b U30g. It is these runs that are described in this
chapter. :

The specific assumptions regarding the U30g supply are presented in Section 6.1 below,
which also includes descriptions of the operating characteristics of the individual reactors
utilized, the various nuclear policy options chosen for analyses, and the analytical method
applied. Section 6.2 then compares the results obtained for a selected set of nuclear policy
options, and Section 6.3 summarizes the conclusions reached on the basis of those comparisons.
The economic data base used for these studies is given in Appendix B, and detailed results
for all the nuclear policy options are presented in Appendix C.

6.1... BASIC ASSUMPTIONS AND ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE

6.1.1. The Us0g Supply

The most recent estimates of the supply of U0, available in the United States as re-
ported by DOE's Division of Uranium Resources and Enrichment (URE) are summarized in Table.
6.1-1 (from ref. 1). On the basis of a maximum forward cost of $50/1b, the known reserves
plus probable potential resources total 2,325 x 103 ST. URE estimates that an additional
140 x 103 ST is available from byproducts (phosphates and copper), so that the amount of
U30g probably available totals 2.465 x 103 ST (or approximately 2.5 million). If the
"possible" and "speculative" resources are also considered, the URE estimates are increased
to approximately 4.5 million ST. Neither of these estimates include U30g which may be
available from other U.S. sources, such as the Tennessee shales, or from other nations.*

The actual U30g supply curves used in the analysis were based on the long-run marginal
costs of extracting U30g rather than the forward costs. The long-run marginal costs con-
tain the capital costs of facilities currently in operation plus a normal profit for the
industry; thus they are probably more appropriate for use in a nuclear strategy analysis.
The actual long-run marginal costs used in this analysis are shown in Table B-7 of Appendix
B and are plotted in Fig. 7.4-1 in Chapter 7. These sources show that if the recoverability
of the U30g supply is such that large quantities can be extracted only at high costs, then
the supply available at a cost of less than $160/1b is probably no more than 3 million ST.
If, however, the recoverability is such that the extraction costs fall in what is considered
to be an intermediate-cost range, then as much as 6 million ST U30g could be available at
a cost of less than $160/1b. In the remainder of this study, these two assumptions are
referred to as "high-cost" and "intermediate-cost” U30g supply assumptions.

The rate at which the U30g resource is extracted is at least as important as the size
of the resource base. URE has estimated that it would be difficult for the U.S. to mine
and mill more than 60,000 ST of U30g per year in the 1990's (ref. 3). (Note: This estimate
was based on developing reserves and potential resources at forward costs of less than
$30/1b. These costs do not include capital costs of facilities or industry profits.)
Although the .combined maximum capability of a coalition of states may exceed this, it is
not possible to specify a definite upper limit until more is known about the locations of
the sources of U30g and the difficulties encountered in recovering it. Recognizing this,
and also recognizing that the annual capacity is still an important variable, the nuclear
policy options analyzed in this study were considered to be more feasible if their annual
mining and milling rate was less than 60,000 ST of U30g per year.

*Editor's Note: In 1977 the U.S. produced 15,000 ST of U30g concentrate (ref. 2).

TEditor's Note: In 1977 the U.S. gaseous diffusion plants produced 15.1 million kg SWU per
year (ref. 4). After completion of the cascade improvement program (CIP) and cascade up-
dating program (CUP) in the 1980's, the U.S. capacity will be 27.4 million kg SWU per year
(refs. 5 and 6). A gas centrifuge add-on of 8.8 million SWU has been proposed for the
government-owned enrichment facility at Portsmouth, Ohio. Considerable enrichment capacity
also exists abroad; therefore, enrichment capacity is inherently a less rigid constraint
than uranium requirements or production capabilities.

6.1.2. Reactor Options

The reactor designs included in this study have not been optimized to cover every con-
ceivable nuclear policy option. Such a task is clearly impossible until the options have
been reduced to a more manageable number. However, the designs selected have been developed
by using detailed design procedures and they are more than adequate for a reactor strategy
study such as is described here. oo

ST plus 140 x 103 ST from byproducts (phosphates and copper) total 2,465 x 103 ST (or ~
2.5 million ST). If the possible and speculative resources are included, the total is
increased to 4,505 x 103 ST (or ~ 4.5 million ST).

Four general types of reactors are included: LWRs, represented by Pressurized Water
Reactors (PWRs); HWRs, represented by Canadian Deuterium Uranium Reactors (CANDUs); High
Temperature Gas Cooled Reactors (HTGRs); and Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs). The data for the
PWRs were provided by Combustion Engineering (CE) and Hanford Engineering Development Lab-
oratory (HEDL); the data for the CANDUs by Argonne National Laboratory (ANL); the data for
the HTGRs by General Atomic (GA); and the data for the FBRs by HEDL. In addition to the
standard LWRs (PWRs), spectral-shift-controlled PWRs (SSCRs) are also included in the study,
the data for the SSCRs being provided by CE. Descriptions of the individual reactors used
in the study are given in Tables 6.1-2 and 6.1-3 (ref. 7), and the economic data base for
each is given in Appendix B.

The LKR designs include reactors fueled with low-enriched and denatured 235U, denatured
233y, and plutonium, the diluent for the denatured designs consisting of either 2380 or
thorium, or both. In addition, a low-enriched LWR design optimized for throwaway has been
studied, and also three SSCRs fueled with low-enriched 235U, denatured 233U, and Pu/Th.

The HWRs are represented by three 235U-fueled reactors (natural, slightly enriched,
and denatured), a denatured 233U reactor, a Pu/238U reactor, and a Pu/Th reactor. The HTGR
designs consist of low-enriched, denatured, and highly enriched 235U reactors; denatured*
and highly enriched 233U reactors; and a Pu/Th reactor.

The FBR designs consist of two Pu/238U core designs (one with a 238U blanket and one
with a thorium blanket) and one Pu/Th core design (with a thorium blanket). In addition, a
233))/238y core design with a thorium blanket has been studied. The 233U enrichment is less
than 12%, and thus this FBR is a denatured design.

*In contrast to the other reactor types, the denatured ?33U HTGR design is assumed to contain
15% 2331 in 238y instead of 12%.

Introduction dates for each reactor type are included in Table 6.1-2. A slight modifica~
tion to an existing PWR fuel design, such as a thicker fuel pin cladding to extend the dis-
charge exposure, was introduced in 1981. A more extensive modification, such as a denatured
235 PWR fuel pin, was delayed until 1987. The remaining PWR designs, including the SSCRs,
were introduced in 1991. The HWRs and HTGRs were all introduced in 1995, while the FBRs
were not introduced until 2001.

The lifetime-averaged 233U, 235U, and fissile plutonium flows given in Table 6.1-3 show
that for the throwaway cycle, low-enriched HTGRs offer significant (atmost 20%) uranium ore
savings compared to Tow-enriched PWRs, Slightly enriched HWRs reduce uranium ore require-
ments by an additional 20% over HTGRs and more than 35% over LWRs. Although low-enriched
LWRs and HTGRs have roughly the same enrichment requirements, the slightly enriched HWRs
require 5 to 6 times less enrichment. The low-enriched SSCR offers about a 22% savings in

enrichment.

Core discharge exposures for FBRs are approximately twice the exposures for LWRs,
while exposures for HWRs are about half those for LWRs., An exception is the natural-
uranium HWR, which has a discharge exposure of one-fourth that for the LWR. HTGR dis-
charge exposures are extremely large - nearly 200 MWd/kg for the Pu/Th fuel design.

The two FBRs with Pu-U cores have breeding ratios of 1.34 to 1.36. Replacing the
uranium in the core with thorium reduces the breeding ratio by 0.15, while replacing the
plutonium with 233U reduces the breeding ratio by 0.16. Finally, comparing 235U-fueled
thermal reactors with 233U-fueled reactors shows that the 233U-fueled reactors have con-
version ratios about 0.10 to 0.15 higher,

The most striking observation that can be made from the total fissile fuel requirements
shown in Table 6.1-3 is the significantly lower fissile requirements for the denatured 233U-
fueled SSCRs and HWRs and for the highly enriched 233U/Th-fueled HTGR.

Finally, a few comments should be made about the relative uncertainties of the per-
formance characteristics for the reactor designs in this study. Clearly, the low-enriched
235-fueled LWR (PUR) has low performance uncertainties. Numerous PWRs that have been designed
using these methods are currently in operation. The highly enriched 235U-fueled HTGR also
would be expected to be quite accurate since Fort St. Vrain started up in 1977. For the same
reason, the successful operation of HWRs in Canada gives a high level of confidence in the
natural uranium fueled CANDUs.

‘The Pu-U-fueled FBRs have had a great deal of critical experiment backup, and a few
FBRs have been built in the U.S. and abroad, giving assurance in the calculated performance
parameters of these reactors. Most of the remaining reactors, however, have rather large
uncertainties associated with their performance characteristics. This is because these
reactors have not been built, and most have not even had critical experiments to verify the
designs. The uncertainty for the alternate-fueled reactor designs is even greater since the
effort in developing nuclear data for 233U and thorium has been modest compared to that
expended in developing data for 2350, 238y, and plutonium.

6.1.3. Nuclear Policy Options

Under the assumption that the reactor/fuel cycles listed in Tables 6.1-2 and 6.1-3
could be deployed, a set of nuclear policy options were developed for studying the relative
capabilities of the various reactors to produce civilian nuclear power during the period

from 1980 to 2050. As was pointed out above, it was assumed that for a system to be

adequate, it should have an installed nuclear capacity of 350 GWe by the year 2000 and a
net increase of 15 GWe thereafter, with each plant having a 30-yr lifetime. (Note: In
order to determine the effect of a lower growth rate, a few cases were also run for an
installed capacity of 200 GWe in the year 2000 and 10 GWe/yr thereafter.) It was also
assumed that reactors fueled with natural, low-enriched, slightly enriched, or denatured
uranium could be dispersed outside the secure energy centers and those fueled with highly
enriched uranium or with plutonium would be confined within the centers. All enrichment,
reprocessing, and fabricating facilities would also be confined within the centers.

The nuclear policy options fell under four major categories: (1) the throwaway/
stowaway option; (2) classical plutonium-uranium options; (3) denatured uranium options
employing thermal converters only; and (3) denatured uranium options employing both converters
and breeders, The various options under these categories are described in Table 6.1-4, and
the specific reactors utilized in each option are indicated in Table 6.1-5. Schematic repre-
sentations of the options are presented in Figs. 6.1-1 through 6.1-4. Runs were made for
both intermediate-cost and high-cost U30g supply assumptions.

These nuclear options cannot be viewed as predictions of the future insofar as nuclear
power is concerned; however, they can provide a logic framework by which the future implica-
tion of current nuclear policy decisions can be understood. Suppose, for example, a group
of nations agree to supply nuclear fuel to another group of nations providing the latter
agree to forego reprocessing. A careful analysis of the nuclear system options outlined
above can illustrate the logical consequences of such a decision upon the civilian nuclear
power systems in both groups of nations. Only those nations providing the fuel would main-
tain secure energy centers, since the nations receiving the fuel would be operating dispersed
reactors only. (Note: The analysis presented here considers only the U.S. ore supply. A
similar analysis for a group of nations would begin with different assumptions regarding the
ore supply and nuclear energy demand.)

For the purposes of this analysis, all the nuclear system options were assumed to be
mutually exclusive. That is, it was assumed that any option selected would be pursued to
its ultimate end. In actuality, a nation would have the ability to change policies if con-
sequences of the policy in effect were determined to be undesirable, However, the ability
to successfully change a policy at a future date would be quite limited if the necessity
of changing has not been identified and incorporated into the current program. The purpose
of the study contained in this report was to identify the basic nuclear system options, and
to determine the consequences of pursuing them to their ultimate end. (Note: A study of the
consequences of changing policies at a future date - and thereby the implication of current

programs - will be analyzed in a later study.)

6.1.4. The Analytical Method

The principal components of the analytical method used in this study are illustrated
in Fig. 6.1-5 and are based on the following assumptions:

(1) Given a specified demand for nuclear energy as a function of time, nuclear units
are constructed to meet this demand consistent with the nuclear policy option under
consideration.

(2) As nuclear units requiring U30g are constructed, the supply of U30g is continuously
depleted. The depletion rate is based on both the first core load and the annual reloads
required throughout the life of the nuclear unit. The long-run marginal cost of U;0g is
assumed to be an increasing function of the cumulative amount mined. This is indicative of
a continuous transition from higher grade to lower grade resources.

(3) If the nuclear policy option under consideration assumes reprocessing, the fuel
is stored after discharge until reprocessing is available. After reprocessing, the fissile
plutonium and 233U are available for refabrication and reloading.

(4) A nuclear unit which requires 23°%Pu or 233y cannot be constructed unless the
supply of fissile material is sufficient to provide the first core load plus the reloads
on an annual basis throughout the unit's life.

(5) The number of nuclear units specified for operation through the 1980's is
exogenously consistent with the current construction plans of utilities.

(6) A nuclear plant design which differs from established technology can be intro-
duced only at a limited maximum rate. A typical maximum introduction rate is one plant
during the first biennium, two plants during the second biennium, four during the third,
eight during the fourth, etc.

(7) If the manufacturing capability to produce a particular reactor type is well
established, the rate at which this reactor type will lose its share of the new construction
market is limited to a specified fraction per year. A typical maximum construction market
loss rate is 10%/yr.. This reflects the fact that some utilities will continue to purchase
plants of an established and reliable technology, even though a new technology may offer
an improvement.

The acquisition of fissile material will be the principal goal of any nation embarked
upon a nuclear weapons program. Therefore, any analysis of a diversion-resistant civilian
nuclear power strategy must include a detailed analysis of the nuclear fuel cycle. The
steps in the nuclear fuel cycle which were explicitly modeled in this analysis are shown
in Fig. 6.1-6. They include: the mining of U30g; the conversion of Uj0g to UFg; the
enrichment of the uranium by either the gaseous diffusion technique or the centrifuge

Throwaway/Stowaway Option (see Fig. 6.1-1)

Option 1: LEU (235y/238y) converters? operating on the throwaway/stowaway cycle are permitted outside the energy centers and no reac-
tors are operated inside the centers. Spent fuel is returned to the secure energy centers for ultimate disposal.

Plutonium-Uranium Options (see Fig. 6.1.2)

Option 2: LEU (235U/238Y) converters are operated outside the secure energy centers and Pu/U converters and 235U(HE)Th, 233U/Th,
and Pu/Th HTGR's are permitted inside the centers, Uranium is recycled in all reactors, and plutonium is recycled in energy-center reactors.

Option 3: LEU (235U/238y) converters are operated outside the secure energy centers and Pu/U converters, Pu-U/u breeders, and

235y(HE)/Th, 233Y/Th, and Pu/Th HTGRs are permitted inside the centers. Uranium is recycled in all the reactors, and plutonium is re-

- Option 5T: LEU (23507238) converters and denatured 233y converters are operated outside the energy centers and Pu/Th converters are
permitted inside the centers. The fissile uranium is recycled into the outside reactors and the plutonium into the inside reactors. The
goal in this case is not to minimize the amount of plutonium produced but "transmute” all that is produced to 233U in the energy-center
reactors.

Denatured Uranium Options with Converters and Breeders (see Fig, 6.1-4)

Option 6: LEU (233U/238Y) converters and denatured 2358 and 233( converters are operated outside the energy centers and Pu/Th con-'
verters and Pu-U/Th breeders (Pu-U cores, Th blankets) are permitted inside the centers. ' The fissile uranium is recycled into the outside
reactors and the inside breeders and plutonium is recycled into the inside converters and breeders. With the reactors used, only a light
"Pu-to-233U" transmutation rate is realized. .

Option 7: LEU (2350/2381) converters, denatured 2350 and 233) converters, and denatured 23% breeders are operated outside the energy
centers and Pu/Th converters and Pu-U/Th breeders (Pu-U cores, Th blankets) are permitted inside the centers. The fissile uranium is re-
cycled into the outside reactors and the inside breeders and plutonium is recycled in the inside converters and breeders. With the reactors
used, only a light "Pu-to-233U" transmutation rate is realized. This case represents the first time a denatured breeder is introduced in
the system, }

Option 8: LEU (2350/238y) converters, denatured 2350 and 233 converters, and denatured 2330 breeders are operated outside the energy
centers and Pu/Th converters and Pu-Th/Th breeders (Pu~Th cores, Th blankets) are permitted inside the centers. The fissile uranium is
recycled into the outside reactors and the plutonium into the inside reactors. With the reactors used, & heavy "Pu-to-233U" transmutation
rate is realized. Again a denatured breeder ies utilized in the system.

In all options except Option 1, spent fuel is returned to the secure energy centers for reprocessing. For Option 1, the spent fuel is
returned to the center for ultimate disposal.

BiRs that are fueled with natural or slightly enriched uranium are included in this category.

of fissile and fertile isotopes occurring during power production in the reactor; the storage
of spent fuel, and, if permitted, the reprocessing of spent fuel; the size and composition
of fissile stockpiles as a function of time; and the amount of spent fuel or high-level

waste which must be stored as a function of time. Thus, the amount, composition, and move-
ment of all fissile material in the civilian nuclear power system were accurately calculated
for each case under the nuclear policy options shown in Tables 6.1-4 and 6.1-5.

The cost of each nuclear option and the total power cost of each nuclear unit in

the option were also calculated; however, the total power cost of a nuclear unit did not
determine whether it would be constructed. Generally it was constructed if (1) it was

available in the policy under consideration, and (2) it had a Tower U;0g consumption
rate than the other nuclear units available under the same policy option. This approach
was adopted because it is possible to calculate the U;0g, fissile plutonium, and 233U
requirements of a nuclear unit with reasonable accuracy, while it is very difficult to

the centers, Spent fuel is returned to the secure energy centers for reprocessing. The

fissile uranium is recycled into the converters, but the plutonium is stored inside the
center either for ultimate disposal or for future use at an unspecified date.

calculate the capital, fabrication, and reprocessing costs for the same unit. (Note: An
exception to this philosophy was contained in a set of cases described in Appendix D in
which the U30g supply was assumed to be sufficiently large so as not to impose a practical
Timit on the growth of the nuclear system over the planning horizon. In this case, the
decision to construct--or not to construct--a reactor concept was based on its total

power cost, which of course included the cost of U30g as an increasing function of the

total amount consumed. Thus, while the ability to conserve U;0g did enter into the decision,
it was not the single dominating factor.)

An example of the uncertainty involved in calculating the total power cost of a
nuclear unit in the future is illustrated in Fig. 6.1-7. This figure was developed by
assigning a reasonable set of uncertainties to the capital, fabrication, and reprocessing

‘costs for a set of five reactor concepts with four fuel options for each concept, The

actual costs and their uncertainty are discussed in detail in Appendix B. In all cases,
the costs were assumed to be mature industry. costs during the period 2010 to 2040 with
the price of U30g increasing from $140/1b to $180/1b during this period. The reactor
concepts shown in the figure are the LWR, SSCR, HWR, and HTGR converters and the FBR.

Assessment Study.

As Fig. 6.1-7 illustrates, the total levelized power cost of a reactor concept insofar
as an intercomparison of concepts is concerned is dominated by the uncertainties. In partic-
ular, the total power costs. for those concepts possessing the greatest resource saving (the
HWR and the FBR). exhibit the greatest uncertainties. The effect of the price of U30g is also
significant. Figure 6.1-7 shows that the total power cost of the LWR on the throwaway cycle
is significantly lower if the price of U30g in the year of startup is $40/1b rather than
$140/1b. Co

The levelized power costs given for each reactor system in Fig. 6.1-7 were determined
from the sum of the discounted values of the cash flows associated with the system divided
by the discounted electrical energy production. The cash flows considered were: (1) capital
investment, including the return of the investment and the return on the investment; (2)
fixed charges, such as capital replacements, nuclear liability insurance, etc.; (3) opera-
tion and maintenance costs; (4) income taxes; and (5) fuel expenses. The first four items
are relatively straightforward, with the relevant data given in Appendix B. "The fifth
item, however, merits some additional discussion, particularly as fuel expenses relate to
the valuation of the bred fissile material. For these calculations the cost of bred fis-
sile material was taken to be the "shadow price," which is the value of an additional unit
of fissile material to the particular scenario in question.

The shadow price calculated for the bred fissile material is directly related to the
Us0g prices at and subsequent to the valuation point in time. The value of the bred fis-
sile material thus increases with increasing U304 price which in turn increases as a func-
tion of the cumulative quantity consumed. For the resource-limited scenarios, an additional
unit of 233U or Pu will postpone the purchase of an equivalent amount of U30g, the delay
having a dollar value due to the use of discounted cash flows. For those scenarios which
are not resource-limited, an additional unit of bred fissile material permits: the elimina-
tion of an equivalent amount of U30g. )

Fig. 6.1-7. Total Levelized Power Cost Sensitivity to Capital, Fabrication, and
Reprocessing Cost Uncertainties.

Since the valuation of the bred fissile material is related to the cumulative U;0g
price structure, the rate at which the U30g is consumed during a particular scenario also
affects the time-dependent price calculated for the bred fissile material. Rapid consump-
tion of the resource base {i.e., a high energy demand) yields a rapidly rising shadow

price. Such an effect is readily noticeable in the calculation of the power costs.of
breeder reactors since it is possible for the credit calculated for the bred material to

rr r-

! -- exceed the period's charges for the reactor's inventory. Thus, the net fuel expense for
certain systems producing highly valued fissile material can be negative, resulting in
significant power cost differences when compared to the reactor systems operating with
PE high-cost natural resources. ~ This type of phenomenon is illustrated schematically by
Fig. 6.1-8 in which the power costs of a fast breeder and of an LEU-LWR are plotted as a
function of U30g price. The rising power cost of the LWR is directly attributable to the
increasing fuel expense caused by the U30g price. The declining fast reactor power cost
reflects the increasing value of (and hence larger credit for) the bred material when
compared to Uj0g-derived fissile material. |

The situation is still complicated even if one considers. only the conceptually
\ simple case of the throwaway cycle. From Fig, 6.1-9, where for simplicity the price of
Us0g was assumed to be constant over the life of the plant, it appears that the LUWR is
the least expensive reactor when the U;0g price is less than $60/1b, and that the HWR

rr

will be less expensive than the LWR when the U30g price is greater than $160/1b. However,

| an examination of the uncertainties leads one again to the conclusion that they dominate
the problem, and that conclusions based on economic arguments are tenuous at best. Thus,

| - the decision was made to construct or not construct a nuclear unit on the basis of its
ability to extend the U30g supply rather than on its relative cost.

6.2. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS FOR SELECTED
NUCLEAR POLICY OPTIONS

This section discusses results obtained in this study for a selected set of nuclear
system options that typify the role of nuclear power under different nuclear policy deci-
sions. The intent is to identify the basic issues, to determine the logical consequences
of decisions made in accordance with those issues, and to display the consequences in an
illustrative manner. Detailed results for all the nuclear system options outlined in

Section 6.1 are presented in Appendix C,

6.2.1. The Throwaway/Stowaway Option

 

The throwaway/stowaway cycle (see Fig. 6.1-1) is a conceptually simple nuclear system
option and therefore has been selected as the reference cycle against which all other op-

tions are compared. In order to thorough-
ly understand the implications of the throw-
away cycle, the effect of several deployment
options utilizing the various advanced con-
verters on the throwaway cycle was analyzed
in detail. In general, the analysis assumed
a nuclear growth rate of 350 GWe in the year
2000 followed by a net increase of 15 GWe/yr,
but the consequences of a significant reduc-
tion in the nuclear growth rate were also
considered. In addition, the effect of both
the high-cost and the intermediate-cost

U30g supplies was determined.

A summary of the 30-yr U;0g requirements
for several reactors on the throwaway cycle,
including an LWR with a fuel system designed
for an extended discharge exposure, is
shown in Fig. 6.2.1. In each case, the
average capacity factor of the reactor was
assumed to be 0.67, and the tails composi-

“tion of the enrichment plant was assumed to be 0.0020. As the figure indicates, all the

reactors have lower U30g requirements than the standard LWR, the extended-discharge LWR being
6% lower, the SSCR 16% lower, the HTGR 23% lower, and the slightly enriched HWR 39% lower.
These U30g requirements were calculated for essentially standard designs without elaborate
design optimization. It is recognized that design optimization could improve the reactor
performance characteristics; however, the goal of this analysis was not to delineate the
ultimate role of any particular reactor concept based on current performance characteristics,
but rather to identify the probable role of each reactor concept and the incentive for

improving its performance characteristics.
 

 

 

6-24

The potential nuclear contribution with LWRs on the throwaway cycle, both with and
without a fuel system designed for extended exposure being included, is shown in Fig. 6.2-2
for the high-cost U30g supply. The nuclear contribution passes through a maximum of
approximately 420 GWe installed capacity in about 2010 and declines continuously thereafter,
the system with the LWR-EE providing a slightly greater capacity over most of the period.* The
cumulative capacity constructed throughout the planning horizon is approximately 600 GWe. The
maximum installed capacity is less than the cumulative capacity because new units must be con-
structed to replace those retired during the period. The maximum annual U;0g requirement is
72,000 ST/yr and the maximum annual enrichment requirement is 45 million SWU/yr, neither of
which can be regarded as excessive. Thus, the principal limitation, in this case, is simply
the size of the economic U30g supply.

A more costly U30g supply would, of course, imply a smaller maximum installed
capacity occurring earlier in time, while the converse would be true for a cheaper
U30g supply. As is shown in Fig, 6.2.3, if the U30g supply were a factor of two larger, the
maximum nuclear contribution would increase from approximately 420 GWe to approximately
730 GWe and would occur at about the year 2030. If, on the other hand, the supply were a
factor of two smaller, the maximum nuclear contribution would decrease to approximately
250 GWe and would occur in about the year 2000. A cross-plot of the effect of the -U304 supply
on the maximum installed nuclear capacity for the LWR on the throwaway cycle is shown in
Fig. 6.2-4. It is noted in Fig. 6.2-3 that if the U;05 supply should be as large as 6.0

~ million ST, the maximum annual U30g requirement would be 120,000 ST/yr and the maximum

annual enrichment requirement would be 77 million SWU/yr. Given the probable limitation on
the amount of U30g that could be mined and milled annually, these annual U30g requirements
could be the Timiting factor.

The effect of adding an advanced converter (SSCR, HTGR, or HWR) to a nuclear power
system operating on the throwaway cycle with the high-cost U304 supply is shown in
Fig. 6.2-5. The increase in the nuclear contribution for each of the advanced converter
options is relatively small. At most the maximum installed nuclear capacity increases by
approximately 30 GWe and the year in which the maximum occurs by approximately three
years. Adding the SSCR to an LWR produces a slightly greater nuclear contribution than
adding an HTGR. This may at first appear to be a paradox since the lifetime U;05 require-
ment for the HTGR is less than that for the SSCR (see Fig. 6-2.1), but the 4-yr difference
in introduction dates is sufficient to offset the difference in U30g requirements. (The dif-
ference is not large enough to be significant, however.) The reason that so small an increase
in nuclear capacity is realized by introducing the various converters is that by the time
they dominate the nuclear system a very significant fraction of the U;0g supply has already
been committed to the standard LWR. This is illustrated in Fig. 6.2-6, where an HWR intro-
duced in 1995 does not become dominant until 2010. It follows that if the U30g supply were
larger with the same nuclear growth rate, or if the nuclear growth rate were smaller with the
same U30g supply, the addition of an advanced converter would have a greater impact. This
is illustrated in Fig. 6.2-7, for which the intermediate-cost U30g supply was assumed, and

*Note: In general, unless a system consisting of the standard LWR alone is designated, it 1s
the LWR system including an LWR-EE that is denoted as 1L and compared with other systems in

later sections of this chapter. However, as pointed out here, the installed capacities of
the two LWR systems differ only slightly.

The effect of changing the enrichment tails composition upon the nuclear contribution
with the LWR on the throwaway cycle is shown in Fig, 6.2-9 in which the reference case with
a constant enrichment tails composition of 0.0020 is compared with two other cases: one in
which the enrichment tails composition decreases linearly from 0.0020 in 1980 to 0.0005 in
2010 and remains constant thereafter; and another in which the tails composition similarly
decreases and in addition the tails stockpile accumulated prior to 2010 is mined at a later
date with a tails composition of 0.0005. The decreasing enrichment tails composition, shown
in Fig. 6.2-10, is the industry average, and hence the improving tails strategy implies low-
ering the tails composition of the gasequs diffusion plants beginning in 1980. In addition,

the strategy implies a continual transition toward an industry based upon an enrichment

process capable of operating at an average tails composition of 0,0005.

The effect of applying the improving tails strategy to a nuclear system based on the
throwaway cycle is to increase the maximum installed nuclear capacity by approximately 60 GWe
and to delay the maximum by approximately five years (see Fig. 6.2-9). Mining the tails
stockpile accumulated prior to 2010 does not significantly change the result, The reason
that mining the past tails stockpile does not produce a significantly larger nuclear contri-
bution is explained by Fig, b.2-11, which shows the cumulative amount of U30g processed
through the enrichment plants as a function of time. The amount is considerably less than
the amount of U;0g conmitted at any given time, as shown in Fig. 6.2-6. It is important to
note that the amount of U;04 actually processed through the enrichment plants prior to 1990
is relatively small, and at this time the tails composition for the improving tails strategy
has been decreasing linearly for 10 yr. Thus, most of the U30g in the improving tails case
is processed at lower tails compositions, and mining the past stockpile does not produce a
significant improvement. The most dramatic effect associated with the improving tails option
is the increase in the maximum annual enrichment requirement. As indicated in Fig. 6.2-9,
the maximum annual U;0g requirement for this option is 67,000 ST/yr, while the maximum
annual enrichment requirement is 92 million SWU/yr. Thus, the principal limitation in this
case would be the availability of enrichment capacity.

The utilization and movement of fissile material per GWe of installed capacity in
the year 2035 for each of the converter options is shown in Fig. 6.2-12a-d, assuming the
high-cost U30g supply. These figures represent a snapshot of the system in time and include
the first core loadings for units starting up in the year 2036. As can be seen, the U;0g4 con-
sumption for Case IL in the year 2035 is approximately 142 ST U30g/GWe, with the LWRs having
an extended discharge exposure comprising 92% of the installed capacity. When the LWRs are
followed by SSCRs (Case 1S), the annual U;0g consumption is 135 ST U30g, with the SSCR com-
prising 74% of the installed capacity. The fractional installed capacity of the SSCR is less

than that of the extended-exposure LWR in Case IL because the extended-exposure LWR is intro-

duced in 1981 while the SSCR is not introduced until 1991. In general, the fractional installed
capacity of a reactor concept in the year 2035 will decrease monotonically as the intro-

duction date for the concept increases. - Similarly, the fractional installed nuclear

capacity of a reactor concept will increase monotonically as its U,0g requirement decreases.

When the LWRs are followed by HTGRs (Ease 1G), the U30g consumption in the year 2035
is 133 ST U304/GWe, with the HTGR comprising 54% of the installed capacity. The annual U;04
consumption is lower than in Case 1S because the U30g requirement of the HTGR is less than
that of the SSCR (see Table 6.1-2 and Fig. 6.2-1). The fractional installed capacity of the
HTGR is less than that of the SSCR in the Case 1S because the SSCR is introduced in 1991
while the HTGR is not introduced until 1995,

When HWRs follow the LWRs (Case 1H), U30g consumption in year 2035 is approximately
106 ST U40g/GWe and the HWR comprises 79% of the installed capacity. The HWR in this case
and the HTGR in Case 1G have the same introduction date. The HWR, however, has a lower
U30g requirement and hence the total installed nuclear capacity is greater with this

reactor, Since this increase is due simply to the construction of additional HWRs, the
fractional installed capacity of the HWR is increased commensurately.

In summary, using the assumptions contained in this study, the following conclusions
can be drawn about the behavior of a nuclear power system operating on the throwaway option:

(1) The effect of deploying an advanced converter in 1995, under the assumption of
350 GWe in the year 2000 and 15 GWe/yr thereafter with the high-cost U30g supply, would
be small. 0

(2) If the U30g supply available below $160/1b should be larger than 3 million ST,
or if the nuclear growth should be smaller than assumed above, then the effect of deploying

the advanced converter would be larger.

(3) The effect of reducing the enrichment tails composition is somewhat larger than

‘that of deploying an advanced converter under the assumed conditions.

(4) The dominant variable for the nuclear power system on the throwaway cycle is
the U30g supply; a U30g supply either twice as large or twice as small is of greater
consequence than any of the effects discussed above.

6.2.2. Converter System with Plutonium Recycle

In order to assess the option of plutonium recycle in converters it was assumed that
a reprocessing capability would be available in 1991. (This assumption does not argue that
the reprocessing capacity would be economically attractive or diversion-resistant, but

merely that it would be technologically feasible by this date.) In this option the classi-

cal plutonium recycle was modified somewhat by rejecting converters with self-generated
recycle in favor of converters with complete plutonium loads. This has the advantage of

reducing the number of reactors that must be placed in the energy centers and commensurate-

ly increases the number of reactors that can be placed outside the centers. The individual
reactor concepts and their locations are shown in Fig. 6.1-2 (Option 2).

A comparison of the nuclear contribution of the LWR with plutonium recycle to that
of the LWR on the throwaway cycle (Fig. 6.2-13) shows that with recycle the maximum in-
stalled nuclear capacity is increased from approximately 420 GWe to approximately 600 GWe
and the time at which the maximum occurs is increased from about year 2010 to about year

2020 (high-cost U30g supply). The maximum annual U30g requirement for this case is
67,000 ST/yr and the maximum annual enrichment requirement is 46 million SWU/yr. These

two curves indicating the nuclear capacity that can be made available outside the centers.
The maximum capacity which must be located in the energy centers is approximately 260 GWe,
while a maximum of 400 GWe can be available outside the center. For approximately three
decades (from the year 2000 to the year 2030), over 300 GWe can be available outside the
centers. The use of plutonium ‘recycle to allow the nuclear system to grow beyond the
400-GWe level as the U30g supply becomes scarce is vividly illustrated in Fig. 6.2- 14.
Note that the number of units loaded with plutonium increases significantly as the in-
stalled capacity exceeds the 400- -Ghe- level and that they ‘comprise an increasing fraction
of the total installed capacity in later years.

Cost U30g supply) (Year 2035).

The effect of the intermediate-cost U30g supply on the LWR plutonium recycle case
is shown in Fig. 6.2-15. With 6.0 million ST U30g below $160/1b, the maximum nuclear
contribution would increase from approximately 600 GWe in the year 2020 to approximately
960 GWe in the year 2045. Thus, the U30g supply is again the dominant variable. The
maximum annual U30g requirement would be 110,000 ST/yr and the maximum annual enrichment
requirement would be 72 million SWU/yr. These annual requirements would constitute the
principal limitation of the system.

The utilization and movement of fissile material per GWe of installed capacity for
the LWR with plutonium recycle is shown in Fig. 6.2-16. Again this figure represents a
snapshot of the system in time (in the year 2035) and includes both the first core loading
for those reactors that are starting up and the last core discharge for those reactors that
are shutting down. The annual U30g consumption in 2035 is 59 ST U30g/GWe, and the LWR
utilizing plutonium comprises 54% of the installed capacity. Approximately 368 kg of
fissile plutonium in fresh fuel per GWe of installed capacity per year must be handled
within the energy centers for this case. (Note: Simply identifying the amount of
fissile plutonium in fresh fuel that must be handled is not analogous to determining the
diversion resistance of the system. While the amount of fissile plutonium being handled
may be important, the state and location of the fissile plutonium and the procedures used
to handle it are more important in assessing the diversion resistance of a system.)

In summary, a converter strategy based on LWRs with plutonium recycle could supply
a maximum nuclear contribution of 600 GWe with a U30g supply of 3.0 million ST at below
$160/1b. This is 180 GWe more than the maximum nuclear contribution obtained with the LWR
on the throwaway cycle; however, it is less than the maximum nuclear contribution of
730 GWe obtainable on the throwaway cycle with a U30g supply of 6.0 million ST at below
$160/1b. Also, converter strategy based on LWRs with plutonium recycle will require that
as much as 260 GWe be located in the energy centers.

6.2.3. Converter System with Plutonium Throwaway

Under Option 4 (see Fig. 6.1-3) it is assumed that the nuclear policy is to defer use
of plutonium until some indefinite future date and to operate all converters on low-enriched
or denatured uranium. The activities in the energy center are thus limited to reprocessing,
uranium fuel fabrication, and plutonium storage. As shown in Fig. 6.2-17, with the high-
cost U30g supply, the nuclear contribution in this case reaches a maximum of approxi-
mately 590 GWe in about 2020, which is a significant increase over that of the (U+Pu) throwaway
case, and, in fact, is quite comparable to the maximum nuclear capacity obtained with
plutonium recycle. However, the reactors employed minimize the production of plutonium and
therefore the amount ultimately thrown away. This, coupled with the fact that 233U is worth
slightly more than 23%u in a thermal reactor, allowed the system with plotonium throwaway to
ultimately achieve the same nuclear contribution as the system with plutonium recycle.

The maximum annual U30g and enrichment requirements were found to be 80,000 ST/yr and
69 million SWU/yr. This ore requirement is 20% greater than that for the case of LWR plutonium
recycle, and the enrichment requirement is 50% greater. The increases can be directly at-
tributed to the U30g and enrichment requirements of the denatured LWR loaded with 15% 2350 in
238y, As illustrated in Table 6.1-2, the lifetime U,05 and enrichment requirements of this
reactor are 24% and 64% greater than the same requirements for the standard LWR.

The effect of the intermediate-cost U30g supply for this case is shown in Fig.
6.2-18. The maximum nuclear contribution increases from approximately 590 GWe in about
year 2020 to approximately 980 GWe in about year 2045. Again the contribution of the
system is comparable to that of the LWR plutonium recycle case, and again the maximum
annual U;0g and enrichment requirements, 105,000 ST/yr and 100 million SWU/yr, respec-
tively, will represent the principal limitations of the system.

The utilization and movement of fissile material per GWe of installed capacity for
Case 4L in the year 2035 are shown in Fig. 6.2-19. The U30g5 consumption, including the
first core loadings and last discharges, is 32 ST U30g/Gle. The standard LWR loaded with
approximately 3% enriched 2350 comprises 5% of the installed nuclear capacity, the denatured
LWR loaded with 15% enriched 235U comprises 39%, and the denatured LWR loaded with 11% 233U in

238) comprises 57%. The principal advantage associated with this option is that all nuclear
units can be located outside the energy centers, which means that the amount of fissile plu-
tonium in fresh fuel that must be handled in this system is zero. This advantage is not
without cost, however; it requires the development of an industry capable of reprocessing
significant quantities of fuel containing thorium and refabricating significant quantities

of fuel containing 232(, In order to successfully implement this option, one must develop a
nuclear industry in which approximately 95% of the reprocessing capacity in the year 2035 is
capable of handling fuel containing thorium and 57% of the fabrication capacity is capable of
handling fuel containing 232U,

In summary, if employed judiciously, a converter strategy based on the LWR can be
developed which can discard all fissile plutonium and still supply a maximum nuclear con-
tribution of 590 GWe with a U40g supply of 3.0 million ST below $160/1b. This is essen-
tially identical to that of the classical LWR plutonium recycle with the same U30g supply.
With a U30g supply of 6.0 million ST below $160/1b, the system could supply a maximum

nuclear contribution of 980 GWe; however, as pointed out above, considerable development
work would be required on fuel design and fabrication.

6.2.4. Converter System with Plutonium Production Minimized;
Pu-to0-233U "Transmutation”
v

An inherent disadvantage in the plutonium throwaway option discussed above is that the
fissile plutonium produced in the system is never utilized. Therefore, it was considered de-
sirable to analyze an option in which fissile plutonium produced in a similar system is used to
produce 233U for the dispersed reactors. The 233 producer would be a converter with a
plutonium-thorium core. This converter would, of course, be located in an energy center,
while the other reactors would be located outside the center as shown in Fig. 6.1-3
{Option 5U). It is important to note that while this option utilizes all the plutoniun pro-
duced in the system, it minimizes the amount of plutonium that is produced. This requires
the development of reactor concepts designed specifically to minimize plutonium production.

The nuclear contribution of this option utilizing LWRs only (Case 5UL) reaches a
maximum of approximately 700 GWe shortly before year 2030 (see Fig. 6.2-20). Thus,
utilizing the plutonium produced in the system increases the maximum nuclear contribution
by approximately 100 GWe over that of the option with plutonium throwaway; it also
produces a delay in the maximum of about eight years (compare with Fig. 6.2-17). The
maximum annual Us0g and enrichment requirements for this option are 75,000 ST/yr and 65
million SWU/yr, respectively, each being approximately 6% less than that required for
Option 4.

The amount of the system's installed nuclear capacity that must be located in the energy
center is shown in Fig. 6.2-21 as a function of time. This option is distinguished by the
fact that the maximum capacity that must be located in a secure region does not exceed 100
GWe at any time during the planning horizon. The amount that may be located outside the
 

 

6-36

energy center ranges from approximately 300 GWe in the year 2000 to approximately 600 GWe
in the year 2025. The disadvantage of this option is that the high energy support ratio
(the amount of capacity that can be located outside the energy center divided by the amount

that must be located in the center) cannot be maintained indefinitely.

In fact, the energy

support ratio decreases continuously as the end of the U30g supply is approached.

Contribution of Adding Advanced Converters
Operating with Plutonium Minimization and

The high energy support ratio could be maintained for a longer period of time, however,

if the U30g supply were larger. Figure 6.2-22 shows that doubling the U30g supply would
increase the maximum nuclear contribution of the system from approximately 700 GWe in year

2039 to over 1000 GWe in year 2050.

Since the maximum energy support ratio occurs at about

the same time as the maximum nuclear contribution, it can be assumed that with the increased
Ug supply a large energy support ratio could be maintained as far into the future as year
2050. Given the U30g supply, it would appear that the principal limitation for this option
would be the maximum annual U;0g and enrichment requirements, which are 115,000 ST/yr and

90 million SWU/yr, respectively.

The effect upon the nuclear contribution of adding advanced converters with the LWRs

Minimizing the Production and Use of Plutonium (Case 5UL, High-Cost U30g Supply) (Year
2035).

the throwaway option for this ore supply is primarily due to the fact that reprocessing is
available in this case. The availability of reprocessing effectively increases the amount
of U30g available after the advanced converters are introduced and therefore increases the
amount of U30g upon which the advanced converters can employ their resource savings.

The utilization and movement in year 2035 of fissile material per GWe of installed
capacity for the system utilizing LWRs only (Case 5UL) is shown in Fig. 6.2-24.% The annual
U40g consumption is approximately 36 ST Ui0g/GWe. The LWR transmuting plutonium to 233y
is supplied with approximately 170 kg of fissile plutonium in fresh fuel per GWe of installed
capacity and it comprises 13% of the installed capacity. This can be compared to the
classical case of plutonium recycle in which approximately 54% of the installed capacity must

~ *The movement of fissile material in all cases is a function of time. Furthermore, it is

affected by first-core charges and last-core discharges {which are included in Fig. 6.2-24
and subsequent similar figures). The fissile balance for a decaying (or growing) system
differs significantly from that of a static system.

be Tocated in energy centers and 368 kg of fissile plutonium in fresh fuel per GWe of install-
ed capacity must be handled each year in those centers. This is not meant to imply that a
decrease in the amount of nuclear capacity which must be placed in secure regions is
synonymous with an increase in diversion-resistance. Neither is jt meant to imply that a
decrease in the amount of fissile plutonium which must be handled as fresh fuel is synonymous
with an increase in proliferation resistance. If either of these items is desirable, however,
this option minimizing the production and use of plutonium does offer a significant increase
in the energy support ratio and a significant decrease in the amount of fresh-fuel plutonium

that must be handled.

It is important to note that the deployment of the plutonium minimization and
utilization option would require the development of a nuclear industry capable of reprocessing
fuel containing thorium and refabricating fuel containing 232U. As Fig. 6.2-24 indicates,
only one reactor providing 3% of the installed capacity in year 2035 does not utilize thorium.
Thus, in order to successfully implement this option, 97% of the reprocessing capacity in
year 2035 must be capable of handling fuel containing thorium, and 51% of the fabrication
capacity must be capable of handling fuel containing 232.

In summary, a converter strategy based on the LWR which minimizes the amount of
plutonium produced, but uses that which is produced, could supply a maximum nuclear con-
tribution of 700 GWe with the high-cost U30g supply. This is approximately 100 GWe
greater than the maximum nuclear contribution obtained in the case of plutonium throwaway
and fissile uranium recycle. The strategy does, however, require that approximately
100 GWe be located in an energy center. With the intermediate-cost U30g supply, the system
could make a maximum nuclear contribution of more than 1000 GWe. In either case, the
development of fuel designs capable of minimizing the amount of plutonium produced and also
the development of a nuclear industry capable of handling thorium-based fuels must be developed.

6.2.5. Converter System with Plutonium Production Not
Minimized; Pu-to-233U "Transmutation"

This option differs from the preceding option in that the dispersed reactors are not
designed to minimize the amount of plutonium produced. Thus more plutonium is handled as
fresh fuel and more is "transmuted" into 233y. Again a converter with a plutonium-thorium
core is located in the energy center, and other reactors are located outside the center (see
Fig. 6,1-3, Option 5T).

Figure 6.2-25 shows that the nuclear contribution for this option using LWRs only
(Case 5TL) reaches a maximum of approximately 640 GWe shortly before year 2025. The maximum
contribution is less than the 700-GWe maximum in the preceding case primarily because of the
different amounts of fissile plutonium utilized in the two systems. Since 23%u is worth less
in a thermal reactor than either 235 or 233, the system which minimizes the amount of plu-
tonium should (and does) make a slightly larger nuclear contribution.

The fraction of the installed nuclear capacity which for this case must be located
in energy centers is shown in Fig. 6.2-26 as a function of time. The maximum is approximately
120 GWe, which is slightly greater than that for the previous case. The amount of nuclear
capacity available for location outside energy centers ranges from approximately 300 GWe in
the year 2000 to approximately 500 GWe in the year 2025. The maximum annual U;04 and enrich-
ment requirements are 65,000 ST/yr and 45 million SWU/yr, respectively. These are quite similar
to the maximum annual requirements for the case of the LWR with classical plutonium recycle

{see Fig. 6.2-13).

The disadvantage of this option is that the energy support ratio decreases continu-
ously as the end of the U30g supply is approached. Figure 6.2-27 indicates that if a U30g

supply of 6.0 million ST below $160/1b were available, the system would continue to grow

high energy support ratio associated with
this option could be maintained much longer.

. The maximum annual U30g and enrichment

requirements in this case are 109,000 ST/yr
and 77 million SWU/yr, respectively. Thus,
again we have an option for which the

installed capacity must be handled as fresh fuel each year within the energy centers. This
can be compared to the classical case of plutonium recycle in which 56% of the installed
capacity is located in the energy centers and 368 kg of fissile plutonium is handled as fresh

. fuel each year. Thus, using the plutonium to produce 233U results in a significant reduction

in the amount of installed capacity that must be located in secure regions, and it also reduces
the amount of fissile plutonium that must be handled as fresh fuel each year.

Fig. 6.2-28. Utilization and Movement of Fissile Material in an LWR Nuclear System
"Transmuting" Plutonium to 233U (Case 5TL, High-Cost U30g Supply) (Year 2035).

As for the preceding option, the high energy support ratio associated with this case
requires the development of a nuclear industry capable of reprocessing significant amounts
of fuel containing thorium and refabricating significant amounts of fuel containing 232,
although these amounts are considerably smaller, As Fig. 6.2-28 indicates, the LWR loaded
with approximately 3% enriched 2350 comprises 62% of the installed capacity in year 2035,
the LWR loaded with Pu in Th comprises 18%, and the LWR loaded with 12% 233U in 238U comprises
20%. - Thus approximately 34% of the reprocessing capacity must be capable of handling fuel
containing thorium and 20% of the fabrication capacity must be capable of handling fuel con-

taining 232y,

In summary, a converter strategy based on the LWR which "transmutes" all plutonium
to 233U could supply a maximum nuclear contribution of 640 GWe with the high-cost U30g
supply, of which about 120 GWe would be located in energy centers. While the nuclear con-
tribution for this case is somewhat less than for the case in which the production of
plutonium is minimized, it does not require the development of new reactor concepts and
it will require handling smaller amounts of 233y.

6.2.6 Converter-Breeder System with Light Plutonium "Transmutation

The results presented in the preceding sections have demonstrated that nuclear
power systems based on converter reactors will ultimately be limited by the quantity of
economically recoverable uranium. While a larger U;0g resource base will allow larger
systems to develop, the converse is also true. Since the U30g resource base has always
been somewhat uncertain, the deployment of fast breeder reactors has traditionally been
considered as the method by which the consequences of this uncertainty would be minimized.
Thus, it has historically been assumed that by deploying FBRs nuclear power systems would
outgrow the constraints naturally imposed by the U30g resource base.

In the option discussed here (Option 6), an FBR with a plutonium-uranium core and a
thorium blanket is located in the energy center to produce 233U which is then used in de-
natured converter reactors outside the center. Because a higher plutonium “transmutation”
rate could be obtained with a plutonium-thorium core in the FBR, this option is referred
to as having a light "Pu-to0-233U" transmutation rate. The individual reactor concepts
contained in this option are shown in Fig. 6.1-4.

The nuclear contribution associated with this option when all the converters utilized
are LWRs (Case 6L) is shown in Fig. 6.2-29. In this case, even with the high-cost U;0g
supply, the system is capable of maintaining a net addition rate of 15 GWe/yr throughout
the planning horizon - i.e., from 1980 through 2050. The ability of the nuclear system
to maintain this net addition rate is a direct consequence of the compound system doubling
time of the FBR, which, in this case, is 13 yr. This doubling time in turn is a direct
consequence of the FBR having a Pu-U core.

In this option the installed nuclear capacity which must be located in energy centers
increases as a function of time to approximately 560 GWe in year 2050 (see Fig. 6.2-30).
The most rapid increase occurs between 2010 and 2020 as the number of FBRs on line in-
creases significantly. The amount of nuclear capacity available for installation outside
the centers increases from approximately 300 GWe in year 2000 to over 500 GWe in year 2050.
Initially, the LWR loaded with approximately 3% enriched 2350 is the principal reactor
available, but as the U30g is depleted, it is replaced by the LWR loaded with 11% 233y
in 238). This is illustrated in Fig. 6.2-31, which also indicates that this option is
capable of maintaining an energy support ratio greater than unity throughout the planning
horizon.

The maximum annual U30g and enrichment requirements for this case are 62,000 ST/yr
and 44 million SWU/yr, respectively. These annual requirements do not differ significantly
from those obtained with the LWR on the throwaway cycle, the reason being that in either
case, the goal of the nuclear power system is to maintain a net addition rate of 15 GWe/yr
provided this increase can be sustained by the U30g supply. The maximum installed capacity

for the LWR loaded with approximately 3% en-
riched 2350 in either case is approximately
420 GWe. However, in this option, as the in-
stalled capacity of the 235U-loaded LWRs
decreases, the energy center FBRs produce in-
creasing amounts of 233U for the denatured LWRs,
and thus the total installed nuclear capacity con-
tinues to increase at a net rate of 15 GWe/yr.

The amount of fissile plutonium that must
be handled in the energy centers as fresh fuel
each year is shown in Fig, 6.2-32, Approxi-
mately 620 kg of fissile plutonium per GWe must
be handled in this case, as compared to approxi~

mately 170 kg of fissile plutonium in fresh fuel per GWe each year for the case of plutonium
minimization and utilization. Thus, it appears that the ability to maintain an energy support
ratio greater than unity while simultaneously adding 15 GWe/yr will necessitate handling more
fissile plutonium in fresh fuel in the energy centers. }

As pointed out "in previous cases, the ability to maintain a high energy support ratio
requires the development of a nuclear industry capable of reprocessing fuel containing
thorium and refabricating fuel containing 232U. In this option in the year 2035, the LWR
loaded with approximately 3% enriched 235U comprises approximately 28% of the installed
capacity, the FBR comprises 48%, and the LWR loaded with 11% 233U in 238U comprises 24%.
Upon examining the flow of thorium and uranium metal associated with these reactors, it

can be seen that 38% of the reprocessing capacity must be capable of handling fuel con-
taining thorium and 27% of the fabrication industry must be capable of handling fuel

‘containing 232y,

System with a Light "Pu-to-233U" Transmutation Rate (Case 6L, High-Cost U30g Supply)
(Year 2035).

In summary, a strategy based on an FBR with a Pu-U core and a thorium blanket could
supply a net addition rate of 15 GWe/yr to the year 2050 and beyond with a U305 supply of
3 million ST below $160/1b. The installed nuclear capacity in 2050 would be 1100 GWe,
with 560 GWe, or approximately 50% of the installed capacity, located in secure energy
centers. Approximately 27% of the fabrication capacity must be capable of handling fuel
containing 232y, Thus, while a nuclear system based on an FBR with a Pu-U core and a
thorium blanket can supply 15 GWe/yr for an indefinite period of time, it simultaneously
requires that a significant amount of nuclear capacity be located in secure regions.

6.2.7. Converter-Breeder System with Heavy Plutonium "Transmutation”

The preceding discussion indicates that a nuclear power system that includes an FBR
having a Pu-U core and producing 233U in a thorium blanket can maintain an energy support
ratio greater than unity while simultaneously adding 15 GWe/yr to the installed capacity
throughout the planning horizon. The possibility exists, however, that a nuclear power
system that includes an FBR having a Pu-Th core and a thorium blanket would result in a
heavy Pu-to-233U transmutation rate which would maintain an energy support ratio signi-
ficantly greater than unity over the same period of time. The principal problem associated
with a nuclear system based on an FBR with a Pu-Th core is that the breeding ratio of the
breeder, and hence the breeding ratio of the entire system, tends to be low. Therefore,
the effect of adding to the system an FBR operating on denatured 233y to augment the 233y
production was also investigated. The individual reactor concepts contained in this.
system are shown in Fig. 6.1-4 (Option 8).

“The nuclear contribution associated with this option (Case 8L, with denatured
breeder) is compared to that of the LWR on the throwaway cycle for the high-cost U30g
supply in Fig. 6.2-33. The system is capable of maintaining a net addition rate of

15 GWe/yr throughout the planning horizon.

The installed nuclear capacity which for Case BL must be located in energy centers
is shown in Fig. 6.2-34 as a function of time. The maximum is less than 300 GWe through-
out the planning horizon. The amount available for location outside the energy centers
ranges from approximately 300 GWe in the year 2000 to approximately 800 GWe in the year
2050. This can be compared to Option 6 for which the nuclear capacity that must be
located in secure regions increases continuously to approximetely 560 GWe in 2050. Thus,
a nuclear system containing FBRs with Pu~Th cores plus FBRs with denatured 233U cores is
capable of maintaining a very high energy support ratio for an indefinite period of time.
It does require, however, that reactors that are net producers of fissile material be
located in energy centers.

The utilization and movement of fissile material in year 2035 for Case 8L and the
small U30g supply are shown in Fig. 6.2-35. The LWR loaded with approximately 3% enriched
235 comprises approximately 13% of the installed capacity, the denatured 235U LWR comprises
approximately 12%, the energy center FBR comprises approximately 29%, the denatured 233U LWR
comprises 8%, and the denatured FBR comprises 38%. The denatured 235U LWR is being rapidly
phases out of the nuclear system in year 2035, while the denatured 233U LWR is being
rapidly phased in. This is indicated in Fig. 6.2-35 by the fact that the heavy metal dis-
charge for the denatured 2350 LWR is considerably greater than the heavy metal charge,
while the heavy metal charge for the denatured 233U LWR is considerably greater than the
heavy metal discharge. The former is indicative of final core discharges, while the latter
is indicative of first core loadings.

In this option the annual consumption of U30g is approximately 25 ST U30g in year
2035, decreasing thereafter as the LWRs loaded with 2350 are replaced by the LWRs loaded
with 233y, Approximately 430 kg of fissile plutonium per GWe of installed capacity must
be handled as fresh fuel each year within energy centers, somewhat less than the 620 kg
that must be handled in Option 6. The ability to maintain a high energy support ratio
while simultaneously adding 15 GWe/yr again requires the development of a nuclear industry
capable of reprocessing fuel containing thorium and refabricating fuel containing 232y.
Figure 6.2-35 shows that 65% of the reprocessing capacity in year 2025 must be capable of
handling fuel containing thorium and that 31% of the refabrication capacity must be capable
of handling fuel containing 232y,

The effect of deleting the denatured FBR from the system is shown in Figs. 6.2-36 and
6.2-37. Figure 6.2-36 shows that without the denatured FBR the installed nuclear capacity
reaches a maximum of approximately 840 GWe in about 2035 and declines continuously there-
after. The reason for this, of course, is that without the denatured FBR the system has
a net breeding ratio of less than unity. Therefore, while the system can multiply the
fissile supply significantly, it cannot continue to grow indefinitely. The nuclear capacity
that must be located in energy centers for the modified Case 8L is shown in Fig. 6.2-37.
This capacity does not exceed 140 GWe throughout the planning horizon. The amount of
capacity available for location outside the secure regions ranges from approximately
300 GWe in the year 2000 to approximately 700 GWe in year 2035.

In summary, a strategy based on an FBR with a Pu-Th core and a thorium blanket can
supply a net addition rate of 15 GWe/yr to year 2050 and beyond provided a denatured breeder
is included in the system. If the denatured breeder is not included, then the maximum
nuclear contribution would be approximately 840 GWe. ~The amount of nuclear capacity that
must be located in secure regions does not exceed 140 GWe in this case.

6.3. CONCLUSIONS

The principal conclusions developed during the course of this study are summarized
in Tables 6.3-1, 6.3-2, and 6.3.3.

From the preceding discussion and Table 6.3-1, the following conclusions are drawn
for various nuclear systems operating on the throwaway cycle:

(1) With a U40g supply of 3.0 million ST below $160/1b, the maximum installed
capacity with the standard LWR on the throwaway cycle would be approximately 420 GWe,
and this would occur in about year 2006.

(2) A reduction in the U0 requirement of all LWRs commencing operation in 1981 and
thereafter by 6% would not significantly increase the maximum installed capacity. Thus, for
the case of the LWR on the throwaway cycle, the effort should be on improvements in U30g util-

ization significantly greater than 6% for LWRs commencing operation after 1981 or on improve-
ments which can be retrofitted into existing LWRs.

(5) The effect of an exploration program successful enough to reliably increase
the U304 resource base to 6.0 million ST below $160/1b would be considerably greater than
any of the above. Thus, when analyzing the throwaway option, the size of the U;04 resource
base and the uncertainty associated with it dominate the analysis.

From the discussion in Section 6.2 and Tables 6.3-2 and 6.3-3, the following conclu-
sions are drawn for LWR and LWR-FBR systems operating with recycle:

(1) With the high-cost Us0g supply, the effect of plutonium recycle in LWRs would
be to increase the installed nuclear capacity to 600 GWe, and this would occur in about
year 2020. This would require, however, that as much as 40% of the nuclear capacity be
located in the energy centers. If the U30g supply should be as large as 6.0 million ST

below $160/1b, the maximum installed nuclear capacity would be 960 GWe, and this would
occur in about year 2045.

(2) If all plutonium were thrown away but fissile uranium were refabricated and
reloaded, the maximum installed nuclear capacity could be as large as 590 GWe with the
high-cost U;0g supply. Attaining 590 GWe, however, requires the development of fuel
designs which minimize the amount of plutonium produced. - In addition, it requires the
development of an industry ‘in which as much as 95% of the reprocessing capacity is devoted
to fuel containing thorium and as much as 57% of the refabrication capacity is devoted to
fuel containing 232y,

(3) If the plutonium produced in the system described immediately above were re-
fabricated and reloaded, the maximum installed nuclear capacity would increase to approxi-
mately 700 GWe, which is an increase in the maximum of approximately 110 GWe.

 
 

 

6-50

(4) If all plutonium produced were transmuted to 233U but no attempt was made to
minimize the amount of plutonium produced, the maximum installed nuclear capacity could be
as large as 640 GWe with the high-cost U30g supply. As much as 21% of the installed
nuclear capacity would have to be located in secure energy centers, however, and it would
require that 34% of the reprocessing capacity be devoted to fuel containing thorium and 20%
of the refabrication capacity be devoted to fuel containing 233u,

(5) If a nuclear system utilizing an FBR with a Pu-U core and a thorium blanket were
developed, the system could maintain a net addition rate of 15 GWe/yr indefinitely. The
installed nuclear capacity, in this case, could be as high as 1100 GWe in year 2050; however,
56% of this capacity would have to be located in secure energy centers. Aliso, approximately
38% of the reprocessing capacity would have to be devoted to fuel containing thorium and 27%
of the refabrication capacity would have to be devoted to fuel containing 232U.

(6) If a nuclear system utilizing an FBR with a Pu-Th core and a thorium blanket were
developed, the maximum installed capacity would depend upon the performance characteristics
of the denatured design receiving fuel from the FBR. If this design were a denatured breeder,
the nuclear system would be capable of adding 15 GWe/yr indefinitely. If, however, the
design were a denatured LHR, then the installed nuclear capacity would increase to approxi-
mately 850 GWe in about year 2035 and decrease thereafter.

In addition to the results and conclusions presented in this chapter, detailed results
for all the nuclear policy options calculated are tabulated in Appendix C. Also, as men-
tioned earlier, a separate analysis performed under the assumption of an unlimited U30g
supply but with the nuclear power systems in competition with coal-fired plants is described
in Appendix D.

7.0. INTRODUCTION

T. J. Burns
Oak Ridge National Laboratory

The assessment of any proposed fuel cycle must of necessity consider various topics
that affect the feasibility and viability of the particular cycle. Moreover, an assessment
of a particular fuel cycle must consider the relative merits of the fuel cycle compared to
other potentially available fuel cycle options. This study of the denatured 233U fuel cycle
has addressed various aspects of the cycle in the preceding chapters: the proliferation-
resistant characteristics of the cycle (in Chapter 3); the impact of denatured 233U fuel on
the performance of several types of reactors (in Chapter 4); the implementation and com-
mercialization aspects of the denatured fuel cycle (in Chapter 5); and the economic/resource
implications of the cycle {in Chapter 6). In each of these chapters, the assessment of the
denatured 233U cycle was limited primarily to the specific aspect under consideration. In
this chapter the detailed results of the assessment are summarized and integrated, and the
potential tradeoffs possible between the various considerations are addressed. In addition,
recommendations for further study of crucial aspects of the denatured 233U fuel cycle are
made.

7.1. PROLIFERATION-RESISTANT CHARACTERISTICS OF DENATURED 233U FUEL
C. M. Newstead

"and

T. J. Burns
Oak Ridge National Laboratory

- As has been stated in earlier chapters, the primary goal of the denatured fuel cycle
is to permit the recycle of fissile fuels in dispersed reactors in a manner consistent with
nonproliferation considerations. In this section the proliferation-resistant character-
istics of the denatured 23%: fuel cycle that have been described in detail in Chapter 3
are summarized, and their significance with respect to both national proliferation and
subnational terrorism is noted. In general, these characteristics derive from three

- distinguishing features of the denatured fuel cycle: (1) the intrinsic. isotopic barrier

of the fresh denatured fuel, (2) the gamma radiation barrier associated with the 232y
impurity present in thorium-derived fuel, and (3) the low chemically separable fissile
content of the spent denatured fuel.

7.1.1. Isotopic Barrier of Fresh Fuel

The isotopic barrier of the fresh fuel is created by the addition of the 238y
denaturant to the 233 fissile fuel, its purpose being to preclude the use of the 233
directly in a nuclear weapons program. Although the thorium present in most proposed
denatured fuels could be chemically removed, the separated uranium would have too low a
fissile content for it to be directly usable in a practical nuclear device. By contrast,
the other potential fuel cycle relying on recycled material, the Pu/U cycle, would require
only a chemical separation to extract weapons-usable material directly from power reactor
fuel. The isotopic barrier in denatured fuel is not an absolute barrier, however, since
any isotope separation (i.e., enrichment) technique can be used to circumvent it.
Depending upon its technological resources, a nation may have or may develop separation
facilities. On the other hand, it is unlikely that a subnational group would possess
isotopic separation capabilities and thus the isotopic barrier inherent in denatured fuel
would provide considerable protection against terrorist nuclear activities.

As is pointed out in Section 3.3.4 and Appendix A, enrichment technology has made
great strides in recent years and is presently undergoing rapid further development. Ten
years ago the only operational enrichment facilities were based on the gaseous diffusion
technique, a method requiring a large expenditure of energy and a large plant to be
economic. Today the gas centrifugation technique, which requires a significantly Tower
energy consumption than the gaseous diffusion method, is available and is practical with
small-scale plants. For example, the URENCO consortium is currently operating centri-
fuge enrichment plants of 50 tonnes per year capacity at Capenhurst in the United
Kingdom and at Almelo in The Netherlands. The URENCO centrifuge represents an economic
design built by technologically advanced countries (England, The Netherlands, Germany)

without benefit of U.S. experience. For a military program, economics would not be an
overriding criterion and could be sacrificed in favor of a more moderate level of
technology. Moreover, the open literature contains sufficient information concerning the
centrifuge designs to guide mechanically competent engineers with access to adequate
facilities. Replication of an economic design would require a somewhat higher level of
technology than prototype construction.

The following particular points regarding the enrichment of denatured 233y fuel
should be noted:

(1) Because of the lower mass of 233, separating 233 from 238y would require only 9/25
of the effort required to separate 235U from 238U, assuming equal feed enrichments.

(2) Since the fast critical mass of 23% is less than that of 235U, less enrichment
capacity would be required to produce a 233 weapon from 233y/238y feed than would
be required to produce a 235U weapon from 2350/238y feed, again assuming equal
enrichments of the feed material.

(3) The higher the enrichment of the source material, the less separative work that would
have to be done to upgrade the material to 90% enrichment. For example, enriching
natural uranium to a 10% level consumes 90% of the separative work required to
achieve a 90% level. It is to be noted that the enrichment of denatured 233 fuel
js approximately 12%, whereas the enrichment of currently used LWR 235U fuel is
around 3-4%.

With respect to items (2) and (3), a rough comparison can be made of the feed
requirements and the number of centrifuges that would be necessary to produce 90% enriched

material from various fuels in one year (normalized to 1 kg of product):

The above values do not consider measures to eliminate the 232 contamination and they
assume that a reasonable tails assay will be maintained (~0,2% 2354). If a higher tails
assay were acceptable, the number of centrifuges could be reduced but the feed material
required would be increased.

One year, of course, is a long time when compared to a period of weeks that would
be needed to obtain approximately 10 kg of plutonium by chemically reprocessing two to
three spent LWR-LEU fuel elements. It would be possible to speed up the process time for
the centrifuge method either by increasing the individual machine capacity, by adding
additional centrifuges, or by operating at a higher tails assay. Increasing the capacity

would be quite difficult and would require increasing technological sophistication; how-
ever, adding centrifuges would require only that the same device be duplicated as many
times as necessary. Increasing the tails assay would require more feed material.

Finally, in considering the potential circumvention of the isotopic barrier, it is
important to anticipate the enrichment technologies that could exist in 20 to 25 years -
the time when the denatured fuel cycle could be deployed. Technologically advanced
countries already have the necessary technological base to design and construct centri-
fuges, and many presently developing countries may have acquired the technology base by
that time. Countries with a primitive technology are unlikely to use this route, since
even with the financial assets and technically competent personnel they would have the
difficult task of developing the requisite support facilities. Other potential isotope
separation techniques are under development in many countries. Laser isotope separation
(LIS), plasma techniques, aerodynamic methods, chemical techniques, and electromagnetic
separation methods currently show varying degrees of promise. The current status of
these methods is discussed in Appendix A. It is impossible to predict the ultimate
success or failure of these alternative methods, and hence the isotopic separation
capability which might exist in 25 years is even more difficult to estimate. Current
estimates for the U.S. development program in LIS and plasma methods suggest that it will
be at least ten years before such methods could be operative on a working industrial
basis, even with a highly sophisticated R&D effort.

7.1.2. Gamma-Radiation Barrier of Fresh Fuel

The production of 233U results in the concomitant production of a small but radio-
actively significant quantity of 232 through the 232Th(n,2n) reaction [and the 230Th(n,y)

"reaction if 230Th is present in the thorium]. As the 232U decays through 228Th and its

daughter products, the gamma activity of the 233y-containing fuels increases, thus providing

a radiation barrier much more intense than is found in other fresh fuels. While chemical processing
could be employed to remove the 232U decay products, such a procedure would provide a relatively

low radioactivity for only 10-20 days, since further decay of the 232U present in the fuel

would provide a new population of 228Th and its daughters, the activity of which would con-

tinue to increase in intensity for several years.

The concentration of 232U in the recycle fuel is usually characterized as so many
parts per million (ppm) of 232U in total uranium. Due to the threshold nature of the
232Th(n,2n) reaction, the 232 concentration varies with the neutron spectrum of the
reactor in which it is produced. It also varies with the amount of recycle. For 12%
233 denatured fuel, the 232U concentration {in ppm U) ranges from 250 ppm for LWR-
produced 233U to a maximum of 1600 ppm for certain LMFBR-derived denatured fuels (see
Section 3.1.3). If the latter material were enriched to produce weapons-grade material,
the 2320 concentration would be approximately 8000 ppm, and thus the material would be

highly radioactive.

While the radiation field would introduce complications in the manufacture of a
weapon, particularly for a terrorist group, the resulting dose rates would not provide an
absolute barrier (see Section 3.3.5). As mentioned above, it would be possible to clean
up the fissile material so that it was relatively free of radiation for a period of 10 to
20 days. Alternatively, providing shielding and remote handling would allow the radiation
barrier to be circumvented; however, construction and/or acquisition of the shielding,
remote handling equipment, etc., could increase the risk of detection of a covert pro-
gram before its completion. Non-fissile material included in the weapon would also
provide some shielding during delivery, and additional shadow shielding to protect the
operator of the delivery vehicle and to facilitate the loading operations could be
developed.

In another approach, the 2320 could be separated from the 233U by investing in a
rather large cascade of over some 3000 centrifuges, possibly including 228Th cleanup to limit
the radiation contamination of the centrifuges. A willingness to accept certain operational
disadvantages would permit the radiation-contaminated material to be processed in the cen-
trifuges provided they were shielded and some provision was made for remote operation. By
comparison, clean mixed oxide Pu/U fuel would have a much less significant radiation problem
and the currently employed fresh LEU fuel would have essentially none at all.

7.1.3. Spent Fuel Fissile Content

Spent denatured fuel contains three possible sources of fissile material: unburned
233; 23%a which decays to 233; and Pu produced from the 238 denaturant. Use of the
uranium contained in the spent denatured fuel is subject to all the considerations out-
Tined above and would also be hindered by the fission-product contamination (and resultant
radiation) inherent in spent reactor fuel. As was noted in Section 3.3.4, the relatively
Tong half-life of 233pa (27.4 days) could permit the production of weapons-grade material
via chemical separation of the 23%a; however, such a procedure would require that
chemical separation be initiated shortly upon discharge from the reactor (while radiation
levels are very high) to minimize the amount of 233Pa which decays to 233 while still
contained in the 238U denaturant. Moreover, since the discharge concentration of 233Pa is
typically 5% of that of 233y, a considerable heavy metal processing rate would be required
to recover a significant quantity of 23%a (and hence 23%) within the time frame avail-
able. The plutonium concentration is comparable to that of 23%a, but very little is lost
by decay. Hence, the spent fuel: can be allowed to cool for some time before reprocessing.
It would seem, therefore, that if denatured 233U spent fuel were diverted it would be
primarily for its plutonium content.

Any fuel cycle utilizing 238U inevitably leads to some plutonium production.
Compared to the LEU cycle and the Pu/U cycle, the denatured 233 fuel cycle reduces the
plutonium production by (1) employing as little 238U as necessary to achieve the
denaturing objective, and (2) replacing the displaced 238) with 232Th to enhance the

production of "denaturable" 23%. The plutonium production rates for various reactors
operating on conventional and denatured fuel cycles are discussed in Chapter 4 and
summarized in Table 7.1-1, where the Light-Water Reactor (LWR) is represented by the
pressurized-water reactor (PWR); the SSCR (Spectral-Shift-Controlled Reactor) is a
modified PWR; the heavy-water reactor (HWR) is assumed to be a slightly enriched CANDU;
the ‘High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor (HTGR) is taken to be the Fort St. Vrain plant;
and the High-Temperature Reactor (HTR) of the Pebble-Bed Reactor (PBR) type is represented
by the West German design. Plutonium discharge data for Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs)
represented by the Liquid-Metal Fast Breeder Reactor (LMFBR) are included for comparison.

It is quite clear from Table 7.1-1 that the denatured fuel cycle for the HWR gives
the greatest reduction in plutonium production between the regular and denatured cycles.
The HTGR has about the same absolute plutonium production for the denatured. fuel cycle as
the HWR and in both cases the plutonium amounts are rather small. The HTR-PBR is best in
absolute minimum plutonium production, yielding only 14 kg/GWe-yr and even less in a highly
optimized design.

For the LWR, SSCR and HWR the percentage of the discharge plutonium that is fissile
plutonium is approximately the same for the denatured cycle as for the LEU cycle. For
the HTGR and PBR, the fissile plutonium percentage is only 39% for the denatured cycle
(compared to 56% for the LEU cycle). Further, the discharge plutonium from the HTGR and PBR,
and also from the HWR, is more diluted with other heavy material by a factor of three to
four than that from the LWR or SSCR. Thus, more material must be processed in the HTGR,
HTR, and HWR to obtain a given amount of plutonium, which provides an additional prolifera-
tion restraint associated with spent fuel discharged from these reactors, However, the
on-line refueling feature of the CANDU, and also of the PBR, may be a disadvantage from a
proliferation viewpoint since low-burnup fuel could be removed and weapons-grade plutonium
extracted from it. On the other hand, premature discharge of low-burnup fuel from the
reactors would incur economic penalties.

Viewed solely from the plutonium production viewpoint, the order of preference in terms
of higher proliferation resistance for the various denatured reactor candidates to be employed
at dispersed sites is as follows: HTR-PBR, HWR, HTGR, LWR, and SSCR. However, other factors
must also be addressed in evaluating the candidate reactors, one of which is that their
plutonium production maintains the symbiosis of a system that includes plutonium-fueled 233U
producers in secure energy centers. This plutonium being consumed within the center as it is
recovered from the spent fuel would limit the amount of plutonium available for possible
diversion. While such an energy center could also be implemented for the Pu/U cycle, the
denatured cycle would permit the dispersal of a larger fraction of the recycle-based power
generation capability. Hence, the number and/or size of the required energy centers might
be markedly reduced relative to the number required by the Pu/U cycle.

7.1.4. Conclusions

The proliferation-resistant characteristics of the denatured 233U fuel cycle derive from
its intrinsic isotopic barrier, its gamma radiation barrier, and its relatively Tow content of
chemically separable fissile material in spent fuel:

e The isotopic denaturing of the denatured 2330 cycle would provide a significant
technical barrier (although not an absolute one) that would decrease with time
at a rate which is country-specific. Technologically primitive countries will
find it an imposing barrier relative to other routes. Countries that have the
technological expertise to develop isotope separation capabilities will have the
technology required to circumvent this barrier; however, they will also have the
option of utilizing possible indigeneous natural uranium or low enriched 235y fuel
as alternate feed materials.

e The denatured 233U cycle imposes a significant radiation barrier due to the 232y
daughter products in the fresh fuel as an inherent property of the cycle. Such
a radiation field increases the effort required to obtain weapons-usable material
from fresh denatured reactor fuel. : ’

e While the amount of plutonium discharged in the denatured 233 fuel cycle is

© significantly less than in either the Pu/U cycle or the LEU cycle, the presence
of plutonium in the cycle (even though it is in the spent fuel) does represent
a proliferation concern. Conversely, it also represents a resource potentially
useful in a symbiotic power system employing denatured fuel. The concept of a
safeguarded energy center provides a means of addressing this duality in that
the fissile plutonium can be burned in the center to produce a proliferation-
resistant fuel.

In summary, the denatured 233U fuel cycle offers a technical contribution to pro-
liferation resistance. However, the fuel cycle must be supplemented with political and
institutional arrangements also designed to discourage proliferation.

 
 

7.2. IMPACT OF DENATURED 233 FUEL ON REACTOR PERFORMANCE AND SELECTION:
COMPARISON WITH OTHER FUEL CYCLES

T. J. Burns
Oak Ridge National Laboratory

The discussion in Chapter 4 has shown that the impact of the denatured 233U fuel
cycle on the performance of the various reactors considered in this study is largely due
to differences in the nuclear properties of 233U and 232Th relative to those of 239Py
{and 235y) and 238y, respectively. For thermal systems, 2330 is a significantly better
fuel than either 23°Py or 235U, both in terms of energy production and in terms of the
conversion ratio* that can be attained. For fast systems, however, the substitution of
233y-based fuels for 23%Pu-based fuels results in a somewhat poorer reactor performance,
particularly with respect to the breeding ratio.* In this section the performance of the
various reactors operating on the denatured 233y fuel cycle is compared with their per-
formance on other fuel cycles. In addition, the dependence of the denatured 233y fuel
cycle on auxiliary fuel cycles for an adequate supply of 233U is discussed. Because of this
dependence, reactors fueled with denatured 233U must be operated in symbiosis with reactors
that produce 233y. These latter reactors, referred to as transmuters, may be either thermal
reactors or fast reactors. The particular reactors selected for operation as transmuters and
those chosen to operate on denatured 233U fuel will depend on several factors, two of the most
important being the resource requirements of the individual reactors and the energy growth
capability required of the symbiotic system. The influence of these various factors is
pointed out in the discussion below.

7.2.1 Thermal Reactors

In comparing the performance of thermal reactors operating on denatured 233U fuel
with their performance on other fuels, it is useful to distinguish between two generic
fuel cycle types: those that do not require concurrent reprocessing (that is, once-through
systems) and those that do. Although the denatured 233U fuel cycle cannot itself be
employed as a once-through system, the implementation of the MEU(235)/Th once-through
cycle is a logical first step to the implementation of the denatured 233U cycle. Thus both
once-through and recycle scenarios are considered here for thermal reactors.

Once-Through Systems

Two fuel cycles of interest to this study can be implemented without concurrent reprocess-
ing capability: the LEU cycle and the MEU(235)/Th cycle. The LEU cycle is, of course, already used

 

5
The conversion ratio and breeding ratio are both defined as the ratio of the rate at
which fissile material is produced to the rate at which fissile material is destroyed at a
specific point in time (for example, at the midpoint of the equilibrium cycle). The term
conversion ratio is applied to those reactors for which this ratio is less than 1, which
is usually the case for thermal reactors, while the term breeding ratio is applied to
those reactors for which this ratio is greater than 1, which is usually the case for fast
reactors (i.e., breeders).

routinely in LWRs and small-scale fabrication of MEU(235)/Th fuels for LWRs might be attain-
able within 2 ~ 3 years. However, it is pointed out that the once-through cycia has two
variants - throwaway and stowaway - and in certain systems (for example, the PWR, as noted
below), the MEU(235)/Th cycle might be economic only from a stowaway standpoint - that is,
only if a reprocessing capability is eventually envisioned.

Table 7.2-1 summarizes the Uj04 and separative work requirements estimated for PWRs
HWRs, HTEGRs, PBRs, and SSCRs operating as once-through systems on both the LEU and the
MEU(235)/Th cycles. Several interesting points are evident from these data. The LEU-HWR
requires the smallest resource commitment (as well as the smallest SWU requirement). The
conventional PWR requires a significantly greater resource commitment and larger SWU
requirements for the MEU/Th once-through cycle than for the LEU once-through cycle and
hence no incentive exists for the MEU/Th cycle on PWRs if only the throwaway option is
considered. Significantly, however, both of the gas-cooled graphite-moderated reactors, the
HTGR and the PBR, require smaller U30g commitments for the MEU/Th once-through cycle than
for the LEU case. Moreover, for both of these reactors, the SWU requirements for the MEU/Th

cycle are not significantly different from those for the LEU cycle; in fact, for the PBR,
the MEU/Th cycle is slightly less demanding than the LEU cycle. These effects are pri-

marily due to the high burnup design of both the HTGR and the PBR. At the higher burnup
levels of the gas-cooled reactors, most of the 233U produced in the MEU/Th cycle is burned in
situ and contributes significantly to both the power and the conversion ratio. It is also
interesting to note that, while not considered in Table 7.2-1, the unique design of the
PBR would permit recycle of ‘the fertile elements without intervening reprocessing and thus
would further reduce both the ore and SWU requirements for the MEU/Th cycle. [Note: The
data given in Table 7.2-1 for PWRs considers only current commercially deployed designs.
Studies now underway in the DOE-sponsored Nonproliferation Alternative Systems Assessment
Program (NASAP) indicate that LWR modifications to reduce uranium requirements are feasible.
Similarly, much of the other reactor data are subject to design refinement and uncertain-
ties, as well as to future optimization for specific roles.]

If these once-through systems are operating on. the throwaway option, the fissile
material discharged in their spent fuel elements is deemed unusable; in fact, no value is
assigned to the spent fuel in once-through fuel cycle accounting. Thus, in this case the
most resource-efficient once-through fuel cycle is the one that requires the lowest fissile
charge per unit power. If, however, a capability for reprocessing the spent fuel is
eventually envisioned (i.e., if the throwaway option becomes a stowaway option), then the
quantity of fissile material in the spent fuel becomes an important consideration. Esti-
mates of the amounts of the various fissile materials discharged by each reactor type
operating on both the LEU cycle and the MEU(235)/Th cycle are given in Table 7.2-2.

For the PWR and HWR, the use of the MEU/Th fuel cycle rather than the LEU fuel
cycle results in a significant increase in the amount of fissile material contained in
the spent fuel. It should be noted, however, that this increase is primarily the result
of higher feed requirements (i.e., 2350 commitment). In contrast, converting from the
LEU cycle to the MEU/Th cycle does not materially affect the net consumption of the gas-

cooled HTGR and PBR (although it dramatically affects the types of fissile material pre-

sent in their spent fuel). The relatively low values for the discharge quantities for the

gas-cooled reactors is the result of two effects: a lower initial loading; and a design
that is apparently based on higher burnup, which in turn reduces the amount of fissile

material discharged. Finally, it is to be remembered that the resources represented by the
spent fuel inventory are recoverable only when the spent fuel is reprocessed, whereas the
U303 commitment is necessary throughout the operating lifetime of the reactor. Thus, in a
sense, the spent fuel resource must be discounted in time to order to assess the best system
from a resource utilization basis.

The isotopic composition of the spent fuel inventories is also of interest from a
proliferation standpoint. For both the LEU and the MEU/Th once-through fuel cycles, the
fissile uranium content of the spent fuel is denatured (diluted with 238U) and hence is
protected by the inherent isotopic barrier. Thus the plutonium in the fuel would be the
fissile material most subject to diversion. The use of the MEU/Th cycle in place of the
LEU cycle sharply reduces the amount of plutonium produced (by 60-80%, depending on reactor
type), and for both cycles the quantity of plutonium produced in the gas-cooled reactors is
substantially less than that produced in the other reactor types.

Recycle Systems

If recyling of the fissile material in the thermal reactors is permitted, then 233U
{and plutonium) produced in the MEU(235)/Th is recoverable on a schedule dictated by the
production rate of the system. Table 7.2-3 gives estimates of the net lifetime consumption
and production of various fissile materials for the MEU(235)/Th fuel cycle under the as-
sumption that the capability for uranium recycle is available. (The 2350 consumption tabul-
ated does not reflect the 235J lost to the enrichment tailings.) For comparison purposes,
the MEU(233)/Th fuel cycle estimates are also provided. The most striking aspect of
Table 7.2-3 is the apparent 30% reduction of fissile consumption achieved with the 233U system,
indicating the higher value of 233U as a thermal reactor fuel. In fact, the true extent of
this effect is masked somewhat since a large fraction of the recycled fuel for the 2350 makeup
case is in fact 233U. It should also be noted that the MEU(233)/Th cycle generally results in
a smaller net plutonium production, even though the degree of denaturing is less (i.e., the
238) fraction of uranium charged is higher).

As has been stated earlier, the consideration of an MEU/Th cycle that utilizes 233y
makeup presumes the existence of a source of the requisite 233U. Although the 233 in the
spent fuel elements would be recovered, the amount would be inadequate to maintain the
system and an exogenous source must be developed. One means for generating 233U is by
using a Pu/Th-oxide-fueled thermal reactor. Table 7.2-4 summarizes some pertinent results
for the various thermal reactors operating on the Pu/Th cycle. It should be noted that the
HTGR case given in Table 7.2-4 is for a case in which the full core is refueled every 5 yr
and is not optimized for 2330 production. Thus, much of the 233U bred during this period is
consumed in providing power, and the transmutation efficiency (tons of plutonium "transmuted"
into tons of 233Y) is significantly reduced relative to the PWR and SSCR. The transmutation
efficiency of 0.40 for the PWR and SSCR is also rather poor, however, compared to the’1.20
value for a Pu/Th-fueled FBR (see Section 4.5). Production of 233U via plutonium-consuming
transmuters is more suited to fast reactors. On the other hand, it is recognized that Pu/Th-
fueled thermal reactors could provide an interim source of 233p,

7.2.2. Fast Reactors

In this study fast reactors have been considered as possible candidates for two
roles: as power reactors operating on denatured 233U fuel; and as transmuters burning
plutonium to produce 233U, With LMFBRs used as the model, the denatured FBRs were analyzed

for a range of 233U/U enrichments to parameterize the impact of the fuel on the reactor

performance (see Section 4.5), and the transmuter FBRs were analyzed both for a Pu/238y
core driving a ThO, blanket and for a Pu/Th system in which the thorium was included in
both the core and the blanket.

The specified 233U/U enrichment is a crucial parameter for the denatured fast
reactors. Increasing the allowable enrichment permits more thorium to be used in the fuel
material and hence allows the reactors to be more self-sufficient (i.e., reduces the

required 233U makeup). Increasing the 233U enrichment also reduces the amount of fissile
plutonium contained in the discharged fuel, which is obviously desirable from a safeguards
viewpoint. However, increasing the 233U fraction also increases the vulnerability of the
denatured fuel to isotopic enrichment, effectively forcing a compromise between prolifera-
tion concerns regarding the fresh fuel versus proliferation concerns. regarding the spent fuel.
The Towest enrichment feasible for the denatured. LMFBR systems analyzed lies in the range

of 11-14%. Such a system would utilize U0, as fuel and would require significant amounts

of 233Y as makeup since the plutonium it produced could not be recycled into it.

The "breeding" ratio components of certain denatured LMFBRs as a function of 233U
enrichment are shown in Table 7.2-5. The ratio of 233 produced to puf produced is very
sensitive to the specified degree of denaturing in the range of 12-20% 233U/U. This sug-
gests that significant performance improvements may be possible (i.e., increased 233U produc-
tion and decreased 239Pu production) for relatively small increases in the denaturing
criteria. Of course, the overall "breeding" ratio of the denatured LMFBR is significantly
degraded below that for the reference Pu/238| cycle (see Table 4.5-1 in Chapter 4).

233y-fueled system in a fast neutron spectrum, the fast reactor is ideally suited to the
role of a plutonium-fueled transmuter. Moreover, in contrast to the thermal transmuters,
the fast reactors result in a net overall fissile material gain.*

Two types of FBR transmuters have been analyzed for the classical homogeneous FBR
core configuration (a central homogeneous core surrounded by fertile blankets). In the
first, the usual Pu/238)-fueled core was assumed with a ThO, radial blanket (also a ThO, axial
blanket in one case). In the second type a Pu/Th core was assumed. Table 7.2-6 summarizes
the net production data for typical fast transmuters of each type. The overall fissile
gain/cycle with the Pu/238U core is significantly higher than that with the Pu/Th core,
the result being that the "breeding" ratio is not noticeably reduced from the breeding
ratio for the reference Pu/238U cycle. The production of 233U in the Pu/Th reactor is
approximately a factor of 4 higher, but this is achieved as a result of "sacrificial"
consumption of plutonium. Thus, these two reactor types reflect a tradeoff between 233U

study [Proliferation Resistant Large Core Design Study (PRLCDS)] indi-
cates that substantial improvements in the FBR performance is possible.

~ In addition to the systems utilizing the classical homogeneous core configuration,
systems utilizing a heterogeneous core configuration (i.e., interspersed fissile and
fertile regions) were examined as a possible means of improving the performance of fast
reactors operating on alternate fuel cycles. The substitution of different coolants
and fuel forms (i.e., carbides and metals versus oxides) were also considered. The net
effect of these changes is to increase the fuel volume fraction in the reactor core,
harden the spectrum, or, in some cases, both. The advanced fast reactor concepts show
significant improvement regarding the breeding ratio (and doubling time) relative to the
classical design when operating on alternate fuel cycles; however, the performance of the
alternate fuel cycles is still degraded over that of the same reactor type operating on
the Pu/238y cycle.

7.2.3. Symbiotic Reactor Systems

 

As has been stated throughout this report, in considering denatured 233y reactor
systems it is assumed that the denatured reactors will operate as dispersed power systems
supported by fuel cycle services and reactor transmuters located in secure energy centers.
When the system is in full operation no external source of fissile material is supplied;
that is, the system is self-contained. Initially the resource base (i.e., natural uranium)
can be used to provide a source of 233U for implementing the denatured 233 fuel cycle [via
the MEU{235)/Th cycle]; however, a shift to plutonium-fueled transmuters will eventually be
required. During this transition period, the system can be characterized by the rate at
which the resource base is consumed (see Chapter 6}. In order to compare the long-term
potential of various reactor systems under the restrictions imposed by the denatured fuel
cycle, two system parameters have been developed: (1) the energy support ratio, defined
as the ratio of dispersed reactor power relative to the energy center (or centralized) power,
and (2) the inherent growth potential of the system. Since both.the growth rate and the
energy support ratio involve fissile mass flows, they are interrelated. In order to unambig-
uously determine both parameters, the inherent system growth rate is determined at the
asymptotic value of the support ratio, a value which can be viewed as the "natural" operat-
ing ratio of the system.

Three generic types of symbiotic reactor systems can be envisioned by considering
various combinations of thermal converters and fast breeders for the dispersed (D) and
energy center (S) reactors: . thermal(D)/thermal(S), thermal(D)/fast(S), and fast(D)/fast(S).
In order for the generating capacity of a system to increase with time without an external
supply of fissile material, a net gain of fissile material (of some type) must occur. Thus,
the growth potential of the thermal(D)/thermal(S) system is inherently negative; that is,
the installed nuclear capacity must decay as a function of time since the overall conversion
ratio is less than 1. The thermal(D)/fast(S) system, however, does have the potential for
growth since the net fissile gain of the fast component can be used to offset the fissile
loss of the thermal reactors. However, a tradeoff between the support ratio [thermal(D)/
fast(S)] and the growth rate clearly exists for this system, since maximizing the support
ratio will mean that net fissile-consuming reactors will constitute the major fraction of
the system and the growth rate will be detrimentally affected. The fast{D)/fast(S) system
provides a great deal more flexibility in terms of the allowable energy support ratio and
inherent growth rate.

To illustrate the tradeoff between the growth potential and the support ratio, the
"operating envelopes" shown in Fig. 7.2-1 have been generated using denatured PWR data
from Section 4.1 and LMFBR transmuter data from Section 4.5.1. Each envelope represents
the locus of permissible symtiotic parameters (growth rate, support ratio) for the system
considered,! i.e., the permissible combinations of growth rate and support ratio for each
specific reactor combinations. At points A, B, and C on the curves, the transmuter used is,
respectively, the classical (Pu/U)0, reference system with a UD, radial blanket, a (Pu/U)0,
system with a ThO, radial blanket, and a (Pu/Th)0, system with a ThO, radial blanket. At
each point along the curves connecting points A, B, and C, the transmuter is a combination
of the two reactors defined by the end points of each curve segment (see key in upper right-
hand corner). Points within the envelope correspond to combinations of the three trans-

muters in different proportions.

The Tower envelope in Fig. 7.2-1a (repeated in Fig. 7.2-1b) illustrates the tradeoff
for the denatured PWRs and LMFBR transmuters, and the upper envelope depicts the fast/fast
analogue in which the denatured PWR is replaced by an n12% denatured LMFBR., As indicated,
the fast(D)/fast(S) symbiotic system provides a higher growth rate for a given energy sup-
port ratio, and, moreover, the growth rate is always positive. The upper envelope in Fig.
7.2-1b represents the corresponding case using 20% denatured LMFBRs.

In all cases the fast reactor data utilized were taken from Section 4.5.1; that is,
homogeneous LMFBR cores were assumed. The use of a heterogeneous core for the transmuter
reactor would have the effect of displacing the curves in Fig, 7.2-1 upwards and to the
right. The employment of an advanced converter (a high conversion ratio thermal reactor)
would have a similar effect on the thermal/fast curve. Co

7.2.4. Conclusions

Since optimization of the various reactors for the particular fuel cycle considered

was beyond the scope of this study, the results presented above are subject to several uncer-
tainties., Nevertheless, certain general conclusions on the impact of the various fuel
cycles on reactor performance are believed to be valid:

For once-through throwaway systems, the various systems studied are ranked in order
of resource utilization as follows: the HWR on the LEU cycle; the HTGR and HTR-PBR
on either the LEU cycle or on the MEU/Th cycle; and the SSCR and PWR on the LEU cycle.
On the MEU/Th cycle the SSCR and PWR require more uranium than they do on the LEU
cycle and hence do not merit further consideration for once-through operation.

For once-through stowaway systems, in which the fissile material in the
spent fuel is expected to be recovered at some future date, the relative
ranking of the systems would depend on the ultimate destination of the
fissile material. If future nuclear power systems are to be thermal
recycle systems, then early emphasis should be placed on reactors and
fuel cycles that have a high 233U discharge. If the future systems are
to be fast recycle systems, then emphasis should be placed on reactors
and fuel cycles that will provide a plutonium inventory.

For recycle systems utilizing thermal reactors, the preferred basic

fissile material is 233U. However, implementation of a 233U fuel cycle will

require an exogenous source of the fissile material; therefore, it is likely

that the MEU(235)/Th cycle would be implemented first to initiate the produc-

tion of 233U. Both the unburned 235U and the 233U would be recycled; thus the
system would evolve towards the MEU(233)/Th cycle, which is the denatured 233U

cycle as defined in this study. However, it is to be emphasized that these reac-
tors will not produce enough 233U to sustain themselves and separate 233U production
facilities must be operated. A Pu/Th-fueled thermal reactor has been considered

as a 2330 production facility.

For recycle systems utilizing fast reactors, the preferred basic fissile
material is 23%Pu. Using 233U as the primary fissile material or placing
thorium in the core sharply reduces the breeding performance of fast
reactors. However, fast reactors using plutonium fuel and thorium
blankets would be efficient 2330 production facilities.

e The inherent symbiotic nature of the denatured 233U fuel cycle (i.e., dispersed

reactors fueled with denatured 233U and supported by energy-center reactors fueled
with Pu) mandates a tradeoff analysis of growth potential versus energy support

ratio (ratio of power produced outside the energy center to the power produced inside
the center), assuming no external source of fissile material. For thermal/thermal
systems, the growth potential is negative. Fast/thermal systems would permit some of
the net fissile gain (i.e., growth potential) of the fast reactors to be sacrificed
for a higher energy support ratio. Fast/fast systems would provide the highest

growth potential. Factors other than those affecting reactor performance would

also influence the choice of reactors for the system, as has been discussed in Chapters

5 and 6.

7.3. PROSPECTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION AND COMMERCIALIZATION
OF DENATURED 233y FUEL CYCLE

J. C. Cleveland and T. J. Burns
Oak Ridge National Laboratory

Chapter 5 has discussed the reactors in which denatured 233) might be deployed, as
well as the accompanying fuel recycle facility requirements, and has presented schedules
of deployment that are based solely on the minimum time estimated to be required to solve
technical problems. These schedules, which have been used in the nuclear power system
evaluations presented in Chapter 6, were developed in discussions between Hanford Engi-
neering Development Laboratory (HEDL), Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Oak Ridge
National Laboratory (ORNL), Combustion Engineering (CE), and the Department of Energy (DOE)
specifically as a bounding case for assessing the maximum benefits that could be obtained
by employing denatured 23% fuel. As a result, the schedules are not entirely consistent
with those that have been developed subsequently in the Nonproliferation Alternative
Systems Assessment Program (NASAP). While the introduction dates of the lead plants do
not differ significantly, the NASAP scenarios predict a much slower deployment of
commercial reactors.

The reactor introduction dates and deployment schedules used in this study were
based on the following assumptions:

~10 yr to develop/commercialize new fuel design
~14 yr to develop/commercialize modified reactor design
«18 yr to develop/commercialize new advanced converter design

24 yr to develop/commercialize new breeder design
The resulting introduction dates for the various reactors are as listed below, where the

introduction date is defined as the date of startup of the first unit, reactor deployment
thereafter being limited to a maximum introduction rate*' by biennium of 1, 2, 4,... reactors:

1969 - LWRs operating on LEU fuel

1987 - LWRs operating on "denatured 2350" fuel (i.e., MEU(235)/Th)
1991 - LWRs operating on denatured 233U, Pu/U, and Pu/Th fuels
1991 - SSCRs operating on LEU, denatured 233y, or Pu/Th fuels
"1995 - HWRs operating on any of several proposed fuels

1995 - HTGRs operating on any of several proposed fuels

2001 - FBRs operating on Pu/U, Pu/Th, or denatured 233U fuels

Since the above introduction dates are those estimated to be the earliest possible
dates that technical problems could be resolved, it is clear that they cannot be achieved
without substantial initiatives and strong financial support from the U.S. Government.

The introduction rate of any new technology is likely to be less than the maximum rate

noted above, since the construction market loss rate of an established technology is
limited to 10% per year and total nuclear capacity additions cannot exceed 15 GWe/yr.
233 systems are further constrained because the number of 233-burning plants that can
be operated is limited by the 233 production rate.

Even with government support, achieving the postulated schedules would be a difficult
undertaking and would entail considerable risk since it would be impossible to fully
demonstrate an alternate reactor concept before construction on the initial commercial
size units has to begin. A minimum of six years would be required to construct a nuclear
unit, and a minimum of three years would be required prior to construction for R&D and
licensing approval. (It currently takes 10 to 12 yr to license and construct LWRs in

the U.S.) At least two additional years of operation of the demonstration unit would be
necessary to establish satisfactory reactor performance. Thus the earliest time a new
reactor concept could be demonstrated is in the 1991-1995 period indicated, and that
assumes that a commitment to proceed has been made by 1980. Because of design, licensing,
and construction schedules, the first commercial units would have to be ordered well in
advance of the operation of the initial demonstration reactor to achieve the buildup
rates assumed in this study. In order to achieve such commitments prior to the first
successful demonstration, government support would have to extend through the initial
commercial units in addition to the lead plant. The new reactor cycle would also have to
be perceived as economically advantageous to attract the postulated number of customers.

Although several of these reactor/fuel options (e.g., Pu/Th LWRs, denatured advanced
converters, etc.) are based on the use of recycled fissile material, it should be emphasized
that commercial-scale reprocessing is not necessarily required on the same time scale as the
introduction of the recycle fuel types because the demand for recycle fissile material may
be quite modest during the initial introduction phase. In the analysis presented in
Chapter 6, many of the new fuel types are, in fact, introduced before the associated fuel
reprocessing is fully developed, it being assumed that pilot or prototype-plant scale
reprocessing would be adequate to support the initial phase of deployment of fuel recycle.
Hence, although commercial reprocessing of 233U-containing fuels is not projected until
around the turn of the century, limited introduction of denatured 233U fuel is permitted

“as early as 1991. A further argument is that commercial-scale reprocessing for the

alternate fuels would not be feasible until the backlog of spent fuel required for plant
startup had accumulated and the number of reactors utilizing recycled fuel could assure
continued operation of commercial-scale facilities. On the other hand, for 233-containing
spent fuel elements to be available even for pilot-plant processing, it is essential that
early irradiation of thorium in reactors be implemented.

In Section 7.3.1 a possible procedure for implementing and eventually commercializing
the denatured 233U cycle is discussed. Included is a scenario which would provide for the
early introduction of thorium fuel into current light-water reactors and allow an orderly

progression to the utilization of denatured 233) fuel in breeders. The major considera-
tions in commercializing these various reactors operating on alternate fuels, and in
particular on denatured 233U fuel, are summarized in Section 7.3.2.

7.3.1. Possible Procedure for Implementing and
Commercializing the Denatured Fuel Cycle

On the basis of the above assumptions, and the discussion in Section 5.1, it is ob-
vious that the only reactors that could operate on denatured 233U fuel in the near term
(by 1991) would be LWRs. Two possibilities exist for producing 233U for LWRs prior to
the introduction of commercial fuel reprocessing. One involves the use of "denatured 235"
fuel (i.e., MEU(235)/Th) in LWRs, thereby initiating the production of 233j. However, this
scheme suffers from very high fissile inventory requirements associated with full thorium
loadings in LWRs (see Section 4.1). A second option involves the use of partial thorium
loadings in LWRs. In this option ThO, is introduced in certain lattice locations and/or
MEU(235)/Th fuel is used in only a fraction of the fuel rods, the remaining fuel rods
being conventional LEU fuel rods. This scheme significantly reduces the fissile
inventory penalty associated with full thorium loadings in LWRs and - for BWRs may offer
operational benefits as well (see Section 4.1). Also, the partial thorium loadings would
allow experience to be gained on the performance of thorium-based fuels while generating
significant quantities of 233U. Either of the above options for producing 233y will
probably require some form of government incentive since the U30g and separative work
requirements {and associated costs) will increase with the amount of Th utilized in the
once-through throwaway/stowaway modes in LWRs.

Although a reprocessing capability would be required to recover the bred 233U from
thorium fuels, such a capability would not be required for the qualification and
demonstration of thorium-based fuel, which initially would employ 235U rather than 233,

As has been pointed out above, the operation of LWRs with MEU(235)/Th or with partial
thorium loadings could be accomplished during the next decade while the development and
demonstration of the needed fuel cycle facilities for the implementation of the denatured
233 cycle are pursued. Initially the spent fuel could be stored in repositories in

secure fuel storage centers which would represent a growing stockpile of 233 and plutonium.
Additional fuel cycle service facilities, such as isotopic separation, reprocessing, fuel
refabrication and possibly waste isolation, could be introduced into these centers as the
need develops. As pointed out above, these could initially be pilot-plant-scale facilities
followed by larger prototypes and then commercial-scale plants. It has been estimated

(in Section 5.2) that commercialization of a new reprocessing technology would require

12 to 20 yr and the commercialization of a new refabrication technology would require 8 to
15 yr. :

With the deployment of the pilot-scale reprocessing and refabrication facilities,
recovery of Pu and U from spent fuel and the subsequent refabrication of Pu/Th and
denatured 233/Th fuels could be demonstrated within the center. Pu/Th LWRs* could then

 

*That is, thermal transmuters of an LWR design (see Section 4.0). As used in this report,
a transmuter is a reactor (thermal or fast) which burns one fuel and produces another
(specifically, a reactor that burns Pu to produce 233U from Th).

introduced within the centers to provide an additional means for 233U production, as well

as additional power production.

Concurrently, 233U (and unburned 235U) recovered from

MEU(235)/Th or from partial thorium loadings could be utilized in denatured 233U fueled
LWRs introduced at dispersed sites. Later, 233U recovered from the Pu/Th fueled LWRs
could also be utilized to fuel dispersed reactors. At this point the first phase of a
nuclear power system that includes reactors operating both in energy centers and at dis-
persed locations outside the centers would be in effect. During this phase, which is

represented in Fig. 7.3-la, the research
and development that will be required to
deploy Pu-fueled FBR transmuters with
thorium blankets in the energy centers
could be pursued,

With these advance preparations
having been made, by the time conventional
LEU fueling in LWRs begins to phase out
(due to increasing depletion of an eco-
nomical resource base), the power system
would evolve into a fast/thermal combination
employing FBR transmuters and 233U-fueled
converters, which by then might include
denatured LWRs and advanced converters (SSCRs,
HTGRs, or HWRs), depending on the reactor(s)
selected for development (see Fig. 7.3-1b).
Such a system could provide adequate capacity
expansion for modest energy demand growth;
however, if the energy demand is such that
the fast/thermal system is inadequate, an

all-fast system including denatured FBRs could be substituted as shown in Fig. 7.3-1c.
The necessity of the third phase of the energy center development is uncertain at this
time, reflecting as it does assumptions concerning the supply of economically recoverable
Us0g and energy demand.

It is noted that this proposed scheme for implementing the denatured fuel cycle and
instituting the energy center concept relies heavily on two strong technical bases:
currently employed LWR technology, and the research and development already expended on
LMFBRs, which includes the Purex and, to a lesser extent, the Thorex reprocessing

technologies.

While alternative fuel cycle technologies or other types of reactors will

be involved if they can be demonstrated to have resource or economic advantages, the LWR-
LMFBR scenario has been selected as representative of the type of activity that would be

required.

7.3.2. Considerations in Commercializing Reactors Operating
on Alternate Fuels

Although the introduction dates cited above for commercial operation of the various
reactors on alternate fuels are considered to be attainable, they can be realized only if
the first steps toward commercialization are initiated in the near future under strong and
sustained government support. Currently, there is little economic incentive for the
private sector to proceed with such development alone. For example, while recent
evaluations!s? of LWRs have indicated the feasibility of using thorium-based fuels with
current core and lattice designs, either as reload fuels for reactors already in operation
or as both initial and reload fuels for future LWRs, the resource-savings benefit of such
fuels relative to once-through LEU fuel cannot be realized in the absence of fuel repro-
cessing and refabrication services. Moreover, the introduction of thorium into the core
will require high initial uranium loadings, so that the fuel costs for the core would
increase. Obviously, the lack of strong evidence that fuel recycle services would be
available as soon as they were needed would discourage a transition to thorium-based fuels.
Alternatively, such services could not be expected to be available commercially until
utilization of thorium has been established and a market for these services exists.

Thus commercialization of the denatured fuel cycle in LWRs, especially within the time
frame postulated in this study, is unlikely unless major government incentives are provided.

The government incentives could be in the form of guarantees for investment in the
fuel cycle services and/or subsidies for the costs associated with the additional U30g and
separative work required for thorium-based fuels or for partial thorium loadings on the
once-through cycle. This would also encourage the development of the fuel cycle services
by establishing widespread use of thorium-based fuels. The commercial introduction of the
required new LWR fuel cycle services could probably be accomplished by allowing a 7-yr
lead time for construction of demonstration reprocessing and refabrication plants and an
additional 7 yr to construct commercial-size plants. In the meantime, fabrication of
MEU(235)/Th fuel or fuel designs involving partial thorium loadings for LWRs could
probably be accomplished with existing LEU facilities within 2 to 3 yr (Ref. 3) with an
additional 5 to 7 yr required for fuel qualification and/or demonstration. The R&D costs
for demonstrating denatured uranium fuel in commercial reactors would be borne by the
government. )

The commercial introduction in the U. S. of the advanced converter concepts (SSCRs,
HTGRs, and HWRs) would be more difficult today than was the past commercial introduction
of the LWR. Although the introduction in 1958 of the first LWR, the Shippingport reactor,
did involve government support, a relatively small investment was required due to its size
(~68 MWe). The largest base-load power plants were about 300 MWe when LWRs initially pene-
trated the commercial market. Also, during the initial years of deployment of nuclear power,
delays due to licensing procedures were considerably shorter, allowing plants to be construc-
ted and brought on-line more rapidly than the current 10- to 12-yr lead time. The longer
time causes much larger interest payments and much greater risk of licensing difficulties.

Prior to commercial introduction, a demonstration phase of a new advanced converter
concept will be required, and, as has been pointed out in Chapter 5.1, it is assumed here
that the demonstration will be on the reactor's reference cycie, which except for the
HTGR, does not involve thorium. Utilities are unwilling to risk the large investment for
commercial-size plants of 1000 Mie to 1300 MWe on untried concepts. With the large
investments necessary for demonstration units, significant government support would be
required: 1i.e., a demonstration program involving government construction of the initial
unit with government financial support of the first commercial-size plant (1000 Mde to
1300 MWe). For commercial sales to occur, a vendor would have to market it and make the
necessary investment to establish the manufacturing infrastructure.

The SSCR is expected to draw heavily on existing LWR technology, and it may even be
feasible to operate a conventional PWR in the spectral-shift-control mode by addition of
certain equipment. The feasibility of spectral-shift-control has already been demonstrated
in the Belgian VULCAIN experiment (see Section 4.2). While the possibility of retrofitting
existing large PWRs to the SSC mode exists, for reactors going into operation after the
late-1980s, designing PWRs to accept SSC control at some later date is a more likely
possibility. A major impediment to commercial introduction of the SSCR in the U.S. is
likely to be the supply of D,0 and government incentive would probably also be required
in this area, as it will be for the deployment of the CANDU reactor (see below).

The technology for HTGRs is already well under way, with a prototype reactor
currently undergoing startup testing at Fort St. Vrain. Prior to commercial deployment,
however, successful operation of a demonstration HTGR in the 1000-MWe to 1300-MWe range
would be required. Initially, HTGRs could operate on the stowaway MEU(235)/Th or LEU cycle.
Again, commercial-scale reprocessing and refabrication facilities would not be expected until
a demonstrated market for such services is present.

The technology for HWRs is also well advanced, with the CANDU reactors fueled with
natural uranium already commercialized in Canada. It would be necessary, however, to
demonstrate that the CANDU with appropriate modifications for slightly enriched fuel could
be licensed in the U.S. and produce power at an acceptable cost. Commercialization of
the CANDU in the U.S. would probably require government action in three areas:

1. Transfer of technology from Canada to take advantage of CANDU reactor development
and demonstrated performance. Alternatively, a demonstration unit designed to
U.S. licensing standards would be required.

2. ‘Government financial support of a large (1000-MWe to 1300-MWe) CANDU in the U.S.

3. Development of D,0 production facilities in the U.S, on a larger scale than
currently exists.

CANDUs operating on thorium-based fuels could possibly be introduced simultaneously
with the deployment in the U.S. of the CANDU reactor concept itself. Assuming Canadian
participation, thorium-based fuel could be demonstrated in Canadian reactors prior to the
operation of a CANDU reactor in the U.S. Furthermore, if by then the LWR thorium fuel

cycle services of reprocessing and refabrication had been commercially developed, the
extension of these services to CANDY reactors could be built on the existing LWR facility
base. Otherwise, the commercial introduction of these services could not be expected
until some time after it becomes clear that CANDU reactors will be commercially deployed
in the U.S. with thorium fuel, thereby indicating the existence of a market for associated
fuel cycle services. The introduction dates postulated for the alternate fuel cycle
CANDUs assume that requisite fuel cycle services have already been developed for thorium-
fueled LKWRs.

As pointed out in Section 5.1, no attempt has been made here to consider the com-
mercialization prospects of FBRs since the INFCE program (International Nuclear Fuel Cycle
Evaluation) is currently studying the role of FBRs in nuclear power scenarios and their
results should be available in the near future.

In summary, it is apparent that significant barriers exist for the private sector
either to convert LWRs to thorium-based fuels or to develop advanced reactor concepts.
While U30g is still relatively inexpensive, the economics of alternate reactor and fuel
cycle concepts at best show marginal savings relative to the LWR and consequently their
development and deployment would have to be heavily subsidized by the government. In the
longer term, as the price of uranium increases due to depletion of lower-cost uranium
deposits, these alternate concepts could achieve superior economic performance compared
to the LWR. The most optimistic introduction dates for advanced converters result in a
relatively small installed capacity by the year 2000, and, as shown in Chapter 6, the
impact of advanced converters on the cumulative U30g consumption by the year 2000 would
be small. However, deployment of alternate reactor concepts in the time from 1995-2000
could have significant impact on resource use in the period 2000-2025. Except for HTGRs,
none of the alternate reactor concepts that promise improved resource utilization has
undergone licensing review by the government. Due to these factors, conversion to the
denatured fuel cycle and/or introduction of alternate reactor concepts on a time scale
which can dissuade international tendencies toward conventional plutonium recycle will
require very significant government involvement and financial incentives in the near
future.

7.3.3. Conclusions
From the above discussion the following conclusions can be summarized:

¢ The production of 233U for the denatured 233U fuel cycle could be initiated
by introducing Th into the LWRs currently operating on the once-through
cycle. However, there is an economic disincentive within the private
sector to convert LWRs to thorium-based fuels because of the increased
costs associated with the higher U305 and separative work requirements.
Thus commercialization of the denatured fuel cycle is not plausible
unless government incentives are provided. Initial production of 233y

 
 

7-28

for later recycle could be initiated by the mid-1980's if such incentives
were forthcoming, Recycle of 2330 on a commercial scale is not plausible
prior to the year 2000, however.

¢ The introduction of advanced reactor concepts that would provide significant
resource savings beyond the year 2000 will require very large government
support for R&D, for demonstration facilities, and for lead commercial
plants. If a rapid deployment schedule were required, additional resources
would have to be committed to cover the risks of early commercial plants.

o Fuel service/energy centers whose ultimate purpose is to utilize plutonium both
for energy production and for 233U production would progress through various
phases. Initially these centers would be fuel storage facilities. With the
introduction of reprocessing and retabrication in the center, LWRs located at
dispersed sites would be fueled with denatured 233U. Concurrently Pu-fueled
thermal transmuters would be deployed within the center. Ultimately, to meet
long-term energy demands, Pu-fueled fast transmuters would be introduced
within the centers.

eo It is desirable that a fuel recycle R&D program be initiated for denatured fuels
at the same time a decision is made to fabricate thorium-containing fuel
for large-scale irradiation in existing LWRs., Pilot-scale recycle facilities
could be required within seven years after the initiation of a thorium
irradiation program.

7.4. ADEQUACY OF NUCLEAR POWER SYSTEMS UTILIZING DENATURED 233y FUEL
FOR MEETING ELECTRICAL POWER DEMANDS

An important measure for evaluating a nuclear power system is whether it can meet
projected power demands with the uranium resources estimated to be available at an accept-
able cost. This section summarizes the results of analyses performed in this study to
determine whether various nuclear power systems utilizing denatured 2330 fuel could meet
a projected power demand of 350 GWe installed capacity by the year 2000 and a net increase
of 15 GWe/year through the year 2049, the total capacity in the year 2050 being 1100 GWe.
The analyses were based on a uranium supply model shown in Fig. 7.4-1 and in Table B-7
(Appendix B), which provides both conservative and optimistic predictions of the uranium
supply as a function of cost.

The power systems analyzed are described in detail in Chapter 6. They are comprised
of LEU-LWRs operating in conjunction with LWRs on other fuel cycles or in conjunction with
one of the three types of advanced converters (SSCR, HWR, or HTGR) considered in the study.
In some cases, FBRs are included in the system. Since the maintenance of proliferation-
resistant power systems was one of the primary concerns, the concept of a secure energy

center supporting dispersed reactors was
used, with the fuel utilized in the dis-
persed reactors restricted to LEU (or SEU)
and denatured fuels, A reactor operating on
the denatured 233U fuel cycle is not self-
sustaining, however, and therefore it
requires an exogenous source of 233U. In
the power systems studied, the 233y is
provided by MEU/Th-fueled thermal reactors
or plutonium-fueled thermal and/or fast
transmuters. These reactors, of course,
also contribute to the power generation,

Because the transmuters have plutonium cores,
however, they must be located within the secure
energy centers. (Note: With this restriction

the "energy support ratio” of a nuclear
system becomes a second important measure

of evaluation, as is discussed in Section
7.2.3. The energy support ratios for the
systems described here are given in Appendix
C, along with other detailed results from
the analyses.)

A nuclear power systems evaluation such as the one performed in this study requires
three basic components. First, the various nuclear power systems to be analyzed must be
identified. Second, there must be an analytical model capable of modeling each system in
sufficient detail that differences between the systems can be accurately calculated. And
finally, a data base that contains both reactor performance data and economic data must be
developed. Sections 7.4.) and 7.4.2 below give brief descriptions of the model and data
base as they were applied to this evaluation. The results of the analyses for specified
nuclear power systems are then summarized in Sections 7.4.3, 7.4.4 and 7.4.5, with the
detailed results presented in Appendix C.

7.4.1. The Analytical Method

Two fundamental aspects of the model used in the analyses relate to the nuclear
energy demand and the U30g supply, both of which have been specified above. The nuclear
energy demand assumed in the model is consistent with the current construction plans of
utilities through the 1980's. As more nuclear units were required, with the supply of
low-cost U;0g progressively depleted, it was assumed that more expensive lower-grade
uranium resources would be mined. This was modeled by assuming that the long-run marginal
cost of U30g was an increasing function of the cumulative amount mined. For a particular
nuclear policy option, the plant construction pattern was therefore governed by economics
and/or uranium utilization. :

Two different optimizing patterns were used in the study. In the first runs
economic competition between nuclear fuels and coal was assumed, and the plants were
selected to minimize the levelized cost of power over time. These runs, which are pre-
sented in Appendix D, indicated that nuclear power did not compete well at U30g prices
above $160/1b for the assumptions used in this study. Thus for the runs of all-nuclear
power systems, described in Chapter 6 and summarized here, an attempt was made to satisfy
the demand for nuclear power with the U30g available at a price less than $160/1b U30g.

Other considerations also affected the selection of the nuclear power plants to be
constructed. For example, a reactor that required Pu or 233U could not be constructed
unless the projected supply of fissile material was sufficient throughout the reactor's
lifetime. In addition, a nuclear plant design that differed from established technology
could be introduced only at a limited rate. Furthermore, once the manufacturing capability
to produce a particular reactor type was well established, the maximum rate at which that
reactor type could lose its share of the new construction market was limited to a speci-
fied rate.

Both the total power cost of each nuclear policy option and the total power cost
of each reactor type available in each option were calculated. For each reactor type, the
total power cost was calculated for four components -- capital, operation and maintenance,

taxes, and fuel cycle. The fuel cycle costs were, in turn, divided into seven components --
233, yranium, thorium, enrichment, plutonium, fabrication, and reprocessing.

It is to be noted that the power systems calculated were all assumed to be U.S.
based, the input data all being of U.S. origin. With appropriate input modifications,
however, the model could be used for other scenarios. For example, it could be used to
analyze the potential for the deployment of transmuters both to produce power in secure
states and to produce 233 for export to states wishing to base their own power systems
on thermal reactors without national reprocessing.

“7.4.2. Data Base

The data required by the model for each reactor type include power level, annual
isotopic charge and discharge, annual fabrication requirements, introduction dates, etc.
These data are presented in Tables 6.1-2 and 6.1-3 in Chapter 6. It is to be pointed out,
however, that the data are for reactors of essentially conventional designs, and that the
U0g requirements for the various reactor types could be reduced through design optimiza-
tion. (Note: The effect of optimizing LWRs has been considered in a separate analysis
and is discussed in Section 7.4.3 below.).

The major parameters in the economic data base used for this study are capital costs,
uranium costs, fabrication costs, spent fuel disposal costs, reprocessing costs, and money
costs. The entire data base, which was developed in a joint effort involving government
and industry representatives, is presented in Appendix B.

7.4.3. Results for Price-Limited Uranium Supplies

As noted above, the denatured nuclear power systems utilized various combinations
of thermal converters and fast reactors. These in turn were examined under six fuel cycle
options, which are summarized in Table 7.4-1 (Options 4-8). In addition, the same reactor
types were examined under three reference fuel cycle options -- a throwaway/stowaway option
(Option 1) and two plutonium-uranium options (Options 2 and 3). Four cases were considered
under each option, each case being distinguished by the type of converter being emphasized --
LWRs, SSCRs, HWRs, or HTGRs. Thus a total of 36 different nuclear power systems were
analyzed.

The maximum nuclear capacity and the year in which the maximum occurs for each
nuclear system studied is shown in Table 7.4-2 for the two uranium supply assumptions (see
Fig. 7.4-1). As stated earlier, with the intermediate-cost supply it was assumed that 6
million ST of Us0g could be recovered at costs Tess than $160/1b, while with the high-cost
supply it was assumed that 3 million ST of Uj0g would be available.

*Four cases considered under each option, identified by letters L, S, H, and G to denote

The effect of varying the fuel cycle system can be seen by reading across Table 7.4-2
and the effect of changing the converter reactor option can be deduced by reading down a
column. An installed nuclear canacity of 1100 GWe in year 2050 indicates that the projected

energy demand is fully met by tne reactors in a given nuclear fuel cycle system.

Non-FBR Systems, Options 1, 2, 4, and 5

For the high-cost U30s supply case (3 million ST Us0g below $160/1b), it is evident

that introducing advanced converters on the throwaway/stowaway fuel cycle (Option 1) has
little effect on the maximum attainable nuclear capacity. This is directly due to the

introduction dates assumed for the advanced converter reactors.

By the time the converters

 
 

7-34

dominate the new capacity being built, a very significant fraction of the U0 supply has
already been committed to the standard LWR. It follows that if the intermediate-cost U30g

were used (6 million ST U30s below $160/1b), together with the same nuclear growth rate, the
‘addition of an advanced converter would have a much larger impact, For example, in this case
the system including HWRs has a maximum attainable installed nuclear capacity for the throwaway/
stowaway option that is approximately 17% greater than the installed capacity of the system
comprised of LWRs alone, while for the high-cost supply case it is only 3% greater.

In Option 2 converter reactors are operated on the LEU fuel cycle outside the energy
center and Pu/U converters and 23SU(HE)/Th, 233%/Th, and Pu/Th HTGRs are operated inside
the center. As expected, the thermal recycle systems all support nuclear power growth
with less U30g consumption than the once-through systems of Option 1, and, in general, the
options including advanced converter reactors (SSCRs, HWRs, and HTGRs) provide for increased
‘maximum installed capacity relative to the LWR option for both the high-cost and the
intermediate-cost Ui0g supply assumptions. The HTGR option (2G) provides for the greatest
level of installed nuclear capacity for both U30g supplies. The resource efficiency of
these scenarios is largely due to the fact that they include the nondenatured 23 3J/Th fuel
cycle which is used only by HTGRs in this study.

Option 4 utilizes only denatured 235U and 233 fuels and LEU fuel, all outside the
energy center, and none of the plutonium produced is recycled. Here it is interesting to
observe that for both uranium supply assumptions the HWR converter option (4H) has installed
capacity levels that are greater than or equal to those of any other converter reactor
option, while the HTGR option (4G) has the lowest installed capacities. It appears that
the HTGRs used in this study do not operate efficiently on denatured fuel cycles relative
to the other converters available (see also Options 5UG and 5TG). This can be partially
attributed to the fact that the reactors used in these evaluations were not optimized for

the roles in which they were employed, and for the HTGR this has a greater impact than for
the other reactor types.

Option 5 uses denatured and LEU-fueled reactors outside the center and Pu/Th-fueled
converters within the center. This option is divided into two suboptions: Option 5U, in
which both denatured 235 and denatured 23%) units are used; and Option 5T, in which the
denatured 235y units are excluded.. In both cases, 233 is produced in the Pu/Th converters.
In these cases the HWR options produce the greatest maximum installed nuclear capacity
with the high-cost ore supply, and both the HWR options and SSCR options meet the power
demand with the intermediate-cost ore supply. Again, the HTGRs do not appear to operate as

efficiently as the other converters for the reasons cited above.

In summary, non-FBR power systems using denatured fuel but discarding plutonium
require about the same amount of U30g as thermal systems on the classical Pu/U cycle and
offer potential nuclear growth rates that are roughly the same. If the plutonium is re-

cycled in Pu/Th converters, the systems have potential nuclear growth rates that exceed
those of analogous reactors operating on the Pu/U fuel cycle. If the intermediate-cost
U30g supply assumption proves to be correct, advanced converters in the recycle mode can
satisfy the postulated nuclear energy demand through year 2050 at competitive costs.
This analysis therefore indicates that, at least under optimistic resource conditions,
advanced converters using denatured fuels can defer the need for commercial use of an
"inexhaustible" energy source (such as FBRs) beyond the year 2050.

FBR Systems, Options 3, 6, 7, and 8

Table 7.4-2 shows that almost all of the nuclear system options using FBR fuel
cycles (Options 3, 6, 7, and 8) are able to meet the projected nuclear energy demand
without mining Us0g5 costing more than $160/1b. The only exception is Option 8 for the
case of the high-cost ore supply, and even this option, which includes the Pu-Th/Th
breeder and the denatured 233U breeder, would satisfy the demand if slightly improved FBR
reactor design parameters were used. Thus, as was expected, this analysis indicates that
FBR-containing systems will potentially support much larger nuclear capacities than
thermal recycle systems and/or will require less mining. The Th-containing FBR cycles
supporting dispersed denatured converters perform as well as the analogous Pu/U cycles
within the framework of this analysis. Of the Th-containing cycles, the FBR with a Pu/U
core and Th blanket is particularly resource-efficient.

7.4.4. Results for Unconstrained Resource Availability

 

The preceding results represent a somewhat artificial situation because of the
$160/1b limitation on the U;0g availability. That is, the failure to meet the projected
power demand in many of the scenarios investigated is a direct result of the system's
inability to utilize U30g costing more than $160/1b. In order to address the potential
of the various fuel cycle/reactor options under the condition that the projected demand
for nuclear power must be satisfied, the $160/1b constraint was removed. The cumulative
quantity of U30g required to completely satisfy the demand for nuclear generating capacity
was then estimated for each of the nuclear power options; these results are presented in
Table 7.4-3.

The rate at which U30g is required to support the projected nuclear capacity
represents an important additional constraint on a system. An overall maximum U30g
production rate is difficult to specify because of the possibility of importing U;0g
and because any prediction of the production of U30g from uncertain resources in the next
century is highly speculative.. Recognizing this, and also recognizing that the required
U30g production rate is still an important variable, the maximum required U;0g production’
rates for each scenario were estimated and are tabulated in Table 7.4-4. As a point of
reference, note that DOE has estimated that domestic mining and milling could sustain a
production rate of 60,000 ST of U30g per year in the 1990s by developing U;05 reserves
and potential resources at forward costs of less than $30 per pound.

*Forward costs do not include the capital costs of facilities or industry profits, which
are included in the long run marginal costs used in this study.

The results presented in Tables 7.4-3 and 7.4-4 indicate the relative resource

efficiencies of the various nuclear power systems since the energy produced was held
constant. It should be noted that although the U30g cost limitation of $160/1b was
removed, the uranium requirements were estimated. for both the intermediate- and high-cost
U30g supplies. Hence, the differences in the cumulative U30g requirements and annual
U30g production rates for similar fuel cycle/reactor combinations are due to different
reactor mixes associated with each uranium price structure.

Satisfying the demand for 1100 GWe in year 2050 with the standard LWR once-through
cycle (Option 1L) would require that about 183,000 ST U30g be produced in year 2049, with
a cumulative consumption of 7.1 million ST through that date. Introducing advanced
converters (Options 1S, 1H, and 16) would reduce both the cumulative U30g consumption and
the maximum production rate requirements on the once-through cycle — in the case of the
HWR as Tow as 5.6 million ST and 120,000 ST/yr, respectively.

Thermal recycle modes (Options 2, 4, 5U, and 5T) would reduce U304 consumption
through year 2049 to within the range of 3.3 to 5.4 million ST Uj30g, depending on the
policy option chosen and to a lesser extent on the uranium cost level. The maximum U304
consumption would vary from 62,000 to 120,000 ST/yr. The resource consumption is sensi-
tive to the uranium price level to the extent that high-cost uranium favors the choice of
efficient high-capital-cost systems such as the HWR, whereas lower-cost uranium favors
continued use of LWRs even if other reactors are available.

It should be noted that when plutonium is recycled in thermal power systems includ-
ing denatured reactors (Options 5U and 57) the total resource requirements (including Pu)

 
 

7-38

are generally less than those for thermal systems in the Pu-U recycle mode (Option 2).
Discarding Pu from the recycle of denatured thermal systems (Option 4) reduces the
efficiency of the denatured cycle.

The nuclear power systems that include fast breeders (Options 3, 6, 7, and 8) have
cumulative U30g requirements through year 2049 within the range of 2.71 to 4.41 million ST
U30g in the case of the intermediate-cost U30g supply and within 2.6 to 3.2 million ST

27g in the case of the high-cost supply. The maximum U30g consumption varies from 66,000
to 93,000 ST/yr for the intermediate-cost supply and from 52,000 to 68,000 ST/yr for the
high-cost supply. The breeder-containing options are able to.adjust the reactor mix
effectively to reduce Ug consumption in the event Ui0g costs are high. The larger the
fraction of breeders in the reactor mix, the Tower the U40g requirements.

It should be noted that the Ugg requirements for the systems containing breeders
with Pu/U cores and Th blankets (Options 6 and 7) are similar to the U;0g requirements
for the system containing the classical Pu/U breeder (Option 3). The systems containing
breeders with Pu/Th cores and Th blankets require somewhat more Ug on an integrated
basis.

The U40g requirements presented in Table 7.4-4 qualitatively support the ranking of
cycles in the cost-constrained runs. Specifically, the power systems operating on once-
through cycles require 5.6 to 7.1 million ST U30g to satisfy the demand for nuclear
power through 2050, the thermal-recycle systems require 3.3 to 5.4 million ST U30g, and
the breeder-containing systems require 2.6 to 4.4 million ST U305. The systems including
denatured 233 reactors require approximately the same cumulative amount of Ui0g as their
Pu/U counterparts. The results presented in Table 7.4-5 also support these statements:
the required production rates are highest for the once-through systems; they are reduced
somewhat for the thermal recycle cases; and they are lowest for the breeder-containing
scenarios.

7.4.5. Systems Employing Improved LWRs and Enrichment Technology

While not considered in the analysis summarized above, it is possible to optimize
LWR designs to greatly enhance their utilization of U30g per unit energy produced. These
optimized designs may result in reduced U;0g requirements of up to 30% relative to more
conventional LWR designs. The 30% improvement in LWR U30g requirements assumes no spent
fuel reprocessing, the improvements being the result of increased discharge exposure fuels
and/or reconfigured reactor cores.

The effect of developing these LWR cores optimized for throwaway/stowaway operation
was examined by assuming that the U;0g utilization would be improved in séquential incre-
ments U30g requirements equal to 90% of the standard LWR. It was also assumed that this
improvement would be retrofitted into existing reactors. Similarly, reactors starting up

Neither the down time required for retrofitting nor the associated costs were addressed
in this analysis.

between 1991 and 2001 were assumed to have U0g requirements equal to 80% of the standard
LWR, with the improvements retrofitted to all existing reactors at that time. Finally,
those plants beginning operation after 2001 were assumed to have Uj0g requirements equal
to 70% of the standard LWR, again with the improvements retrofitted to existing plants.

In addition, the effect of a lower enrichment tails assay was examined for both the
standard and the optimized LWR designs. - The standard enrichment tails schedule assumed
that the assay fraction was a constant 0.0020. The reduced tails schedule began at 0.0020
but decreased to 0.0005 between 1980 and 2010 and remained constant thereafter. The latter
tails schedule was assumed to represent a changeover to an improved enrichment technology.

The effects of considering both the improved LWR design and the improved tails
technology are summarized in Table 7.4-5. The results show that with tails improvements
alone the U30g requirements may be reduced by 16% by year 2029. This reduced level of
U30g consumption translates to an increase in the maximum installed capacity of approxi-
mately 60 GWe for standard LWRs on the throwaway/stowaway fuel cycle.

*Normal tails assume 0.2 w/o 235U in 2380; improved tails as-
sumed 0.05 w/o 235 in 238y; 75% capacity factor.

With improved LWR technologies (no tails improvements) the Us0g consumption levels
could be reduced 25% in year 2029. This translates to an increase of 100 GWe in the

~ maximum installed capacity for optimized LWRs. If both reduced tails and advanced LWR

technologies were used, the maximum achievable installed nuclear capacity would increase
by about 144 GWe.

It is important to place these results within the perspective of the results re-
ported in Table 7.4-2. The maximum installed nuclear capacities obtained with these
improvements are comparable to those for standard LWRs operating on the classical Pu/238y
recycle mode or on the denatured 23% cycle. Obviously, if both improved LWRs and Pu
recycle were available, the nuclear capacity could be even greater.

7.4.6 Conclusions

~ From the preceding discussion and the results presented in Chapter 6 and Appendix C,
the following conclusions may be drawn concerning the reactor options, the fuel cycle
options, and the U30g supply cases analyzed for this study. It should be emphasized that
the conclusions are tentative and may be changed as a result of different demand growth
projections or more accurate or improved reactor characterizations.

e If nuclear power systems were limited to the once-through cycle, it would be
necessary to utilize U30g sources at above $160/1b sometime between year 2009
and year 2035 in order to satisfy the projected nuclear power capacity demand.

e If nuclear power systems were limited to the once-through cycle and to Ui0g
supplies below $160/1b, the U.S. nuclear power capacity would peak some time
between 2009 and 2035. Nuclear power would fail to satisfy the projected
nuclear demand during the 10-year period preceding the peak. If improved LWR
designs and improved tails stripping techniques were implemented, the peaks
would occur 10 to 15 years later.

e If the high-cost U30g supply is assumed (3 million ST below $160/1b), all
once-through systems, regardless of the converter type employed, result in
approximately the same maximum installed nuclear capacity. For less-restrictive
Uy0g supply assumptions, advanced converters have time to increase the total
nuclear power supply on the once-through cycle.

e Thermal recycle systems have the capability of substantially reducing requirements
for Ug0g or of increasing the maximum installed capacity over the capacity of the
once-through cycle. The best thermal recycle systems can support over twice the
maximum installed capacity of the once-through cycle, and, under the intermediate-
cost U30g supply assumption (6 million ST below $160/1b), they can fully support
the assumed nuclear power growth through year 2050.

e The systems including breeders have the capability of substantially reducing the
mining requirements and/or increasing the maximum installed capacity beyond thermal
systems with recycle. This capability is needed to satisfy the nuclear capacity:
demand through year 2050 under the high-cost uranium supply assumption (3 million
ST below $160/1b).

¢ Thermal recycle systems including denatured 233U reactors have the capability of
supporting more nuclear capacity than the thermal Pu/238y recycle systems. However,
achieving this capability would usually require Pu utilization.

e From a resource utilization point of view, nuclear power systems utilizing denatured

233 reactors can be started equally well with MEU(235)/Th or Pu/Th fuels, providing
the eventual use of the plutonium generated in the MEU(235)/Th cycle is assumed.

demand through 2050 with the U30g resource base assumed in this study.

7.5. TRADE-OFF ANALYSIS AND OVERALL STRATEGY CONSIDERATIONS

T. J. Burns and I. Spiewak
Oak Ridge National Laboratory

One of the principal concerns about civilian nuclear power centers on the possible
diversion of recycled fissile material to weapons fabrication, in particular, the diver-
sion of plutonium. Depending on the degree to which this concern is addressed, various
nuclear power strategies can be developed between the current no-reprocessing option (and

* hence no recycle) and options that would permit the unconstrained recycle of plutonium.

The denatured 233U fuel cycle that is the subject of this report provides a middle ground
within which nuclear power strategies may be developed. Although the denatured cycle does
employ recycled fissile material, it can be structured so that it has more proliferation-
resistant characteristics than the plutonium cycle. Before any proposed new fuel cycle
can be implemented, however, it must be addressed in the light of practical considerations
such as the supply of U;0g available, the projected nuclear power demand, the reactors

and fuel cycles available, and the technological and implementation constraints imposed

on the nuclear power system. These various aspects of nuclear power systems utilizing
denatured 2330 fuel have been discussed at length throughout this report. It is the
purpose of this final section of the report to restate the most important conclusions of
the study and to address trade-offs inherent in developing nuclear policy strategies that
include the denatured 2330 fuel cycle as opposed to strategies that do not.

The nuclear power systems that have been examined can be classified as (a) no-
recycle options, (b) classical reference recycle options, and (c) denatured recycle
options. An integrated assessment of options in these three categories is presented in
matrix form in Table 7.5-1, which also serves as a basis for the discussion that follows.
In evaluating the systems, each option was characterized on the basis of the following
criteria:

{1} Nuclear proliferation resistance relative to other nuclear power systems.
(2) Potential for commercialization of the reactor/fuel cycle components.

(3) Technical feasibility on a reasonable schedule (and cost) for research,
development and demonstration of the reactor/fuel cycle components.

(4) Capability of the system for meeting long-term nuclear energy demands.

(5) Economic feasibility.

As has been pointed out in earlier sections of this report, throughout this study
the United States has been used as a base case since the available input data (that is,
reactor design data, nuclear growth projections, etc.) required for the analytical model
are all of U.S. origin. However, with appropriate data bases, the same model could apply
to other individual nations. Moreover, it could apply to cooperating nations, in which
case the nuclear strategy would include a mutual nuclear interdependence of the participat-
ing nations.

7.5.1. No-Recycle Options

Since commercial-scale reprocessing is not envisioned for some time, the currently
employed once-through low-enriched uranium cycle (LEU) represents the only significant
commercial possibility in the near term. At current ore and separative work prices,
power generated via the once-through LEU cycle in LWRs is economically competitive with
other energy sources. The once-through fuel cycle also has favorable proliferation-
resistant characteristics: its fresh fuel contains an inherent isotopic barrier; and
while its spent fuel contains plutonium, the fuel is contaminated with highly radioactive
fission products and thus has a radiation barrier. On the basis of these and other
advantages (see Case A in Table 7.5-1), the continued near-term use of the once-through
LEU fuel cycle for nuclear-based electrical generation is desirable.

The principal drawback of the once-through fuel cycle lies in the fact that it is
tied to resources that will become increasingly more expensive. Satisfying the nuclear
demand postulated in this study to year 2050 would require the consumption of 5.6 to 7.1
million tons U30g. An equally important consideration is that it would also require an
annual Ui0g production capacity of 90,000 to 130,000 tons of Ug by the year 2030. As
the price of uranium increases, there will be incentives to reduce both these requirements
by using uranium more efficiently. For example, improved LWR technology could potentially
reduce U;0g consumption levels up to about 25% in the year 2030. A reduction in enrichment
tails assay could result in an additional reduction in the uranium requirements of about
16%; however, this would require about 80% additional SWU capacity to maintain a constant
production level of enriched uranium. But even with these gains the viability of the once-
through cycle would be limited by the availability and producibility of U;0g from uncertain
resources in the next century.

A second once-through option (Case B in Table 7.5-1) would involve the addition of
advanced converters to the power system either on the LEU cycle or on the MEU(235)/Th cycle.
The implementation of the MEU(235)/Th once-through cycle in LWRs is uneconomic relative to
the LEU cycle primarily because it would require higher fissile loadings and hence higher
U30g commitments. And even if incentives were provided, the use of thorium-based fuels in
LWRs would necessitate additional fuel R,D&D. To use either the LEU cycle or the MEU/Th
cycle in other reactor types would entail significant expenditures to commercialize the

reactors in the U.S. Moreover, the generic drawback of once-through cycles — that is, the
uncertainty in the size of the economically recoverable resource base - would remain. On

the other hand, as costs for extracting the resource base increase (to above $100/1b U40g,
for example), commercialization of the alternate reactors will become more attractive.

If continued reliance on once-through fuel cycles is to be a long-term policy, it
would be desirable to make provisions for restricting the spread of enrichment facilities.
Also, safeguarding the spent fuel elements is necessary since the plutonium bred in the
spent fuel represents a potential source of weapons-usable material which becomes increas-
ingly accessible as.its radioactivity decays with time. Near-term resolution of the storage

 
 

7-44

question could be accomplished via international facilities chartered for just such a pur-
pose. Such centers (and the institutional arrangements attendant to them) could also serve
as forerunners of the full-scale fuel cycle service/energy center concept considered for the
recycle-based options.

[
7.5.2. Recycle Options

The inherent limitations of the resource base would require the use of recycled
material to supplement the LEU cycle if the growth of a nuclear-based electrical generation
capacity were to be sustained. Table 7.5-1 compares three recycle options utilizing de-
natured fuel (Cases E-G) with two reference recycle options utilizing the classical Pu/U
cycle (Cases C and D). The two reference cycles differ in that Case D employs FBRs while
Case C does not. The denatured cases differ in that Cases E and F are all-thermal systems

and Case G employs FBRs in addition to thermal reactors. Case E uses only LWRs as dis-
persed reactors while Case F uses both LWRs and advanced converters (HWRs, HTGRs, or SSCRs).

It has been assumed that, given a strong government mandate and financial support,
all the fuel cycles and reactor types that have been considered in this report could be
developed by the time they would be needed - by the year 2000 or later. However, the
Pu/U cycle is much closer to being commercialized than the Th-based cycles, and, as noted
in Chapter 5, the research, development, and demonstration costs for implementing the
denatured 233U fuel cycle in LWRs would be between $0.5 and $2.billion higher than the
costs for implementing the reference Pu/U cycle in LWRs. If the HWR or HTGR were the
reactor of choice, an additional $2 billion would be required for reactor research,
development, and demonstration.

A system in which reactors consuming Pu and producing 233U (transmuters) are
combined with reactors operating on denatured 233U fuel appears to have somewhat better
proliferation-resistant characteristics than a system based solely on the Pu/U cycle.

The "fresh" 233) fuel is denatured with 238U, and thus some of the proliferation-resistant
features of the front end of the LEU cycle would be extended to the recycle mode. That

is, both chemical and isotopic separation of the fresh fuel would be necessary to obtain
weapons~-usable material. Additionally, the fresh denatured fuel is contaminated with
radioactivity due to the decay daughters of a 232( impurity that is unavoidably produced
along with the 233y, and the associated complications introduced into the isotope separation
procedure would be severe. By contrast, weapons material could be obtained from Pu/U or
233/Th fuel through chemical separation alone, although the 233 obtained would also be
radioactive due to the 232) daughters. (The Pu/U fuel would also be radioactive but much

less so.)

The spent denatured fuel represents a somewhat lower proliferation risk than the
spent fuel from other options would. The recovery of a given quantity of Pu bred in the
238Y denaturant would require the processing of more material than would be necessary in

em aa.

either the Pu/U cycle or the LEU cycle (about 2.5 times move than the LEU cycle). It must
be noted, however, that the presence of chemically separable fissile material at any point
in a fuel cycle represents a proliferation risk, and thus these points must be subject

to stringent safeguards. Also, the potential spread of enrichment facilities and improve-
ments in enrichment technology (and hence greater ease in obtaining fissile material) may
make such differences between the various fuel cycles less important.

As is evident from Table 7.5-1, the private sector prefers the Pu/U cycle to the
denatured fuel cycle, and a government mandate would probably be required to induce
commercialization of denatured recycle in preference to Pu/U recycle. Private investors
have developed recycle technology for mixed-oxide Pu fuels extensively, while putting
little effort into recycle technology for thorium-based fuels.

Because reprocessing is inherent in the denatured 233 cycle, implementation of the
cycle is likely to require the development of "fuel service centers," safeguarded facilities
whose purpose would be to protect sensitive fuel cycle activities. Such centers could
evolve from the safeguarded spent fuel storage facilities required for the once-through
fuel cycles. For the recycle scenarios, the center would first contain sensitive fuel
cycle facilities to produce denatured 2330 fuels from stored 233U-containing spent fuel;
later it would include those reactors that operate on fuel from which the fissile component
could be chemically separated. Under the assumption that no weapons-usable fuel that is
chemically separable can be used in dispersed reactors, a power system utilizing denatured
233) fuel has a significant advantage over one based on the Pu/U cycle alone. The Pu/U
cycle would necessitate that all reactors be constrained to the energy center, which will
result in a penalty for electric power transmission since energy centers could not be sited
as conveniently as dispersed reactors. With a denatured system, a significant fraction (up
to 85%) of the power could be dispersed since only the Pu-fueled transmuters would be oper-
ated in such centers and thus the system could maintain a relatively high energy-support
ratio (ratio of nuclear capacity installed outside center to nuclear capacity installed
inside center).

Evaluation of the denatured 233U fuel cycle on the basis of economics and/or energy
supply is difficult due to the uncertainties in unit cost factors and potential energy
demand. With the economic and energy demand assumptions employed in the analysis pre-
sented in Chapter 6, however, the economics of the denatured cycle appear to be equivalent
to, or slightly better than, the economics of the classical Pu/U cycle for moderate
growth-rate scenarios (i.e., those employing combinations of fast and thermal systems).
Although the fuel cycle unit costs of the denatured cycle were assumed to be higher than
those of the Pu/U cycle, power systems utilizing denatured 233U fuel typically allow a
larger fraction of the reactors constructed to be thermal reactors, which have lower
capital costs. This is possible because the nuclear properties of 233U are such that it
can be used in thermal reactors more efficiently than in fast reactors.

Although the strategy analyses presented in Chapter 6 considered various advanced
converters as potential dispersed denatured reactors, the selection of an optimum advanced
converter is precluded at this time due to cost and performance uncertainties and the
failure of this study to identify a single advanced converter for further development on
the basis of commonly accepted selection criteria. For example, at high Uj0g prices, the
HTGR appears to generate the lowest-cost power of the thermal reactors, while an HWR
appears to be the most resource-efficient and to have the best energy-support ratio on
the denatured cycle. The SSCR might be developed most quickly and cheaply. All the
advanced converters, but particularly the HWR and the HTGR, appear to have certain
superior fuel utilization characteristics relative to standard LWRs due to their higher
conversion ratios (i.e., lower 233U makeup requirements), lower fissile inventories, and
Tower Pu production. Denatured advanced converters also can be sustained at higher support
ratios than can denatured LWRs. [Cycles with potentially higher thermal efficiencies (such
as the direct cycle) and potential siting advantages were not considered in the comparisons
of the advanced converters. ]

The introduction of denatured advanced converters, however, is estimated to require
up to $2 billion more research, development, and demonstration expenditures than would
the introduction of a denatured LWR. Moreover, a denatured LWR could be commercialized
up to 10 years sooner than a denatured advanced converter. Developing a denatured LWR
would be less difficult due to the backlog of LWR experience and the reduced risk
associated with a previously demonstrated reactor system. The capital cost of an advanced
converter, although generally Tower than the cost of a fast reactor, is estimated to be
somewhat higher than that of an LWR. Thus, the improved performance must be weighed
against the increased capital costs, the delay in introduction, and the research and
development costs in any decision relative to the use of advanced converters in con-
junction with the denatured cycle.

The analysis of Chapter 6 indicates that, as 233 producers, fast transmuters would
have more favorable resource characteristics than thermal transmuters. For the energy
demand assumed in this study, the most satisfactory denatured power system would consist of
denatured thermal reactors coupled to fast transmuters in a symbiotic relationship, the
logical transmuter candidate being a fast reactor with (Pu-U)0, drivers and ThO, blankets.
It should be noted, however, that a more rapid growth in energy demand could dictate that
Pu/U breeders be constructed to meet the demand or that some combination of Pu cycle
breeders containing thorium and dispersed denatured breeders be used. In these cases the
nuclear power capacity could grow independent of the resource base.

Although the denatured cycle appears to possess advantages relative to the Pu/U
cycle, several important areas require further study. In particular, the refinement of
the denatured advanced converter characterization is of prime importance, both to evaluate
various reactor options and to study the overall use of advanced converters as opposed to
LWRs. As the potential for improving the performance of LWRs, both on the once-through

 
 

 

 

7-48

and recycle modes, is better defined and as advanced converter designs are optimized for
denatured systems, the analysis will become more useful for R,D&D planning. Also, system
interaction studies for the dispersed denatured reactors and centralized transmuters
require refinement based on improved reactor designs and updated mass balances. Finally,

the question of implementing the energy-center concept, together with the use of specially

designed transmuters as a source of denatured fuel, deserves more detailed study. The
Nonproliferation Alternative Systems Assessment Program (NASAP) is currently developing
characterizations of improved fast transmuters, improved LWRs, and reoptimized advanced
converters and LMFBRs. Light Water Breeder Reactors (LWBRs) will also be included in
these characterization studies.

7.5.3. Overall Conclusions and Recommendations

The denatured 233U cycle emerges from this assessment as a potential alternative
to the conventional Pu/U cycle. Its advantages may be characterized as follows:

e The denatured 233y cycle offers proliferation-resistance advantages relative
to the Pu/U cycle in that the "fresh" denatured fuel has an isotopic barrier;
that is, it does not contain chemically separable Pu or highly enriched uranium.
By contrast, the Pu/U cycle together with fast breeder reactors tends toward
an equilibrium with all reactors using Pu fuels. Also, fresh denatured fuel
has a much more intense radioactive barrier than does the fresh fuel of the
classical Pu/U cycle.

eo For moderate growth rate scenarios, deployment of power systems that include
reactors operating on denatured 233U fuel would allow a larger fraction of
the reactors in a power system to be thermal reactors. This would tend to
minimize the overall capital costs of the system compared to fast/thermal
power systems based on the Pu/U cycle.

eo If in addition to LWRs, the denatured thermal reactors of the power system
were to include denatured advanced converters, the dependence of the power
system on a fast reactor component (i.e., fast transmuters) could be further
minimized due to the improved resource utilization of denatured advanced
converters compared to denatured LWRs. Although the advanced converters
would have higher capital costs than the LWRs, this might be offset by
reduced requirements for FBRs.

The disadvantages of the cycle are the following:
e The denatured 23% fuel cycle is more complex than the Pu/U cycle, and since

"233 must be produced in transmuter reactors, the rate at which denatured 233y
reactors can be introduced will be inherently limited. Because the Pu/U cycle

technology is closer to commercialization, there is a reluctance both by
U.S. industry and by foreign governments to embrace an alternative which
is less developed and which is considered primarily on the basis of its

onproliferation advantages, and this would have to be overcome.

The R,D&D costs for developing the denatured 233U fuel cycle are significantly
higher than those for the Pu/U cycle. If advanced converters must also be
developed, significant additional costs would be incurred.

Other important conclusions from this study are as follows:

On the

The once-through cycle based on LWRs is likely to dominate nuclear power
production through the year 2000. This provides time to develop either
the denatured cycle or the Pu/U cycle for the recycle mode.

The denatured 233y fuel cycle can be used in LWRs, SSCRs, HWRs, HTGRs,
and FBRs without major changes from the present conceptual reactor designs
based on their reference fuels.

After the necessary R,D&D is completed, the denatured 233 fuel cycle
appears to be economically competitive with the Pu/U fuel cycle in LWRs,
advanced converters, and in symbiotic fast-thermal recycle systems.

With the fuel resources assumed, the nuclear power demand postulated in this
study (350 GWe in the year 2000 and a net increase of 15 GWe/yr thereafter)
can be met as well by the denatured fuel cycle as it can by the Pu/U cycle.
However, the Pu/U-FBR cycle has an inherent ability to grow at a faster rate
than the other cycles.

basis of this study, it is recommended that:

Optimized designs of alternate breeders, improved LWRs, HWRs, SSCRs, and
HTGRs be examined to refine the characteristics of the denatured cycle
relative to fuel utilization, economics and energy-support ratio. The
study should also be expanded to include LWBRs and the fast breeder
designs developed by DOE in the Proliferation Resistant Large Core
Design Study (PRLCDS). More detailed assessments of the proliferation
risks and the economics of the denatured cycles compared to other
recycle options (Pu/U and HEU/Th) should also be pursued.

 
 

 

 

7-50

These studies could provide guidance for the following R&D programs:

Thorium fuel cycle R&D to investigate the use of MEU(235)/Th, MEU(233)/Th
(denatured 2330), and Pu/Th fuels in LWRs and HWRs (the latter in cooperation
with Canada). This program might also include the LWBR fuel cycle.

Studies to consider denatured 233U or 235 fuels as candidates for the
HTGR reference fuel cycle.

Thorium technology studies, particularly for blanket assemblies, as an
integral part of the FBR programs (LMFBRs and GCFBRs).

Exploratory work with utilities and PWR and BWR vendors for qualification
and use of MEU/Th and Th fuel rods in commercial reactors. An example of
the beneficial use of Th would be in corner rods of the BWR fuel assembly.

Appendix A. ISOTOPE SEPARATION TECHNOLOGIES

E. H. Gift
Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant

A.1. Current Separation Capability

Three enrichment technologies exist that are sufficiently advanced to be classi-
fied as current separation technology. These are:
a. The Gaseous Diffusion process.
b. The Gas Centrifuge process.
c. The Becker Separation Nozzle process (and its variant, the South African Helikon
process).

Both the centrifuge and the Becker processes are expected to provide enrichment
services that are competitive with gaseous diffusion. The centrifuge process, in parti-
cular, is projected to provide a 30%! saving in separative work cost when fully imple-
mented in a large scale plant.

A brief description of each of these processes and their current productive
capacity follows.

The Gaseous Diffusion Process?

The gaseous diffusion process is based upon the physical fact that in a gas made
up of molecules of different masses, molecules containing the lighter mass isotopes will,
as a result of the distribution of kinetic energies, have average velocities slightly
faster than those which contain the heavier isotopes. As a result, these lighter isotopes
will reach the walls or pores in the walls of a containment vessel more frequently and at
higher velocities. In the gaseous diffusion process, the container wall is a porous tube
(barrier) through which diffusion is accomplished.

The maximum theoretical separation that can be achieved is a function of the
square root of the ratio of the masses of the gas molecules. In the diffusion process,
utilizing uranium hexafluoride, the square root of the ratio is 1.00429. Because this
number is so close to unity, the degree of enrichment which can be achieved in a single
diffusion stage is very small, but the effect can be multiplied by making use of a
cascade consisting of a number of stages. Production of 90 weight percent 235 from
0.711 weight percent 2350 material, as found in natural ore, requires about 3,000
diffusion stages in series. A plant constructed for the purpose of producing material
of up to 4.0 weight percent 235U, as might be required for typical light water power
reactors, would contain about 1200 stages.
 

 

 

To take advantage of the small separation factor discussed above, diffusive flow
must be ensured, not just simple gas flow. Diffusive flow requires not only small pores,
j.e., less than two-millionths of an inch in diameter, but also uniformity of pore size.
Because of the small pore size, literally acres of barrier surface are required in a large
production plant.

Complexity of plant design is increased by the difficulties arising from the
nature of the diffusing gas itself. A volatile compound of uranium must be used, and
the hexafluoride (UFg) is the only known suitable compound. It is a solid at room
temperature; consequently, the diffusion plants must be operated at temperatures and
pressures necessary to maintain the UFg in gaseous form. Although it is a stable com-
pound, UF is extremely reactive with water, very corrosive to most common metals, and
not compatible with organics such as lubricating oils. This chemical activity dictates
the use of metals such as nickel and aluminum and means that the entire cascade must
be leak-tight and clean. The corrosiveness of the process gas also imposes added diffi-
culties in the fabrication of a barrier which must maintain its separative quality over
long periods of time.

The enrichment stage is the basic unit of the gaseous diffusion process. In all
stages gas is introduced as UFg and made to flow along the inside of the barrier tube.
In the standard case about one-half the gas diffuses through the barrier and is fed to
the next higher stage; the remaining undiffused portion is recycled to the next lower
stage. The diffused stream is slightly enriched with respect to 2350, and the stream
which has not been diffused is depleted to the same degree.

The basic equipment components vital to the process are the axial flow compressors,
the converter shell and the barrier tubes. Axial flow compressors are used to compress
the UFg gas to maintain the interstage flow, and electric motors are used to drive the

compressors.

A gas cooler is provided in the converter since gas compression unavoidably
generates heat which must be removed at each stage. The diffuser, or converter, is the
large cylindrical vessel which contains the barrier material. It is arranged in such a
fashion that the diffused stream and the stream that has not diffused are kept separate.

Groups of stages are coupled to make up operating units and such groups, in turn,
make up the cascade.

Gaseous diffusion plants are in operation in the United States, England, France,
and Russia.

The Gas Centrifuge Process

The countercurrent gas centrifuge separation of uranium isotopes is based on
processes developed more or less independently in the U.S. at the University of Virginia,
in Germany,* and in Russia® during World War II. Much of this work was reported at the
1958 Geneva Conference. In the U.S. this work was continued at the University of
Virginia and reported in 1960.6 The machine developed is shown in Fig. A-1.

3

The theory":7 for operation of the gas centrifuge shows that the maximum separative
capacity of a gas centrifuge is proportional to:
a. The fourth power of the peripheral speed,
b. the length, and
¢. the square of the difference in molecular weights.

Thus, it is evident that one should make the peripheral speed and the length of the
centrifuge as large as possible. The peripheral speed is limited by the bursting strength
of the material of the rotor wall. A long rotor of small diameter is comparatively

flexible and will pass through a series of resonant mechanical vibration frequencies while
being accelerated to high peripheral speed. Unless provided with special damping bearings,
a centrifuge would destroy itself while passing through one of these resonant speeds. Much
of the world's effort in advanced centrifuge development has been designed to keep below

the first resonant frequency. As a result, they are comparatively short and have relatively
low separative capacity.

Some of the differences between gas centrifuge and gaseous diffusion technologies
should perhaps be noted. Gaseous diffusion requires fabrication of permeable barriers
with a very small pore size; the manufacture of these barriers is a difficult process
and a closely guarded secret. . Gas centrifugation requires manufacture of high-speed
rotating equipment. While such manufacture is certainly not trivial, it basically
requires a well-equipped precision machine shop that may well be within the technical
capabilities of many nations. The technology of rotating machinery is widespread and
designs for gas centrifuges are in the open literature.

The power requirements for a centrifuge facility are much less than for a
diffusion facility of the same size. For U.S. plants of economic scale and of the same
separative capacity, gas centrifugation requires about 7% of the power needed for gaseous
diffusion. 8 oo

oo Following the early work in the U.S., further research on the centrifuge process
was undertaken for the USAEC by the University of Virginia, Union Carbide Corporation |
Nuclear Division and Garrett Corporation-AiResearch Manufacturing Co., and Dr. Lars
Onsager. The current status of the U.S. program can best be indicated by a brief
description of the operating and planned facilities:!

The Equipment Test Facility (ETF) was conceived to provide for the reliability
testing of "high capacity" centrifuges. This facility, which began operation in 1971,
has been the source of reliability testing for two generations of machine designs. Many
of the first generation high capacity machines are still operating in this facility.

The Component Preparation Laboratories (CPL) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee and Torrance,
California, were built to evaluate, improve and demonstrate techniques amenable to the
mass production for manufacturing centrifuges. This facility became operational in
early 1974.

The Component Test Facility (CTF) was designed to demonstrate the machine reli-
ability and operability testing of substantial numbers of centrifuges in a cascade
operation. Construction was begun in 1972 and the first phase of startup of the facility
was completed in January 1977 with cascade operation of about one-half of the machines
operating. The remaining machines were operable within a few weeks later. The capacity
of the CTF is significant, about 50,000 SWU/yr, or about the annual enriching requirement
for a 500 MW power reactor.

The Advanced Equipment Test Facility (AETF), in addition to being a reliability
test facility will also test the plant subsystems which support the machines. The
machines to be installed in this facility will have significantly greater separative
work capability than those in the CTF. The AETF is expected to be operable in the spring
of 1978.

In Europe, the URENCO organization, consisting of participants from England,
Germany, and Holland, has a program that so far has been directed toward machine reli-
ability and long lifetime. URENCO is currently producing about 200 MTSWU/yr from
plants at Almelo, Holland and Capenhurst, England. Expansion of these facilities is
planned by 1982. The URENCO group expects to have 2000 MTSWU/yr in operation, 1300
MTSWU/yr at Almelo, and the remaining 700 MTSWU/yr at Capenhurst.

The Becker Separation Nozzle

The Becker process,? being developed in Germany by Dr. E. W. Becker and his
associates, utilizes the pressure gradient developed in a curved expanding supersonic jet
to achieve separation in a gas mixture. The separation nozzle stage is shown schematically
in Fig. A-2. A light gas, helium or hydrogen, is added to the UF; in order to increase
the velocity of the jet. As the expanding jet traverses the curved path, the heavier
component is enriched in the vicinity of the wall. A knife edge divides the jet into two
fractions--one enriched in the light component, and the other enriched in the heavy

.component--which are then pumped off separately from the stage. Although the separation

obtained per stage is relatively high (1.025), many separation nozzle stages are needed
to obtain an appreciable enrichment. This process avoids the problems associated with
the fine-pored membrane required for gaseous diffusion, and those associated with the
high-speed rotating parts of the gas centrifuge. It does suffer, however, from the
disadvantage of a relatively high power requirement, primarily because a great deal of
light gas must be recompressed between stages along with the UFg process gas.

A small 10-stage pilot plant was operated in 1967 to prove the technical feasi-
bility of the process. Following that, a single large prototype stage suitable for use
in a practical cascade was fabricated.

A prototype separation stage contains 81 separating elements and is reported to
have a separative capacity of approximately 2000 kg U SW/yr. A plant producing a product
enriched to 3% 235U and with tails at 0.26% 235U is expected to require about 450 such
stages.

Figure A-3 shows the individual separating elements, each containing 10 separation
nozzle slits on its periphery. The fabrication of these units is not as simple as one
might at first expect. In order to obtain the desired separation performance at reasonable
pressures, it is necessary to employ very small geometries. The spacing between the knife
edge and the curved wall in the prototype separating unit should be about 0.0005 of an
inch. In order to obtain good performance, it is necessary that this spacing not deviate
by more than £10% over the 6-foot length of slit.

The power requirement for the Becker process is currently estimated to be about
one and one-third times as great as that required for gaseous diffusion. Dr. Becker
believes that further process improvement is still possible and that the power require-
ment can be substantially reduced.

Fig. A-3. Becker Separating Element With Ten Slits

The South African Helikon Process

 

The South Africanl® {or UCOR) process is of an aerodynamic type whose separating
element is described by the developers as a high-performance stationary-walled centri-
fuge using UFg in hydrogen as process fluid. All process pressures throughout the system
will be above atmospheric and, depending on the type of "centrifuge" used, the maximum
process pressure will be in a range of up to 6 bar. The UF; partial pressure will,
however, be sufficiently low to eliminate the need for process heating during plant
operation, and the maximum temperature at the compressor delivery will not exceed 75°C.

The process is characterized by a high separation factor over the element, namely
from 1.025 to 1.030, depending on economic considerations. - Furthermore, it has a high
degree of asymmetry with respect to the UFg flow in the enriched and depleted streams,
which emerge at different pressures. The feed-to-enriched streams pressure ratio is
typically 1.5, whereas the feed-to-depleted streams pressure ratio is typically only 1.12.

To deal with the small UF cut, a new cascade technique was developed--the so-called
"helikon" technique, based on the principle that an axial flow compressor can simul-
taneously transmit several streams of different isotopic composition without there being °
significant mixing between them. The UCOR process must, therefore, be regarded as a
combination of the separation element and this technique, which makes it possible to
achieve the desired enrichment with a relatively small number of large separation units
by fully utilizing the high separation factor available. A further feature of the helikon
 

 

 

A-10

technique is that a module, defined as a separation unit consisting of one set of com-
pressors and one set of separation elements, does not as in the classic case, produce only
one separation factor of enrichment in one pass but can produce for a constant separative
work capacity various degrees of enrichment up to a maximum of several times the separation
factor over the element.

Full scale modules of this type are nearing the prototype stage. Recent design
jmprovements are expected to result in a nominal capacity of 80 to 90 kg SWU/yr!! per
separation module.

A valuable feature of a plant based on this process is its very low uranium inven-
tory, which results in a short cascade equilibrium time, of the order of 16 hours for a
commercial plant enriching uranium to 3% 235u,

The theoretical lower limit to the specific energy consumption of the separation
element can be shown to be about 0.30 MW.h/kg SW. The minimum figure observed by the
developers with laboratory separating elements is about 1.80 MW.h/kg SW, based on
adiabatic compression and ignoring all system inefficiencies. This difference is a
measure of the improvement potential expected by the South Africans.

Current and Projected Enrichment Capacity

Most of the known installed enrichment capacity is based upon gaseous diffusion
technology. Only small increments of centrifuge technology are in operation (i.e.,
URENCO, Japan and U.S.)}, and one plant utilizing modified nozzle technology (the South
African Helikon plant) may be operating. Indicative of the status of other isotope
separation methods, all planned additions to the world enrichment capacity are based on
either diffusion, centrifuge or nozzle technology.

The existing worldwide capacity and planned additions to capacity are shown in
Table A-1 by country and technology type. In the table the groups identified as
Eurodif and Coredif are multinational organizations building gaseous diffusion plants
in France.

A.2. New Separation Technologies

In addition to the more developed technologies (gaseous diffusion, gas centri-
fuge, and the Becker nozzle), there are several other separation methods that either
have been utilized in the past or are currently being developed. These technologies

. are listed in Table A-2.

The discarded technologies listed in Table A-2 have been used to produce
enriched uranium.

A large-scale, liquid-phase, thermal-diffusion plant was constructed in 1945
by the Manhattan Project.l% This plant produced very slightly enriched uranium
(0.86%). Thermal diffusion is impractical for commercial enrichment of uranium
isotopes because of its very high energy requirements. Compared to gaseous diffusion,
the energy requirement is over 200 times greater.

The electromagnetic or Calutron methods were used during the Manhattan Project
to produce highly enriched uranium.l* The process was discarded shortly after the
more economical gaseous diffusion plant began operation. A brief description of the
process follows.

The Calutron Process involved the vaporization of a salt feed material,
typically UCl,, from an electrically heated charge bottle through slots into an arc
chamber where the salt was ionized by an electron beam which travels along the lines
of flux of the magnet. The ionized uranium, as the ut ion for the most part, passed
through another slot where it was accelerated by other slotted electrodes into the
vacuum tank which filled the pole area of a large electromagnet. The ions from the
accelerating electrodes diverged several degrees from the slots and at the 90° point
passed by some baffles as a rather thick beam. This beam was brought to a focus at the
slots of a receiver system as curved lines by the shimmed magnetic field. In the
large units, 96-in. beam diameter, there were up to four of these beams in a given
tank. The divergent trajectories of the ions from the four sources intersected some
few degrees from the accelerating electrodes and separated as distinct beams, again a
similar distance from the receivers. There were various side beams of vert, ut, and
other ions which hit the baffles and the walls of the tank at a series of locations.
The uranium content of these beams condensed as various compounds of uranium. The
product was, for the most part, converted to UC by interaction of the very high
voltage uranium ions with the graphite of the receivers. Since, in even the most

efficient of the units developed, only about 22% of the feed was collected as product
in a vaporization cycle of the feed, there were large amounts of uranium compounds to
be recovered and recycled through the system. The chemical operations required were
complex, but the amount of space and the number of workers required in the chemical
function were always small compared to the requirements of the rest of the process.
The processing of the receivers to recover the product uranium was a small scale

but very demanding series of chemical procedures,

The developing technologies listed in Table A-2 offer no current capability
for producing kilogram quantities of enriched uranium. If any of them approaches
commercial feasibility, they may provide enhanced opportunities for a clandestine
enrichment operation. A brief description of each of these processes follows.

Photoexcitation (Laser) Methods

 

The development of high intensity narrow-frequency tunable lasers has raised
the possibility of nearly complete isotopic separation in a single step. Thus,
reactor grade and perhaps even weapons grade uranium could be produced in one pass
through the apparatus. Such a single-stage process would allow for a much more compact
enrichment plant, saving land area, capital investment and power consumption.
These hopes have led to active research and development programs in the United States,
the Soviet Union, Israel, France and possibly other countries.

In the U.S. the development of laser enrichment is being pursued along two
distinct lines. One line of development uses atomic uranium vapor as the source
material for the laser excitation whereas the other line of development is pursuing
excitation of molecular uranium hexafluoride. Each method has its virtues and
defects.

Laser Enrichment with Atoms.!5 In the atomic. enrichment process most often
discussed, molten uranium is heated in an oven to about 2500°K. The atomic vapor
emerges in the form of a long, thin ribbon into a highly evacuated region where it
is illuminated by two visible or near-ultraviolet lasers. One laser is tuned to
a transition from the ground state of uranium to“an excited state roughly halfway up
the ladder to ionization. This is the isotopically selective step, and it is hoped
that very high selectivities will be achieved here.

 

The purpose of the second laser is to boost the excited 235U atoms to a level
just below the ionization limit. This step need not be isotopically selective, and
in principle the second laser could be used to ionize the atom directly. But ioniza-
tion cross sections are generally about 1000 times smaller than resonant excitation
cross sections, and so it is far more efficient to use a resonant transition to excite
the atom to a state just below the ionization level and then to use either a static

electric field or an infrared laser pulse to pull the electrons off the atoms. Once
the atoms are ionized, they can be separated from the neutral atoms in the beam by
the use of electric or magnetic fields, or both.

The major limiting factor in the above process is the density of atoms in the
uranium "ribbon." There is an upper limit on the density and therefore on the rate
of production of enriched uranium, because both excitation energy and ionic charge are
very easily transferred to other atoms in collisions. Such collisions must be kept to
a minimum if a high selectivity is to be obtained.

Other technical difficulties in the development of the process are:

a. The corrosiveness of the uranium vapor.
The presence of thermally excited or ionized atoms of 235U in the uranium vapor
(at 2500°K, ~55% of 235) atoms are not in the ground state).

c. The potential for self lasing of the uranium vapor.

d. Thermal ionization of 2380 will seriously degrade the selectivity and thus
limit the enrichment.

e. Lasers combining high energy density, rapid pulse repetition rate, high tuning
precision, and long-term stability and reliability must be developed.

Laser Enrichment with Molecules.!S Gaseous UFg is used in all proposed schemes
for molecular enrichment, since this is the only compound of uranium with a sizable
vapor pressure at reasonable temperatures. Because the molecule contains seven atoms
and exhibits a high degree of symmetry, it produces a complicated spectrum of
vibrational and rotational excitations. The most interesting vibrational modes from
the point of view of laser excitations are those which involve motion of the uranium
atom and which therefore produce an oscillating electric dipole moment. Only these
modes are likely to produce transitions from the ground state when excited by elec-
tromagnetic energy.

 

The low energies associated with these transitions lead to two serious
problems for laser enrichment in UF. The first problem is the creation of an
infrared laser with the correct frequency. The second problem is related to the
high occupation numbers of the low-energy vibrational states at temperatures where
UF has a high vapor pressure. Because so many low-lying states are occupied, it
is impossible to find a single excitation frequency that will be absorbed by most
of the molecules. The presence of these so-called "hot bands" reduces the efficiency
of the process very drastically.

The second problem is easily solved, at least in principle, if warm UF; gas
is passed through a supersonic nozzle. The effect of the expansion is to convert
most of the kinetic energy of random motion of the gas in the reservoir into kinetic
energy of translational motion of the gas in the nozzle. As the gas accelerates

through the nozzle, it becomes colder and the energy stored in the vibrational
and rotational degrees of freedom of the molecules is reduced by intermolecular
collisions in the narrow region just downstream of the slit. The molecules can
now be illuminated by a laser beam which has been tuned to excite selectively
molecules containing 235U.

This technique yields the first step in the molecular isotope separation
process; however, this selective excitation does not provide a way of segregating
the excited molecules. To do this, considerably more laser energy must be absorbed
by the molecules to get them to dissociate to 235UF; and fluorine. In theory, this
energy can be provided by either an infrared or an ultraviolet laser.

Since it is not necessary for either of these secondary processes to be
isotopically selective, the primary demands on the ultraviolet or infrared lasers are
related to their energy output and pulse repetition rates. In both cases considerably
higher powers are required for the molecular than for the atomic processes because
much larger numbers of molecules can be processed in the same period of time. This
high power requirement follows because the density restrictions apparently are
less severe for molecules than for atoms.

The dissociated product must still be physically separated from the undissociated
material and substantial recombination could occur if the recombination probabilities
for UFs and F are high. ‘

As with the atomic process, the molecular process must also overcome formidable

technical difficulties before it becomes a feasible production process. Some

of these obstacles are:

a. The high probability of resonant vibrational energy exchange between the 235UFg
and the 238yFg,

b. The recombination of dissociated molecules.

Cc. An infrared high-powered laser tunable to the required wave length for the primary
excitation must be invented. . Co ~ : Co

d. The secondary laser must satisfy the combined demand of high pulse energy, rapid
repetition rate and high efficiency.

e. The rapid and efficient separation of the dissociated product from the depleted
tails.

 

‘Chemical Exchange Methods

The use of a chemical exchange system to separate metal isotopes has been under
investigation in the U.S. for several years. In addition to work in the U.S., the
French recently have made allusions to similar research. It has been shown that calcium

 
 

 

A-16

isotope enrichment can be accomplished using a simple extraction process involving
the relatively new class of compounds known as polyethers. Work is underway to
determine whether a similar process could be used for uranium isotope enrichment.

The electron exchange equilibrium between U(IV) and U(VI) may result in a
significant isotope enrichment. The extraction of a single uranium cation without a
valence change yields a small isotope effect which by itself would have no practical
use. Combining the two processes leads to a potentially economic process for uranium
isotope enrichment. :

The electron exchange reaction which occurs in the aqueous phase can be
described by Equation 1:

2354+ 3 2380, 2+ 2384+ 4 235)p,2+ Tm

This reaction was reported to have an a = 1.0014 with 238U concentrating on the U(IV)
ion. The solvent extraction exchange reaction of the U(VI) ion can be described by
Equation 2: ) o

235)0,2+ 238 2380, 2+ 235

Although the a for Equation 2 is unknown, theory and experience predict that 238y
will concentrate in the aqueous phase. The constructive nature of the two processes
might, therefore, be expected to result in an o suitably large to be the basis of a
uranium isotope enrichment process.

From a chemical standpoint, several problems immediately appear as critical
ones. Obviously, one needs an extractant which will separate U(IV) and U{VI). It
must operate under some very specific conditions set by other portions of the system.
In order to form the basis of a useful process, the electron exchange reaction in
Equation 1 must have a half-time, ty, on the order of a few seconds. Also, the exchange
reaction shown in Equation 2 must be rapid. Both these reactions must, therefore, be
well understood. Finally, it must be demonstrated that a sufficiently large a exists
under these conditions. i

Based on these exchange reactions and based on a reasonable value of o (between
1.0014 and 1.002), countercurrent liquid extractors can be set up into a cascade
arrangement. Further assuming that the exchange reactions and the a are independent
of the relative concentrations of 235U and 238, estimates of the equilibrium time to
achieve 3% enrichment range from approximately three months to one year. To achieve
90% enrichment, the equilibrium time may range from 3 to 30 years.

Aerodynamic Methods

Both the separation nozzle and the stationary-walled centrifuge can be
classed as aerodynamic processes. These are considered to be competitive processes
by their proponents and plans for their implementation are well advanced. Research
efforts have been directed at several other aerodynamic methods such as the vortex
tube, the separation probe, crossed beams, velocity slip and the jet membrane. None
of these appear at the present time to offer the promise of the two aforementioned
aerodynamic processes, although an expanded effort is proceeding on the jet membrane
process. Commonly known as the Muntz-Hamel process, it involves the penetration of
a stream of UFg gas into an expanding jet of easily condensible carrier gas. The
Tighter 235UF; molecules penetrate the jet more easily than the heavier 238UF,
molecules. A tube placed on the axis of the jet collects the enriched UF;. The
depleted UFg flows out of the other end of the scattering chamber, after the carrier
gas is separated from it by condensation.

Plasma-Based Processes

Since a plasma can be made to rotate at speeds greater than that of an ultra-
centrifuge, it occurred to various investigators that such high speed gas rotation
without the use of revolving equipment might possibly be developed into a more
efficient isotope separation process than that based on a mechanical centrifuge.

Five papers on this topic were presented at the International Conference on Uranium
Isotope Separation in London in March 1975. The authors' assessment of the prospects
for such a process ran the gamut from highly optimistic--technology is simple and well
known so that minimal development will be required--to pessimistic--a rotating plasma
process cannot possibly be economically competitive. To our knowledge, no one has
separated uranium isotopes by means of the plasma centrifuge.

Since that time, several other plasma-based processes have been proposed. Of
all these processes, the currently most feasible seems to be the Plasma Ion Enrichment
process (the Dawson separation process). In this process a plasma of UFg (or of
uranium atoms) within a strong uniform magnetic field is exposed to a low energy
radio-frequency wave resonant with the cyclotron frequency of the 235UF; ions. The
rotation thereby imparted preferentially to the 235UF; ions enables the 235 to be
separated from the 238) by properly placed collection plates.

This method has been used successfully to enrich macroscopic. samples of po-
tassium. 16 The collector was a cooled tungsten ribbon having a voltage bias to
collect selectively the excited ions. The potassium vapor was contact ionized at
the entrance to the mass spectrometer. To eliminate spurious effects, samples were
collected under three conditions of rf excitation: (1) no rf; (2) excitation at the
39K cyclotron frequency; and (3) excitation at the *!K cyclotron frequency. The

resulting ratios of 41K/39K abundance as measured by the mass spectrometer were,
respectively, 0.07 (the natural abundance), 0.02 and 4. The abundance ratio of 4
corresponds to a more than tenfold enrichment of “1K.

In addition to potassium ions, work has been done on neon, argon, xenon and
uranium toward resolving the ion cyclotron resonances for individual positive ions.

The work with uranium is proceeding toward estimates of realistic operating parameters
(ion densities, magnetic field strength, isotopic excitation energies, device length,

ion temperatures, and collector types).

A second process involves the achievement of a UFg plasma by chemi-ionization.

UF molecules are accelerated by expansion with an inert carrier gas through a
supersonic jet. A cross beam of alkali metal molecules results in the formation of
NA* or Cs* and UFg~. A radio-frequency quadrupole mass filter deflects the 238UFg
out of the plasma beam, permitting the separation of the two isotopes by collection
of the two beams on separate baffles cooled by liquid nitrogen. This process seems
to have less potential than the first.

Comparison of Advanced Separation Processes

The estimated costs of the processes mentioned are compared in Table A-3
with that of gaseous diffusion. With two exceptions, the table is based on process
evaluations made by the Nuclear Division of the Union Carbide Corporation!’ for
ERDA. For the exceptions, which are the FRG's separation nozzle and South Africa's
stationary-walled centrifuge, the comparison is based on published statements by the
developers of the process. Of all the processes listed, only the costs for the
centrifuge, and possibly for the separation nozzle, are known with any degree
of certainty.

The economic data base used in the assessment of the impact of denatured fuel cycles in
the various nuclear systems options described in Chapter 6 was jointly developed by Combustion
Engineering, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, United Engineers and Constructors, Argonne
National Laboratory, Resource Planning Associates, Hanford Engineering Development Laboratory,
DOE Division of Uranium Resources and Enrichment, and DOE Division of Nuclear Research and
Applications. The data base includes capital costs, operation and maintenance costs, fuel
fabrication and reprocessing costs, capacity factors, money costs, and uncertainties.

The deflated and present-valued capital costs for LWRs, SSCRs, HTGRs, CANDUs, and FBRs,
excluding interest during construction, are shown in Table B-1. The same capital costs
including interest during construction are shown in Table B-2. In either case, the stream of
expenses incurred during the construction of the plant is discounted to the date of startup
and is measured in dollars of constant purchasing power. The uncertainty ranges included in
Table B-2 represent current best estimates of the most probable variations in capital costs.
For flexibility, the uncertainties are expressed relative to the reference LWR capital cost.

The fuel fabrication costs for the various reactor types are shown in Table B-5 as a
function of time beginning with the expected introduction date for a particular reactor and
fuel design. ~ If a particular reactor and fuel design should prove successful, fabrication
costs should decrease as larger plants with higher throughput rates are constructed. The
decrease in fabrication costs over the first decade after introduction is simply indicative
of a transition from small fabrication plants with high unit costs to larger fabrication
plants with lower unit costs. These costs are a strong function of the fissile isotope and
a weak function of the fertile isotope. The sensitivity to the fissile isotope is caused
either by the spontaneous fission associated with high-exposure fissile plutonium or by the
gamma activity associated with high-exposure 233), The costs are based on the assumption
that fuels containing 235U are fabricated on a line with contact operation and contact
maintenance, fuels containing fissile plutonium are fabricated on a line with remote
operation and contact maintenance, and fuels containing 233 are fabricated on a line with
both remote operation and remote maintenance. The expected variations in fuel fabrication
costs (cost uncertainties given in footnote b of Table B-5) represent the upper and lower -
cost boundaries anticipated for fabrication costs and are expressed as percentages. For
example, the expected fabrication cost for plutonium-bearing LWR fuel with uncertainties
applied ranges from $306 per kg HM (-10% of reference) to $510 per kg HM (450% of reference)
for year 2001 and beyond. ”

assumed to have been stored, with the

spent fuel stockpile being reduced in an
orderly manner after the advent of repro-
cessing. After the spent fuel stockpile

has been reduced to zero, the out-of-reactor
time required for reprocessing and refab-
rication is assumed to be two years.

The long-run marginal costs estimated
for U30g ore as a function of the cumulative
supply are shown in Table B-7. As noted in
Chapter 6, the U30g estimates have been
provided by DOE's Division of Uranium
Resources and Enrichment (URE), the high-
cost supply being based on the assumption
that approximately 2.5 million tons of U304
will be available from conventional uranium
ore resources and the intermediate-~cost
supply being based on the assumption that
approximately 4.5 million tons of Uj0g
will be available. In either case, it is
assumed that shales can be mined after the
conventional resources are depleted. The
cost of extracting the shales increases
from $125/1b to $240/1b for the high-cost
supply case and from $100/1b to $180/1b
for the intermediate-cost supply case. It
is important to note that the long-run
marginal costs shown in Table B-7 are larger
than the forward costs shown in Table 6.1-1
of Chapter 6 because the long-run marginal
costs contain the capital cost of facilities
currently in operation, plus a normal profit
for the.industry. The long-run marginal
costs are more appropriate for use in a
nuclear strategy analysis.

The enrichment costs and tails
compositions assuming either a continuation
of the gaseous diffusion technology or the
deployment of an advanced enrichment tech-

.. nology are shown in Table B-8. It was

assumed that if the gaseous diffusion
technology is continued the tails composi-
tion will be stabilized at 0.0020 and that
the cost of enrichment will increase to
$80/SWU in 1987 and remain constant there-
after. If an advanced enrichment technology

is deployed, the tails composition would decrease continuously from 0.0020 to 0.0010 between
the years 1980 and 2000 as the installed capacity of the advanced technology increased, and
the cost of a unit of separative work would decrease to approximately 60% of that of the
gaseous diffusion process, It was also assumed that the tails composition would further
decrease from 0.0010 to 0.0005 between the years 2001 and 2030 due to improvements in
technology, while the cost of a unit of enrichment would remain constant during this period.
The tails composition and enrichment cost were assumed to remain constant thereafter.

The capacity factors of a plant throughout its 30-yr lifetime are shown in Table B-9.
The capacity factor increases from 60% to 72% during the first 3 yr of operation and remains
at 72% during the subsequent 14 yr. It then decreases continuously as the forced outage
rate increases and as the plant is shifted from a base-load unit to an intermediate-load unit.

The long-term real cost of money to the electric utility industry is shown in Table B-10.
These costs were developed by analyzing the deflated cost of debt and equity to the industry
over the past 30 yr. The long-term deflated cost of debt has been 2.5%/yr and the long-term
deflated cost of equity has been 7.0%/yr. Assuming the industry to be funded at approximately
55% debt and 45% equity, the long-term real money cost is approximately 4.5%/yr.

The combined effects of capital, fuel fabrication, and reprocessing (or permanent
disposal) cost uncertainties on the levelized total power costs for individual reactor and
fuel cycle options are shown in Fig. B-1. These costs represent typical nonfuel components
whose uncertainties are easily quantified. Figures B-2a and B-2b show the relationship of
total power costs to the Ui0g price for four reactors on the throwaway fuel cycle. The
sensitivity of the total power costs to the U30g price was analyzed first by assuming that
the price remained constant over the 30-yr life of the reactor, and second by assuming that
‘the price increases in relation to the rate of consumption (see Fig. B-3). Thus, the total
power costs in Fig. B-2b are given for a reactor starting up with the U;0g price shown on

the abscissa. The major difference between the two methods of analysis is the U30g price at
which reactor options incur the same total power cost. For example, whereas at a constant
Ug price the PWR and HWR options have the same power generation cost at ~ $160/1b Ui0s
for an increasing Us0g price they have the same cost at ~ $130/1b U0s.

From the data shown in Fig. B-1 it is clear that the total power cost for each reactor
and fuel cycle option is dominated by uncertainties. The uncertainty effect produces a
* significant overlap between reactor power costs. In addition, it is evident from Fig. B-2
that fuel costs, viz., Uj0g prices, also significantly affect not only the levelized power
costs but also the competitive relationship between reactor options. Therefore, it is
difficult to classify reactors as either more economical or less economical based solely on
power generation cost estimates.

Appendix C. DETAILED RESULTS FROM EVALUATIONS OF VARIOUS NUCLEAR
POWER SYSTEMS UTILIZING DENATURED FUEL

M. R. Shay, D. R. Haffner, W. E. Black, T. M. Helm,
W. G. Jolly, R. W. Hardie, and R, P. Omberg
Hanford Engineering Development Laboratory

This appendix presents detailed results from the calculations performed for the
economic/resource evaluation of denatured nuclear reactors operated in concert with other
reactors to form nuclear-based power generation systems. For purposes of comparison, it
also presents results for similar systems that do not utilize denatured fuel.

As pointed out in Chapter 6, nine different nuclear policy options were examined with
four cases under each option. The resulting cases can be classified as shown in Table C-1,
where the letters L, S, G, and H indicate the thermal converter option employed in each case.
For all cases identified with an L, the only converters used are LWRs. For cases identified
with an 5, SSCR converters are used in addition to LWRs. Similarly, for cases identified
with H and G, the converters used are HWRs and HTGRs respectively, both again in combination
with LWRs. Under Options 3, 6, 7, and 8, FBRs are also included in the nuclear systems.
In addition to these 36 cases, Case 1L was recalculated for a standard LWR alone; that is,
the LWR with an extended discharge exposure, which is included in Case 1L, was eliminated
from the system. This case is identified in this appendix as Case 1E.

In all cases the reactors operating on plutonium or on highly enriched uranium were
assumed to be restricted to secure energy centers, while those operating on Jow-enriched,
slightly enriched, natural, or denatured uranium were permitted to operate outside the
centers. The specific reactors used for each case, and their locations, are given in
Table 6.1-5 of Chapter 6.

An cases were run assuming 350 GWe of installed nuclear capacity in the year 2000
and a net increase in installed capacity of 15 GWe per year thereafter. Each new plant was
assumed to have a 30-yr lifetime. For Option 1, some additional cases were run for a lower
energy demand -- 200 GWe in the year 2000 and a net increase of 10 GWe per year thereafter.
These latter cases are identified with a C following the case number (i.e., cases 1LEC, 1LC,

etc.).

In the results presented here, particular emphasis is given to uranium utilization,
separative work utilization, and energy-support ratios. Two important criteria are to be
considered when analyzing uranium utilization of reactor systems. The first is the ability
of the system to meet the specified nuclear energy demand with the available U30g supply.

For these calculations two different supplies were assumed: 3 million and 6 million ST below
$160/1b U30g, corresponding to a high-cost and an intermediate-cost supply, respectively.

(As shown in Appendix D, nuclear power plants do not compete well at higher U30g costs.)

The second criterion is the capability of the uranium industry to discover, mine and mill the
ore at a rate adequate to satisfy the demand for uranium. The specification of the overall
maximum production rate is difficult to postulate because of the possibility of importing
Us0g and because of the difficulties that might be encountered in developing uncertain
resources. As pointed out in Section 7.4.4 of Chapter 7, the DOE Uranium and Enrichment
Division has estimated that by developing known and potential reserves domestic mining and
milling could sustain 60,000 ST of U30g per year.

When analyzing enrichment utilization, the same two criteria - total amount and enrich-
ment capacity - were also used, the more meaningful being the capacity since enrichment is
not a limited natural resource like uranium.

For the cases in which 3 million ST of uranium below $160/1b U30g was assumed, the
lack of low-cost U30g dominates the plant selection because the amount of ore available is
inadequate for meeting the projected nuclear energy demand. As a result, resource-efficient
reactors are constructed regardless of their cost. With a U30g supply below $160/1b as
large as. 6 million ST, however, most systems are no longer dominated by the lack of U30g,
and the relative total power costs of the individual reactors play a more important role.

In fact, if the system is not limited in any way by the supply of Uj0g, then the solution is
determined solely by economics. The results in this case become more tenuous because of the
uncertainty in capital costs, fabrication costs, reprocessing costs, etc.

The cumulative nuclear capacities that could be constructed through the year 2050
for the various cases are shown in Table C-2. Only those cases totaling 1959 GWe will have

met the projected nuclear demand under the criteria of an installed capacity of 350 GWe in
year 2000 and an increase of 15 GWe per year thereafter.* With the high-cost U30g supply

some of the systems fall far short of satisfying the demand; in fact, the only nuclear systems
that fully meet the demand are those including FBRs (Options 3, 6, 7, and 8). The throwaway
option, in particular, builds less than a third of the desired nuclear plants. Of the cases
that do not include FBRs, those employing HWRs come closest to meeting the demand. One HTGR
case (2G) is also clearly superior to most of the other cases. This is to be expected since
Case 2G includes traditional HTGRs that are fueled with highly enriched 235U and also with
233y/Th. : : - E } Lo

A doubling of the economic U30g supply to 6 million tons allows many more nuclear
system options to meet the projected ‘nuclear energy demand. In fact, only the throwaway
option has cases that don't even come close to satisfying the demand. None of the Option 4

‘cases meet the demand either; however, Cases 4S and 4H are within 16 GWe of the demand.
© A11 other systems have at least one. advanced converter option that builds the desired

1959 GWe of energy. It should be emphasized that for the systems where the demand was met
with the high-cost U30g (i.e., the systems with FBRs), a doubling of the ore supply means

that the ore supply is no longer the sole constraint and plant selection is based on economics.

*NOTE: = Since this is a 50-year span, some of the reactors built in the first few years
will have been decommissioned after having operated 30 years.

Uranium and enrichment utilization for the various cases are shown in Table C-3. The
uranium utilization values are the total amount of uranium consumed plus the forward commit-
ment per GWe of nuclear power constructed through the year 2050. The enrichment utilization
values are the total amount of separative work units required through the year 2050.

As pointed out above, for the cases for which only 3 million ST U30g was assumed to
be available below $160/1b, the ore is the limiting factor. Comparing Case ILE with Case 1L
gives the savings in ore on the throwaway cycle as a result of introducing the extended
exposure LWR -- less than 4% in ore and none in enrichment. .Cases 1L, 1S, 1H, and 1G
compare the relative ore and enrichment utilization of the various advanced converter options

on the throwaway cycle. The HWRs clearly offer the greatest savings in both ore and

enrichment. Compared with LWRs, the HWRs reduce ore requirements by over 10% and SWU
requirements by almost 30%. In contrast, the SSCRs only offer a 2% ore savings and an 8%
enrichment savings. The HTGRs reduce the ore usage by less than 2%, with about the same
enrichment requirements. The impact on ore utilization of the SSCR, HWR, and HTGR advanced
converters on the throwaway cycle is ‘less than might be expected. The reason for the minimal
effect is because most of the 3 million ST of U30g has already been committed to LWRs

before enough advanced converters can be built to have much influence.

Allowing the recycle of fuel in thermal reactors (Option 2) results in significant
savings in ore compared to the throwaway cycle ~-- almost 60% for the HTGRs and from 30 to
40% for the other converters. For this nuclear policy option and the high-cost U;0g supply,
the HTGR clearly has the best ore utilization, although the HWRs have better enrichment
utilization.

The introduction of the classical Pu-U/U FBR in Option 3 results in an additional ore
and enrichment savings of about a factor of two from that in Option 2 except for the HTGRs.
Note, however, that in Option 2 the HTGRs already had a low ore and enrichment usage. In
Option 3 all the advanced converter cases have about the same usage.

Recycling uranium in denatured reactors and throwing the plutonium away (Option 4)
requires enrichment about halfway between Options 1 and 2. Compared with the classical
recycle of plutonium in thermal reactors (Option 2), Option 4 consumes roughly the same
quantity of uranium with LWRs and SSCRs. That is, the increased worth of 233U in LWRs and
SSCRs is nearly balanced by throwing away the plutonium. The requirements for HWRs, however,
are considerably reduced over those of Option 2 when 233) is recycled compared to recycling plu-
tonium. The very low fissile requirements for the denatured 233U HWRs is responsible for the
more favorable U30g utilization in Option 4 compared to Option 2. In contrast, the HTGRs in
Option 4 Took much worse than in Option 2. This is because the HTGRs were already operating
on the 233U/Th cycle in Option 2. However, in Option 2 the uranium-fueled reactors all use
highly enriched fuel while in Option 4 they use denatured fuel.

Options 5U and 5T allow the recycle of plutonium in plutonium/thorium transmuters,
the difference between the two being that denatured 235U reactors are available in 5U whereas
they are not in 5T. This forces the 5T system to initially rely on the Pu/Th-fueled reactors
for 233y, Compared to Option 4, Option 5U results in 20 to 25% savings in ore usage and
Option 5T in 10 to 15% savings. The HWRs are the most efficient advanced converters for
uranium and enrichment utilization for Options 5U and 5T.

Option 6 introduces FBRs with thorium blankets, although these FBRs have uranium as
fertile material in the core. Comparing Option 6 with Option 3 reveals that both systems
have approximately the same resource utilization. Option 7 is identical to Option 6 except
the denatured 233U FBR is included. The impact of this reactor on resource utilization for
these cases is small.

In Option 8 the Pu-U-fueled FBRs of Option 7 are replaced with Pu-Th-fueled FBRs. The
longer doubling time of this reactor type results in somewhat increased uranium and enrichment
requirements. ‘A key point for all of the systems containing FBRs (Options 3, 6, 7, and 8)
is that the ore and enrichment usage is relatively independent of the advanced converter
option. This is in contrast to the nonbreeder systems where the type of advanced converter
available (LWR, SSCR, HWR, or HTGR) much more strongly affects the resource utilization.

Another very important point that needs emphasis is that the superior ore utilization
of the HWRs relative to the other advanced converters for the alternate fueled systems
(Options 4 - 8) is directly dependent on the denatured 233U-fueled HWR. Of all the reactor
designs, the design of alternate fueled HWRs have probably received the least amount of analy-

sis and therefore have the largest uncertainty. Thus, before it can be concluded that the
HWRs offer significant resource savings, more work needs to be performed to verify the

optimistic performance characteristics of the denatured 233U-fueled HWR.

Since 6 million ST of U;04 below $160/1b is adequate, or nearly adequate, to satisfy
the projected nuclear energy demand for most cases in the various nuclear options, the
power growth patterns for these cases are strongly influenced by economics as-well as
resource utilization. Thus, as mentioned earlier in this appendix, the results for the
cases based on the intermediate-cost U30g supply are subject to much larger errors because
of large cost uncertainties. Table C-3 shows that the advanced converters for the throw-
away cycle reflect a larger U30g savings when 6 million ST dis used as a base rather than
3 million ST. This is because many more nuclear plants -are built with the larger supply
and therefore more advanced converters can be built, resulting in a larger impact. For .
the high-cost U30g case, most of the economic U30g was already committed to the LWR before
the advanced. converters could have an effect.

- For Option 2, the results are about the same for both U;0g supplies except for the
case with HTGRs (Case 2G). Ore requirements per GWe are 27% higher for this case with the
intermediate-cost U0; assumed to be available. This is because 6 million ST of economic
Us0g is an adequate amount of ore for the system of reactors in Case 2G to satisfy the
nuclear energy demand and economic considerations are also affecting the mix of reactors
that are built. Thus, the fraction of low-enriched LWRs constructed is larger because
this reactor is less expensive than the HTGRs, even though the HTGRs use less. uranium.

The plant selection for the cases that include FBRs (Options 3, 6, 7, and 8) -is also
determined by economics when 6 million ST of U30g5 below $160/1b ‘is assumed to be available.
Therefore, the uranium utilization for these cases has less meaning. Similarly, some of
the advanced converter options for the denatured cases (Options 4, 5U, and 5T) are resource
limited and some are not, so it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding relative uranium
and enrichment utilization.

To summarize, there are two important and competing effects when comparing the cases
for the two uranium supplies: (1) For systems that fall far short of meeting the demand
with the high-cost U3;0g supply, the larger supply allows the advanced converters to have a
greater impact and therefore better ore utilization; and (2) systems that have almost
enough ore with the high-cost U30g supply have plenty of ore with the intermediate-cost-
supply, and therefore plant selection with the larger supply is based on cost and ore
utilization is lower.

The maximum annual U30g requirements and the maximum annual enrichment requirements
through the year 2050 are shown in Table C-4, The number in parentheses next to each maximum
indicates the year the maximum occurs. As was mentioned above, it has been estimated that
the maximum domestic mining and milling rate may be approximately 60,000 ST/yr. Table C-4
indicates that if the high-cost U30g supply is assumed, the annual U30g requirements vary

from 50,000 ST/yr (Case 7S) to 80,000 ST/yr (Case 4L).. For most.of the cases, the maximum

occurs during the first decade of the next century. Thus, most of the cases require annual
ore usage within the next 25 - 30 years that exceeds the 60,000/yr criterion.

*System with standard LWR only.

The maximum annual separative work requirements based on the high-cost U30g supply
varies from 34 million SWU/yr to 69 million SWU/yr. This means that the current separa-
tions capacity would have to be doubled or quadrupled to meet the demand. As expected,
the year in which the maximum separative work capacity occurs is nearly the same as the
year when the U30g demand is greatest.

Assuming the intermediate-cost U30g supply, the maximum annual ore requirements are
greater than 60,000 ST for all cases. For most of the options, the year the maximum occurs
is 40 yr later than for the high-cost cases. This is because, with 6 million ST of economic
U30g, the nuclear industry continues to expand. The breeder reactor systems that include
HWRs (Cases 3H, 6H, 7H, and 8H) are the only cases that have ore requirements that are
close to being as low as 60,000 ST/yr. The maximum separative work requirements are also
very high for this uranium supply -- from 42 to 100 million SWU/yr.

Table C-5 shows the energy support ratios calculated in this study for the year 2025,
the energy support ratio being the ratio of installed nuclear capacity outside the energy

centers to the installed nuclear capacity inside the centers. All the reactor types that
are available in Options 1 and 4 could be constructed outside the centers; therefore, the

energy support ratio for each case in these options is =». However, it has already been
shown that these systems offer the lowest uranium utilization and therefore the lowest

nuclear growth potential, even if it is assumed that 6 million ST of U30g is available at
below $160/1b.

*System with standard LWR only,

As pointed out previously, with only 3 million ST of U;0g available below $160/1b,
the only systems that satisfy the energy demand of 350 GWe in the year 2000 and 15 GWe/yr
thereafter are those with breeders. The disadvantage of the classical Pu-U breeder cycle
(Option 3), of course, is the low energy support ratio since the plutonium that is produced
must be used in the energy centers. One technique for increasing the energy support ratio
is to load thorium in the blanket of these breeders, while retaining plutonium and uranium
in the cores. The 233U that is produced in the blankets is then burned in denatured LWRs
located outside the centers (Option 6). The resulting energy support ratios for Option 6
vary from 1 to 2, depending upon the advanced converter option. Option 7 introduces a
denatured FBR which would provide 233U to the system and therefore should increase its
nuclear growth potential. However, since Option 6 can meet the projected nuclear growth
demand itself, the addition of the denatured breeder in Option 7 actually had a minimal
impact.

The energy support ratios of Options 6 and 7 could be further increased by replacing
the uranium in the core of the Pu-U breeder with thorium (Option 8). With the high-cost
U30g supply, energy support ratios of about 3 are obtained for this system. The intro-
duction of thorium in the core of a breeder lowers the breeding ratio to the point that,
in contrast to Option 7, significant quantities of FBRs operating on denatured fuel must be
built to meet the projected nuclear growth demand.

In general, the energy support ratio trends for the various options are the same if
6 million tons of U30g is available below $160/1b; however, they are significantly higher,
largely because more low-eniriched LWRs can be built.

Selected detailed results for all the cases calculated are presented in Table C-6,
C-7, and C-8. While many of the numbers in these tables appear elsewhere in this report,
many numbers are also shown for the first time. For example, the plant mix in year 2025
and the levelized power cost for each plant starting up in the year 2025 are shown. The purpose
of these tables is to group all the data together and also to provide sufficient data to
help explain the behavior of the various reactor systems. (Note: Cases ILT and ILTM in
Table C-6 are for changing enrichment compositions; see Section 6.2-1 in Chapter 6.)

Appendix D. CALCULATIONS OF NUCLEAR AND FOSSIL PLANT COMPETITION
BASED ON ECONOMICS

M. R. Shay, D. R. Haffner, W. E. Black, T. M. Helm,
W. G. Jolly, R. W. Hardie, and R. P. Omberg
Hanford Engineering Development Laboratory

In a series of calculations that preceded those reported in Chapter 6 for nuclear
power systems, the same analytical model was used to evaluate power systems that include
both nuclear power plants and coal-fired power plants, with the two types of plants being
in economic competition. As was stated in Chapter 6, the results of these calculations
indicated that at Us0g prices above $160/1b, nuclear power plants do not compete well for
the assumptions used in this study. Therefore, for the all-nuclear systems it was decided
to limit the uranium resources to those available at prices below $160/1b.

This appendix describes the initial set of calculations. The nuclear plants used
were LWRs, with and without recycle, and they correspond to Cases 1L, 2L,....8L in Chap-
ter 6. The primary differences between the calculations presented in Chapter 6 (and in
Appendix C) and the calculations described here are as follows:

(1) Instead of a nuclear energy growth projection, a total electrical energy growth

projection was used.

(2) In addition to nuclear plants, coal plants were available to satisfy the total
electrical energy demand.

(3) No price constraint on ore existed. Instead it was assumed that additional
uranium ore was always available at increasingly higher costs. As with the all-nuclear
systems, two different U30g price structures were used.

(4) Power plant selection was based on economics instead of Uj0g utilization.

The electrical energy demand that was used for these calculations is shown in
Table D-1.. This projected demand assumes a 5.6% per year growth rate until 1980, and a
5.1% per year growth rate from 1980 to 1990. The growth rate decreases each decade until
year 2030, after which a constant 2.5% per year growth rate is assumed.

The marginal cost of uranium as a function of the cumulative quantity mined was
shown in Table B-7 of Appendix B. In this appendix cases that use the high-cost uranium
supply are denoted as cases 1L, 2L, ..., while cases that use the intermediate-cost uranium
supply are denoted as cases 1LU, 2LU,.... As has already been emphasized, it was assumed
for these calculations that the quantity of available uranium was unlimited. The only

 
 

restriction on uranium consumption was

1980 2.51 5.1 coal regions. The principal differences
1990 41 4.1 between coal plant types are the coal price,
2000 | 6.1) 3.5 the coal energy content, and the size of
2010 8.6, 3.0 the demand that can be satisfied by each
2020 1.6 2.5 coal plant type. The maximum fraction of
2030 14.9 the total electrical energy demand that can

be satisfied by each regional coal plant
type is shown in Table D-2. ' This table

 

also gives the heat content of the coal for each region.

The capital cost associated with building a coal plant was assumed to be 12% lower
than the capital cost of a LWR, or $550/kWe (in 1/1/77 dollars). Therefore, for nuclear
plants to be built instead of coal plants, the fuel costs of the nuclear plants must be

enough lower than the fuel cost of fossil plants to override this capital cost differential.

If nuclear plants are less expensive than coal plants for all regions, then all of the new
plants built will be nuclear. Figure D-1 shows how the nuclear market fraction decreases
as nuclear plants become more expensive. If nuclear plants increase in price by 20% over
the price where all of the market would be nuclear, the nuclear market fraction decreases
to 0.75. An increase of about 35% in the price of a nuclear unit reduces the nuclear
market fraction to about 0.34, while a 57% increase results in all of the new plants built

being fossil-fueled plants.

Nuclear power growth projections for the LWR on the throwaway cycle are shown for
both uranium supplies in Fig. D-2a. For the high-cost uranium supply case, nuclear power
peaks at 500 GWe of installed capacity around the year 2005 and then phases out to about
100 GWe in 2040. On the other hand, if the intermediate-cost uranium supply is assumed,
nuclear power continues to grow until about 2015 to almost 900 GWe, and then decreases to
about 300 GWe in 2040. As a result, nuclear is more competitive with coal and captures a

larger share of the market.

Figure D-2b shows that recycling plutonium in LWRs (Case 2L) increases the nuclear
power market even more than the assumption of a larger uranium supply, and introducing
the Pu/U-fueled FBR with recycle (Case 3L) further increases the nuclear market to 1300
GWe of installed nuclear capacity in the year 2040. The Ui 0g utilization, defined as the

total U40g consumed plus committed per

GWe of nuclear power constructed through
the year 2050, is also given for these
cases. As noted, recycling plutonium in
LWRs reduces U30g usage by 38% per GWe,
while introducing the FBR results in a 62%
reduction.

With the intermediate-cost Uj0g
supply, 1300 GWe for the FBR case becomes
almost 1800 GWe in 2040 (see Case 3LU in
Fig. D-2c). The nuclear power peak for
each of the ore supplies occurs around
the year 2040, although the installed
nuclear capacity is very flat at this
point.

The disadvantage of classical
plutonium recycle in FBRs is demonstrated
in Fig. D -2d for Case 3L. Here the two
Pu-fueled reactors are inside the energy
center and the LEU-LWR is outside the

center. It can be seen that after about 2020, the ratio of reactors that can be located
outside the center to those inside is less than unity and rapidly decreasing. In fact, as

the system becomes less and’ less dependent upon uranium ore and more and more upon
plutonium, the energy support ratio will approach zero.

The denatured fuel cycle Cases 4L, 51,” and 6L are compared with the throwaway cycle
in Fig. D-2e. Nuclear market penetration for plutonium throwaway (Case 4L) is not sub-
stantially greater than for the throwaway cycle (Case 1L). The peak penetration is about
630 GWe of installed nuclear capacity versus 500 GWe for the throwaway cycle. However,
if the plutonium is utilized in an LWR Pu/Th converter (Case 5L), the maximum nuclear
penetration is 1000 GWe, which is a factor of two greater than for the throwaway cycle
and, furthermore, the peak does not occur until more than 10 years later. Introduction
of the FBR with a Pu-U core and thorium blankets (Case 6L) results in a peak penetration
of 1250 GWe in about 2025. After 2025, the nuclear market fraction is constant because
the system is essentially independent of uranium, which is becoming increasingly more
expensive.

With respect to U30g utilization, Fig. D-2e shows that the Pu/Th converter case has
slightly better ore utilization (by 7%) than classical plutonium recycle in LWRs (Case 2L
in Fig. D-2b). Furthermore, plutonium "transmutation" in Pu-U FBRs also has better U30g
utilization (by 12%) than classical plutonium recycle in FBRs (compare Cases 3L and 6L).

The reason for these trends is that the 233U fuel that is being bred is worth more as a fuel
in thermal reactors than the plutonium that is being destroyed.

The effect of a larger uranium supply on the market penetration for converters and
FRBs that produce 233 is shown in Figs. D-2f and D-2g. For both cases (5 and 6), the
large uranium supply increased the maximum nuclear penetration by about 450 GWe. Case 7L
introduced a denatured 233U-fueled FBR to the 6L case, and Case 8L is identical to Case
7L except that the FBR with a Pu-U core is replaced with an FBR with a Pu-Th core. The
maximum nuclear penetration for Cases 7L and 8L are compared with 6L in Fig. D-2h. The
denatured 233-fueled FBR doesn't have any impact because this reactor is competing with
less expensive 233U-fueled LWRs and therefore isn't built. The nuclear market penetration
for Case 8L is seen to decrease after about 2020. This is because the neutronics
properties of FBRs fueled with Pu-Th are degraded significantly from those fueled with
Pu-U. As a result, the doubling time of these reactors is longer and the cost is higher.
The degraded neutronics of the Pu-Th FBRs are reflected in the U30g utilization of Case’
8L where the ore usage per GWe is almost 50% higher than for Case 6L.

The objective in building FRBs with Pu-Th cores is to increase the 233% production
and therefore the ratio of reactors located outside the energy center to those inside the

 

*

The nuclear reactors that are available in Case 5L with nuclear-fossil competition are
similar to Case 5UL described in the other sections of this report. However, in 5L the
denatured 235U-fueled LWR isn't built because of economics. Therefore, the solution
more closely resembles Case 5TL.

energy center. It can be seen from the nuclear power growth patterns for Cases 6L and
8L, shown in Figs. D-2i and D-2j, that the energy support ratio for Case 8L is higher.
The degraded neutronics of the FBRs fueled with Pu-Th are reflected in the U;0g utilization

of Case 8L where the ore usage per GWe is almost 50% higher than for Case 6L (see Fig.
D-2h). However, for most years the total amount of energy that is available to be built
in the energy centers is about the same for Case 8L as it is for Case 6L because the
total amount of nuclear energy is lower.

Key selected results from the nuclear-fossil competition calculations are presented
in Tables D-3 and D-4 for high-cost and intermediate-cost U30g supplies respectively.
Each table presents the cumulative capacity of nuclear and fossil plants built through
year 2050, the total system costs, the annual coal consumption in 2025, data on uranium
and enrichment utilization, the installed capacity of each reactor type in year 2026, and
the levelized power cost of each reactor type for a reactor starting up in year 2025. The
most striking conclusion that can be drawn from the comparison of levelized power costs of
each reactor type is that there isn't a large difference. The reason, of course, is that
the total amount of uranium consumed doesn't vary much from case to case because when
uranium becomes expensive, fossil plants are constructed in place of nuclear plants. This
point is demonstrated in Table D-5, which shows the time behavior of the Uj0g price. It
can be seen from this table that the differences in the price of U30g for the different
nuclear systems are not large.
