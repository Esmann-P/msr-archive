SUBJECT: MSRE ~ Analog Computer Simulation of the
System With a Servo Controller

TO: Ge A. Cristy

FROM: 0. W. Burke

ABSTRACT

One purpose of this study was to determine whether the fuel salt

F~ temperature inside the reactor could be controlled with a closed-
loop servo controller. An "on-off" type controller was demonstrated
using four different control signals. The stability of the system

/ when using the controller was of primary interest.

These studies indicated that the system was stable for large and
relatively fast power demand changes when using the controller with
any one of the four control signals.

Introduction: It is desirable to provide a controlier for con-
trolling the fuel temperature inside the reactor. There are many
control conceptg that would do the job.

 

The decision was made to try a simple "on-off" controller. E. R.
Mann of the Instrumentation and Controls Division proposed four
control signals which have definite possibilities and suggested
that they be demonstrated on the analog computer. This report
covers the analog computer demonstrations.

Description of the System Simulated: A schematic flow sheet of the

MSRE system is shown in Figure 1, The temperature symbols are identi-
fied in Figure 2. The design information used in these studies is listed
in Figure 3. The analog computer diagram is filed in the Engineering and
Mechanical Division print files on Drawings 40331 and L0332.

 

The simulation of the thermal system and nuclear system as used in these
studies has been discussed in previous preliminary reports.~ There were
two changes, however, that were significant. The temperature coefficient
of reactivity of the graphite was changed from:

2x10" dk to -6x10° Sk
K-OF K-°F

and the total secondary salt Loop transit time was changed from 13
seconds to 24.2 seconds.

Description of Controller: The controller simulated was a simple
"on-off" servo controller. The rod drive motor was a constant speed
motor, driving the rods at a constant velocity sufficient to change
the reactivity at a rate of:

 

0002 OK
K-sec.

For the sake of simplicity, the rod worth was considered to be linear
throughout the range used in these studies. The "time constant” of the
controller was assumed to be 50 milliseconds. This "time constant" is the
time required for the rod speed to attain 63% of full speed subsequent to
receiving a demand signal to move the rods. The "dead band" of the con-
troller was I 20F,

Description of the Control Signals Used: The four different control
signals used with the above described controller were as follows:

 

A. Control Signal No. 1,&,

 

The equation expressing € is as follows:

STITT er 4a 1)
where,
G = control signal gain factor or amplification factor.
m, n, and a are coastants that may be varied at will.

d = neutron flux

 

To = Fuel salt temperature at the reactor outlet.

Tr
Ti] = Fuel salt temperature at the inlet to the reactor.

r t
g(t) = WN - (x] - 1) - g +] dt

r r
0 Lo.

This can be considered as a "reset mechanism." = gyri S70
Tsp - The desired mean fuel temperature in the reactor.

The controlled variable in €, is the mean fuel temperature in the

reactor, z, + J » This variable appears only in the
r Tr

 

2

second term of the control signal. If this term alone is used as
the control signal, the system 1s unstable.

The first term in €, can be considered as a high frequency band
pass stabilizing mechanism. It merely compares the rate of pro-
duction of nuclear power to the rate of addition of heat to the
fuel salt as it passes through the reactor. Note that for steady
state operation:

d_Le(l=o =A, |= 9 (2, - i] ) a(t) _
g(t) =a ¢ - (=. - ])

This insures that the first term in € will be zero for steady state
operation whether the term:

be (- e)]

is zero or not. For this reason, the constant, "a", does not have

to be reset for various power levels. eC exceeds the dead band

-) =
positively, rods will be inserted and if €, exceeds the dead band
negatively, rods will be withdrawn. The analog computer diagram
used to obtain € is shown in Figure 4.

The temperature sensing elements are thermocouples attached tc the
walls of the pipes containing the fluids whose temperatures are to

be measured. There is a time lag between the time at which a change
in temperature of the fluid occurs and the time at which this change
is reflected in the thermocouple output signal. This time lag varies
with different thermocouple designs, pipe wall thicknesses, etc. The
time constant for this lag in the salt temperature thermocouples was
designated as T and was considered to be 5 seconds.

-

«= % #
® on Goo Ko
i

The time constant of the g(t) circuit was, chosen ast 10 times that
of the thermocouple. This longtime constant was necessary in order
to get "reset action" and still not interfere with the stabilizing
effect during transients.

The other three control signals are quite similar to €, and only
their differences from, will be pointed out in the following
descriptions of these signals.

Control Signal No. 2, &, o

 

The equation expressing € is as follows:

= €,° md a § - (2), - ] ) g(t) p+ n Gc] 1] Fen,

where,

f, = air flow rate across the radiator

TI = outlet air temperature from radiator
Ja

I, = inlet air temperature to radiator
J a

 

The time constant used for the alr temperature sensing elements
was 2.5 seconds and that used in the g(t) circuit was 25 seconds

(T3= 2.5and A), = 0.04).

Note that the controlled variable is the same as for €, » The
stabilizing portion of the control signal is now formed by comparing
the rate of production of power in the reactor to the rate of re-
moval of power from the secondary salt by the alr flowing across

the radiator. Note that a multiplier is required in this circuit.

The controlled variable is the same as that in €, and €, » The
stabilizing circuit is formed by comparing the rate of power production
in the reactor to the rate of power loss of the secondary salt as it
flows through the radiator. No multiplier is required since the flow
rate in the secondary salt system is constant.

The "time constant" potentiometer settings are the same as those used
in €, . The analog computer diagram used to obtain €, is shown in
Figure 6.

The equation describing €

This control signal is the same as ) except that a different con-
trolled variable is used. The outlet fuel temperature from the
reactor is the controlled variable. The analog computer diagram
used to derive, is shown in Figure 7.

Procedure and Results: The system without a controller was shown to be
unstable subsequent to any appreciable perturbation. The system was also
shown to be unstable when using the controller with only the second term
in the above control signals.

 

The stability of the system with the gbove controllers was checked sub-
sequent to large changes in the power demand or load. The changes in the
load for the four runs, each using one of the four above described control
signals to the controller, were not precisely equal in magnitude and rate
of change. The change in load was accomplished by manually turning a
potentiometer. Also, no attempt was made to get optimum settings for M
and N in each case. Therefore, the results cannot be compared quantita-
tively. In later runs linear ramp load changes will be used, and optimum

- 6 -
values of M and N used, so that wortrollers can be compared. Records
ings of the controlled variable and the neutron flux were made subssgquent
to a load change, while using each of the four control signals to the
controller. The conditions for these runs were ag follows:

A. Using €, as the control signal, M, as shown on the computer
diagram, wag set at 877 (quite arbitrarily) and N was set at
0.5. The load, or the heat removal Fate by the air across the
radiator, was cet at approximately 4 megawatt and the system
permitted to stabilize. The load was increased from 5 mw to
10 mw in 15 seconds, approximately at a constant rate. The
curves obtained are shown in Figure 8. On all the curves only
a relatively short time is shown. It can be seen that the curves
are converging, which indicates stability.

B. Using €, as the control signal, M, as shown on the computer
diagram, was set at 0.877 and N set at 0.5. The load was changed
from approximately 1.6 mw to 10 mw.in 17 seconds. The resulting
curves are shown in Figure 9.

C. Using € as the coatrsl signal, M, as shown on tha computer
diagram, was set at 0.25 and N was set at 0.5. The load was
changed from approximately 1.6 mw to 10 mw in 13 seconds. The
resulting curves are shown in Figure 10.

De Using c 4 88 the control signal, M, as shown on the computer
diagram, was set at 0.50 and N was set at 1.00. The ioad was
changed from approximately 1.6 mw to 10 mw in 11 seconds. The
resulting curves are shown in Figure 11.

The conclusion reached wag that the system would be stable using the con-
troller with any of the four control signals.

It should be pointed out that th= congtants M and N on the actual in-
stallation could be changed ov=r a considerable range. No attempt was
made to get the optimum settings on the computer, due to time limitations.
