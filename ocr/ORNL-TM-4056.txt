ABSTRACT

The equilibrium of dilute UF3-UF, molten fluoride solutions
in contact with graphite and UCj:

3UF, + UC, z 4UF, + 2C
has been studied as a function of temperature (370-700°C), melt com-
position and atmospheric contamination. Equilibrium quotients, Q =
(UF3) 4/ (ur, 3 for the reaction were determined by measuring the UF 3
and UF, concentrations spectrophotometrically. The solvents used
were primarily LiF-BeF2 mixtures. Results from this solvent system
were related to the reactor solvents LiF-BeF9-ZrF,(65.6-29.4-5 mole
%) and LiF-BeF)-ThF,4(72-16-12 mole %). It has been found that the
equilibrium quotient is very sensitive to both temperature and sol-
vent changes increasing as either the temperature increases or the
alkali-metal fluoride content of the solvent decreases.

 

INTRODUCTION

The relative stability of dilute UF3-UF, molten fluoride solutions
contained in graphite is of practical importance to Molten Salt Breeder
Reactors, MSBR, in which these solutions are used as nuclear fuels. Be-
cause the reactors contain a large amount of graphite in the core serving

as a neutron moderator, reaction of UFy with graphite:

*
4UF 5 4) + 2C Z 3UF, (4) + uc, (1-1)

to form UF, and uranium dicarbide has long been recognized: as a major
factor limiting the amount of UF3 which can be maintained in solution.

Although typical fuel mixtures consist essentially of 1 mole % uv’ r,

or less in a solution of LiF and BeF,, the ease of UF, reduction to UF, by

**Hastelloy N, a nickel-based alloy containing Cr, Fe and Mo has been
used? to fabricate the metal containment vessel for the Molten Salt
Reactor Experiment, MSRE.
necessitates the consideration of UF5 chemistry as well. The effect of the
corrosion reaction of Eq. 1-2 is to leach chromium from the structural

metal and cause it to appear in solution as CrFj.

In order to minimize the corrosion, the equilibrium of Eq. 1-2 is
shifted to the left by reducing a small percentage (approximately 1%) of
the UF, to UFj3 through the addition of beryllium metal:

2UF + Be® 2 2UF + BeF (1-3)

4(d) 3(d) 2
Although a small amount of UF3 is beneficial in reversing the corrosion
mechanism, it produces complications due to possible reaction via Eq. 1-1
and the resulting undesirable formation of an insoluble uranium carbide.
Reference to "UFj stability" in this paper will therefore mean specifically
the equilibrium concentration of UFj3 relative to UF, as determined by Eq.

1-1.

This equilibrium has never been experimentally measured despite the
fact that it is the major factor in determining UF3 stability for molten
salt reactor systems. Although they used indirect means, Long and
Blankenship? are the only investigators who have attempted to measure the
equilibrium. Since their work is the basis on which all previous estimates
of UF3 stability have been made, it will be reviewed in detail, with the
equilibrium expressions in fractional coefficients as used by the authors.
They studied the reduction of UF, (both pure solid phase UF, and in molten

fluoride solution) with hydrogen:

by measuring HF and H, ratios evolved from a reaction vessel containing

constants, KR, for the reduction. These, combined with the equilibrium
R . . so. os

quotient, Q , for the dilute solutions and the activity coefficient for

UF 3, YUF 3» obtained from solubility data, enabled them to calculate the
activity coefficient for UF,, YUF,,» in the molten fluoride solution. By
combining the free energy expression for Eq. 1-4 with one for the decompo-

sition of UF3 into UF, and u°:

-> 3 lo -

they obtained an expression for the equilibrium quotient, Q°, of Eq. 1-6,

in terms of the equilibrium quotient for Eq. 1-4, ok, and the activity co-
efficients of UF, and HF. (c.f. p 18, Ref. 4, part II). Using free ener-
gies of formation for UC) and UC from Rand and Kubachewski, > which were
acceptable at the time, they estimated uranium activities in the carbides
and concluded that solutions in which up to 60% of the initial 1 mole 7% of
UF, is converted to UFy are expected to be stable in the presence of graph-
ite. In addition they concluded that temperature and solvent changes

should have little effect on the equilibrium mechanism of Eq. 1-1 since they
found no significant effect from them on the Hy reduction mechanism of Eq.

1-4,

In view of the significance of Eq. 1-1 to Molten Salt Reactor Technol-
ogy, a closer examination of it is clearly warranted. The development of
spectrophotometric techniques for the study of molten fluorides and the
realization of solvent effects on molten fluoride chemistry, have given
impetus to the study. We have already identified’ UC), as the stable uran-
ium carbide phase in equilibrium with UF3-UF, solutions in graphite. The
object of this report is to describe the effects of temperature, solvent,
and atmospheric contamination on the equilibrium. Both the forward and the
back reaction of Eq. 1-1 in the reference solvent system LiF-BeF, have been
followed. The data in the reference solvent system have been related to
practical reactor solvents such as the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment, MSRE,
solvent, LiF-BeF,-ZrF, (65.6-29.4-5 mole %) and the proposed Molten Salt
Breeder Reactor, MSBR, solvent, LiF-BeFy-ThF, (72-16-12 mole %). Our find-
ings are compared with earlier observations which have not been reviewed

before.
EXPERIMENTAL

Equilibrium quotients for the back-reaction* (Eq. 3-2) were determined
by measuring UF3 and UF, concentrations spectrophotometrically with a Cary
Model 14-H recording spectrometer. The sample system consisted of a control-
led temperature, inert atmosphere furnace shown in Fig. 2-1 which held a
diamond-windowed graphite spectrophotometric cell.’ Molten fluoride salt
solutions and reagent uranium carbides were contained in this cell. Ab-
sorption spectra of the molten salt solution were measured against an air

reference. Net spectra due to UF, and UF, were determined by subtracting

independently determined solvent lank spectra using standard digital com-
puter techniques. Spectra were measured in the near infra-red and visible
regions from 4000 to 33000 em™l. The absorption spectra of UFg5 and UF,

served as the primary means of monitoring these components in solution as a

function of temperature, time, and solvent composition.

Materials - Molten salt solvent compositions were prepared by mixing
calculated amounts of the pure component fluoride salts. Optical quality
crystal fragments from the Harshaw Chemical Co. was the source of LiF.
Beryllium fluoride was prepared by vacuum distillation® from a large
special purchase supplied by the Brush Beryllium Co. The water—clear,
glass-like product contained no spectrographically detectable cation im=-
purities, but was exceedingly hydroscopic and had to be stored under very
anhydrous conditions. Uranium tetrafluoride was taken from a laboratory
purified spectroscopic standard which contained less than 10 ppm of total
cation impurities. Thorium tetrafluoride was part of a special purchase
from the National Lead Co. which contained no greater than 100 ppm in any

cation impurities.

Storms and coworkers of the Las Alamos Scientific Laboratory supplied
each of the uranium carbides used in this study and supplied the following
analysis:

Uranium dicarbide - UC," wt Z C = 8.83 or 75.74 mole % C
02 = 200 ppm

 

*See Results and Discussion Section for an explanation of why the back-

reaction was measured.

**Although uranium dicarbide is a substoichiometric compound, 13 it will be
identified as UC, in this paper.

These high purity carbides were received as lusterous gray-black granules
which ranged in size from 1/2 to 1 m3. They were shipped sealed in glass
ampules and stored in a helium filled dry box. Exposure to even the dry
box conditions was kept to the absolute minimum needed for weighings and

cell loadings.

Procedure - Even though the reagent salts were quite free of cation
impurities, they were not free of oxides and Hy0 to the degree needed. All
compositions were therefore treated while molten at 600°C for oxide removal
by sparging for several hours with reagent HF gas or HF-H, gas mixtures.’
Residual HF was then stripped from the melt with He prior to cooling. Clean
portions of the recovered salt "button' were then crushed and used to
charge the spectrophotometer cell, by weighing out the fluorides in a hel-
ium drybox which was maintained at a water vapor content < 0.1 ppm and at
an 09 content < 2 ppm. Between 0.5 and 0.6 gm of salt solvent made a con-
venient cell loading to which was added from 5 to as much as 100 mg of the
uranium carbide under study. Poco AXF-5Q1l grade graphitel? spectrophoto-
metric cells were used which were purified after fabrication by heating in
an Hy gas stream to 1000°C and then flushed free of Hy; with He. Subsequent
dry box handling and loading techniques have been discussed earlier.1l a
"dash pot" stirrer made from platinum-10% rhodium (see Fig. 2-1) was used
to hasten the attainment of equilibrium which is otherwise dependent large-
ly on diffusion. It proved to be a great aid in shortening the time needed
to reach equilibrium. We observed a small but temporary loss of transmis—
sion directly after stirring in some cases which was equal to 0.15 absorb-
ance units at 4000 cm™t. We have assumed this recoverable loss to be
caused by the temporary suspension of fine particles which later settle.
Whole grains of the carbide were used after early attempts to increase the
surface area by crushing caused the carbide to collect at the window and

interfere with the optical transparency of the cell. A large excess of the

solid carbide phase was always maintained in the cell. On some occasions,
the experimental sequence was interrupted and additional uranium carbide
was added to demonstrate that an excess was indeed present. No change was
observed in the concentrations of UF3 or UF, in the homogeneous solutions

as a result of these additions.

Spectral Measurements - Molar concentrations of dissolved UF3 and UF,

 

were determined simultaneously in solution at a series of temperatures a-
bove the melting point by measuring optical densities at 9174 and 11360 cm-l.
These wave numbers represent the maximum absorbance values for dissolved

UF, and UF, respectively in the near infra-red region as shown in Figs. 2-2
and 2-3. The strong UFj3 absorption in the visible region from 16000 to
33000 em” 1 was in general too intense to be useful since the solutions
studied had initial UF, molarities in the range of 0.04 to 0.10. Figures
2-2 and 2-3 show that for spectra of pure UF, and UF; there is a contribu-
tion from each at the most sensitive absorbance region of the other member.
Stated differently, the absorbance at 9174 em™L in a mixed solution is
primarily due to UF4, but not entirely so. This condition is solved unique-
ly for the contriburion from each species by the solution of a set of simul-
taneous linear equations equal to number to the number of components in the

system which contribute to the net spectra, in our case 2.

Because spectra were recorded versus a neutral screen in the reference
beam (see Fig. 2-1) it was always necessary to subtract a solvent spectrum,
or blank, which was independently determined for each experimental spectrum,

to get the net absorbance due to species in solution.

Analyzing composite spectra required making calibrations for € with
solvent melts containing a known concentration of pure UF, and UF 5. Values
of € are reduced with increasing temperature because of two effects: the
change of molarity caused by thermal expansion and temperature effects on

the absorption spectra themselves.

Changes in molarity due to temperature changes were adjusted by using
S. Cantor's datal? for the molal volume of various fused fluoride salts and
assuming that the molal volumes are additive to within + 3% according to

the following general relations:

and (e2) are recorded in Table

A corresponding calibration was performed for pure UF4 under identical
conditions. This was most easily achieved by adding an excess of a reduc-
ing agent. Both zirconium and uranium metal were used for this purpose,

they react as shown in Eqs. (2-8) and (2-9).

Zr + 4UF, Zz AUF + ZrF (2-8)

U + 3UF, 2 4UF (2-9)

4 3
The effect on the properties of the solutions caused by the production of
ZrF, in Eq. 2-8 was very small and hence neglected for these dilute solu-
tions. When uranium was used concentrations had to be increased by 1/3
over those calculated for UF, in the initial solutions as shown in Eq. (2-9).
Pure UF3 solutions in contact with graphite result in the loss of uranium
from solution by the formation of uc, as shown in Eq. (1-1). Fortunately
this reaction is rather slow under the conditions that we have studied, and
it was possible to correct for this loss by measuring absorbances as a
function of time to determine the rate of loss (da, /dT), and correcting for
the loss by extrapolating back to zero time. Reducing UF, with uranium
does not result in a loss of UF 4 from solution. The addition of Eq. (1-1)
and (2-9) results in the cyclic conversion of U and C to uc, with no net

change of UF, concentration in solution as shown in Eq. (2-10).

An alternate approach to determining the molar absorption coefficients
(e,) for UF 4 in solution has also been used. Since UF, solutions are more
stable than UF, solutions under our experimental conditions, the calibra-
tion results for UF, are more reliable and associated with less error than
are those for UF,. Using this fact the uncertainty associated with the UF

3 3
calibration can be reduced by measuring the absorption spectrum of a mixture

of UF3 and UF, where the UF3 is generated by partially reducing a dilute
UF, solution of known concentration. (The reductant chosen for partial
reduction was UCp.) The spectrum is then converted to digital form along
with a UF, reference spectrum. Using iterative computer techniques, varying
amounts of the UF, spectrum (i.e., k x (UF, spectrum) where k is the coef-
ficient which is varied in the iteration process) are subtracted until the
resulting spectrum visually matches that of previously measured (uncalibra-
ted) UF 4 spectra. When a match is found for a particular value of k, the
concentration of UF, in solution and thus the absorption coefficient can be
calculated knowing the total amount of UF, before reduction. Comparison of
€ values by this method with the total reduction method showed agreement

within a 5% uncertainty.

In Table 2-1, absorption coefficients are listed for the various solu-
tions and temperature ranges that have been studied. Values were taken
from smoothed functions which within the limits of our precision are a

linear function of temperature.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
An equilibrium expression such as the one written in Eq. 1-1 implies
that certain criteria are valid: (1) The equilibrium expression should in-
clude all reactants and products which are involved in the reaction and
these components should combine in the stoichiometry indicated by the ex-

pression. (2) The entire process must be reversible.

Before quantitative data for the equilibrium in Eq. 1-1 were measured,
the above criteria were examined in the following manner: The equation
represents a heterogeneous equilibrium between a molten-fluoride solution
of UF, and UF, and two solid phases, uc, and graphite. The identification
of the UF, and UF, was made by the characteristic absorption spectrum of
each component in the near-infrared and visible regions (4000-33000 en 1).
The identification of these two solute components is well established be-
cause their absorption spectra have been thoroughly documented. 1 In view
of the extensive spectroscopic work which has preceded, there is no spec-

tral evidence for any cations in the solution other than ts, ut,
14

The solid phase components, UC, and graphite, exhibit no measurable

solubility in molten fluorides. hese phases were identified by their
respective X-ray diffraction patterns. A serious anomally arises as a
result of the uc, phase identification since its formation is contrary to
the established phase diagram’> for the U-C system which shows uc, to be

metastable with respect to U,C and graphite at temperatures less than

3
1500°C. On the basis of the uranium-carbon phase diagram and the accepted
free energies of formation for the uranium carbides at temperatures less
than 1000°K, U,C, should be the carbide phase which was identified. Never-

273
theless, UC, has been repeatedly shown to form at these temperatures and

has been established as the stable carbide phase in the equilibrium of Eq.
1-1. The reader who is interested in the details of this identification
is referred to an earlier paper.’ In the present paper we have included a
series of equilibration experiments where excess U,Cq was used to reduce
UF, solutions via the back reaction of Eq. 1-1. Results are compared with

similar experiments where uc, was used as a reductant.

One of the simplest and yet most convincing observations to offer for
the equilibrium is that the stoichiometry of the soluble uranium fluoride
species follows the four-to-three relationship of Eq. 1-1. When a solution

of approximately 0.1 mole 7% UF, in LiF-BeF, is allowed to react with graph-

3 2
ite it is observed that 4 moles of UF, form 3 moles of UF,. For example,
when a 0.068 molar solution of UF, was allowed to react via Eq. 1-1 to form

UF,» it was observed that under conditions where reaction was more than 99%
complete, a 0.049 molar UF, solution resulted. If the process were merely

one of UF oxidation, then 4UF 5 should form 4UF,. For example:

4UF 5 (d) + 2MF Z 4UF 2M (3-1)

2(d) sa) t

where M is a metal such as Ni.

Finally the reversibility of the reaction was demonstrated by the re-
versible temperature dependence of the equilibrium. From a particular tem—
perature at which the system had attained equilibrium and concentrations of

UF, and UF, measured, the temperature could be repeatedly raised or lowered

3 4

causing the relative concentrations of UF, and UF, to shift and attain equi-

3
librium concentrations at these new temperatures. When the system was
15

returned to the initial temperature, the original concentrations of UF3 and
UF, were reproduced. Quantitative aspects of the temperature dependence

will be given in the following sections.

The criteria tests established the equilibrium process as written in

Eq. 1-1. We found it more practical to measure the back reaction mechanism:

3UF, + UC, 7 4UF., + 2C (3-2)

4 3
since, by intentionally adding excess uc,, we could insure that the molten
fluoride solution was always in contact with all the reactive solid phases.

Furthermore, we could interrupt the equilibration and add fresh UC, to

2
demonstrate that the original carbide had not been consumed or altered dur-
ing the course of the reaction. This procedure also insured that more ac—

tive reducing agents, including other uranium carbides, were not present.
An equilibrium quotient for Eq. 3-2 can be written:

4
. (UF ,)

Q = (3-3)

wr)’
where UF 4 and UF, are expressed in mole fractions of the solution. Q is
simply the reciprocal of the equilibrium quotient, Q', for the forward
reaction of Eq. 1-1. The data in the following paragraphs will be presen-
ted as Q values in terms of the back reaction and should not be confused

with forward action.

The effect of variables such as temperature, melt composition, carbide
composition and atmospheric contamination on the equilibrium of Eq. 3-2 in
the solvent system LiF-BeF, have been measured and are treated separately
in the following sections. Since the equilibrium of Eq. 3-2 (also Eq.1-1)
is the central theme of this paper, it will often be cited as simply “the

equilibrium.”
Effect of Temperature on the Equilibrium

Previous results” from the hydrogen reduction of UF, in molten fluor-
ide solutions indicated that the temperature effect on the equilibrium of
Eq. 1-1 should be small. However, when we measured the equilibrium by
either the forward or the back reaction, we found it to be very sensitive

to temperature. This can be seen qualitatively by examining the molten

fluoride absorption spectra of Fig. 3-1 for equilibrium mixtures of dilute

UF and UF, in LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole 7%), in L,

temperatures. The spectra are due only to the UF, and UF, components of

B, over excess uc, at various

the solution. Therefore, by comparing these spectra with the spectra of
pure UF, and pure UF, (Figs. 2-2 and 2-3 respectively), it can be seen that
at 500°C, most of the uranium in solution is present as UF, whereas at
700°C, enough UF,
of Fig. 2-3. The composite spectrum at 600°C resembles neither of the two

is present to make the composite spectrum resemble that

pure component spectra but instead an intermediate mixture of the two.

The quantitative aspects of these spectra were calculated by the pro-
cedure described in the experimental section. From absorption spectra such

as those in Fig. 3-1 concentrations of UF, and UF, were determined in mole

3
fractions and used in Eq. 3-3 to calculate equilibrium quotients, Q, at

various temperatures. The data are presented in Table 3-1 along with Q
values which are then presented in Fig. 3-2 as log, 4Q versus 1/1, (where Te
is the Kelvin temperature). At the top of the figure is shown the centi-

grade scale and at the right side of the figure, the equilibrium ratio,

R = —m—————

where [UF,] and (uF, ] are the concentrations in solution. (Note that the
denominator of Eq. 3-4 represents the total uranium fluoride in solution.)

These R values have been the customary manner in which UF -UF, concentra-

3
tions are expressed within the MSRE program. The two lines drawn through

the data points represent the experimental uncertainty of the data which
arises mainly from the baseline error in the absorption spectra. Equilib-
ria at various temperatures were approached from both the high (open
circles) and low (closed circles) temperature direction. The system was

initially held at ca. 50°C above the temperature desired until the UF, con-

3

centration had ceased to grow (UF, reacting with uc, via Eq. 3-2). Then

the temperature was dropped 50° and the UF 4 concentration was allowed to

fall by reaction of UF, with graphite until no further change could be

3
detected. The equilibrium could be shifted repeatedly in this manner by

varying the temperature of the system. The train of points at any given

temperature represents the approach to equilibrium with only the lowermost
(for open circles) and uppermost (for closed circles) being the best measur-

ed equilibrium value.

The large temperature effect on the equilibrium is exemplified by Fig.
3.2 where the quotient, Q, shifts by 10° in going from 500 to 700°C. In
practical terms, this means that the concentration of UF relative to the
total uranium fluoride in solution is increased from ca. 5% at 500°C to ca.
60% at 700°C. The same large temperature effect on the equilibrium is
found when U,Cq (in place of uc,) is equilibrated with UF, solutions. These
data are presented in Table 3-1 and the resulting Q values are plotted in
Fig. 3-3. Here the Q values are greater at a given temperature than in Fig.
3-2 and therefore support the identification of uc, as the stable carbide
phase of Eq. 1-1. Furthermore the U,Cq equilibration experiments demon-
strate that the UF, stability in dilute fluoride solutions as well as the
temperature effect on the equilibrium would not be far different from that
presented in Fig. 3-2, even if the identification of uc, as the stable
carbide phase of Eq. 1-1 were not correct.

The data of Fig. 3-2 can be used to calculate the change in enthalpy
for the equilibrium. By defining the standard state of the solutes UF, and

3

UF, as one mole percent in L_B, their activity coefficients are unity and

4 2
then the equilibrium quotients become equilibrium constants, K. The change
in enthalpy, AH, for the reaction in the temperature range of 500-650°C can
be calculated from the slope of the line in Fig. 3-2 using the expression:

d (1nK)

AH = -R a(L/T)

(3-5)

where R is the gas constant. The value obtained for AH of Eq. 3-2 is 99.3
Kcal/mole which is surprisingly large in view of the enthalpy change calcu-
lated from enthalpies of formation for the pure, undiluted components at

either 298° or 800°K. These values are given in Table 3-2 and yield pC

-10 Kcal/mole for the undissolved components of Eq. 3-2 at 298°K and ARC

~12.90 Kcal/mole at 800°K. The process of solvation is not included in the

calculation since no heats of solution for UF. and UF, are available. It

3
should be noted that even the sign of the AH is different: We measure an

endothermic process whereas a slightly exothermic process is expected.

Heats of solution could plausibly account for a large amount of the dis-
crepancy since it is observed that the heat of solution for CeF , in L,B
(600-800°C) is 17 Kcal/mole whereas only 10 to 12 Kcal/mole is predicted.
From the enthalpy data, without the heats of solution, we can only conclude
that the thermodynamic data is not adequate to predict the change in en-

thalpy for the reaction.

Effect of Solvent on the Equilibrium

 

In the same way that temperature shifted the equilibrium, changes in
the solvent composition did also. The original purpose of this research
was to demonstrate that changes in the fluoride ion concentration (which
have already been shown to affect the coordination behavior of dilute ur,
solutions o) might be related to shifts in redox equilibria as well. The
effect of changing the solvent composition on the equilibrium is exempli-
fied by comparing the equilibrium quotients, Q, for LiF-BeF, (48-52 mole %),

LB, in Fig. 3~4 with those previously shown in Fig. 3-2 for the L,B compo-

2
sition. At any given temperature (e.g., 500°C), Q is considerably larger

in the LB composition than in the corresponding L,B melt. Therefore the
equilibrium of Eq. 3-2 is shifted to the right by increasing the concentra-

tion of BeF, in the solvent, i.e., by making the solvent more F deficient

2
through the addition of a component which coordinates strongly with fluo-

ride ions. The ratio, R, of Eq. 3-4 at 500°C has been increased from ca.

0.05 for the L,B solvent to ca. 0.55 for the LB solvent (c.f. Figs. 3-2 and

3-4 at 500°C).

The magnitude of this change can be compared with that which is pre-

3+ and wt cations. 1? Real-

dicted from Baes' activity coefficients for M
izing that the only difference in equilibrium quotients between the two
melts is the ratio of the respective activity coefficients, vy, for UF 4 and
UF, raised to the appropriate powers:

QL, 18’ QL,3 x 5 x 107 agrees reasonably

with the estimate from Baes' data. Even better agreement could be obtained
if a non-linear extrapolation (which is suggested by the trend in the data
of Fig. 3-4) is made. Furthermore, it should be noted that Baes' activity

coefficients are only approximate for UF, since they are actually based on

3
data for CeF.,. The comparison serves to show that the magnitude of the

solvent etfect is in reasonable agreement with previous data and consequen-
tly must be considered when estimating UF, stabilities in other molten
fluoride solvent systems.

This leads then to the practical question, "What UF, stability is ex-
pected in the MSRE and the MSBR solvents?". In these ternary systems the
relative measure of F concentration is more difficult to determine than in
the binary system LiF-BeF; since there are two "acidic"* cations in each
competing for fluoride ions. It is currently regarded that the MSRE sol-
vent is more F deficient than LB and results of a previous electrochemi-

cal study of UF3 stability by Manning" support this contention. Little

 

*By "acidic" we mean, in the Lewis acid concept, the tendency to coordinate
with F .
26

attention has been given to the UF, stability in MSBR solvents. We have

first attempted to predict it and finally we have measured it directly.

Realizing the solvent effects on UF, stability arise from changes in

3

the available free F , an attempt was made to estimate the F concentration
. , 18
in MSRE and MSBR solvents based on the earlier observation” that the co-

ordination equilibrium of ut ions in LiF-BeF, solvents depended upon F

2
according to:

UF + F 3-8

We have previously suggested?! that the F~ could be measured by determining

the concentration of uF" and ur, and then estimating the F  concentra-

tion by Eq. 3-8. This method was found to work for LiF-BeF, solutions with

Bef, concentrations of up to 52 mole % and for the MSRE solvent which is

essentially a LiF-BeF, solvent.

The method then was used to estimate the F concentration in the MSBR

solvent. Because the spectrum of UF, in this solvent was largely UF , a
F concentration greater than that in L,B was suggested from Eq. 3-8. We
concluded that the stability of UF, would be very much less than in L,B,

] , 21
and in fact, some earlier UF, stability measurements” tended to support

3

this conclusion.

In contrast to this viewpoint, were activity coefficient data by

C. F. Baes'® and BF, solubility data by S. Cantor’? which suggested that

the UF, should be slightly more stable in the MSBR solvent than in L,B.

We examined this discrepancy by experimentally measuring the stability
of UF, in the MSBR solution over excess uc, in the graphite spectrophoto-
metric cell. The results are shown as log,oQ vs /T, in Fig. 3-5 in the
same form as that used for previous figures. These data show that UF, is

more stable in MSBR than in L,B. From the standpoint of reactor operations,

2
concentration ratios, R, of UF 4 (c.f. Eq. 3-4) of up to 0.03 can be main-

tained safely down to the ca. 500°C freezing point of the solution.

The discrepancy in our earlier’! predictions can only be rationalized
by allowing a more complex coordination mechanism for the MSBR solvent than
+
is described in Eq. 3-8. This probably involves ut which are fluoride

bridged to neighboring ®t or pet so that, through bridging, the

Effect of Atmospheric Contamination on the Equilibrium

In earlier attempts to measure the equilibrium quotients for Eq. 1-1,
it was apparent that the equilibrium concentration of UF 4 in LiF-BeF,
solvents was unusually Low’? compared with the present results. These
results are presented in Table 3-3 and were measured by following the re-
action of UF, in graphite with no uranium carbides added directly to the
system. These reactions were always accompanied by the formation of uo,
and other unidentified solid phases. However after various improvements
were made which eliminated obvious signs of atmospheric contamination, such
as UO, formation, the stability of UF

2 3
sequently concluded that these earlier measurements involved equilibria of

was greatly enhanced. We have sub-

UF, and UF, solutions in graphite and an oxy-carbide phase (as opposed to
a pure carbide phase). It was never possible to identify the oxy-carbide
phase by X-ray analysis despite the fact that the equilibria were very easy

to reproduce from Eq. 3-2.

The effect of atmospheric contamination is clear -- it greatly reduces

the stability of UF, and is therefore a major factor which cannot be ignor-

3
ed when considering UF, stability in molten fluoride solutions.

Effect of Temperature, Solvent and Contamination Compared

 

All of the effects of the variables have been collected to compare
their relative importance and are shown in Fig. 3-6 as log,4Q vs Tt in

the same fashion as the previous figures but with a substantial reduction
in scale. The effect of increasing temperature is similar in all cases,

causing an increase in the stability of UF There is no reason for the

3°
lines to be parallel to each other because they differ principally (except
for the case of the atmospheric contamination) in the activity coefficients

for UF, and UF,

portionately for all solutions. Neither should it be necessary that the

justify greater detail.

Decreasing the F concentration by the addition of BeF, is very bene-

ficial in increasing UF, stability whereas atmospheric contamination causes

3

the opposite and most disasterous effects on UF, stability.

3

Since the MSRE results do not come from our work, the MSRE line is

broken. The stability of UF, in the MSBR solvent is between that of the

MSRE solvent and L,B. It is obvious that the region of greatest UF, sta-
bility is that of high temperature and low F concentration. We therefore

suggest that little UF, could be maintained in F rich solvents such as

3
LiF-NaF-KF (46.5-11,5-42.0 mole %) even if the reported kt reduction by

(25) (4)
UFy 3

were not to occur. Conversely, the greater stability of pure UF
(i.e., not dissolved in a molten fluoride solvent) is explained by the

absence of solvating F .

Other Considerations

 

If the thermodynamic data are sufficiently accurate then it should be
possible to calculate the free energy change for Eq. 3-2 in the solvent

LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole 7%) and then the equilibrium constant by:
AG = -RT 1n K (3-9)

The expressions for the free energy of formation are given in Table 3-4

for UC UF

9 4 and UF, (where the latter two are for the standard state of

 

Table 3-4

one mole percent each in L,B). These free energy functions, when combined
in the proper stoichiometric proportions yield a change of free energy for
Eq. 3-2 of AG = 1.42-4.31 (T,/1000) with a significantly large combined
standard deviation of + 16 Kcal/mole. At 500°C, AG is -1.91 Kcal/mole and
the equilibrium constant from Eq. 3-9 is 3.5. Since these are standard
states for the UF and UF, solutes, then Q is also equal to 3.5 and the
ratio, R, of Eq. 3-4 is 0.89. (c.f. with Q = 1.5 x 1072 and R = 0.03 in
Fig. 3-2). Therefore, from the existing free energies of formation for the
components of the reaction, practically all of a dilute UF, solution in

contact with graphite should be stable. However, neither our results, nor

those from any other investigators support this high a stability of UF 5.

A word of caution should be given at this point. It may seem obvious
to demonstrate UF, stability via Eq. 1-1 by holding J solutions in graph-

ite and allowing the UF, to react with graphite. Furthermore, it may be

3
most convenient to generate a UF, solution by reducing a dilute UF, solution
with a strong reductant such as Be, Zr, or U metal within the same graphite
vessel that will be used for the stability measurement. We have observed
that this results in the formation of mixtures of UC, UyCsq and uc, phases
accompanied by the consumption of more reducing metal than is expected for
the complete UF, reduction. The apparent anomally is caused by the revers-
ibility of Eq. 1-1 since as soon as UF, is formed in excess of its equilib-
rium concentration within the graphite vessel, it reacts with graphite form-
ing uranium carbide phases and UF, in solution. The UF, is, in turn,

reduced again by the excess reductant, forming more UF 5. An example of the

process using Zr metal is:
>
4UF + Zr 4UF 4 + ZrF, (3-10)

4UF + xC IZ 3UF, + UC, (3-11)

4
so that the net reaction is:

=.
UF, + Zr + xC Z ZrF,

This is one of the major reasons why we found it more practical to study

+ uc (3-12)

the equilibrium by the back-reaction mechanism of Eq. 3-2. Although the

UC and U,Cy phases do finally react leaving ultimately uc,, we found that
32

even for our small reaction system of less than 0.5 cc, it took an im-
practical length of time. Larger systems with smaller surface-to-volume

ratios would take even longer.

The question of reaction times brings up the final point to be mention~
ed, that is, the kinetics involved in achieving the equilibrium of Eq. 1-1.

Since UF, is reacting with graphite to form uranium carbides, the mechanism

is obviously heterogeneous. It is considered by these authors far too dif-
ficult a mechanism to attempt to clearly describe; but if reaction rates
are sought, the initial measurements should demonstrate that the mechanism
is heterogeneous by varying the surface~to-volume ratios of the reacting
system. We predict that the outcome of such a measurement will substan-
tiate the heterogeneous mechanism. Another point of caution should be made.
Since larger surface-to-volume ratios mean slower reaction rates, apparent

high stabilities of UF, may appear whereas they actually involve metastable

3
states of the equilibrium mechanism which include uranium carbide phases

other than uc, . These other carbides will ultimately be converted to uc,
by the mechanism of Eq. 1-1; but, until the conversion is completed, the

UF 4 ratio, R, will remain fixed at a high value.

The ultimate aim of the UF 4 stability study has been to describe con-

ditions under which certain UF 4 ratios can be maintained in graphite. To

demonstrate the validity of our measurements we mixed dilute UFq and UF, in

the LB solvent so that the resulting solution had a UF, ratio, R = 0.17.

3
The solution was maintained for a period of a week in the graphite spectro-

photometric cell at 475°C with no loss of UF, or UF, from solution. (c.f.

3
Fig. 3-4 which shows the maximum R at 475°C to be 0.40-0.45).
