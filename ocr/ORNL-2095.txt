FOREWORD

The Aircraft Reactor Test (ART) program was launched early in 1954, The reasoning
and experiments that led first tothe choice of the circulating-fluoridefuel reactor concept
and then to the reflector-moderated reactor configuration have been presented in previous
documents. These include a presentation by R. C, Briant to the USAF Advisory Come
mittee, outlining the objective and status of the ORNL-ANP Program (ORNL report
CF-53-2-126), summaries of the preliminary design work on the Aircraft Reactor Experi-
ment (ARE) (ORNL-1234) and the operation of the ARE (ORNL-1845), and a compre-
hensive summary of ORNL-ANP aircraft power plant designs up te May 1954 (ORNL-1721.
The preliminary layout of the ART and facility was given in the ART hazards report
(ORNL-1875) and in the ANP Project Quarterly Progress Report for the Period Ending
December 10, 1954 (ORNL-1816).

The information compiled in this design report is intended to present a fairly detailed
picture of the ART design as of its approaching completion. It is expected that the
design as defined in this report will be changed somewhat as information is derived

from component test experience, further analytical work, or fabricational problems.

DESIGN CRITERIA
 

 
 

DESIGN CRITERIA

MILITARY REQUIREMENTS

Studies made by Air Force contractors have indi-
cated that aircraft for missions involving strategic
bombing should be capable of operation at sea level
and a speed of approximately Mach 0.9, or at
55,000 ft (or higher) ot Mach 2.0 (or higher), or
above 85,000 ft at about Mach 0.9. An airplane of
unlimited range that could fly any one or, even
better, twe or more of the possibile sfrategic
missions would be extremely valuable if it became
available in the 1965 to 1970 era. in addition to
the strategic bomber application there are require-
ments for lower speed (Mach 0.4 to 0.9), manned,
nuclear-powered airplanes, such as rodor picket
ships and patrol bombers. The problems associated
with supplying a beachhead o substantial distance
from the nearest advanced base indicate that a
logistics-carrier airplane of unlimited range would
also be of considerable value, The strategic-
bombing missions for manned aircraft with shielded
reactors have been deemed te be of such crucial
importance as to more than justify the development
cost of the nuclear power plant.

A nuclear power plant of sufficiently high per-
formance to provide the power required for the most
stringent operating conditions would be able to
take care of any of the other manned-airplane
requirements. Design studies have indicated that
nuclear power plants capable of producing from
100 to 300 Mw will be required. The 60-Mw Aircraft
Reactor Test (ART) is a logical and expeditious
intermediate step in the production of the required
high-power reactors and should give a reactor that
will be capable of providing sufficient power to
operate a radar picket ship, patrol bomber, or
logistics carrier. A reactor power of 60 Mw was
selected because it is approximately the power
that must be reached for an investigation to be
made of the engineering problems that must be
sclved and for disclosure of the operating charac-
feristics to be expected of the higher powered
reactors required for high-altitude supersonic
strategic bombers. The size and weight of the
reactor and shield will conform with aircraft re-
quirements, and, insofar as was possible in the
timited time available, the design of the important
components has been based on concepts satis-
factory for airborne application,

REACTOR DESIGN CRITERIA

The general requirements followed by the ORNL-
ANP project personnel have been consistent with
those for aircraft reactors set forth by the Technical
Advisory Board,! The Board stated that the re-
actor must have a power output of several hundred
megawatts, that it must heat air to temperatures
in excess of 1100°F, and that the reactcr core
must occupy a space not exceeding a few feet in
linear dimensions. The choice of materials must
be limited, of course, to those with desirable
nuclear properties. It was taken into consideration
that the reactor structure must be able to with
stand considerable accelerations or shocks without
large misalignments or changes in reactivity re-
sulting. A reactor with o mechanically simple,
rugged core would thus present a considerable
advantage. The only compensating factor in the
stringent requirements was considered to be the
short lifetime over which the reactor must operate —
500 to 1000 hr.

The uranium investment per reactor was expected
to be a limiting factor in the size of the air fleet,
and therefore the uranium content was fo be as
low as possible. Shortening the reprocessing times
was expected to be of major value in lessening
the uranium inventory required to maintain an air
fleet, Overriding the xenon effect after a prolonged
shutdown or a radical reduction in power level was
expected to be difficult for reactors with high
specific power, However, for some reactors, such
as the homogeneous reactor, the xenon would be
removed shortly after formation and thus would
present no problem.

One major problem was considered to be the con-
struction of confrol mechanisms (and, to ao esser
degree, sensing instruments) for reliable operation
that would respond rapidly and not require undue
extension of the shielded volume. It was believed
that a liquid-fuel reactor with a strong negative
temperature coefficient of reactivity would be
self-stabilizing and would thus require a minimum
of control.

With regard to the vulnerability and safety of the
nuclear-powered airplane it was recommended that
the reactor be isolated from engine failure by an

 

Report of the Technical Advisory Board to the
Technical Committee of the Aircrafi Nuclear Propulsion
Program, ANP-52 (Aug. 4, 1950).
intermediate fluid system. For a high-temperature,
high-power-density reactor in an airplane, loss of
the coolant or loss of circulation of the coolant
would cause rapid overheating. Thus a system in
which the heat of the primary coolant was trans-
mitted to the engines through an intermediate heat
exchanger would be advantageous. Also, by
locating the intermediocte heat exchanger in a pro-
tected position, probably in the shield, it would be
possible to have short, protected flow lines for
the primary fluid. The secondary lines to the
engines could then be independent of each other.
Special provisions would have to be made to take
care of afterheat from fission products after shut.
down.

THE CIRCULATING-FUEL REFLECTOR.
MODERATED REACTOR

The circulating-fuel reflector-moderated reactor
was designed to meet the criteria described. The
use of circulating fused fluoride salts for the fuel
carrier and heat transfer medium has the important
advantage of eliminating the heat transfer stage
required in solid-fuel-element reactors within the
reactor core and with it a complex, delicate matrix
of heat transfer surfaces. With the fuel as the
primary heat iransfer medium, it has been possible
to wrap the intermediate heat exchanger around the
spherical reflector-moderator and thus to keep the
heat exchanger within a relatively small shielded
volume. The activation of the secondary coolant,
NaoK, poses problems in ground handling and mainte-
nance that are offset by the size and weight ad-
vantages of the circulating-fuel design.

The primary control mechanism of this type of
reactor is the strong, negative temperature ceeffi-
cient. Since it will be possible, by scrubbing the
fuel with helium in the pump expansion tank, to
remove the xenon thot is produced, it will not be
necessary to make provision for overriding the
xenon after a shutdown,

Although the circulating-fuel reactor has a some-
what larger uranium investment in the operating
reactor than some proposed aircraft reactors have,
if allowances are made for the inventory in spare
fuel elements and in the reprocessing plant, the
total investment per airplane can he lower for the
circulating-fuel reactor than for most other types of
reactors. In addition, it will be much easier to
replace the liquid fuel than to change the solid
fuel elements. Especially shielded or remotely
controlled ground-handling facilities will be re-
quired only for the fuel filling and draining opero-

tions, The reprocessing of the liquid fuel will be
much simpler and faster than the reprocessing and
refabrication of solid fuel elements, and the
shorter reprocessing time will, of course, lower
the uranium investment.

Operation of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment
(ARE)? demonstrated that a high-temperature
circulating-fuel reactor could be built and operated
and that the materials and machinery which had
been developed for operation at elevated tempera-
tures were satisfactory. It showed that the pre-
dicted large negative temperature coefficient of
reactivity and the resultant selferegulatory charac-
teristics of the reactor could be achieved. The
ARE and other successful experiments have thus
indicated the high probability that aircraft nuclear
power plants employing circulating-fuel reactors
can be developed for military application,

A careful analysis of the multitubular core-
moderated reactor configuration typified by the
ARE disclosed a number of serious problems. The
high power densities necessary in a full-scale
aircraft reactor (1 to 5 kw per cubic centimeter of
core) give severe gamma and neutron heating con-
ditions in the moderating material and hence large
therma! stresses. [t was felt that cracking and
spalling of a brittle material such as the beryllium
oxide used as the ARE moderator could be expected
and that designing to ocilow for this would be
exceedingly awkward, The weight and drag penal-
ties associated with the use of a low-temperature
moderator such as water would be excessive, Ex-
tensive corrosion tests with hydroxides at reason-
able temperatures, that is, 1200°F, had shown that
ncne of the hydroxides would be satisfactory, Too
little was known about the hydrides for them to
be used as the basis for a design. A reacter cone
structed of graphite was too large, and hence the
shield was too heavy. The only moderator-region
materials combination that seemed fo be compatible
with the fluoride fuel—Inconel system was sodium-
cooled beryllium.

The various detailed designs that were evolved
in the effort to incorporate these materials in c
multitubular core fell into twe groups. The first
group of designs was based on the use of a heavy
header sheet across the outlet face of the core to
carry the fluid pressure loads associated with both
the sodium and the fuel pressure drops. A light
header sheet was to be used across the inlet face

tor Experiment, ORNL-1845 (Aug. 22, 1955).

 

 
 

 

that would be sufficiently flexible to accommodate
differential thermal expansion between the parallel
fuel tubes and between the core inlet and outlet
passage shrouds. The beryllium would be in the
form of hexagonal blocks, as in the ARE, and would
be spaced relative to the tubes by spiral wire
spacers to ensure the proper sodium-flow-possage
thickness. The principal disadvantages of this
design approach were the severe thermal and pres-
sure stresses in the outlet header sheet {which
would be at a high temperature} and the severe
pressure siresses in the inlet header sheet under
off-design conditions (e.g., one pump out} if the
sheet were made thin enough to accommodate the
requisite amount of differential thermal expansion,
Possibly less serious disadvantages included a
tendency of the fuel tubes to be bent by the beryl-
lium under the lateral accelerations to be expected
in flight,

In an effort to evolve an arrangement with greater
promise, a second series of designs was prepared
that was based on large disks of beryllium being
placed normal to the tube axes. These disks were
designed to carry the loads induced by the fuel
and the sodium pressure drops. To ensure the
proper sodium flow distribution, the spacing be-
tween the fuel tubes and the beryllium was again
accomplished by spiral wire spacers. Moderately
thick header sheets were employed, with provision
for both transverse and axial differential thermal
expansion at the outlet end. This latter feature
presented a major problem, and, to date, no really
sound detail design has been worked out to
accommodate both the differential expansion be-
tween the beryllium and the header sheet and at
the same time take the pressure loads imposed by
off-design conditions.

Multigroup calculations made concurrently with
the above design studies indicated that it was
advantageous to lump the fuel heavily fo minimize
the amount of structural material in the reactor,
Concurrent shielding studies showed that about
12 in. of goed neutron shielding followed by o
layer of boron was required between the core and
the heat exchanger te keep the activation of a
fluid such as NaK from becoming excessive.
Pursuance of these design precepts yielded a
reflector-moderated configuration which gave not
only a lower shield weight than had been obtained
with any configuration previously devised but also

a lower fuel concentration than could be obtained
from a multitcbulor core having the same core
diameter, according te multigroup calculations
made of the time. Even more important, these
calculations indicated that the reflector-moderated
core design gave both the lowest average and the
fowest peak power density in the fuel for a given
core diameter of any core design studied.

The volume heat source in the circulating fuel
presents a set of problems having ne previous
technological parailel. The fuel temperature in
stagnant regions fends fo rise rapidly, and it can
easily reach excessive values if the hydredynamic
design is not satisfactory. Analytical selutions
for a few simple geometries, such as fully de-
veloped flow in a straight tube, have been worked
out, and tests have validated the analytical solu.
tions. More complex geometries, such as those
represented by the reflector-medercted reactor,
can be analyzed with assurance only by means of
experimental techniques. Thus a multitubular
reactor core design offers o major advantage in
that it is more amenable to analysis, although it
would be likely to present header flow passage
design problems at the inlet and outlet.

A careful appraisal of the many different factors
involved led finally to the choice of the reflector.
moderated type of core because it appeared to
give the lightest shield for ¢ given power density
and fuel concentration in the fuel, as well as a
configuration relatively free of stress concentro-
tions in the core structure, Although the actual
fabrication ond ossembly of the concentric cone
figuration of the core of the reflector-moderated
reactor present some exceedingly difficult prob-
lems, it is felt that they are no more difficult than
the problems that would be encountered in a well-
designed multitubular-core reactor. Thus, after
reviewing afl the various considerations, it was
decided in 1954 that the reflector-moderated core
should be adopted as the basis for the ART design.

The objectives of building and operating the ART
are the investigation of the methods of construce
tion ond the estimated performance characteristics
of such a reflectore-moderated circulating-fuel
reactors An operating life of 500 hr at or near
60 Mw is considered tc be a desirable geal, The
information gained from the test will provide a
sound basis for the design of full-scale aircraft
reactors.

THE ART ASSEMBLY

THE REACTOR ASSEMBLY

The reactor ond shield assembly will consist
of the core, the beryllium island, the beryllium
reflector-moderator, the pressure shell, the fuel
system (including the fuel pumps and the xenon-
removal system), the fuel-to-NaK heat exchanger,
the reflecter-moderator cooling system, the control
system, and the aircraft-type shield, The reactor
(Fig. 1) comprises ao series of concentric shells,
each of which is a surface of revolutien aboui the
vertical axis. The two inner shells surround the
fuel region at the center (that is, the core of the
reactor) end separate it from the beryllium islond
and the outer beryllium reflector. The fuel circu-
fetes downward through the bulbous region where
the fissioning takes place and then downward and
outward to the entrance of the spherical-shell fuel-
to-NaK heat exchanger that lies between the re-
flector outer shell and the main pressure shell.
The fuel flows upward between the tubes in the
heat exchanger into two centrifugal sump-type fuel
pumps at the top. From the pumps if is discharged
inward to the top of the annular passage leading to
the reactor core. The fuel pumps are located in
the expansion tank region at the top of the reactor.
A horizontal section through this region is shown
in Fig, 2.

The reflector-moderator
which flows downward through spaces between the
core shells and the beryllium and through passages
in the beryllium and back upward through the
annular spaces between the beryllium and the en-
. closing shells and between the pressure shell and
© the pressure shell liner. Two sump-type centrifugal
pumps af the top of the reactor circulate the sodium
first through the reflector-moderator and the island
and then through the small toroidal sodium-to-NaK
_ heat exchangers around the periphery of the pump—
“expansion tank region. A horizontal section through
this region is shown in Fig. 3.

The Inconel pressure shell constitutes both the
main structure of the reactor and a compact con-
tainer for the fuel circuit. The pressure shell
encloses a liner composed of ancther Inconel shell,
a layer of boron carbide to remove thermal neutrons,
and an inner Inconel can. Heat generated in the
pressure shell by the absorption of gamma rays
from the fuel will be removed by sodium flowing
upward from the bottom of the island between the
outer surface of the liner and the inner surface of

is cooled by sodium

the pressure shell. Passages at the top of the
reactor will direct the sodium frém the outer
surface of the pressure shell to the sodium-to-NeK
heot The pressure shell is
separated by thermal insulation from the gamma-ray
shield, which is a layer of lead. The lead, in turn,
is surrounded by a region of borated water. A
vertical section through the lead-water shield is
shown in Fig. 4.

teristics of the ART are presented in Table 1,
except for the system flow and pump data, which
are given in Table 2. Key data on dimensions are
given in Table 3,

REACTOR DIMENSIONS

The dimensions of the reactor core were estab.
lished by calculations and by critical experiments.
A parametric study was made of a set of 48 related
reacfors in which the parameters of core diamster,
reflector thickness, and fuel thickness were varied
over a wide range. In this study the effects of the
geometry of the reflector-moderated reactor on the
physical quantities of interest, such as eritical
mass, required mole per cent of uranium in the fuel,
and power distribution, were determined. Core radii
of 20, 30, 40, and 60 cm and extrapolated reflector
thicknesses of 20, 30, and 40 cm were selected for
the set of related reactors. Poison (scdium and
Inconel) distributions in the reflector and island
were obtained from a study by Bussard and others, ?
The fluoride fuel NaF-ZrF UF, was used for the
entire set of calculations. From the set of 48
reactors defermined by the specified independent
parameters, it was possible to select 30 reactors
that would give results that could be used to cross-
plot and interpolate the properties of the 18 omitted
reactors fo an accuracy sufficient for this survey.
The results obtained are summarized in Figs, 5, 6,
7, and 8,

Physical property studies indicated the desir-
ability of limiting the uranium content of the fuel
to 5 mole % UF, (see Part Ili, “Design and Devel-
opment Studies’’), and therefore it is clear from

Fig. 5 that considerable advantage is gained by
increasing the reflector thickness from 20 to 30 cm
but little advantage from a further increase to
40 cm. Even more important, the activation of the
NaK in the heat exchanger can be reduced markedly
by increasing the reflector thickness. A 30-cm-
thick reflector gave a good compromise between
shielding, criticality, and NaK activation consider-
ations, The remaining analyses of the data were
therefore restricted to a 30-cm reflector thickness.

The effect on total uranium investment of the
reactor dimensions and the external fuel volume,
such as will exist in the heat exchanger external

16

to the core, is shown in Fig. 6. The surface shown
for zero external volume is, of course, simply that
for critical mass. At a core radius of 30 cm the
critical mass is virtually independent of fuel thick-
ness. In the surfaces for both the 2- and 4-f3
external volumes, simple visua! examination indi-
cates the probable existence of an optimum set of
proportions. The reversal of scales for the 8-ft3
surface was necessitated by the existence of an
extreme peck at what was the front corner.

average power-density ratio is shown in Fig. 7.

and a fluorocarbon plastic, Teflon, to simulate the

beryllium. The fuel region was constructed in the

The assembly was then modified to include three

reflector by the fuel, The first of the three-region
assemblies had no Inconel core shells, the second

REFLECTOR-MODERATOR

The design of the reflector-moderator region pre-
sented several problems, Heat will be generated
in the reflector by the absorption of gamma rays
coming from the fuel ond heat exchanger regions
and by the slowing down of fast fission neutrons,
Gamma rays will also result from parasitic capture
of neutrons in the structural material and the cool-
ant. One particularly strong source of hard gamma
rays will be the Inconel shell that separates the
fuel annulus from the outer reflector. These gamma
rays will be absorbed over an appreciable volume
because the photon energy will be high and the
attenuation small, A lesser amount of
heating will also result from the generation of
gamma rays by neutron capture in the beryllium.
The heat generated by radiation in the various
regions of the reactor and the heat transfer from the
fuel system to the reflector ond island cooling
circuits are given in Table 5.

coclant, sodium, are given in Tables 1-3. Sedium
was chosen as the coolant because of its excellent
heat transfer properties and reasonably low neutron-
capture cross section.

Experimental evidence has established the fea-
sibility of operation of a sodium-beryllium-Inconel
system if the temperature of the system is main-
tained below 1250°F. Cycling tests have also
shown that the thermal stresses that will be set up
in the beryllium should not give serious trouble.

FUEL SYSTEMS
Core Hydrodynamics

The hydrodynamic characteristics of the reactor
core are intimately related to those of the pumps,
because the pumps must be placed in the lowest
temperature portion of the circuit, that is, just
ahead of the core inlet. This is necessary partly
because of the fairly high stresses in the impellers
and partly because of the shaft seal problem, which
is discussed in the following section on *‘Pumps

and Expansion Tank.” All the initial layouts em-
ployed axial-flow pumps coaxial with the island,
but because the structural problems associated
with the long impeller overhang proved to be diffi-
cult, the hydrodynamically less desirable arrange-
ment employing centrifugal pumps was chosen
as the more practicable solution. Further it seemed
likely that two pumps either in series or parallel
would be required if boiling of the fuel as a conse-
quence of afterheat was to be avoided in the event

that one pump failed.

Prefiminary analyses of various centrifugal pump
core inlet configurations indicated that the high-
velocity streams from the pump impeller would be
likely to change completely the flow pattern ob-
tained within the core. High-velocity streams are
disinclined to diffuse once they have become
separated from the walls of the pump volute, and
their momentum con carry them all the woy from the
impeller through the plenum chamber, through the
vanes at the core inlet, and even through the core
itself to such an extent that flow separation and,
sometimes, flow reversal in the core would tend to
occur, The most promising configuration cppears
to be that in which the pump volutes discharge
tangentially into a cylindrical extension of the core
inlet, as in Fig, 2. The high swirl velocity induced
in this region gives a system relatively insensitive
to the stoppage of one pump.

From the shielding stondpoint an ideal circu-
lating-fuel reactor would have very tiny inlet and
outlet
through these ducts and fissioning in regions close
to the outer surface of the reflector. While the
relations between end-duct size and shield weight

ducts to minimize both neutron leckage

are very complex, there is a strong incentive to
minimize the end-duct size. This, coupled with
hydrodynamic considerations associated with the
pump design, particularly the volute-discharge areq,
and reactor physics studies, led to the choice of
the core inlet proportions and hence the basic core
layout of Fig. 12.

The core of the reactor consists of a divergent-
convergent annular passage that is symmetrical
about the equatorial plone; that is, the converging
and diverging sections have the same shape. The
area perpendicular to the flow path at the equator
is approximately four times the area dt the inlet or
discharge ends. The equivalent cone angle of the
divergent and convergent sections is aporoximately

28 deg (included angle).

26

In the design of the core it has been considered
necessary, in order to avoid local regions of ex-
cessive temperature, to effect a uniform circum
ferential distribution of the flow around the inlet
annulus and to assure that the fuel will traverse
the divergent section of the core without incurring
stagnation or reversal of the fluid boundary layers.
Furthermore, it is desired that the required flow
conditions obtain with only one pump in operation
so that the reactor can be run at some appreciable
fraction of rated power with one of the two fuel
sumps inoperable,

It is well known that the flow of fluids in diver-
gent channels is subject fo the growth and the
eventual separation and reversal of boundary layers.
The probability of the occurrence of these phe-
nomena increases as the degree of divergence, os
represented by the inlet-to-cutlet area ratio, and
the rate of divergence, as represented by the equi-
valent cone angle, are increased, Flow in a diver-
gent channel is also adversely affected by uneven
distribution either circumferentially or radially at
the inlet. Common industrial practice calls for
divergence rates to be of the order of 7 to 10 deg
included angle when preceded by several diameters
straight run of pipe. Where care has been taken
to achieve a symmetrical velocity profile with
thin boundary layers at the inlet, nonreversed flow
has been obtained in divergent channels having a
20-deg equivalent cone angle with an area ratio of
2:1. Both the degree and the rate of divergence
of the ART fuel annulus are greater than those
previously encountered, even under special test
conditions. In addition, the necessity for com-
pactness of the reactor rules out the possibility of
achieving distribution and thin boundary
layers at the inlet by the most common method,

even

namely, a convergence of the channel immediately
ahead of the inlet preceded by several diameters
straight run of pipe.

Fortunately, it is not necesscrily essential that
the axial velocity distribution across the fuel
annulus be uniform; the essential requirement is
freedom from hot spots, particularly ot the walls.
The wall hot spot, or boundary layer heating effect,
is very much a function of the intensity of eddy
diffusivity, or turbulence, in the core. Thus, from
the standpoint of boundary layer heating, a non-
uniform velocity distribution might actually be
more desirable if the turbulence level were high
than would a more uniform velocity distribution if
the turbulence level were low.

The practice of interposing screens across a flow
channel to achieve symmetry of the velocity profile
is widely followed. It is also well known that
screens across the discharge of a divergent chan-
ne! tend to stabilize flow and to delay stagnation
or flow reversals. In the ART fuel annulus it was
highly desirable to avoid the use of screens for
either purpose, since they would require increased
pumping power to overcome the added resistance fo
flow and since they would, if used in the fissioning
zone, increase the critical fuel concentration be-
cause of their poisoning effect,

The core flow problem was therefore twofold.
Good flow distribution was to be obtained at the
inlet, in the limited space available, with either
one pump or both pumps operating; and flow through
the core was to be without stagnation or other
effects that would give local hot spots in the fluid.
Also, these conditions were to be achieved with a
minimum of pressure loss and, preferably, without
insertion of Inconel bodies into the fissioning zone
of the core.

The desired flow distribution at the inlet was
obtained with a swirl-type header, which provides
space ot the inlet for circulation of an excess of
fuel; that is, the volume of fuel which circulates
around the inlet is greater than that which enters
the inlet, and thus even circumferential distribution
of the flow results.

The approximate volume of the core was dictated

by fuel concentration considerations, and core
annulus radii were set at the inlet and at the
equator. A simple two-dimensional flow analysis

indicated that pressure gradients resulting from
passage curvature would be small relative to those
resulting from divergence. An arbitrary cosine
curve connecting the mean radii at the inlet and
equator was therefore used as the passage mean
line. The shape of the annulus was then deter-
mined by superimposing on the mean line a sched:
ule of cross-sectional areas such that the resulting
static pressure gradient at any peint would be a
function of the local dynamic pressure,

tc be a criterion for boundary layer separation,
where

a, b, ¢, and d are constants,

i is the shape parameter,

g is the local velocity pressure outside the
boundary layer,

x is the distance along the axis of the channel,

¢ is the boundary layer momentum thickness,

Ty is the wall friction.

if H, 0, and the term 29/7, are assumed to be con-
stant with x, the shape parameter can be written

H=A+B~-—,

where A and B are constants, P is static pressure,
and (1/4) dP/dx con be used as a criterion of
separation. Obviously (1/g) dP/dx is minimized if

it is constant throughout the divergence. However,

if “this were the case, the passage would still be
diverging at the equator, and an undesirable dis-
continuity would result in the shape of the core
shells at this point. The divergence is therefere
modified so that it is higher at the inlet than would
be the case for

todpP

ond it is zero af the equator.

The core shape thus obtained was tested for flow
profiles, with water as the working fluid and with a
simulated swirl-type header, The results showed
that the tangential velocities were high throughout
the core but that a small upward velocity component
prevailed clong the inner wall of the diverging
section. At all other points the axial velocity was
downward. The reason for this flow pattern is
obvious, Rotation of the fluid about the axis of the
core creates a radial pressure gradient. Decay of
the rotational velocity component as a result of
friction as the fluid moves axially creates an axial
pressure gradient that is positive along the inner
wall and negative along the outer. These gradients
are algebraically additive to the positive gradient
resulting from the divergence of the passage. The
net effect favors flow reversal on the inner wall.

it was determined by test that if a solid-body-
rotation pattern (rotational velocity component di-
rectly proportional to radius) were used the natural
tendency for separation to occur on the outer wali,

 

 
 

 

as exhibited by irrotational flow, would be over-
come when the absolute velocity vectors at the
outside diameter of the inlet were between 15 and
20 deg off the axis. Accordingly, a set of inlet
guide vanes was designed for use with the swirl-
“type header which would set up a 20-deg solid-body
rotation. The guide vanes were designed so that
the equivalent cone angle of the intervening pas-
sages would be 10 deg, with the schedule of di-
vergence following the relation dP/dx = aq clong a
2/1 ellipitical mean line. The resulting blades had
blunt trailing edges that blocked approximately 17%
of the inlet passage area. The trailing edge area
was distributed so that the blockage occurred in
the mid-passage region, with no blockage next to
the walls. As was expected, the inlet guide vane
system gave flow reversal along the inner wall,
This reversal was eliminated by o drag ring which
blocked part of the inlet area af the blade trailing
edges. The size and location of the ring were
determined by experiment. This combination of
header, core shape, and inlet guide vane system
gave flow in which the throughput component was
not stagnated or reversed at any point on either
wall. The pressure loss across the inlet guide
vane system was less than that obtained with no
guide vanes. In other words, the inlet guide vanes
recovered part of the inlet velocity head. The re-
lations between the inlet headers, inlet guide
vanes, and core are shown in Fig. 13.

The flow problem is made particularly difficult by
the design having to be evaluated by experimental
tests. Various techniques, including pitet trav-
‘erses, flow visualization through the use of dye
injections, and conductivity probe measurements on
sait injections, are being used. Tests that are felt
to be definitive are being carried out on the most
premising designs, both with and without vanes, in
a one-half-scale model. The volume heat source
of the reactor core is simulated with electrically
heated sulfuric acid.

While the results of the tests made to date are
still being studied, and they certainly pose ques-
tions that have yet to be resclved, it does appear
that the system performs better without the inlet
guide vanes than with them. The principal problem
either with or without the vanes appears to be that
of temperature fluctuations at the wall caused by
eddying of the fuel. An experimental evaluation of
the amplitude that can be tolerated for such fluc-
tuations is under way.

Pumps and Expansion Tank

Various types of pumps were considered for use
in the high-temperature-liquid systems. Those seri-
ously considered included conventional centrifugal
ond axial-flow pumps and electromagnetic and
canned-rotor pumps. Many of these pumps were
tested at ORNL, and some performed quite suc-
cessfully.” Each type was found to have advan-

tages and disadvantages that had to be evaluated

according to the operating requirements of high-
temperature-liquid systems for aircraft installations.

A most important requirement of an aircraft type
of pump is that its weight be reasonable. From the
standpoint of the aircraft designer the weight
should include all the equipment required to drive
the pump; that is, if an electric motor were used,
the weight of the electrical generator should also
be included. The importance of the weight of the
drive equipment makes the efficiency of the pump
also an important consideration. The combination
of these two factors eliminates electromagnetic
pumps from consideration for aircraft applications,
because the weight of an electromagnetic pump is
inherently from 100 to 1000 times greater than that
of a centrifugal pump driven by a hydraulic motor
or an air turbine. [t appears that a centrifugal-pump
drive-system weight of about 1 lb/hp con be ob-
tained with an air bleed-cff turbine type of system.
A further disadvantage of electromagnetic pumps is
thot they are not suitable for operation with molten
salts,

Canned-rotor pumps were also considered, but
they have the some disadvantage thot the eleciro-
magnetic pump has of requiring heavy electrical
generators. A further disadvantage is that the thin
shell required between the rotor and the field
magnets constitutes a frangible diaphragm in the
system, A very large jet of fluid may be ejected
when such ¢ rupture occurs, and a serious fire
would result. Pumps that do not require frangible
diaphragms in the system may give trouble by
producing small leaks which would be annoying and
troublesome, but such difficulties are relatively
trivial when compared with major abrupt ruptures.
Even though the canned-rotor type of pump is suit-
able for operation with molten salts ond even
though failure of a canned-rotor pump diaphragm
should not lead to a sericus fire with molten salts,
the large amounts of radioactivity that would be
expected in the molten salts in a full-scale reactor
would constitute o for more serious hazard than the
fire associated with sodium or NoK. Thus it ap-
pears that neither the electromagnetic nor the
canned-roter type of pump is well suited to nuclear
aircraft application.

Quite ao variety of mechanical pumps was con-
sidered, but the mixed-flow end radial-flow types
of centrifugal pump seem to be much the best
adapted to aircraft requirements. Since it is es-
sential that the reactor core and the heat ex-
changers be as compact as possible, it is neces-

30

sary to make use of rather high pressure drops
through these components. This in turn means that
the pump heads must be between 30 and 300 ft.
Therefore if an axial-flow type of pump were em-
ployed, it would be necessary to use multiple
stages, Flow rates of 500 to 5000 gpm will be
required, and thus relatively high shaft speeds are
essential if the impeller diameter is to be kept to
6 to 12 in. Impellers of this small size are es-
sential if the installetion is to be kept reasonably
compact.

The principal problem in the design and develop-
ment of a centrifugal pump for high-temperature
liquids is the shaft seal, and quite a number of
seals were considered.® One of the first con-
sidered was a graphite-asbestos packing placed
around the pump shaft, with the gland either in the
fluid being pumped or in the gas space above the
fluid in a sump pump. This type of seal tends to
give a considerably higher leakage rate than is
acceptable and a relatively short shaft life, since
the shaft wear is substantial, It works tolerably
well when used above the gas space in the sump
pump; but, if the seal is placed in the pumped fluid
so that there is seepage through it, oxidation of the
fluid takes place at the outboard end of the seal,
and high shaft wear and corrosion rates are likely
to result.

An unusual type of seal that has received a con-
siderable amount of attention is the frozen seal.”
This type of seal was first developed for use with
sedivm, It depends on the use of a cooled gland
around the shaft that is flooded with the fluid being
pumped. Friction between the pump shaft and the
frozen fluid in the gland is sufficient to melt a
very thin film at the shaft surface. A seal of this
type works well with sodium, because the shear
strength of the sodium is only of the order of 50 to
100 psi at room temperature, and also well with
lead, which has a shear strength of several hundred
pounds per square inch ot a temperature of around
200°F. The freezing temperatures of sodium and
lead can be readily obtained with a water-cooled
gland. Efforts to make this type of seal work with
NaK hove been unsuccessful because of the seal
gland having to be cooled to well below the eu-
tetic temperature (about —15°F). Unfortunately,
the hardness values of the flueride fuels are much
higher in the tempercture range immediately below

their melting points thon the hardness value for
sodium. Frozen seal experiments hove been made
with many fluoride mixtures, including many glassy
melts with large percentages of beryllium fluoride,
but in all instances serious cutting of the shaft
occurred within a few hundred hours, In addition,
large amounts of power were required for contin-
vous operation, and very large amounts of torque
were necessary in order to break the frozen seal
during startup of the pump; pumps normally re-
quiring only 3+ to 5-hp motors were found to require
30- to 50-hp motors to be started.

The face type of seal used widely in automobile
water pumps, refrigerant pumps, end domestic water
pumps dppears to be a promising solution fo the
seal problem. [n most applications it is flooded
with the pumped fluid during operation. Its very
low leakage rate and fong fife depend on the mating
faces of the seal being finished to essentially
optically flat surfaces. The liguid tends to fill the
space befween the two seal surfaces ond to form a
meniscus between the edges of the seal faces on
the gas side. The surface tension in the meniscus
across this very narrow gap gives a pressure in the
fluid between the seal faces that is sufficient to
hold the surfaces apart, Therefore the surfaces do
not contact each other, but, rather, they shear the
fluid film between them, Thus the seal surfaces
operate under ideal lubrication conditions. Seals
of this type have operated for years with no meas-
urable wear. They are relatively insensitive to
starts and stops if the seal-face pressure is kept
tow. It is important that they be adequately cooled
and that the product of the pressure in pounds per
square inch on the seal face and the rubbing ve-
locity in feet per minute not be excessive. Values
"as high as 100,000 for this pressure-velocity factor
have been reported, with the parts giving very
satisfactory service life. It is essential that the
mating surfaces in ¢ seal of this type be compatible
from the standpoint of boundary lubrication, or else
they moy be scored during storts and stops. It is
also very important that this type of seal be
mounted on a shaft that runs true, with a minimum
of vibration. This means that the shaft must be
well balanced with the impeller and bearing as-
sembly, that the radial lcoseness in the bearings
must be small, and that the seal must be mounted
in such a way that it is both concentric and square
with the axis of the shaft, Also essential is
flexibility in the secl mounting, which can be
readily obtained either with a corrugated diaphragm

or a bellows, the latter being the more commonly
used. Since graphite is a porous material, the
graphite washers used in seals of this type are
ordinarily impregnated with materials suck as a
plastic, lead, babbit, silver, ete. For high-temper-
ature use in the ART fuel pumps the seal will
operate with inert gas on one side and a flood of
oil on the other, rather than fuel, to prevert con-
tamination of the fuel.

The bearing problem has much in common with
the seal problem for high-temperature-fluid pumps.
In all instances the fluids are very corrosive to
mest materials, and therefore only a few materials,
such as graphite, certain iron-chrominumenicke! al-
loys, and cemented carbides, can be used. Further,
the fluids pumped will remove any adsorbed films
such as sulfides, phosphides, etc., that would
tend to alleviate boundary-layer lubrication con.
ditions, The viscosity of sodium is about one-
fiftieth that of water, while the viscosity of the
fluoride fuel mixture is about the same as that of
water. Thus neither of these fluids serves as a
really good lubricant, While they have the advan-
tage of wetting the surfaces of iron-chromium-nickel
alloys very effectively, they tend to strip off the
protective films that are formed under ordinary con-
ditions in most types of petroleum- or other nydro-
carbon-lubricated bearings. It is evident that
bearings designed to operate in molten metal or
moiten salt must be lightly loaded and carefuily
aligned.

The investigations have indicated that the bear-
ing and seal should be placed in a cool zone above
the pump impeller with a heat dam between them
and the fluid being pumped. This arrangement
makes it possible to use conventional bearings
and seals. Pumps of this type have proved to be
quite satisfactory and have the advantage of being
relatively insensitive to the type of fluid being
pumped; that is, the same type of pump can be used
for sodium, NaK, the fluoride fuel mixture, lead,
sodium hydroxide, or other fluids,

Two fuel pumps and two sodium pumps will be
located at the top of the reactor, These pumps will
be similar, but the fuel pumps will have the iarger
flow capacity. The fuel pumps will also include
xenon-removal systems in which most of the xenon
and krypton and probably some of the other gaseous
fission-product poisons will be removed from the
fluoride fuel mixture by scrubbing with helium. The
fuel will enter the xenon-removal system from the
eye of the pump and will pass up the center of the

31
shaft and inte the mixing chamber. In the mixing
chamber the fuel will spray through a helium at-
mosphere and impinge on the wall of the chamber.
The resulting mixture will be very foamy and will
have a large gas interface. The helium will enter
the system just below the shaft secl and flow down
the annulus around the shaft, through the upper
slinger vanes, and into the mixing chamber. The
fuel-helium mixture will then be pumped into the
fuel expansion volume, where the helium containing
the xenon, krypton, and other fission-product gases
will be removed via the off-gas system. The circuit
will be completed when the {fuel leaves the expan-
sion volume by gravity flow inte the centrifuge,
where any entrained gas will be removed and then
be returned to the expansion volume. The fuel will
be pumped through the centrifuge holes ond will
re-enter the main fuel system on the discharge side
of the fuel pump. The system is illustrated in

Fig. 14.

Experimental results obtained with a single pump
operating in a test loop showed that the fuel level
in the expansion chamber and the rate of bleed flow
affect the ability of the centrifuge to prevent helium
bubbles from entering the main fuel system, The
system operates very well with a fuel level of % in,
in the expansion chamber and a bleed flow of up to
13 gpm. With a fuel level of 3 in. in the expansion
chamber the system con be operated with a bleed
flow of 25 gpm. The design value for the bypass
flow rate is 12 gpm. Similar tests on a full-scale
aluminum model of the fuel pump-—expansion tank
region have given similar results.

A number of other special features have been in-
cluded in the pump design for adaptation to the
full-scale reactor shield. The pump has been de-
signed so that it can be removed or installed as a
subassembly, with the impeller, shaft, seal, and
bearing comprising a single compact unit. This
assembly will fit into a cylindrical casing welded
to the top of the reactor pressure shell. A 3-in.
layer of gamma-ray shielding just above a Y%-in.
layer of zirconium oxide around the lower part of
the impeller shaft will be at the same level as the
reactor gamma-ray shield just outside the pressure
shell, The space between the bearings will be
filled with oil to avoid a gap in the neutron shield.
The pumps will be powered by hydraulic drive units
in order to provide good speed control, along with
compact, reliable motors.

Fill-and-Drain System (Including Enricher)

The system designed for filling the reactor with
the barren fuel-carrier salt NaZrF, for adding the
enriched uranium-bearing fuel component Na, UF,
and for draining the reactor is described schemat-
ically in Fig. 15. For the initial filling operation
the fuel carrier will be added to the fill-and-drain
tank at a temperature of about 1200°F and will be
pressurized into the reactor a number of times at
this temperature. The reactor ond the fill-and-
drain tank will have been preheated by operation
of their respective NaK systems.
60% of the uranium-bearing component of the fuel
will then be added from a simple melt pot by gas
pressure transfer.
material required to achieve criticality will be
added in small increments by using the enricher
device shown in Fig. 15.

The fuel fill-and-drain system is designed to
permit the transfer of fuel tc and from the reactor
after the reactor system has been completely
assembled. A heating system is included to
maintain the fuel at o temperature above its
melting point. This same system also serves to
cool the fuel by removing decay heat from fuel
drained after the reactor has been operated at

Approximately

The remaining uranium-bearing

power.

The initial fuel charge is to be admitted to the
fuel fill-and-drain tank through a fill nozzle
provided at the top of the tank. This initial filling
operation will be carried out by personnel who will
be inside the pressure vessel aot the fill-and-drain
tank. After the addition of the barren salt to the
fill-and-drain tank, the system will deliver this
salt into the reactor for initic! testing. The barren
salt will then be drained for the addition of the
enriching mixture. The system will then be used
to fill or partly fill and drain the reactor a number
of times for mixing the salt and enriching mixture.
This enriching and mixing cycle may have to be
repeated a great many times. Fuel flow into the
reactor will be by displacement with helium, and
flow back to the fill-and-drain tank will be by
gravity. The helium displaced from the reactor
during fuel addition will be discharged through
the off-gas system. Helium displaced from the
drain tank as the fuel is drained will flow through
part of the off-gas piping into the top of the
reactor.

the operation when an emergency requires that
the fuel be drained. Under these conditions, heat
will have to be removed from the fuel at a rate
equal to the fission-product-decay heat-liberation
rate.

Finally, the fuel fill-and-drain system will
receive the fuel from the reactor at the completion
of the test and will held it as long as decay heat
requires cooling of the fuel. It will then be dis-
placed by helium pressure into the fuel recovery
tank for removal. No provision has been made for
transferring the fuel back from the recovery tank
to the fill-and-drain tank or for cocling the fuel
in the recovery tank.

After the preliminary design studies were com-
pleted, it was decided that the fill-and-drain tank
should be designed with twe independent sets of
cooling tubes, each designed to permeate com-
pletely the fuel volume. This arrahgement will
permit the tank to be cooled even though some
component of one of the two cooling systems, such

as a pump, radiator, or pipe, should fail. The

34

design heat load on the tank is 1.75 Mw. The
theoretical decay heat at the instant of shutdown
in a 60-Mw reactor is given as about 3.6 Mw, but
only a 1.75-Mw cooling system is required, becouse
the fuel will not be drained into the drain tank
until the fission heat is negligible and until the
fuel has been cooled to below 1200°F. The drain
valves will not be opened until at least 8 sec
after the control rod has been fully inserted. The
design is based upon the assumption thet such
emergency fuel drainage would occur after contin-
vous operation at 60 Mw for one month, The heat
capacities of the fuel and mechanical equipment
are great enough toc cbsorb the decay heat above
1.75 Mw for the few minutes during which the
decay heat generation would exceed this rate.

The fuel piping between the reactor and the
fill-and-drain tank is designed to drain all the
fuel from the reactor under gravity flow conditions
ft is calculated that this
condition will be met even though one of the two
drain valves cannot be opened.

in not more than 3 min.

The requirement for a completely reliable cooling
system seems to be met by the use of bundles of
ceoling tubes inserted into the tank. In order to
provide cooling for all metal surfaces in contact
with the fuel, the tank and the stendpipe to the
reactor are both jacketed. The coolant to be used
for this service will be NaK (56-44 wt %). To
provide two independent sets of cooling passages,
each of which permeates the entire fuel volume, a
horizontal, cylindrical tank was selected, with
each end serving as a tube sheet. Horizontal
decks of U-tubes arranged on each tube sheet in
a square-hcle pattern provide alternate layers
that originate at opposite ends of the rank (Fig.
16}. Design calculations indicate that following
an emergency drainage of the fuel, the cooling
system will, even with only one circuit functioning,
limit the fuel temperature in the tank to 1800°F.
When both coolant circuits function, the maximum
temperature at any point in the fill-and-drain tank
will be {imited to 1600°F.

The jackets around the cylindrical shell of the
tank and around the drain line, however, are not
served by two separate systems, Coolant flow
through the tank jacket will be in parallel with
coolant flow in cne set of U-tubes. The NaK will
enter the jocket around one half of the tank
circumference and will return to the coolant
channel! around the other holf of the tube sheet
periphery. Flow guides are placed along the

annular jacket to distribute the coolant flow as
required.

The two sets of U-tubes are arranged so that
one set cools the fuel zone just inside the cylin-
drical tank wall more theroughly than the alternate
set, and the coolant supply to the jacket is from
the alternate system, which is least effective in
cooling the tank wall. Aft one end of the tank,
where the fuel shell and tube sheet intersect, a
triangular “filler ring is placed to displace fuel
from this corner zone, where cooling would be
poor if one of the two coolant circuits failed. At
this end of the tank, failure of the coolant circuit
would interrupt cooling behind the tube sheet and
in the jacket. At the other end of the tank, coeling
would continue either in the jacket or behind the
tube sheet, and no filler ring is required.

Further details of the operation of this system
are given in the section “Operation of the ART"
and on the flowsheets in Appendix A.

Sampling System

Samples of the barren molten salt will be token

immediately after ‘‘shakedown’’ operation of the

ART by pressurization of the molten salt through
a heated Inconel tube from the fill-and-drain tank
into a detachable sample receiver. Additional
samples will be taken during enrichment in the
same manner fo determine the homogeneify of
mixing and the concentration of uranium in the
mixture.

Samples of the molten fuel mixture will also be
taken after nuclear power operation. These samples
will also be transferred through heated Inconel
lines into sample receivers, but, because of the
high level of radioactivity in the fuel, the operation
is to be accomplished by remote control, and the
lines and receivers must be shielded. To prevent
premature activation of the sompling valve, a
frangible disk valve will be included in each
sample transfer line.

A total of five postpower samples may be taken.
The five receivers will be encased in the same
lead shielding unit, which will be removed after
the entire ART operation is completed.

Fuel Recovery System

After completion of ART operation, the fuel will
be drained into the fill-and-drain tank and held
there for a period of several days to allow fission-
product decay ond the consequent lowering of
decay heat production. The fuel will then be
transferred into the fuel recovery tank for delivery
te the recovery and reprocessing facility.

The fuel recovery tank will consist of four,
interconnected, approximately 9-ft lengths of 8-in.-
IPS Inconel pipe furnished with elecirical heaters.
The assembly is designed for cooling by radiation
and natural convection to the atmosphere. It will
be shielded with approximately 10 in. of lead.
The molten fue! will be transferred to the tork
through a heated Inconel line containing a frangible
disk valve and an open bismuth valve. When the
transfer is completed, the bismuth valve will be
closed and both the transfer line and the helium
line will be severed, as will all heater and thermo-
couple leads. The assembly will then be lifted
out of the cell and loaded on a truck for delivery
to the recovery facility. The assembly will
include a transfer line and the other necessary
service connections for use in the course of
recovery operations.

HEAT EXCHANGERS AND HEAT DUMPS

The spherical-shell fuel-to-NaK heat exchanger,
which mckes possible the compact layout of the
reactor heat exchanger assembly, is based on the

35
use of tube bundles curved in such a way that the
tube spacing will be uniform, irrespective of
latitude.” The individual tube bundles terminate
in header drums. This arrangement focilitates
assembly because small tube-to-header bundles
can be assembled, made leaktight, and inspected
much more easily than can one large unit. Fur-
thermore, these tube bundles give a rugged,
flexible construction that is admirably suited to
service in which large cmounts of differential
thermal expansion must be expected. The config-
uration of the heat exchanger tube bundles is
illustrated in Fig. 17.

The heat removed from the fuel by the NaK will
be transferred to air in the NaK-to-air radictors,
which will be installed in a heat-dump system
designed to simulate the turbojet engines of the
full-scale aircraft in a number of important respects,
such as thermal inertia, Nal holdup, and basic
fabricational methods. The round-tube and plate-
fin radiator cores are fabricated of type 310
stainless-steel-clad copper fins spaced 15 per
inch and mounted on % 6in.-0D fnconel tubes
placed on %-in. square centers. he tubes are
welded ond brazed into round header drums. The
individual radiator cores consist of twe halves
15 by 30 in. The fin matrix depth in the air flow
direction is 5.33 in. A typical radiator is illustrated
in Fig. 18.

The basic requirement of the heat-dump system
is to provide heat-dump capacity equivalent to
60 Mw of heat with ¢ mean temperature level of
1300°F in the Nal system. The NaK will be
circulated through eight separate systems. Four
wifl constitute the main heat-dump system, two
wil serve the reflector-moderator cooling system,
and two will serve the fuel fill-and-drain tank.

In the main system a group of four NaK fill-and-
drain tanks will be used. The tanks will be pres-
surized to force the NaK into the main cooling
circuit. The 12 tube bundles of the fuel-to-NgK
heat exchanger will be manifelded in four groups
of three each. The NaK will flow from these tube
bundles out fo the radiators, which will be arranged
in four vertical banks with four radiators in each
bank. The NaK will flow upward through the
radiator bank to the pumps. A small NaK bypass
flow around the radiators will pass through «
cold trap in order to maintain a low oxygen concen-

tration in the NaK. (For details of the NgK systems
see Appendix A, Flow Diagram 6.)

The two independent reflector-moderator hect-
dump systems (referred to on Flow Diagram 6,
Appendix A, os the Auxiliary System) will be
essentially similar to the main NaK system except
thet their combined capacity will be about one-
third that of one of the four circuits of the main
heat-dump system. The NaK will be circulated to
both the Na-to-NaK heat exchangers in the top of
the reactor, where the two NaK streams will pick
up from the sodium the heat generated in the island
and the reflector. The two NaK streams will pass
to small NaK-to-air radiators, where they will be
cooled and returned fo their respective pump
suctions. A bypass cold trap will be included in
each system, os in the main NoK systems, while

a single fill-and-drain tank will serve both systems.

Four axial-flow blowers will force 300,000 cfm
of air (which expands to 6.7 x 10° cfm when heated
to 750°F) through the radiators and out through
a 10-ft-dio discharge stack 78 ft high. Since the
axial-flow blowers will stall and surge if throttled,

control will be accomplished through bypassing a

portion of the air around the radiators. The heat-
dump rate will be modulated by varying the amount
of air bypassed through a set of controllable
louvers mounted in such a way as to bleed air
from the plenum chamber between the blowers and
the radiators. The arrangement will include louvers
to block off the air passage to the radiators and
louvers in the bypass duct; one set will be
opening while the other is closing. This arrange-
ment should give good centrol of the heat [oad
from zero to 110% of the design load. Since each
blower will be driven with an a-c motor independ-
ently of the others, the heat-dump capacity can
also be increased in increments of 25% from zero
to full load by changing the number of blowers
used.

Heat barriers mounted on both sides of the ra-
diators will be required in order to minimize heat

losses during warmup operations. Warmup wiil be"

accomplished by energizing the NaK pumps and
driving them at part or full speed. As a result of
fluid frictional losses approximately 400 hp must
be put into the pumps in the NaK circuits and will
appear as heat in the fluid pumped. A mechanical
power input of 400 hp to the NaK pumps will
produce a heat input in the NaK system of approxi-
mately 300 kw. This should be enough to heat
the system quite satisfactorily if the radiator

cores are blanketed to prevent excessive heat
losses. However, electrical heaters will be avail-
able on the NaK [ines so that the NaK pumps can
be run at one-half speed to reduce stresses and
wear during zero- and low-power operation. Rela-
tively simple sheet stainless steel doors with
3.0 in. of thermal insulation will, when closed
over both faces of a radiator (100-f2 inlet-face
area) filled with 1100°F NoK, reduce the heat loss
there to about 30 kw.

The heat appearing in the reflector-moderator
will be about 3.5% of the reactor power output.
The ccoling circuit will also remove heat from the
core shells and the pressure shell, and therefore
the total amount of heat to be removed from this
cooling circuit will be ebout 10% of the reactor
output. This must be removed at a mean NaK
circuit temperature of about 1050°F. Four ra-
diators that have inlet faces 2 x 2.5 ft each and
the same basic geometry as that used for the main
heat dumps will be employed. These radiators
will be equipped with louvers and heat-barrier
doors like those used on the main NaK radiators
and will be supplied with air from the same air
duct (see Flow Diagram 6, Appendix A).

38

The two independent heat-dump systems for
heating and cooling the fuel fifl-and-drain tank
{referred to on Flow Diagram 6, Appendix A, as
the Special Systems) will also be essentially
similar to the main NaK system. The two NaK-to-
air radiators in these systems will be served by
individual air blowers. When the systems are to
be used for adding heat to the fuel in the fill-and-
drain tank to preheat the tank for filling or to
maintain the fuel above its melting temperature,
they will be capable of heating the tank to 1250°F.
The systems will also be ready at any time to
remove fission-product-decay heat from the fuel.

OFF-GAS SYSTEM

The fission-product gases which will be purged
from the fuel in the fuel expansion tank are to be
continuously removed from the fuel system to a
water-cooled charcoal adsorber, in which the gases
will, in effect, be ‘held up'’ a sufficiently long
period of time for safe discharge to the stack. In
the fuel expansion tank the gases will be diluted
with 1000 to 5000 liters of helium per day and will
be bled first through a water-cooled vapor trap (to
remove ZrF, vapor) and then outside the reactor
and cell through on empty pipe inte a charcogl-
filled pipe in a water-filled tank. The empty pipe
was provided to permit some decay of the gaseous
activity so that when it is subsequently adscrbed
by the charcoal the resultant heat can be satisfac-
torily transferred to the water surrounding the
charcoal-filled pipe, There will be sufficient
charcoal to assure a 48-hr holdup of K¢88, which
will be the only gaseous fission product with
significant activity after passage through the
charcoal. Experimental work has indicated thot
64 ft3 of charcoal will be required. Two parallel
charcoal adsorber systems are provided.

Provisions have also been made for bleeding
the cell atmosphere through an auxiliary charcoal
bed in the event that a leak occurs in the reactor
off-gas system within the cell. The charcoal bed
in this auxiliary vent system will be bypassed
during normal operation for disposing of instrument
bleed gases.

Four bypass loops will be provided in the two
off-gas systems, one before and one after the
charcoal section of each system, so that the
activity in the isolated gos samples can be counted.
Further, the vent lines to the stack will be mon-
itored to determine whether the gas may be safely

 

 
 

 

discharged. The system will operate at o pres-
sure slightly above atmospheric and will not
require pumps.

Except for the equipment within the reactor cell
and in the water tank (containing the empty and
the charcoal-filied pipes), which will be buried
in the ground, all components of the off-gas system
are to be housed in o special building provided
for that purpose at the southwest corner of the
ART building, A fundamental design criterion
is that access to this “off-gas shack’ should not
be limited by radioactivity from any other part
of the system but that the shack should be isclated
in the event of a leck of gaseous activity therein.

In the design of the off-gas system the calcy-
lations that were made!®~12 were strictly theoret-
ical, but they were strengthened by the operating
experience which had been obtained on a similar
adsorber system used with the HRE. In particular,
flow vs pressure-drop date and flow vs breakthrough
times in charcoal adsorbers were obtained from
HRE experience.'® Experimental dota'4 on the
adsorptivity of charcoal indicate that the design
of the ART adsorber is conservative. Details of
the system are presented on Flow Diagram 3 in

Appendix A.

AIRCRAFT-TYPE SHIELD

The most promising of the several shielding
arrangements that were considered for the ART
seems to be the one which is functionally the same
as the arrangement for an aircraft requiring a unit
shield — a shield designed to give ~10 r/hr at
50 ft from the center of the reactor. Such a shield
is not far from being both the lightest and the most
compact that has been devised. It will make use
of noncritical materials that are in good supply,
and it will provide useful performance data on the
effects on the radiation dose levels of the release
of delayed neutrons and decay gammas in the heat
exchanger, the generation of secondary gammas
throughout the shield, etc. While the complication

of detailed instrumentation within the shield does
not appear to be warranted, it will be extremely
worth while to obtain radiation-dose-level data at
representative points around the periphery of the
shield, particularly in the vicinity of the ducts
ond of the pump and the expansion tank region.

The shield for the reactor will have some charac-
teristics that will be peculiar to this particular
reactor configurction, The thick reflector was
selected on the basis of shielding considerations.
Use of a thick reflector is based on two major

by a layer of boron-bearing material will attenuate

reasons:

the neutron flux to the point that the secondary
gamma flux can be reduced to a value about equal
to that of the core gamma radiation; it will also
reduce the neutron leakage flux from the reflector
into the heat exchanger to about the level of that
from the delayed neutrons which will appear in
the heat exchanger from the circulating fuel. An
additional advantage of the thick reflector is that
90.8% of the energy developed in the core will
appear as heat in the high-temperature zone within
the pressure shell. This means that very little
of the energy produced by the reactor will have
to be disposed of with a parasitic cooling system
ot a low-temperature level. The material in the
intermediate heat exchanger is
about 70% as effective as water for the removal
of fast neutrons; so it too is of value from the
shielding standpoint. The delayed neutrons from
she circulating fuel in the heat exchanger region
might appear to pose a serious handicap. However,
they will have an attenuation length much sherter
than the corresponding attenuation
radiation from the core. Thus, from the outer
surface of the shield, the intermediate heat ex-
changer will appear as a much less intense source
of neutrons than the more deeply buried reactor

heat exchanger will be about equally as important
as the secondary gammas from the beryllium and
the reflector shell.

Thermal insulation 0.5 in. thick will separate
the hot reactor pressure shell from the gamma
shield, which will be a foyer of lead 4.3 in. thick.
The lead, in turn, will be surrounded by a 32-in.-
thick region of borated water. The slightly pres-
surized water shield will be contained in an
cluminum tonk. Cooling of the lead shield will
be effected by circulation of woter through coils
embedded in the lead. The borated water shield

39
will also be cooled by water circulated in coils
submerged in the boroted water and by thermal
convection of the atmosphere in the reactor as-
sembly cell.

An opening will be made at the bottom of the
shield for filling and draining of the reactor. The
fuel fill-and-drain tank will be shielded with 10 in.
of lead to reduce the dose to 1 r/hr at the shield
surface one week after full-power operation. The
resulting shield weight for a 13-f% capacity tank
will be about 30 tons.

CONTROLS AND INSTRUMENTATION

The early effort by ORNL personnel to develop
the circulating-fuel type of aircraft reactor was
motivated in part by a desirable control feature
of such reactors — the inherent stability of the
reactor at design point that results from the neg-
ative fuel and over-all temperature coefficients of
reactivity. In a power plant with this characteristic
the nuclear power source will be a slave to the
turbojet load with but a minimum of external control
devices.

This predicted master-slave relation between
the load and the power source was verified by the
ARE. Work with an electronic simulator indicates
that the ART should behave in essentially the
same way. Controlwise, the power plant consists
of the nuclear source, the heat dump (in the case
of the ART), and the coupling between source
and sink {the NaK circuit). Control at design
point can be effected to some extent by nuclear
means at the reactor, by changing the coupling
(i.e., changing the NaK flow) or by changing the
load (i.e., the heat dump from the NaK radiators).

For the ART at design point the regulating rod
will be used mainly for adjusting the reactor mean
fuel temperature. In particular, an upper tempera-
ture limit will cause the regulating rod to insert,
and therefore the fuel outlet temperature should
not appreciably exceed 1600°F, even in transients.
This limit will override any normal demand for
rod withdrawal. Furthermore o low NaK outlet
tempercture from the heat-dump radiators will
automatically decrease the heat lcad to keep the
lowest NaK temperature of the system at no less
than 1070°F. This lower temperature limit will
override all other demands for power.

Control of the ART falls in thiee different
categories of operation: stortup, operation be-
tween startup and appreciable power (about 10%
of design point), and operation in the range from

40

10% to full power. For the second and third of
these categories the nature of the reactor and
power plant is so different from that of conven-
tional high-flux reactors that control must be
based on inherent characteristics of the reactor
to a large extent rather than on conventional
reactor-contro! practice. Control at startup utilizes,
in principle, old reactor-control practice with
short-period ““scrams’’ that are conventional.
Experimentation will take place primarily in the
startup and design-point regions. In the infer-
mediate region between these two, little testing
will be done.

Fission chambers and compensated ion chambers
will be located beneath the reactor shell just
outside the lead region. The region around the
fill-and-drain pipe will be filled with moderator
material through which cylindrical holes for these
chambers will run radially out on lines which
intersect at a point below the center of the reactor.
The chamber sensitivities will be adequate for
the entire range of nuclear operations.

The contrel system is designed te provide auto-
matic corrective action for emergencies requiring
action too rapid to permit operator deliberation.
Automatic interlocks will prevent inadvertent
dangerous operation, with minimum operator limita-
tion. Operation in the design power range will
be independent of nuclear instrumentation during
power transients. Three classes of emergencies
have been provided for.

Class I. — Any of the following events will cause
the rod to be automatically and completely inserted
at a rate of 1% Ak/k in 8 sec:

I. stoppage of either sodium pump,

2. stoppage of either fuel pump,

3. drop in fuel or sodium liquid levels in the ex-
pansion tanks when pumps are operating at
design point,

4. failure of the oil system to the sodium or fuel
pumps,

5. leakage of fuel into NaK or NaK into fuel,

6. failure of commercial power or locally gen-
erated power.

At the same time one-half the blowers will be shut
off to reduce the heat load. The load will then
be further reduced by the radiator shutter auto-
matically closing in response to a 1070°F low-
signal for the NoK-to-gir radiator outlet
temperature. Dumping of the fuel will not be
automatic but will probably be initiated by the
operator.

Class II. — Any of the following events will
cause the rod to be automatically inserted af a
rate of 1% Ak/k in 8 sec:

1. stoppage of any NaK circuit,

2. leakage of NaK to the atmosphere,

3. trouble in the off-gas system (to be defined),
4. maximum fuel temperature greater than 1650°F,
5 temperature greater than

maximum sodium

1300°F,

6. maximum sodium temperature greater thon
1250°F when either set of sodium-to-NaK
radiator louvers is wide open,

7. reactor on positive period of less than 3 sec,

8. fill-and-drain tank mean temperature grecter
than 1300°F or less than 1100°F,

9. failure of the oil system to any NaK pump,

10. rod-drive trouble.

Class HI. ~ lt is planned that the operator will
be warned of any of the following events, but no
cutomatic corrective action will take place:

1. leakage of sodium into fuel or fuel into sodium,

2. lowering of the water level in the outer cell,

3. excessive radiation level in the cell as deter-
mined by monitors,

excessive humidity in the cell,

excessive rod temperature,

excessive chamber temperature,

. oxygen in the cell.

Lists of the instruments for the ART have been
prepared that give the following information for
each required measurement: type of instrument
pickup, location of pickup, type of presentation,
reading location, range, and accuracy. The
necessity for using an instrument was determined
by whether it would be required for the safe and
orderly conduct of the test, for providing sufficient
information for evaluation of test results, and for
providing information net otherwise available.
Five stations have been provided in the ART
building at which instruments will be read: the
control room, the information room, the auxiliary
equipment panel, the vent house, ond the temporary
panel for fuel sampling and recovery.

"All instruments pertinent to the nuclear perform-

ance of the reactor, as well as to the control of

equipment which affects nuclear
performance, are located in the control room.

The instruments required for determination of

reactor power and heat exchanger and radiator
performance are located in the information room.

In general, operating instruments for auxiliary

systems, such as water, hydraulic fluid, lubricating

NO

all process

oil, gas, etc., as well as for the NaK system and
alt pumps, will be confined te the ouxiliory equip-
ment panel. A few pertinent instruments, as well
as a number of alarms, are duplicated in both the
control room and the cuxiliary equipment panel.
With a few minor exceptions, all heater controls
and associated temperature instruments are located
in the basement on the cuxiliary equipment ponel.
Off-gas system temperatures will be recorded in
the vent house to aveid lines being run to the
information room. The temporary panel (for fuel
sampling and recovery) will be located on the main
floor just outside the cell and will be connected by
temporary lines to equipment within the cell as
required to effect the fuel sampling and fuel

recovery operations.

AUXILIARY SYSTEMS
Helium Supply System

Helium is required in the ART principaily be-
cause of a need for a flushing gas for removing
fission gases, for an inert atmosphere over the
fuel, sodium, and NaK, ond for o pressurizing
medium for forcing fuel and NaK to and from their
respective fill-and-drain tanks into the reactor
system. Since no two of these three uses of helium
will be concurrent, the helium consumption rate
will be low. Therefore the helium is to be supplied
from 12 cylinders monifolded into two banks by a
high-pressure manifeld with isolating valves and
pressure-reducing valves for each bank. This
will allow use from either of the two banks while
the depleted bank is being replaced. (For details
of this system see Flow Diagram 9, Appendix A.)

Nitrogen Supply System

Nitrogen will be required for filling the recctor
cell and for operating the pneumatic instruments.
The nitrogen atmosphere in the cell is a safety
measure. In the event of a simultaneous sodium
and water leak from the reactor intc the cell, it
is important thot the oxygen concentration of the
ambient atmosphere be kept low enough for no
detonation of the hydrogen-oxygen mixture to
occur. The lower combustibility limit for hydrogen-
nitrogen-oxygen mixtures is obtained at 5% oxygen.
To ensure a substantial margin of safety, it has
been decided that the oxygen concentration in
the reactor cell will be kept to less than 1%.

The oxygen will be removed ‘initially from the
cell by the cell pressure being reduced with «

41
vacuum pump to a maximum of 0.74 psia and the
cell being repressurized with dry nitrogen to
atmospheric pressure. The dry nitrogen bleed from
the pneumatic instruments will act as a continuous
purge, which will keep the oxygen content of the
nitrogen low. The bleed flow is estimated to be
a maximum of 7 scfm. {For details of this system
see Flow Diagram 10, Appendix A.)

A permanent storage tank with a capacity of
10,300 scf ot 1000 psi and a pressure-reducing
station with two reducing valves that are available
at the site will comprise an adequate system for
supplying the instruments with the 7 cfm required
during the test. A trailer will be used to fill the
reactor cell initially.

Electrical Power System, Distribution,
and Auxiliary Equipment

The electrical power for the ART will be sup-
plied by two separate sources. One will be a
commercial (TVA) source and the other will be
a set of diesel-driven generators. In case of a
power failure for any reason, no effort will be made
to continue to operate the reactor at power; that
is, a power failure or an equipment failure will
lead to an orderly shutdown of the reactor. The
main power loads are:

I. the two fuel pumps,

2. the two sodium pumps,

3. the two NaK pumps in the reflector-mederator

cooling system,

4. the four NaK pumps in the fuel cooling system,
5. the two Nak pumps in the fill-and.drain tank

cooling system,

6. the four radiator blowers in the main duct,
7. the two radiator blowers in the special duct,
8. the battery for control and instrument circuits,
9. the pump lube cil systems,

10. the heater and auxiliary loads.

The relation between the various pumps is such
that one fuel pump, one sodium pump, one NaK
pump in the reflector-moderator cooling system,
two NaK pumps in the fuel coeling system, and
two radiator blowers should be connected to one
power source. These major pieces of equipment
will not have alternate power sources.

A station-type battery will be provided, and the
circuit will be arranged so that the battery will
float on the line at all times to keep a full charge.
The battery will be used to supply the necessary
control and instrument circuits in case of a power
outage. Some emergency lighting will alse be fed
off the battery.

42

Fuel and Sedium Pump Lubricating
and Cooling Oil Systems

The lubricating and cooling oil systems for the
fuel and sodium pumps are to be sealed so that
they will serve as secondary, or backup, containers
for the gaseous radioactive products which might
feak from the fuel or sodium systems through the
primary rotating face seal between the reactor
system cover gas and the lubricating oil surrounding
the lower seal, The pressure in the lubricating
oil system will be a slave to the pressure of the
process system through seal-balancing control for
holding the differential pressure across the lower
seal to a minimum and in a direction to cause
leakage of oil into the system rather than gases
into the oil. The oil leakage will be trapped and
then removed by a separate system. All parts of
the system external to the test cell must be
capable of withstanding pressures as high as
200 psig for periods of up te 1 hr without failure.

Process Water System

The ART process water is to be supplied by an
“open,’”’ once-through system with two parallel
pumps to supply pressure, There will be one supply
header and one exit header, and each will penetrate
the cell wall. The process circuits will join these
headers within the cell to minimize the number of
cell penetrations, The flow through each circuit
will be preset before the cell is sealed, and thus
there will be no need for remote conirol or remote
flow measurement. The use of the open cycle
eliminates the need for additional water pumps,
heat exchangers, etc., and the consequent neces-
sity of canning the pumps to withstand the cell
disaster pressure. Check valves, backed up by
motor-driven cutoff vaives, will be provided in the
intet lines through the cell. The check valves,
backed up by the cutoff valves, will prevent the
escape of the gaseous activity that would be
present in the water lines within the cell if a
reactor catastrophe caused the water lines within
the cell to rupture. Provisions will be made to
assure uninterrupted flow, since water flow to the
lead shielding must be maintained during all periods
when the reactor and dump tank are at operating
temperature so that the lead will not be melted.

Water will be required within the cell for filling
the reactor water shield and for cooling the reactor
and fuel-dump-tank lead shields, the two instrument
pods, and the reactor and fuel-dump-tank vapor
traps. Outside the cell, water cooling will be

 
 

 

provided for the lubricotien and hydraulic systems,
the charcoal adsorber, the penthouse space cooler,
and the NaK cold traps and for filling the water
annulus of the cell.

THE FACILITY
The Building

The building constructed in 1952 to house the
ARE is being modified to provide the space and
facilities required for the ART. An addition has
been constructed af the south end of the ARE
building to effect a 64-ft extension of the original
106-ft-long building. The shielded reactor assembly
will be installed in the containing cell that has
been provided in the addition for this purpose.
Such an arrangement will permit the use of services
and facilities that were provided for the original
installation. Items such as the control room, of-
fices, change rocems, teilets, storage orea, water
supply, power supply, portions of experimental
test pits, access roads, security fencing, and
security lighting have been incorporated in ART
plans.

The plan and section drawings of the facility
are shown in Figs. 19 and 20. The floor level of
the addition is at the ARE basement-floor grade
{ground level at this end of the building), and the
cell for housing the reactor assembly is sunk in
the floor. The reactor ceil is located in approx-
imately the southwest quarter of a 42-ft-wide by
64-ft-long high-bay extension and is directly in
line with the ARE experimental bay. The reactor
assembly will be positioned so that the top of the
shield wil! be below building floor elevation,

The south wall of the ARE experimental bay has
been removed, and the overhead crane facility has
been revised by the installation of a 30-ton-capacity
crane, in addition to the existing 10-ton crane, to
permit use of the experimental pits for installation
of auxiliary equipment and possibly for underwater
reactor disassembly work after reactor operation.
Also, the truck door in the north wall of the building
has been enlarged to provide a large entry door
to the ART area. Field maintenance and laboratory
facilities have been installed in the area east of
the new bay and south of the low bay of the older
part of the building.

The Reactor Assembly Cell

The cell designed for housing the reactor as-
sembly is shown in Fig. 21. The cell consists of
an inner and an outer tank. The heat-dump equip-

ment will be located outside the cell, but nearby.
The space between the two tanks is 36 in. and
will be filled with water. The inner tank will be
sealed so that it con contain the reactor in an
inert atmosphere of nitrogen at 5 psig. The tank
has been built to meet ASME code requirements
for unfired pressure vessels designed for a 200-
psig operating pressure. The outer tank serves
merely as a water container,

The inner tank will be approximately 24 ft in
diometer with a straight section 12 ft long and
a hemispherical bottom and top. The outer tank,
which is cylindrical, is 30 ft in diameter and about
47.5 ft in height. When the reactor is to be operated
at high power, the space between the tanks and
above the inner tank will be filled with weter for
carrying off the heat given off by decay gamma
activity in the event of an accident so severe as
to cause a meltdown of the reactor.

About 13 ft of the outer tank will be above floor
This portion of the tank, as well as the
top hemisphere of the inner tank, will not be
attached until completion of the reactor instcliation
and preliminary shakedown testing. Since the
shielding at the reactor and for other radicactive
components will be quite effective, it will be
possible for a man to enter the inner tank through
o manhole for inspection or repair work, If the
reactor has been operated at moderately high power,
the fuel will have to be drained. If the repair
work requires a relatively long time, the nitrogen
atmosphere will be replaced with air.

The unshielded reactor assembly will weigh
approximately 11,500 ib, the lead gamma shield
will weigh approximately 26,000 Ib, and the water
in the shield will weigh approximately 38,500 Ib.
The shielded reactor assembly will be mounted in
the inner tank on vertical columns with the reactor
off center 3 ft from the vessel axis and abcut 7 ft
above an open-grated floor. This positiening pro-
vides the space that will be needed for the location
of the fuel fill-and-drain tank, prepower and post-
power sampling systems, fuel recovery tank, nuclear
instrumentation, and enriching equipment. The
off-center location alse serves te minimize the
length of the NaK piping.

grade,

The NaK and off-gas piping connected to the
reactor will pass through a thimble-type passage
or bulkhead with a bellows-type expansion joint
in the double-walled cell. The opening will be
covered with a conical thermal sleeve which will
be welded to the pressure cell wall. The piping

will be anchored to the thermal sleeve. The
annular space between the NaK and the off-gas
piping and the thimble-type passage will be filled
with insulation. Auxiliary service pipes and tubes
connected to the reactor will pass through three
junction panels located on the west side of the
cell. The openings will be covered with stiff
plates which will be welded to the pressure-cell
wall, The bulkhead between the double-walled
cell is a bellows-type seal.

Five doubly sealed junction panels for controls
and instrumentation have been installed through
the tank below the building floor grade on the east
side of the tank as a part of another bulkhead
system to pass the wires, pipes, tubes, etc.
required for the circuits and systems. The volume
within the instrument and electrical wiring bulk-
heads will then be maintained at a pressure of
200 psig to prevent outleakage from the inner
tank, even in the event of a disaster. The various
thermocouples, power wiring, etc., will be installed
on the reactor assembly in the shop and fitted
with disconnect plugs so that they can be plugged
into the panel in a short period of time after the
reactor assembly has been lowered into position
in the test facility. This will minimize the amount
of assembly work required in the field.

Manholes 5 ft in diameter have been installed
in the upper portion of the containers. The manhole
in the water tank is located just above the flange
on the inner tank to allow passage through both

container walls ond thus provide an entrance to
the inner tank for use after placement of the top.
Sufficient catwalks, ladders, and hoisting equip-
ment will be installed within the inner tank to
provide easy access for servicing all equipment.

The control tunnel surrounds 180 deg of the
north side of the cell, with all junction panels
exiting into the control tunnel which extends to
the auxiliary equipment pit (formerly the ARE
storage pit). The pit and the adjoining basement
area will include such items as the lubricating
oil pumps and coolers, hydraulic oil pumps, relays,
switch gear, voltage regulators, and auxiliary
equipment control panels.

The Shielding Experiment Facility

Tests made at the Tower Shielding Facility
indicated that provision should be made for the
measurement of the gamma-ray spectrum of the
ART as a function of the angle of emission from
the reactor shield. Therefore five collimator tubes
have been provided to coliimete four beams ra-
diating from an equatorial point at the surface of
the water shield at angles of from § to 70 deg from
the radial direction and one beam from an equatorial
point at the surface of the reactor pressure shell.
The latter beam will be used only during low-power
operation. The layout required for providing these
beams is shown in Fig. 22. In addition to the
facilities shown in Fig. 22, ¢ gamma-ray dosimeter
will be located on the roof above the reactor.

DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT STUDIES

FUEL DEVELOPMENT

A thorough survey of materials that appeared to
be promising as heat transfer fluids was presented
in ORNL-360.7 The first requirement is that the
fluid must be liquid and thermally stable over the
temperature range from 1000 to 1800°F. A melting
point considerably below 1000°F would be prefer-
able for ease in handling, but a substance that
would be liquid at room temperature would be even
better. Other desirable choracteristics are low
neutron absorption, low viscosity, high volumetric
specific heat, and high thermal conductivity.
Above all, it must be possible to contain the
liquid in a good structural material at high tempera-
tures without serious corrosion or mass transfer of
the structural material. If the heat transfer fluid
is to serve also as a circulating fuel, it must be a
suitable vehicle for uranium; that is, the solubility
of uranium and its effect on the properties of the
fluid must be considered.

To be suitable for a high-temperature, liguid-
fueled, epithermal reactor, a fuel system must meet
several stringent requirements. The liquid must
contain a sufficient concentration of a uranium
compound for a critical mass to be provided in the
core volume and must melt at a temperature sub-
stantially below the heat exchanger outlet tem-
perature. It must consist of elements of low ab-
sorption cross section for thermal neutrons and
must consist solely of compounds which are
thermally stable ot temperatures in excess of the
core outlet temperature. A high thermal coefficient
of expansion is desirable as an aid to selfregulation
of the power level. In addition it must be stable
to the intense radiation field and must tolerate
the fission process and the accumulation of fission
preducts without serious adverse effect on its
physical, heat transfer, and chemical properties.
Of the many fluid materials which have been con-
sidered, molten fluorides are the only fluids which
seem to be generally suitable as aircraft reactor
fuels; 2 a number of fluorides of low cross-section
elements appear to be particularly promising.?

A mixture of NaF, ZrF , and UF, essentially a
solution of Na,UF, in NaZrF,, containing 5.5
mole % of UF, proved to be adequate as fuel for
the ARE. Mixtures of this general composition
are relatively noncorrosive to low-chromium nickel.
base alloys and would appear to be adequate for
use in the ART, but the melting point, vapor
pressure, and heat transfer properties are inferior
to those obtainable frem some other fluorides.

An improvement in melting point and a slight
improvement in vapor pressure ond viscosity can
be obicined by the addition of RbF to the NaF-
ZrF ,-UF system. However, the benefits obtained
would seem to be marginal, considering the high
cost of RbF and the added complexity of the
system, unless very high uranium concentrations
{above 6.5 mole %) are required for criticality.

Substantially lower melting points and vapor
pressures con be obtained at some loss in heat
transfer properties and at a slight increase in
corrosion and mass transfer rates with mixtures of
NaF-BeF ,.UF, as fuel. Some improvemen' over
this mixture results if LiF-BeF,.UF, is used. In
view of the diminished heat fransfer performance,
the toxicity of BeF,, and the cost of the required
Li7, neither mixture appears to offer any real
advantage over the NaF-ZrF UF, system for air-
craft reactors, as presently conceived,

A slight improvement in melting point and a very
real advantage in vapor pressure ond heat transfer
performance result from a solution of UF, in the
ternary eutectic of NaF-KF.LiF. Although such
mixtures are quite incompatible with Inconel and
similar commercial chromium-bearing nickel alloys
because of rapid mass transfer of chromium, the
advantages will almost certainly justify the cost of
the required Li’F if an adequate structural and
container material can be found.

While information on the radiation behavior of
several of these general classes of fluoride fuels
is meager, apparently there is no substantial dif-
ference among them in their stability to the radic-
tion fields and ne one of them will show a pro-
nounced advantage in response to fission or
fission-product buildup during reactor operation.

If an adequate container material becomes avail-
able, it is very likely that the NaF-KF-LiF-UF,
fuel system will be chosen for use in aircraft
reactors. As long, however, as Inconel or some
similar chromium-bearing alloy of nickel has to be

51
used as the container, the NaF-ZrF ,-UF mixture
{or some slight variant of it) will continue to be
preferred,

STRUCTURAL MATERIAL

In selecting the structural materials for the fuel
and coolant systems (which specify the structural
material for the entire reactor), the key considerc-
tions were nuclear properties, high-temperature
performance, fabricability, ovailability, and cor-
rosion resistance fo fuel and coolant. The material
was required to have both high creep strength at
high temperatures and a ductility of at least 10%
throughout the operating temperature range so that
high local thermal stresses would be relieved by
plastic flow without cracking. Also, the metal
was to be highly impermeable and weldable, with
ductility in the weld zone of at least 10% throughout
the temperature range from the melting point to
room temperature. The availability of the material
was « prime consideration, because a good assort-
ment of bar stock, tubing, and sheet is essential in
a development program. These considerations led
to the use of Inconel for the structural material of
the ARE, and it has been selected for the ART
because extensive research and development work
has net yet produced ¢ superior material in sub-
stantial quantities,

The most promising of the other materials being
considered are the nickel-molybdenum alloys.
These alleys are vastly superior in corrosion re-
sistance to the fluoride mixtures and in strength
at the temperatures of interest; however, the
commercial nickel-molybdenum alloys Hastelloys
B ond W exhibit brittleness in the temperature
range 1100 to 1500°F as a result of age-hardening.
Present indications are that this embrittlement
can be overcome by reducing the molybdenum con-
tent to 15 to 20% and controlling the amounts of
strengthening additions, such as Al, Ti, W, Nb,
Cr, ond C. If the age-hardening tendencies can be
eliminated without excessive compromise of
strength ond corrosion properties, structural ma-
terial will become avoilable that will be satis-
factory at operating temperatures up to 1700°F,

CORROSION OF STRUCTURAL MATERIALS

Extensive studies of the corrosion of Inconel by
molten fluorides, especially NaF-ZrF -UF, mi Xe
tures, have been conducted. For these studies,
static and dynamic tests were performed both out
of and in radiation fields. The tests have been
made with Inconel thermal-convection loops eper-
ated {out-of-pile} with a top temperature of 1500 to
1650°F, wall temperatures up to 1750°F, and

 

 
 

 

temperature gradients of 225 to 250°F, which ine
duce flow rates of 2 to 6 fpm in.the fluoride mix-
ture, The effects of time, temperature, purity,
ratio of surface area to volume, various additives,
valence state of the uranium, and concentration of
the uranium have been investigsted. In general,
data from the thermal-convection loops have
agreed well with the data from the forced-circulation,
high-temperature-differential loops that have been
operated out of and in radiation fields. The
velocity and Reynolds number of the circulated
fluid apparently have a very minor effect on cor-
rosion and mass transfer. |t has also been demon-
strated in in-pile ferced-circulation loops that
radiation has little effect on these Inconel-fluoride
mixture systems at power densities up to 1 kw/em3,
In the most recently operated in-pile loop, the fuel
burnup reached a level essentially the some as the
design value for the ART, This loop is being
disassembled for analysis.

Inconel, a solid-solution alloy of Ni, Cr, and
Fe, when exposed to fluoride metals is subject to
preferential leaching of chromium, which causes
the formation of voids in the metal. The voids are
subsurface, are not interconnected, and are found
to occur both within the grains ond at grain bound-
aries, The selective leaching of the chromium
occurs not because of physical solubility of chro-
mium metal in molten fluorides but by chemical
reaction of the chromium with oxidizing agents
present in the fluoride mixture or on the original
metal surface. Accordingly, corrosion of Inconel
by the fluoride mixture is strongly dependent on
the concentration of these reducible compounds;
this dependence is emphasized as the ratio of
fluoride=mixture volume to Inconel surface area
is increased,

Typical impurities react and produce corrosion
by the following processes:

2HF + Cr® —> GF, + Hy

NiF, + Cr® —— CF, + Ni°
FeF, + Cr —> GF, + Fe®
2FefF, + 3C° —— CF, + 2Fe®
2G F, + Cr — 3CrF,

Oxide films on the metal walls react with the fuel
constituents (ZrF, or UF,) to yield structural
metal fluorides:

NiO + ZrF , —> 2NiF, + Zr0,
2Fe,0, + 3ZeF , —> 4FeF, + 37:0,
2Cr,0, + 3ZrF , —> 4CrF, + 32:0,

These structural metal fluorides ore then available
for reaction with chromium, as shown above. It is,
accordingly, necessary that the fluoride mixture
and the Inconel be of especially high purity. If
the purity specification is met and UF, is the
uranium compound used, the reaction

2UF, + Cf == GF, + 2UF,

becomes the rote-determining reaction in the cor»
rosion process.

in the thermal-convection loops, reduction of
impurities in the fluoride mixture and equilibration
of the metal surface with the UF, seem to require
200 to 250 hr and to produce void formation to a
depth of 3 to 5 mils. In the forced-circulation
loops, in which the flow rates of the fluoride mix-
ture are much higher, these reactions proceed more
rapidly but do not cause ony greater corrosion.
For a given concentration of impurities of UF, the
depth of attack varies with the ratio of surface
area to fuel volume; and, if equilibrium is estab-
lished isothermally, the corrosion is reascnably

uniform. However, in a system with a femperature
differential the hottest zone is preferentially
attacked.

When tetravaient uranium is present, the reaction
UF, + Cro=—= CF, + 2UF,

is responsible for some *‘mass transfer’ in addition
to the corrosion described above. In the mass
transfer process, chromium removed from the metal
walls in the hot zone is deposited on the metal
walls in the lower temperature regions of the sys-
tem. Since the equilibrium constant for the reaction
is temperature dependent, the reaction proceeds
slightly further to the right in the high-temperature
zone {1500°F) than in the [ow-temperature zone.
The UF, and the CrF, are soluble and therefore
move with the circulating stream to the cooler zone,
where a slight reversal of the reaction occurs and
chromium metal is formed. This type of conversion
is not readily apparent in thermal-convection loops
operated for 500 hr, because in the first 500 hr
of operation the mass transfer effect is masked by
the effects of impurities and nonequilibrium con-
ditions. In loops operated for 1500 hr, however,
the mass transfer effect is observable. It is esti-
mated that, in Inconel systems circulating a zir-
conium-base fluoride fuel mixture, corrosion by
the mass transfer mechanism will increase by
about 3 mils per 1000 hr. Data from a loop oper-
ated for over 8000 hr substantiate this view; the
total depth of attack was 25 mils, with a peak
Inconel temperature of 1500°F,

53
The corrosion attack in the ART will be greatest
in the hottest portion of the fuel circuit, and after
1000 hr of operation the attack is expected to be
about 8 to 10 mils if all the uranium is present
originally as UF. If a mixture of UF; and UF,
is used, the corrosion of Inconel by the fuel will
be decreased. For instance, after 500 hr of circu-
lation of a UF j-containing fused salt, attack of 1
to 2 mils is found, in contrast to the usual 3 to
5 mils. Experiments are under way for determining
the proper UF ;-to-UF , ratio for achieving minimum
corrosion along with adequate solubility in the
zirconium-base fluoride mixture. The UF, is not
sufficiently soluble in the NaF-ZrF, carrier to
provide a critical mass, ond plating-cut of the
uranium would also be a preblem.

it has been estoblished that the zirconium-base
fluoride mixture fuels and Inconel will be com-
patible under ART operating conditions for the
1000-hr expected life and that the attack will not
seriously weaken the reactor structure, but there
is still some concern about the corrosion of the
thin-walled (0.025-in.-thick} heat exchanger tubing.
The amount of mass transfer of chromium to the
cold leg will be so small that there will not be an
increase in pressure drop or a decrease in heat
transfer performance.

The materials competibility problem has also
been investigoted for the materials of the reflector-
moderator system in which sodium will flow in
direct contact with both beryllium and Inconel,
in such a system both temperature gradient mass
fransferand dissimilar metal mass transfer between
the beryitium and Inconel con occur. On the basis
of numerous whirligig, thermal-convection loop,
and forced-circulation loop tests conducted on
bery!livm-sodium=incone! systems, the former does
not oppear to be a serious problem if the temperc-
ture is kept below 1300°F. The temperature
gradient mass transfer detected on the cold-leg
walls of any thermal-convection loop with a beryls
lium insert in the hot leg operated at 1300°F (cold
eg, 1100°F) for periods of 1000 hr has been less
than 200 ug per square centimeter of berylfium,
The mass transfer of Inconel by the sodium at
temperatures below 1300°F is not considered to be
a serious problem. A beryllium-sodium-Inconel
loop in which equal areas of
Inconel and beryllium were exposed to the sodium
showed no increase in mass trensfer over that
found with cli-lnconel loops. This loop was oper-
ated ot a hot-leg temperature of 1300°F for 1000 hr,

forced-circulation

54

ond a 2-mil deposit of crystals was found in the
cold leg. The crystals were nickelerich and con-
tained little or no beryllium.

Dissimilar metal mass transfer, in which the
sodium ccts as a carrier between the beryllium
and Inconel, has been found to be ¢ function of the
separation distance between the two materials.
When the beryllium and Inconel are separated by
distances of greater than 5 mils, no continuous
layers of nickel-beryllium compound are formed on
the surface of the Inconel in 1000 hr ot 1200°F,
Under these conditions a fine subsurface pre-
cipitate, probably BeNi, forms to a depth of approx-
imately 2 mils with a 5-mil separation between the
beryllium and the Inconel and to a depth of 1 mil
with a 50-mil separation.

The major compatibility problem in the reflector-
moderator system will occur in those areas where
Inconel and beryllium are in direct contact. In
1000 hr at 1200°F a 5mil layer of brittle compound
{4.5 mils of Be, Ni; 0.5 mil of BeNi) formed on
the Inconel when it was held in direct contact
with beryllium with no applied pressure. Approxi-
mately 1 mil of Inconel was consumed in the forma-
tion of this layer. At 1300°F under a contact
pressure of 500 psi a 25-mil layer of Be, Nig +
BeNi, which consumed 4 to 5 mils of Inconel, was
formed on the Inconel in 1000 hr. One possible
sclution to this problem may be to chromium-plate
the Inconel. Tests under the above conditions
{1300°F, 500 psi, 100C hr) indicate that a S-mil
chromium plate can reduce the reaction to a cone
sumption of 2 mils of Inconel.

Since the structural metal of the fuel system will
also be in contact with the sodium in the NaK in
the heat exchange systems, intensive studies are
under way on the compatibility of Inconel and
sodium under dynamic conditions at a peak sodium
temperature of 1500°F. It is believed that mass
transfer in these systems can be kept to a tolerable
minimum by the use of very pure, non-oxygen-
containing sodium and very clean metal surfaces.
In particular, it is expected that the beryllium
surfaces will remove the oxygen impurity from the
sodium and thus contribute to the reduction of mass
transfer in the scdium system,

Other structural materials have been studied or
are being studied in an attempt to find ¢ material
superior to Inconel for subsequent aircraft reactors.
The stainless steels appear to be superior in
sodium, but they are definitely inferior in the

fluoride mixtures. Hostelloy B is far superior in

 

 
 

 

the fluoride mixtures, but it has poor fabricational
qualities. Various modifications of the basic
nickel-molybdenum alloys are now being investi-
gated.

RADIATION EFFECTS ON STRUCTURAL
MATERIALS

The effects of irradiation on the corrosion of
Inconel exposed to a fluoride fuel mixture and on
the physical and chemical stability of the fuel
mixture have been investigated by irradiating
Inconel capsules filled with static fuel in the MTR
and by operating in-pile forced-circulation Inconel
loops in the LITR and in the MTR. The relatively
simple capsule tests have been used extensively
for the evaluation of new materials. The principal
variables in these tests have been flux, fission
power, time, and temperature. In a fixed neutron
flux the fission power was varied by adjusting the
uranium content of the fuel mixture. Thermal.
neutron fluxes ranging from 101} to 1014 neu-
tronssem=2esec=! and fission-power levels of
80 to 8000 w/em?® have been used in these tests.
Almost all the capsules have been irradiated for
300 hr, but in some of the recent tests the irradia-
tion period was 600 to 800 hr. After irradiation the
effects on the fuel mixture were studied by meas-
uring the pressure of the evolved gos, by determin-
ing the melting point of the fuel mixture, and by
making petrographic and chemical analyses. The
Inconel capsule was also examined for corrosion
by standard metallographic techniques.

In the many capsule tests made to date ne major
changes that can be attributed to irradiatior, other
than the normal burnup of the uranium, have occurred
in the fuel mixtures. However, the analytical
method for the determination of chromium in the
irradiated fuel mixture is being rechecked for
accuracy. The metallographic examinations of
Inconel capsules tested at 1500°F for 300 hr have
shown the corrosion fo be comparable to the corroe-
sion found under similar conditions in unirradiated
capsules, that is, penetration to a depth of less
than 4 mils, In capsules tested af a temperature
of 2000°F and above, the penetration was tc a
depth of more than 12 mils and there was grain
growth.

Three types of forced-circulation in-pile loops
have been tested. A large loop was operated in a
horizontal beam hole of the LITR. The pump for
circulating the fuel in this loop was placed outside
the reactor shield. A smaller loop, including the
pump, was operated in a vertical position in the
lattice of the LITR. A third loop was coerated
completely within a beam hole of the MTR, The
operating conditions for these loops are presented
in Table 6, and results of chemical analyses of the
fuel mixtures circulated are given in Table 7.

The LITR horizontal loop operated for 545 hr,
including 475 hr at full reactor power. The loop
generated 2.8 kw, with a maximum fission power of
400 w/em?, The Reynolds number of the circulated
fuel was 5000, and there was o temperature differ-
ential in the fuel system of 30°F. The voiume of

the loop was large, and therefore there was a
large diluticn factor, that is, the ratio of the total
system volume to the volume in the fissioning
zone. Metallographic analyses showed that there
was less than 1 mil of corrosion of the Inconel
walls of the loop. Chemical analyses showed thot
the irradiated fuel! mixture contained 200 ppm or
less Fe, Cr, and Ni. Therefore there was no evi-
dence of accelerated corrosion in this experiment,

The LITR vertical [oop operated for 130 hr, with
only 30 hr of the total operating period being at
full reactor power. The loop generated 5 kw, with
a maximum fission power of 500 w/cm3. The
Reynolds number of the fuel was 3000, and the
temperature differential was 71°F. The surface-
to-volume ratio was 20, and the dilution factor was
10. Chemical analyses showed that the irradiated
fuel contained 370 ppm Fe, 100 ppm Cr, and 50 ppm
Ni. Metallographic analysis of the loop showed
that there was less than 1 mil of corrosion at the
curved tip.

The horizontal loop inserted in the MTR (MTR
in-pile loop No. 3)? operated for 462 hr, including
271 hr at power. The loop generated 29 kw, with
a maximum power of 730 w/cm3, The Reynolds
number of the fuel was 5000, ond the temperature
differential was 175 to 200°F for 103 hr and was
100°F for 168 hr. The dilution factor was about
3.5.

Chemical analyses of fuel from MTR in-pile loop
No. 3 showed that it contained 24C ppm Fe, 50 ppm
Cr, and 100 ppm Ni. The high iron concentration
was probably caused by a sampling difficulty.

of the Inconel tubing showed that there was no
corrosion peneiration; etching revealed no attack
to a depth of more than 1 mil. A slight amount of
intergranular void formation was noted but was
neither dense nor deep. Measurements of wall
thickness did nof reveal any variations attributable
The loop was examined carefully
for effects of temperature variations between the
inside and outside walls of tubing at bends, but
no effects of overheating were observed. Samples
taken from the inlet, the center, and the exit side
of the loop had less than 1 mil of corrosion. The
low corrosion is credited to the careful temperature
control of the salt-metal interface and to the maxi-
mum wall temperature being below 1500°F at cll
times.

Future loops will be operated at higher fission
powers and therefore greater temperature differ-
entials. The dilution factors will be kept low.
New fuels and new alloys are being considered
for testing in future loops.

STRUCTURAL DESIGN ANALYSES
The Reactor

The five principal problems involved in the
structural design analysis of the ART are the
selection of the operating conditions for the reac-
tor and the definition of the accidents or failures
that might occur for which corrective action would
be possible; the determination of the mechanical
or pressure loads set up by these various operai-
ing conditions; the calculation of the correspond-
ing temperature distributions throughout the reac-
tor; the selection of suitable design criteria; and
the detailed stress analysis and structural design
of the system.

 

 
 

The proposed operating program for the ART is
based on the reactor being at temperature (1200°F
or greater) for 1500 hr. During the last 1100 hr of
this time, the reactor will be critical and wilt be
subjected to 25 full-power cycles to simulate
flight requirements. In general, the most severe
steady-state pressure loads to which the internal
structure of the reactor will be exposed will occur

10 which is referred to
£2

during full-power operation,
as the ‘‘design-point condition’’ and which serves
as the basis for steady-state-load design analysis.
Design for transient loads is based in large part
on the power-cycling conditions mentioned above
and on various unscheduled changes in power level
that will occur as corrective or safeguard action in
the event of certain accidents. Not all the pos-
sible operational situations which may arise during
the test of the ART have yet been examined from a
design viewpoint, but it is believed that those
situations which will impose the most severe re-
quirements on the structural design have already
been considered. However, if further studies
indicate the contrary, modifications will be made
in the design or constraints will be imposed on
the operational procedure. Information on tem-
perature and pressure transients to be expected
from off-design operation will be obtained from
tests performed on the ART simulator {e.g., abrupt
stoppage of several pumps).

The pressure loads within the reactor have been
determined for the design-point condition and for a
condition involving the failure of one fuel pump.
It is believed that these two situations represent
the most severe symmetric and unsymmetric in-
ternal loads to which the reactor will be exposed.
The calculation of the one-pump-cut condition was
performed in order to determine the stability of the
reflector-moderator assembly. Under this circum-
stance there would be no pressure drop through
the fuel-to-NaK heat exchangers in the circuit
supplied by the pump that failed. This condition
would result, then, in a net side load on the re-
flector of 12,400 Ib. The reflector support ring
has been designed to be stable against the re-
sultant overturning moment, and the assembly can
be expected to remain seated against the north-
head structure,

 

The mein heat exchanger headers and the core
shells are two important exceptions. The most severe
loads on these members will occur in the event of the
stoppage of a fuel pump.

For design-point operation the pressures in the
fuel and in the sodium circuits will be symmetric
with respect to the vertical axis of the reactor;
thus all resultant forces on the principal struc-
tural components (the reflector, north head, island,
pressure shell, and pressure-shell finer) will be
directed clong this axis. In oddition to these
vertical forces, horizontal reactions will occur
between the reflector shell and the pressure-sheil
liner and between the heat exchanger tubes ond
the reflector shells and the pressure-shell liner as
a result of pressure differences and differential
thermal expansion. In the heat exchanger tubes
and the thin core and reflector shells these forces
can cause large deflections and possibly buckling.

The principal forces which must be accommo-
dated at the design-point condition are the vertical
loads that will be imposed by the fuel. These
loads consist of three components: forces result-
ing from pressure drops in the fuel passages,
weight forces, and buoyant forces. in the reflec-
tor-moderator assembly the pressure-drop force
will be 58,000 Ib, the weight 3,000 Ib, and the
buoyant force 4,700 tb. The net force will be up-
ward and will press the reflector against the north
head, which, in turn, will transmit the force to the
pressure shell.

There will also be an upwérd thrust of 20,900 Ib
on the north-head region of the pressure shell from
the combined action of pressure, weight, ond
buoyant forces on the heat exchanger. The heat
exchanger and reflector forces will be brought into
balance through the action of corresponding pres-
sure forces on the inside of the pressure shell
(transmitted by the liner), which will force the
pressure shell downward (Fig. 23). Similar buoy-
ant, weight, and pressure-drop forces will also act
on the island assembly, but these forces will be
relatively small and can be carried by the shell
structure without the aid of special structural
members.

Calculations are being made for determining the
three-dimensional temperature distributions through-
out the sodium circuit, the fuel, and the principal
structural members for the various operating condi-
tions of the reactor. In the initial design studies,
thermal loads and stress values were used that
were based on very preliminary estimates of the
temperature structure, and therefore the very de-
tailed analysis being made will serve as o check
on the coolant-flow provisions. It will also pro-
vide more accurate estimates of the thermal-stress
distribution in critical members.

Precise calculations of the temperature profiles
throughout the reactor require detailed information
on the energy depecsition from radiation and neu-
tron reactions and on the temperature structure
along the boundaries of the fluid passages. In-
formation on the energy deposition is to be ob-
tained by two independent methods: a buildup-
factor technique in preparation at Prait & Whitney
and a Monte Carle method developed at ORNL.
The nuclear reaction data required for these pro-
grams are based on the two-dimensional multigroup
flux calculations supplied by the Curtiss-Wright
Corporation. The dual program has been initiated
because the Monte Carlo method, although more
accurate, will be several months in preparation,
and it is believed that the relatively quick Prott &
Whitney method will suffice for preliminary three-
dimensional data. Finally, a more accurate picture
of the temperature profiles through the fuel will
be obtained from analyses of the results of the
high-temperature critical experiment and of the
tests of the half-scale model of the ART core,
which utilizes a velume heat source to simulate
the fission heating.

The utilization of the tempercture and load dis-
tribution information in the design cnalysis of the
reactor system poses some difficulties in a broad
technological sense because of the lack of an
established design philosophy for high-temperature
operation. In general, relatively little design ex-
perience has been acquired in providing for the
effects of thermal cycling, strain cycling, creep
buckling, and thermal relaxation.

Suitable design criteria are being formulated for
the ART by combining information obtained from

materials testing programs, component festing
programs, and the Engineering Test Unit (see
Part 1V). In the materials testing programs, data

are being obtained on the properties of Inconel
and beryllium at the temperatures of interest in
order to acquire insight into the nature of the
basic thermal phenomenon involved.

Data on the creep and tensile properties of the
two materials, their behavior under strain cycling,
and their relaxation properties are of particular
interest. The creep and strength data'! are re-
quired for the design of members that will be sub-
jected to continuous loads over prolonged periods

of time {e.g., loads resulting from operating pres-

related according to the Coffin formulation
will serve as the basis for the design analysis of
structures which will be repeatedly subjected to
mechanical or thermol loads that will produce
plastic deformation in the material. The reloxation
dota'4 are to be used mainly to determine the
amount of plastic strain developed under cyclic
loads. The creep-buckling information! is re-
quired for the design analysis of the various core
and reflector shells. These shells will be sub-
jected to pressure differentials and to temperature
gradients both through their thickness and along
their surfaces.

In some instances the materials test information
obtained from the programs mentioned above may
be used directly to estimate the thermal deforma-
tion and buckling characteristics of components
and to determine the life of parts subjected to
cyclic loads. However, this direct application will
be effective only for relatively simple structural
configurations and cannot be used for many of the
important structural members of the reactor. In
the latter cases it will be necessary to resort to
component of scale-model tests under operating
conditions. For example, a test is under way on a
one-fourth-scale model of the outer core shell to
determine whether the core shells will survive the
thermal cycling to which they will be exposed
during the operational life of the reactor. The
operational conditions for this test were based on
the anticipated program of the ART, ond the tem-
peratures and hold-times involved were determined
from relaxation and strain-cycling data on Inconel
(Fig. 24). This test should indicate, also, the
extent to which the strain-cycling and relaxation
data based on simple uniaxial stress conditions
can be extrapolated to the more complex patterns
encountered in the actual design.

The detailed stress analysis of the ART, now
under way, consists in examining the system op-
erating pressures ond thermal and cyclic loads.
The operating pressure loads were used to size
the principal structural members. The criterion

Comparison with ART Thermal-Cycling Conditions.

presently in use requires that the stress level
created by these loads be no more than one-fourth
the value known to cause rupture from creep if
applied for 1500 hr. The stress analysis is based
on elastic theory, but for very complicated con-
figurations the analysis is supported by experi-
mental studies on models of the actual member.
This scheme of analysis has been applied in a
preliminary manner to all structural components of
the reactor, its support structure, the NaK piping
inside and outside the pressure cell, and the heat
dump systems {NaK pumps and radiators). These
preliminary studies have been completed, and
attention is now being focused con the detailed
stress analysis of the major structural members
which are a part of the reactor proper; these mem-
bers include the north-head double-deck composite
structure, the reflector suppert ring, the core and
reflector shells, and the fuel dump tank and
supports.

A tentative set of design criteria has been se-
lected for the detailed examination of the system
from the viewpoint of thermal and cyclic loads.
For members that will be subjected to thermal
loads which may occur only a few times during
their life, the design criterion is that the strains
produced by these loads not exceed 0.2%. Based
on the concept of an elastic stress-strain relation,
this corresponds to a stress of around 30,000 psi
at 1300°F. Such « criterion, although in agreement
with the design philosophy of the ARE, is believed
te be exiremely conservative, and a more realistic
one is being considered and will be evaluated by
the results obtained from the strain-cycling tests
for the lower number of cycles. The criterion for
the design of members subjected to cyclic plastic
strain is also based on the requirement that the
maximum deformation during a cycle not exceed
0.2%. At temperatures of the order of 1300°F a

specimen thus loaded should survive more than

 
 

 

200 cycles. This figure is based on the best
strain-cycling data now available. '¢ This crite
rion will be used until more reliable information is
obtained from the strain-cycling test program under
way at ORNL and at the University of Alabama.
The thermal-stress criteria outlined here are in
use in the analysis of the cyclic heating of the
core and reflector shells, the pressure-shell liner,
and the thermal sleeve attachments for all pipe
outlets from the reactor, as well as in the thermal-
stress analysis of the fuel pumps and of the NaK
manifolding at the reactor. An analysis is alse in
progress for determining the thermal expansions
and distortions of the various shells ond the
beryllium within the reactor. These calculations
require the femperature distributions previously
mentioned, and the results obtained from the work
will determine the final tolerances and clearances
between these members. It should be recognized
that the proper fit of the parts under the operating
conditions will define the cold dimensions to
which the system must be assembled.

The analytical studies described above are sup-
ported in mony areas by parallel programs of ex-
perimental stress anclysis. The bulk of the work
is being carried out at the University of Tennessee
and includes the actual model tests of the north-
head composite-deck structure, the pump barrel
and NaK pipe attachments to the pressure shell,
the main and auxiliary heat exchanger headers, the
reflector support ring, the blowout patch for the
pressure shell, and the NaK piping systems out-
side the reactor cell.

The emphasis in the design analysis under way
and that programed for the near future is placed on
the re-evaluation of the design criteria, the de-
tailed stress analysis of the primary structure, the
completion of strain-cycling tests of component
models, and the study of off-design and transient
operating conditions.

Auxiliary Components

Several major structural components external fo
the reactor, including the reactor support system,
the fuel fill-and-drain tank and support, and the
main NaK piping which carries the heat from the
reactor to the radiators, have also been analyzed.

 

Yenuclear Propulsion Program Engineering Progress
Report No, 18, October 1, 1955-—-December 31, 1955,
PWAC-554.

The reactor is to be suspended from an overhead
bridgelike structure by means of the four pump
barrels (Fig. 25). The attachment of the individual
barrels to the bridge allows horizontal motion of
the barrels so as to accommodate the relative
thermal growth between the reactor {at operating
temperature} and the bridge (at room temperature).
Vertical motion of the barrels is completely re-
strained. The bridge is fixed at each end to «
flexible column consisting of I-in.-thick steel
plates, 28 in. wide and 123 in. long. The load
carried by each column is approximately 45,000 1b.
This value is somewhere between one-fourth and
one-half the value required to cripple the column.

The principal function of the flexible columns
is to allow complete freedom for the Nal lines
to expand in going from room temperature fo the
operating tempercture of the reactor. During full-
power operation the upper row of NeK lines will
be at 1070°F, the lower row at 1500°F. This will
result in a horizontal growth of Y in. in the upper
lines and th in. in the lower lines. [f the reactor
is mounted in the cold condition precisely ever the
center line of the column bases, these expansions
will fronslate and rotate the reactor out of the
position and thereby introduce bending

eliminate the bending stresses, it is planned to
precut the NaK lines so that at room temperature
the reactor will be located 1 in. off the neutral
position toward the cell wall through which the
NaK lines enter. As the reactor heats up, these
lines will expand end move the reactor into the
neutral position, thus removing the bending loads
on the columns.

Although the flexible columns can allow for the
gress expansions of the NaK lines, they cannot
provide for the differential expansion between the
lines of any one row. In order to provide some
margin for operational accidents and freedom in
controlling NaK temperatures, it is plenned to add
several bends into each line to accommodate 300
to 400°F temperature differences between adjacent
lines. The piping layout proposed for the reactor
cell for this purpose is shown in Fig. 27.

The basic design features of the NaK piping out-
side the reactor cell are similar to those inside
the cell. The principal design requirement is that
the pipe supports and end attachments have suf
ficient flexibility for the lines to expand in going
from room temperafure to the operating temperature
without being subjected to excessive thermal

stresses and without producing excessive loads on
the radiators and pump casings. One of the NaK
radiator-pump assemblies in the ART system is
shown in Fig. 28. The individual lines are welded
at the reactor cell wall, and the joints may be
considered as fixed points in the piping circuit.
The radiator ends of the lines are welded to their
respective radiators, and the entire pump-radiator
assembly is suspended by a system of spring
hangers from overhead sc as to allow freedom of

motion in the principal direction of the NaK lines.
This freedom allows for the over-all growth of the
lines, and the various bends in the individual lines
provide increased flexibility to accommodate dif-
ferences in line lengths.

The operation and flow characteristics of the
fuel fill-and-drain tank system are discussed in
Part il. Since this tank is to serve as an eversafe
depository for the fuel, it must survive some
2000 hr of operation at temperature and possibly

several fast dumps. The principal structural re-
quirements are determined by the 40-psi NaK pump-
ing pressure, which will produce creep in the tank
structure. The design criteria, then, are based on
creep-rupture and thermal-shock considerations.

The most sensitive areas of the design are the
joints between the tube header sheets (Fig. 16)
and the inner cylinder. The discontinuity stresses
in these regions are of the order of 6000 psi, but
the stresses are expected to decay rapidly, once
the system comes to temperature, as a result of

the stress-relaxation phenomenon. Since this com-
ponent is of vital importance to the over-all safety
of the experiment, it is planned to test the entire
tank system by using one of the NaK circuits.
This test will determine the adequacy of the de-
sign in withstanding the creep and thermal shock
effects mentioned above.

The support of the dump tank assembly is ac-
complished with the aid of a nitrogen cylinder
located beneath the tank (Fig. 29). Although the
tank is attached rigidly to the reactor pressure
shell through the fuel drain line, the major portion
of the tank weight is not allowed to bear on the
shell. The total weight of the tank, including the
fuel, is approximately 6000 Ib, of which 5000 ib
will be carried by the nitrogen cylinder. This
arrangement introduces some complication in re-
gard to the stability of the support system, but an
analysis has shown that the proposed arrangement
of lever arms, the structural stiffness of the drain
lines, and the weights are well within the stability
limits of the system.

RADIATION HEATING ON THE ART
EQUATORIAL PLANE IN THE VICINITY OF
THE FUEL-TO-NaK HEAT EXCHANGER

The radiation heating to be expected in the ART
was calculated so as to provide a basis for the
design of cooling systems. The results of the
calculations of the radiation heating on the ART
equatorial plane in the outer 3 em of the beryllium
reflector and in the Inconel and the boron-contain-
ing shells on both sides of the fuel-te-NaK heat
exchanger are presented in Figs. 30 and 31. The
total gamma-ray heating in each region is given in
Fig. 30, as well as the heating from the sources
which are the main contributors to the total in each

RADIATION HEATING IN YARIOUS REGIONS
OF THE NORTH HEAD

The radiation heating to be expected in various
regions in the north head of the ART was calcu-
lated in order to supply numbers from which ther-
mal-stress calculations could be made. Because
of the complexity and the time that would be in-
volved in calculating accurately the heating in all
the regions of the north head, it was decided to
make preliminary estimates of the deposition rates.
More accurate values calculated for other regions
of the reactor were used as guides. In all cases
the tendency was to overestimate the heating.

Calculations were made of the heat-deposition
rate in a slab of Inconel! bounded on one side by

 

7 Eor details of these calculations see Chap. 1.2 of
ANP Quar. Prog. Rep. June 10, 1956, ORNL-2106, p 28.

an infinite fuel region containing the sources of
radiction. This heat-generation rate was used in
all regions in the north head which are bounded by
finite fuel volumes.

The heat-deposition rates in a slab of Inconel
bounded on one side by slabs of sodium of various
thicknesses were calculated, and the results were
extrapolated and interpolated to obtain the heat-
generation rates in the Inconel regions of the north
head which are bounded by various thicknesses of
sodium.

Fairly accurate calculations were made of the
heat-deposition rates in the Inconel filler plates
below the island and in the vicinity of the fuel-to-
NaK heat exchanger on the equatorial plane of the
reactor. These results were used as a guide in
estimating the heating in some north-head regions,
and new values were obtained by compensating (by
simple exponential attenuation) for decreased
beryllium thicknesses, penetrations through addi-
tional fuel layers, increased thermal-neutron leak-

age currents into the north head, etc.

BETA. AND GAMMA-RAY ACTIVITY IN THE
FUEL-EXPANSION CHAMBER AND THE
OFF-GAS SYSTEM

The power-source distribution of the activity of
the gases in the space above the fuel in the fuel-
expansion chamber and in the off-gas line has been
determined. The results obtained are to be used
in the calculation of the radiation heating and the
thermal stresses in this region of the reactor.

The radioactive constituents of the gas in this
space will be the gaseous fission products, xenon
and krypton, and their daughter products. There is
also a possibility thet some volatile fission-
product fluorides will be formed in the fuel and
will escape into this area. However, it has been
shown '® that if oll the fission-product fluorides
entered this space they would add very little ac-
tivity to that already caused by the gaseous fis-
sion products and their daughters. Thus their
effect has been neglected. Also, there is some
question as to whether the daughter products of
the fission gases will actually be carried down-
stream by the off-gas system or whether they will
be deposited on the enclosing walls as they are
formed. In order to get a conservative estimate
of the power-source distribution, it was decided to
treat the daughter products of xenon and krypten
as gases (except insofor as their purging from the
fuel into the fuel-expansion chamber is concerned).

The total power and the power density in the gas
space of the fuel-expansion tank as a function of
the volume of the gas and the helium flow rate are
given in Fig. 33. In the calculation of the curves
the very short- and very long-lived nuclides of
xenon and krypton {along with their decay products)
were neglected. Since the fuel circulation time
in the ART will be less than 3 sec, nuclides with
half tives less than this value will decay mostly
in the fuel before it reaches the purging pumps.
Thus very few atoms with half lives of less than
about 3 sec would get into the gas space. Also,
for nuclides with long half lives (greater than
about 100 hr), the number of disintegrations taking

place in the fuel-expansion chamber and off-gas
line would be small, since the dwell time at the
assumed helium flow rates is very short. There-
fore these nuclides may be neglected.

in this study 32 nuclides were considered, 16
being isotopes of xenon and krypton and 16 being
their daughter products. The main contributors to
the power distribution are the daughter products
and not the nuclides of xenon and krypton them-
seives. In all cases the daughter products con-
tribute about 50 to 60% of the total power distribu-
tion. Of the total power, about 90% is due to the
beta-ray decays, with only 10% being due to
gamma-ray decays. Thus in determining the heat-
ing caused by these gases, it is seen that the heat
deposition will occur mainly in a small surface
layer of the materials surrounding the gases in the
fuel-expansion chamber and the off-gas line.

The power density in the off-gas line as a func-
tion of time and gas volume for helium flow rates

of 1000 ond 3000 liters/doy (STP) is given in

 
 

Fig. 34. The time axis can be converted into
lengths along the off-gas line by dividing the
volume flow rate of the helium gas by the cross-
sectional area of the off-gas pipe. Thus Fig. 34
gives the power-source density of 1 cmd of the
gas at any position in the off-gas line.

 

These plots were made by using the well-known
equations of the decay of parent products and the
buildup of their daughters as a function of time.
The initial conditions at the beginning of the off
gas line were taken as the equilibrium conditions
that would prevail in the fuel-expansion tank.

ENGINEERING TEST UNIT
 

ENGINEERING TEST UNIT

A full-scale zero-power engineering test unit
(ETU) is being fabricated that is a prototype of
the ART. Assembly of the ETU will provide a
test of the feasibility and efficiency of the pro-
cedures prior to assembly of the ART. Thus
time-consuming and expensive rework operations
such as those required for the ARE will be
avoided. The first reactor assembly fabricated
may have, for example, a number of doubtful welds
that would not prevent the initiation of nonnuclear
shakedown tests but would have to be reworked
if the assembly were to be used as the high-power
ART. The fabrication experience gained will be
used in assembling the second unit.

A second and even more vital reason for fabri-
cation and operation of the ETU arises from the
complexity of the stresses on the assembly. The
complex geometry, the wide variety of combi-
nations of thermal and pressure stresses, and the
difficulty of predicting the magnitude and direction
of thermal warping and distortion make it essential
to run a comprehensive fest on a nonnuclear
assembly, even though not all the conditions can
be simulated. Experience at the Knolls Atomic
Power Laboratory! has forcefully demonstrated the
importance of such tests when dealing with a
high-performance complex that is to operate under
conditions for which there are little data or ex-
perience. Upon completion of the tests, the ETU
will be completely disassembled and thoroughly
inspected.

Invaluable shakedown and endurance test ex-
perience will be obtained, and the training of the
setup and operating crews during such a test will
expedite assembly and operation of the ART. It
will be possible, also, to obtain heat transfer
information on the radiators and on the NaK-to-fuel
and sodium-to-NaK circuits and to test some of
the instruments to be used on the ART,

The heat for the nonnuclear ETU will be supe
plied by two gas furnaces, which will replace the
radiators in two of the four main NaK circuits.
It was originally intended that the capacity of
each furnace would be 5 Mw, but each furnace
has been reduced to a capacity of 1 Mw because
of procurement and installation difficulties. Along
with the reduction in the heat input, the radiators

Steam Generator Integrity, KAPL-1450 (Nov. 1, 1955).

have been eliminated from the other two man NaK
circuits, Radiators will be included only in the
reflector-moderator {sodium-to-NaK) cooling circuit.
These radiators will permit a determination of
performance characteristics of not only the radi-
ators but also the louvers and the heat-barrier
doors to be used with them. It is particularly
important that the sensitivity of the controls for
these units be determined at low loads. Since
the units will be essentially the same as those
te be used in the main circuits of the ART, the
test of the reflector-moderator cooling circuit will
serve to answer many basic questions regarding
the performance characteristics of the main circuits
on the ART.

Since there will be nc after-heat and ro radio-
active off-gases, the fuel dump tank and the
off-gas system, rather than being prototypes of
those to be used with the ART, have been
simplified to expedite fabrication, construction,
installation, and testing of the ETU. The fuel
enrichment, recovery, and sampling systems are
not to be included in this nonnuclear test assembly.
The ART design will be followed in every respect
in the fabrication and assembly of the ETU reactor.
The final reactor for the ART will differ from the
ETU reactor only in modifications brought about
by the fabrication, installation and operation of
the ART. Only those changes considered to be
absolutely essential to the successful operation
of the ART are expected to be made.

SPECIFIC TEST OBJECTIVES

The most valuable information to be obtained
from the ETU will probably be the disclosure of
unanticipated difficulties, such as interferences
in assembly or installation or difficulties arising
from misoperation of certain elements of the
system under peculiar operating conditions, but
several prime objectives have been established
for the ETU test program. The first and most
important will be a determination of the tendency
of parts to warp, shrink, or otherwise distort during
the original welding and assembly precesses and
during testing, Dimensional checks will be made
on all parts during inspection prior to and during
assembly, and the actual dimensions will be
recorded.

The most important sets of diménsions, from the
standpoint of satisfactory reactor operation, are

75
those that affect the moving parts, particularly the
pump impellers. Distortion might cause infer-
ference between the impeller and the stationary
elements of the pump, which, in turn, might cause
malfunctioning of the pump.

Dimensional data on the cooling annuli for the
core, reflector, and pressure shells will also be
recorded,
held to close tolerances, both in local regions
and for the complete assembly. Some types of
deviation will have little effect, while other types
could have quite serious effects. It is not
possible to state explicitly which ones of the
many possible combinations of deviations from
drawing telerances will be acceptable and which
witl not, but it is important tc determine the
general magnitude and direction of the distortions
in the ETU resulting from assembly operations
and from testing so that the importance of such
distortions in the ART can be reasonably ap-
praised. Unfortunately, the temperature distri-
bution and hence the distortion pattern in the ART
during high-power operation will be different from
those in the ETU, but the distortion during zero-
power operation and during most of the fow- and
medium-power operation of the ART should be
the some as that in the ETU. Further, many
particularly bad off-design and transient conditiens
can be simulated in the ETU, and the effects on
distortion will be studied,

It is important that these annuli be

Flow tests on various components will be carried
out during the assembly of the recctor. These
tests, which may be made with either water or
air, are partly fer checking the calculated pressure
drops through the complex circuits and partly for
calibrating the systems so that they will serve
as flowmeters for work during the high-temperature
testing.

WARMUP AND SHAKEDOWN TESTING

During the initial warmup and shakedown testing
of the ETU a considerable amount of test dota
will be obtained for use in evaluating the design.
Date will be taken on the pressure drops through
important elements of the system and, most es-
pecially, on the over-all pressure drop at each
of a series of given flow rates, and the results
will be checked against the predicted values.
Close attention will be given to the behavior of
the liquid levels in the expansion tanks for the
hot fiuids so that the accuracy and the dependa-
bility of the fiquid-level indicators cen be de-

76

termined. The heat losses to various elements of
the system will also be measured, and the effects
of operation and position of the heat-barrier doors
and louvers in the auxiliary cooling system will
be determined. It is especially important that
the sensitivity of the heat losses near the zero-
power condition be determined as a function of
position of both the heat-barrier decors and the
louvers.

OPERATING TESTS

Operation of the ETU should felicw the program
prepared for the ART insofar as possible; in
particular, the pump speeds and hence the system
pressures should be programed in the same way
as is planned for the ART. Thus the initial
operation will be carried out at low pump speeds,
the NaK pumps being operated at probably one-half
speed ond the fuel and sodium pumps at about

10% speed. After completion of the low- and
intermediate-power simulation in the ETU, the
pump speeds will be increased to full design

operating values. During this simulated operation
it wiil be possible to obtain further test data on
the flow characteristics of the various systems,
the heat balance data, and some indication as
to the performance of the heat exchangers, par-
ticularly those in the reflector-moderator cooling
circuit. The precision with which the heat balance
data can be obtained will be determined by
checking the heat balance date for the air, the
NaK, and the sodium systems against each other.
During the shakedown operations it will probably
be desirable to determine the effect that cutting
out cone or more pumps will have on the liquid
levels in the expansion tanks. Also, it may be
possible to conduct tests on the performance of
the xenon-removal system.

A carefully programed series of thermal-strain.
cycling tests will be included in the ETU oper-
ational tests. Delineation of this program will
be delayed until the siress analysis work is
essentially completed so that significant tests
can be made. Hence the precise temperature
levels, pressure levels, and flow rates that should
be used in this program cannot be specified until

around December 1956.

REACTOR ASSEMBLY

The reactor is made up of five major subas-
semblies: the reflector-moderater, the main heat
exchanger, the north head, the island and south

 

 
 

 

pressure-shell liner assembly, and the pressure
shell. Each of these major sections is to be
assembled and then fitted together in the proper
sequence to produce a complete assembly,

Many of the individual components of the subas-
semblies present difficult fabricational problems
because of their geometric shape and the di-
mensional tolerances specified. A particularly
difficult problem will be encountered in helding
close tolerances on complicated weldments and
on the thin-walled concentric shells which form
the fluid passages and separate the components
of the reactor. The most meticulous and rigorous
inspection techniques availcble are to be used
on materials and welds.

Assembly of the reactor will start with the
reflector-moderator, which is made up of the outer
fnconel core shell, the beryllium hemispheres,
the strut-ring structure, the B,C layer, and the
incone! reflector shells. The upper and lower
halves of the Inconel outer core shell will be
welded together at the equator, and the upper
collar will be welded tc the top of the shell. The
Inconel spacers will be fitted on the inside surface
of the beryllium hemispheres, and the beryllium
will be fitted around the Inconel shell. The
spacers on the outer surface of the beryllium will
then be installed, together with the canned copper-
B,C patches, at the north end, The strut-ring
assembly and the Inconel reflector shell that
houses the beryllium will then be welded together
and to the outer core shell. Next, the B,C tiles
will be positioned on the outer surface of the
assembly and covered with the Y -in.-thick Inconel
shell that serves as the boron jacket. The B,C
tiles are to be placed in sheet metal containers,
one half of which will be spot-welded tc the
surface of the shells and the other half will be
slipped into the attached half to form a container
around the tile. This operation will complete the
reflector-moderator assembly.

Special movable fixtures will be used to place
the 12 tube bundles of the main heat exchanger
around the reflector assembly. The units must
be fitted into place simultaneously and held in
position so that the northshead assembly may be
lowered over the reflector-moderator—heat ex-
changer assembly. The north head is ¢ compli-
cated weldment containing the fuel pump volutes
and housings, the fuel-expansion tank, the core

entrance header, the sodium pump volutes, and
the sodium-to-NaK heat exchangers. The north
head will be built up from subweldments of the
pump volutes and header passages on two decks.
Welding accessibility and welding sequerice te
prevent excessive warpage of critical surfaces are
the most difficult problems envisioned for this
assembly at the present time. Weldability models
that illustrate the steps involved in assembling
the north head are shown in Figs. 35 through 41.

The island and south pressure-shell liner as-
sembly will be assembled by fitting the upper and
lower beryllium sections together and placing the
spacers on the beryllium surface. The upper and
lower sections of the inner core shell will then
be placed around the beryllium, and the equatorial
weld will be made. The upper island and the
expansion joint will be welded to the core shell
to form the island assembly. The south pressure-
shell liner assembly will then be assembled with
the shells containing the neutron shieldirg and
welded to the island assembly. The island will
be inserted through the moderator assembly so
that the bellows assembly will slip into position
in the north head and sc that the southern pressure
shell liner will seat against the northern section
at the equator. The equaterial weld will then be
made,

The upper half of the pressure shell will be
lowered over the reactor assembly, and the lower
pressure shell, with the laminated filter plates
in place, will be brought into position. The girth
weld will be made for joining the two halves of
the pressure shell. The upper island connection
will be welded to the upper pressure shell, and
the heat exchanger header pipes will be welded to
the pressure shell sleeves.

The sodium expansion tank will be welded to
the upper pressure shell, and the confrol rod
sleeve will be welded at the top of the expansion
tank to complete the reactor assembly.

The assembly will include the lead shield in
order to obfain a test of the support structure and
the cooling systems. The water shield will be
omitted on the ETU fc ease procurement and
installation problems. The many shield pene-
trations for instrumentation, helium, off-gas, and
other connections to the reactor and reactor shell
appurtenances make the detailed shield design and
installation very difficult.

REACTOR DISASSEMBLY

Dimensional data will be taken at frequent
intervals throughout the disassembly of the ETU.
The first step after removal of the reactor from
the test stand will be the determination of the key
dimensions of the pressure shell, The over-all
heights from the level of the pump mounting
flanges to the north head and to the south head
will be measured. A cut will then be made at the
equator through both the pressure shell and the
pressure-shell liner. A cut will also be taken
through the thermal sleeves around the heat ex.
changer header outlet tubes at the south end, and
the sleeve that attaches the island assembly to
the north head will be severed. This will permit
the removal of the island and the southern half
of the pressure shell. The core shells, pressure
shell, and the heat exchanger can then be ex-
amined. Dimensional data on the pump wells,
on the pump impellers, and on the areas in the
vicinity of close impeller cleardnces will be

taken. The welds that attach the pressure shell
dome toc the north head around the roots of the
fuel pump barrels will be milled out, ard the
transfer tubes that attach the reflector assembly
to the north head, together with the thermal
sleeves ond heat exchanger outlet tubes at the
north head, will be cut. The twe regions can then
be separated for inspection. The reflector shell
will be cut, and the beryllium will be removed and
inspected for corrosion, spacer fretting, and
thermal cracking.

Other elements of the ETU system, including
the snow traps, the cold traps, the filters in the
NaK system, etc., will also be inspected. Typical
sections of piping will be removed and inspected
for corrosion and mass transfer. The NaK pumps
will be checked for changes in impeller running
clearance, the dump valves will be inspected,
and all elements of the plumbing will be carefully
dye-checked for thermal cracks that might have
been induced during the operation.

CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION

PLANS FOR INSTALLATION OF THE ART

The present plans for assembly and installation
of the ART were evolved to minimize the time re-
quired to get the ART infec operation. It was
recognized that not only must the ART assembly
start before completion of the ETU tests but also
that operation of the ART would have to be de-
layed if operation or disassembly of the ETU
indicated the need for modifications of the reactor
unit. As a result, three complete reactor units are
being ordered. Subassemblies of the third unit
will be started as soon as the second unit is
assembied, but final assembly will not be started.
The second reactor will be assembled and installed
in Building 7503 as rapidly as possible and, if no
trouble develops in the ETU, will be placed in
operation as soon as the disassembly and the
inspection of the ETU have been completed. How
ever, if disassembly of the ETU indicates the
necessity for modifications, work will be started
on the third set of subassemblies as soon as
decisions are reached as to the nature of the modi-
fications required. Final assembly of the third
unit would proceed concurrently with the removal
of the second unit.

OPERATION OF THE ART

Filling and Heating

The initial filling and heating of the reactor are
part of both the testing procedure and the operating
procedure by virtue of the reactor being of the
circulating-fuel type. The NaK system will be
filled with NaK, and, then, with the heat-barrier
doors closed, the NaK pumps will be started. The
power provided by pumping the NaK at one-half
design-point flow will supply most of the heat re-
quired, and electrical heaters will supply the rest
of the heat needed to bring the system up to 1200°F
in ¢ minimum of 24 hr.

The sodium for cooling the reflector-moderator
and the sodium for cooling the control rod will be
added during the heating period when the system
temperature is about 350°F. With the sodium pumps
operating, it will then be permissible to add more
heat to the system through the main NaK system.
With the system isothermal at 1200°F, the cold-
trap systems will be gradually cooled down in
order to remove oxides from the Nak,

The fused-salt fuel carrier will be put into the
fill-and-drain tank when the entire system is in
an isothermal condition at 1200°F., The fuel pump
will be started and will be operated at a nominal
speed of 100 rpm, and the fuel carrier will be
pressurized into the reactor and heat exchanger
system. The dump valves will then be closed,
and the fuel and sodium pump speeds will be in-
creased in order to degas the systems. When the
system has been degassed and the design fuel
has been obtained in the swirl tank, the
main NaK pump speeds will be increased to design
point, Increases in the main NaK pump speeds
will be made stepwise in about six steps from one-
half speed to design-point speed.

level

Isothermal operation with all pumps operating at
design-point speed will be maintained for about
24 hr, With all the pumps operating at design point
the added power will raise the temperature of the
system. The electrical heating will be decreased,
as required, in order to maintain the system in an
isothermal condition. If it is necessary, a main
blower will be started and the heat removal will be
controlled by manipulation of the auxiliary louver
positions so that the system can be maintained in
an isothermal condition with all pump speeds at
the values desired,

After no more than 24 hr of isothermal operation
of the system, the dump valves will be opened and
the fuel carrier will be dumped inte the fill-and-
drain tank. Opening the dump valves will cuto-
matically reduce the main NaK pump speeds fo one-
half design-point speed ond at the same time will
reduce the fuel and sodium pump speeds to estab-
lished minimums.

Samples of the fuel carrier, the NaK, and the
sodium will then be token and examined for corro-
sion products. Mass spectrographic analyses of
these samples will also be made in order to de-
termine whether any leckage occurred between any
two adjacent systems,

If there is no evidence of leakage and if the
corrosion-product analysis indicates that the
carrier is clean, a portion of the carrier will be
withdrawn from the fill-and-drain tank to make room
for the addition, in two steps, of sufficient Na UF
tc provide a fuel mixture which hos about 60% of
the U235 required to achieve criticality with the
regulating red withdrawn. The estimate of 60% is

85
based on the system volume and on the data ac-
quired during the high-temperature critical experi-
ments described in Part Hl of this report.

Enriching te Critical

After addition of the initial charge of Na, UF,
mixing will be accomplished by pressurizing the
fluid into the system until its surface level is
approximately at the mid-point of the reactor; the
pressure will then be released tc callow the fluid
to return to the fill-ond-drain tank. It is estimated
that five or six such cycles will be required to
produce adequate mixing. During this mixing pro-
cedure the control rod will be at a withdrawn posi-
tion of about one-fifth its full stroke.

The fuel mixture will be pressurized to fill the
reactor system to the operating fluid level. This
operation must proceed slowly as it nears com-
pletion, In order to avoid overfitling the reactor, a
level indicator will be provided in the fuel overflow
line, in addition to the level indicator in the fuel-
expansion tank. The pressure in the dump tank
will be limited by a pressure-relief regulator to a
value that will be just sufficient to force the fuel
up to the minimum level. This pressure will have
been estimated from the fluid shakedown tests,

If proper mixing has been accomplished, addition
of the initial charge is not expected to bring the
reactor to criticality, since the fuel addition was
calculated to give a reactivity value (k) of about
0.94. Improper mixing could, however, produce
some abnormal effects, since the fuel pumps will
be operating at the established minimum speed.
The slowly circulating fuel could pass through
the core in an alternately rich and lean stream,
and the count rate of the fission chambers would
follow these patterns of fuel density. Since design-
point circulation occurs only when the fluid level
is high enough for the pumps tc do some pumping,
pauses in the mixing cycle cannot be expected to
improve the mixing.

During the pressurizing of the initial charge of
fuel into the reactor, safety instrumentation will
be set on either a fast period or an estcblished
maximum neutron flux level to dump the fuel by
automatically releasing the pressure on the fill-
and-drain tank, since the fuel drain valves will
not have been closed. The operation will not be
carried out with full reliance on these safety
devices. As is customary for a new reactor, much
of the operation at this stage will depend upon the
skill of the frained and experienced operator,

Fast regulfating-rod insertion at the calculated
rate of change in Ak/k of -%% per second and
concurrent release of the helium pressure over the
filloand-drain tank will provide the means for re-
versing a fast rate of rise of the neutron flux,
These operations, in addition to being automatically
actuated, can be manually set in motion by one
manual switch on the console in the control recom.

It is believed that poor mixing would cause the
filling of the reactor, after the addition of the initial
charge of enrichment mixture, to be the most haz-
ardous step in the enrichment procedure. Exo
perience with the high-temperature critical assembly
indicated, however, that adequate mixing can be
achieved. Successive charges of enrichment
material will be so small that no one charge could
bring the reactor to criticality unintentionally, even
with the poorest of mixing. The charges of enriched
material made after the initial one will be in quan-
tities that will increase the reactivity by an average
amount of about 0.3% for a given rod setting.

After the initial enrichment charge has been
properly mixed with the carrier and the mixture has
been pressurized into the fuel system of the re-
actor, count rates will be taken for a minimum of
five positions of the regulating rod. These posi-
tions can be determined accurately ond will be
recorded.

The fuel will then be dumped into the fiil-and-
drain tank, and another accurately measured en-
richment charge will be added. The mixing opera-
tions will be repeated. The fuel will again be
pressurized into the system, and count rates will
again be token for the same positions of the regu-
tating rod and will be recorded. This procedure
will be repeated for all successive additions of
enriched material. Curves showing the reciprocal
of the count rate as a function of the mass of U235
in the system will be plotted for each of the five
rod positions after each addition is completed.

At some stage in the enrichment procedure, be-
fore the reactor is critical with the rod withdrawn,
the fuel dump valves will be cicsed to permit an
increase in fuel and sodium pump speeds. These
pump speeds will be brought to design point, and
the heat removed in the auxiliary system will be
adjusted to maintain the system in an isothermal

condition.

have been increased.
With fuel and sodium pumps operating at their
respective design-peint speeds and with the main

 

 
 

 

NaK pumps operating ot one-half design-point
speed, a temperature differential will be imposed
on the system by opening the heat-barrier doors,
starting a blower, if necessary, and opening the
main louvers a small amount, The exact conditions
to be used will have been determined in the earlier
fluid shakedown tests. This operation will be
carried out with the regulating rod inserted fo
about one-fifth its full travel.

The mean fuel temperature will be continuously
recorded, and the count rate will be recorded. The
relation between the count rate and the mean fuel
temperature should give semiquantitative evalua-
tion of the fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity,
It will be necessary to cool the NaK system slowly
and to have completed enough of the enriching to
get a sufficiently high count rate te obtain reliable
statistics.

After these date have been obtained, the heat
removal will be stopped; that is, the blower will be
shut off, the louvers will be closed, and the heat-
barrier doors will be closed, The system will be
returned to the previous isothermal condition at ¢
temperature of 1200°F by the operating heaters and
the pumps as described previously. The fuel and
sodium pump speeds will then be reduced to the
established minimums, and the fuel will be dumped
into the fill-ond-drain tank.

Successive additions of No, UF, wiil be made
until the reactor is critical with the regulating rod
fully withdrawn and then until the reactor is critical
with the rod 80% withdrawn. Inhour curves will
be obtained from data taken at each rod position at
which the system is critical, in the usual way.
The data will be obtained with the fuel pumps
operating at the established minimum speed. Under
these conditions the reactor may be considered as
a stationary-fuel reactor for the purpose of fixing
the fission-fragment delayed-neutron yield.

The delayed-neutron contribution to reactivity as
a function of fuel pump speeds can best be deter-
mined in the low-power-level experiments by
holding the reactor critical and at a constant flux
for all pump speeds. This will be done by the flux
servo system, which will hold the flux constant
by withdrawing or inserting the regulating rod upon
an increase or a decrease of the pump speeds. By
the time that this experiment is conducted the regu-
lating rod will have been calibrated for the sta-
tionary-fuel case, or, if not, the data will be in-
terpreted after the rod has been calibrated.

Low-Power-l.evel Experiments

Low-power-level experiments will be completed
before all the enriching has been done, that is,
when sufficient enriching has been done to bring
the reactor critical with the regulating rod 80%
withdrawn,

The reactor will be brought critical when the
system is isothermal ot 1200°F, The dump valves
will be closed, and the neutron flux will be set at
a nominal volue estimated to represent a nuclear
power of 10 w. Control of the rod will be placed
on the flux servo, with the fuel and sodium pumps
operating at their established minimum speeds.
Both the fuel and the sodium pump speeds will
then be gradually brought up to design point, The
position of the regulating rod will be continuously
recorded, as will the pump speeds. The servo
system will withdraw the regulating rod tc main-
tain constant flux.

The speeds of both the fuel and the sodium
pumps will be decreased slowly to their established
minimums while the servo holds the flux constant.
This operation will be carried cut carefully and
probably ot a slower rate of decrease in pump
speed then was possible for the rate of increase,
since, at some point, the rote of decrease in pump
speed will be such that the servo cannot keep the
flux from rising. Abruptly stopping o fuel pump
will automatically initiate a fast regulating-rod
insertion at a rate of change in Ak/k of — 4% pet
second. These experiments should provide the
data required for evaluating the delayed-aeutron
coniribution to reactivity as a function of the fuel
pump speed.

With the regulating rod controlled by the servo,
the flux will be held constant and the sodium and
fuel pumps will again be brought up to design-point
speeds. The system will be made isothermal at
1200°F and then cooled, at a rate previously de-
termined in the fluid shakedown tests, by opening
the main barrier doors and the main louvers, as
necessary.

The mean fuel and sedium temperatures and the
rod position will be continuously recorded. The
cooling of the system should cause the rod to be
inserted and permit a quantitative evaluation of
the negative temperature coefficient, Part of the
temperature coefficient will be derived by cooling
the fuel and part by cooling the moderator. Careful
analysis of the rod position, and, accordingly, the
Ak/k, vs the fuel mean temperature will, however,
give a reliable estimate of the fuel temperature

87
coefficient of reactivity. This estimate will be
used in conjunction with the determination of the
over-all system temperature coefficient and the
sodium temperature to estimate the moderator tem-
perature coefficient of reactivity. If the rod cali-
bration at this stage is thought to be inadequate,
the data from this experiment can be saved until
the rod calibration has been completed, and then
these coefficients can be estimated in terms of
(Ak/k}/°F.

After completion of these experiments the system
will be brought isothermal at 1200°F at the con-
stant flux with the regulating rod on servo control.
Then the regulating rod will be inserted manually,
the fuel and secdium pump speeds reduced fo their
established minimums, and the fuel dumped into
the fill-and-drain tank.

The enrichment process will then be resumed,
with the same procedure being used as that de-
scribed above, until the reactor is critical with
approximately 20% of the regulating red withdrawn,
Spot checks of the delayed-neutron coniribution to
the reactivity as a function of the fuel pump speeds
may be made before complete enrichment has been
effected. Likewise, spot checks of the tempera-
ture coefficient of reactivity may be made before
enrichment has been completed.

Operation at Power

A final low-power-level check of the temperature
coefficient of reactivity will be made before opera-
tion at power is undertaken. This check will be
made by the procedure described above.

The reactor will then be taken to power in the
same sequence as that used for the ARE. With
the system isothermal at 1200°F and critical, the
regulating rod will be withdrawn unti| the reactor
is on a positive period of about 20 sec. For a
while the log N recorder should trace a straight
line, The line will be straight as long as the
positive period is constant. As soon as the nuclear
power is high enough to heat the fuel appreciably,
the period will increase because of the negative
fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity. Like-
wise, the siope of the log N curve will decrease.
At the time that the period storts increasing, the
main and auxiliary barrier doors will be opened.
Opening these barrier doors will put some load on
the reactor. The log N curve should then level off,
either at a higher or lower fevel than that existing
when the barrier doors started to open or at the

88

same level, Since the barrier doors can be main-
tained entirely opened or entirely closed, there
will be no means for perturbing the load at this
stage of the operation. In fact, it will be advisable
not to attempt to keep the power at this level too
tong, since there will be no means for adequately
controlling the various temperatures. The moderator
may overcool or overheat,

With the louvers closed, a main blower will be
started. This will cause a flow of air across the
radiators ond will increase the power extracted
from the reactor. Without cny regulating rod adjust-
ment, the log N should increase and level off at a
new level. At the new level, as a result of the
negative fuel temperature coefficient, the system
stability shouid be comparable to that of the ARE
with the heat-barrier doors open. For the ARE the
foad was about 200 kw. For the ART, comparable
stability should exist at about 1.2 Mw. The
product of the fuel heat capacity in the reactor
and the fuel temperature coefficient for the ART
should be approximately six times the corresponding
product for the ARE, These factors determine the
power level at which comparable stabilities may
be expected. At 1.2 Mw the reactor power should
level out promptly without excessive ‘‘ringing’’
on small perturbations in load or rod position.

it will be advisable to open the main louvers
gradually until the nuclear power is from 6 to 10 Mw.
Perturbations in load and in rod position can be
made at this power range, and the sodium tempera
ture control can be maintained. A power run ex-
tending for several days can be made then with a
mean fuel temperature of 1200°F and o maximum
power output of just over 23 Mw. After this run
the reactor will be shut down by slowly closing
the main NaK louvers and, finally, by inserting the
regulating rod.

The fuel will then be dumped into the fill-and-
drain tank, and a sample will be pressurized into
one of the sample cells and sealed off with a
bismuth freeze valve. The fuel will again be pres-
surized into the system, and the reactor will be
taken critical while isothermal ot 1200°F, To
maintain the system isothermal will require a
greater air load than was needed for the clean
system because of the afterheat from fission
fragments.

With the regulating rod on servo the fuel and
sodium pumps will be slowly brought to design
point, and xenon purging will be allowed to proceed
until the rod position has become constant for

 
 

 

several minutes, Then the helium bleed into the
purging system will be decreased for several
minutes to determine its influence on the xenon
purging. A decrease in purging should cause the
regulating rod to withdraw slowly, This stage in
the experiment will be the most favorable for xenon-
purging tests, since the system will be free from
temperature coefficient compensations on perturba-
tions in xenon removal and since the iodine
precursor of xenon can be evaluated accurately as
a function of time. The only xenon removal which
can occur at large rates is that provided by the
purging system.

After experiments to determine the character-
istics of the xenon-purging system have been com-
pleted, the reactor will be taken to its maximum
power with a 1200°F mean fuel temperature {approx-
imately 23 Mw). The regulating rod will then be
withdrawn until the mean fuel temperature in the
reactor is 1250°F. The louvers will be opened
until the NaK temperatures at the radiator outlets
are 1070°F. This will give the maximum power
load available with a mean fuel temperature of
1250°F. This power level will be maintained for
several days and then lowered by inserting the
regulating rod until the mean fuel temperature is
1200°F., Then the shutters will be closed, the
fuel will be dumped, and another sample will be
taken.

Procedures for operating the reactor at mean fuel
temperatures of 1300, 1350, and 1400°F will be
precisely the same as those described for operation
at 1250°F., Each power run will continue for
several days, with the condition imposed that the
duration of all power runs at or above 20 Mw shell
not exceed 1000 hr. After each power run the fuel
will be dumped and a sample will be taken. At
the end of the last power run the fuel will be
dumped and will be cooled in the fill-and-drain
tank until the cfterheat has decreased to such an
extent that the fuel can be pressurized into the
recovery tank.

PLANS FOR DISASSEMBLY

It has been recognized from the inception of the
ART project that the disassembly of the reactor
would be a very difficult operation. It is, of
course, extremely important that a fairly complete
disassembly and ‘post-mortem’ be conducted on
the reactor to determine how well it withstood the

test conditions. Information will be desired on

corrosion, deposits, plating-out of fission products,
structural stability, distortion, warping, cracking
and loca! behavior in the vicinity of welds, brazed
joints, efc., compatibility of beryllium and Inconel,
integrity of the boron-carbide layer and its cladding,
and radiation damage effects on the various ma-
terials, particularly those associated with the
boron-carbide layer, etc.

Enough information is now available to present a
fairly comprehensive picture of the disassembly
problem. It seems best that a rough disassembly
be carried out in a hot cell designed for the purpose,
The heavy disassembly operations can be carried
out in this cell, and the small somples can be
removed in lead pigs and examined in smaller
specialized hot cells well removed from the very
large amounts of activity associated with the main
reactor assembly.

The first step in the analysis of the disassembly
problem has been the determination of source
strengths for the varicus activities. Basically,
there will be, of course, the activity of droplets
of fuel that will adhere to the surfaces of the fuel
circuit, Similarly, there will be some activity from
sodium droplets that will adhere to surfaces of
the sodium circuit. The Inconel will become
activated, primarily the cobalt constituent, as will
the beryllium, both because of the presence of
cobalt impurities and scandium impurities. In
addition, radioactive elements will be plated-out
from the fuel, nomely, ruthenium, columbium, and
Further, it can be expected thot
fission-fragment activity will be buried in the
Inconel core shells. While both the adhering and
the plated activity might be removed by a drastic
cleaning operation, such as an acid etch, such a
cleaning operation is obviously undesirable be-
cause it would destroy the valuable evidence
wanted for corrosion analyses. While it is difficult
to estimate the amount of liquid that will adhere
to wetted surfaces, it appears that roughly 2% of
the liquid in both the fuel and the sodium circuits
will remain in the reactor after it is drained. A
flushing operation carried out with a non-uraniume
bearing fluoride mixture will remove probably 90%
of this residual activity, However, such a flushing
operation will not remove plated-cut activity or the
activity of the fission fragments buried in the core
shells. The principal advantages of the flushing
operation would be « reduction in air-borne con-
tamination during disassembly, a probable reduction
in the activity of parts wetted by fuel in the lower

molybdenum.

89
temperature portions of the system, a marked re-
duction in activity held up in the thermal sleeves
at the south end, and a very marked reduction in
activity in the drain valves and the drain line.
The problems that would be posed by the activity
in the drain fine and valves during the removal of
the reactor from the cell might alone justify a
flushing operation. Unfortunately, this operation
would have to be carried out after the fuel had
been transferred from the fill-and«drain tank to the
fuel recovery tank.

Estimotes of the activities associated with the
various parts have been made for 100 ond 300 days
after shutdown and are tabulated in Table 10. The
majority of the data are from decay curves prepared
by Bertini.! From the table it may be seen that
the principal sources of activity are the fission
products in the fuel, the plated-out activity (princi-
pally ruthenium), the cobalt in the Inconel core

shells, and the scandium and cobalt in the beryl.
lium. Each one appears to give a source of the
order of 1,000 to 100,000 curies 100 days after
shutdown. All the other activities seem to be of
the order of 10 curies or less; therefore if plating-
out were not a problem, it should be possible to
remove small specimens from the reactor and for
each specimen fo have an activity of less than
1 curie. It is evident that, except for the fuel
{which decays by a factor of 10 in the period from
100 to 300 days after shutdown) and the plated-out
ruthenium, the activities are long lived and that
very little advantage would be gained from waiting
the 300 days, except for parts on which plated-out
activity should be expected. While little informa-
tion is available, it appears that the bulk of the
plated-out activity witl be fairly well distributed
over the core shells, the heat exchanger, and
other surfaces of the system wetted by the fuel.

The only isotopes of the plated-cut elements that
need fo be considered at times long after shutdown
(greater than 100 days) are Nb%5, Ru193, and

Ru'96, All the other isotopes have sufficiently
short half lives that they will have decayed
appreciably in 100 days and thus may be neglected.
The only daughter products that will have large
activities at shutdown times greater than 100 days
will be Rh'%37 and Rh1%¢ (daughters of Ru'93
and Ru'?¢, respectively).

The activities, in curies, at shutdown and at 100
and 300 days cofter shutdown for reactor operating
times of 500 and 1000 hr ot 60 Mw are given in
Table 11. Alsc given are the average beta-ray
energy and the average gommasray energy per dis-
integration. It has been assumed that, at shutdown,
the fuel will be dumped, and soc no more plating-cut
in the reactor will take place. While the total
plated-out activity is high when expressed in
curies, the bulk of it, as can be seen in Table 11,
is in relatively soft- gamma rays and the con-
tribution to the radiation dose outside the pressure
shell is really essentially that from the Nb%5 (or
less than 10% of the total activity in curies) and
even that gives only a 0.75-Mev gamma ray, which
is aftenuated 2.5 times as rapidly as the hard
fission=product decay gamma rays.

In extrapolating experience that was gained in
the disassembly of the ARE, the differences in
proposed power level and operating time for the
ART were taken into account. The ARE was
operated for a total of 100 Mwhr, whereas the ART
is scheduled to operate for a total of 30,000 Mwhr.
This difference will mean vastly increased dif-
ficulty in disassembly. Since the bulk of the
activity 100 days or more after shutdown will be

from long-lived isotopes, the activity will be
directly proportional to the number of megawatt-
houts that the reactor is operated.

The information in Table 12 was prepared on the
basis of that in Table 10 to show the effective
source strength of the reactor at various stages of
disassembly, It is evident from Table 12 that work
can be carried out immediately adjacent to the
exterior surface of the water shield 100 days after
shutdown without the need for auxiliary shielding.
Some work can still be carried out immediately
adjacent to the reactor after removal of the water
shield, but this work will have to be limited to a
matter of 10 min or so. After removal of the lead
shield, all work wiil have to be done remotely. A
possible exception might be removal of the lead
shield from the hot cell, The thickness of the
lead shield required for this operation would be of
the order of 3 in. It is not yet clear whether the
space available in the hot cell will make removal
of this lead shield essential,

The limits on the source activity for various
types of hot laboratory work ore indicated in
Table 13. Standard laboratory tolerance dose
rates for operating persennel were presumed in
preparation of this table. As a first step in es-
tablishing sofe working conditions, an attempt will
be made to get a good separation distance between
the operator and the source so that it will be
possible to work with soutces which are on the
order of 0.1 curie. The next step will be the use
of a shadow shield barrier fo cut out line-of-sight
radiation and to employ mirrors for viewing hendling

If these steps are token, a source

be acceptable without shielding can be tolerated.
Finally, it is possible to use a completely en-
closed, heavily shielded hot cell, If this is to be
done, it appears that work on the ART would require
a hotecell wall thickness of 48 in. of special con-
crete of zinc bromide having a density of 3 ¢/cm3,
or the equivalent of 10 in. of lead,
[t is important that all the information provided in
Tables 12 and 13 be considered to be tentative,
The activities are based on the premises indicated,
the most important being that 98% of the fuel will
drain. This analysis was prepared in order to give
a fair over-all picture of the activities with which
it will be necessary to work.
Listed below are the major steps that will be
involved in removing the reactor from the reactor
cell and moving it to the hot cell, as well as dis-
assembly operations that can be carried out in the
het cell prior to closing the top if it is essential
to remove the lead shield from the hot cell:
1. disconnecting instrument, gas, ete.
lines to reactor and shield,

2. removing pump drive motors and adaptors,

3. removing control-rod drive assembly (but not
rod),

4. cutting NaK pipes just outside the water shield,

5. removing all but two of the capscrews that
retain each fuel and sodium pump body in its
pump barrel,

6. removing most of the bolts that attach the
reactor and shield support bridge to columns,

7. drcining and removing lower portion of water
shield,

8. cutting fuel drain lines above valves,

9. draining and removing balance of water shield,

10. attaching reactor support bridge to crane,

11. removing last bolts attaching reactor support
bridge to columns,

12. moving reactor and lead shield assembly to
hot cell and attaching to disassembly fixture,

13. cutting off NaK manifolds just above lead
shield and removing from cell,

14. removing Na pump bodies and removing from

operations.

water,

cell,

15. removing fue! pump bodies and removing from
cell,

16. removing top, bottom, and side sections of
lead shield,

17. removing Zr F (~vapor trap.

It is evident that care should be token in the
detailed design of the attachment of the reactor
support bridge to the columns te facilitate the
removal of the final attachments prior to lifting out
the reactor shield assembly. It is also important
that the water shield be designed to permit rapid
disassembly by the mechanics who must enter the
cell to remove capscrews, etc, Similarly, it is
important that the lead shield be designed so that
it can be disassembled readily, with remote han-
dling equipment, in the hot cell. This will probably
require special design features.

Throughout the discssembly of the reactor
pressure-shell assembly, dimensional data must
be taken at frequent intervals. For example, the
first step after removal of the shield will be the
determination of the key dimensions of the pressure
shell. The over-all height will be measured from
the level of the pump mounting flanges to koth the
north and south heads. A cut can then be rade at
the equator through both the pressure shell and the
pressure-shell liner. A cut will also be taken
through the thermal sleeves around the heat ex-
changer outlet tubes at the south end, and the
sleeve that attaches the island assembly to the
north head will be severed. This will permit the
removal of the island assembly and the southern
half of the pressure shell. The core shells,
pressure shell, and heat exchanger can then be
examined, The most important of the dimensional
data will show the tendency of parts to warp,
shrink, ot otherwise distort during the original
welding and assembly process and during testing.
For example, distortion might cause an interference
between the impellers and the stationary elements
of the pump, which, in turn, might cause male
functioning of the pump. Since changes in the
thickness of cooling annuli might fead to poor
flow distribution and hot spots, dimensional data
on the cocling annuli for the core, reflector, and
pressure shells should also be recorded. This
will require measurement of the diameters of the
beryllium hemispheres and the various shells, and,
of course, it is presumed that a comparison with
dimensional checks will be made during inspection
prior to and during assembly.

The welds that attach the pressure-sheil dome
to the north head around the roots of the fuel pump
barrels can be milled out, and cuts can be made
through the transfer tubes that attach the reflector
assembly to the north head, as well as through the

thermal sleeves and heat exchanger outlet tubes
at the north head. The two regions can then be
separated for inspection, The reflector shell can
be cut out and the beryllium can be removed so
that both can be inspected for corrosion, spacer
fretting, ond thermal cracking. After visual and
dimensional inspection, representative sections
of key elements of the various assemblies can be
cut out, placed in lead pigs, and removed to smaller
hot cells for metallurgical examination, chemical
analysis of deposits, etc. Many areas sheuld be
carefully dye-checked for thermal cracks that
might have been induced during the operation.
When plated-out activity is evident, the relatively
short half life of the activity may make it desirable
to defer work on that part and to work on other less
vital but much less active parts having leng half
lives.

The equipment in the hot cell must include strong
manipulators for handling segments of the reactor
assembly, heavy cutting equipment for sectioning
the reactor into major subassemblies, and equip-
ment for cutting various samples from the sub-
assemblies. An Inconel cutting torch might be
useful for some of this work. However, the cutting
torch should not be used where there is a large
amount of activity, because dispersal of the
activity into the atmosphere of the hot cell would
make decontamination of the cell after completion
of the disassembly operations exceedingly diffi
cult and would greatly aggravate the problem of
loading samples inte lead pigs for removal from
the cell. In general, it seems that no torch cut
should be made where the material in the cut would
have a total activity in excess of 0.001 curie,
while the total amount of activity in all cuts con-
templated with the Inconel torch should not exceed
0.01 curie. Cuts witha milling cutter or an abrasive
saw should be made in such a way that the ma-
terial removed by the wheel or cutter will either
be washed info a sump with a stream of liquid
coolant or will be drawn inte a suitable dust
collector by a vacuumecleaner type of system.

The air-borne contamination con probably be
reduced markedly by the use of saw and milling-
cutter type of equipment, which remove relatively
coarse chips, rather than cutting torches or high-
speed grinding or abrasive types of cutting-wheel
equipment, which yield a fine dust.- This means
that it may well prove worth while to adopt, as a
basic premise, the requirement that all cutting
operations be made with relotively low-speed saws

94

or milling cutters in zones in which the specific
activity is fairly high. An important zone from
this standpoint is the region around the pump
barrels in the north head. [ft must be expected that
the specific activity of the material in the north
head will be about ten times as great as that of
material close to the equator, Hence much of the
total activity anticipated in chips formed during
the separation of the major subassemblies will be
in those formed during disassembly of the north
head.

Another measure that might be taken to reduce
airborne contamination would be to fili the reactor
with a thin solution of strippable varnish. Before
removal of the reactor from the test cell, the varnish
could be drained and the reactor fluid circuits
could be dried with air that could be discharged
through the regular off-gas system. Such a step
may be essential to reduce the air-borne contami.
nation to acceptable limits for the period between
the severing of the line to the dump tank and the
closing of the hot cell,

It is quite evident that space inside the hot cell
will be at a premium, because the various sub-
assemblies of the reactor will take up much more
space than the assembly. [nn this connection it
should be noted that the greatest activity will be
in the beryllium, the core shells, and the various
parts that will be wetted by the fuel. If these parts
can be separated from the others and placed under
a portion of the lead shield, the activity of the
unshielded items in the cell will be much lower,
and it will be much easier to open the cell for
insertion or removal of lead pigs for sample re-
moval.

tt is evident that a few quite special handling
fixtures will be required in order to position the
reactor and the various major components during
the disassembly operction. It will probably be
necessary, before cutting into the surfaces that
have been wetted by fuel, to close the hot cell,
since the air-borne activity from the reactor is
likely to be substantial. Similarly, it may be
desirable te coat the inside of the reactor dis-
assembly cell with a plastic sheet te facilitate
decontamination after the disassembly operations.
A similar strippable coating on the major items of
equipment in the hot cell might also prove to be
advantageous.

It will be necessary to install a zinc bromide
window to permit observation of the disassembly
operations. It would seem desirable fo design the

 

 
 

 

cell so that the mojor items of equipment used in
the disassembly operation can be removed for
servicing. Possibly these large items may be
differentiated into two groups. The first group
would include all parts that will actually come in
contact with the reactor surfaces which have
large amounts of activity, and the other group
would include the balance of the mechanisms. The
first group might be considered to be expendable
and thus might be left in the cell. The remaining
equipment, which should include the heavy and
expensive mechanisms, might be designed so that
it could be removed fairly readily from the ceil

and serviced outside. This will be possible if the
air-borne contamination can be kept to a total of
about 0.1 curie during the course of the disassembly
operation.

it is evident that once the hot cell is equipped it
could serve as a general-purpose hot cell for rough
disassembly work on such items as in-pile loops,
and therefore it might be worth while to make this
hot cell as well suited to other types of work as
can conveniently be done. This would imply that
manipulator ond cutting equipment might be de-
signed for more general-purpose operations than
necessarily required by the ART disassembly.

STATUS OF DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT

The following outline of the key design problems of the circulating-fuel reflector-
moderated reactor and of the present status of the problems serves as a summary of the
work that has been done and of the work that remains to be done to provide a sound basis
for the design of a full-scale aircraft power plant,
