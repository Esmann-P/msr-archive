FREFACE

In September, 1955, a group of men experienced in various scientific
end engineering fields embarked on the twelve months of study which culminated
in this report. For nine of those months, formal clessroom and student
laboratory work occupled their time. At the end of that period, these nine
students were presented with a problem in reactor design. They studied it for
ten weeks, the final period of the school term.

This is a summary report of their effort. It must be realized that
in so short a time, a study of this scope can not be guaranteed complete or
free of error. This "thesis" 1s not offered as a polished engineering report,
but rather as a record of the work done by the group under the lesdership of

‘the group leader. It is issued for use by those persons competent to assess

the uncertainties inherent in the results obtained in terms of the preciseness
of the technicel date and analytical methods employed in the study. In the
opinion of the students and faculty of ORSORT, the problem has served the
pedagogical purpose for which it was intended.

The faculty Joins the suthors in an expression of appreciation for
the generous assistance which various members of the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory gave. In particular, the guidance of the group consultants,

A. M. Weinberg, R. A. Charpie, and H. G. McPherson, is gratefully acknowledged.

ABSTRACT

An externally cooled, fused salt, fast breeder reactor producing 700 MH
of heat has been designed utilizing plutonium as the fuel in a mixture of
the chlorides of sodium, magnesium, uranium and plutonium. Depleted uranium
is used as the fertile material in a blanket of uranium oxide in sodium.

Nuclear calculations have been performed with the aid of the UNIVAC for
multi-group, multi-region problems to obtain an optimum nuclear design of
the system with the chosen fused salt.

Steam temperature and pressure conditions at the turbine throttle have
been maintained such that the incorporation of & conventional turbine-generator
set into the system design is possible.

An economic analysis of the system, including estimated chemical fro-
cessing costs has been prepared. The analysis indicates that the fused salt
system of this study has an excellent potential for meeting the challenge of
economic nuclear power.

It was not learned until the completion of the study of the severe (n,p)
cross section of the chlorine-35 isotope in the range of energies of in-
terest. This effect was amplified by the large number of chlorine atoms pre-
sent per atom of plutonium, The result was considered serious enough to
legislate against the reactor.

It was determined, however, that the chlorine-37 isotope had a high
enough threshold for the (m,p) reaction so that it could be tolerated in
this reactor. The requirement for the chlorine-37 isotope necessitates an
isotope separation which is estimated to add 0.5 mils per kwhr. to the cost
of power. The power cost would then be 7.0 mils per kwhr. instead of the

6.5 mils per kwhr. reported.

 
 

CHAPTER I INTRODUCTION

1.1 PROBLEM
1.1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this study was to assess the technical and econontc
feasibility of a fast breeder-power reactor, employing a fused salt fuel,
based on a reasonable estimate of the progress of the fused salt technology.
Fuel bearing fused salts are presently receiving consideration for high
temperature applications and in eddition have been proposed as a possible

solution to some of the difficult problems of the fast reactor.

1.1.2 Scope

A major consideration was an initial decision to devote the group
effort to a conceptual design of complete reactor system instead of con-
centrating on parameter studies of the reactor or the heat transfer and power
plant at the expense of the other components. This philosophy necessitated
overlooking many small problems that would arise in the detalled design of
the reactor and power plant but provided a perspective for evaluating the
technical and economic feasibility of the entire reactor system instead of
only portions of it.

At the outset of the study it was determined that a breeding ratio
significantly less than one would be obtained from an internally cooled machine.
It was therefore decided to further restrict the study to an externally cooled,
circulating fuel reactor in which a breeding ratio of at least one was ob-

tainable.

1,2 EVALUATION OF FUSED SALTS
| 1.2.1 Advantages of Fused Salts

The fused salts enjoy practically all the advantages of the liquid

| : fueled, homogeneous type reactor. Among the more prominent of these are:

Loa
1. The large negative temperature coefficient which aids in
reactivity control; |
. 2. The elimination of expensive and difficult to perform fuel
element fabrication procedures;
} i 3. The simplified charging procedure which provides a means of
. shim control by concentration charges;
. 4. The higher permissible fuel burn-up without the attendant
, mechanical difficulties experienced with solid fuel elements.
In addition, the fused salts display a superiority over the aqueous
s homogeneous reactor in these respects:
1. Lower operating pressure due to the much lower vapor pressure
of the fused salts;
2. Higher thermodynamic efficiency due to the operation at
| higher temperature.
1.2.2 Disadvantages of Fused Salts
¥ .
. There ere several disadvantages which are attendant upon the use
* of fused salts for the application reported upon here. Of these, the most
“ prejudicial to the success of the reactor are:

1. The corrosion problem which is so severe that progress in
this application awaits development of suitable resistant

materiels;

 
 

2. The lerge fuel inventory required because of the external
fuel hold-up; |

3. The poor heat transfer properties exhibited by the fused
salts;

4, The low specific powers obtainsble in the fused salt fast

reactor system compared to the aqueous homogeneous reactors.

1.3 RESULTS OF STUDY
| The final design is a two region reactor with a fused salt core and a

uranium oxide powder in sodium blanket. The fuel component is plutonium
with & totel system maes of 1810 kg. The reactor has a total breeding ratio
of 1.09 exclusive of chemical processing losses.

The reactor produces TOO MW of heat end has a net electrical output of
260 MA. The net thermal efficiency of the system is 37.1 per cent. The steam
conditions at the turbine throttle are 1000°F end 2400 psi.

The cost of electrical power from this system was calculated to be 6.5
mils per kwhr. This cost included & chemical processing cost of 0.9 mils
per kvhr. based on a core processing cycle of five years and & blanket pro-

cessing cycle of one year.

1. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM

The fused salt fast reactor which evolved from this study is an externally
cooled, plutonium fueled, power<treeder reactor producing 700 megawatts of
heat with & net electrical output of 260 megawatts.

1.4.1 Core

The core fuel consists of a homogeneous mixture of the chlorides

of sodium, magnesium, uranium and plutonium with mole ratios of 3NaCL, MgCl,
and 0.9Pu(U)C1,. The uranium in the core fuel is depleted and is present for
the purposes of internal breeding. The atom ratio of 3 8 pu 5 at startup
is 2 to 1.

The core container is a 72.5 inch I. D., nearly spherical vessel tapered
at the top and bottom to 24 inches for pipe connections. The core vessel
is fabricated of a 4 inch thick corrosion resistant nickel-molybdemm alloy.

The fuel mixture enters the core at 1050°F and leaves at 1350°F, where-
upon it is circulated by means of a constant speed, 3250 horsepower, canned
rotor pump through the external loop and tube side of a sodium heat exchanger.
Sodiwn enters this core heat exchanger at 900°F at & flow rate of 45.5 x 10%
1bs/hr. and leaves at 1050°F.

1.4.2 Blanket

Separated from the core by a one inch molten lead reflector is a
stationary blanket of depleted uranium present as a paste of uranium oxide
powder in sodium under a 100 psi pressure. Located within the blanket is a
stainless steel clad zones of graphite 5 1/8 inches thick. The presence of
the graphite increases the neutron moderation and results in a smaller size
blanket. |

«19-

—

 
 

Blanket cooling is obtained by passing sodium through tubes located

throughout the blanket, Sodium is introduced into the blanket at 1050°F at

a flow rate of 7.6 x 10° 1bs/hr and leaves at 1200°F. The blanket sodimm,
vhich is considerably radioactive, then enters a horizontal sodiur to sodium
heat exchanger and heats the inlet sodium from 900°F to 1050°F. The sodium
from the blanket heat exchanger is then manifolded with the sodium from the
core heat exchanger and passes to a straight through boiler. At full load
conditions, the feed water enters the boller at 550°F and 2500 psi at a flow -
rate of 2.62 x 10° 1bs/hr and produces steam at 1000°F and 2400 psi which

passes to a conventional turbine generator electrical plant.
1.4.3 Control

The routine operation of the reactor will be controlled by the
negative temperature coefficient which is sufficient to offset reactivity
fluctuations due to expected differences in the reactor mean temperature.

Reactor shim required for fuel burn-up will be obtained by variation

in the height of the molten lead reflector. Approximately one quarter of

one per cent reactivity will be available for shim by the increased height

of the lead. When fuel burn-up requires more reactivity than is available

~ from the reflector, compensating changes will be made in the fuel concentration

and the reflector height will be readjusted.

In the event of an excursion, provisions will be nade to dump the entire

core contents in less than J seconds and in addition, to dump the lead re-

flector. Dumping the reflector would provide a change in reactivity of about

1.6 per cent,

1.4., Chemical Processing

Chemical processing of the core and blanket, other than removal

and absorption of fission gases, will take place at a large central processing
facility capable of handling the throughput of about 15 power reactors. The
chemical process for both the eore and blanket will embody the main features
of the purex type solvent extraction process, with different head end treat-
ments required to make each materiel adaptable to the subsequent processing
steps. |

Core processing will take place on a five year cycle whereas the blanket
will be processed bieannually. The plutonium product from the chemical process

is finally obtained as the chloride which can be recycled to the reactor.

 
 

 

CHAPTER II
PRELIMINARY REACTOR DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

2,1 SELECTION OF CORE FUEL

One of the objectives of this project was the torough avestigation of
a fused salt fuel system, Preliminary discussions resulted in the decision
that a core and blanket breeding systen would be investigated.

A fused chloride fuel appeared the most promising of the fused salt
systems, The core fuel system studied was a fused Na C1, Mg Cl,, UC1, end

PuCl, salt. The results of preliminary nuclear celculations gave the fused

salt composition as 9 mols NaCl, 6 mols Mgll,, 2 mols UC; and 1 mol of PuCls,

The uranium is 7238,

2.1.1 Criteria for Selection

The principal properties that the core fuel system should possess

1, Low parasitic neutron sbsorption cross section.
2. Low moderating power and inelastic scattering.
3. Liquid below 500°C.
bo Radioactively stable.
56 Thermally stable.
6. Non-corrosive to the materials of construction.
7. Low viscosity.
8. Appreciable uranium and plutonium content at temperatures of

the order of 650°C.
9. High thermal conductivity.

common and ohed rt

 

For fast reactors, the choice of salts containing fissionable and non-
fissionsble elements ‘is limited to those in which the non-fissionable elements

have a low slowing down power and low cross sections for absorption and inelastic

scattering of fast neutrons. In general, elements of atomic weight less than

twenty are unsatisfactory because of their moderating effect. This eliminates
many of the common diluents which contain hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen.
Salts which ere suitable nuclearwise are further restricted to those which
are thermodynenically and chemically stable. The salts must be stable at the
operating temperature) of the reactor, 475° C. Also the liquidus temperature
of the fused salt Ni should be. below 500°C. This is desirable so that more
ructursl erie ney be used. The higher the temperature

requirement is r the diluents must dissolve the necessary quantities of .

Based u the aforementioned requirements the halide family appeared
the most me ising. Of the halides, chlorides and fluorides were the initial
choices, The bromides and io ides were eliminated because of their high
absorption cross sections. /! emtse pas. an average Og at 1 mev of 30 mb and
iodine hes a G, of 105 mb at this suergy. Chlorine and fluorine have captured
cross seétions of 0. 7% b and 0,2 mb respectively.

Originally, it appoared that there vere available 3 possible fuel systems;
one using chlorides, one utilizing fluorides and a third using a mixture of -
fluorides and chlorides. Chlorides presented the obvious disadvantage of a
higher capture cross section, The flourides were detrimental because of their
moderating effect. After a more thorough investigation, the fluorides were

ruled out because of their prohibitively high inelastic scattering cross
section in the energy range of interest, Preliminary nuclear calculations
using fluorides showed the neutron energy spectrum decidedly lowered.

Ultimately the mixed halides system of chloride end fluoride was eliminated
because of the high melting points of the fluorides. This step was taken only
after it had been verified that a chloride fused salt system was feasible with
respect to the nuclear requirements of our reactor.

Once it was determined that the fused chlorides would be used, great
effort was expended in the selection of the particular salts to use. One of
the most important physical properties required wes & low melting point
for the salt mixture. It was felt that a ternary system would be most suitable.
A binary would have too high a melting point while a quaternary presented
many unknowns such as formation of compounds; and in general is too difficult
to handle.

The core fuel system will utilize plutonium which is to be froduced in
the blanket. Since there exists very meager information on plutonium fused
salts, it was decided that as a fair approximation’, many of the properties
of uranium salts would be used. This appears to be a valid assumption for
physicals properties since plutonium and uranium salts form a solid solution.

As a preliminary step, possible diluent chlorides were reviewed. Keeping
the basic requirements in mind and reviewing whatever binary phase diagrams
were available, the following salts showed promise 2x1, PrCl,, MgCl, NaCl,
KC1, and CaCl,. ZrCl was rejected since it 1s expensive and might produce
the snow problem experienced in otherfused salt systems. PECL, was rejected
since it is very reactive with all known structural materials, From the four
remaining possibilities, the MgCl, and NaCl salts were selected as diluents.

In addition to possessing many of the requirements, they had the lowest liquidus
temperature, As for the fissionable salt, the trichloride or tetrachloride
were the possibilities, PuCl, and UC1, were selected because of the thermal
instability of the tetrachlorides. Hence the core fused salt system selected
is made up of NaCl, MgCl, cl, and PuCl,. As was pointed out earlier, the
physical properties of our system were investigated using NaCl, MgCl, and UC15.

The PuCl, is assumed to be in solid solution with the UG14.

2.1.2 Fuel Properties

Since the ternary properties of the proposed fuel were completely un-

‘known, extrapolations of the known binary systems (shown in Figs. 2.1, 2.2, 2.3)

...were made.

On the basic assumption that the ternary chloride system was a simple
one and containing none of the anomalous behavior of the known fluoride systems,
the pictured (Fig. 2.4) ternary diagram was drawn.?

To give some indication of the melting temperature to be expected in
our system, a series of melting point determinations was undertaken, The data
recorded are summarized below. (The test procedure is described in the

Appendix C).

Semple | Melting Point
MgOl, NaCl UCI, - Liouidus Solidus
#1 38.6%-57.91% ~ 3.49% | 435°C 420%
#2 36.36%-54.548-9.10% | 432% 415%
#3 33.33%-50.014-16.66% 505°-440°C 405°C

Sample #3 corresponds to the composition of the fuel selected.

In conjunction with the melting point tests, a petrographic analysis was
conducted of the fuel mixture. On the basis of this analysis, neither Rall,
MgCl, nor UC1, were detectable in the solidfied fuel. There were two dis-
tinguishable phases present, one a colorless crystal and the other a brown
crystal, which was not as prevalent as the colorless one. The compositions
of the phases could not be determined. It was observed that the mixture was
very hygroscopic and was easily oxidized in air.

The remaining physical properties were estimated by analogy to the fluoride
systems which have been studied. Densities were calculated by the density

correlations of Cohen and Jones (3). Thermal conductivities, heat capacities,

and viscosities were estimated directly from fluoride data.

2,2 SELECTION OF BLANKET MATERIAL

A uranium dioxide-liquid sodium paste was selected as one of the pro-
mising blenket materials, Although only & limited amount of work has been

done on pastes, the prospects for its use are very good.
2.2.1 Criteria for Selection

The important characteristics of a satisfactory blanket material
are:

1. Low cost.

2. High concentration of the fertile material.

3. Cheaply fabricated.

4. Low chemical processing costs.

5. Good thermal conductivity.

6. Low neutron losses in non-fertile elements.

7. Low melting point.

Natural or depleted uranium were obvious choices for the fertile material.
Either material is acceptable, the governing factor being the cost. At the
present time, the cost of depleted uranium is considerably less than natural
uranium and vas chosen as the fertile material in the blanket. |

Several blanket systems were investigated. The more prominent possi-
bilities were UO pellets in molten sodium, UO, powder in molten sodium, canned
solid uranium, fused uranium salts and vo, slurries. | |

Uranium dioxide pellets in molten sodium appeared very promising. vo, is
unreactive with and very slightly soluble in liquid sodium. Cooling could be
accomplished by liquid sodium flowing in tubes. It was estimated that approx-

-31-

 
 

 

 

imately 65% of UO, by volume could be obtained. This blanket system was re-

| Jected because of the high cost of manufacturing the pellets. It was estimated

that over 50 millions of pellets would be required to fill the proposed blanket
volume of 100 cubic feet.

A solid uranium canned in stainless steel was investigated. The major
edventages of this system is the high uranium concentration. This material was
rejected due tO the high costs of fabrication. Typical costs are about $9 per
kilogram for machining — and $7 per kilogram of uranium for the addition
of the cladding material.

Fused uranium salts would have been the logical choice since fused sslte
were being used in the core. This would halve many of the problems confrorting
the design of the system such as corrosion, chemical processing, etc. The
only fused salts which would give a sufficient concentration of uranium in the

blanket were UCl, or UCL, or a mixture of the two. Ucl has too high a melting

3
point, while UCL), proved to be too corrosive. Even the Uc, - ucl) mixture was

(2)

felt to be too corrosive for a long life system. Hence this material was
eliminated.

A Ww, slurry was rejected due to the lack of knowledge of the properties
of the slurry andi the low uranium concentration due to engineering considera~

tions.

The U0,-Na. paste was ultimately selected as the best available blanket material.

Thies system has many of the features of the Uo, pellet system with the omission
of the cost of manufacturing pellets. Although only a limited esmount of work

has been done on pastes, the outlook is very promising. A uo, = Na paste offers
low febricatlion cost, ease of handling, high concentration of U0, end. good hest
transfer properties. From a personal communication with BM. Abraham of Argonne

National Leboratory, it was estimated that as mich as 80% UO, by volume in

«32a

 
Nn

 

liquid sodium is possible using a centrifugation process. We plan to use a
paste composed of 70% volume in the blanket system. The purpose of the liquid
godium in the blanket is to improve the heat transfer properties. It is be-
lieved that Pu and U metal will be stable with liquid sodium and no reaction
occurs between Na and UO,. A major problem was the possibility of Na,0
formation and its adverse corrosive effects. This was solved by the addition

of corrosion inhibitors. A discussion of this can be found in section 2.4.2.

 
 

\

2.3 REACTOR COOLANT SYSTEM

The externally cooled system eppears superior to the internally cooled
system for a fused salt fast breeder reactor. In the externally cooled system,
the fuel mixture is circulated through a heat exchanger external to the reactor
vessel. The internally cooled system has heat transfer surfaces within the
reactor vessel; and heat is transferred from the fuel mixture to a fluid
coolant which In turn is cooled in an external heat exchanger.

2.3.1 Internal Cooling

A possible adventage of the internally cooled system is the lower inven-
tory of core fuel. However, due to the characteristically low heat transfer
property of fused salts, it was calculated that almost 50% of the core volume
would be occupied by tubing and coolant in order to facilitate the required
cooling. The high percentage of tubing and coolant affects this reactor system
in two ways; First the parasitic capture is greatly increased and secondly,
the neutron energy spectrum is decidedly lowered. The above effects result in a

reduced breeding ratio in the core.

2.3.2 External Cooling

The externally cooled system was selected for use in the reactor system
investigated. The deciding factor in the choice was that a breeding ratio
of 1.20 was estimated in the externally cooled system compared to only
0.8 for the internally cooled system. This higher breeding ratio is obtainable
because of about 15% greater blanket coverage, less parasitic capture and
higher neutron energy spectrum. Another factor in favor of external cooling
1s the ease of replacement of equipment in case of a heat exchanger failure.

2.4 MATERIALS OF CONSTRUCTION

The choice of materials of construction in most reactor systems is
quite difficult because of the lack of corrosion data in the presence of
radiation fields. In spite of the lack of technological development, an effort
was made to select the materials of construction for this reactor system.

The core vessel will be a nickel -molybdenum alloy, which is presently
in the development stage. For the other parts of the core system such as the
primary heat exchanger and piping, a nickel-molybdenum alloy cladding on
stainless steel appears to be satisfactory. The blanket system will utilize
stainless steel throughout. As far as the reactor components go, 1t can be
generally said that all the components in contact with the fused salt shall
be nickel-molybdenum clad or constructed of nickel-moly and all components in
contact with sodium are to be constructed of stainless steel.

Tests are now in progress at the ORNL Corrosion Laboratory to obtain
some data on the corrosion of the fused salt of this system on nickel and

inconel at 1350°F.

2.4.1 Core System
Since the operating temperature of the fused selt shall be as high

as 1350°F, the choice of construction materials was severely limited. A further
limitation was imposed by the absence of corrosion data of fused chlorides
on structural metals. The possibilities which existed were inconel, nickel-
moly clad on stainless, hastelloy metals, or nickel-molybdenum alloys of the
hastelloy type which currently are under development.

In selecting the best material, much dependence was placed on the individual

chemical and physical properties. of these possibilities with respect to the

-35-

 
 

fused chloride fuel.

The hastelloy metals were rejected due to the inability to fabricate the
material because of brittleness. Inconel was eliminated for the most part
because of its known diffusion of chromium from the alloy in fluoride salts.

In addition the corrosion data of inconel in the temperature range of interest
is lacking. It is felt that these disadvantages overbalance the high tech-
nological development and good physical properties of inconel.

The use of nickel-molybdenum alloy cladding on stainless steel asppemxt very

favorable in the fused chloride system.
| It is expected that this alloy will not exhibit dissimilar metal mass

transfer and will be capable of being welded to stainless steels by use of
special equipment. On the basis that this alloy will have the properties as

described, it is being recommended for the core system.

Rede? Blanket System

The construction material for all equipment in contact with the
sodium such as is present in the blanket will be stainless steel. Since the
blanket is to be composed of a U0,-Na paste, it was feared that the sodium
would become contaminated due to the formation of Na, 0 in the presence of
free oxygen. At elevated temperatures, ¥a,0 is very corrosive; it reacts with
all the common metals, platimm metals, graphite and ceramics. The relative
degree of reactivity with the structural materiels would be the following,
from the most attacked to the least: Mo, W, Fe, Co and Ni. In addition it
is believed that Na,0 would be strongly ebsorbed on most metal surfaces.

It is possible that since Nay0 is ‘known to act as a reducing agent for
some metals and an oxidizing agent for others, the presence of some material

wlll reduce Nay0 to Na before it attacks the metal, Such a corrosion inhibitor

-36~

 
 

0

o)

n

0

 

would solve this dilemma. The two common reactor materials, uranium and
beryllium could possibly serve as the inhibitor, Thermodynamically, each reacts
readily with Na,0 to form the metallic oxide and free sodium. At 500°C the
free energy of formation for beryllium and uranium are -46 Kcal per mole and
75 Keal per mole respectively.

The rate of these reactions has not been investigated except indirectly
in a series of corrosion tests at xapr?8, These tests show that both Be
end U are corroded many times faster than any of the structural metals tested.
The metals included nickel, molybdenum, inconel, momnel, 347 stainless steel
and 2-8 aluminum. Thus the addition of either pure uranium or beryllium to
the U0,-Na paste should offer ea high degree of resistance to the possible corro- |

sion by the Ka,0 which will be formed during irradiation.

2.4.3 Reactor Components

In general, all components in contact with the fused chloride fuel will

be constructed of nickel moly alloy clad stainless steel, All reactor components
in contact with sodium will be constructed of stainless steel.

CHAPTER 3 ENGINEERING
3.1 GENERAL

The reactor proper, as shown in Fig. 3.1, is a 120-inch 0.D. sphere

consisting of a blanket region and a core, The core is a 733-inch 0.D. sphere

with a 4 inch wall designed to withstand a differential pressure of 50 psi.

The core inlet nozzle on the bottom and the outlet nozzle on the top are
reinforced. The inlet has a series of screens to distribute the flow thru the

“core so that a scouring action is achieved.

Immediately outside the core shell is a one inch reflector of molten
lead in a J-inch stainless steel container. The filling or draining of the
molten lead is accomplished by pressurized helium. |

The first blanket region is 2 3// inches thick and is followed by 5 1/8
inches of moderator, another 5 5/16 inches of blanket and finally 8
inches of graphite reflector. The blanket is a uranium dioxide-sodiun paste
and the moderator is graphite cled with 1/8 inch of stainless steel.

The reflector, blanket and moderator are cooled by molten sodium passing
thru 34-inch 0,D. tubing.

The core heat output is 600 megawatts, and it is removed by circulating
the fuel thru a single pump and external heat exchanger with a minimum of

piping. The cooling circuit is fabricated using all-welded construction. The

fuel solution is heated to 1350°F as it flows up thru the core and is returned

to the core at 1050°F,

Any differential expansion will be absorbed in a pivoted expansion joint,
The blanket heat output is approximately 100 megawatts and it is removed
by circulating molten sodium which enters the blanket at 1050°F and leaves

at 1200°F thru tubes imbedded in the blanket as shown in Fig. 3.2. As
the core, the blanket cooling system has one pump, one heat exchanger, welded
Piping and a pivoted expansion joint.

The combined core and blanket system has three solid leg supports on the
blenket., Constant load hangers will carry the remaining load at four lugs
provided at the upper core elbow, at the core heat exchanger and at each end
of the blanket heat exchanger.

The basement floor of the reactor building, i" shown in Fig, 3.3, will
have a series of dump ‘tanks for the salt, The reactor floor and the main floor
will be constructed of removable. steel panels. The reactor room and the base-
ment room will be below ground level and contained in a steel lined concrete structure.

The reactor building main floor will have television facilities and a
remotely operated crane and will be enclosed in a 60 ft. diameter, one inch
thick steel shell, The steel shell is a safety measure and will prevent the
pollution of the atmosphere by radioactive materials in the event of an accident.
The steel shell, which will withstand 50 psi, will have two large airtight

hatches for equipment removal,

The blanket heat exchanger secondary sodium lines are siamesed with the
core heat exchanger sodium lines and the resulting 42 inch 0.D., lines are con-
nected to the shell side of a once-thru boiler.

The U-shaped boiler and the sodium pumps are located in a shielded boiler

room between the reactor building and the turbo-gemerator portlon of the plant.

The layout of the turbo-generator and auxiliaries follows the conventional
power plant design with two exceptions: an outdoor turbine floor with a gantry
crane and placement of the deasrator on the turbine floor because of the

elimination of the boiler superstructure.

The centralized control room is placed between the turbo-generator and
reactor buildings and ebove the boiler room. The stack, which is used for
¥ the dispersal of reactor off gases after a sufficient hold-up time to reduce

the radioactivity, is placed near the reactor building.
3.1.1. Properties of Fused Salt, Sodium Coolant, and Blanket Paste

The engineering properties of the fused salt, sodium coolant and
the UOo-Na paste blanket have been estimated by the following methods. The
} specific heat of the fused chloride salt as & function of uranium concentration

(Fig. 3.4) was estimated using the method described by W. D. Powers. Correlations

o

e were not availeble for the properties of thermal conductivity or visocity of

. the fused salts.
~~ The variation of the density, specific heat, thermal conductivity, and

viscosity of sodium? are given in Figures 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 respectively.
The density of UO, was taken as 10.2 g/cc and it was assumed that this re-
mained constant. The specific heat’ of UO, was taken as:

= 19.77 +1.092 x '10™°T - 4.68 x 1075 12 (Gal/oal c)
(Figure 3.9) :

The thermal conductivity’ of UG, is given in » Figure 3. 10.
The properties of the paste were then calculated, ustng a nixture of 70%

U0, 30% sodium by volume.

3.2 REACTOR POWER

The reserve capacity of an electric power system averages about 10 per
cent of the system load, To make such a system reliable, no single unit should
exceed 10 per cent of the system capacity. Since most of the systems in this
country are less than 3000 M{ capacity, turbo-generator units in excess of
280 M4 have not been built yet.

A reactor supplying steam for a single turbo-generating unit with a
system thermal efficiency of 40 per cent would be sized at 700 MW of heat, or
also 260 M{ net electric output because of auxiliary power requirements of 20 MW.
A system larger than 700 MW of heat would require more than one circulating
fuel heat exchanger. Two fuel heat exchangers would require manifolding and
other flexibility provisions which would result in a great increase in fuel
hold-up. Furthermore, too high & power level would involve such a large initial

investment that the risk of construction would not be warranted.

3.3 DESIGN OF HEAT TRANSPORT SYSTEM

Reference is made to Fig. 3.14 and Fig. 3.15, the Heat Balance Diagram
and the Salt, Sodium, Steam, and Condensate Flow Diagram, respectively.

The optimum design was approached by careful selection of design points,

Single wall tubing was assumed throughout which is in agreement with the
present trend of design. Smell leekage of water or steam into the sodium in

the boiler is not expected to cause serious difpiculty (12),

Detection may

be accomplished by providing a gas collecting chamber and off-tske in the
sodium return line, Build-up of NaCH in the sodium system should not be
difficult to follow and replacement or purification of the sodium can be under-
taken as it may appear necessary.

The influx of large amounts of water or steam resulting from a major
failure would dangerously increase the pressure in the shell; and although
this possibility 1s remote, safety valves will be provided.

Excessive fluid velocities result in erosion, corrosion, vibration and
increased pressure drop. Based on past experiences in the field, the maximum
velocity was taken as J900/¢" £4. /sec. where § is the specific gravity of
the fluid,

Fluld-fuel reactors, especially those with external cooling, are part-
icularly lable to be ehut down for repair or replacement of equipment (13),

It is highly desirable, therefore, that all components be as simple end as de-
pendable es possible but also sable to be speedily replaced or remotely main-
tained. It 1s considered undesireble to install valves in the large lines be-
tween the core and blanket heat exchangers and the pumps to permit shut-off

of possible spare equipment or to regulate flow. These valves would be large,
would operate at high temperatures and would handle corrosive fluids. It is

‘more probable that these valves would fail before trouble is experienced at

the heat exchangers or pumps.

Since no maintenance can be attempted with radioactive fluids in the re-
actor and since it is not expected that any reactor part will last five years
without requiring replacement or repair, provisions will be made to inspect
all components thoroughly at least every two years, i.e., when replacing the

core heat exchanger.

3.3.1 Circulating Fuel Heat Exchanger

To reduce external hold-up, small tube sizes are desirable in the
heat exchanger. The 4-inch 0,D. tube size was selected as a practical
minimum, For sizes less than 4 inch, conuiderable difficulty would arise in
fabrication of the heat exchangers while the possibility of plugging would be
greatly increased. The wall thickness of 50 mils was assumed to provide
corrosion resistance for two years of useful life.

For the secondary heat transfer fluid, & medium was required with good
heat transfer properties in order to reduce the external hold-up and with high
boiling point to permit operation at high temperature and low pressure to re-
duce capital costs.

Sodium, 11thium, NaK, bismuth, lead and mercury were considered as heat

transfer media, Sodium was selected because of its good heat transfer pro-

perties, high boiling point, low cost, availability, comparative ease of handling

and wide technological experience, The disadvantages of sodium are its violent
reaction with water and the catastrophic corrosion rate of Na,O0.
The following considerations were used to set the temperature limits for
the fluids entering and leaving the core and heat exchangers.

The coolant temperature is not to be less than the liquidus temperature
of the fuel, i.e. 870°F. The temperatures of the fuel and coolant leaving the
core and heat exchanger were set by economic, corrosion and engineering con-
siderations. Low fuel outlet temperature would lead to excessive heat ex-
changer surface which would adversely affect the fuel inventory and increase |
the possibility of mass transfer. High fuel outlet temperature would increase
the corrosion rate, require higher pumping power and increase the thermal
stresses, Low sodium outlet temperature would result in excessive thermal
stresses and lower thermal cycle efficiency. High sodium outlet temperature
would have the same result as low fuel outlet temperature.

The fuel outlet temperature was set at 1350°F to ensure reasonable equip-
ment life and the maximum temperature differential between fuel and sodium was
set at 300°F, which is in egreement with general design practices.

The heat exchanger is a single pass counterflow exchanger approximately
50 inches in diameter and 20 feet long with 3500 tubes. All tubes will be
made from a corrosion resistant nickel-molybdemum alloy (about 80% Ni and 20%
Mo). The exchanger shell will be constructed of stainless steel with a 4 inch
Ni-Mo cladding. |

The removal and replacement of the core heat exchanger requires remote

handling which is believed to be entirely feasible.
3.3.2 Circulating Fuel Piping and Pump

The pipe size selected was 2/-inch 0.D. with a one-inch wall thickness.
To reduce cost, the pipe material will be stainless steel clad on the inside
with a corrosion resistant Ni-Mo alloy. Cladding thickness will be #4 inch to

provide e corrosion allowance for five years life. To allow differential thermal

expansion, a pivoted expansion joint is provided.

‘A single pump arrangement was selected, because two circulating fuel
pumps would require two check valves, four shut-off valves and added provisions
for flexibility. This would increase the external hold-up and because of valve
stem leakage probabilities, would lower the system reliability. However, if
large, reliab le valves become available, it might be advantageous to have the
added flexibility afforded by multiple cooling systems. This is a matter for
further development.

A canned-rotor pump was selected instead of a shaft-seal pump due to the
greatly reduced possibility of leakage. The fuel pump will run at constant
speed because of its eanned-rotor construction. A variable speed pump would

be preferable but this also requires further development.

- 3.3.3 Blanket Heat kxchanger

The blanket heat exchanger is a sodium to sodium exchanger constructed
of stainless steel and whose mean temperature difference is 150°F. It has
1570 tubes of 4-inch 0.D. which are 74 feet long with 50-mil walls.

It was deemed necessary to have an intermediate loop on the blanket system
due to the activation of the sodium coolant. Thus, in case of a sodium-water
reaction, only radioactively cool sodium would be ejected. The choice of
sodium as a secondary blanket coolant was deemed advisable since the core second-
ary coolant and the blanket secondary coolant could be mixed, thus necessitating
only one boiler and a slight amount of manifolding. For this same reason, the
secondary sodium is designed to have a 150°F temperature rise through the heat
exchanger (900°F to 10509F), thus matching the sore sodium,

The first blanket region is 7 cm. thick and has 60 Mi of heet generated in it.
The second region is 13.5 cm. thick with 40 MV generated in it. The heat flows
by conduction through the paste to the wetted tubes where it is then cerried
away by convection in liquid sodium,

In blanket region 1, there are 940- 4 inch stainless steel tubes whose
centers lie on circles of radii 38.4, 39.1 and 39.9 inches. Each row contains
equal numbers of tubes which have an effective length of 8 ft. Under these
conditions, the maximum possible paste temperature will be 1396°F which is well
below the refractory temperature of 1832°F,

In blanket region 2, there are 630- 4 inch stainless steel tubes whose
centers lie on circles of radii 51.8, 53.5 and 55.3 inches. Each row contains
equal numbers of tubes which have an effective length of 10 ft. The maximum
paste temperature in region 2, under these conditions, will be 1468°F,

In region 1, the cooling tubes occupy less than 30 per cent of the availl-
able volume while in region 2 the tubes occupy less than 15 per cent of the

available volume,

3.3.4.1 Parameter Study of Blanket Heat Transfer System

For efficient cooling of the blanket, we expect to match the
cooling tube density to the radial distribution of heat generation.

It will be assumed that the basic cooling tube lattice arrangement oan
be simulated by concentric cylinders. The generation rate in a cell will be
taken as constant and the Na-UO, paste will be considered stagnant. The pro-
perties of Na and Na-UO, paste are graphically presented in Section 3.1.1.

3.3.5 Blanket Piping and Pump

The total pressure drop in the blanket is 145 £4. of head. This
includes the losses through the blanket tubes, four plemum chambers, 10.67 ft.
of 18-inch 0.D. pipe, four elbows, one expansion joint, heat exchanger tubes,
blanket tube sheets and heat exchanger tube sheets.

The blanket sodium pump is a rotary pump with a capacity of 18,700 Gm
of sodium against a 145 ft. head. With a pump efficiency of 70 per cent, the
motor required for the pump is a nominal 1000 hp.

The blanket is filled by pumping the U0,-Na paste into the blanket vessel,
under a helium pressure of 100 psi., prior to the reactor start-up. The blanket
will be completely filled and any expansion of the paste will be taken up in
the blanket expansion tank.

To empty the blanket, part of the paste will be forced out, using 100 psi.
helium. Pure sodium will then be used to dilute and wash out the remainder
of the paste. When enough sodium is added, the paste will assume the properties

of a slurry and will flow quite easily.

3.3.6 Sodium Piping and Pumps

The pipe sizes selected are 18-inch 0.D., for the blanket hest ex-
changer and 42-inch O.D, for the main lines to the boiler. The piping material
will be stainless steel. Sodium valves located in the lines will be plug-type
with freeze seals,

Canned-rotor pumps were selected in preference to the electro-magnetic
pumps because of their higher efficiency. The total flow is 114,000 Gm. which
requires at least four pumps with 28,500 Gm. and 65 ft. head.

Provisions are made to drain and store all sodium in the event of a shut-
down. A one-foot thick concrete shield surrounds the sodium system including
the boller. The sodium pumps will be shielded so that they can be drained and

replaced individually without denger to personnel.

3.4 SALT DMP SYSTEM

A salt dump system is provided consisting of two valved drain lines, one

for the core and one for the heat exchanger snd piping. The lines are 12 inches

and 8 inches, respectively, and are sufficient to drain the entire system in

four seconds.

The dump tanks will have a combined capacity of 10 per cent in excess of
the total circulating fuel volume, The tanks will be compartmentalized to
keep the fuel subcritical; and cooling provisions will be provided to remove
decay heat, Electric heating elements will be included to prevent the fuel
from solidifying.

The fuel will be removed from the dump tanks by a 5 Gm., 130 ft. head
pump either back to the core or to a container to be shipped for processing.

The tanks, piping and pump will be constructed similarly to the main eir-
culating fuel system, i.e., nickel-molybdenum alloy clad stainless steel to

provide an allowable corrosion resistance for 10 years of useful life,

3.5 CORE VESSEL AND REFLECTOR HEATING

In this system, as in most reactor systems, the internal generation of
heat in the core vessel due to gamma and neutron interactions with the metal
was found to be appreciable. The energy sources considered for this calculation
were prompt fission gammas, decay product gammas, and neutrons of energies
greater than 0,12 Mev, The inelastic scattering gammas in the fuel and the core
vessel were estimated as negligible with respect to the magnitude of the con-
sidered sources. These sources gave a gamma spectrum as shown in Fig. 3.17.

Using this integral spectrum and assuming it to be unchanged in space
we applied the Integral Beam Approximation method (15) (Appendix A-7). The heat
generation rate in the core vessel and reflector was calculated as a function
of position. The gamma absorption coefficients of the fused salt (Fig. 3.18)
and of the nickel-molybdemum alloy (Fig. 3.19) were computed for use in this
calculation. The gamma heat generation rate as a function of position is
shown in Fig. 3.20.

The heat generation due to neutron capture, elastic scattering, and in-
elastic scattering were calculated using the integral fluxes from the Univac
calculations with the general equation: |

culations show that this is more than adequate to transfer the heat,

flector. It was found that approximately one third of the total heat generation >
in the core vessel was due to gamma interactions. Using these averaged heat
generation rates a maximum temperature rise of 109.3 °F was estimated for the
core vessel (Fig. 3.21). Since such a temperature rise was believed to cause -
abnormally high thermal stresses, it was decided to cool the lead reflector.

This gave a maximum temperature rise in the core vessel of 29,2°F (Fig. 3.22).

This was estimated to yield permissible thermal stresses. =

In all these calculations the core vessel was teken to be 1.3 cm. thick;
and the lead reflector, 2.5 cm. thick.

In order to maintain the 29.2°F temperature rise in the core shell and
to minimize the thermal stresses, it was postulated that both surfaces of the
core vessel be maintained at the same temperature of 1350°F and that heat be *
removed from the reflector to accomplish this. It was also postulated that
both surfaces of the reflector are at 1350°F. Using these conditions it was .
found that 5.2 x 1013 Mov/em>-sec will be removed from the lead reflector.

Q = 5.2 x 1013 Mov/em’sec = 3.80 x 10° BIU/Ar. = 1.11 Mi.

3.6 MODERATOR COOLING

The heat generation in the moderator due to fast neutron moderation is
3.5 x 102 nev. which yields a heat generation of 6.15 x 10°8 mev, or
cc.-seC. sec.
3.36 x 105 BTU _ in the entire volume, With this heat generation rate, a sodium
hr.
flow of 1.13 x 10° lbs, is required to maintain the maximum temperature of the
hr

 

graphite at 1325°F, The sodium flow rate is accomplished in 25 34-inch cooling
tubes with 50 mil wells.

3.7 QNCE-THRU BOILER

The once-~thru bojler is well suited to the high temperature reactor plant,
since load conditions can be controlled by varying the flow of water, If the
reactor follows its load demand well, it can be controlled directly by the
turbine throttle. Thus, operation of the plant is greatly simplified. However,
the once~-thru boiler is not yet well developed end in this case is eperating
very near the burn-out point. This is perhaps one of the weakest points in the
design. It definitely requires further study and possibly enother intermediate
sodium loop to lower the inlet sodium temperature to the boiler. This type of
boiler requires very pure feed water of less than + ppm. impurity present.

The boiler is in the form of a shell and tube, counter current, one-pass
heat exchanger with the 2400 psi steam on the tube side. There are 2400 tubes
vhich ere $-inch 0.D., 45 ft. long, with a 50 mil wall, The entire boiler will
be made of stainless steel which is resistant to attack by both hot sodium and |
super heated steam. The tubes are in a triangular lattice with a 1.11 inch
pitch which leaves sufficient room for welding the tubes into the tube sheet.

The inside shell diameter is 4.9 £4, and its wall thickness is one inch

which is sufficient to hold the sodium. The overall shell length is 50 ft.

~75-

 
 

which includes two 2% ft. plemums. The boiler was made into a U-shape in
order to reduce the size of the boiler room. |

The design was accomplished by breaking the ‘boiler Ipto three distinct
reglons~--a sub-cooled reglon, & boiling region and a superheated region. This
is only an approximation as it is mainly a philosophical point as to where sub-
cooled boiling ends and net boiling begins. The heat transfer coefficients

were calculated using the Dittus-~Boelter equations)

s and a method of J. A.
Lane (16) was used in the boiling region.

In calculating heat transfer coefficients, use was made of inlet velocities
only. This is clearly an underestimate, and the excess surface should account
for the resistance of the scale to heat transfer.

At part-load operation, this boiler tends to produce steam at higher than
design temperature. The steam temperature to the turbine will be maintained |
constant by attemperation and variation of the boiler feed water temperature.

The part-load operating characteristics of the boiler are given in the following

table.

3.8 AUXILIARY COOLING SYSTEM

If the electric load is dropped to zero, it becomes necessary to remove
delayed heat from the reactor core and blanket. An auxiliary cooling system
is provided for this, consisting of a separate sodium circuit, a sodim-to-air

heat exchanger and a pump.
3.9 TURBO-GENERATCOR

A tandem-compound, triple flow, 3600 rpm. turbo-generator with initial
steam conditions of 2400 psig. and 1000 F was selected. Since a straight-thru
boiler is being used, there is no reheat. The latter generally is not too
desirable for nuclear power plants because of the attendant complicated controls.

The feed water cycle will consist of six heaters with the deserator in
number three place. The final feed water temperature is 550°F. Three condensate
and three boiler feed pumps are specified to insure the reliability of the unit.

The thermal efficiency of the cycle is estimated to be 40 per cent. Auxil-

lary power requirements are estimated to be seven per cent.

CHAPTER 4 NUCLEAR CONSIDERATIONS
L.1 SUMMARY OF STUDY INTENTIONS

At the onset of the project, two cooling systems for a fused salt reactor
were considered, One was an internally cooled system in which the coolant,
liquid sodium, was passed through the core of the reactor. The other was an
externally cooled reactor in which the fuel was circulated through a heat ex-
changer enternal to the core. It was felt that the large fuel inventory of
a fast reactor would be increased to & prohibitive amount in the circulating
fuel system. However, early calculations shoved, that because of the large
amount of parasitic absorption, the total inventory of the internally cooled
system was about the same as that of the circulating system, Poorer blanket
coverage, more parasitic capture and lower spectrun caused the internally cooled
system to have a breeding ratio estimated to be about 0.8 compared to an esti-
mate of about 1.2 for the circulating system. The lower spectrum would also
increase the fission product poisoning. For these reasons and since the only
advantage attributed to the internally cooled system, lower inventory, did not
exist, 1t was decided to conduct parameter studies solely for mixed chloride
fuels in an externally cooled system.

Preliminary analysis (sec. 4.4.1) indicated that power output per mass
of plutonium increased with increased power. A core power of 600 MJ was chosen
as it is the upper limit imposed by existing electric power distribution systems.
Engineering considerations ylelded a minimum external hold-up volume for the
removal of 600 M{. This volume is so large that it remains essentially constant
over a wide variation of core sizes.

With the external hold-up volume constant a study was carried out on system

mass and breeding ratios as a function of composition of the mixed chloride
fuel, It was realized very early in the study that, at the concentrations of
the plutonium and uranium chlerides involved, the breeding ratio was higher
and the critical mass about the same when U-238 was used as a diluent instead
of the other chlorides. The salt of composition 3 NaCl, 2 MgCl, and 1 Pu (U)
Clj, which is the highest concentration of Pu (0) Cl, in the mixed chloride
commensurate with melting point requirements was, therefore, used in the pare-
meter study with variation on the ratio of plutonium to uranium. The analysis
was carried out employing a ten group, one dimensional diffusion theory method
(sec. 4.2.1) on the bare core system to find the bare core radius, breeding
ratios, and flux energy spectrum, Blanket cross sections were then averaged
over this spectrum to obtain an approximation of reflector savings on eritical
core radius. Okrent=~ has shown the validity of diffusion theory calculations
for fast reactor systems with dimensions greater than 30 em.

| Since the blanket materisl chosen has a low uranium density, an effort
was made to lower the neutron spectrum in the blenket to increase the plutonium
production density and decrease the blanket thickness. Position and thickness
of a graphite moderator section, placed in the blanket region, were varied

to study results on breeding ratio and concentration and distribution of plut-
onium production as well as the effects reflected back into the core. The
Argonne National Lab. RE-7 code for the UNIVAC (Sec. 4.2.3) was used for this
study employing 13 energy groups and 7 spatial regions.

: Reflector control is possible for a high core leskage reactor, such as:
in the present design. A brief study was performed on the effect of changing
the level of a molten lead reflector adjacent to the core vessel, These cal- -
culations were then performed more accurately employing a 10 energy group, 3

spatiel region code on a digital computer.

The calculation of the bare system criticality was therefore reduced to
e tabulation of neutron events with an iteration on the geometric buckling,

B, until a neutron balance was obtained over all energy groups. The calculation

begins with the introduction of one fission neutron distributed over the fission
spectrum. In the first (highest energy) group this is the only source of
neutrons so that the events in this group can be tabulated. Group 1 then pro-
vides the balance of the source for the second group through scattering, hence
the events in the second group can be determined, This procedure was continued

for each lower energy group. At the conclusion of the lowest energy group

bare system were found by summation over all energy groups. A new radius was
chosen and the calculation repeated until the neutron production and loss were
equal.

for each energy group multiplied by the average velocity of that group times

4.2.2 Reflector Savings Estimate

The flux energy spectrum obtained for the bare core was assumed, for
the reflector savings estimate, to be the equilibrium blanket flux energy spec-
trum, Averaging blanket parameters over this spectrum and assuming an infinite
blanket, the reflector savings was found to be insensitive to the bare core
radius and bare core spectrum over the range of interest. For the study of
system mass, breeding ratios and flux energy spectrum as & function of the plut- |

onium to uranium ratio, the reflector savings on the bare core radius was assumed

to be a constant.

4e2.3 UNIVAC Calculations

 

In order to obtain a better representation of the effect of the blanket
afl

 
 

on the core end to gain information on the desirability of a moderator section
in the blanket region, the Re=7 Argonne National Laboratory code for the UNIVAC
was employed, The iteration in this code was performed on the fuel to diluent
ratio rather than the core radius. The optimum system core radius from the
previous parameter study and seven regions (core, core vessel, lead reflector,
first blanket, moderator, second blanket and graphite reflector) were used.
Extra lower energy groups were employed because of the lower energy spectrum
in the blanket.

The input information, calculation procedures and restrictions of the RE-7
code are covered in reference 23. The results of the problem consisted of
the criticel fuel to diluent ratio, the criticality factor, the fission source
at each space point, the integral of the fission source over each region, the
flux at each space point in each energy group, the integral flux over each

region in each energy group, and the net leakage out of each region in each

4.3 CROSS SECTIONS

4.3.1 Exergy Groups

For the UNIVAC calculations thirteen energy groups were employed.
These are presented in Table 4.1, section 4.3.4. The last four groups were

combined into one group in the bare ten group parameter study.
4.3.2 Sources of Data

All total and fission cross sections as well as the (n, gamma) of
uranium-238 and the (n, alpha) of chlorine were obtained from BNL-325., The
capture cross section of plutonium was calculated using values of ox employed
in reference 2). The inelastic scattering cross section of uranium and plut-
onium were obtained through a private communication with L. Dresner of ORNL,

These values were based on the experimental work of T. W. Bonner of Rice Institute,
M. Walt of LASL and R, C. Allen of LASL. The sources of other inelastic scatter-
ing cross sections are references 25, 26, and 27. The spectrum of inelastically
scattered neutrons was taken, for all elements, to be Maxwellian in form with

the temperature of the distribution given by the equation e-/E -0, vhere E

is the initial neutron energy, b was assumed to be 20,7 Mev~l and constant and

¢ was taken as 0,08 Mev for high energy neutrons and extrapolated to zero at

the threshold. In reference 28, this form is used and gives good sgreement for
incident neutron energies of 1.5, ‘3 and 14 Mev.

Measured values of the transport cross section of carbon, iron, lead and
wranium-238 were obtained from reference 29. Additional values for these elements
and all transport cross sections for the other elements were calculated using
the angular distribution of scattered neutrons obtained from reference 30, Cap-

-83-

 
 

ture cross sections for elements other than uranium and plutonium vere cal-

culated using the method described in Section 4.3.3.

4e3.3 Calculation of Capture Cross Sections

Because of the lack of experimental determination of capture cross
sections at the energies of interest (.001 to 10 Mev), a theoretical, energy
dependent equation employing persmeters which can be estimated with some

31

accuracy was normalized to data by Hughes”’™ of capture cross sections at 1 Mev.

The equation employed 1s that appearing as equation 4.2b in reference 32.

For nuclei where the level spacing has been experimentally

hi RESULES OF THE PARAMETER STUDIES
bok.) Preliminary Analysis

For an externally cooled system, the maximum power which can be re-
moved is proportional to the volume of the holdeup in the external heat ex-
changer. The system mass of plutonium is proportional to the total of the
system. Hence, an increase in the power removed at a given core volume results
in en increase in the ratio of power to the system mass of plutonium, There-
fore, the lowest inventory cost ig obtained with the maximm power out=put.

Engineering considerations yielded an external hold-up volume of 3510
liters for a core power of 600 MW, which was considered to be the maximm de-
sirable. With this external volume constant, a preliminary analysis was pers
formed to minimize the mass of plutonium. One ten group, bare core calculation
was performed with a wranium to plutonium ratio of unity in order to obtain a
typical core spectrum. This spectrum was used to average core parameters for a
"one~gpeed” parameter study of system mass of plutnoium variation vith core size.

coefficient which was obtained by averaging blanket parameters over the core

to core radius. Thus & typical AR of 18 cm was used for all cases.

For the reasons stated in section 41 the study was limited to con~
: sideration of a salt of composition 3NaCl, 2MgCl,, ( 1 ) PuCl,, and

¢ Xx UCl,, where x is the ratio of urenium to plutonium, N(28)/N(49). Cal-
relations were performed for various values of x to obtain bare core critical
mass, core flux energy spectrum, internal breeding ratio, and the net core
leakage which was used to obtain the maximum external breeding ratio,

The reflected core critical mass variation with the reflected core radius
1s plotted as Fig. 4.2. Note that the equation for M, in section 4.4.1 is of
the form

M, = kyR + kR>
where ka/ky 1s about 10~ so that for R less than 100 cm the deviation from
linearity should be less than 10 percent. This behavior is seen in Fig. 4.2
which is the result of multi-group treatment.

The system mass of plutonium obtained from the multi-group calculations
is given on Fig. 4.1 together with the prediction of section 4.4.1. It is
seen that the shapes of the two curves are similar and that the minimums fall
at the same reflected core radius. This indicates the validity of the assumption,
which was made in the preliminary analysis, that the parameters, when averaged
ove the core spectrum, were insensitive to a change of core radlus.

The system mass of plutonium and the breeding ratios are plotted as a
function of x on Fig. 4.3. Core flux energy spectrums for x equal to 0 and 1
are given as Fig. 4.42 and x equal to 2 and 3 as Fig. 4.4b. The rapid increase
of the system mass of plutonium as x decreases from 2 was considered to far
outweigh the advantages accrued from the higher breeding ratio and the higher

flux energy spectrum. Thus the optimum system was chosen to occur with x equal

to 2,

 
 

 

Lok4e3 Reflector Control
In a reactor with & high core leakage, control can be affected by

changing the fraction of the out-going core leaksge which is returned. Using
% molten lead reflector in vhich the level is varied, the largest contribution |
to control is due to the creation of a void surrounding the core, This void
results in some of the neutrons reflected by the blanket, which is now separated
from the core, to reenter the blanket directly. The change of reflection co-
efficient due to the separation of the blanket fram the core is calenleted assuming
that the neutrons leave the blanket in ea cosine spatial distribution. In terms of
the reflection coefficient with no separation the effective coefficient with a void
surrounding the reactor core is given by

ate Be

R+ tt (1 -cC)

where R 1s the core radius ani t is the thickness of the void shell. The
epproximate velues of of , t and R used in the system were oC egual to 0.5,
t T 2.5 cm, and R equalto 92 cm. For these values, or © is equal to 0.493.
Since the nev core leakage is epproximately one half the core neutron pPro-

duction,
2k 3 Ae oct = 0.01%
oC

Atomic Power Development Associates performed a three region, ten group
calculation to determine 4 k/k for the void control. These results give k/k
equal to 0.016.

boi Effect of a Moderator Section in the Hlanket Reglon
To determine the effect of a grephite moderator section in the blanket
region, UNIVAC calculetions employing seven spatial regions end thirteen energy
groups were carried out. For a constant total volume of moderator and blanket,

«Ol

LY]

 
 

sh

 

variations were made on moderator thickness and position.

The core flux energy spectrum with no moderator present in the blanket
region was identicel with that obtained with the thickest moderator section
used, considered at its closest approach to the core. Therefore, the only con-
siderations in choosing an optimum system were the concentration of plutonium
production in the blanket and the total breeding ratio. These two considerations
are shown in Figs. 4.5 and 4.6.

The effect of a moderetor section on the outer blanket flux energy spectrum
is shown in Fig. 4.7. The effective capture cross section of uranium-238 in
the outer blanket is 1.45 barns with the moderator section present and 0.68
barns when blanket material was substituted for the moderator.

Over the range of moderator thicknesses considered (0 to 13em), the total
breeding ratio varied only slightly whereas the average concentration of plut-
onium production increased by a factor of about 1,6 with the average concen-
tration in the outer blanket increasing by a larger factor. Thus the maximum
moderator thickness of thirteen centimeters and the minimum inner blanket
thickness of seven centimeters were chosen for the final system because of
higher average concentration and more uniform spatial distribution of the plut-

onium production in the blanket,

The spatial neutron flux distribution for each of the thirteen energy
groups is shown on Figs. 4.8, 49, and 4.10, These plots are for a core
vessel thickness of 5,1 cm, and a lead reflector thickness of 5.1 cm. These

238 in

values were subsequently reduced in order to increase the fast fissions in U
‘the blanket and to rediitt: the. parasitic captures in the core vessel and reflector.
Energy spectrums of the core, inmer blanket and outer regions are shown
on Fig, 4.11.

The number of fissions occuring below lethargy u vs. u is plotted as Fig. 4.12,

The total system mass of plutonium is 1810 kg. This extremely high vel ue
is primarily due to the low density of the mixed chloride salt and to the very
large external hold-up volume. Because of the low density and the lower thermal
conductivity of most low melting salts, this high inventory is an inherent
characteristic of fused salt systems. The effect of the high external hold-up
volume could possibly be improved somewhat by employing a salt with better heat

transfer characteristics.

CHAPTER 5 CONTROLS

5.1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
The control of a fast reactor is no more difficult than that of a thermal

reactor. Even though the prompt neutron lifetime is much shorter in a fast
reactor, the delayed neutrons are still the controlling factor. It is the mumber
of delayed neutrons eveileble that determines the ease with thich the reactor

is controlled. In e plutonium fueled reactor there is less than one-half the
number of delayed neutrons that are avaellshble in a reactor using #38 for fuel.
Also, & circulating fuel reactor reduces the effective number of delayed neutrons
aveileble for control because some are born in the loop outside the core and are
lost to the system. Therefore, the main difference between the control of a fast
and thermal reactor is in the method of control.

One method of control is with the use of a neutron absorber. This method
is not generally satisfacgory for fast reactors because of the low capture
cross sections for neutrons in the high energy spectrum. This requires that a
large amount of absorber material be moved in a relatively short time. Also,
the conversion ratio in a fast breeder reactor is lowered.

Another method of control is with the movement of fuel in the reactor. This
does not lower the conversion ratio but does present the additional problems of
having to remove the heat generated in the fuel rod and having to process
the rod. This method is not too practiceble in a circulating fuel reactor.

The use of a movable reflector appears to be the most practicable method
of controlling a circuleting fuel fest breeder reactor. This method has the
disedventage of having to move a large mass of reflector material in a short
period of time. It also lowers the conversion ratio slightly. However, this
method of control was selected for the reactor under consideration in this

project.

5,2 DELAYED NEUTRONS

The control of a fast reactor with only prompt neutrons available would
be extremely difficult because the average lifetime of prompt neutroms in a
fast system is of the order of 107° seconds. When delayed neutrons are avail-
able, the average neutron lifetime in the system becomes approximately 10~2
seconds. This increases greatly the ebility to control the reactor in a safe
manner.

The fraction of delayed neutrons emitted by the fast fission of plutonium
239 is 0.0023 and of wranium-238 is 0,0176. From the nuclear calculations
it was found that 5.7 percent of the total fissions are from uranium-238 so
that the delay fraction, Bs is 0.0032. This is the value when the fuel is
not being circulated.

In considering a circulating fuel reactor, it is obvious that a part of
the delayed neutrons will be emitted outside the core and therefore lost to
the system, The fraction of delayed neutrons that are useful to the circulating
fuel reactor under steady state conditions can be calculated from the ratio of
the average concentration of delayed neutron precursors in the core to the
concentration of delayed neutron precursQrs in the core when the fuel
is stagnant. This fraction for the ith delay group can be written as follows:3'

vhere )\ , is the decay constant, tg I" the time spent in the core by the cir-
culating fuel, and t, is the time spent outside the core by the fuel. The
average & was found to be 0.519. Since ome dollar of reactivity = oF =
0.0017, the reactivity dollar has been deflated nearly fifty percent due to

circulation of the fuel.

5.3 TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT OF REACTIVITY

The change in reactivity due to a change in temperature is of importance
to the stability and control of the reactor. The largest contribution to this
coefficient of reactivity is from the expansion of the fused salt. The following
derivation is for an approximate value due to the change in density of the

salt. :

so dk d (5.3.12)

From the curve of fused salt density vs. temperature (°F), it was found

that
dp a=b.2 X 107% ar

The average temperature of the fused salt in the core is 1200°F and the
average density is
7 = 2.5 g/om’ |
Hence dk~ dp = -3.3 x 107% ar
and the — coefficient of reactivity due to the expansion of the
fused salt is negative and approximately
3.3 x 10™% por F

The above approximation was verified by a ten group, three region machine
calculation which found the negative temperature coefficient of reactivity
to be 2.4 x 107% per °F.

Since there is mo experimental data on the ‘density of the fused salt being”
used in this reactor, it was felt that the high temperature densities as obtained
from theoretical calculations were not reliable; The temperature coefficient

=117-

 
 

 

 

of reactivity obtained using the theoretical densities appears to be on the Co.

high side, Therefore, 3.3 x 10% per °F was taken as an upper limit, The

lower limit used in simulator studies was 2 x 105 per °F. These values appear
to bracket the coefficients used in the design of similar reactors.

There are several other factors contributing to the coefficient of reactivity.
The expansion of the lead in a partially filled reflector due to a rise in’
temperature will give an increase in reactivity. A simple calculation vas made
to determine the magnitude of this effect. It was assumed that the reflector
was & cylindrical shell 176 em high,

The change in the density of lead due to a temperature change was found
from Figure 5.1% to be .

- 0.00065 g/cm’/°F ,

Therefore, P= J? =0.00065 T
where T is the change in temperature from T,.

If the reflector is ome half full at 1200°F and the temperature is increased
so the reflector level will raise one cm, the weight of lead will remain con-
stant, so

2 Trx thd 2 = ar (Lhe ) d(r - 0.00065 T)

Rearranging, T = _ /%
’ 0. 000 65 (& hel)

£ = 10.22 g/em’ at 1200°F 2

so T = 177°F rise.

If the total reactivity of the reflector is 0,016, then the average re-
activity per cm of height is 0.9 x 1074 per cm, Therefore, a 177°F rise in
temperature will raise the reactivity 0.9 x 107%, The temperature coefficient

of reactivity due to the expansion of the lead reflector is then approximately

0.5 x 10° and is positive. This is considerably smaller then the lowest -
value of the negative coefficient used for expansion of the fused salt,

The Doppler effect is another source of variation of resctivity vith
temperature. The overall effect is to increase resonance cross sections with -
an increase of temperature. Thus, the fissions in Pu?3? will be increased

with increasing temperature, leading to a positive temperature coefficient of

bv

reactivity. This positive coefficient is in part balanced by the negative

coefficient of reactivity arising from the increased absorption in the Pu,
23 introduces a negative coefficient of reactivity so with the proper

balance of the two materials, the positive coefficient can be cancelled out.

It was found in a 233 system that to obtain a negative temperature coefficient
of reactivity, the ratio of U8 to U2” muclei would have to be greater then .
1.9. In the reactor belng studied, the ratio of U3 to Pu?39 1s 2.0. Although
no calculation was made for the Pu? system, 1% appears that if the temperature .
coefficient of reactivity due to the Doppler effect is still positive, it will
be small compared to that obtained from the density change in the fused salt,

5.4 REFLECTOR CONTROL

The lead reflector will be used primarily for shim control to compensate
fer burn-up of the fuel. This will allow the addition of fuel at fixed intervals
rather than continuously if concentration control were used. The operating
level of the lead reflector at the beginning of a burn up period will be at a
point where only 0,0025 of reactivity can be added by completely filling the | |
reflector. This will allow for about ten days of operation between additions |
of fuel,

The dumping of the lead reflector can be used for normal shut downs of | -
the reactor. However, the operating temperature of the fused salt must be
maintained during shut down either by decay heat or by the addition of external .
heat. This is to prevent the reactor from going eritioal due to the negative
temperature coefficient of reactivity if the temperature drops. The dumping | ~ |
of the fused salt will occur only as. an emergency screm or when the reactor oo
requires maintenance. Dumping of the lead reflector for shut down will reduce oo

greatly the consequent start up time.

5.5 SIMULATGR STUDIES

Simulator studies were run to determine the stability of the system under
changing load conditions. The load demand was varied from full load down to
1/6 load in steps of 1/6. The load was then taken back up to one half load
and then to full load. Even though the load changes were made much faster than
they could be changed in actual practice, the system proved to be very stable
under these conditions. This was because of the negative temperature coefficient
of reactivity and the large heat capacity of the system, The use of different
negative temperature coefficients of reactivity only changed the time with
which the system responded to the load changes,

Due to & lack of time, no method to hold the steam temperature at its
design point when the load was reduced was simulated. However, there are
several things that can be done, either wholly or in part, to maintain the steam
temperature. The temperature of the boiler feed water can be reduced by reducing
the amount of steam to the boiler feed water heaters or also the steam temperature
can be reduced by attemperation. The auxiliary cooling system could be used
to remove part of the heat. This design calls for constant speed pumps but if
variable speed pumps were available they could be used to regulate the steam
temperature. The temperature of the reactor could be varied by the reflector
shim control but there is a lover limit to prevent freezing of the fused salt.

The following diagram shows the design temperatures of the various loops

in the system at full load.

As seen in Fig, 5.2, the reactor power follows the load demand with

practically no overshoot with a negative temperature coefficient of reactivity

of 3.3 x 107%, There is no noticable change in the mean fuel temperature as

the load demand 1s varied.
5

A negative temperature coefficient of reactivity of 2.0 x 10° was used
to obtain the results shown in Fig. 5.4. Even with this small coefficient,

the reactor is stable but requires more time to reach equilibrium after a load

demand change.

Fig. 5.5 shows the different temperatures obtained in the system when
the load is varied. This is with no method of controlling the steam temperature
in the simulator circuit.

The diagram used to set up this reactor system on the simulater is shown
in Figs. 5.6 and 5,7.

5,6 STARTUP PROCEDURE

The following procedure is to be used when the core is empty and the re-
actor is to be started up. ]

1. Bring blanket up to operating temperature by adding heat through the blanket
heat exchanger. |

2. Heat fused salt to operating temperature in dump tanks.

3. With the lead reflector empty and the source in the blanket, begin pumping
the fused salt into the core, stopping at intervals to check criticality.
With the source in the blanket, the multiplication constant is not very
sensitive to the addition of fuel until the reactor becomes nearly critical.
At this point, more care must be exercised as criticality 1s approached.

The concentration of Pu must be such that when the core is completely filled
and at operating temperature, the multiplication constant is 0.95. The
pumping rate is 5 gpm which is adding reactivity at approximately 0,0001
per second. If a positive period is detected while filling the core, the
dump valve will be opened automatically. It is estimated that the solenoid
will operate in about 30 milliseconds and the core will empty in 4 seconds.

Le After the core is filled, finish filling the fused salt loop and start
the fuel circulating punp. Add heat through the main heat exchanger to
keep the fuel at operating temperature. |

5. Fill lead reflector to operating level, stopping at intervals to check
criticality.

6. Add Pu to bring reactor critical. This must be added in small amounts at
a point in the loop ahead of the heat exchanger to obtain maximum diffusion
in the salt before it enters the core. This dampens out the fluctuations |
of the multiplication constant which occur when the richer fuel enters the

~130-

a...

db

 
core. These fluctuations mist not be large enough to put the reactor on a
prompt criticel period. |

Te 1£ the mean témperature of the reactor is below the operating temperature
after it has gone critical, continue to add Pu until the reactor reaches
the operating tempersture. Then control the temperature level by reflector
shim during the burmup period.

 
 

 

CHA 6 CHEMICAL PROCESSING
6.1 FROCESS FLOW SHEETS
6.1.1 Core Processing

The core processing flow sheet 42? 43s 4b is shown in Fig. 6.1. Both
the core and blanket chemical treatments employ a Purex-type process as an
integral part of their processing cycles. Since standard Purex is a relatively

3H

well-developed operation, it will not be explained in detall and is shown as
a single block on the flow sheet.
The chemical process for the core is given in the following outline: ’
a. The fused salt is drained from the core. After ®cooling" at the re- .
actor site, it is transported to the processing plant.
b., The solidified salt mixture is then dissolved in water using heat if
required. Proper precautions are employed to maintain suberitical conditions.
c. Sodium hydroxide is introduced to precipitate the uranium, plutonium,
magnesium, and some fission products as hydroxides. After centrifugation, the .
the filtrate solution of sodium chloride and some fission-product chlorides
is discarded by approved waste-disposal techniques, provided the plutonium con-
tent is low enough. | |
d. The precipitate is dissolved in acidic solution buffered with emmonium
ion, -
e. Ammonium hydroxide is introduced to a pH of 5-6 to precipitate the ~
uranium, plutonium, end some remaining fission products as hydroxides. After
centrifugation, the filtrate solution containing most of the magnesium is again .
discarded, if the Pu content 1s acceptably low,
£. The precipitate is dissolved in nitric seid solution.

g. A modified Purex process is used to obtain decontaminated plutonium
nitrate, Details of some of the modification will be discussed in a later
section,

h, The plutonium is precipitated from nitrate solution with oxalic acid.

i. The plutonium oxalate is refluxed in hexachloropropene for 24-48 hours
at 224°C. Impure anhydrous plutonium trichloride (containing carbon) results,

J. The plutonium trichloride is chlorinated with phosgene for eight hours
at 600°C to remove impurities. The plutonium is then in a form which can be

returned to the reactor core.

6.1.2 Blanket Processing

The blanket process flow sheet 4 is shown in Fig. 6.2. The following
outline summarizes the chemical processing scheme for the blankets

a, The uranium dioxide-sodium paste is drained out of the blanket by use
of pressure and dilution with additional sodium, if needed.

b. After the paste is "cooled" at the reactor site and then transported
to the processing plant, the sodium is evaporated from the uranium dioxide and
is recovered for re-use..

¢. The uranium dioxide powder is contacted with ethyl alcohol to dissclve
the remaining sodium, This step may not be necessary, depending on the efficiency
of the previous step.

d. The powder is then dissolved in hot nitric scid.

e. The standard Purex process is employed to obtain decontaminated plut-
onium nitrate.

f. Steps h through J in the core processing outline are followed to ob-
tain plutonium in a form suitable for use in the core.

6.1.3 On-Site Fission-Product Removal

6.1.3.1 Of f=-Gas System

To make provision for the removal of fission-product gases, an
off-gas system must be included in the design of the reactor complex. In
addition, it is suspected that some chlorine gas may be given off from the core
material, although the amount will probably be small.

With the production of some chlorine assumed, the following outline
describes an off-gas system on the basis that some 9.4-year krypton will be
formed and that the reactor will not be located in a desolate region where dis-
persal techniques could be used.

a. The gases from the circulating fuel loop are removed through a vent
at the top of the inlet plenum to the primary heat exchanger. No compressor
is required, since the core system is under pressure.

b. After passing through a filter and a cooler to remove entrained particles
and vapor, the gases go through a let-down valve, The salt from the filter
and cooler is returned to the core system.

¢. The gases next pass through an aqueous or caustic scrubber and a silver
nitrate reactor to remove the chlorine.

d. The gases are dried at - 70°F to remove water vapor.

e. After passage through charcoal absorbent beds, all rare gases
ere retained in the charcoal, If a carrier gas such as helium or nitrogen were
introduced subsequent to the let-down valve, this gas would then pass through
a CWS filter or equivalent and finally out of a stack.

Periodically, the charcoal beds would have to be heated, and the rare
gases thus driven off would be stored in pressure eylinders. However, if the

-136~-

»

 
 

y

 

amount of 9.4-year krypton were sufficiently small, buried pipes containing
charcoal at ambient temperature could be substituted for the refrigerated char-
coal beds and would provide sufficient holdup to allow decay of the rare gases

before release to the atmosphere.

6.1.3.2 Precipitetion of Fission Products

After the reactor has been in operation for a time, it is possible
that certain fission products (presumably rare earths) will build wp to con-
centrations exceeding their solubilities in the fused chloride core mixture,
Thus, it is necessary to consider the removal of precipitating fission-product
chlorides. Lack of experimental data in this area requires qualitative treat-
ment of this problem,

Since fission~-product concentrations will be building up rather slowly,
it seems reasonable that they could be kept below their solubility limits by
contimious processing of a small glde-stream from the circulating fuel loop.
This stream would be tapped off from the hot stream leaving the reactor core
and then passed through & small large-tube vertical heat exchanger cooled by
an auxiliary sodium stream. The chloride nixture would then go to one of two
filters in parallel where precipitates would be removed. One filter would be
on-stream while the solid material was being removed from the other.

To insure effective removal of fission-product precipitates, it would be
necessary to cool the side stream to a temperature below the — in the
circulating fuel loop. In order to prevent introduction into the core of a
stream with cold spots, the side stream would be returned to the inlet plemm
of the main heat exchanger, allowing time for mixing.

-137-

 
 

 

 

6.1.3.3 Distillation Removal of Fission Products

The possibility arose of the continuous partial removal of low-
boiling fission-product chlorides from the core mixture by distillation of
a small side-stream, Again, lack of experimental data prevents quantitative
treatment of this problem, However, it is at least worthy of mention that it
might be possible to postpone for a long period of time the complete aqueous
processing of the core material by means of an on-site continuous distillation

~

process.

6.2 CONSIDERATIONS LEADING TO PROCESS SELECTION

6.2.1 Processes Considered

Any attempt to select a chemical processing treatment for a reactor
system as broadly defined initially as the one described in this report de-
perded upon the basic problems of core and blanket materials selection. Quite
naturally, every tentative choice of materials for either the core or the blanket
necessitated a preliminary investigation of the processing problems involved
in order to determine any excessive cost requirements or prohibitive operating
conditions,

Although the nature of the reactor studied dictated the general type of
material in the core, there was a considerable degree of latitude in choosing
the blanket material, as indicated previously in the report. Under consideration
vere urenium dioxide-sodium systems and canned solid uranium in addition to
fused uranium salts, Thus the chemical processes investigated included pyro-
metallurgical, volatilization, electrolytic, aqueous and other processes.

It became evident very early that any evaluation of most of the processes
considered would be hindered by two potent factors, viz., lack of experimental
data end non-existence of reliable cost data. Since the time to be spent on
chemical processing during the course of the project was limited, it was decided
that studies would be restricted to those processes on which sufficient experi-
mental and cost data were available to allow a realistic appraisal. Unfortunately,
this decision almost automatically eliminated everything except aqueous processing.

The above decision, however, was in line with the general project philo-
sophy that the reactor system designed would be one for which a capability of

construction might reasonably be expected to exist in the next couple of years.

-139=-
mm————

 
 

 

In addition, it was felt that with the low fission-product capture cross sections
in a fast reactor, it might be possible to process infrequently enough to make
aqueous processing economical by employing a centralized processing facility.

The vindication of this idea appears later. (See Section 6.3.1). Actually,

this approach should be conservative, since economics will undoubtedly dictate
that the construction of any type of processing facility have no higher costs

than those estimated at present for aqueous plants.
6.2.2 Process Selection

Among the aqueous processes, the Redox and Purex processes have been

most widely studied and are feasible for plant-scale construction. Data on
other aqueous processes are not widely available, and it seems unlikely that
much cost advantage could be obtained with any of them. Of the Redox and Purex
processes, the latter is more economical; and thus, it was selected as the basis
for chemical processing to separate uranium, plutonium, and fission products.

Before the choice of Purex could be finalized, however, several problems had
to be resolved. Since thinking was in terms of a centralized processing
facility, it was necessary to ascertain whether Purex could be adapted for use
with the core material in order to be able to employ the same basic process
for both core and blanket, This problem is discussed in Section 6.2.3. Further,
there remained the determination of economical head-end and tail-end treatments
suitable for the materials in the blanket and the core. Treatments vere fara

and are outlined on the flow sheets in Sections 6.1.1 and 6.1.2.

6.2.3 Purex Modifications for Core Processing

43

Information obtained on the Purex process ~ indicated that it would

be entirely feasible to adapt the process to handle feeds of high plutonium

=1/0-

 
 

 

 

o

content, However, several major problems were apparent immediately.

Processing of fuels with high plutonium content requires close control
of the Pu concentration to maintain subcriticality of all equipment. The high
concentration of fission products in the feed poses both chemical handling and
radiolytic reagent degradation problems, In the plutonium separation step,
the reductant (ferrous sulfamate) concentration must be stepped up to maintain
the increased amount of Pu in a chemically reduced state. This in turn leads
to a requirement for separating large quantities of ferric ion from plutonium.
The solution of these problems would require development work in the laboratory.

Much more dilute concentrations of uranium than in a standard Purex vai ld
have to be employed in order to maintain the low plutonium concentrations
necessary for suberiticality. Ome method for alleviation of this situation
which would bring the process closer to a standard Purex is to recycle uranium
from the uranium strip column. This uranium is in a dilute nitric acid solution
and could be used with additional nitric acid to dissolve the hydroxides from
the head-end treatment, yielding a solution closer ekin to the conventional
Purex feed with respect to uranium concentration. To improve this treatment,
a higher initial TBP concentration could be used in starting the Purex to pro~-
vide a higher uranium concentration in the strip solution and this latier solution
could be further concentrated by evaporation.

Longer fuel cooling times would lessen the decomposition of Purex reagents
by fission-product decay. The increased amount of ferric ion in the final
plutonium solution could be handled by increasing the ion exchange facilities

employed in the standard Purex process.

 
 

 

 

 

6.2. Alternate Blanket Process

In addition to other processes mentioned, there was another con~-
sidered which is worthy of mention in detail, since it seems to have escaped
mention in the literature and since it has quite interesting possibilities.

The process depends upon the fact that plutonium dioxide becomes refractory at
a much lower temperature (500-600 "C) than doesraniun dioxide (about 1100°C)
and most fission-product oxides and hence can be exceedingly difficult to
dissolve from an oxide mixture. As a result, if the proper dlssolution con-
ditions are used upon an oxide mixture in which only the plutonium dioxide 1s
refractory, the uranium dioxide and a good portion of the fission-product
oxides can be dissolved initially, The resulting matrix can then be dissolved
yielding a solution which contains mainly plutonium with some fission products.

Since no experimental data has been found on the decontamination obtain-
able, it is difficult to evaluate this process. However, it is interesting
to consider its use for fast reactor bred material, where very high decontam-
ination factors are not essential, due to low fission-product absorption cross
sections. One possible limitation of this treatment is that the concentration
of Pu0y in U0, must be high enough so that the Pu0, will exhibit its own pro-
perties,

A tentative outline for such a process 1s given as follows:

a. The sodium is removed from the uranium dioxide-sodium blanket material
by volatilization and alcohol dissolution as explained in Section 6.1.2.

b. An oxidation may be necessary to convert any plutonium metal to dioxide.

c. The oxide mixture is roasted at 500-600°C to meke the PuO, refractory.

Depending upon the blanket temperature, this may have already been accomplished

 
 

yr

during irradiation. On the other hand, too high a blanket temperature could
cause all oxides to become refractory, destroying the feasibility of this
process.

d. The wanium dioxide and most t1ssion-product oxldes ere dissolved out
of the mixture with hot concentrated nitric acid.

e, The remaining material, mainly Pu0y, is dissolved in nitric acid
containing fluoride (sbout 0.1% HF).

f. The plutonium is precipitated as oxalate and treated as described in
Section 6.1.1. .

6.3 PROCESSING CYCIE TIMES
6.3.1 General

Thus far, little mention has been made of the economic feasibility
of the chemical processes already described. Actually, preliminary cost estimates
were made before final process selection to insure that there would be no
economically unrealistic choice made, |

The determination of processing cycle times revolves largely, though not
entirely, about the question of economics. For this reason, the major part of
this section will be spent upon economics calculations. Although fission-pro-
duct buildup is not as hermful in a fast reactor as in a thermal reactor, this
problem affects the economy of breeding and will be treated.

Before specific discussion is begun, it should now be mentioned and em-

~ phasized that all process economics will be based on the use of a large cen-~

tralized chemical processing facility. Previous economic studiest® bear out
that the production of relatively cheap electric power requires the minimization
of fuel processing costs through the existence of a central processing plant
treating the fuel from a number of power reactors. Thus, it should be borne in
mind that all cost figures are based on the assumed availability of such a

processing plant.

6.3.2 Effect of Fission-Product and Transuranic Buildup

Although a study of the absorption cross sections of fission-product
elements at high neutron energies indicates that poisoning effects will be
small in a fast reactor, it is important to determine the magnitude of this
47

effect and its influence upon the core process cycle time. P. Greebler at

KAPL has computed an average fission-product cross section from estimated

“1/4

 
 

 

Lal

 

resonance parameter distribution for v3 5 fission in intermediate spectra.
From a plot of Greebler's results, average values of 2 0p for each group in
the final multi-group calculation were taken and averaged over the flux in

lethargy space as shown in Table 6.1.

To ‘achieve sufficient — to provide two £1ss1on-product atons for

| each plutonium atom In the core system would require about nine years of operation,

with 600 MW core heat production, & core system Pu inventory of 1810 kg, and an
80% load factor. If this situation existed, calculations indicate that the

mex imim possible fractional decrease in the external breeding ratio would be

-145-

 
 

 

2 Gp . 0.237 = 0.09
Gp (1 +X) 2.1 (140.26)
provided that sufficient additional plutonium is added to the core to maintain
a constant internal breeding ratio. Thus, with an initial external breeding
ratio of 0.852 and a constant internal breeding ratio, the decrease in the

external breeding ratio per year will be

0.090 x 0.852 = 0,0085 per year
9.0

No adjustment of this value will be made to account for removal of fission-
product gases, since this effect will only be about 10% and since there is
uncertainty in Greebler's values.

To account for transuranic buildup, it was decided to make an order-of-
magnitude correction only, due to limited time. Since it was felt that the
net effect of transuranic absorption and fission would be of the same order-
of-magnitude as the absorption in the fission products, the value for the de-
crease in external breeding ratio per year due to fission products was doubled
to include the transuranic effect. Thus, the figure for the over-all decrease
in external breeding ratio will be

2 x 0,0085 = 0,017 per year
6.3.3 Economics and Process Cycle Time Selection

Regarding the reactor site stockpile for replacement of fuel burnup losses,
it was decided to commence each quarter of the year with & three-month supply

end to allow this quantity to dwindle essentially to zero before replacement

- at the start of the following quarter.

6.3.3.2 Core Processing
To determine the optimum core processing cycle time, an economic

balance was made between processing cost and loss in breeding credit due to

146

 
 

 

L}

al

 

fission-product and transuranic buildup. Neglected was the increased pluton-
ium inventory cost with time due to the extra amount required to maintein cri-
ticallty as poisons build up. Preliminary calculations indicated that this
was a negligible factor. Changes in inventory cost due to changes in cooling
{time with varying process cycle time were also neglected.

Since the amount of uranium and plutonium in the core material remains
essentially constant with time, the weight of these materials ir the core system
is

3605 kg of U + 1810 kg. of Pu = 5415 kg U and Pu.

At a cost of $62 per kg. for head-end and Purex treatment, the cost for this
part of one core processing is
5415 kg x $62/kg = $335,700. |

With a cost of $2000 per kg of plutonium for conversion of Purex plutonium
nitrate to plutonium trichloride, the cost for this part of one core processing
is

1810 kg x $2000/kg = $3,620,000.
Thus, the total cost for ome core processing at any time is

£335,700 + $3,620,000 = $3,955,700.
On a basis of one year, the processing cost per year is

$3,955,700
y

where y is the number of years in the core processing cycle time,

‘Each time the core is processed, the diluent salts and the uranium
trichloride must either be replaced or recovered. Since the cost involved is
quite small, it will be computed on the basis that the salts will be replaced
after each core processing. Cost figures obtained for sodium chloride, magnesium

50

chloride and uranium trichloride are 12¢ per 1b”, 15¢ per °°, and $10 per keg ol.

Using these mmbers, the cost of the core material (not including plutonium

-147-

 
 

 

trichloride) is $1.73 per 1b of salt mixture. Thus, the cost for one replace-
ment of this mixture is
31,770 1b. x $1.73/1b = $54,900

The cost for salt replacement per year is then

$54,900
y

From the calculation in Section 6.3.2, the external breeding ratio de-
creases by 0.017 per year. With an 80% load factor and anc of 0.26, the re-

actor consumes 217.7 kg. of plutonium per year, using the conversion factor
that 1.0 gm. Pu fissioned = 1 MWD. With a total breeding ratio of 1.09, the
average breeding credit per year is |

| 217.7 x lo-09 - 0.5 (0.017) y] x $15,000
where again y is the number of years in the core processing cycle time and
where the excess bred plutonium is sold back to the AEC for $15 per gram. The

results of selecting different values for y are shown in Table 6.2.

The results of the cost analysis show that it would be most economical
to process the core about once every 10 years or so. However, the core vessel
will be replaced every five years, entailing a long reactor shut-down period.
Thus, it was decided to process the core material during this period and avoid

extre inventory charges during cooling-down shipping and processing.

6.3.3.3 Blanket Processing

To select the economically optimum blanket processing cycle
time, a balance was made between processing cost and the inventory charge on
the plutonium replacing that burned during reactor operation, It is assumed
that the internal breeding ratio will be maintained constant at 0.238 and that

~ the external breeding ratio will decrease with time from its initial value

of 0,807.

With a total burnup of plutonium in the core of 217.7 kg, per year and
an internal breeding ratio of 0.238, the net amount of plutonium to be replaced
is

0.762 x 217.7 kg = 165.9 kg Pu/year
again neglecting the extra amount of plutonium which must be added to counter-
act the increase in poisoning with time, If an inventory of enough Pu for
three-months burnup is acquired at the beginning of each quarter, the initial
stockpile every quarter will be

165.9 x 0.25 = 41.5 kg Pu stockpile.

The average amount of plutonium inventory carried due to replacement of
burned Pu is then

41.5 x [o.5 (Zh 0-5] kg Pu

where Z is the number of months in the blanket processing cycle time. The
plutonium inventory cost per kg per year is 4% of $15,000. Thus, the total

=149-
—

 
 

 

Pu inventory cost due to burnup replacement is

0.04 x $15,000 x 41.5 x = (2+05].

Since the blanket contains 15,000 kg of uranium, the blanket processing
cost per processing for the head-end and Purex treatments will be

15,000 kg U x $31/kg = $465,000 | |
since the amount of uranium in the blanket remains essentially constant with
time, Per year, this cost is

$465,000 x 12
Z

In addition, the charge per year for processing the blanket plutonium from
Purex plutonium nitrate to plutonium trichloride will be
217.7 kg x [0-022 - 0.5(0.017) _Z_ | x $2000/kg.
12

The total processing cost will be sum of the two above costs. The economic
balance as & function of time between blanket processing cost and plutonium

burnup inventory cost is shown in Table 6.3.

The results show that the economically optimum blanket processing cycle
time is about three or four years. However, as there 1s uncertainty as to
the corrosion effect that formation of Na,,0 in the blanket will have, a shorter
cycle time is desirable, Thus, a blanket processing cycle time of two years

will be selected, since the increase in cost is only about 0.02 mil per kwhr.

CHAPTER SHIELD IN

7.1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The shielding of the reactor will consist of steel and standard concrete.

In general, component shielding will be omitted; instead a compartmental shield

will be used for the entire reactor cell room. This philosophy of shielding |

was adopted in order to facilitate maintenance and replacement of equipment.
Since the entire reactor cell room will be underground (Fig. 3.3), the

surrounding earth will provide additional shielding, however this will not

be taken into account in the calculations. The ceiling or top of the reactor

cell room will have a shield 1.75 feet thick made of steel. The sides of the

cell will have a thermal shield consisting of 4 inches of steel and a biological

shield of 6 feet of ordinary concrete. The thermal shield will be made of

3 7/8 inches of carbon steel and 1/8 inch of stainless cladding on all sur-

faces which will require decontamination. Cooling of the thermal shield was

not designed. However, it presents no problem, either air or water cooling

may be used. The thermal shield structure will also provide the foundation

for the steel contairment vessel over the reactor plant. The biological shield

will be made of ordinary concrete; all special concretes were rejected due to

52
their high costs.

7.2 REACTOR SHIELDING CATCULATIONS

7.2.1 Neutron Shielding

The results of the Univac ezleuletions were utilized in determining

the neutron loskage flux to be attenuated. Only the first four energy groups

are of any concern with respect. to shielding. Below are tabulated the energy

groups and the neutron leakage.

Table 7.1

04 0.50-0,18 20.7 x 108

5 2
The leakage surface area of the reactor is 2.3 x 10 em . This results

in a leakage flux of 1.0 x 10%, 2.1 x 10%, 9.5 x 10°, and 12.6 x 10°

neutrons
per en per sec for energy groups Ol, 02, 03 and 04 respectively. This leak-
age flux is extremely small, hence the gamma rays will be the determining

factor in the design of the shield.

7.2.2 Gamma Ray Shielding

Four major sources of gamma rays exist in this reactor configuration.

These sources of radiation are the prompt fission gemmas, fission product gammas,

— and inelastic scattering gammas.

The number and energy spectrum of the prompt fission gammas per fission
is given in TID - 7004. By using the following equation, the mmber of gammas
in this reactor system is determined:

=154=

 
 

“ut

I

Noy= 31x10 (EB) P(r)

The power density P(r), was taken as 167 watts per c.c. the average power density
in the core.

During operation, gemmas are given off by the fission products. The number
and energy spectrum per fission is given in TID - 7004. Again the ——
power density of 167 watts/c.c. was used.

Ganmas are produced due to captures in the core vessel and the lead re~
flector. The core vessel was assumed to be steel. Using the average thermal
flux in the core vessel as given by the Univac results, the cross-section for
capture and the photons of various energies produced by captures, the mmber
of gemmas produced was calculated, Using the seme technique, the same was done
for the leed reflector.

Inelastic scattering gammas are produced in the core vessel, lead reflector,
end in the blanket. Since the high energy gammas are the most difficult to
shield, inelastic scatterings of only the two highest neutron energy groups
were calculated. A major assumption was made concerning the energy of the
gamma produced. Since very meager information exists as to the mmber and
energy of inelastic scattering gammas, it was assumed that the Ol neutron energy
group produced a single 10 Mev gamma and the 02 group, a single 2,2 Mev gemma.
It is realized that this is a conservative sssumption.

.The energy spectrum of all ganas produced will be approximated by four
energy. groups; 2.0, 5.0, 7.0 and 10.0 Mev, . The photons produced of energy less
than 1.5 Mev were neglected; all others were averaged into the groups above,

A further approximation is that the source of gammas other than core ¥§'s, will

be taken as located at the outer surface of the lead reflector. The core was

assumed to have self absorption and some attenuation is produced. Below are

Since the 7.0 Mev gammas were much smaller in number than those of other

The gammas are attenuated through the blanket of uo, and Na, the carbon
moderator and reflector, the air(which was neglected), and the shield of steel
end concrete. The spherical source was converted to a monodirectional infinite
plane source and the attenuation calculations were performed using the appro-
priate equations. For a detailed analysis of the shielding calculations, see
Appendix B.

“It was found that 4 inches of steel and 6 feet of ordinary concrete or
in the case of the top shield, the 1.75 feet of steel results in a radiation
dose less then the maximum permissable dose of 50 mr/hr. This dose of 50 mr/hr
was taken as the maximum permissable dose since no one will be required to
spend more than 2 hours per week in a redietion area. This would give the per-
son a total weekly dose of sbout 100 mr/week which is one-third the maximum

pernissable dose designated by the Atomic Energy Commission.

 
 

 

 

CHAPTER & ECONOMICS
8.1 GENERAL

The resctor power cost of 6.5 mills/kwhr as presented below, compares
favorably with conventional power cost. It must be realized however that, in
spite of efforts to be on the conservative side, there are a mumber of un-
certainties which when resolved might substantially change the total cost of
reactor power.

. A considerable uncertainty exists regarding reliability. The design is
basically simple, but the high negative coefficient of reactivity combined
with large temperature fluctuations could result in frequent dumping of the
core.

The fuel and blanket processing costs were based on a large projected

centralized chemical plant and might be revised upwards in ectual experience.

The cost of operation and maintenance are arbitrarily arrived at since

no experience is available. (See reference 56 and 57.)

CHAPTER 9, RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE WORK
9.1 GENERAL

In order to determine better the technical and economic feasibility of
a fused-salt fast power reactor system, an extensive program of research and
development would be necessary. The following sections suggest areas in which
important contributions can be made toward the advancement of the fused-salt
reactor technology.

It is realized that significant technical efforts in certain study areas
mentioned may currently be in progress. However, lack of knowledge of this

work prevents inclusion here.

~164-

9.2 ENGINEERING

To increase the feasibility of a fused-salt reactor for power production,
development progrems should be conducted to perfect valves and variable capacity
pumps for use in circulating fuel heat exchange loops. To improve the basis
for the use of once-through boilers, it would be most helpful to have better
data for the prediction of pressure drops and heat transfer coefficients for
two-phase aqueous flow in such bollers.

To treat the problem of heating in a volume which has gamma-rays being
produced in it and is exposed to a gamma-ray source, better analytical methods
correlated with experimental data are required.

Further information is needed on the feasibility of making the blanket
paste of sodium and uranium dioxide or other high solid content slurries.
Additional data on concentrations obtainable would also be desirable, as waald
information on the characteristics of equipment used to achieve such high con-

centration.

-165-

 
 

9.3 MATERIALS

Progress in the fused-salt technology necessitates extensive experimental
work on salt systems. Fhase diagrams for ternary and quaternary chloride
systems containing fuel are almost non-existent and are badly needed. Like-
wise specific heats, viscosities, thermal conductivities and other physical
properties of fused-salt mixtures are required to analyze possible reactor
systems,

Information on the physical properties of high density oxide slurries

in sodium should be obtained. The corrosion ceused by the presence of Na, 0

in such a slurry should be investigated, as should possible remedial techniques

such as addition of anti-oxidants.

Both static and dynamic corrosion-rate data on fused salts in various
structural materiels, especially the new nickel-molybdenum alloys, should be
taken in the temperature range from 900-1500°F . The effects of mass transfer
in heat exchange loops made of these materials should be assessed experimen-

tally with long-time tests. Scale coefficients of fused salts in different

materials need to be determined,

9.4 CHEMICAL PROCESSING

To eliminate or reduce the requirement for aqueous processing, it would
be advantageous to investigate the continuous or semicontinuous removal of
volatile fission-products chlorides by distillation from fused chloride mix=-
tures containing uranium trichloride. It might also be worthwhile to consider
the oxidation of C1, and PuCl, to uel, and PC, to effect a gross separation
of fuel and fertile material from fission-product and diluent chlorides by
distillation of the more volatile tetrachlorides.

In the case of fused salt mixtures irradiated to 50 or 100% fuel burnup,
studies should be made to ascertain the effects of high fission-product con-
centrations on mixture properties. Although precipitation and deposition
might occur, this might possibly be employed as a method for removing insoluble
fission-product chlorides from a side-stream which is cooled and filtered.

Experimental work should be done on the aqueous processing of fuels con-
taining high concentrations of fission products and plutonium. Recycle of
a diluent uranium stream to simplify the chemical and criticality problems
involved should be investigated. |

9.5 REACTCR CONTROL

Further calculations of the Doppler effect should be carried out to
determine whether it is positive or negative, A detailed study of possible
reactor accidents should be made in order to define better the control problems

involved in the operation of a fused-salt fast power reactor.

-167~

 
 

 

 

9.6 ECONOMICS

Many of the cost figures used in making the economic studies in this re-

port are based on the arbitrarily standardized numbers. In addition, other

. figures have been assumed with rather weak bases, due to the lack of good cost

information. Thus, further information developed in the future or new AEC

“decisions may change any or all of the cost figures.

In order to determine the feasibility of a fused-salt reactor system which
will be constructed and operated at some time in the future, it will be nec-
essary to make more valld economic projections in time if any truly realistic
cost study is to be made. The ability to do this will depend largely upon
changes in the amount of government regulation in the reactor field, which

are difficult to predict.

APPENDIX A.7 CORE VESSEL AND REFLECTOR HEATING

Gamma Sources and Heating

/

The gamma sources were estimated by methods given in the Reactor Shielding

(20)

Handbook. The prompt gammas were estimated using the equation:

Sv (Photons) = 3.1 x 1010 N(E) P (r)
(em3sec )

N(E) = Photon/fission of energy E (20)

P(r) = Power density (watts)
cm
The power density was assumed constant and equal to the average of 167 watts/
en? for temperature rise calculations.

The decay product gammas were estimated assuming an infinite operating
time and the averaged power density. This gamma spectrum was also found in
the Reactor Shielding Handbook. 20)

These two sources yielded a volume source of gammes of 77.6 x 1012

hotons, of average energy 1.33 Msv, having the energy spectrum as shown in
cm3sec
Figure 3.17.

The gamma heating in the core vessel and lead reflector due to this source

was estimated using the Integral Beam, Straight Ahead Approximation. (15) This

approximation yields the equation:

gamma contribution to the heat generation was estimated. This heat generation

rate is shown eas a function of distance through core vessel and lead reflector

in Figure 3.20. The averaged gemma heat generation rate was found to be 3.29 x 103

Neutron Sources end Heating
The neutron sources were taken to be the averaged integral fluxes
in & specific energy group, es given by the Unive calculations, over the ‘core
vessel end the leed reflector. Using these averaged fluxes the average heat
generation rate vas then calculated for the specific neutron Jnteractions of
elastic scatter, capture, end inelastic scatter. The gamma source due to

neutron capture and inelastic scattering has been neglected.

Temperature Rise in the Core Vessel

For reasons of simplicity in calculation the heat generation rates

in the core vessel and in the lead reflector were assumed to be constants and

the geometry was taken as a slab.

The worst condition was assumed to be that at which the temperature in

the core and the blanket were equal. With this in mind the boundary conditions

were:
(1) et x=-0,T;=0
(2) at x=1b, T, = 0
(3) atx=-2,T) = T,

and the lead reflector of 3.68 cal and 0.676 cal respectively, the

on? sec ed sec

thermal conductivities and thicknesses of the core vessel and lead, the equations

reduce to:

T. = 9%.6 x ~ 36.8 Zz

1
T, = 46.9+22.4 x = 9.15 x
(T = o%)

These equations yield a maximum temperature of 109,3%F at a distance of 1.286
cm into the core vessel.

Since it is believed that a temperature rise this great would cause unduly
large thermal stresses in the core vessel it was thought that cooling of the
lead reflector would alleviate this.

Using the previously derived equations for temperature in the core vessel
and the lead reflector and assuming that the heat removal rate from the re-
flector could be assumed constant across the reflector and that the interface
temperature was equel to that in the core and blanket, a temperature distribution

could be calculated, Thus these equations are:
T, (x) = 48.9 x - 36.8%
T, (x) = 25.8 x° = 131.5% +126.9
We found that the total heat removal rate was required to be 2.586 cal/om’ sec.

The maximum temperature in the core vessel had now been reduced to 29,2°F, Tt

was determined that this caused negligible thermal stresses.

APPENDIX C
EXPERIMENTAL TESTS
C.l1 Summary of Melting Point Tests

Since there was no available data on the melting points of the proposed
ternary chloride compositions a series of tests were underteken to provide some
fragmentary data. |

The tests were run in the standard apparatus. This consisted of a nickel
crucible in which the salt was placed, a nickel container (which was provided
with openings for a stirrer, thermocouple, and a dry gas atmosphere) into which
the crucible was sealed, All operations were done in a dry box,

Since there was some doubt that the MgCl, vas anhydrous it was purified
by the addition of some NH, Cl and heated to its melting point. This succeeded
in removing the water of hydration from the MgCl, without the conversion of the
MgCl, to MgO, This was determined by a petrographic anelysis,

The NaCl, was then mixed to the eutectic composition (60% mol NaCl) and

2
melted as a check on the accuracy of the equipment. The melting point was found

to be 137°C as compared with 450°C, the literature value,
Using the above outlined procedure melting points vere then determined of
three salt mixtures having (1) 38.6% Mg Cl,, 57.91% NaCl, 3.49% UC1 3 (2)
36.36% MgCl,, 54.54% NaCl, 9.09% UClys (3) 33.33% MgCly, 50.01% NaCl, 16.66% UCL 5°

C.2 Petrographic Analysis of Salt Mixtures

Petrographic analysis of the salt mixtures were done by Dr. T. N. McVey
at the Y-12 plant. These enalyses are given below:
Sample one: Eutectic of MgCl,-NaCl (40-60 mol %)
Main phase well crystallized. One p above 1.620 and the other below.

There is microcrystalline material present and this has a generel in-
dex of refraction below 1.544 (NaCl), This suggests hydration. X-rays
show neither MgCl, or FeCl. |

Semple twos (36.4% MgCl,, 51.5% NaCl, 9.1% UC1,)
Sample has colorless phase with brown crystals in it. Brown phase

“has p about 1,90, UCl, is higher at about 2.04. All phases are

3
microcrystalline, Sample oxidizes in air and is hygroscopic.

Sample three: (38.6% MgCl,, 57.9% NaCl, 3.5% UCl,)
Sample has brown compound noted above, Very small lath crystals of
a brown phase are present. The sample oxidizes and is hygroscopic.

Conclusion: More Data required to properly identify phases.

These analyses show that for the ¥MgCl,-NaCl eutectic neither the NaCl aor
the MgCl, exists as such. This is to be expected since the phase diagram shows
compound formation on each side of the eutectic. The compounds formed were
assumed to be the expected ones since there was no means of making the complete
identification.

Both samples containing the eutectic mixture plus U1, also shoved compound
formation. This was assumed since none of the original salts were recognized,
The salt mixtures were also checked for the presence of uel, . This was not found
present as such, }

C.3 Summary of Chemical Analysis of Ucl,

On a wt.% basis 68,8% of the UCL, should be U*’, The chemical analysis

3

of the UCl, used for our tests showed the 57.1% of the UCl, was o*3, This

3 3
indicates that the remainder of the U was in the tetravalent state.

C..4 Corrosion Tests

A series of 500 hour, see-saw capsule tests containing the chloride mixture
of 33.33% MgCl,, 50.01% NaCl, and 16,67% UCL, were initiated. The tests ave
being run in capsules of nickel, and of inconel, The results of these tests
are not yet available, but are expected by September 1, 1956.

As an adjunct of this test the chloride salt mixture will be chemically

analyzed as a further check on the exact composition.
