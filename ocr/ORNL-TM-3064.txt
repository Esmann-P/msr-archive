INFLUENCE OF TITANIUM, ZIRCONIUM, AND HAFNIUM ADDITIONS ON THE
RESISTANCE OF MODIFIED HASTELLOY N TO IRRADIATION DAMAGE
AT HIGH TEMPERATURE — PHASE I

H. E. McCoy, Jr.

ABSTRACT

The influence of small additions of Ti, Zr, and Hf on
the mechanical properties of a modified Hastelloy N with the
nominal composition Ni-12% Mo—7% Cr—0.2% Mn—0.05% C is
described in this report. It deals specifically with test
results from numerous, small, laboratory melts and several
100-1b melts from commercial vendors. Additions of Ti, Zr,
and Hf had beneficial effects on the properties of the alloy
both unirradiated and after irradiation. Irradiation temper-
ature had a marked effect upon the properties of all alloys
investigated. Generally, good properties were observed when
the irradiation temperature was 650°C or less and poor when
the temperature was 700°C or higher. We attributed this
large effect of irradiation temperature to coarsening of the
carbide structure at the higher temperature.

 

INTRODUCTION

Previous studies!™ showed Hastelloy N (Ni-16% Mo—7% Cr—4% Fe-0.05% C)
susceptible to a type of damage produced by irradiation at high tempera-
tures that results in reduced stress-rupture properties and fracture duc-
tility. One approach to solving this problem is that of making slight
changes in the chemistry of the alloy. We initially modified the base
composition to Ni-12% Mo—7% Cr—0.2% Mn—0.05% C to obtain an alloy that

was free of the stringers of the MgC type of carbide (where M is the
metallic component) characteristically found in standard Hastelloy N.
We then made a number of laboratory melts with various additions of Ti,
Zr, and Hf, since they form very strong, stable diborides® and should
tie up the boron as compounds rather than allow it to segregate to the
grain boundaries. The more random distribution of the boron should
reduce the radiation damage by reducing the concentration at grain
boundaries of helium produced by the 1°B(n,a) reaction.

The results of tensile and creep tests on these experimental alloys
show that the resistance to irradiation damage is improved by the addi-
tion of Ti, 2r, or Hf. Results of tests on the first small (100-1b) heats
of commercial alloys that contained these same alloy additions also indi-
cate improved properties.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
Test Materials

Our alloys were nonconsumably arc melted in an argon atmosphere
from melting stock of commercial purity. A starting charge of about
2 1b was consolidated and melted several times. The charge was then
placed in another arc-melting furnace with a hearth for drop casting.

The alloy was again melted and drop cast into a l-in.-diam X 6-in.-long
ingot. The ingot was swaged to 1/4-in.-diam rod by the following sched-
ule: from 1 in. to 3/4 in. at 1177°C, from 3/4 in. to 7/16 in. at 871°C,
and from 7/16 in. to 1/4 in. at ambient temperature.

The commercial melts were melted by vacuum induction and cast into
six 4-in.-diam ingots that weighed about 16 1b each. They were initially
forged at 1177°C; the final working was done at room temperature. The
final product was small 1/2-in.-thick plates with 40% cold work.

The chemical analysis of each alloy used in this study is given in
Table 1.

The rods were fabricated into the test specimens shown in Fig. 1.
Our work with this specimen has shown that the rest results are reproduc-
ible and agree quite well with those obtained for more massive specimens.
However, there is sufficient stress concentration to cause some of the

more brittle specimens to break in the radius at the end of the gage

length.

Irradiation Conditions

The results presented here were obtained from specimens irradiated
in several experiments. These experiments were carried out in three
reactors: the Engineering Test Reactor (ETR) at Idaho Falls, Idaho,

and the Oak Ridge Research Reactor (ORR) and Molten Salt Reactor Experi-
ment (MSRE) at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. A core facility was used in the
ETR where the thermal and fast (> 1 Mev) fluxes were each 3.2 x 1014
neutrons cm~2? sec”! and the fluence was 6 X 102° neutrons/cm?. The ETR
experiments were uninstrumented, and the design temperatures were either
below 150°C or 600 + 100°C. Melt wires included in these experiments
indicated that the operating temperatures were within the desired range.
The experiments in the ORR were performed in a poolside facility where
the peak fluxes were 6 X 103 neutrons cm? sec”! (thermal) and

5 x 1012 neutrons cm? sec”! (> 2.9 Mev). The experiments were run for
9

ge

@

either one or two cycles so that the thermal fluence was 2 to 5 X 1020
neutrons/cm? and the fast fluence was 2 to 4 X 101° neutrons/cm®. These
experiments were instrumented, and the temperatures were controlled at
650 to 871°C. The experiments in the MSRE were run in the center of the

2 sec”! and the

core, where the thermal flux was 4.1 xX 102 neutrons cm”
fast (> 1.22 Mev) flux was 1.0 Xx 102 neutrons cm™? sec”. The samples
were exposed to a noncorrosive fluoride salt environment for 4800 hr at
645 + 10°C and received a thermal fluence of 1.3 x 1020 neutrons/cm® and
a fast fluence of 3.1 X 10% neutrons/cm?. Since we could not see any
consistent effects of thermal-neutron fluence over the small range
encountered in these experiments, we present our data in this paper as

having been obtained at a common fluence.

Testing Procedure

The creep-rupture tests after irradiation were run in lever-arm
creep machines in the hot cells at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
The strain was measured by an extensometer with rods attached to the
upper and lower specimen grips. The relative movement of these two rods
was measured by a linear differential transformer, and the transformer
signal was recorded. The accuracy of the strain measurements is about
+0.1%, considering the effects of ambient temperature variations in the
hot cell, mechanical vibrations, etc. This accuracy is considerably
better than the specimen-to-specimen reproducibility that one would
expect for this alloy. The systems for measuring and controlling temper-
ature combine to give a temperature uncertainty of about +19,

The tensile tests were run on Instron Universal Testing Machines.

The strain measurements were taken from the crosshead travel.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
“Alloys Containing Titanium

‘The alloys with additions of titanium fell into three groups. The
first group, alloys 100 through 107, contained from less than 0.01 to
 

 

 

1.04% Ti. These alloys were of the nominal base composition of Ni~12% Mo—
7% Cr—0.2% Mn—0.05% C. Typical microstructures of these alloys after a
1-hr anneal at 1177°C are shown in Fig. 2. The alloys were all free of
intermetallic precipitates and contained only a small amount of carbide
precipitates. Generally, the amount of carbide increased and the

grain size decreased with increasing titanium concentration. The second
group, alloys 75 and 76, contained 1% Ti and were made to explore the
influence of varying carbon content. Typical microstructures of these
alloys are shown in Fig. 3. The third material, a 100-1b commercial
alloy from Special Metals Corporation, designated heat 21545, contained
0.49% Ti. Typical microstructures of this alloy are shown in Fig. 4.
This alloy had a nominal composition quite close to that of alloy 104,
and the microstructures of the two alloys after a l-hr anneal at 1177°C
were quite similar except that the commercial alloy contained patches of
precipitate. Close examination showed these regions to be quite high in
molybdenum. Some of the precipitates were carbides of the MC type and
others were almost pure molybdenum. The grain size after annealing for
100 hr at 871°C was quite fine, and copious quantities of carbide pre-
cipitates were present.

Alloys 100 through 107 were tested under a variety of conditions.
Tensile tests were run at 650°C on samples that had been annealed 1 hr
at 1177°C and aged 1000 hr at 650°C to duplicate the thermal history of
irradiated samples. The results of these tests are summarized in
Table 2. The variation of the tensile and yield strengths with titanium
content is shown in Fig. 5. The yield strength increased with increasing
titanium. The tensile strength varied in a poorly defined manner: at
a strain rate of 0.05 min~!, it increased systematically with increasing

titanium, and at a rate of 0.002 min~! it reached a maximum at 0.55% Ti.
The variation of the fracture strain with titanium content is shown in
Fig. 6. At a strain rate of 0.05 min~!, the addition of 0.11% Ti greatly
increased the fracture strain; further additions decreased the fracture
strain. At a strain rate of 0.002 min~!, the fracture strain improved
greatly with the addition of 0.11% Ti, and further additions caused a

gradual improvement.

Alloys 100 through 107 were irradiated at 650°C to a thermal fluence
of 2.5 X 102° peutrons/cm?. The results of tensile tests at 650°C after
irradiation are summarized in Table 3. The fracture strains measured at
650°C are plotted as a function of titanium content in Fig. 7. The data

exhibit considerable variation, but show no systematic variation with

“titanium concentration. The results of these tests are analyzed further

in Fig. 8, where the ratios of the various tensile properties of the irra-
diated and unirradiated alloys are compared. The yield stress is increased
by irradiation, and the tensile stress and fracture strain are decreased.
However, the ratios are only moderately dependent upon the titanium level.

Another set of samples of alloys 100 through 107 was irradiated at
50°C to a thermal fluence of 9 Xx 101° neutrons/cm?. The results of ten-
sile tests of these samples at 650 and 760°C are given in Table 4. Com-
parison of these results with those in Table 3 for the samples irradiated
to a higher fluence at a higher temperature reveals that the fracture

strains are higher for the samples irradiated at 50°C. The fracture

strains measured at 650°C after irradiation ranged from 22 to 26% but
did not vary systematically with titanium content. However, at a test
temperature of 760°C, the fracture strain did show a slight dependence
on titanium level; it varied from 9.5% with no titanium present to 13.2%
with 1.04% Ti present.

Several unirradiated samples of alloys 100 through 107 were creep
tested at 650°C. The results of these tests are summarized in Table 5
and plotted in Figs. 9 through 11. The results of stress-rupture tests
in Fig. 9 show a marked improvement in rupture life at a given stress
level with increasing titanium content. The results are somewhat
scattered, and there are some questions about the exact location of the
line for each heat. The measurements of minimum creep rate in Fig. 10
show that titanium decreased the creep rate. All of these tests were
run without an extensometer, and the precision of the measurements was
not very good. However, the data indicate that the creep rate did not
vary appreciably with titanium content from 0.11 to 1.04% Ti (alloys 101
and 107). The data also indicate that titanium concentration may have
no influence on the creep rate at low stress levels. The fracture strains
are shown in Fig. 11 as a function of the minimum creep rate. Titanium
additions definitely improve the fracture strain. The fracture strains
of alloys 106 and 107, which contained 0.81 and 1.04% Ti, respectively,
were almost independent of creep rate; the other alloys exhibited
decreasing fracture strain with decreasing creep rate.

Several of these alloys were heat treated to simulate irradiated
samples by anneals of 1 hr at 1177°C and 1000 hr at 650°C. The results
of tests on these samples are summarized in Table 6. A comparison of
these results with those in Figs. 9 through 11 for samples that were
annealed 1 hr at 1177°C indicates how these alloys respond to aging. The
rupture life, minimum creep rate, and fracture strain were all increased
by this aging treatment.

Alloys 100 through 107 were irradiated at 650°C and creep tested
at the same temperature after irradiation. The results of these tests
are given in Table 7. All of these samples were tested at a stress level
of 32,400 psi. The rupture lives and fracture strains are shown as func-

tions of titanium content in Fig. 12. The rupture life was increased

by a factor of 25 and the fracture strain by a factor of 10 by the addi-
tion of 1.04% Ti. These results are compared with those of the unirra-
diated control samples in Table 8. This comparison is fraught with the
uncertainties footnoted in Table 8, but it indicates that irradiated
samples containing 0.55% Ti or more have rupture lives that are about
0.7 times the unirradiated value, minimum creep rates that are about
equal to that of the unirradiated material, and fracture strains that
are about 0.7 times the unirradiated value.

Alloys 100 through 107 were also irradiated at 50°C to a thermal
fluence of 9 x 101° neutrons/cm? and creep-rupture tested. The results
of these tests are given in Table 9. These samples were tested at dif-
ferent stress levels than those used in the experiment described pre-
viously (Table 7). However, a rough comparison shows that the different
irradiation temperatures (650 vs 50°C) and the different fluences (25 vs
9 x 101° neutrons /cm?) had little effect on the test results. Both
experiments show clearly the increasing rupture life and fracture strain
with increasing titanium level.

The combined results of the tensile and creep tests allow a deter-

mination of the variation of the fracture strain with strain rate at 650°C

The date for samples irradiated at 650°C to a fluence of 2.5 x 102C
neutrons /cm? were used to construct Fig. 13. The strain rate is a con-
trolled parameter in a tensile test and was used directly in this figure.
The stress is controlled in a creep test, and the resulting minimum
creep rate was used in Fig. 13. The lines on this graph simply join the
data points, and their slopes have little significance. The most impor-
tant observation is that the addition of titanium causes a greater
improvement in the fracture strain at low strain rates than at high
strain rates.

The results presented thus far for alloys 100 through 107 were
obtained at a test temperature of 650°C for samples that were irradiated
at 650°C or lower. The results in Table 10 illustrate the effects of
varying the temperatures at which specimens were irradiated and tested.
One group of samples was irradiated and tested at 760°C. These results
show a general improvement in properties with increasing titanium level.
The stress-rupture results for this series of tests are compared in
Fig. 14 with those for tests on samples irradiated and tested at 650°C.
Several samples were irradiated at 50°C and tested at 760°C. These were

tested under different conditions, but the trend of increasing rupture

life and elongation is the same as for samples irradiated at 760°C. The
only property that seems appreciably different is the fracture strain:
higher values were obtained for samples irradiated at 50°C. The most
dramatic effect of irradiation temperature is demonstrated by the com-
bination of irradiation at 760°C and testing at 650°C (compare the
results in Tables 7 and 10). The general effect is that the higher irra-
diation temperature results in a shorter rupture life, a higher minimum
creep rate, and a lower fracture strain. For example, alloy 107 was
irradiated at 650°C and tested at 32,400 psi and 650°C. The rupture life
was 2928.8 hr, the minimm creep rate was 0.0026%/hr, and the fracture
strain was 12.8%. The same alloy irradiated at 760°C and tested at
30,000 psi and 650°C had a rupture life of only 49.4 hr, a minimum creep
rate of 0.024%/hr, and a fracture strain of 1.6%.

Alloys 75 and 76 were similar in composition to alloy 107, and only
limited testing has been carried out. The results of tensile tests are
summarized in Table 11. The results for the unirradiated samples agree
well with those for alloy 107 (Table 2). Alloy 75 contains 0.062% Cc,
and alloy 76 contains 0.117% C; therefore, the trends of higher strength

and lower fracture strain for alloy 76 are reasonable. Irradiation
increased strength and decreased fracture strain (Table 11). The fracture
strains agree reasonably well with those for alloy 107 irradiated at 650°C
(Table 3) and 50°C (Table 4). The samples annealed for 100 hr at 871°C
had a very small grain size, and the fracture strains were lower for
these samples. The higher carbon content of alloy 76 resulted in slightly

lower fracture strains in tensile tests.

Several samples of alloys 75 and 76 were creep tested at 650°C; the
results of these tests are summarized in Table 12. The properties of the
unirradiated alloy are quite comparable with those for alloy 107 (1.04% Ti)
that are given in Table 5. Same samples were irradiated at 760°C and
tested at 650°C; the test results are given in Table 12. Both of these
alloys had extremely good properties under these conditions. - A comparison .
with the results for heat 107 (1.04% Ti) in Table 10 reveals the superi-
ority of alloys 75 and 76. We have no explanation for this observation.

increased gradually with increasing temperature. The material annealed
for 100 hr at 871°C had a fracture strain of 52% at 25°C with a minimum
ductility of 32% at 600°C. After an anneal of 1 hr at 1177°C, the frac-
ture strain was 75% at temperatures between 25 and 600°C and then dropped
precipitously with increasing temperature. Three samples were annealed
for 1 hr at 1177°C and aged for 1000 hr at 650°C. This anneal did not
change the strength properties appreciably, but did increase the fracture
strain. Alloy 104 (0.55% Ti) was given the same anneal before testing,
and a comparison between the results for this alloy in Table 2 and those
for heat 21545 (0.49% Ti) in Table 13 shows that the commercial alloy is
slightly weaker and that both alloys have comparable fracture strains.
The results of tensile tests on irradiated samples of heat 21545
are given in Table 14. The results for samples irradiated at 650°C or
below were used in constructing Fig. 16 for a strain rate of 0.002 min=2.
The samples that were irradiated as received and those irradiated after
annealing 100 hr at 871°C had comparable fracture strains. The samples
annealed for 1 hr at 1177°C were more ductile. A comparison with the

results for alloy 104 (0.55% Ti) in Tables 3 and 4 shows that the com-
mercial alloy was more ductile and slightly weaker. Two samples in
Table 14 were irradiated at 760°C. The samples had much lower fracture
strains than those irradiated at 650°C or below, indicating again a very
strong effect of irradiation temperature.

Samples of heat 21545 were subjected to creep tests in several
annealed conditions; the results of these tests are presented in Table 15
for unirradiated samples and in Table 16 for irradiated samples. The
stress-rupture properties at 650°C in the unirradiated condition are
shown in Fig. 17. The as-received material had the longest rupture life
at a given stress level and the lowest fracture strain. Annealing at
871°C produced a material with fine grain size that failed in much
shorter times with fracture strains of about 50%. Annealing for 1 hr at
1177°C gave longer rupture lives with intermediate fracture strains of
about 30%. Aging this material at 650 or 760°C before testing had only
minor effects on the rupture life or the fracture strain. However, close

RUPTURE TIME (hr)

Fig. 17. Creep-Rupture Properties of Unirradiated Alloy 21545
(0.49% Ti) at 650°C. The number by each datum point designates the
fracture strain.

examination of the data in Table 15 reveals that the aging treatment of
1000 hr at 760°C increased the minimum creep rate.

The results of creep-rupture tests at 650°C after irradiation are
shown in Figs. 18 through 20 for material annealed 1 hr at 1177°C. The
irradiation temperatures are indicated by each datum point. At irradia-
tion temperatures of 650°C or below, the rupture life was reduced only a
small amount, and the minimum creep rate was unchanged. At an irradia-
tion temperature of 760°C and test temperature of 650°C, the rupture
life decreased at least one order of magnitude, and the minimum creep
rate increased one order of magnitude. The corresponding fracture
strains shown in Fig. 20 are 3% and higher for the samples irradiated
at 650°C or below and about 0.5% for samples irradiated at 760°C. Tests
R-841 and R-817 (Table 16) demonstrate the ability of annealing at 760°C

after irradiation to degrade the properties at 650°C. This observation

supports the premise that a structural change during annealing at 760°C
is responsible for the poor properties after irradiation. A comparison
of the results for heat 21545 in Figs. 18 through 20 with those in Fig. 14
for alloy 104 (0.55% Ti) shows good qualitative agreement.

The results of postirradiation creep tests on material having a fine

grain size (annealed at 871°C) are also given in Table 16. The fracture

were reported previously® and will be discussed only briefly in this
report. These samples were exposed to molten fluoride salt for 5600 hr
at 650°C while receiving a thermal-neutron fluence of 4.1 X 102° |
neutrons /cm?. The stress-rupture properties of these samples are shown
in Fig. 22. The unirradiated control samples were exposed to barren
fuel salt for an equivalent length of time and show a slight reduction
in rupture life (compare Figs. 17 and 22). Irradiation decreased the
rupture life about an order of magnitude, and the fracture strains
ranged from 1.6 to 3.7%. Since the metal was quite compatible with the
salt, we attribute the changes to the long thermal anneal and the neutron
exposure. |

Several creep tests were run at 760°C on both the unirradiated and
irradiated materials. The results of these tests are given in Tables 15
end 16, and the stress-rupture properties are shown graphically in
Fig. 23. The rupture life at 760°C was not reduced by irradiation at
650°C or below, but was reduced drastically by irradiation at 760°C. The
~ data in Table 16 also show that the higher irradiation temperature
increased the minimum creep rate and decreased the fracture strain.

The microstructures of several samples were examined after testing.
Typical photomicrographs of alloys 100, 102 (0.39% Ti), 104 (0.55% Ti),
and 107 (1.04% Ti) after extended aging at 650°C are shown in Fig. 24.
The carbide precipitation along grain boundaries and within the matrix
was light in alloy 100, heavier in alloy 102, and still heavier for
alloys 104 and 107. The fracture of alloy 100 after creep testing at
40,000 psi and 650°C is shown in Fig. 25. Numerous intergranular cracks
were present, and the fracture was intergranular. The short time of
about 50 hr at temperature was not sufficient to cause carbide precipita-
tion. The fracture of alloy 104 (0.55% Ti) after testing at 40,000 psi
and 650°C is shown in Fig. 26. Details of importance are the carbide
stringers, general carbide precipitation, intergranular cracking, and a
predominantly intergranular fracture. This sample was at temperature
for 1000 hr, and copious amounts of carbide precipitate formed. Photo-
micrographs of the fracture of alloy 107 (1.04% Ti) are shown in Fig. 27.

The sample was stressed at 40,000 psi at 650°C and fractured after
1490 hr. The grain size was quite small, and there were large quantities
of precipitate present. The fracture was predominantly intergranular.
‘Alloy 21545 (0.49% Ti) was examined metallographically after being
stressed at 40,000 psi at 650°C. The fracture was predominantly inter-
granular (Fig. 28). The sample was at temperature 564 hr, and some very
fine precipitation occurred in the matrix and at grain boundaries. The
stringers of precipitate were present in the annealed material before
testing (Fig. 4).
Alloy 100 (< 0.01% Ti) was examined after irradiation and creep

 

testing at 650°C. Typical microstructures are shown in Fig. 29. This
sample failed after only 1.1% strain (Table 7). There were a few inter-

- granular cracks, but the deformation seemed restricted largely to the

zone near the fracture. Some fine carbides were formed at the grain
boundaries and in the matrix. The microstructure of alloy 104 (0.55% Ti)
is shown in Fig. 30 after irradiation and creep testing at 650°C. This
alloy failed after 10.0% strain; the fracture was largely intergranular.
Alloy 107 (1.04% Ti) failed after 11.1% strain. The microstructure,

shown in Fig. 31, consists of an intergranular fracture with some carbide
precipitation.

Alloy 21545 (0.49% Ti) was examined after exposure to the MSRE core
and control facility. The material was annealed at 871°C before exposure
to give a fine grain size (Fig. 4). The samples were then exposed to
fluoride salt at 650°C for 5600 hr. Some of the samples were exposed to
barren fuel salt for controls, and others were irradiated in the MSRE
core. Microstructures of an irradiated sample that was tested at 25°C

are shown in Fig. 32. The fracture was transgranular. There was some

 

edge cracking due partially to slight changes in composition near the
surface. The comparative control sample is shown in Fig. 33. The frac-
ture was transgranular, and there was less edge cracking. Another irra-
diated sample was tested at 650°C; typical photomicrographs are shown
in Fig. 34. The fracture was intergranular, and there were a few inter-
granular cracks near the fracture. There were some edge cracks. The
control sample shown in Fig. 35 was more ductile, with 40.8% strain com-
pared with only 6.2% for the irradiated sample shown in Fig. 34. The
higher strain led to extensive intergranular cracking.

Alloys Containing Zirconium

Three groups of alloys were studied that contained various amounts
of zirconium. A series of 2-1b laboratory melts containing from less
than 0.03 to 1.18% Zr was made from virgin melting stock. These alloys
are designated 100 and 108 through 112; their chemical compositions are
given in Table 1. Typical microstructures of these alloys after a l-hr
anneal at 1177°C are shown in Fig. 36. The addition of the first 0.1% Zr
(alloy 108) markedly decreased the grain size. Further additions up to
the maximum 1.18% Zr caused only slight additional refinement in grain
size. The second group consisted of two alloys that contained 1% Zr
with additions of 0.1 and 1.0% Re. The third series of alloys consisted
of two 100-1b heats from Special Metals Corporation that contained 0.05
and 0.35% Zr, designated heats 21555 and 21554, respectively. The alloy

with the higher zirconium content from Special Metals Corporation was
initially forged at 1177°C and cracked profusely. A second alloy was
melted and forged at 1066°C, and a good product was obtained. This
experience gave the first indication that zirconium caused the alloy to
be hot-short and that it would likely have poor weldability. Typical
photomicrographs of these two alloys are shown in Figs. 37 and 38. As
received, the material contained 40% cold work; annealing at 871°C
produced a banded structure with a fine grain size and numerous carbides.
The banding is likely due to the working pattern, but there was also
some variation in the density of the carbides.

Alloys 100 and 108 through 112 were tested to determine their ten-
sile properties. Samples of each alloy were annealed 1 hr at 1177°C and
aged for 1000 hr at 650°C to match the thermal history of samples that
were irradiated. The results of tensile tests on the unirradiated
samples are given in Table 17. The variation of the strength parameters
at 650°C with zirconium content is shown in Fig. 39. The yield strength
was not affected appreciably until the zirconium level exceeded 0.3%,
but it increased markedly above this level. The ultimate tensile strength
increased about 10% with the addition of 0.1% Zr, but very little further
strengthening occurred as the zirconium content increased. In the
absence of aging, the strength was not affected by zirconium content.

The fracture strains are shown in Fig. 40 as a function of zirconium con-
tent. A very distinct maximum for aged material occurred at a concentra-
tion of about 0.3% Zr. The fracture strain was almost doubled by the
addition of even 0.1% Zr. The fracture strain at the lower strain rate
was lower, a trend that is usually observed. In unaged material, a
maximum occurred in the fracture strain for zirconium concentrations of
0.5 to 0.7%.

The same experimental alloys were irradiated at 650°C to a thermal
fluence of 2.5 X 102° neutrons/cm®. The results of tensile tests on
these samples after irradiation are summarized in Table 18, and the
variations of the fracture strains with zirconium content are shown in
Fig. 41. The postirradiation results also show a ductility maximum at
about 0.3% Zr. The results for the irradiated and unirradiated samples
are compared in Fig. 42, where the ratios of the various tensile properties

are also shown. The yield strength was increased slightly by irradiation
in alloys that contained 0.10 and 0.28% Zr (alloys 108 and 109) and
decreased slightly in the other alloys. The ultimate tensile strength
was decreased about 30% in each alloy. The fracture strain was reduced
about 50% by irradiation in alloys that contained 0.3% Zr or less and
reduced about 70% for alloys that contained more zirconium.

Samples of alloys 100 and 108 through 112 were also irradiated at

43°C to a thermal fluence of 9 X 10° neutrons/cm?. These samples were

tested at 650 and 760°C; the results are given in Table 19. The frac-

“ture strains are shown in Fig. 43 as a function of zirconium concentra-

tion. The peak in fracture strain at 650°C with zirconium concentration
still occurs, but less sharply and at a different concentration than

‘observed previously (Fig. 41). ~The fracture strains are also higher in

the experiment at lower temperature. We do not know whether to attribute
these differences to the variation in irradiation temperature or in
fluence. However, the circumstantial evidence indicates that the irra-
diation temperature is the most important factor. Recall that the yield
strengths of the aged control samples varied from 28,000 to 55,000 psi

and varied systematically with zirconium content (Fig. 39). Irradiation
at 650°C did not change these values markedly (Table 18). The yield
strengths of the alloys irradiated at 43°C are all about 33,000 psi and
do not vary detectably with zirconium content (Table 19). Thus, the
thermal treatment seems necessary to bring about the changes character-
istic of alloys with various concentrations of zirconium.

Some of the samples irradiated at 43°C were tested at 760°C. The.
fracture strain varied markedly with zirconium content (Fig. 43). How-
ever, the peak was shifted to a higher zirconium level than was noted at
a test temperature of 650°C.

Alloys 100 and 108 through 112 were also creep-rupture tested. The
results of several tests on material annealed for 1 hr at 1177°C are
shown in Table 20 and in Figs. 44 through 46. The stress-rupture proper-
ties, shown in Fig. 44, illustrate the potent effect of zirconium in
increasing the rupture life at a given level of stress. The rupture life
of alloy 109 (0.28% Zr) seems anomalously high, but the other alloys
followed the trend of increasing rupture life with increasing zirconium
content. The creep-rupture strength, shown in Fig. 45, was also
affected by the zirconium concentration. Again, alloy 109 was the only
exception to the trend of increasing strength with increasing zirconium
content. Zirconium improved the fracture strain (Fig. 46). The addition
of only 0.1% Zr (alloy 108) improved the fracture strain, compared to
that of alloy 100, several hundred percent at low strain rates. Higher

‘concentrations of zirconium improved the fracture strain at high strain

rates, but brought about little added improvement at low strain rates.

Some samples were aged for 1000 hr at 650°C to correspond to the
thermal treatment of irradiated samples. The results of creep-rupture
tests on these samples are given in Table 21. 'A comparison with the
properties of the unaged samples in Table 20 shows that this aging treat-
ment did not affect the properties appreciably.

Alloys 100 and 108 through 112 were irradiated to a thermal fluence
of 2.5 x 1020 neutrons /cm? at 650°C and subjected to creep-rupture tests
at 650°C after irradiation. The results of these tests are given in
Table 22. These samples were stressed at 32,400 psi for about 675 hr

roint. The rupture life increased rapidly with zirconium content up to
a maximum for an alloy containing 0.53% Zr. The alloys containing less

zirconium had better fracture strains under these test conditions; how-

ever, all alloys containing 0.1% Zr or more had excellent fracture strains

after irradiation. The minimum creep rates for these same samples are
given in Fig. 48. The creep rates at both stress levels exhibited a
definite minimum for the alloy containing 0.53% Zr. The creep rates for
the unirradiated control samples are also shown in Fig. 48 at the
32,400 psi stress level. The minimum creep rate was not affected detect-
ably by irradiation except for the alloys containing 0.75 and 1.18% Zr.

A second irradiation experiment exposed samples to a thermal-neutron

fluence of 9 X 1019 neutrons/em? at 50°C. These results are summarized

(1) the rupture life increased and the creep rate decreased continuously
with increasing zirconium (Table 23); (2) the rupture lives of these
samples were greater than those of samples irradiated at 650°C (Table 22);
(3) the minimum creep rates were lower than those observed before irra-
diation (Fig. 45); and (4) the fracture strains were all quite good.

Tests were run at 760°C on several samples; the results are shown
in Table 24. For samples irradiated and tested at 760°C, the minimum
creep rate decreased with increasing zirconium (Fig. 49). The fracture
strain seemed to go through a maximum in alloys that contained 0.1 to
0.28% Zr. Test samples of alloy 108 (0.1% Zr) indicated that the irra-
diation temperature had very little effect when the test temperature was
760°C. A test sample of this same composition also indicated that
annealing at 650°C after irradiation at 43°C had very little effect on
the properties. A single sample of alloy 112 (1.18% 2r) was irradiated
at 760°C and tested at 650°C. The rupture life at 30,000 psi was only
444.9 hr compared with more than 675 hr for a sample stressed at
32,400 psi after irradiation at 650°C (Table 22). However, the fracture
strain was quite good for both samples.

Two other alloys were made that contained a nominal 1% Zr. These
two alloys, designated 146 and 147, also contained O.1 and 1% Re, respec-
tively, an addition that was made in an attempt to improve the weldabil-
ity. These alloys were creep tested in the irradiated and unirradiated
conditions; the results are given in Tables 25 and 26, and the stress-
rupture properties are shown graphically in Fig. 50. The stress-rupture
properties of the unirradiated samples are about the same for both heats
and quite similar to those shown in Fig. 44 for alloy 108 (1.18% zr).
Thus, rhenium does not appear to be a very influential addition; the
properties are basically those of an alloy containing 1% Zr. The single
test of an unirradiated sample of each heat that had been aged for
1000 hr at 760°C indicates an instability in this alloy. This anneal
decreased the rupture life and increased the minimum creep rate. Irra-
djation at 650°C reduced the rupture life and fracture strain when
samples were tested at 650°C (Fig. 50). Irradiation at a higher temper-
ature further reduced rupture life, but the fracture strain remained

reasonably high.

The two 100-1b commercial melts, heat 21555 (0.05% Zr) and 21554
(0.35% Zr) were evaluated in both tensile and creep tests. The tensile
results are shown in Tables 27 and 28. The tests on heat 21555 after
irradiation showed that the coarse-grained material had superior ductil-
ity and that the fine-grained material had higher yield strength. The
tensile results for heat 21554 (0.35% Zr) are summarized in Table 28,
and the fracture strain for the fine-grained material is shown in Fig. 51.
The behavior is similar to that observed for standard Hastelloy N, but
at 760°C the ductility of the zirconium-modified alloy was much lower.
The strong dependence of fracture strain on strain rate at 760°C was
also quite unusual where the fracture strain was higher at the lower
strain rate. After irradiation, the fracture strain of the fine-grained
material was generally reduced, and the reduction was larger at higher
test temperatures (Fig. 52). The ratios of the various properties in
the irradiated and unirradiated alloys are shown in Fig. 53. The yield
and ultimate tensile strengths were not affected appreciably by irradia-
tion. The elongation remained high with increasing temperature and
dropped at test temperatures above 600°C. The high ratio at 760°C is
due to the very low fracture strain of the unirradiated sample. The
reduction in area follows the normal pattern for standard Hastelloy N.

Further analysis of the results in Table 28 shows the effects of

various annealing treatments. Several samples were annealed for 100 hr

at 871°C followed by 1000 hr at 650°C. The strengths were lower and the

fracture strains higher than those of the samples held at 650°C for a
much longer time. Two samples were annealed for 1 hr at 1177°C and then
for 1000 hr at 760°C. - This treatment gave good strength and ductility
characteristics. Some samples were irradiated that had heat treatments
other than those already discussed. The strains after irradiation were
higher for samples annealed for 1 hr at 1177°C than for those annealed
at 871°C.
Irradiated and unirradiated samples of heats 21555 (0.05% Zr) and
21554 (0.35% zr) were tested in creep. The creep results at 650°C for
heat 21555 are given in Tables 29 and 30, and the stress-rupture proper-
ties are shown in Fig. 54. In the unirradiated conditions, the optimum

rupture life was obtained after a l-hr anneal at 1177°C. Further aging

for 1000 hr at 650°C produced no detectable effect, but aging for 1000 hr
at 760°C decreased the time to failure. Annealing at 871°C to produce a
fine grain size resulted in shorter rupture lives. Irradiated samples
had been annealed at 1177 and 871°C before irradiation. As shown in
Fig. 54, irradiation reduced the rupture life of the larger grained mate-
rial by a factor of about 2 and that of the finer grained material by a
factor of about 10.

The minimum creep rate of heat 21555, shown in Fig. 55, was not
affected appreciably by irradiation. The lowest minimum creep rate was

obtained by annealing at 1177°C; aging at 650°C had no effect; aging at

760°C increased the creep rate; and annealing at 871°C to give a small

grain size produced a high creep rate.
The results of creep tests on heat 21554 (O. 35% Zr) are given in
Tables 31 and 32. The stress-rupture properties at 650°C are shown in

Fig. 56. The same general trends with regard to heat treatment were

observed for this heat and for the heat with lower zirconium content

(heat 21555). The optimum rupture life occurred after a l-hr anneal at

1177°C. Irradiation reduced the rupture life of the material annealed
at 1177°C by a factor of 2 to 3 and that of the fine-grained material by
a factor of about 10. The variation of the minimum creep rate with heat
treatment and irradiation is shown in Fig. 57. The lowest minimum creep
rate was observed for the material annealed at 1177°C. No effect of
irradiation on the minimum creep rate was evident.

The fracture strains are shown as a function of minimum creep rate
in Fig. 58 for material annealed at 1177°C and tested in the unirradiated
condition at 650°C. The results for heat 21554 (0.35% Zr) show a clear
trend of decreasing fracture strain with decreasing creep rate. The
results for heat 21555 (0.05% Zr) show a similar trend, but the data.
seem to fall on two separate line segments. All of the fracture strains
are quite high and fall largely in the range of 20 to 40%. The results
in Tables 29 and 31 show that the samples of both alloys that were |
annealed at 871°C to give a fine grain size had fracture strains of 40

to 60%.

The fracture strains of irradiated samples of heats 21554 and 21555
are shown in Fig. 59 as a function of strain rate. The results generally
follow a trend of increasing fracture strain with decreasing creep rate,

although one point definitely deviates from this trend.

Fig. 59. Fracture Strains at 650°C of Alloys 21554 (0.35% Zr) and
21555 (0.05% Zr) after Irradiation.’ All samples annealed 1 hr at 1177°C
before irradiation.

The results for a test temperature of 760°C are fragmentary
(Tables 29 through 32). The stress-rupture characteristics are shown
in Figs. 60 and 61 for heats 21555 (0.05% Zr) and 21554 (0.05% Zr).
Rupture life was reduced by irradiation, but the samples annealed at
1177°C before irradiation had longer rupture lives than those annealed
at 871°C. The fracture strains were reduced by irradiation, and the
results for heat 21554 (Table 32) indicate that the reduction was greater
as the irradiation temperature increased.

Several tested samples were examined metallographically. Typical
photomicrographs of several alloys that contained zirconium are shown
in Fig. 62. These samples were annealed 1 hr at 1177°C, aged 1000 hr

at 650°C, and stressed for 1000 hr at 650°C. Alloy 108 (0.10% Zr) had

a very fine carbide precipitate typical of that observed in alloy 100
(Fig. 24), which did not contain zirconium. In alloy 109 (0.28% Zr) the
precipitate was coarser and located predominantly along the grain bound-
aries. Alloys 110 (0.53% Zr) and 111 (0.75% Zr) contained a very fine
precipitate that could not be resolved at a magnification of 500%.
Alloy 112 (1.18% Zr) had an even higher concentration of precipitate
(Fig. 63). Figure 63(c) shows that the precipitate was acicular. The
grain boundaries had 8 denuded zone, and there was a denuded region asso-
ciated with the oxide at the surface. The precipitate was extracted and
found by x-ray diffraction to have a lattice parameter of 4.68 A, equal
to that for zirconium carbide. We also strained some samples of

alloy 112 at 25°C after they had been aged at 650°C to produce the
precipitate. The fracture strains were in excess of 50%, thus indicating
that this microstructure was not brittle.

Some of the aged samples were tensile tested at 650°C (Table 17).
The fracture of alloy 112 after testing at 650°C at a strain rate of
0.002 min! is shown in Fig. 64. The fracture strain was 23.3%, and the
fracture was transgranular.

The fracture of alloy 110 (0.53% Zr), which was tested in creep at
650°C, is shown in Fig. 65. This alloy was at temperature 709 hr, and
small quantities of precipitate are present in the microstructure. This
precipitate cannot be resolved at low magnification and appears as dark
spots. There are numerous intergranular cracks, and the fracture is
intergranular. Typical photomicrographs of alloy 112 (1.18% Zr) after
creep testing at 650°C are shown in Fig. 66. This sample was at temper-
ature 1255 hr, and large quantities of precipitate are present in the
microstructure. There are numerous intergranular cracks, and the frac-
ture has both intergranular and transgranular components.

Typical fractures of alloy 21555 (0.05% Zr) after testing at 650°C
and 32,400 psi are shown in Fig. 67. When this alloy was annealed
100 hr at 650°C before testing, the grain size was quite small. This
sample was strained 65.9% before it fractured (Table 29), predominantly
transgranularly [Fig. 67(a2)]. Annealing for 1 hr at 1177°C and testing

in creep resulted in the microstructure shown in Fig. 67(b). The

fracture was still largely intergranular, and the fracture strain was
31.8%. Annealing at 1177°C and aging for 1000 hr at 650°C resulted in
a fracture strain of 34.1% (Table 29). The microstructure contained
only a few small precipitates, and the fracture was still largely trans-
granular. Alloy 21554 (0.35% Zr) was subjected to a similar annealing
sequence. After annealing for 100 hr at 871°C and 1000 hr at 650°C and
testing at 650°C the fracture shown in Fig. 68(a) was obtained. This
alloy originally had stringers present (Fig. 38), and numerous cracks
formed around these stringers during testing. The fracture was trans-
granular, and the fracture strain was 55.1% (Table 31). Annealing for
1 hr at 1177°C produced a coarser grain size. The fracture shown in
Fig. 68(b) was mixed intergranular and transgranular, and the fracture
strain was about 20%. The approximately 1000 hr at temperature during
the creep test was sufficient to produce some precipitation. Another
sample was annealed 1 hr at 1177°C and aged for 1000 hr before testing.
This sample failed with about 20% strain. The fracture was mixed trans-
granular and intergranular [Fig. 68(a)]. Copious quantities of very fine
precipitate formed.

Alloy 108 (0.10% Zr) was also examined metallographically after
irradiation and creep testing. As shown in Fig. 69, a very fine precipi-
tate was formed that was quite similar to that shown in Fig. 62 for an
unirradiated sample. Alloy 110 (0.53% Zr) had more precipitate after
irradiation than the control sample (compare Figs. 70 and 62). As shown
in Fig. 70 there was a denuded zone along the boundaries and some banding
of the precipitate, likely due to inhomogeneous distribution of zirconium
in the alloy. The fracture was largely intergranular. Alloy 112
(1.18% Zr) had profuse quantities of the precipitate; the microstructure,
however, was quite similar to that for the unirradiated sample (compare
Figs. 71 and 63). The sample could not be etched heavily enough to show
the grain boundaries without obliterating the precipitate. The fracture
was mixed intergranular and transgranular. ) | :

650°C is shown in Fig. 74; it fractured intergranularly after 11.2%
strain. The comparable control sample, shown in Fig. 75, strained 46.6%
before failing. There are numerous intergranular separations, and the

fracture is largely intergranular.

Alloys Containing Hafnium

Two groups of alloys were used to study the effects of hafnium
content on the mechanical properties. The first group was composed of
five laboratory melts that contained from 0.06 to 0.43% Hf (designated
alloys 152 through 156), and the second group consisted of two 100-1b
commercial melts that contained 0.08 and 0.50% Hf (designated
alloys 67-503 and 67-504, respectively). The chemical compositions of
these alloys are given in Table 1, and typical photomicrographs are
shown in Figs. 76 through 80. Alloy 153 (Fig. 76) contained only 0.06% Hf

. and had the largest grain size of the group. Alloys 154 (0.10% Hf) and

155 (0.13% Hf) had much smaller grain sizes. Alloy 152 contained
0.16% Hf, and the grain size was refined by copious quantities of carbide
precipitates at grain boundaries. When the hafnium content was increased
to 0.43%, as in alloy 156, the precipitation became more general with
precipitation at grain boundaries and in the matrix. The two commercial
alloys had larger grain sizes than their counterparts in the series of
laboratory melts (Figs. 79 and 80). ’

alloys are shown in Fig. 81. The results for alloy 100, which contained
no detectable hafnium, are used for comparative purposes. The general
observation is that the rupture life increased with increasing hafnium
content up to about 0.16%. The stress-rupture properties of the irra-
diated alloys shown in Fig. 82 were even more dependent upon the hafnium
content than those of the unirradiated material. In this condition,
alloy 156 (0.43% Hf) had far superior stress-rupture properties.
The minimum creep rates of alloys 100 and 152 through 156 are
shown in Fig. 83. The alloys that contained hanfium had lower creep
rates, but the magnitudes showed no clear dependence upon the concentra-
tion between 0.06 and 0.43% Hf.. Irradiation caused a slight increase
in the creep rate of most alloys; alloy 156 (0.43% Hf) seemed unaffected.
The fracture strains of the alloys in the unirradiated condition are

shown in Fig. 84. Generally, the alloys followed the trend of decreasing

before irradiation at 650°C.

The commercial alloys, 67-503 (0.08% Hf) and 67-504 (0.50% Hf) were
subjected to various tests. The results of tensile tests on alloy 67-503
are given in Table 35. The results on irradiated tests showed clearly
that the anneal of 1 hr at 1177°C before test gave superior fracture
strains at 650°C. More detailed testing was carried out on heat 67-504
(0.50% Hf). This alloy was included in the surveillance program for the
MSRE. Samples were exposed to a molten fluoride fuel salt in the core
for 9800 hr at 650°C and received a thermal-neutron fluence of 5.3 Xx 1020
neutrons/cm?. Control samples were exposed to static barren salt for

9800 hr at 650°C. Some test results on these samples are presented in .

Table 36; details of these tests were discussed previously.’ The frac-
ture strains at a strain rate of 0.05 min! are shown in Fig. 86 as a
function of test temperature. The material in the unirradiated condition
was characterized by a high fracture strain of about 50% that decreased
gradually with increasing temperature above 650°C. Irradiation caused
a general decrease in the fracture strain; the decrease was largest at
test temperatures of 25°C and above 600°C. The decrease at 25°C was
likely associated with carbide precipitation and has been observed for
many other modified and standard heats.” The decrease at high tempera-
tures is due to helium produced during irradiation. Similar results for
a lower strain rate of 0.002 min~! are shown in Fig. 87. The fracture
strains were lower than those observed at the higher strain rate. Addi-
tional results given in Table 36 show that the higher anneal of 1 hr at
1177°C resulted in better fracture strains after irradiation than the
anneal of 8 hr at 871°C. The samples irradiated in the MSRE for 9800 hr
had slightly higher fracture strains than those irradiated in the ORR
for about 1100 hr. This may have resulted from the different thermal
histories or from the drastically different flux spectra.

TEST TEMPERATURE (°C)

Fig. 87. Variation of Fracture Strain of Alloy 67-504 with Test
Temperature at a Strain Rate of 0.002 min™l. Annealed 1 hr at 1177°C.
Irradiated at 650°C.

The results of creep-rupture tests on heat 67-503 are given in
Table 37. The stress-rupture properties are shown graphically in
Fig. 88, and the creep characteristics are shown in Fig. 89. Irradia-
tion reduced the rupture life more at 760°C than at 650°C. Irradiation
at 650°C had no effect on the minimum creep rate, but irradiation at
760°C increased the minimum creep rate (Fig. 89).

Results of creep-rupture tests for heat 67-504 (0.50% Hf) are sum-
marized in Table 38. Data are included from the MSRE surveillance
program. The stress-rupture characteristics are shown in Fig. 90. This
heat had a rupture life eight to ten times higher than that of heat 67-503
(0.08% Hf). The samples aged in fluoride salt for 9800 hr had slightly
shorter rupture lives than those annealed 1 hr at 1177°C before test.
Irradiation at 650°C reduced the rupture life, but less for the samples
irradiated in the MSRE than for those irradiated in the ORR. Irradia-
tion at 760°C in the ORR drastically decreased the rupture life. The
minimm creep rates for these samples are shown graphically in Fig. 91.
The creep strength of heat 67-504 is about ten times that of heat 67-503.
The minimum creep rate was unaffected by aging at 650°C for 9800 hr in
static salt or by short-term (1000-hr) irradiation at 650°C. Irradia-
tion at 650°C in the MSRE increased the creep rate, and irradiation at

760°C drastically increased the creep rate.

650°C reduced the rupture life, but irradiation at 760°C reduced it much
more. The fracture strains in the irradiated condition are shown in
Fig. 94. The fracture strains of heat 67-503 were 3 to 4% when irra-
diated and tested at 760°C. Irradiation at 760°C and testing at either
650 or 760°C resulted in lower fracture strains. Heat 67-504 generally
had fracture strains of 6 to 8% when irradiated at 650°C and tested at
650 or 760°C. Irradiation at 760°C resulted in fracture strains as low
as 0.6%.

Several of the samples were examined metallographically after test-
ing. Typical photomicrographs of a sample of heat 67-504 after exposure
to a noncorrosive fluoride salt for 9800 hr at 650°C and testing at 25°C
are shown in Fig. 95. The fracture was partially intergranular, although
the bulk grains elongated greatly. Also more carbides formed than in the
annealed material shown in Fig. 80. At 650°C, the grains still showed

although the final fracture was mixed intergranular and transgranuler
(Fig. 96). After irradiation, the fracture of ‘heat 67-504 at 25°C

(Fig. 97) was more intergranular than that of the unirradiated material
(Fig. 95). A typical fracture of heat 67-503 after creep testing at
650°C is shown in Fig. 98. There are numerous intergranular cracks,

and the fracture is predominantly intergranular. Heat 67-504 (Fig. 99)
exhibited fewer intergranular cracks and a fracture that was mixed inter-

granular and transgranular.

Alloy Containing No Additions

The results for a small, 2-1b laboratory melt (alloy 100) that con-
tained no additions of Ti, Zr, or Hf were presented above. One small,
100-1b commercial alloy (heat 21546) was also procured. This alloy was
received in the cold-worked condition. Samples were tested in this con-
dition and after annealing at 871 and 1177°C. Typical photomicrographs
of the material are shown in Figs. 100 and 101. The microstructure after
annealing at 871°C was characterized by bands of precipitate and fine
grains. The bands were caused by carbide precipitation and retarded
recrystallization in these areas. The material outside these bands was
recrystallized. Annealing for 1 hr at 1177°C (Fig. 101) completed
recrystallization. Some stringers were still present, although none
are visible in Fig. 101. These stringers were quite similar to those
found in heat 21545 and appeared to be unmelted molybdenum.

The results of tensile tests on this material are summarized in
Table 39. The fracture strains are shown as a function of temperature
in Fig. 102. Up to about 700°C, the material annealed 1 hr at 1177°C
had the highest fracture strain and the cold-worked material had the
lowest fracture strain. Above 700°C, the ductility of the cold-worked

material increased markedly. Only samples as received and as annealed

‘100 hr at 871°C were irradiated, and these were all tested at 600°C and

above. Irradiation decreased the fracture strain of all samples.

The results of creep tests on this material are given in Table 40.
In the unirradiated condition, the material as received had the highest
strength and the material annealed at 871°C had the lowest strength.

The strength of material annealed 1 hr at 1177°C fell intermediate, and
several illustrations follow to compare the properties of irradiated and
unirradiated material annealed 1 hr at 1177°C. The stress-rupture proper-
ties at 650°C are shown in Fig. 103. The irradiation temperature was an
important factor; the higher the irradiation temperature, the shorter was
the rupture life. The two sets of data seem to converge, indicating

that at very low levels of stress there would be no effect of irradiation
on the rupture life. The creep rates are shown in Fig. 104 for 650°C.

As long as the irradiation temperature was about 650°C, there was no
difference between the creep rates of irradiated and unirradiated mate-
rial. At irradiation temperatures of 700°C and above, the postirradia-
tion creep rate was increased. There was at least one datum point that
disagreed with this general trend. These curves also converged, again
indicating common behavior at low stresses.

The fracture strains of irradiated samples tested at 650°C are
shown as a function of minimum creep rate in Fig. 105. All of the sam-
ples irradiated above 700°C had fracture strains of 1.1 to 0.2%. Irra-
diation at about 650°C resulted in fracture strains of 1.1 to 5.1%. The
exact dependence of the fracture strain on strain rate cannot be deter-

mined from the available data, and the indicated curve is influenced by

results on standard Hastelloy N (ref. 8).

Hastelloy N with Strain Rate,” J. Nucl. Mater. 31(1), 67-85 (1969).

Some samples were tested at 760°C; the rather sparse results are
given in Table 40, and the stress-rupture data are shown in Fig. 106.
There was an indication that irradiation at 746°C may result in poorer
stress-rupture properties at 760°C than irradiation at 799 to 832°C.

The minimum creep rate at 760°C (Fig. 107) showed that irradiation did
not alter the creep rate drastically. However, there was again the ten-
dency for the three samples irradiated at 746°C to show the greater
effect. The fracture strains at 760°C were all quite low (0.4 to 1.5%
strain) except for the sample irradiated at 499°C (3.1% strain).

Some insight into the effect of irradiation temperature was gained
by transmission electron microscopy. Typical microstructures for two
samples irradiated at 666 and 766°C are shown in Figs. 108 and 109.

were also numerous precipi-

tates within the grains. After irradiation at 766°C (Fig. 109), there

were fewer relatively coarse precipitates along the grain boundaries,

and only random coarse precipitates were present within the grains. The

precipitates in both samples were identified -as carbides of the M;C type

in which the metal component was primarily molybdenum. Thus, the poorer

postirradiation properties are associated with the very coarse precipitate.
A typical fracture of heat 21546 at 650°C is shown in Fig. 110.

There was extensive intergranular cracking, and the fracture was entirely

intergranular. The random stringers are obvious in this field and may have

been instrumental in causing the fracture at this particular location.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

A large amount of data has been presented, and we should recapitu-

late some of the most important observations.
 

 

136

1. A modified base composition of Hastelloy N was developed:
Ni-12% Mo—7% Cr-0.2% Mn—0.05% C. This alloy is free of the carbide
stringers present in standard Hastelloy N, but is still very susceptible
to embrittlement by irradiation.

2. Additions of Ti, Zr, or Hf to this base composition improved
resistance to irradiation embrittlement. Small heats showed a general
improvement with increasing additions of titanium and hafnium. Similar
work with additions of zirconium showed that an alloy containing 0.53% Zr
had the minimum creep rate and maximum rupture life. Other concentra-
tions of zirconium resulted in higher fracture strains.

3. Commercial melts (100 1b) were obtained with nominal additions
of 0.5% each of Ti, Zr, and Hf. The properties of these alloys were
comparable with those of the small, laboratory melts (2 1b).

4. Properties were very dependent upon the irradiation temperature.
Irradiation at about 650°C resulted in good properties, but irradiation
at 700°C and above gave relatively poor properties.

5. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the effect of
irradiation temperature was associated with the precipitation of coarser
carbides at the higher temperature. During irradiation at 650°C, fine
carbides precipitated, whereas above 700°C relatively coarse carbides
formed.

6. The optimum properties after irradiation result from annealing
for 1 hr at 1177°C before irradiation. The fine-grained microstructure
obtained by annealing at low temperatures such as 871°C was not as strong
or as ductile, and annealing above 1177°C decreased the fracture strain
of irradiated and unirradiated samples.

7. The general trend revealed by metallographic examination after
testing was that additions of Ti, Zr, and Hf reduced the frequency of
cracking at grain boundaries. Fractures in these alloys in creep at
650°C are predominantly intergranular but usually have some transgranular
components.

Some comparisons are in order to show the relative properties of
these alloys and standard Hastelloy N. For this comparison, we used
only the commercial alloys with 0.5% nominal additions of Ti, Zr, and
Hf. All results are for samples annealed 1 hr at 1177°C. The tensile

and yield strengths are shown in Fig. 111. Alloys 21546 and 21545

(0.49% Ti) had very similar properties; the observed strengths were
slightly less than those measured for standard Hastelloy N. The strength
of heat 67-504 (0.50% Hf) was the highest of all alloys studied. The
fracture strains of these samples are shown in Fig. 112. Alloys 21546,
21545 (0.49% Ti), 21554 (0.35% Zr), and 67-504 (0.50% Hf) have similar
properties. Heat 67-504 (0.50% Hf) after aging for 9800 hr at 650°C had
fracture strains lower than those of the other modified alloys when tested
below about 650°C and higher above this temperature. Standard Hastelloy N

had lower fracture strains than any of the modified alloys.

strength than rupture life; these data are shown in Fig. 114. At
40,000 psi, the minimum creep rate varied from 0.03%/hr for alloy 21546
to 0.002%/nhr for alloy 67-504 (0.50% Hf). The addition of hafnium
increased strength the most, by far, but the three alloys modified with
Hf, Zr, and Ti were all stronger than standard Hastelloy N. There was
not much difference between the creep strengths of standard Hastelloy N
and the modified base alloy 21546. The fracture strains of the unirra-
diated modified alloys are shown in Fig. 115. All of the alloys except
alloy 21545 (0.49% Ti) followed the trend of decreasing fracture strain
with decreasing creep rate. At high strain rates, alloy 21554 (0.35% 2r)
had the highest fracture strain. At low strain rates, alloy 21545
(0.49% Ti) had superior ductility. Alloy 21546 and standard Hastelloy N
had the lowest fracture strains and did not differ appreciably from each
other.

(0.35% Zr), 21545 (0.49% Ti), and 67-504 (0.50% Hf) had equally good
properties. All three of the modified alloys showed improvement over
the standard Hastelloy N shown for reference. The base modified

alloy 21546 had properties quite similar to those of standard Hastelloy N.

. Standard Hastelloy N that contained about 0.5% Si is not sensitive to

irradiation temperature, and the indicated line holds for irradiation at
760°C (ref. 9). Heats 21546 and 21545 (0.49% Ti) both had poor stress-
rupture properties after irradiation at 760°C. The stress-rupture proper-
ties of alloy 67-504 (0.50% HF) fell intermediate between those of these
two alloys and those of standard Hastelloy N.

The postirradiation fracture strains for irradiation and testing
at 650°C are summarized in Fig. 117. These curves are based on rather
sparse data and should be considered as schematics. Alloy 21546 shows

- some improvement over standard Hastelloy N. Alloy 21545 (0.49% Ti) is

generally better than standard Hastelloy N, but still has a distinct
ductility minimum of only about 3%. The sparse data for heats 21554
(0.35% Zr) and 67-504 (0.50% Hf) indicate that these heats had improved
fracture strains. The presence of a ductility minimum has been estab-
lished for standard Hastelloy N and for heat 21545, but there are too
few data to establish whether the other alloys conform to this pattern.

Many of the properties of these alloys are likely determined by the
carbide precipitate. As already shown, alloy 21546 exhibited a change
in properties after irradiation that correlated well with changes in the
carbide structure (Figs. 108 and 109). Further work by Gehlbach and
Cook1® showed that Ti, Hf, and Zr promoted the formation of the MC type
of carbides. The normal type of carbide for Hastelloy N is M,C when the
silicon content is low and McC when the silicon content is high.ll The
work of Gehlbach and Cook!® also showed that low levels (about 0.5%) of
Ti, Hf, and Zr can result in an MC type of carbide at 650°C and a rela-
tively coarse M,C type at 760°C. Thus, the strong effect of irradiation
temperature on these alloys is associated with this transition in carbide
types.

~ The mechanism whereby these precipitates improve the unirradiated
creep properties also likely has to do with the carbide precipitates.l?
As shown in Fig. 114, the creep strength is increased with the addition
of Ti, Zr, and Hf. These effects are larger than anticipated from solid~-
solution strengthening, particularly when one considers that most of the
alloying additions are likely tied up as carbides. Thus; the strengthen-
ing observed is likely due to the finely dispersed carbide phase. These
precipitates also likely impede crack propagation and account for the
improved fracture strains (Fig. 115).

In irradiated material, the further complication of helium trans-
muted for the 1°B exists. Our reasoning in adding Ti, Hf, and Zr was to
tie the boron up in dispersed precipitates. The only measure that we
have of the location of boron is to assume that it behaves like the car-

"bon. Thus, each carbide precipitate contains some boron. The finely

divided MC type of carbide gives a better dispersion and would be
expected to give better properties. Thus, the qualitative observation
that the fine MC type of precipitates are associated with good proper=-
ties and the coarse M,C type with poor porperties seems quite reasonable.
The further role of these precipitates in inhibiting propagation of
cracks may also be important.

All of the modified alloys are slightly susceptible to aging during
long-term annealing. These changes are quite small and are associated
with precipitation of carbides. The general effects of aging are that
the minimum creep rate and fracture strain increase and the rupture life
decreases. Because of the difference in the type of carbide precipitated
at 650 and 760°C in many of these alloys, aging-at 760°C seems to pro-
duce larger changes in properties. The precipitation of copious quanti:
ties of ZrC in alloys that contain less than 0.5% Zr is quite dramatic,

but the changes in properties are minimal.
SUMMARY

This first phase of this study of the effects of additions of Ti,
Zr, and Hf to a base alloy of Ni-12% Mo—7% Cr-0.2% Mn~0.05% C dealt with
small, laboratory melts and the first 100-1b commercial melts. The
results show that these three elements improve the creep strength and
fracture strain in unirradiated alloys. Tests on samples irradiated at
650°C or less show that the rupture lives at a given stress level and
the fracture strains are improved markedly. Irradiation at 760°C results
in very poor properties. The good properties are associated with the
formation of a very fine MC type of carbide and the poor properties with

a very coarse M,C type of carbide.
