‘Bubbles, Drops, and Entrainment in Molten Salts

Harold W. Kohn"

To entrain’ is defined as follows, "to carry along or over (especial-
ly mechanically) as fine drops of liquid during distillation". One can
thus envision many entrainment systems, some of which are pertinent to
studies being done here (viz. entrainment of process salt by liquid
bismuth). The discussion in this report however will be confined to
studies of the entrainment of solid and of liquid particles by gases.
Molten salt processes associated with the MSRE usually use an
inert cover gas. This gas is often moving along the surface and, in
some processes, is even swept through the molten salt. Hence we can
expect some form of gas-particle entrainment to play a part in most
molten salt experiments. The situation is particularly aggravated in
the MSRE pump bowl where & considerable (U4 L/min. corresponding to a
minimum L.S.V. of 0.35 cm. /min. } flow of ‘helium is used to sparge xenon

from the reactor fuel” .

In order to have entrainment, some mechanism for the production of
fine particles is also required. Our literature search has shown that
bubbles end splashes are the principal sources of fine droplets and
sprays. Again let us direct our attention to the MSRE pump bowl. This
bowl is a lentil shaped reservoir containing sbout one hundred liters
of molten salt. One inch shove the surface of this salt pool is a
spray ring from which salt and helium are sprayed at a lively rate
(sixty-five gallons per minute). This leads to entrainment of one to
two percent of the helium by the fuel. It can give rise not only to
some directly formed aerosol, but also secondary droplets from splashes.
‘Since the fuel now also contains up to two percent by volume of helium
bubbles, on reaching the (pump bowl) surface, these may give rise to
Jet droplets when they burst.

These phenomena, may bear on the ultimate fate of the MSRE fission
products in the following way: there are reasons, derived from chem-

ical thermodynamics” for believing that many of these fission products,

specifically Nb, Mo end Ru, are present in the fuel as metal. As metals, .

their vapor pressure would be vanishingly small, yet they appear to
favor the gas phase over the 11quia®. Since the MSRE fuel does not
wet the metal’ the spray from the spray ring could be dispersing a

metal fog directly, i.e., there is no reason to expect a droplet of salt

plus metal to adhere. This non-wetting characteristic also creates a

possibility for flotation of the metal particles in the fue1®. There

is evidence, as discussed later, that such an interface scum would be

preferentially removed (ejected into the gas phase) by Jet droplets
from bursting bubbles. The pump bowl liquid is quite agitated which
argues against this mechanism. Without a detailed study of flow
patterns » however, one cannot sey for sure that areas amenable to the
existence of stable scum do not exist in the pump bowl. It is much
more likely that a steble scum exists within the sampling ares since
this area is protected from the turbulence by & cylindrical mist shield
which extends from the top of the gas space nearly to the bottom of the
liquid. Therefore consideration of the entrainment process not only
points the way to an explanation of the peculiar disposition of the
fission products, it indicates that the samples, since they are taken
within the mist shield, may not be representative of the processes going

~

on within the reactor pump bowl.
Summary of Previous Work

A literature search was completed using "drops", "entrainment",

and "bubbles" as key words. Discussions with laboratory staff members

supplied additional references.

An actual measurement of entrainment of Cs*37 in a boiling water

reactor was made by Shor and co-workers. They pointed out the many

A great deal of the definitive work on jet droplets was done by
D. C. Blanchard® end his associates in connection with oceanographic
studies? ™™. Most of the information is contained in Figs. 1 and 2 of
this report and concerns bursting bubbles in sea water. One may convert
from mass of salt to droplet size by remembering the sea water contains |
from 3.15 to 3.5% salt. The other data has been added to the graph
using the 3.15% figure. The results of a bubble bursting at a surface

can be both spectaculer and surprising. If we limit ourselves, as

Blanchard and associates did, to bubbles two millimeters and less in

diameter, we see that from five to seven Jet droplets can be ejected
per bubble ‘burst, and that these drops may be up to nearly 0.2 mm. in
diameter, and all the drops might contain close to one milligram of
material. The topmost drop is flung nearly twenty centimeters into the
air; the others do not perform so spectacularly.

The high speed photographs shown in Refs. 12 and 15 delineate quite
clearly and remarkably the history of the bursting bubble which is also
shown pictorially in Fig. 3. If the surface is clean, the bubbles will
burst almost immediately. No agglomeration (growth of large bubbles at
the expense of small ones) was observed for sea water. Liquid from the
£ilm at the top of the bubble drains until it ruptures; a flow of
liquid down the side of the liquid cavity then ensues. This leads to
the formation of the jet drop, (Fig. 3). A vortex ring is also formed
end ejected downvards, shown quite clearly by using India ink as a
tracersl. However the formation and behavior of this vortex ring is

enter the liquid. Jet droplets can also be formed by splashes in one

of two manners. A drop hitting the surface invariably punches a clear
cylindrical hole which may or may not have a sheer cylindrical wall

rising Prom 141% 17,18

This wall either closes over, or forms a crown
vhich breaks up into a fine spray. If the hole does close, it soon
reopens, and a long Jet which breaks into jet droplets appears.
Blanchard and associates considered also the formation of bubbles
from splash drops and the equilibrium between small bubbles and dis-
solved gas. The splash drops produce very tiny (fifty micron) bubbles.
A rather discouraging feature of this mechanism for material transport
is that unless there is adequate supersaturation most of these bubbles
will go back into solution. However, in so doing they will raise the
supersaturation until a point is reached where such bubbles will grow.
Blanchard also found that the Jet droplets from bursting bubbles

carry a positive charge A greater charge may be induced by

 

applying a local field; by using a positive field the charge sign on

17

the drops can be reversed. Hobbs and Kezweeny ' on the other hand

found that the droplets formed from splashes carried a negative charge
2y,22 support of their measurements. This
difference in charge sign seems most unusual since the mechanism of
formation of the large droplets from the Rayleigh Jet seems identical
with its formation from bubbles. The larger droplets, those from the

Jet rather than from the crown, carry the higher charge per unit mess,

thus accentuating the difference. Hobbs has also observed a linear

relationship between the number of splash droplets and the distance of
fall, He has also observed a peaking in the maximum rise height at a
particular liquid depth, ebout 8 mm. for water.

An important consideration from our standpoint is that the Jet
droplets cen also remove surface conteminants. This had been shown
experimentally by Blanchard’ (see also ref. 8, p. 107); the mechanism
of this removel and the use of bubbles as & surface microtome has also

been discussed by MacIntyre ®.

The oceanographers were interested primarily in bubbles less than
two millimeters in digmeter end this led them into a mild controversy
with e rival group of engineers (Imperial College, London) who were more
interested in the bursting of larger (2-5 mm.) bubbles. The 2-3 mm.
size range is critical since it is generally accepted rt thet in water,
bubbles greater than 3 mm. in dismeter are inherently unstable, The

Imperial College group has shown at least for large bubbles that in

addition to the jet droplets that accompany bubble breakup, there is =a

fine spray resulting from the breakup of the bubble dome >? 3%, For
bubbles grester than 5 mm. diameter, all the droplets came from rupture
of the bubble dome. They also discovered that a temperature increase

caused & marked decrease-in the number of jet droplets. The question

was pretty much resolved by another group of engineers (Birmingham)??

who showed that most of the mass of the droplets from bubbles 2 mm.
and less in size came from the jet droplets, whereas for large bubbles
most of the mass comes from breakup of the bubble dome. They also

demonstrated that entrainment decreased rapidly with bubble size.

Two groups of Japanese investigators have also studied entrainment
due to jet drops. One group studied jet drop formation in water at
20% , 2.1% n-butylic acid (a pronounciational misprint no doubt) and
in 504 glycerin solution? . Contrary to the results of Garner et al.
glycerol and n-butyric acid solutions gave curves similar in form to
those from water, but the maximum rise height of the droplet was lower
then it was for water. The second group investigated the relationships
between bubble size, droplet sizes, and physical properties of the liquid,
particularly viscosity and surface tension’ 7, These data are presented
es graphs and equations in their publication. As they point out, how- .
ever, it is nearly impossible to vary only a single perameter (e.g.
surfece tension) without simultaneously changing enother (e.g. viscosity).
All these investigations have followed the formulation of Davies ®
in equating the vertical force P (2ynr) with the force on the mese of
liquid set in motion (mg). This leaves no room for the effect of vis-
cosity even though such an effect has been observed repeatedly” 5,36 .
(A viscosity effect might find its way into the constant in the empiricegl
equation in ref. 36.) It was recently pointed outl® that the impulse
force arising from the rupture of the bubble can be divided into two
parts involving inertial and viscous forces ‘and for water those are

approximately equal. The equations involved, however, are not partic

ularly amenable to direct solution, especially for s molten salt system.

Discussion

Table 1 lists physical constants for the systems investigated in
these publications and also the best values for the molten salt systems
we are interested in. The last two columns and three lines show the

effect of changing the temperature in water systems. This is seen to

have a large effect on the. jet drops; the effect on film drops (at dis-

- tances greater than 1 cm. from the surface of the liquid) is much less

marked. Raising the temperature by 20°C lowers the viscosity by 33%,

which one would expect to enhance Jet drop formation, yet it does not

~ seem to have as big an effect as simultaneously lowering the surface

“tension by only 4-1/2%. Nevertheless, since this lowers the number of

jet drops, it is not at all apparent, due to the high viscosity, that
bubbles in a molten salt will eject jet drops. We performed a few crude
experiments, catching Jet drops on a glass microscope slide at verying
heights from a molten salt (KNO3-LiN0s eutectic at 170-180%) solution;
and using a vibrating capillary to produce the bubbles't. Bubble sizes
were measured by combining photographic and microscopic techniques.

This solution behaves much like glycerin (see Fig. 4) and the relation
between bubble size, Jet drop size, and rise neight, is not sufficiently
different from the relation in water to make us suspicious of the
results.

It has been observed previously 2 that cover glasses over nitrate
melt become clouded with selt. It was postulated that this was due to
the ejection of microscopic droplets of salt ejected from bubbles of

oxygen generated by the reaction:
NOs ~ - NOo~ + 3 Oz.

We undertook to repeat this work using & physical arrangement which

would avoid the condensation of volatile impurities as a mechanism of

deposition. Five 2 ml beakers containing molten LiNOs-KNOs eutectic

were placed on a glass platform in a 400 ml. besker sustained at 185°C.

The nitrate melts contained, respectively: nothing else, NaNOz, H=0,
ENOs, end NeHCOg. All slides showed e fog; the slides covering the

H20 and HNO impurity melts showed a weight gain of 1 mg, the one

covering the NaNO impurity result gained only 0.2 mg. The other two

were chipped in handling and hence showed weight losses.

"This phenomenon appeared to be analogous to the volumetric evapor-

ation mentioned earlier?’ 40, We undertook to repeat the experiment,

~ this time using five beekers containing, respectively: no additive,

gold colloid, silver, a surface coating of talc, and a surface coating

of graphite. The same sort of results were obtained. The particles

were visible in the microscope, and were barely resolvable, thus
measuring sbout O.hy in diameter. None of the sdded materials seemed
to interfere with the deposit vhich was easily visible after a day.

The deposit over the carbon vas not gray, chemical analysis showed no
entrainment of the surface or colloidal materials. Using the Japanese
data as a guide, such droplets should arise from bubbles less than 5p
in diameter. Such bubbles, however, should be subjected to an extremely
high pressure (y/r) = 6 x 10% dynes/cm®) and should thus all go back
into the solution until the supersaturation becomes indeed. very high.
The question was resolved by en analysis of the main matrix material

which proved to be almost exclusively NH4NO3. The very slow volatiliza-

‘tion of this minor impurity should not be confused with the rapid

| volatilization required for volumetric evaporation.

posure to the air, the eutectic had absorbed enough water to turn to

- Conclusions

The production end behavior of drops from splashes and bubbles has
been reviewed and described. Possible application of these phenomena
to the MSRE pump bowl has been considered. |

There are three sorts of drops which can contribute to entrain-
ment in the MSRE, jet drops from splashes and from small recirculated
bubbles, film drops from the breakup of the film cap of larger bubbles
end crown drops from the breakup of the crown from splash drops. In
addition, there might be sa considerable direct aerosol formation due
to spray from the spray ring, but we have, at present, no way of

evaluating this. The gmount of salt available for entrginment from

+ these sources is much larger than that actually lost from the reactor,

hence most of the droplets must be returned somehow to the liquid stresm.

It has also been shown thet Jet drops can preferentially remove a
surface film from a molten salt surface. This surface microtome effect
may well be contributing to the apparent. loss of fission products to

the gas stream.
