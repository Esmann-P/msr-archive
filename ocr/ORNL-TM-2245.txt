REMOVAL OF XENON-135 FROM CIRCULATING FUEL SALT
BY MASS TRANSFER TO HELIUM BUBBLES

  

F. N. Peebles

c EE oo | © ABSTRACT

Removal of dissolved Yenon-135 by mass transfer to helium bubbles
offers. an attractive means of controlling the ‘Xenon-135 poison level
in molten salt breeder reactors (MSBR's). In order to provide neces-
sary engineering information for evaluation of the proposed method, the
existing dete on rates of mass ‘transfer to ges bubbles heave been: -
reviewed.

: Rather extensive literature references. point to reliable equations
for prediction of mass transfer rates to single bubbles, &ising in ~
stationary liquids under the two extreme cases of a rigid bubble inter-

- face end of a perfectly mobile bubble interface. In general, experi-
mentel deta are available which support these predictions. No reliable
criterion for predicting the transition from one type ‘behavior to
another is available.

An elementary analysis of the rates of mass transfer to bubbles
carried along by turbulent liquid in ea pipe is presented. The results
indicate that the bubble mass transfer coefficient for 0.02 in.
diemeter bubbles will be approximetely 13 ft/hr for mobile-interface
bubbles, end approximately 2 ft/hr for rigid-interface bubbles. An

experiment is suggested to provide specific data on the mass transfer
rates to bubbles carried along by turbulent liquid in. 8 pipe for hydro-
dynemic conditions which ‘simulete. the MSBR.

REMOVAL OF XENON-135 FROM CIRCULATING FUEL SALT OF THE MSBR
BY MASS TRANSFER TO HELIUM BUBBLES

1.0 Introduction

A proposed method? of removing Xenon-135 from the fuel salt in the
Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) involves circulation of helium bubbles
with the liquid fuel. Bubbles ere to be injected into the flowing stream

near the pump, and then dissolved Xenon-135 is removed from the liquid.

" by mass trensfer (combined diffusion and convection) into the bubbles.

‘The circulating bubbles are then to be removed from the liquid at the

outlet of the heat exchanger by a centrifugal separator.

Although the potential for Xenon-135 removal by mass transfer to
helium bubbles is high, the actuel effectiveness of removal is controlled
by the surface area of the bubbles exposed to the liquid and the mass
transfer coefficient between bubbles and liquid flowing cocurrently in.
a pipe. This report deels with the bubble mass transfer rate expected
under the MSBR operating conditions, based on the information available
in the literature, and a proposed experiment to provide additional data.
The experiment involves simuletion of the reactor flow and mass transfer
conditions through use of a glycerine solution es the liquid, oxygen as
the solute ges, and helium as-the stripping medium.

2.0 Mass Transfer Theory
The essential features of the mess transfer situestion of interest
is shown in Figure 1. Liquid flowing elong & pipe at the rate Q enters

the system with dissolved concentration, C.., and the inlet stripping gas

where Ce represents the local concentration of the solute gas in the
bulk bubble streem. Equation (1) is based on the case of negligible
solute gas in the inlet stripping ges.

At eny locetion slong the contactor, the concentration of dissolved
gas in the vicinity of the liquid-geas interface of & typical bubble is
depicted in Figure 2. The solute gas concentration difference between
that of the bulk liquid end the liquid et the interface provides the

driving force for mass transfer at the rate,

Equation (2) results from the classic assumption of negligible interfacial
resistance,’ and the assumption of small gas-phase resistence to mass
transfer. The latter assumption is en approximetion which is eppropriate
for the case of a. gas having a low solubility in the liquid of interest.

that the effectiveness for Xenon-135 removal is sharply related to the
liquid phese mess transfer coefficient in the range of 1 <K < 100 ft/hr.
Kea’ hes shown that the Xenon-135 poison fraction in the MSBR is
influenced in an importent way by the bubble stripping effectiveness, and"
hence successful reactor enelysis end design for the MSER depends on rether

accurate knowledge of the bubble mess transfer coefficient.

2.1 Mass Trensfer Coefficients for Sphericel Bubbles

Previous studies on mess trensfer to and from spherical ges bubbles
have been extensive, including enalyticel and experimental investigations.
A brief summery of the importent results is given in this section. First,
e description of the pertinent anelyticel model is presented and then a
summary of -the most recent experimental findings is given,

bubble surface because. the region of important concentration variation is
expected to be. thin, and even thinner than the region of significant velo-
city variations. Thus for such a situation it is reasonable to represent the
velocity in.the immediate vicinity of -the bubble surfece as

usu + uy. | (1)

The term u is the velocity component in the x-direction at the surface
of the epee, possibly non-zero since the sphere is fluid, and u' s is the
derivetive of the x-component of the velocity with respect to the normal
coordinate, y, and. evaluated at the bubble surface.

The tengentiel velocity component can be determined by integrating
the continuity equetion after making use of ¢ Equation (7. Thus it is
found that

In this formuletion, it is recognized that UW, end u ere functions of
the position along the bubble surface in the x-direction.
Upon use of Equations (7) and (8) in the diffusion equation, we find

that the solute gas concentration must satisfy the relation:

2
! oC 13 2 aC 9 °C
u u — — = —
( s + sy) x = = 3% [r(u oJ + a gv /2)] 3y PE (9)

Rether than proceeding with & general discussion of this equetion, we now
consider two limiting cases; nemely, the situation of a rigid interface with
ug equal to zero, and secondly the case of zero tangential stress at the
interface. The latter cease certainly is.relevent for gas bubbles in ea
liquid such that the liquid viscosity is meny times thet of the ges vis-

cosity. That the rigid interface situation is elso relevant constitutes

somewhat of & paradox, but it is known that smell ges bubbles do behave

to some extent as rigid spheres.

Teble I also includes results from the literature which desl with
the mobile interface situation. It is important to note that the mobile
interface results show that the mass transfer coefficient, expressed as
the non-dimensional Sherwood number: (x a, /D), varies with the Peclet
number (a, 0, /D) raised to the one-half power. In the case of the rigid
interface. bubble the Sherwood number veries with the Peclet number reised
to the one-third power. The higher power on the Peclet number gives rise
to significantly higher mess transfer coefficients for the xenon-135,
fuel salt system if the mobile interface bubble case is eppliceble.

The anelyticel results given in Teble I egree in general with those
obteined by other investigators. In 1935 Higbie'

contribution to the mess transfer literature in his enalysis of the rete

made an important

of ges ebsorption from bubbles rising in liquids. The enelysis was. based
on &a.mobile interface model and the assumption that the liquid surround-
ing a bubble is continuously replenished with fresh liquid es it rises

where te is the exposure time of the bubble to a given liquid envelope.
Then on the essumption that the liquid exposed to the liquis is renewed
each time thet the bubble moves through a height. equal to the bubble
diemeter, equation (19) is equivalent to:

Nop = 1.13 Np, (20)

Thus Higbie's result is identical to the mobile-interface equetion of
Boussinesq.>

Ruckensteint® hes also considered mass transfer between spherical
bubbles end liquids by solving the mess convection equations for various
hydrodynamic situations. In essence his development follows that pre-
sented here and the results for the extreme cases of the rigid interface
end the mobile interface agree rather well with the equations given in
Teble I. In particuler Ruckenstein found

the theoreticel mass transfer results presented previously, suggests that
low mess trensfer rates to bubble interfeces should prevail under these

2.3 Mess Transfer Coefficients for Bubbles Carried Along by Turbulent Liquid

The previous discussion of the mass transfer theory for ges bubbles
moving in a stationary liquid dealt with steady flows, end the results are.
most epproprietely applied to the. cases of freely rising bubbles or uniform.
flow of liquid past & bubble. In the MSBER injected helium bubbles would be
carried along by fuel salt flowing in e state of turbulent motion. - The
Reynolds number based on the heat exchanger tube diameter and bulk velocity
is expected to be ebout 8000. The following discussion of the mess trans-
fer for bubbles carried along by & turbulent liquid indicetes the approxi-
mate magnitudes of mass transfer coefficients.for this situation.

Hinze hes treated the case of relative motion between a small ges
bubble and & turbulent liquid, end for the limiting case of large inertia
forces in comparison to viscous forces he found that the bubble velocity

fluctuates with a lerger emplitude then the surrounding turbulent liquid;

namely
v= VE (26)

where \[v, eng f.Z ere r.m.s. values of the instantaneous bubble and
liquid velocities, respectively, for the turbulent motion. Equetion (26)
in essence results from integration of the equation for the fluctuating
motion of the gas bubble:

where 5 = bubble volume

Pps Py = bubble density, liquid density
k = added mass coefficient for accelerating spherical

t = time.

15

Thus, it is noted that since p << Py end k is 1/2,7” the bubble accelera-
tion is about three times the liquid acceleration. Upon use of Equation (26),
it is found that the velocity of the gas bubble relative to the turbulent .

1iquid motion on the average is:

Thus combination of Equations (28) and (29) indicates thet an estimate of

It seems reasoneble to use the result given by Equation (31) in the
mass trensfer equations for spherical particles to obtain the desired
relation for the mass transfer coefficient. The results obtained are given
for the two cases: (a) mobile gas-liquid interface and (b) rigid gas-
liquid interface.

migration of bubbles in a turbulent liquid is certainly affected by viscous.
dreg. This effect was not considered. Other important assumptions implicit
in the analysis are that the bubble is small compered to the scale of
turbulent motion and that the bubble moves in the same liquid envelope
during the course of each turbulent "event." These effects which cause
departure of the actual turbulent bubble motion from the assumed model
probably give rise to some attenuation of the bubble's fluctuation-
velocity amplitude, and, hence, the results given by Equations (33) and
(35) are likely optimistic. That is, the bubble's turbulent fluctuation
velocity mey be less then three times that of the liquid's fluctuation
velocity. In spite of the speculative nature of the assumptions made in
the analysis, the final equations give results which agree reasonably
well with the availeble experimental data.

A rather important point of the preceding enalysis is that the rela-
tive motion between bubbles end turbulent liquid gives rise to mass trans-

fer coefficients which ere appreciably greater than the mass trensfer

coefficients for "free-rise" (or "free-fell") flow conditions. This indi-

cation is supported by the experimental results of Harriott? for mass.
transfer coefficients between small rigid particles carried along by tur-
bulent liquid in & pipe. The experimental mass transfer results, ex-
pressed as the pipeline Sherwood number (x a/D), were correlated with
Reynolds number end Schmidt number by the equation

If one uses appropriate MSBR data (Neo =10", Ng, = 2880, D = 5 x 10
£t%/br, d = 0.305 in.), Equation (36) gives K_ = 1.3 ft/hr. Now if one

uses the rigid-interface mass transfer relation for a bubble with diameter
equal to 0.02 in. and rising in MSBR fuel salt, it is found that the mass
transfer coefficient for these conditions is 0.38 ft/hr. Thus, the pipeline
mess transfer coefficient may be 3 to LU times the value predicted for the
"free-rise" condition. Further, if an 0.02 in. diemeter bubble behaves

aes a mobile~interface particle, it is noted that the pipeline mass trans-
fer coefficient as predicted by Equation (33) is again about 3.6 times the

"free-rise' bubble mass transfer coefficient.

3.0 Proposed Mess Transfer Experiment to Simulate MSBR Contact Conditions.
The literature information on mass transfer to gas bubbles discussed
in the previous section does not yield e& firm estimate of the liquid phase
mass transfer coefficient expected for the MSBR flow conditions. Two
points need further clerification; nemely identification of the precise
criteria for rigid-interface and mobile-interface bubble behavior, and
determination of the mass transfer coefficients for bubbles carried by
turbulent liquid at the hydrodynemic conditions expected to prevail in the
MSBR. It seems that this information should be obtained by experimental
megsurements, in contrast to depending on further analytical investigation.
An experimental study of mass transfer rates in the detail to furnish
values of the liquid phase mass transfer coefficients carried out using
MSBR fuel salt would be a formidable and expensive undertaking. In con-
sidering these factors a more attractive alternative is to attempt
determination of the needed data using e suitable fluid which simuletes
the MSBR situation end which would not require tests et elevated tempera-
tures. Following is a brief description of a proposed experiment involving
the use of L6% glycerol, oxygen as the solute ges, and helium as. the
stripping medium in.order to simulate the MSBR hydrodynamic conditions,
The choice of the glycerol solution recommended for the mass trans-
fer tests is based on the requirements for dynemic similitude in the test
end MSER situations. Table II gives the importent factors that should be
neinteined dynemically similar in the model and prototype systems. Con-
sideration of these factors leads to the conclusion that the model experi-

ment should be carried out at the same Reynolds number (av, /v), bubble

retio (a, /4), Froude number (V  /4.8)> Schmidt number (v/D), Weber Number
(Va o/s, oc), pipe roughness ratio (e/d), and pipe length-to-diameter ratio
(L/d) as those values for the MSBR. It one decides to use the same bubble
diameter in the model and prototype situations, the similtude requirements
ere satisfied if the model experiment hes the same. pipe roughness, pipe
length, pipe diameter, kinematic viscosity, Schmidt number, and kinematic
surface tension as the MSBR.: The physical property requirements of equal
kinematic viscosity end Schmidt number cen be met approximately by using
L6% by weight glycerol. Figure 6 shows a plot of these physical properties
as & function of glycerol concentration. It should be noted that this test
liquid will not meet the kinematic surface tension requirement. In fact the
MSBR Weber number will be about 1.8 times thet for the 46% glycerol.

Oxygen seems to be an appropriate solute gas to be used in the pro-
posed mass transfer tests. The concentration of oxygen in glycerol can be
determined using the Winkleri® method end assay accuracies of tl per cent
are expected, based on the research of Jorden’ et al.

Other physical properties needed in the evaluation of mass transfer
coefficients from the experimental data are available.’ These include
the solubility data, oxygen diffusivity in glycerol solutions, glycerol
viscosity and density data.

Helium is recommended es & satisfactory stripping medium because of
its low solubility in glycerol and chemical inertness.

The mess transfer experiment proposed involves setting up the experi-
mental system diegremmed in Figure 7. Tests would be carried out by
establishing the MSER liquid flow rate in the test section. Helium bubbles
would be injected at a flow rate corresponding to that of the MSBR. Oxy-
gen concentrations in the inlet end effluent liquids would be determined
by chemical enalysis of liquid samples.

In order to evaluate the mass transfer coefficients, it would be
necessary to determine the bubble diemeters produced in the experimental
bubble generator. This probably cen be done by photographic methods.

The experimentel date on liquid oxygen concentrations at the inlet
end outlet points, gas and liquid flow rates, bubble diameter, test
section length, test temperature, end Henry's law coefficient would be
used with Equation (3) to determine the liquid phase mass transfer

4.0 Conclusions

The study of existing literature on mass transfer between bubbles
end liquids and the analysis presented in the previous sections permits the
following conclusions:

1. The effectiveness for Xenon-135 removal from the circulating
fuel salt in the MSBR may range from about 3 to 33 per cent depending on.
the value of liquid phase mass transfer coefficient. The estimated
Xenon-135 removel effectiveness is based on the range of mass transfer
coefficients, 1 to 13.5 ft/hr., obteined from aveileble literature informa-
tion. -

2. Availeble literature informstion provides a good basis for
estimeting mass trensfer coefficients for bubbles moving at & steady.

velocity relative to liquid under conditions of a rigid interface and

e completely mobile interface.

3. There does not exist a relieble criterion for specifying the
type of bubble interface condition expected for & given condition.

L. The available literature does not provide a good basis of
estimating the mass transfer coefficient for bubbles carried slong by
turbulent liquid. Anelysis of this situation in spproximate terms pro-
vided new reletionships which are. in approximate agreement with the dete
that are available.

5. New mass transfer measurements are proposed to provide additional
data needed in overcoming the limitations for mass transfer predictions
cited in Conclusions 3 end 4. Glycerol (46% by weight) is recommended as
the test fluid in order to simulate the MSBR hydrodynamic conditions and.

meet most of the requirements for dynamic similitude in the model and

prototype situations.
