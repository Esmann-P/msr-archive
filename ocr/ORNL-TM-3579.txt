' DESIGN AND COST STUDY OF A
FLUORINATTON--REDUCTIVE EXTRACTION--METAL
“TRANSFER PROCESSING FLANT FOR THE VSER

Ww. IL. Carter E. L. Nicholson
ABSTRACT

A preliminary design study and cost estimate were made
for an integrated processing plant to continuously treat
irradiated LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, fuel salt from a 1000-Mi(e).

single-fluid, molten-salt breeder reactor, The salt is

treated by the fluorination--reductive extraction--metal
transfer process to recover and recycle uranium and carrier
salt, to isolate %33pa for decay, and to concentrate fis-
sion products in waste media, For a plant that processes
the active inventory (1683 £2) of reactor fuel on a 10-day
cycle the direct costs were estimated to be $21 million and
indirect costs were $15 million for a total investment of
$36 million. Allowances for site, site preparation, and
buildings plus facilities shared with the reactor are not
included since these costs are included in the overall cost
of the power station, . The net fuel cycle cost for process-
ing on a 10-day cycle at 80% plant factor was estimated to

‘be 1.1 mills/kWhr; this includes credit for a 3.3%/yr yield

of bred fuel, The capital investment was not strongly in-
fluenced by processing rate. A plant to process the 1000-
Mi(e) reactor on a 3,3-day cycle was estimated to cost $48
million,

A 0.9-gpm stream of fuel salt Flows directly from the

‘reactor to the processing plant, and, after about 30 min-

utes holdup for decay of short-lived fission products, the
salt flows to a fluorinator where approximately 95%.of the
uranium is removed, The salt is then contacted with bis-

-muth containing metallic lithium reductant to extract **°Pa

and the remaining uranium, which are hydrofluorinated from
the bismuth into a captive salt phase and held for ***Pa
decay, The U- and Pa-free salt is treated in a second ex-
tractor with additional Bi-Ii solution to remove most of
the rare earth fission products which are isolated via the
metal transfer operation in Bi-Ii alloys and held for decey.

© Finally, the rare earths are hydrofluorinated into a waste

salt for disposal,

Fuel salt is reconstitued by reducing recycle UF from
the fluorinator directly into the purified LiF-BeF,-ThF,

carrier, Gaseous reaction products (HF and excess °H,) from
UF, reduction are treated to remove volatile fission products
and recycled, A portion of the HF is electrolyzed to provide
Fp for fluorination,

 
 

 

- Reductive extraction and metal transfer operations are
carried out at about 640°C; fluorination and hydrofluorina-
tion can be conducted at 550-600°C. Molybdenum is the
assumed construction material for vessels that contained.
molten bismuth and bismuth-szlt mixtures; Hastelloy N was .
used for vessels containing only molten fluoride salt.

SUMMARY

‘An essential objective of the design &nd developmental effort on. &
molten salt breeder reactor (MSER) is satisfactory and economic reproc-
essing method for the irradiated fuel, As processing development advances
in the laboratory and on an engineering scale, it is informative to relate
the conceptual process to the operation of the reactor and to the cost of
producing power, We have made a preliminary design and cost estimate for
a processing plant that uses the fluorination--reductive extraction--metal
transfer process to determine capital investment and fuel cycle costs,
Our study was for an integrated processing facility for treating irradi-
. ated LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, fuel from a single-fluid, 1000-MW(e) MSER on a
10-day cycle, The estimated capital and fuel cycle costs are:

The costs are for installed process equipment, piping, instrumentation,
thermal insulation, electrical supply, sampling stations, and various |
auxiliary equipment including pumps, electricel heaters, refrigeration
system, and process gas supply and purification systems, The estimate

does not include site, site preparation, and building costs or the cost

of facilities and equipment shered with the reactor plant; these costs

are included in the overall cost of the power station, Installed spare
equipment and redundant cooling circuits for fail-safe design. are also
not included, Molybdenum was the assumed construction material for all
equipment that contained bismuth or bismuth-salt mixtures; Hastelloy N

was used for vessels that contained only molten salt,

Irradiated fuel is removed continuously from the reactor and held
about 30 minutes for decay of short-lived fission products (see Fig. 1).
Most of the uranium is then removed by fluorination and is quickly re-
cycled by reduction with hydrogen into previously processed salt that is
returning to the reactor. The salt is then contacted in an extraction
column with bismuth containing about 0,2 at.% lithium metal and 0.25 at.%
thorium metal reductants to extract ‘protactinium, zirconium, and the
remaining uranium, The uranium- and protactinium-free salt flows to a
second extraction column where a large portion of the rare earths, al-
kaline earths, and alkali metal fission products are extracted by further
contact with Bi-Li reductant. Some thorium is also extracted, The salt
is then reconstituted with recycle and makeup uranium, treated to remove
entrained bismuth, corrosion products, and suspended particulates. The
wert concentration ratio is adjusted and the salt is returned to the
reactor. |

The bismuth effluent from the first extraction column is hydroflu-
orinated in the presence of recirculating LiF-ThF, -ZrF, -PaF, salt to
oxidize 233Pa, uranium, and zirconium to soluble fluorides which dissolve
in the salt; unused lithium and thorium reductants also transfer to the
salt, The clean bismuth receives makeup reductant and returns to the
process. Protactinium-233 is isolated from the rest of the process in
- the salt phase and held for decay. To avoid a large uranium inventory,

the protactinium decay salt is fluorinated on a one-day cycle, and,

every 220 days, about 25 ft® of the salt is withdrawn, held for 233Pa
decay, fluorinated, and discarded to purge accumulated fission products,

LiF, ThF,, and some corrosion products, The F,-UFg stream from this

-fluorinator contains uranium of the highest isotopic purity in the proc-

essing plant; therefore, a portion of this stream is withdrawn to remove

excess uranium above that required to refuel the reactor,

Fission products removed from the carrier salt in the second extrac-
tion column are transferred from Bi-Ii solution to molten lithium chloride;
however, the distribution coefficient for thorium between LiCl and Bi-Ii
solution is much lower than that of the rare earths and very little tho-
rium transférs, The lithium chloride circulates in a closed loop, and
is treated in two steps to isolate the rare earths and alkaline earths,

The entire LiCl stream is contacted with Bi-5 at,% Li alloy to strip

trivalent rare earths into the metal; about two percent of this treated

. stream is then stripped with Bi-50 at.% Li alloy to remove divalent rare

earths and alkaline earths, Alkali metals (rubidium, cesium) remain in

the lithium chloride and are removed by occasionally discarding a small

volume of the salt, Fission products build up in the two Bi-Li alloys

and are purged periodically by hydrofluorinating relatively small volumes
of each alloy in the presence of a molten waste salt,

Large fractions of some classes of fission products (noble gases,
noble and seminoble metals) are presumed to be removed from the fuel salt
in the reactor, and, for these, the processing plant is not designed to
handle the MSBR's full production, Noble ‘gases are sparged from the .
circulating fuel in the reactor with inert gas on a 50- sec cycle, and
noble and seminoble metals are expected to plate out on reactor and heat
exchanger surfaces on a relatively short cycle. A removal cycle time of
2.4 hours was used for this study. .Since this cycle is short compared
to 10-day processing cycle time, only about 0.1% of ‘these metals are
removed in the processing plant. Halogenous fission products are vola-
tilized in fluorination and are removed from the process gas by scrubbing

with aqueous caustic solution after uranium has been recovered,

The capital cost for the flucrination--reductive extraction--metal

transfer processing plant is not strongly affected by ‘throughput, The

 
 

direct, indirect, and total plant investments were $28.5 million, $20,041
million, and $48,541 million respectively for a plant to process a 1000-
MW (e) MSBR on a 3.33-day cycle, The scale factor for capital cost versus
throughput is 0.28 for a range of processing cycle times from 3 to 37 days.

Although considerable knowledge has been gained in recent years on
processing molten fluoride salts, the current concept still has a number
of ‘major uncertainties and problem areas that must be resolved. to prove
‘its practicability, From a chemical standpoint, the process is funda-
mentally sound; however, engineering: problems ere difficult, A basic
problem is a material for containing bismuth and bismuth-salt mixtures;
molybdenum has excellent corrosion resistance, but the technology for
fabricating complex shapes and systems is undeveloped, Graphite is a
possible alternate material, however, its use introduces design and fab-
rication difficulties particularly in joint design and porosity. =
Fluorination of a flowing salt streom has been demonstrated but establish-
ing and maintaining a protective layer of frozen salt on the fluorinator
walls has not been demonstrated except in a fluorination simulation,
Complete removal of entrained bismuth from molten salt, and satisfactory
high-temperature instrumentation for process control are yet to be de-
veloped and demonstrated. Experimental data from the MSRE indicate that
noble metal fission products will deposit on reactor surfaces as we have
assumed in this study; if this is not the case, there will be a consider-
able effect on processing plant design in facilities for handling these

additional fission preducts,
SCOPE OF THE DESIGN STUDY

This design and cost study was made to estimate the cost of proc-
essing irradiated LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, fuel of a 1000-MW(e) molten-salt
breeder reactor, The processing plent is an integrated facility that

shares common services and maintenance equipment with the reactor and

power conversion plant, Fuel is treated continuously by the fluorination--

reductive extraction--metal transfer process.

Our costs are based upon preliminary design calculations of each
major item of process equipment, A sufficient study was made of all
process operations to establish the geometry, heat transfer surface,
material of ‘construction, coolant requirement, and other features that
influenced operability and cost of the equipment. - No plant layouts or

designs of auxiliary equipment were made, Auxiliary items such as pumps,

sampling stations, reagent purification sy stems, etc. , were identified

by size and number in relatively broad categories from flowsheet require-
ments and a general knowledge of the overall plant layout. The costs of
major equipment items were estimated on the basis of unit cost per pound

of fabricated material for the required shapes, for example, plate, tubing,

pipe, flanges, ete, The costs of conventional auxiliary equipment and

off-the-shelf items were estimated from previously developed molten salt

reactor project information,

Estimated costs for major and auxiliary equipment were the basis
for other direct costs that could not be determined without detailed
designs and equipment layouts, Cost for piping, instrumentation, insula-
tion, etc.,, were estimated by taking various percentages of the installed
equipment costs, The applied factors were obtained from previous experi-

ence in chemical processing plant design and construction,

The study does not include allowances for site, site preparation,
buildings, and facilities shared with the reactor plant, These costs
are identified with the overall cost of the power station and it is not
practicable to prorate them over various sections of the installation.

Facilities and equipment for treating the reactor off-gas are usually

considered to be part of the reactor system and their cost was not in-

cluded, Furthermore, our study was not sufficiently detailed to determine
the required duplication of equipment for continuity of operations, nor
did we make a thorough safety analysis that could result in additional

cost, ‘especially with regard to redundant and fail-safe coolant circuits.

A more detailed study than ours might also show that additional equipment
. is needed to treat fuel and/or reactor coolant salt : in case of accidental

cross contamination,

 
 

 

For consistency with the cost study for the reference molten-salt
breeder reactor,® we have based our costs on the 1970 value of the
dollar, Private ownership of the plant is assumed, Interest on borrowed
“money for the three-year construction period is taken at 8% per year; no

"escalation of costs during construction is taken into account, Costs of: oo

- site, buildings, facilities and services, and reactor off-gas treatment

may be found in reference 1.
"THE MOLTEN SALT BREEDER REACTOR

Reactor Plant

The processing plant of this study treats irradiated fuel from the
1000-MW(e) reference molten salt breeder reactor described by Robertson, *
The single-fluid reactor is fueled with 233yF, in a carrier of molten
71iF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12 mole %); about 0.3 mole % **3UF, is required
for criticality. The molten fuel is circulated at high velocity in
‘closed loops consisting of the reactor core and primary heat exchangers
(Fig. 2) where fission energy is transferred to a secondary coolant salt
for the production of supercritical steam at 1000°F and 3600 psia.

: Fissioning uranium in the core heats the salt to about 1300°F; this tem-
perature is reduced to about 1050°F in the primary heat exchangers from
which the salt returns to the core to repeat the cycle. A sidestream of

s&lt flows continuously through the fuel-salt drain tank, and & very small

portion (0,87 gpm) of this stresm is routed continuously to the processing
plant for treatment. Processed salt is returned to the drain tank and
then to the reactor. |

‘A few pertinent data about the MSER are given in Table 1.

Fuel Salt

In a single-fluid MSBR the fertile material (thorium) is carried in. }

‘bred fuel is burned to produce power; however, excess *°°U amounting to
about 3.27% of the reactor inventory is produced each year end is recov-

processing plant design because of its high specific decay heat (50.8

. and seminoble metals which appears to attach themselves to surfaces in

11

A thermal-neutron reactor must be processed rather rapidly for both
fission product and 233Pa removal if the reactor is to maintain favorable
breeding characteristics, and a significant advantage of the MSBR is the
ease of withdrawing fuel for processing, The moderately high absorption
cross section and large equilibrium inventory (~102 kg) of *3°Pa make
this nuclide a significant neutron poison and require that its removal
rate by processing be about four (or more) times its decay rate, that is,

a cycle time of gbout 10 days, In this system the processing plant is

an integral part of the installation, and irradiated fuel can flow easily
from the primary reactor circuit to the processing plant (Fig. 1). Treated
fuel is returned in a similar manner, The processing cycle time is de-
termined from an economic balance between the cost of processing and the
credit from increased fuel yield. The cycle time for this study (10 days)

‘might not be the optimum because it was fixed to give the MSBR favorable

nuclear performance without prior knowledge of the processing cost.

Contaminants in the reactor fuel can be grouped into three broad |

categories with respect to their influence on processing plant design:?

(1) volatile fission products, (2) soluble fission and corrosion products,

and (3) fission products that have an affinity for surfaces in the reactor

sy stem. The first group includes the noble gases which are removed from
the reactor primary system on about a 50-sec cycle by sparging the circu-
lating fuel with an inert gas, Therefore, these gases are only a minor
consideration in the design of the processing plant. Experimental evi-
dence suggests that portions of the noble metal fluorides might also be
removed by sparging, but the data are inconclusive in establishing the
magnitude of this effect. ~The second group of fission products has the
most effect on processing plant design because their only means of re-
moval is by processing the fuel salt, These fission products include
primarily the halogens, alkali metals, alkaline earths, and rare earths;

protactinium (as PaF, is also soluble and a very important nuclide in
w/g) and large equilibrium inventory. The third group includes the noble

the reactor circuit, These metals are called "noble" because they are

 
 

12

noble with respect to the materials of construction of the reactor and
© are normally in the reduced state in this system, The effective cycle
time for this removal is not definitely known but is believed to be
bout 2.1; hr, the removal time used in this study, This group of fission
products accounts for sbout 304 of the total fission product decay heat,
hence noble metals could become an important factor in processing plant

: design if their removel in the reactor is not £8 ‘efficient as we have

 

assumed, or if they build up deposits that occasionally break away and
enter the processing plant. Co ~

Equilibrium Composition of the MSER

The equilibrium composition of the 1000-MiW(e) MSER has been calcu-
lated by Bell® for use in this study and the results gre given in Teble 2.
The fission product values are the sum of individual values for every
isotope of the particular fission product. At equilibrium, B + y heat
generation by fission products is 9, 9 MW, which is 4,,08% of the total
thermal power,

Protactinium is processed on a 10-day cycle and held for decay in
the processing plant, The 233Pa inventory distribution between the
reactor and the processing plant is 20,6 kg and 81.8 kg respectively,

Most of the fission products are removed from the fuel salt by
several mechanisms, and the processing cycle time for each given in the
table is for the dominant removal process. However, all removal proc-
esses were considered in computing the equilibrium composition, for
.example, neutron absorption, plating out on reactor surfaces, extraction .
in the processing plant, fuel salt discard, or any Other spplicsble
method,

BEHAVIOR OF FISSION PRODUCTS AND
FUEL SALT COMPONENTS IN PROCESSING

removal, This relationship is shown in Table 3, All chemical species
in the fuel salt can be divided into twelve groups, the members of each
group having similar behavior in the processing plant, The primary re-
moval operation is the dominant process for the group; whereas, the

‘secondary removal operation is a downstream operation designed for

removal of a different group but also effective in removing components

of a previously removed group.

Noble gases, seminoble metals, and noble metals have only a small
influence on processing plant design because of their fast removal rate
in the reactor. However, soluble daughters of these nuclides will prob-
ably reenter the fuel salt and be removed in the processing plant.

Noble gases are sorbed from the inert sparge gas and retained for decay

on charcoal beds in the reactor off-gas circuit that is removed from the

processing plant, "Decay times are sufficient to decontaminate the gas

from all krypton and-xenon. isotopes except 85Kr, which has a 10, 76-yr
half life, Krypton-85 is concentrated and stored in cylinders by routing
a sidestream of the carrier gas through either a cryogenic operation .or

the more recently developed hydrocarbon sorption process.

There are small concentrations of heavy elements (neptunium and
protactinium) formed by neutron capture and decay. These elements are
easily extracted and will be held in the 253pa decay tank, Neptunium
can be fluorinated from the salt but not as easily as uranium; therefore,
we can expect part of the ‘neptunium to behave like uranium and be returned

to the. reconstituted fuel,

THE FLUORINATION--REDUCTIVE
EXTRACTION: -MBTAL TRANSFER PROCESS

A simplified flowsheet of the fluorination--reductive extraction--

metal transfer process is shown in Fig, 3. The plant can ‘be divided into

six areas each of which is characterized by its primary process operation:

fluorination, protactinium extraction and isolation, rare earth extraction

‘and metal transfer, fuel reconstitution, gas recycle, and waste accumu-

lation. Fuel salt flows quickly through the plant so that there is

minimal holdup of salt and uranium,

Fluorination

Irradiated fuel salt from the MSER enters the processing plant at

about 0.87 gal/min and is held for gbout 30 minutes to allow the decay
heat generation rate to drop from about 54.6 to 12,6 ki/ft3, (See the
detailed flowsheet in Appendix D for material.and energy ‘balance data.)
The salt then flows to a fluorinator where sbout 95% of the uranium is
volatilized at gbout 550°C as UF. The fluorinator must be protected }
from catastrophic attack by the Fy-molten' salt mixture by a layer of
frozen salt on wetted surfaces of the unit, ‘salt leaves the fluorinator
and enters e similer column, which is also protected by frozen salt,
where hydrogen gas reacts with dissolved fluorine end UF, to produce HF
. and UF, respectively. The hydrogen also strips HF from the salt, prevent-
ing corrosion of downstream equipment.

The fluorinator is also the primary removal unit for the halogens,
which are oxidized to volatile BrF, and IF,, Certain noble &nd semi-
noble metals, namely, Se, Mo, Tc, Ru, Sb, and Te, are converted to
volatile fluorides by fluorine and are removed with the uranium, How- ~
ever, as stated above, the equilibrium amounts of these metals in the
salt are small because of the 2,k-hr removal time in the reactor, Resid-
ual Kr and Xe are removed by the stripping action of Fy in the fluorinator

and H, in the purge column,

The principal reactions are:

Protactirium Extraction and Isolation

The salt stream, containing about 5% of the uranium and all of the
protactinium, enters the bottom of .a packed extraction column and is

contacted with a countercurrent stream of bismuth containing about 0,2

at, % lithium and 0,25 at, % thorium reductants, Protactinium and ura-

nium are reduced by lithium and thorium and extracted into the bismuth;
fission “product zirconium, the remaining noble and seminoble metals, and
corrosion products are also extracted, Salt leaving the top of the ex-

traction column is essentially free of uranium and protactinium,

The reductive extraction column operates at about 640°C with a salt/
metal flow ratio around 6,7/1, Extraction is essentially complete for

the affected nuclides, Thorium can be extracted into the metal as shown

in the third equation below, However, operating conditions are fixed to

minimize the extraction of thorium, and, since thorium is a reductant
for protactinium and uranium, it is partially returned to the salt phase.
The principal reactions occurring in the protactinium extraction column
are: -

PaF, (sglt) + L Li(Bi) - L LiF (salt) + Pa(Bi)

UF, (salt) + L Ti(Bi) -+ lj IiF (salt) + U(Bi)

ThF, (salt) + L Li(Bi) - L LiF (salt) + Th(Bi)

UF, (salt) + Th(Bi) - ThF, (salt) + U(Bi)

PaF, (salt) + Th(Bi) - ThF, (salt) + Pa(Bi)

 2rF, (salt) + lL Li(Bi) - L LiF (salt) + Zr(Bi)

Corresponding reactions between BeFp and Ii(Bi) or Th(Bi) do not occur,

As shown in the above reactions, reductive extraction increases the LiF

content of the carrier salt. The excess is removed by discarding a

small amount of the carrier in a later operation,

 

Protactinium Isolation Ysten

The metal stream from. the reductive extraction column enters a
hydrofluorinator where all nuclides dissolved in the bismuth are oxidized
to fluorides with HF gas at about 640°C in the presence of LiF-ThF,-
ZrF,-PaF, (71,00-25,97-2,84-0.19 mole #) salt. The oxidized materials
transfer to the salt, A minuscule stream (0,6 gal/day) of Bi-Li alloy

 
 

20
from the divalent rare earth accumulation system also enters the hydro-
fluorinator. Fission products and lithium in this stream are &lso
converted to fluorides which transfer to the salt, A clean bismuth
stream leaves the hydrofluorinator. . Part of it is reconstituted with
lithium reductant and returned to the rare earth removal system; the
remainder is made into Bi-50 at, $ Ii alloy for the divalent rare earth
accumulation system,

The protactinium isolation system consists of & 150-ft° volume of
LiF-ThF,-ZrF,-PaF, salt circulating in a closed loop consisting of the

 hydrofluorinator, fluorinator, purge column, and *3*Pa decay tank, The

 

system has no direct communication with areas of the plant handling fuel
salt, making it an effective safeguard against the accidental return of
large quantities of ®3®Pa or fission products to the reactor, At equi-
‘1ibrium about 81.8 kg *>3Pa, which is 80% of the plent inventory, is in
the 233Pa isolation system, This system is the largest source. ‘of decay
heat, generating gbout 4.1 MA of 233Pg decgy heat and 1,7 MA of fission =
product decay heat,

Steady state concentrations are esteblished for the components of
the system by regulating their removal rate, Uranium is removed by
fluorinating the salt immediately. upon leaving the hydrofluorinator,
most of the UF, being sent directly to the UF, reduction unit for recom-
bination with fuel carrier salt. Excess uranium above that needed to
refuel the reactor is withdrawn at this point, The entire volume of
salt is fluorinated on a one-day cycle so that the uranium inventory is

gbout that from one day's decay of the 2*>Pa inventory (~2,6 kg 0).

The volume of salt in the protactinium decay system slowly increases -
due to the addition of fission products, lithium, and thorium in the
: hydrofluorinator, The volume is allowed to build up to 175 £42; then a
25-£3 batch is withdrawn and the cycle is repeated,” The calcilated
cycle time is 220 days. This periodic discard of salt purges fission
products and establishes the composition of the system, Discarded salt
is held for %33Pa decay, fluorinated, and sent to waste,

Rare Barth Extraction and Metal Transfer

Uranium- and protactinium-free salt from the protactinium extraction

- column enters the bottom of a second extraction column and is contacted

with Bi-0,2 at, % 1i-0.25 at, % Th alloy to extract some of the rare
earths, alkaline earths, and alkali metals, Effective cycle times (see
Table. 2) range from about 16 days for barium, strontium, and cerium to

51 days for europium; the effective cycle time for all elements is about
25 days, Thus, extraction efficiencies range from 20 to 60% for individ-
ual elements, About 2, gal/day of the treated salt is discarded to

maintain a lithium balance on the system, BeF,-ThF, makeup is added, and

the salt is sent to the UF, reduction unit for fuel reconstitution,
Excess lithium enters the carrier salt in the reductive extraction oper-

ations.

* Metal Transfer to LiCl

 

"The bismuth stream containing fission products flows to another
packed column where it is contacted with LiCl at about 640°C, Fission
products transfer from the metal to the salt. Although some thorium is
extracted from the fluoride salt with the rare earths, only a very small
amount of thorium trensfers to the chloride salt; thus, large separation
factors are achieved between thorium and rare earths, Separation factors
for Th/RE®* and Th/RE®* are as large as 10% and 10° respectively.'® The

LiCl salt is a captive volume of 20 £1%; fission products build up to

steady state concentrations determined by their decay rates and removal

rates in the two rare earth strippers. It is believed that the alkali

‘metals, rubidium and cesium; will remain in the LiCl salt, and a 15-yr

discard cycle has been assumed to purge these fission products,

‘At steady state, the LiCl salt contains about ©,31 at, % rubidium,

1.36 at, % cesium, 0,29 at, % divalent rare earths and alkaline earths,
and 0, 00C% at, % trivalent rare earths, The heat generation is about
15.2 h/ 28

 
 

 

22

Rare Earth Stripping

Rare earths and alkaline earths are continuously stripped from LiCl
by passing the salt countercurrent to Bi-Li alloys containing high Li
concentrations in two packed columns as shown in Fig, 3. The entire
salt stream flows through one contactor in which trivalent rare earths
‘and a small amount of divalent rare earths are stripped into Bi-S at, &
"Ii alley by reduction with lithium, About two percent of the salt from
this column is diverted to a second column where divalent rare earths
and alkaline earths ere stripped into Bi-50 at, % lithium alloy. The
-divalent species are more difficult to strip end require the higher
lithium concentration, Salt streams from the two columns ere recombined
and returned to the primary extractor completing the cycle,

Trivalent fission products are held for decay in the metal and sent

to waste by semicontinuously hydrofluorinating small batches of the Bi-Li-

fission product solution in the presence of waste salt, The divalent -
nuclides are purged via the protactinium decay system by periodically
hydrofluorinating batches of the metal in the presence of the circulating
protactinium decgy salt, This mode of operation also serves to add
lithium to the protactinium decay salt, a necessary requirement to
maintain an acceptably low-melting composition (liquidus temperature.
~568°C). = Equilibrium concentrations of REY and RE?* in bismuth of
the trivalent stripper system are about 0.46 at, % and 0,013 at, %
respectively; corresponding values in the divalent stripper system are
~ gbout 0,19 at, % and 0,96 at, %. About 27 ft> of Bi-5 at, $ lithium

Chemical Reactions in Reductive Extraction and Metal Transfer

 

We can more easily understand the reductive extraction--metel trans-
fer process by summarizing the reactions that occur at each step, - Using
a trivalent rare earth as an example, we obtain for

reactions, we find that the net effect is to transfer a RE°* atom from
the fuel salt to a waste fluoride salt and to add three lithium atoms to
the fuel salt. Also 1.5 molecules of H, gas are produced,

Fuel Reconstitution

After removal of rare earths, the fuel salt is reconstituted with

recycled uranium in the reduction column, The UF,-F, mixture is absorbed

in UF, -bearing selt and contacted with hydrogen reductant at about 600°C

forming UF, directly in the molten salt, Wetted surfaces of the column
are protected from corrosive attack by a layer of frozen salt, Gaseous
reaction products, primarily hydrogen and hydrogen fluoride, are contam-
inated by small amounts of volatile fission products, principally compounds
I, Br, Se, and Te. It is believed that most of the volatile noble metal
fluorides accompanying the UF, will be reduced to metals in the reduction
column and remain in the salt. However, the fluorides of I, Br, Se, and

‘Te will probably be reduced to HI, HBr, H,Se, and H,Te, compounds that

are very volatile, The gas is treated to remove fission products and .

recycled.

Small amounts of noble gases, formed by decay in the processing
plant, would be removed from the salt at this point,

Metal Reduction and Bismuth Removal

Reconstituted fuel salt flows to a second gas/liquid contactor where
it is treated with hydrogen gas to reduce corrosion products to metals,

to reduce some of the UF, to UF;, and to strip. any residual HF from the

 

 
 

 

 

2h

salt. Since there might be entrained bismuth in the salt, the stream is =~
"passed through a bed of nickel wool for bismuth removel, Bismuth must
be removed before fuel enters the reactor circuit because of its reactiv-

ity with nickel-base alloys of which the reactor is constructed.

 

Filtration and Valence Adjustment

Reduced metal particulates are filtered from the salt and, if nec-
essary, a further treatment with hydrogen reductent is made to obtain
the proper U°*/U** ratio, The salt then enters a feed tank, which holds
about a 30-min supply of fuel, where occasional samples are taken for

‘laboratory analysis. The processed fuel then returns to the reactor,

Gas Recycle

Process gases used in MSBR salt processing are treated to remove
fission products and recycled. -Mixtures of H,-HF from the UFy reduction
column, sparge columns, and hydrofluorinators are compressed to about
two atmospheres pressure and cooled to liquefy HE which is then distilled
at essentially total reflux to separate more volatile fission product
compounds (primarily HI, HBr, and probebly H,Se and H,Te) from hydrogen
fluoride, The condenser for the still is kept at -LO°C to minimize the
loss of hydrogen fluoride. A portion of the HF is recycled to the hydro-:
fluorinators and the remainder is electrolyzed in a fluorine cell to make
Fp and H,, which are reused in the fluorinators and sparge columns re-

spectively.

- Halogen Removal

~ The hydrogen stream containing the volatile fission products passes
through a potassium hydroxide scrub solution to remove hydrogen bromide,
hydrogen iodide, and the equilibrium quantity of hydrogen fluoride, |
Selenium and tellurium compounds are not expected to react with the °
caustic solution, but pass out with the effluent hydrogen. About 20 ft°
of solution is required to maintain a tolerable specific heat generation
rate, which, at steady state, is about 210 kW, primarily from iqdine decay.
The solution is recycled through the scrub column until the KOH concentra-
tion decreases from 10M to 0.5M; then it is evaporated to a solid waste

~and stored.

Noble Metal and Noble Gas Removal

 

Most of the hydrogen stream is dried in regenerative silica gel
units and recycled to the UFg reduction column, However, sbout five
percent is withdrawn to purge volatile selenium and tellurium compounds
and noble gases, The stream passes through granular, activated alumina
for sorption of selenium and tellurium (probebly H,Se and H,Te) and
through charcoal. for sorption of krypton and xenon, The purified hydrogen

is vented to the stack,
Waste Accumulation

Fluoride Salt Waste:

Most of the waste is withdrawn from the process at four points and.
accumulated as a molten fluoride salt in retention tanks, - Two of the
streams are Bi-Li alloy solutions containing divalent and trivalent rare
earths, and two are fluoride salt streams, one from the 233py decay sys-
tem and one from barren fuel carrier discard. The divalent rare earths
are hydrofluorinated into the 233Pa decay salt semicontinuously and re-
moved when 25 ft batches of the salt are discarded and combined with

_ fuel carrier sdlt discard. The trivalent rare earths are hydrofluorin- -

ated into combined protactinium discard salt and fuel cerrier discard,
The total waste volume is about 92,5 ft> every 220 operating days. The

batch is then fluorinated to recover traces of uranium that might have

entered the waste from a process inefficiency, and sent. to a waste accu-

mulation tank, Waste is accumulated for six batches (gbout L.5 calendar
years) and set aside to decay an additional 9 years before permanent

disposal.

The composition and heat generation in a filled waste tank is given

in Table L, and a decay curve for the fission products is shown in Fig, L.

Waste From Gas Recycle System

Wastes generated in the gas recycle system come from the neutrali-
zation of fission product bromine and iodine in KOH solution, the

changing of the alumina and electrolyte is required. However, about

20 ft® of caustic solution must be evaporated to & solid residue every

34 days. Condensate from the evaporation is reused to make fresh KOH

. solution, A L5-dzy decay period is necessary before evaporation so that
intolerable temperatures in the ceke cen be avoided, The waste is eveap-
orated and shipped in the largest permissible container (2 ft 0D x10 ft

(Fig. 3), it is seen that only three waste streams routinely leave the
plant--a fluoride waste salt from the large retention tanks, the evap-
"orator residue from the KOH scrubber, end the hydrogen discard stream
from the gas recycle system, The only one of these waste areas into
which very small amounts of uranium and/or protactinium normally flow
is the large fluoride salt waste tank,

Fluoride Salt Waste

The 220- -day holdup of combined 23%Ps decay salt and carrier salt
discard allow &bout 99, 6% of the ®3°Pa to decay, and. the subsequent
batch fluorination can recover &ll but about 1 ppm ***T in the salt
without difficulty, There are sbout 10,023 kg of waste salt in the

batch so that the ®33U remaining is approximately 10 grams, Undecayed
233Pa is an additional L5.g, making about 55 g of unrecovered fissile
material in the salt sent to waste retention, Since the excess 2337
production is sbout 165 g/day, the urirecovered material (55 g/220 days)
represents only 0.15% of the breeding gein, However, the waste salt is
held in the large retention tank for 9 years after filling before ship-
‘ment to permanent disposal, At the end of this time (13,5 years) the
salt can be fluorinated again to recover &ll.but 1 ppm 2°3U from the -
batch, Thus, only about 60 g *2°U would remain in the final waste, being
. an insignificant loss of. about 0. 007L% of the breeding gain,

KOH Scrubber Waste

The probability of uranium loss via the KOH scrubber--evaporator
waste is extremely small, Before UFg can reach the caustic scrubber it
must pass through three unit operations in series that are very effective
at removing UFg: first, the primary UF,-to-UF, reduction unit must fail
to function properly thereby allowing UF; to enter the ges recycle system;
secondly, NaF sorbers, installed as & safeguard egainst such a malfunction,
would have to be ineffective at trapping the UFg;. and thirdly, any UF,
in the gas after the NaF sorbers would remain in the bottoms of the HF
still and be trapped in the electrolyte in the fluorine cell. ‘Since dis- |
carded electrolyte is routed through the fluoride salt waste systen,

described d above, any uranium in the salt would be recovered by fluorination,

Ph

Hydrogen Discard

There is practically no opportunity for UFg to leave the plant in
the hydrogen discard stream, In order to reach this point UF, would

‘have to pass through all the gas treating operations described &bove

plus additions] sorbers for trapping selenium and tellurium fission

) products and noble gases,

' DESIGN AND COST ESTIMATE

The first step in preparing the cost estimate was to define the
sequence of operations that constitute the flowsheet as shown in Fig, 3.
and in more detail on the drawings in Appendix D, These operations were

based upon laboratory and small-scale engineering data for batchwise

performance of the various unit processes, and it was assumed that the

steps could be successfully operated on a continuous flow basis, Para-
metric studies? were made to determine the breeding performance of the
MSBR for various ways of operating the processing plant, and from this
work basic conditions for the flowsheet were established, The computa-
tions did not necessarily determine the optimum economic processing cycle

since that presupposed knowledge of processing costs, A computer pro-

‘gram* was used to calculate material and energy balances for each process

-operation, giving the basic data for equipment design, -

A preliminary, highly simplified design was made for each major

equipment item in order to establish its size, geometry, heat transfer

“surface, and special features from which the amounts of materiels requir-

ed for the vessel could be calculated. Materials of construction were

selected using the general criteria that all vessels containing bismuth

would be constructed of molybdenum end that vessels containing only
molten fluoride salt would be made of Hastelloy N.. In other areas,
particularly for auxiliary equipment, nickel, stainless steel, and mild
steel were used, The time schedule for the cost estimate did not permit
us to make thorough studies of each vessel, and, for expediency, certain
shortcuts were adopted to preclude making lengthy stress and heat trans-

fer calculations, The principal time-saving assumptions were:
 

32

Small tanks, columns, and vessels to be. made of 3/8- in. plate;
larger ones of 1/2-in, plate

Heat exchanger tubing to be 1/2-in. oD x 16 gauge for all ves-
sels

Overall heat transfer coefficients to be in range 50-200  Bhu/br-
ft3-°F depending on fluids and whether natural or forced
convection ”

Annular space in jacketed vessels to be & nominal one-inch
thickness

Density, thermal conductivity, and specific heat values for proc-
ess fluids to be average values rather than temperature dependent

Freeboard volume standardized at 25% of required process volume
for tanks with fluctuating levels and 1 10% for tanks with constant

levels

Number of nozzles and thickness and number of supports and baf-
fles for heat exchanger bundles estimated from & cursory
examination of the vessel diameter and length

All heat exchanger bundles to be U-tube construction

The cost of each installed vessel was estimated using the unit costs
for materials given in Table 6, A single price of $200/pound was used a
for all molybdenum structursl shapes. The fabrication of molybdenum

 

into conventional shapes and vessels is extremely difficult and is .not
current technology; the $200/pound figure represents a "best guess’ of
the cost,

Unit costs of Hastelloy N were taken from the conceptual design
study of the 1000-Md(e) MSBR power plant and are, therefore, character-
istic of the fabrication of large vessels, In our case, components &re
generally small and intricately constructed, factors that are conducive
to higher unit costs. However, we believed that refining the costs was

‘unjustified in view of other uncertainties in the estimate,

Our study did not contain a sufficiently detailed design for di-
rectly estimating the cost of all items in the plant, For the cost of
‘some items, for example, piping, instrumentation, insulation, end elec-
trical comnections, we estimated charges by taking various percentages
of the installed equipment cost. In using this procedure the high cost
of molybdenuri equipment was teken into account by not using as large a

percentage on the molybdenum equipment costs as was used for nonmolybdenum

equipment. Mixiliary equipment items were estimated by determining
quantities and sizes (e.g., pumps, heaters, gas supply stations, sam-
plers, etc.) and using available cost data from other -areas of the MSR
‘program, Parallel lines of equipment for improved operating reliability
. were not included except that gas compressors were duplicated because
diaphram lifetimes are known to be very short, Also two spere high
level waste storage tanks were included, No allowances were made for
safety related features such as redundant cooling circuits, prevention
of liquid metal coolant-selt reactions, etc. No facilities ere provided
for cleaning up fuel salt should it become contaminated by NaBF, coolant
or vice versa, nor is there equipment for processing. routine (possibly

contaminated) liquid waste that originates in the reactor system.

The results of our study are summarized in Tables Ts 8, and 9;
these tables divide the equipment into three types--molybdenum, Hast-
elloy N, and auxiliary equipment respectively. The total installed cost
of molybdenum process vessels is $4,578, 750; about 65% of this cost is
for the three largest vessels, which are the lithium chloride extraction
column and the two large reservoirs for Bi-Li alloy in the rare earth
isolation system, Hastelloy N process equipment costs $3,091, 370. The
most costly items are the 223Pa decay tank ($710,490), which has a heat
duty of zbout 5.9 Mw, and the three waste tanks, which cost $L66, 600

each,

" The auxiliary equipment of Table 9 costs $2,486,290. These items
are essential for startup and/or smooth operation of the plant, In
several cases the costs were computed for entire systems which consisted
of & number of individual operations, The costs were estimated from -
‘data for similar systems and no flow diagrams or design calculations

were made,

CAPITAL COST OF THE PLANT

A summary of our cost study is given in Teble 10, We estimated di-
rect costs for the fabricated and installed equipment of $20,568 million.

$35,614 million, These costs do not include the cost of site, site prep-
aration, buildings, and facilities shared with the reactor plant such as
heat sinks, maintenance equipment, and emergency cooling, The cost of
these facilities were estimated by Robertson! and are included in the
design and cost study of the 1000-MW(e) MSER.

Items of direct cost that were not obtained from preliminary designs
were estimated as percentages of the installed equipment cost, The per-
centages were based upon previous experience in the design of rediochemical
plants, Piping, instrumentation, electrical connections, and insulation
costs were estimated in this way, Charges for radiation monitoring de-
vices, sampling stations, and a remotely operated fluorine plant were
estimated from other information, The discussion below describes our
method of finding these costs. |

Process Piping

Piping costs for a remotely operated processing plant are normally
in the range LO to 50% of the cost of installed process equipment, We
estimated the costs separately for molybdenum, Hastelloy N, and auxiliary"
piping, choosing factors of 30%, 50%, and LO% respectively. The low per-
centage value was used for molybdenum because of the relatively small
amount of this piping and the uncertainty in the base price ($200/1b)

chosen for molybdenum, The calculated costs are:

[ (cost of installed Mo process equipment) + (cost.
of Mo pumps) + cost of Mo heat exchangers)) (0.30)
[ $4,578,700 + 245,000 + 90, 000] (0. 30).

Process Instrumentation

Process instrumentation refers to devices for monitoring and con-
trolling the operation of the plant through measurements of flourates,
temperatures, pressures, concentrations, liquid levels, or other perti-
nent quantities, Generally the instrumentation cost is about 30% of the
installed equipment cost. Instrumentation cost for molybdenum equipment
was charged at 10% of the installed equipment cost, The lower percentage
allows for the inordinately high cost of fabricated molybdenum vessels,

'. Heater instrumentation was charged at only 15% of the installed heater
cost because such instrumentation is straightforward, We determined the
cost as follows: CC

Cell Electrical Connections

These connections are the power receptacles and leads inside the
processing area for supplying power to heaters, electric motors, and
instruments. ‘The cost was taken to be 5% of Hastelloy N and suxiliary

costs,

Thermal Insulation.

The thermal insulation cost for a chemical processing plant is usu-
ally about 5% of the equipment and piping costs. We calculated the cost
of insulation for Hastelloy N and auxiliary equipment in this way; how-
ever, we excluded the costs of the cell inert gas system, fluorine and
hydrogen supply system, and inert gas blanket system since this equipment
‘does not need insulation, Also we used only 50% of the piping cost
($388,820) for auxiliary equipment because it was estimated that only
about one-half of this piping would need insulation. For insulation on
molybdenum equipment we factored the equipment and piping costs at 3.5%,

Cost of thermal insulation.
= [(cost of Hastelloy N equipment) + (cost of Hastelloy N piping) +

(cost of auxiliary equipment) + (cost of auxiliary piping) -
(cost of inert gas blanket system) - (cost of cell inert gas
system) - (cost of F, and H, supply system)] (0,05) + (cost

$588,100

Rediation Monitoring

Radiation monitoring equipment refers to instruments for environ-
‘mental monitoring inside the processing cell, The cost of these

instruments was estimated to be $150,000,

Sampling Stations ’

A flowsheet review of plant operations indicated that salt and bis-
: muth samples will be needed at eighteen places and gas samples at fifteen
places to ensure proper control over the plant, Each sample station is

- a shielded, instrumentated facility designed for remotely securing and

 
 

16

transmitting samples without contaminating either the process or the
environment, Seversl sampling points would be in each station to mini-
mize shielding costs and containment problems, Our estimate of the cost

is based upon designs of similar installations for engineering experi-

ments and for MSRE installations, We estimated the cost of liquid:

samplers to be $50,000 each and gas samplers to be $25,000 ¢ each for &

total cost of $1, 275,000,

Fluorine Plant

‘The cost of manufacturing fluorine and hydrogen on site by elec-

~ trolyzing recycled hydrogen fluoride was compared with the cost of

purchasing these gases and disposing of unused excess as waste, - Our
supplementary cost study (Appendix A) showed that once-through operation
contributed about 0,11 mills/kWhr to the fuel cycle charge for the cost
of waste containers, shipping, salt mine disposal, fluorine, other chem-
icals, and capital equipment, “On the other hand, the corresponding fuel:

. cycle charge for recycle operation including the fluorine plant was

gbout 0,02 mills/kWhr,

We have estimated the capital cost of a remotely. operated fluorine
plant to be $1. 005 million; the cost includes labor, materials, piping,
and instrumentation, ® The plant is designed to produce 148 1bs F;/day,
which allows about fifty percent utilization in the fluorinators, Hy-

drogen output of the plant ‘is used in UF; reduction and salt sparging.

Indirect Costs

Indirect costs include construction overhead, engineering and in-
spection charges, taxes and insurance, contingency, &nd interest during

construction, These costs were obtained as described below,

Construction Overhead

On the basis of past experience for the cost of chemical processing
plants this cost was ‘taken as 20% of the total direct cost and equal to
Bh. 14 million,
C

L7

Engineering and Inspection Charge

 

This charge was computed by the guidelines of NUS-531° which was
written specifically for reactor plants but was used in this study,
Plant engineering charges sre based upon the total direct costs of the
installation, which is $152.3 million® for the reactor plant plus
$20,568 million for the processing plant, The specified charge is 5.3%
of the direct cost of the processing plant;

In addition, the cost guide specifies that a premium be added to
the above amount to account for the "novel" feature of the design, This
charge is &lso a function of the direct cost and for this plant is
$2,700,000, Although the use of a "novel! design surcharge rather than
the lower "proven" design charge of $1,600,000 appears to violate the
condition that the cost estimate was to be for a plant based on developed
MSBR technology, it is our opinion that the complexity of the plant is
such that the higher premium will be required.

The total engineering charge
($20,568,000) (0,053) + 2,700,000

Taxes and Insurance

This account covers property and all-risk insurance, state and local
property taxes on the site and improvements during the construction pe-
riod, and sales taxes on purchased materials, Using NUS-531 &s & guide
and taking the total direct cost of the installation as & basis, the
charge rate was found to be L.2%. For taxes and insurance the cost is
($20,568,000) (0,042) = $863,800, . oC

Contingency

The contingency charge was taken as 20% of the total direct cost
minus the cost of molybdenum - components. We felt that the $200/pound
charge’ for fabricated molybdenum equipment already contained a sufficient

contingency factor,

Interest During Construction

It was assumed that the processing plant would be built concurrently
with the reactor plant over. a three-year construction period. ' The in-
terest rate on borrowed money was teken at 8%/year, and the total amount

FUEL CYCLE COST

~ Inventory and use charges were velued at the unit costs given in
Table 11 3 inventory, net worth, operating charges, and fuel cycle costs
are given in Table 12, The gross fuel cycle cost is 1.21 mi11s/Kihr;
about 58% of this cost is contributed by fixed charges on the processing
plant and another 32% by the reactor inventory. The fuel yield of
3.27%/yr gives a production credit of about 0.09 mills/kWhr which is
slightly more than the operating charges of about 0,08 mills/kihr, . The
net. fuel cycle cost is gbout 1,12 mills/kwhr,

CAPITAL COST VERSUS PLANT SIZE

The usefulness of & cost estimate is greatly enhanced if the capital
cost can be related to plant throughput so that the most economic opera-
tion of the reactor system cen be determined, - In this case we have a
power station of predetermined size [1000-MW(e)] so that, strictly speek-
ing, cost-versus-throughput data will apply only to & single 1000-Mi(e) :
MSER. With these data, parametric studies of the reactor plent-processing

plant complex can be made to find the optimum throughput and the lowest

fuel cycle cost, Another way of decreasing fuel cycle cost is to asso-

ciate a larger power plant, for example, two or more 1000-MiW(e) MSBR's,
with a single processing facility; however, such & consideration was

beyond the scope of’ this study.

We chose to estimate the capital cost of the fluorination--reductive

extraction--metal transfer processing plant for a throughput that is three

- times the rate used above, corresponding to & 3. 33-day processing cycle

for the 1000-MA(e) MSBR. .The shorter cycle time was selected because it
was believed that, at cycle times longer than 10 days, the breeding gain
would be adversely affected by higher parasitic neutron losses to *>®Pa,

Our estimated capital cost is given in Table 13, Direct costs are $28.5

million, and indirect costs are $20. Ol million for a total investment of

as 54 million,

Capital costs for the plant for a 10-day (0. 874 gal/min) processing
cycle and the plant for a 3,33-day (2.62 gel/min) processing cycle are
plotted in Fig, 6, and a straight line is drawn between the points, The
curve is extrapolated to cover processing rates from 3 gal/min to 0.24
gal/min (cycle times = 3 to 37 days). Below & rate of 0.24 gal/min, the
curve is drawn horizontally at a capital cost of $25 million, It was

felt that $25 million probably represents a lower limit for the cost of
a plant of the present design.

The cost-versus-throughput line has a slope of 0.28 which indicates

“that the capital cost is not strongly affected by throughput. However,
"the economic: advantage in ‘fuel cycle cost of processing a 1000-Mw(e)
MSER on longer or shorter. cycle ‘times than 10 days has not been calculated,

It is apparent .though that lower fuel cycle: costs can be obtained by proc-
essing several 1000-Mi(e) MSBR's in one processing plant. Although this

is undoubtedly true, ‘the curve of Fig, 6 is not an accurate representa-

tion of the cost of processing ‘several reactors because the additional
radioactivity that would be handled by the plant would increase the cost
above that shown. TL Co

Cost Estimate for & 3, 33-Day Fuel Cycle Time

A complete redesign of the processing plant wes not attempted to
~ obtain the capital cost at the greater throughput, However, the cost of
each item of equipment listed in Tables Ts 8, and 9 was > recomputed by the
following. general procedures:

Redesign and estimate the cost of a few vessels that are typical
of the several types of equipment, e.g., tanks with internal heat
exchange surface, columns with frozen salt on walls, liquid/liquid
contactors with internal heat exchange surface, etc, Compare the
cost of the redesigned vessel with its counterpart in the 10-day
cycle case and determine 2 scale factor from the relationship

Cp.
2.
where n = scale factor

C,= fabricated vessel cost for 3. 33- -day cycle.

C,= fabricated vessel cost for 10-day cycle

R= flow rate through processing plant for 3.33-day cycle
R,= flow rate through processing plant for 10-dey cycle

Determine the febricated cost of the remaining vessels by using

the appropriate scale factor, the previously calculated cost for

the 10-day cycle case, and the &bove equation,

Scale factors for individual pieces of equipment were in the range
0.52 to 0.82, however, & number of items had & scale factor equal to
zero because their sizes were independent of processing rate, Typicel
examples of vessels having zero scale factor are the *>®Pa decay tank,
the divalent rare earth accumulator, and the trivalent rare earth accu-
malator, Thus the overall scale factor (0.28) for the plant is considerably
below the value of about 0.6 customarily associated with chemical plants.

Installed costs for molybdenun, Hastelloy N, and auxiliary equip-
‘ment are given in Tables 1k, 15, and 16. An overall scale factor was
determined for each group of equipment by comparing the total costs from
the sbove tables with the corresponding total from Tables 7, 8, and 9.
It was found that the molybdenum equipment scaled by a factor of O. 3,
Hastelloy N equipment by a factor of O, 26, and the auxiliery equipment
‘by a factor of 0,33, These factors were used to determine some of the

direct costs given below,

NEEDED DEVELOPMENT, UNCERTAINTIES AND ALTERNATIVES

There are sufficient laboratory and engineering date to show that
chemical principles for the fluorination--reductive extraction--metal
transfer process gre fundamentzlly sound, Except for fluorination, most
of the development has been in relatively small-scale experiments, ‘and
design studies which, in addition to giving encouraging results, have
identified problem areas, The more important problem are&s and uncer-

tainties are discussed below.

Materiels of (Construction

‘The most basic problem to this process is that of a material for
containing molten bismuth or bismuth-salt mixtures, Molybdenum has
excellent corrosion resistance to both phases but is a very difficult |
‘metal to fabricate. For example, in making welded joints the heat-
‘affected zone becomes very brittle due to recrystalization, and ductility
can be restored only by cold working which is normally not practical on
fabricated equipment, Considerable progress has been made in the making
of molybdenum shapes and joints, and, in time, we feel that fabrication
technology will be perfected, The task will be difficult even for small
molybdenum equipment, and, for large items that are required in parts of
this plant, the job is formideble, ‘However, molybdenum equipment will
slmost surely be expensive,

“Graphite is being considered as a possible elternate material of
construction, Also it may be possible to apply molybdenum coatings to &
more easily fabricated material such &s a nickel-bease elloy. Tungsten
coatings would also-be satisfactory.

Continuous Fluorination

Fluorination of molten salts for uranium recovery has been success-
fully demonstrated on several occasions’ s°? »9,10 in batchwise, pilot
plant operations, and the development of a continuous method ‘is in prog-
‘ress, Successful continuous fluorination depends upon maintaining a
protective frozen salt layer on wetted surfaces of the fluorinator to
 

 

 

 

&

61

prevent catastrophic corrosion, Establishing and maintaining this pro-
tective coating is a developmental problem that must be solved, The
solution is complicated by the difficulty of simulating an internal heat

source in the nonradioactive salt of an engineering test, Experimental

~ results have been encouraging, and the frozen-wall fluorinator should be

practical to build and operate,

Bismuth Removel From Salt

Nickel-base alloys are rapidly corroded by molten bismuth, and ves-
sels that normally contain only salt, including the reactor vessel and
primary heat exchangers, must be protected from chronic or recurring

exposure to the metal entrained in salt, A cleanup device for the salt

- stream, consisting of a vessel packed with nickel wool, exists only in

concept, and its effectiveness cannot be evaluated until tolerance
limits for bismuth in salt have been determined as well as suitable
analytical methods for detecting low concentrations (<! ppm Bi) in salt,

The magnitude of bismuth entrainment cannot be completely assessed until

~ bismuth-salt contactors have been developed and tested, and cleanup

measures could be mandatory for the salt stream from each contractor if
bismuth entrainment is unacceptable, The alloweble bismuth concentration
in salt will almost surely be quite low, and it is believed that bismuth-
salt separation after each contact will be sharp. If not, a dependsble
and practicable bismuth removal method must be developed,

Instrumentation for Process Control

The continuous interchange of salt between the reactor and processing
plant requires quick and reliable analytical techniques for salt composi-

‘tion, uranium and protactinium content, and w/t ratio, If on-line
methods are not developed, laboratory analyses could be used, but these

are slow, involve the hazard and expense of sample. handling, and require
holdup tanks with additional inventory at the sample points, Similarly,
on-line monitoring of reductive extraction and metal transfer operations
by readings on the salt and/or bismuth phases would allow firm process
control; however, we believe that these operations can be properly con-

ducted without sophisticated instrumentation,

 

 
 

 

62

Accidental loss of fissile material from the fluorination--reductive
extraction--metal transfer process is extremely unlikely, Maloperations
in 211 units except UFg reduction will either return uranium and protac-
tinium to the reactor in the recycle salt or divert each into an area
where fission products are accumulated for disposal. Malfunction in the
UFg reduction operation could route UF toward the H,-HF recycle system,
and adequate monitoring and traps must be provided to prevent such an
occurrence, The process already includes means of recovering fissile
values from waste salt since all waste is held for decay and fluorinated
before ultimate disposal, - oo

Some, but not all, process instrumentation is required to function
in a 600° to 6LO°C environment, This condition will undoubtedly neces-
~ sitate a development. program for instrument. components, for example,

- sensors and transducers.

Noble and Seminoble Metal Behavior

Noble and seminoble metals constitute about 20.3 wt. and 1,6 wt. %
respectively of all fission products and account for 25,2% and 2,06% of
‘the fission product decay energy at equilibrium, The behavior of these
‘fission products in the MSBR is not fully understood; however, data from
MSRE operation indicate that they are probably removed by attaching
themselves to reactor surfaces and/or leaving with the inert sparge gas,
Our treatment of the flowsheet is based on this premise, and we have

designed the processing plant to handle only a small amount of noble and

" seminoble metals, Most noble and seminoble metals have volatile fluorides
. and would be removed in fluorination, If the behavior is not as assumed

and large amounts of noble and seminoble metals enter the processing

plant, extensive redesign of the gas recycle and salt cleanup systems
would be required. - Heat removal problems would be more severe and

| additional treatment would be required to remove reduced noble metal

~ particulates from the reconstituted fuel salt. A better understanding
- of the behavior of this class of fission products in the. reactor sy stem

is very important.

‘Operational and Safety Considerations

When operational and safety considerations for the processing plant
are examined in detail, it will probably be found that their influence
on equipment design will be &ppreciable, There is a volume heat source
due to decaying radioactive nuclides in practically every vessel in the
plant, requiring continuous cooling and fail-safe systems, In some ves-
sels, high heat removal rates are required because concentrations of the
radionuclides are relatively high, A critical design analysis is neces-
sary for every potentially dangerous area to ascertain the consequences
of abnormal operation, especially in regard to interruptions in coolant

flow,

ACKNOWLEDGMENT

Appendix A: Economic Comparison of Process Gas oo Co \o/
Systems for the MSBR Processing Flant
Gases used in processing MSER fuel selt are fluorine for removing
uranium from the salt, hydrogen fluoride for oxidizing metals dissolved
in bismuth to fluorides for extraction into salt, end hydrogen for re-
ducing UF, to UF, and for sparging fuel salt after fluorination, In
addition a considerable amount of UFg is handled in fluorination end
reduction, The principal reactions of the process gases gre:
Fluorination
UF, + Fp = UFg
‘Reduction -
UF, +H, = oUF, + 2HF
F, + B ~ 2HF

| Hydrofluorination
Pa (Bi) + YHF -+ PaF, (salt) + 2H,

FP (Bi) + xHF + (FP)F_ (salt) + (x/2) H,

arging

Fp + Hy ~ 2HF Co -
The net effect of the first, second, and fourth operations is to consume oo
H, and F, while making HF, whereas, the third operation consumes HF and
produces Ha. Since the amount of HF consumed in hydrofluorination is
“much smaller than the amount produced in the other operations, the proc-
essing plant must dispose of the excess hydrogen fluoride either as .
waste or by conversion to hydrogen and fluorine for recycle, The first
alternative requires the purchase of the three gases plus the cost of
converting large quantities of contaminated hydrogen fluoride to & solid
waste for salt mine storage; the second zlternative requires the instal-
lation of a remote fluorine plant with a considerably smaller makeup and
waste disposal cost, | Co

The two choices for treating the process gases were studied to So .
determine the more economic: method, The simplified flow diagrams in
“Figs, A-1 and A-2 show the processing steps end the mass flow rates of
resctant and product gises. In each diagrem fluorine utilization in NU
fluorinators is taken as 50%; hydrogen fluoride utilization in hydro-.
fluorinators and hydrogen utilization in the reduction column are taken

as 10%.

‘shown by the curves of Fig, A-3. The KOH concentration is reduced from

69

Fission product contamination in the gas stream is primarily from |
iodine and to a less extent from bromine, Small amounts of noble gases
and volatile noble metals gre present, but, as explained earlier, the
short removal time for these nuclides in the reactor greatly limits the

quantity, Heat generation in the neutralized waste is due almost entirely

"to iodine and daughter products.

Since this cost study was for comparison purposes, only major ele-
ments of the cost were considered, For example, piping instrumentation,
insulation, auxiliary equipment, etc. were not included in the estimate.
The study was limited to comparing the costs of major pieces of equip-
ment, consumed chemicals, end waste disposal,

Once-Through Process Cycle

In the once-through treatment (Fig. A-1), gases from the reduction
columm, hydrofluorinators, and purge columns flow into a caustic neu-
tralizer containing aqueous KOH where hydrogen fluoride and halogen
fission products are removed, Hydrogen leaves the neutralizer, passes

through alumina and charcoal beds for removal of small amounts of vola-

tile noble metals and noble gases, and exhausts to the atmosphere, Five

neutralizers, each holding about 135 £t® of 10 M KOH solution, are needed,
One tank is on-stream for a 100-hr cycle while the neutralized contents
of the remaining tanks sre in various stages of fission product decay.

The batchwise cycle is necessary to allow decay before the solution is
evaporated to dryness, At the end of the 100-hr reaction period the
fission product decay energy is 153 kW; this decays rather quickly as

10M to 0,5 M in the 100-hr period,
I
After L0O-hours decay the ‘&queous. solution is evaporated to a solid

waste residue in 24-in, D x 10-ft- long/waste containers. Condensate is
reused to make fresh KOH solution, If the waste container is held about

‘32 days, its heat emission is sufficiently low to qualify the can for

salt mine storage &t the minimum cost of $300 per cen,

The 2L-in, D x 10-ft-long/can is the largest permissible can for
storage in a salt mine, and the usable length, excluding nozzles, lifting

bails, etc., is approximately 8 ft. About 8,64 ft° solid waste is pro-

duced each day, hence, for operation at 80% plant factor, 105 cans must

be sent to permanent storage each year,

Gas Recycle System

In the recycle system (Fig, A-2), gases from the reduction column,
purge columns, and hydrofluorinators are compressed to about 2 atm
pressure and chilled to -40°C ‘to condense hydrogen fluoride from the
H,-HF mixture, Some of the fission products, primarily volatile com-
pounds of I, Br, Se, and Te, are expected to condense to a large extent
with the hydrogen fluorine, These compounds are more volatile than
hydrogen fluorine and can be separated by distilling the mixture at low
temperature at gbout 2. atm pressure. Vapor pressure data are shown in
Fig. A-L. The overhead condenser is kept at -LO°C so that hydrogen
fluoride loss with the noncondenssble gases .is minimel, Part of the
liquid hydrogen fluoride flows from the still to an electrolytic cell
to regenerate H, and Fy; the remainder is recycled to the hydrofluorinators.

The H,-rich gas from the distillation column is bubbled through a
caustic scrubber similar to the one used in the once-through system to
remove halides, The gas is dried in regenerative silica gel sorbers and
recycled to the reduction and purge columns, About 5% of the hydrogen

is removed from the system on each cycle to purge selenium and tellurium

by sorption on activated alumina and noble gases by sorption on charcoal,

The neutralization system consists of a scrubber column and three,
20-13 reservoirs for 10 M KOH, Each reservoir is on-stream for 34 days
until the concentration is reduced to 0.5 M KOH; the heat generation
rate attains equilibrium at about 210 kW (see Fig. 355 page 29). The

spent solution is set aside for fission product decay for us days before

: being evaporated to dryness in 2L-in. D x 10-ft-long waste containers.

The volume of solid waste produced is 4.83 £t° every 3L days, requiring
only 2.07 waste containers per year for reactor operation at 80% plant

factor.

The waste container needs to be held only about nine days after the
final batch is evaporated in order to qualify for the minimum interment
cost of $300, This cost is for a maximum heat evolution of 30 w/ft of

container,

Fuel Cycle Cost Comparison

Costs for the two gas treatment methods were compared by examining
only the items for which there would be a significant cost differentiel,
Preliminary designs were ‘made of me. jor equipment items, and installed
costs were estimated, The costs of chemicals were calculated from the

requirements shown on the flowsheets, Figs. A-1 and A-2,

In the case of the once-through gas cycle, the costs of purchased

- gases were calculated in two ways, One calculation was made for the

purchase of all required fluorine, hydrogen, and hydrogen fluoride from
outside sources, In the second case, hydrogen fluoride and some hydrogen
were purchased, and fluorine and hydrogen were manufactured on-site from

HF in a nonradioactive fluorine plant. For complete gas recycle opera-

.tion, only the equilibrium hydrogen fluoride lost in the noncondensable

gas from distillation and that consumed in hydrofluorination are pur-
chased, ‘The required hydrogen makeup is equivalent to that discarded
less the’ hydrogen produced in hydrofluorination,

The costs of the two methods for treating the gases are compared in
Table A-1, The once-through gas cycle costs gbout 0,115 mills/kithr end

is almost five times more expensive than the recycle system, due primarily:

to the higher charges for waste disposal and purchased fluorine. The

most significant charge in the recycle system is the amortization of the

remote fluorine plant, A smell reduction in cost can be made in the

once-through gas cycle when fluorine and hydrogen ere manufactured on-

site from hydrogen ‘fluoride, however, the fuel cycle cost is still four

| times that of ‘the recycle system.

. On the basis of this comparison, the gas recycle sy stem was selected

for the MSBR fuel reprocessing flowsheet,

Appendix C: Steady State Concentrations
in the Metal Transfer System

The metal-transfer system consists of captive bismuth and lithium
chloride phases that circulate in closed loops, receiving fission pro-
ducts on one side of the loop and transferring them to a second phase at
the other side, Throughout the sy stem the donor and acceptor fluids
operate with steady state concentrations of: all metals being transferred,
the equilibria depending upon the distribution characteristics of each
. species and the purge rate from the acceptor fluid, This system has
been carefully analyzed by Bell,” and his datz are given in Fig, c-1.

The purge of fission products from the Bi-5 at, ¢ Li reservoir is
‘shown as & continuous 5. 669 gel/day stream, Making the rate continuous
. was a convenience for calculations; in actual practice the withdrawal
of such a small amount would be batchwise on perhaps & two-day cycle.
Similarly, the indicated withdrewal from the Bi-50 at. 2 Li reservoir
would probably be on a 30- -day cycle, . .

Appendix D: Flowsheet of the Fluorination--Reductive
‘Extraction--Metal Transfer Process [1000-MW(e) MSER]

The attached flowsheets [Dwgs. No, F12173-CD-173E and No. F-12173-
CD-17LE] give pertinent material and energy balance data for processing
the reference MSBR on a 10-day cycle, During the course of the design
and cost study, significant. design improvements.in the original concept
of the plant became apparent. As these changes were made to the flow-
sheet, it was not always possible to fully investigate effects upon
other areas of the plant because of the urgency to complete the cost
study on schedule, Thus, the reader might not always obtain a satis-

factory material balance in specific areas of the flowsheet; however,

the authors believe that such inconsistencies are minor and do not

affect the results or conclusions of this study.

Although the drawings do not show engineering features with respect
to instrumentation, coolant flow, auxiliary piping, service lines, etc,,
these items were included in the cost estimate, Equipment. and vessels
for startup, shutdown, and standby operation of the plant were also
included in the cost, however, they are not shown,
