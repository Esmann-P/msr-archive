ABSTRACT

Liquid~phase-controlled mobile-interface mass-transfer coefficients
were measured for transfer of dissolved oxygen into small helium bubbles
in cocurrent turbulent pipeline flow for five different mixtures of
glycerine and water. These coefficients were determined by transient
response experiments in which the dissolved oxygen was measured at only
one position in a closed recirculating loop and recorded as a function
of time. Using an independent photographic determination of the inter-
facial areas, the mass-transfer coefficients were extracted from these
measured transients and determined as functions of pipe Reynolds number,
Schmidt number, bubble Sauter-mean diameter, and gravitational orienta-
tion of the flow,

Two general types of behavior were observed:

(1) Above pipe Reynolds numbers for which turbulent inertia forces
dominate over gravitational forces, horizontal and vertical flow mass-
transfer coefficients were identical and varied according to the regression

equation

Sh/sc 2 = 0,34 Re®*94 (a, /D)*° ;

The observed Reynolds number exponent agreed generally with other liter-
ature data for cocurrent pipeline flow but did not agree with expectation
based on equivalent power dissipation comparisons with agitated vessel
data,

(2) Below the Reynolds numbers that marked the equivalence of hor-
izontal and vertical flow coefficients, the horizontal-flow coefficients

continued to vary according to the above equation until, at low flows,

iii
iv
severe stratification of the bubbles made operation impractical. The
vertical-flow coefficients at these lower Reynolds numbers underwent a
transition to approach constant asymptotes characteristic of the bubbles
rising through the quiescent liquid. For small bubbles in the most
viscous mixture tested, both horizontal and vertical-flow coefficients
underwent this transition,

An expression was developed for the relative importance of turbulent
inertial forces compared to gravitational forces, P/E. This ratio
served as a good criterion for establishing the pipe Reynolds numbers
above which horizontal and vertical-flow mass-transfer coefficients were
identical. In addition, it proved to be a useful linear scaling factor
for calculating the vertical-flow coefficients in the above mentioned
transition region.

A seemingly anomalous behavior was observed in data for water
(plus about 200 ppm N-butyl alcohol) which exhibited a significantly
smaller Reynolds number exponent than did data for the other fluid mix-
tures. To explain this behavior, a two-regime "turbulence interaction"
model was formulated by balancing turbulent inertial forces with drag
forces. The relationship of the drag forces to the bubble relative-flow
Reynolds number gave rise to the two regimes with the division being at
Re, = 2, The resulting bubble mean velocities for each regime were then
substituted into Frossling-type equations to determine the mass-transfer
behavior. The resulting Reynolds number exponent for one of the regimes
(Re, £ 2) agreed well with the observed data but the predicted exponent

for the effect of the ratio of bubble mean diameter to conduit diameter,

a_./Ds was less than that observed. The mass~transfer equations

particles in agitated vessels and also compared favorably with the

resulting from the other regime (Re, > 2) agreed well with data for
water data mentioned above,

For comparison, a second analytical model was developed based on
surface renewal concepts and an eddy diffusivity that varied with
Reynolds number, Schmidt number, bubble diameter, interfacial condi-
tion, and position away from an interface, Using a digital computer,

a tentative numerical solution was obtained which treated a dimension~
less renewal period, T,, as a parameter. This renewal period was
interpreted as being a measure of the rigidity of the interface, T, = O
corresponding to fully mobile and T, -+ approximately 2.7 (in this case)

to fully rigid interfaces,

INTRODUCTION

When gas bubbles are dispersed in a continuous liquid phase,
dissolved constituents of sufficient volatility will be exchanged between
the liquid and the bubbles, effectively redistributing any concentration
imbalances that exist. Common practices involve contacting gas bubbles
with an agitated liquid in such a manner that a relatively large inter-
facial area is available, Techniques such as passing gas bubbles up
through a liquid column or mechanically stirring a gas-liquid mixture in
a tank have been studied extensively and the design technology for these
is relatively firm. However, one method, cocurrent turbulent flow in a
pipeline, has not been given a great deal of attention. A review of the
literature has shown that the available data are insufficient to allow
confident determination of the mass-transfer rates in such a system.
This research, then, was undertaken to provide additional information
that will aid in determining liquid phase controlled mass-transfer rates
for cocurrent turbulent flow of small bubbles and liquids in a pipeline.

The impetus for this work was provided by the Molten Salt Breeder
Reactor (MSBR) Program of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory where recent
remarkably successful operation of a molten salt fueled nuclear reactor!
has convincingly demonstrated the feasibility of this power system. The
economic competitiveness of an MSBR, however, depends to a significant
extent on the breeding ratio obtainable, The production within the

liquid fuel of fissicn-product poisons, principally xenon-135, exerts
2
a strong influence on the neutron economy of the reactor and consequently
on the breeding ratio itself,

One method proposed for removing the xenon would require injecting
small helium bubbles into the turbulently flowing regions of the fuel-
coolant stream and allowing them to circulate with the fuel. Since such
bubbles would be deficient in xenon compared to the nearby bulk stream,
the dissolved xenon would be transferred by turbulent diffusion across
the concentration potential gradient. By continuous injection and
removal of the helium bubbles the equilibrium xenon poisoning can be
significantly reduced. Since a large amount of gas in the fuel could
influence the reactivity of the core, this system would be limited to
low volume fractions.

Peebles? showed that removal of dissolved oxygen from a given mixture
of glycerine and water by small helium bubbles could closely match the
hydrodynamic and mass-transfer conditions in an MSBR and suggested using
such a system in a similitude experiment from which the actual MSBR
behavior might be inferred, Other desirable features of such a system
include: (1) convenient variation of the Schmidt number by using differ-
ent percentages of glycerine in water, (2) operation at room temperature
using glass hardware that allows photographic measurements through an
optically clear system, and (3) easy measurement of the dissolved oxygen
content by commercially available instruments. Therefore an oxygen-
glycerine-water system was chosen for this study.

The objective of the program was to measure liquid phase controlled
axially averaged mass-transfer coefficients, k, defined by

r L

k ax
x

k = T .

 
3

The local mass-transfer coefficients, LS are defined by

J=k a Cove - Cg] s
where J is the mass transferred from the liquid to the bubbles per unit
time per unit volume of liquid, a is the interfacial area per unit volume
of liquid, Cova is the bulk average concentration, and Cy is the inter-
facial concentration,

These coefficients need to be established as a function of Schmidt
number, Reynolds number, bubble size, conduit diameter, gravitational
orientation of the flow (vertical or horizontal), interfacial condition
(absence or presence of a surface active agent), and the volume fraction
of the bubbles. The scope of this thesis is limited to the ranges of
variables listed in Table I, below, which for the most part represent
limits of the experimental apparatus. Extensions of this program, how-
ever, are projected to include different conduit diameters and different

interfacial conditions,

Table I. Ranges of Independent Variables Covered

 

 

Variable Range

The mass~transfer coefficients were extracted from measurements of
the coefficient-area products, ka, and independent photographic measure-

ments of the interfacial areas per unit volume, a. The products, ka,
L

were established by means of a unique transient response technique in
which the changes in liquid phase concentration were measured as a func-
tion of time at only one position in a closed liquid recirculating system
while helium bubbles were injected at the test section entrance and
removed richer in oxygen at the exit. The apparatus for generating
these small bubbles (with an independent control of their mean size) and
effectively separating a high percentage from the flowing mixture had to
be developed prior to the start of this research, These are described in
Chapter III along with the photographic equipment and technique for estab-
lishing the interfacial areas.

The results of this study are expected to be of immediate benefit
to the MSBR Program and should also prove useful to workers in the
general chemical industry. Application may extend to such diverse areas
as general extraction of radioactive elements from reactor effluents,
bubble lifetimes in the coolant of liquid metal fast breeder reactors,
and oxygen treatment of sewage effluents. In addition, benefits of a
fundamental nature may be derived in that the research concerns transfer
of a scalar in a turbulent shear flow field in which the fluid velocity
field effectively seen by the bubbles is primarily due to the turbulent
fluctuations. The characteristics of mass transfer between dispersed
bubbles and a continuous liquid phase in turbulent flow are thus seen

to be of immediate scientific and practical importance,
CHAPTER II
LITERATURE REVIEW

A comprehensive survey was made of literature related to mass
transfer between small bubbles and liquids in cocurrent turbulent flow.
An exhaustive review of all this literature would be lengthy and some-
what pointless. Consequently, only those works that are considered
representative of the field (not necessarily of most significance) are
included in this chapter and the author intends no derogation or slight-
ing by the omission of any work. No significance should be attached to
the order in which references appear. For a fairly complete documenta-
tion of work related to this subject, the reader is referred to several

excellent review articles,®”®

Experimental-Cocurrent Flow

There have been very few direct measurements of mass-transfer
coefficients for cocurrent turbulent flow of small gas bubbles and
liquids, perhaps because substantial special apparatus seems to be
required for these measurements. Recently Jepsen® measured the liquid
phase controlled product of mass-transfer coefficient, k, and inter-
facial surface area per unit volume, a, for air/water flow in horizontal
pipes with and without spiral turbulence promoters. For straight tubes
without turbulence promoters he correlated his data by the equation,

Ags shown in Chapter IV, Page 58, the energy dissipation per unit

volume, €,s can be represented as
_t= Lo) = HE pelle (1)

Therefore, Jepsen's correlation reveals that
Sh ~ Re'*1l/@ 2a

Care must be taken in interpreting the influence of Reynolds number
on k when the product, ka, is reported because the interfacial area it-
self may depend on the Reynolds number. No attempt was made by Jepsen
to separate the area from the product.

Scott and Hayduk,'© in admittedly exploratory experiments, dissolved
carbon dioxide and helium into water, ethanol, and ethylene glycol in
horizontal flow pipelines. Thus they did vary the diffusivity but, like
Jepsen, did not separate the ka product.

Their results were correlated by the equation

from which may be inferred

Lamont! and Lamont and Scott? dissolved, in single file fashion,
relatively large CO, bubbles into water under vertical and horizontal
flow conditions. They did not vary bubble diameter or Schmidt number.
At sufficiently large Reynolds numbers their horizontal and vertical
results became identical, The data above these Reynolds numbers were
correlated as

Heuss, King, and Wilke'® studied absorption into water of ammonia

and oxygen in horizontal froth flow. The liquid phase coefficients were

controlling only in the oxygen runs and consequently they did not vary
the Schmidt number and their results were also obtained as the product
of ka. However, using estimates of surface area in froth flow, their
data reveal

Experimental-Agitated Vessels

Often the data for transfer to bubbles or particles in agitated
vessels are correlated in terms of the power dissipated. Using Equation
(1) we might relate these results to what would be expected for flow in
conduits.

Calderbank and Moo-Young' © correlated data for different particles
and small bubbles dispersed in different liquids in agitated vessels.

Their equation, determined partly through dimensional analysis, is

They also indicate that in the range of mean bubble diameters, 0.025
< d = 0.1 inches, the mass-transfer coefficients increase linearly,
undergoing a transition from "small" bubble behavior where Sh ~ Sc¥ 2 to
"large" bubble behavior where Sh ~ Sc 2, They conclude that this tran-
sition corresponds to a change in interfacial condition from rigid to
mobile,

Sherwood and Brian!” used dimensional analysis to correlate data for
particles in different agitated liquids. Their correlation graphically
related Sh, /sct/ 2 to (e a/v?) 2. Using Equation (1) (with e,/p = c,)
and drawing a line tangent to the high power dissipation end of their
correlating curve gives

Barker and Treybal'® correlated mass-transfer coefficients for boric

acid and benzoic acid particles dissolving in water and 45% sucrose solu-

tions with a stirrer Reynolds number, Re,, proportional to the speed of

rotation. They reported

If the power dissipation is assumed proportional to the cube of the
rotation speed, then
k ~ Re®*76 gel/ 2 S .
The effect of Schmidt number is not as would be inferred from the above

because § was reported to be essentially proportional to Sct 2 in their

experiments.

The preceding are representative of data available that may have
direct applicability to cocurrent flow in conduits. Some other works
that may be of indirect interest include cocurrent turbulent flow of

19-22 mags transfer

dispersed liquid drops in a continuous liquid phase,
from a turbulent liquid to a free interface,®372® and innumerable studies
of the motions of, and mass transfer from, individual bubbles or parti-
cles under steady relative flow conditions (e.g., References 26-30).

For systems in which bubbles move steadily through a fluid, some
relevant findings include the fact that, depending on bubble size and
liquid properties, the bubble motion in a gravity field may vary from
creeping flow to flow characterized by a turbulent boundary layer.
Irrespective of this, the mass-transfer correlations usually take two
basic "Frssling" forms (neglecting the constant term) depending on
whether there is a rigid interface (no slip condition) or a completely
mobile interface with internal circulation of the fluid within the
bubble (or drop). In substantial agreement with theoretical treatments,
the former data are correlated with

shy ~ Re, 2 gel/ 3
and the latter
sh, ~ Re, 2 gol/ 2 = Pe, */ 2
Good accounts of these relative flow equations and their derivations are

given by Lochiel and Calderbank®' and by Sideman. #*
Discussion of Available Experimental Data

It is seen that there have been very few direct measurements of

mass transfer to small cocirculating bubbles in a turbulent field and
10
none that are complete in terms of all the independent variables. The
product, ka, is often not separated, because of the difficulty in estab-
lishing the interfacial area. This makes some of the available data
difficult to interpret and of limited value for application at different
conditions.

Not enough experimental information is available to assess the
influence of Schmidt number on Sherwood number although the Schmidt
number exponent most often appears to vary between 1/3 and 1/2 —
apparently determined by the interfacial condition (the Schmidt number
exponent may even be greater than 1/2, e.g. , Reference 10).

The effects of bubble mean diameter and pipe size have received
less attention than the Schmidt number and, as yet, no systematic effect
can be confidently cited, Calderbank and Moo-Young, however, observed a
linear dependence over a limited range of bubble diameters in agitated
vessels.

The influence of Reynolds number has been the most studied. From
References 9-15, it would appear that Sherwood number for gas-liquid
flow in conduits may vary with pipe Reynolds number to a power between
0.9 and 1.1 (although Lamont! found it to be 0.52). In contrast, the
effect of Reynolds number (turbulence level) in stirred vessels (Refer-
ences 16-18) would appear to yield a power between 0.6 and 0.8, This
apparent difference between agitated vessels and flow in conduits is
surprising because one would think that flowing through a closed con-
duit is Just another way to stir the liquid. There should be little

fundamental difference in the effect of the turbulence produced.
11

Theoretical

It is convenient to identify four different analytical approaches
designed to provide a description of mass transfer to bubbles from a
turbulent liquid that may be applicable to cocurrent flow, The author
has chosen to name these (1) Surface Renewal, (2) Turbulence Interac-
tions, (3) Modeling of the Eddy Structure, and (4) Dimensional Analysis
(Empiricism). These do not necessarily encompass all approaches and
there may be considerable overlapping among areas (for example, a cer-
tain degree of empiricism is evident in each). There may be only an
indirect equivalence among those within a given category.

Some representative works have been categorized according to their
approach and listed in Table II. A brief discussion of each category is

given below.

Surface Renewal Models

 

This category is of considerable historical interest especially the
original contributions of Higbie®® and Danckwerts. 3°

The so-called surface renewal models can be envisioned by imagining
the interface as being adjacent to a semi-infinite fluid through which
turbulent eddies having uniform concentrations characteristic of the
continuous phase, periodically penetrate to "renew" the surface. The
mass transfer then depends on the rate and depth of eddy penetration and
the eddy residence time near the surface (or the distribution of eddy
ages). For a given eddy, the original models are essentially solutions

of the diffusion equation

As shown by Toor and Marchello,®* the "film" model first introduced
by Whitman®® corresponds to the asymptotic solution of this equation at
long times (no surface renewal) where k would be proportional to $ and
Sherwood number would be independent of Schmidt number. The "penetra-
tion" model first introduced by Higbie®® and later extended by Danckwerts®®
corresponds to the asymptotic solution at short times where k would be
proportional to §/ 2 or Sh ~ Sc’ 2, Depending on the distribution of
contact times between the eddies and the surface, the transfer may take
on characteristics of either or both of the above.

King®® generalized this approach to include turbulence effects by

replacing Equation (4) with

2 _ 2 a
LT-L iru),

where Ho is an eddy diffusivity which he arbitrarily let vary with dis-

tance from the surface as

This model approaches the same asymptote (Sh ~ Sc*/ 2) at short times but
different asymptotes at long times depending on the value of b (with b =
3, Sh ~ Sc®*2%; with b = 4, Sh ~ 8c 28),

To establish an overall mass-transfer rate, it is necessary to
assign a frequency with which the surfaces are "renewed" (or the distri-
bution of eddy ages). The different extensions and modifications of
this model mostly involve the choice of different functions to describe
the randomness of the eddy penetrations. None of these models give
significant information as to the effect of bubble size, conduit size,

or Reynolds number, They are mechanistically unsatisfactory because the
14

hydrodynamic effects are often ignored or included by relating the eddy
age distribution in some way to the flow field. For example, Lamont and
Scott!® assumed that the fractional rate of surface renewal, s, (k ~ A885)
is given by

s ~ Re JE .
There is really no clear-cut way to establish a relationship between the
rate of surface renewal and the hydrodynamics and, consequently, there
is a heavy reliance on empiricism. The original intent of these models
was to describe transfer to a surface (bubble) that has a distinct steady

flow relative to the liquid.

Modeling of the Eddy Structure

 

If the fluid velocity field in the vicinity of the interface could
be completely described, then the computation of transfer rates, in
principal, would be straightforward. However, at the present time,
there are no satisfactory descriptions of the details of a turbulent
velocity field and even if such were available, the mathematical account-
ing of the differential transfer processes might become intractable.
Consequently, there have been idealizations of the eddy structure with,
admittedly, unrealistic fields and mass-transfer behavior has been conm-
puted based on these idealizations.

Lamont's work! provides an excellent example of this approach. He
modeled the eddy structure by considering individual eddy cells that have
a sinusoidal form at a sufficient distance away from the interface
(corresponding perhaps to an individual component of a Fourier decompo-
sition of the turbulent field). As the interface is approached, viscous

forces dampen the eddy cell velocities by an amount that depends on the
15
interfacial condition (mobile or rigid). Lamont calculated the mass-
transfer coefficient for an individual eddy cell as a function of the
dauping condition, fluid properties, the wave properties, and the eddy
energy. He then used a Kovasznay distribution function for the energy
spectrum and summed over a range of wave numbers to obtain the overall
coefficient, The results of this procedure were
k ~ (sc) 2 (e 0)
for a mobile interface and
kn (50)7% 2 (e)V
for a rigid interface.
Using Equation (1), these give
Sh ~ Scl/ 2 Re®-68°
and
Sh ~ Sel’ 3 Rel-6° ,
respectively.
The present writer feels that this approach may represent a bridge
between surface renewal models and turbulence theory and as such deserves

particular mention.

Turbulence Interactions

 

Some authors have attempted to analyze the forces and interactions
between spheres and fluid elements in a turbulent field to arrive at
equations for the fluctuating motion of the spheres. These equations
are solved to obtain a "mean" relative velocity between the bubble and
the fluid which is then substituted into a steady-flow equation (usually
of the Frossling type) to establish the mass-transfer coefficients. The

work of Levich®® is of this nature and Peebles® used this approach in
16

his document. For example, Peebles used the result of Hinze®” for small

gas bubbles

FE=3 FF

g

which essentially comes from an integration of the equation

av dv
md3 g md? £

where W is an added mass coefficient for an accelerating spherical

bubble. The relative velocity is then

Peebles used the approximations

Fr 2 ~ V.Je/2 and £ ~ Re"V/ ©

in the above which were then substituted into Frossling type equations
to obtain Sh ~ Re®*%® Sc! 2 (4/D)"Y 2 for a mobile interface and Sh ~
Re®*%% scl’ 2 (4/D)™Y 2 for a rigid interface.

In a similar computation which included Stokes law to describe the
drag experienced by the bubble, Levich®® obtained for a mobile interface

Sh ~ Re¥ 4 gc 2

Dimensional Analysis (Empiricism)

 

Some workers have chosen to postulate the physical variables that
may be controlling and have used standard dimensional analysis techniques
for ordering the experimental data, The paper by Middleman®® is a
splendid example of this approach as applied to agitated vessels. Also
for agitated vessels, Calderbank and Moo-Young®® used dimensional
analysis to obtain Equation (2) and Sherwood and Brian'”’ dimensionally

related sh, /sct/ to [e a/v] 2,
17

Also included under this category is a most interesting correlation
by Figueiredo and Charles!® for a heterogeneous pipeline flow of settling
particles. They used an expression for the ratio of pressure gradient
for flow of the suspension to the pressure gradient for flow of the
liquid alone and assumed that, if altered by the ratio a/D, it could
also represent the ratio of mass-transfer coefficients for the particles
to those for transfer from the liquid to the pipe wall, They found that
they could, indeed, use this ratio to correlate their data for a settling

suspension with the data of Harriot and Hamilton, 3°

Discussion

It is seen that the theoretical description of mass transfer to
bubbles in cocurrent turbulent flow has by no means been standardized.
There seems to be somewhat general agreement as to the effect of Schmidt
number, The Sherwood numbers for cases of completely rigid interfaces
with zero tangential velocity at the surface (no slip) applicable to
solid spheres, very small bubbles, and bubbles with surfactant contami-
nation in the interface are generally predicted to vary with Schmidt
number to the one-third power. Completely mobile interfaces (negligible
tangential stress with non-zero interfacial velocity) are generally pre-
dicted to yield a Sc!’ 2 variation of Sh.

There is only scant and inconsistent information predicting the
effects of bubble and conduit diameter. For example, Levich predicts
no effect of d/D while Peebles predicts Sh ~ (d/D)7Y 2,

There is general disagreement as to the effect of Reynolds number

as evidenced by the fact that exponents have been predicted that range
18
from 0.45 to > 1, These different exponents may not be mutually exclusive
however because an inspection of the experimental data shows disagreement
in the measured exponents also, It may be that the proper application of
these equations depends on suitable evaluation of the conditions of the

experiment.
CHAPTER III
DESCRIPTION OF EXPERIMENT

This experiment was designed to measure liquid phase controlled
mass-transfer coefficients for cocurrent pipeline flow of turbulent
liquids with up to 1% volume fraction of small helium bubbles having
mean diameters from 0.01 to 0.05 inches, The liquids chosen were five
mixtures of glycerine and water (0, 12.5, 25, 37.5, and 50% by weight
of glycerine) each of which represent a different Schmidt number. The
physical properties of these mixtures, obtained from the literature,®®
are shown graphically in Appendix A and the values used in this study

for the given mixtures are listed in Table IIT.
Transient Response Technique

A closed recirculating system was used in which helium bubbles
were introduced (generated) at the entrance of a well-defined test
section and removed richer in oxygen at the exit, allowing only the
bubble-free liquid to recirculate,

The products of mass-transfer coefficients and interfacial areas
were measured by a transient response technique in which the system was
initially charged with dissolved oxygen. The oxygen was then progress-
ively removed by transfer to the helium bubbles while the oxygen concen-
tration was continuously monitored as a function of time at a single
position in the system.

For a test section of length, L, and cross-sectional area, A, it
can be shown (Appendix B) that the ratio of exit concentration to inlet

where

RTQ
v = 4 ond 8 = kaAL(1 + v) (5b)

 

In the absence of axial smearing, each time the fluid makes a com-
plete passage around the closed circuit (loop transit time, 7, = v./Q,)
the concentration at the measuring position would (ideally) decrease
instantaneously from its value, C, to a value equal to KC. Therefore,
in actuality, the ratio, c/c,, of the concentration at any time to that
at an initial reference time (set equal to zero) would be given by

c/c, = Exp - Ei t | = Exp EAL .
L L S -
Therefore a plot of on (c/c,) versus time would be a straight line of
slope -(nx)a,/v_. Note that the absolute value need not be measured
because a signal that is merely proportional to the oxygen concentration
would have the same slope. If the system volume, Vs and the liquid

volumetric flow rate, Q,, have been measured, the constant K can be

2°
extracted from the slope of the measured transient. Having a measure
also of gas volumetric flow, Ago and the system absolute temperature, T,
and knowing R, H, A, and L, the product, ka, can be obtained from K

through Equations (5). If an independent measure is also made of "a,"

then the mass-transfer coefficients are fully determinable.
22

This technique was selected as being superior to a once-through
test that requires an independent measurement of the oxygen concentra-
tion at both ends of the test section for reasons illustrated by the
following comparison.

In a once-through system with a 37.5% mixture and conservative
values of Q,/e, = 1%, bubble mean diameter = 0.01 inches, Reynolds
number = 6 x 10%, and a mass-transfer coefficient of 0.7 ft/hr, a test
section length of ~100 feet would be required to obtain a concentration
change across the test section of only

c/c, = 0.9 .

At this level a small error in the concentration measurement would be
magnified in the determination of ka. In contrast, the same conditions
in a transient test with only a 25-ft-long test section would give a
concentration change of c/c, ~ 0.1 in only about seven minutes — greatly
reducing the error magnification in ka. In return for this benefit, the
values of total system volume, Ves and the time coordinate, t, need also
to be measured, These, however, are parameters that can be measured
very precisely compared to the concentration measurement. Therefore,
the transient tests should result in more reliable data.

On the other hand, the concentrations in once-through tests are
measured at specific locations that bracket the region of interest and
only the transport behavior within that region is important. Whereas in
the transient tests all mass transfer occuring outside the test section
is extraneous and represents an "end effect" contribution that must be
independently measured and accounted for in determining the "ka" product.

This "end effect," which would include mass transfer occuring in the
23
bubble generating and separating processes, represents the most serious
disadvantage and error source in the transient measurements. The
measurement and accounting for the "end effect” are discussed further

on page U7.
Apparatus

In constructing the main circulating systems of the experiment
exclusive use was made of stainless steel or glass hardware and all
gaskets were Teflon. This was part of careful measures taken to keep
the system free of contamination. Figure 1 is a photograph of the
facility with the test section mounted in the vertical orientation and
Figure 2 is a diagram of the main circuit portion. Figure 28, page 121
(Appendix C) is an instrument application drawing of the system which
includes an auxiliary flow circuit used for rotameter calibration and
for special tests,

The main circuit consisted of a canned rotor centrifugal pump,
three parallel rotameters, a heat exchanger, three dissolved oxygen
measuring sensors, a helium flow and metering system, a bubble generator,
the test section, a bubble separator, a photographic arrangement for
determining the bubble interfacial areas and mean diameters, and a
drain-and-fill tank equipped with scales for precise determination of
the weight percent of glycerine in the mixture. Further descriptions

of individual components are given below.

about 180 feet of head. The motor cannings, housing, and impeller were
stainless steel and the bearings were graphitar — lubricated solely by
the loop fluid. An auxiliary circuit required to cool the pump motor
windings circulated transformer oil through the windings and through an
external circuit containing an auxiliary oil pump, a filter, and a small
water-cooled heat exchanger, The pump was safety instrumented to turn
off on loss of pressure in the oil circuit or on high temperature of

the motor housing.

Liquid Flow Measurement

 

The liquid flow rate was controlled by three parallel stainless
steel globe valves downstream of the pump at the entrances to the rota-
meters. Three parallel rotameters of different capacities (100, ko,
and 8 gpm) were used for measuring liquid volumetric flow rates. By
judicious use of the rotameter scales, parallel rotameters provide
greater precision when measurements are required over a wide flow range.
In each experiment, however, some flow was allowed to go through each
rotameter to prevent having regions that might "lag" the rest of the
loop during the transient tests and thereby become concentration
"capacitance" volumes.

Because of the large differences in viscosities over the range of
glycerine-water mixtures used, the rotameters were calibrated, in place,
for both water and a 50% mixture. These calibrations were obtained by
the use of two identical 6-inch-diameter, 6-feet-long glass tanks in
the auxiliary circuit valved together in such a way that, while one was
being filled, the other was being drained. Changing the position of one

lever reversed the process before the liquid could spill over the top.
27
The time required to fill (or empty) a known volume of either of these
tanks was measured over the entire range of each rotameter. These cal-
ibrations are given in Appendix D.
Since there was only a small difference in the calibration between
0 to 50% glycerine, the flow for in-between mixtures was determined by

linearly interpolating between the two curves according to the viscosity.

Temperature Stabilization

The fluid temperature was measured at the inlet and exit of the test
section by standard stainless steel sheathed chromel-alumel thermocouples
immersed in the fluid, The friction and pump heat were removed and the
test section temperature held at 25°C for all tests by a stainless-steel,

water-cooled, shell-and-tube heat exchanger.

Gas Flow Measurement

Helium for generation of the bubbles was obtained from standard
commercial cylinders metered through a pressure regulator, a safety
relief valve, and a flow control needle valve, The rate of helium flow
was determined by measuring both the exit pressure and the pressure drop
across a 6-foot length of tubing of about 1/16-inch internal diameter.
These measurements were made with a Bourden type pressure gage and a
water-filled U-tube manometer, respectively.

Calibration at atmospheric conditions was obtained prior to opera-
tion by comparing with readings from a wet-test meter timed with a stop
watch, The calibration at 50 psig exit pressure (normal operating con-

dition) is given in Figure 33, page 127 (Appendix D). The calibration
28
and the leak tightness of this system were checked periodically over

the course of the experimental program.

Dissolved Oxygen Measurement

 

Two identical commercially available "Polarographic" type instru-
ments were used to measure the dissolved oxygen concentration (Magna
Oxymeter Model 1070, Magna Corporation-Instrument Division, 11808 South
Bloomfield Avenue, Santa Fe Springs, California). Two were used so
that an automatic continuous check was provided by comparing the readings
of one with the other. It was felt unlikely that both would use up
their electrolyte or fail simultaneously. These instruments used polar-
ographic type sensors inserted into the flowing liquid through penetra-
tions in tees provided for that purpose. Electrical signals produced
by the sensors were fed through recording adaptors and the resulting
millivolt signals recorded on a Brown Multipoint recorder having a
measured chart speed of 1.18 inches/sec.

Each sensor assembly consisted of an electrolytic cell made up of
a cathode, anode, and an electrolyte mounted in a plastic cylindrical
housing. The end of the housing, containing the cell, was encased in
a thin oxygen-permeable Teflon membrane which also acted to contain the
electrolyte. The dissolved oxygen is electrolytically reduced at the
cathode causing a current to flow through the system from cathode to
anode. The magnitude of this current is proportional to the oxygen
concentration if sufficient liquid velocity exists (~2 ft/sec) to pre-

vent concentration polarization at the membrane,
29

The response times for these instruments are greater than 90% in
30 seconds. An analysis showing that this response produces an accept-
able error in the transient tests is given in Appendix E.

Since the transient response technique used in these tests requires
a signal that is merely proportional to the oxygen concentration, an
absolute calibration of these instruments was not necessary. Neverthe-
less calibration tests were made for two different mixtures of glycerine
and water by bubbling air through the mixtures at different pressures
until they became saturated. Knowing the solubility of oxygen in the
mixtures, the meter reading could be set on the calculated concentration
for an initial "set-point" pressure and subsequent readings at different
pressures compared with calculated values (assuming a Henry's Law rela-
tionship), Calibrations obtained in this manner are shown on Figure 3U,
page 128 (Appendix D) which includes readings made with a third instru-
ment similar to the Magna instruments but made by a different company.
The response speed of this third sensor proved to be slow compared to
the Magna sensors and consequently it was used only as an independent
monitor on the operability of the Magna sensors throughout these experi-

ments,

Bubble Generation

Special apparatus was required that could generate a dispersion of
small bubbles whose mean size could be controlled and varied over the
range 0.01 to 0.05 inches independently of the particular liquid mixture
being used and of the flow rates of gas and liquid. Two devices con-
sidered and discarded as being inadequate were (1) a fine porosity

fritted glass disc through which the gas was blown into the liquid, and
30
(2) two parallel stainless steel discs, a rotor and a stator, each
equipped with intermingling blades. The gas-liquid mixture flowed
between the blades and the gas was broken into fine bubbles by the
shearing action.

The bubble generator designed and developed for this project is
shown diagrammatically on Figure 3. The liquid flowed through a con-
verging diverging nozzle with a l-inch-diameter throat and a 2-inch-
diameter entrance and exit. The section downstream of the throat
diverged at an angle of about 12 degrees. A central "plumb-bob" shaped
probe of maximum cross-sectional diameter of ~0.812 inches was movable
and could be centrally positioned anywhere in the diverging section
including the throat and exit. This probe was supported by a tube which
carried the gas into the system. The tube, in turn, was supported by a
"Swagelok" fitting penetrating a flange on the end of the straight leg
of a tee connected to the nozzle entrance, Four small positioning rods
near the throat centered the probe within the nozzle and helped support
it, They also acted as holders for a section of "honey-comb" straighten-
ing vanes used to minimize the liquid swirl induced by the right angle
turn at the tee entrance to the nozzle,

Gas entered the liquid through 48 holes (1/6L-inch-diameter) around
the probe periphery at its maximum thickness and exited as a series of
parallel plumes which were broken into individual bubbles by the turbu-
lence in the diverging section of the nozzle. The mean bubble size for
a given flow and mixture was controlled by the position of the probe
within the nozzle (the closer the probe was to the throat the smaller

the mean bubble size produced).

Bubbles generated by this device were found to follow closely a
size distribution function proposed by Bayens®® and previously used to
describe droplet sizes produced in spray nozzles.

The function, defined as f(8)dé = that fraction of the total number
of bubbles that have diameters, 6, lying in the range 6 * 1/2 dé, is
given by

An indication of the suitability of this distribution function is
given in Figure 4 where measured cumulative size distributions for
bubble populations produced by the bubble generator are compared
with the distributions calculated from the function at different liquid
flows and different ratios of gas to liquid flows. The measured distri-
butions were obtained by painstakingly scaling the sizes of a sufficient
number of bubbles directly off photographs taken of the bubble swarms at
each condition, These measured areas should be accurate within about
10%.

The range of mean bubble sizes capable of being produced by this
bubble generator were measured at a constant gas-to-liquid volumetric
flow ratio, Q/Qys of 0.3% at different liquid flow rates, different

mixtures of glycerine and water, and different probe positions.

Bubble Separation

Since this project uses the transient mode of testing, bubbles that
recirculate and extract dissolved oxygen from the liquid in regions out-
side the test section constitute an error source in the measurements.
Consequently a high degree of separation is desirable for this method
of testing. Some techniques considered were (1) gravitational separa-
tion in a tank, (2) centrifugal separation through the use of vanes to
induce a strong vortex, and (3) separation by flowing through a porous
metal which might act as a physical barrier to the bubbles. Each of
these had shortcomings that prevented their use in this project. For
example, with gravitational separation the tank size required for the
viscous mixtures was ponderously large. This increases the system
volume resulting in a "sluggish" loop and an accompanying increase in
the measurement error.

With centrifugal separation there were problems in stabilizing the
gaseous core of the vortex over a wide range of operating conditions.

In addition, large by-pass of bubbles (inefficient separation) was
observed and there was too much liquid carryover through the gas removal

duct.
35

The porous physical barriers tested required large frontal areas
or had prohibitive pressure drops, and the bubbles were observed to
regularly penetrate these barriers,

A satisfactory separator was finally developed that combined fea-
tures of each of the above. A diagram of this separator is shown on
Figure 5. The liquid-bubble mixtures entered the bottom of a 6-inch-
diameter pipe. A series of plexiglas vanes just beyond this entrance
created a swirl flow within the tank which tended to force the bubbles
to the middle, The spinning mixture flowed upward into a converging
cone-shaped region with sides of 500-mesh stainless steel screen. When
wetted by the liquid, the screen acted as a physical barrier to the
bubbles but allowed the liquid to pass through. The liquid exited from
the separator while the bubbles continued to rise through the truncated
end of the conical screen to an interface where the gas was vented
through a small exit line, The system pressure level was also con-
trolled at this interface by providing an auxiliary sweep of helium
through the exit line,

Good separation was achieved with this apparatus over the test con-
ditions of this thesis. No bubbles could be detected in photographs
taken downstream of the separator. However, with the use of a light
beam, some bubbles that appeared to be smaller than the screen mesh
size could be detected visually. After passing through the pump and
entering a higher pressure region these bubbles apparently went into
solution because they could no longer be visually detected downstream
of that region. If indeed they did go into solution along with their

small amount of extracted oxygen, they would have hardly constituted

a significant error in the mass-transfer measurements. Nevertheless,
several "special tests were made in which about 10% of the normal gas
flow was purposely introduced downstream of the separator and allowed
to recirculate. The measured rates of change in loop concentration
under these conditions were always less than 3% of the normal rate and
the effect of the apparently much smaller amounts of by-pass therefore
were felt to be acceptable.

This separator was the major factor in limiting the ranges of
Reynolds numbers that could be obtained in this system. For a given
mixture, as flow was increased a flow rate was eventually reached at
which there was an observed "breakthrough" of many large bubbles that
would continue to recirculate. At this level of flow it was necessary
to terminate the tests with the particular mixture.

In addition to the flow limiting aspect of the separator, an
unexpected large amount of mass transfer occurred there — probably due
to the energy dissipation of the swirl and the relatively large amount
of contact time between the liquid and gas. Consequently a larger than

anticipated "end effect” resulted that had to be accounted for in deter-
mining the mass-transfer coefficients applicable to the test section

only. This correction resulted in decreased reliability of the results.

Test Section

The test section was considered as that portion of conduit between
the bubble generator exit and the entrance of an elbow leading into the
separator entrance pipe (see Figure 1, page 24). It consisted of five
sections of 2-inch-diameter conduit flanged together with Teflon gaskets,

As encountered in the direction of flow these were a 4-foot-long section
38

of glass pipe, a 10-foot-long section of glass pipe, a 6 1/2-foot-long
section of stainless steel "long-radius" U-bend, another 10-foot-long
section of glass pipe, and a 5-foot-long section of glass pipe, for a
total of 35 1/2 feet of length. The test section and bubble generator
were connected to the rest of the loop piping through the bubble gener-
ator tee at the entrance and an elbow at the exit which served as pivot
points to permit the test section to be mounted in any orientation from

horizontal to vertical,
Bubble Surface Area Determination — Photographic System

The mean sizes and interfacial areas per unit volume of the bubble
dispersions were determined photographically using a Polaroid camera and
two Strobolume flash units, To reduce distortion the photographs were
taken through rectangular glass ports fitted around the cylindrical
glass conduit and filled with a liquid having the same index of refrac-
tion as the glass. The port for "inlet" pictures was located about one
foot downstream from the bubble generator exit and the "exit" port was
located about two feet upstream from the test section exit.

The Polaroid camera was equipped with a specially made telescopic
lens that permitted taking photographs in good focus across the entire
cross section of the conduit. The camera was semi-permanently mounted
onto the facility structure in such a manner that photographs could be
taken at the "inlet" port and then the camera pivoted for taking a sub-
sequent picture through the "exit" port. For vertical orientation of

the test section, photographs were taken directly through the ports.
39
For horizontal tests, the camera remained in its "vertical orientation"
position and the photographs were taken through high quality front sur-
face mirrors.

With the camera focused along the axis of the conduit, bubbles
closer to the camera appear larger and those further away appear smaller.
To determine the magnitude of this possible error source, small wires of
known diameter were mounted inside the conduit across the cross section.
Photographs obtained after focusing on the central wire indicated less
than one percent maximum error in the apparent diameter reading.

The Strobolume flash units (one for each port) produced pictures
of best contrast when mounted to provide diffuse back lighting in which
the lights were aimed directly into the camera lens from behind the photo
ports, Semi-opaque "milky" plexiglas sheets between the lights and the
photo ports served as the light diffusers.

Bubble diameters could have been scaled directly off the photographs
for each run and used to establish the interfacial areas and mean diame-
ters just as was done to validate the bubble size distribution function.
However, this proved to be such an onerous and time-consuming procedure
that it would have been prohibitive due to the large number of experi-
mental runs and need for at least two photographs for each run, Conse-
quently, the following use was made of the distribution function,

Therefore, by measuring the volume fraction, &, it was only necessary
to count the number of bubbles per unit volume from the photographs and
use Equation (10) to establish the areas. Equation (9) was then used to
determine the mean bubble diameters. Counting the number of bubbles in
a representative area of the photographs was a considerably easier task
than measuring the actual sizes of each bubble. However, it was then
necessary to have an independent determination of the volume fraction
occupied by the bubbles.

For p >> Py? Equation (11) reduces to

hl
Hughmark's correlation for X at sufficiently large Z is nearly flat
with X changing from 0.7 to 0.9 over a 10~fold change in Z. For the
conditions of the experiments in this report, X was considered to be
constant at an average value of 0,73.
When volume fractions were measured in the vertical flow tests,
it was found that

gave a good measure of the mean value for a given test but that the
volume fractions were sometimes considerably smaller than this in the
riser leg of the test section and, at the same time, comparably larger
in the downcomer. It was apparent that this difference was due to
buoyancy driven relative flow between the bubbles and the liquid.
Separate volume fractions were therefore determined for each leg based
on a mass balance, This mass balance between the riser and downcomer

sections in a constant area conduit takes the form

End Effect

In the transient response mode of operation all mass transfer
occuring outside the test section (principally in the bubble separator
and generator) must be independently measured and accounted for in
establishing the ka products applicable only to the test section.

"End-effect" measurements were made after all other scheduled tests
were completed by moving the bubble generator to a position at the test
section exit which allowed the bubbles to flow directly from the genera-
tor into the separator — effectively by-passing the test section. All

tests were then repeated duplicating as nearly as possible the original

 

conditions, With the end-effect response so measured, the correction
was determined as follows,

Consider three regions of mass transfer in series representing the
bubble generator (Region 1), the test section (Region 2), and the bubble
separator (Region 3). The original measurements, indicated here by a
subscript "I," determined the ratio, Ko of the outlet to inlet concen-
tration across all three regions. Therefore

Ki =K Kg Ka 3

where K,, Kg, and Ks are the outlet and inlet concentration ratios across

the individual regions.

An estimate of the error involved in this procedure is given in Appendix

Summary of Experimental Procedure

The mode of experimentation was transient with the independent
variables being Schmidt number (depending on percent glycerine in
glycerine-water mixtures), Reynolds number (liquid flow), bubble mean
diameter (controlled by bubble generator probe position), and test sec-
tion orientation (vertical or horizontal). Other parameters that were
held constant for most of these tests include the test section conduit
diameter (D = 2 inches), the ratio of gas to liquid volumetric flow
(a /q, = 0.3%) and the fluid temperature (25°C).

It was found that the only effect of volume fraction up to 1% was
in the highly predictable change in surface area. No significant
difference was detected in the mass-transfer coefficients themselves
which are on a unit area basis. Consequently with the exception of
some of the early runs most of the experiments were performed at a con-
venient volume fraction of 0.3%. In addition it was found that for the

distilled water runs (no glycerine) the rapid agglomeration of the
50
bubbles at the flows obtainable prevented meaningful interpretation of
the data. Consequently all water tests were performed with the addition
of about 200 ppm of normal butyl alcohol which effectively inhibited the
agglomeration but may have resulted in a different surface condition
compared to the other mixtures. The addition of this same amount of
N-butyl alcohol to the glycerine-water mixtures made no significant
difference,

For a given liquid mixture and orientation of the test section, the
procedure followed to obtain a series of data is outlined in detail
below:

1. The loop was first purged repeatedly with distilled water to
remove residual liquid from previous experiments and the system allowed
to dry by blowing air through it overnight.

2, The mixture of glycerine and water to be used was precisely
made up in the weigh tank and then thoroughly mixed by vigorous stirring
produced by pumping the liquid from the bottom of the tank back into the
top.

3. The loop was filled using a small auxiliary pump and the systen
operating pressure was set at a nominal 40 psia by helium pressure over
the interface in the bubble separator.

4, Liquid flow was established by energizing the main loop circu-
lator and the flow was set at the desired level by throttling through
all three rotameters.

5. The system was charged with oxygen to about seven or eight
parts per million by passing oxygen bubbles through the bubble generator,

the test section, and the bubble separator. The system was allowed to
ol
run a sufficient time after the oxygen flow had been terminated to
insure that the concentration readings were steady.

6. The bubble generator probe position was set to obtain the
first desired mean bubble diameter for the given test conditions.

7. The helium flow, having been preset to give Q/% = 0.3% at
the given liquid flow, was turned on initiating the transient experiment
which was usually allowed to continue for 10 to 15 minutes.

8. The oxygen concentration was continuously recorded and data
sheet loggings were made of liquid flow through each rotameter, test
section inlet pressure, test section pressure drop, helium pressure
at the capillary tube exit, pressure drop across the capillary tube,
loop temperature, bubble generator probe position, and atmospheric
pressure.

9. About midway through the transient for each test, a Polaroid
picture of the bubbles was made through one cf the photo ports (entrance
or exit) and then the camera was pivoted and a picture taken through the
other photo port.

10, For the given liquid flow, the bubble generator probe position
was varied to produce different mean diameters. Five values were desired
and usually obtained. For each position the above procedure (5-9) was
repeated. Occasionally to produce extra large bubbles, the gas was
introduced through the test-section inlet pressure tap — bypassing the
bubble generator itself.

11. The liquid flow was varied over the desired range and the above

procedure (5-10) was repeated for each flow setting.
52

Typical transient data of me/c versus time taken directly from
the oxygen concentration recording chart is shown on Figure 9 which
illustrates the constancy of the slope (nk, Q,/V).

The system volume had been previously measured to be ~2.52 £12 by
filling the system completely with water which was then collected and
weighed. Using this and the measured values of Qy the constants K;
were determined from the slopes of the curves.

After all vertical and horizontal tests were completed, "end effects"
were measured by moving the bubble generator to the test section exit and

repeating each experiment with the original conditions duplicated as

nearly as possible.

1

The values of K__. were then calculated from the slopes of the "end

II

effect" curves and K's were calculated from
K=K/Kp
The products, ka, were extracted from K through Equations (5).

The bubble photographs were analyzed to obtain the interfacial
areas per unit volume and the mean diameters. Typical examples of an
inlet and exit photograph are shown on Figure 10. The outlined regions
were used as the sample populations for counting the number of bubbles
per unit volume, N.

The applicable volume fraction correlation [either Equations (13),
(14), or (15)] was used to determine & and Equations (10) and (9) were
used to calculate the interfacial areas per unit volume and the mean
bubble diameters, respectively. Finally, the averages of the inlet and

exit areas were used to extract k from the ka products.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

The experimentally measured mass-transfer transients initially were
converted into pseudo mass-transfer coefficients without any adjustment
being made for mass-transfer occurring outside the test section, The
results thus obtained are not the true mass-transfer coefficients
because significant mass transfer occurred in the bubble generating and
separating equipment. Nevertheless, considerable information can be
gathered from this "unadjusted" data because of its presumed greater
precision. The true mass-transfer coefficients with extraneous mass-

transfer effects accounted for are presented later in this Chapter.
Unadjusted Results

The "unadjusted" mass-transfer coefficients determined as outlined
in Chapter III as functions of bubble mean diameter, Reynolds number,
orientation of the test section, and Schmidt number are given in Appendix
H (Figures 35-iL, pages 138-147).

The "raw" data which consists of recorder charts of oxygen concen-
tration versus time, innumerable photographs of bubble populations, and
log book records of flows, probe settings, temperature, pressure and
other conditions are on file in the Heat Transfer-Fluid Dynamics Depart-
ment, Reactor Division of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and are
available upon request.

It is instructive to consider the crossplots (Figures 45-49, pages
148-152), Similar to Lamont's'' results, the horizontal and the vertical

55
56
flow values were identical above sufficiently high Reynolds numbers. As
flows were decreased below these Reynolds numbers, however, the vertical
flow coefficients were larger than the horizontal flow coefficients and
seemed to asymptotically approach constant values. The horizontal flow
data, on the other hand, continued along straight line variations (on
log-log coordinates) until either the flow was too low to prevent con-
centration polarization at the oxygen sensors or in some cases severe
stratification of the bubbles prevented further testing. The pertinent
results to be considered, based on these unadjusted data, are the values
of the Reynolds number at which vertical and horizontal flow results
become identical and the apparent asymptotes approached by the vertical
flow coefficients at low flows, Mass transfer occurring outside the
test section should not affect either of these and their values should be
the same as for the data presented later that represents the true mass-

transfer coefficients.

Equivalence of Horizontal and Vertical Flow Mass Transfer

 

It seems evident that gravitational forces (buoyancy) tend to
establish a steady relative flow between the bubbles and the liquid if
the bubbles are free to move in the vertical direction (as they would
be in vertical orientations of the test sections) and are not restricted
by physical boundaries (as they would be in horizontal orientations).
The bubbles are also acted upon by inertial forces generated by the
turbulent motions within the liquid. These turbulent inertial forces
are randomly directed and thus tend, on the average, to counteract the
gravitational forces. Therefore it would be reasonable to assume that

if the magnitudes of the turbulent inertial forces, F.» were known
57
compared to the gravitational forces, Fos then their ratio, F/R would
be a measure of the relative importance of these forces in establishing
the mass-transfer coefficients. At sufficiently high values of F,/F,
one would expect the turbulent forces to dominate and there should then
be no detectable difference in the horizontal and vertical flow results,

The turbulent inertial force exerted on a bubble essentially
traveling at the local fluid velocity in a turbulent liquid is not so
easily determined. Consequently, use was made of dimensional arguments.

distance, A, (greater than the microscale) is given dimensionally by

Since Equation (20) was established on dimensional grounds, there

become identical, use was made of the data of Lamont gathered from his

report as listed in Table VI below.

It is seen that the ratio F IF, seems to be a good predictor for

the equivalence of the horizontal and vertical results.

Vertical Orientation Low-Flow Asymptotes

 

As liquid flow is reduced, the gravitational forces become more and
more dominant over the turbulent inertial forces. Consequently, at low
flows, the vertical flow mass-transfer coefficients approach the values
that would be expected for the bubbles rising through a quiescent liquid.

The conditions of mass transfer for bubbles rising through a column
of liquid have been extensively studied (e.g., References 26-30).

and used to determine the "calculated asymptotes" for the vertical flow

results as indicated on the various data plots.
Mass-Transfer Coefficients

With the end-effect accounted for as outlined in Chapter ITI, the
mass-transfer coefficients measured in this investigation are given in

Figures 50-58, pages 153-161 (Appendix G). The more revealing crossplots
61
of mass-transfer coefficients versus Reynolds number are shown in
Figures 11-15 which contain regression lines fitted to the horizontal
flow data and calculated lines for the vertical flow cases. Vertical
flow data are not shown for the 37.5% mixture because the end effect
adjustments were not satisfactory. Excessive vibration of the bubble
generation probe that occurred during the 37.5% experiments was elimi-
nated by redesign of the probe before the horizontal data were obtained.
Time did not permit a reorientation of the system to the vertical posi=-
tion to repeat the runs.

From these figures it is seen that the horizontal flow data for
water (plus N-butyl alcohol) apparently have a lesser slope than that
for the glycerine-water mixtures. Therefore a regression equation was
determined for the water runs alone and a separate regression equation
was determined for the combined data for the 12.5, 25, and 37.5%
glycerine mixtures. A third behavior was observed for the 50% glycerine
mixture (Figure 15). It is seen that all the data for this mixture were
obtained at Reynolds numbers less than that required for F,/F, = 1.5.
However, instead of a steady march of the horizontal flow data down a
straight line as observed for the other mixtures, the small bubble
horizontal flow mass-transfer coefficients tended to behave like those
for vertical flows. This behavior implies that, if the liquid is viscous
enough, small bubbles apparently can establish steady relative flow con-
ditions in their rise across the conduit cross section. In these runs,
the pipe wall apparently did not significantly inhibit the bubble rise
rate during transit through the test section and, evidently, the bubbles

behaved exactly as if they were rising through a vertical conduit.

These three kinds of observed horizontal flow behavior are further
illustrated on Figure 16 for 0.02-in, mean diameter bubbles. The
regression slope of 0,94 for the glycerine-water mixtures agrees gener-
ally with the literature as discussed in Chapter II and the slope of
0.52 for the water plus N-butyl alcohol is, coincidentally, exactly what
Lamont found. However, the combined regression slope (0.79) for all the
water data which includes the other pubble mean diameters was greater

than the value for the 0,02-in. bubbles by themselves.

Calculating Vertical Flow Mass-Transfer Coefficients

 

for Fi/Fg Less Than 1.5

 

Since the ratio of turbulent inertial forces to gravitational
forces is seen to be a good predictor of the Reynolds number at which
horizontal and vertical flow mass-transfer coefficients become identical,
it is proposed that the varying ratio might also serve as a scaling
factor at all Reynolds numbers to determine the relative importance of
the purely turbulent coefficients (7,/F, > 1.5) and the relative flow
coefficients (vertical flow asymptotes). That is, if the values are
known for the straight line variation at higher Reynolds numbers where
vertical and horizontal coefficients are equal along with the vertical
flow asymptotes, it is proposed that the intermediate vertical flow
mass-transfer coefficients can be calculated by using F,/F, as a linear
scaling factor between the two. Since F/T, = 1.5 appears to mark the
Reynolds numbers at which turbulent inertial forces dominate over gravi-
tational forces, the actual ratio of forces at that condition are

assumed to be of the order of 10 to 1 for gravitational forces to begin

Using separate regression lines for k the vertical flow mass-
transfer coefficients calculated from Equation (22) are compared with
the data on Figures 11-15, pages 62-66, Except for the 50% mixture data,

Equation (22) provides a relatively good description of the data.

Comparison with Agitated Vessels

A comparison of the horizontal flow data with that of Sherwood and
Brian!” for particulates in agitated vessels is shown on Figure 17.
Sherwood and Brian's coordinates are used by converting €n (= e,/p)
through Equation (19) for flow in conduits. It is seen that, although
the relative magnitudes of the coefficients are comparable on an equiva-
lent power dissipation basis, there is a Schmidt number separation of
this data indicating mobile interfacial behavior. In agreement with the
findings of other investigations reported in Chapter II, the variation
with Reynolds number for flow in conduits is much steeper than would
have been expected from the agitated vessel data.

A possible explanation for this difference in slope observed between
agitated vessels and flow in conduits may lie in the relative importance

of the gravitational forces. For example, the data of this research for

small bubbles in a 50% mixture of glycerine and water were obviously
strongly gravitationally dominated as evidenced by the equality of the
horizontal and vertical flow coefficients even at very low Reynolds

numbers. A comparison of these "gravity-influenced" data with Sherwood

and Brian's correlation shown on Figure 18 indicates a remarkable simi-

larity. It may be that gravitational forces are generally less important
for flow in conduits than for flow in agitated vessels where there may be

a greater degree of anisotropy.

Recommended Correlations

 

A regression line through all the horizontal flow data except the
water and the 50% mixtures has a Schmidt number exponent of 0.71 using
the literature®® values of §. These values of 8 (Figure 25, page 11h,
Appendix A) first increase with addition of glycerol, reach a maximum
at about 12.5% glycerol, and then decrease. This behavior represents a
striking departure from the Stokes-Einstein behavior usually observed
for aqueous mixtures. If, instead of using these values for £, a smooth
monotonically decreasing line is drawn through the first, fourth, and
fifth data points of Figure 25 and the values of § taken from that line,
a regression analysis yields a Schmidt number exponent of 0.58 — not
much different than the value of 0.5 expected for mobile interfaces.

A regression analysis of all the horizontal data for the glycerine-
water mixtures (except for the 50% mixture) using the original values of
0 (Table III, page 20) and forcing the Schmidt number to have an exponent

of 1/2 results in the equation,

with a standard deviation in on (Sh/Sc! 2) of 0.19 and an index of
determination of 0.86, The comparison of the data with this equation
is shown in Figure 19.

Since a Schmidt number exponent of 1/2 is expected on theoretical
grounds and since there is little loss of precision by using this
exponent, it 1s recommended for design purposes that the horizontal
flow mass-transfer coefficients, k , be calculated from Equation (23)
as long as v/v, is greater than about 3. Operation below V/V, = 3 is
not recommended because of severe stratification. Equation (23) can
also be used to calculate the vertical flow coefficients, kK os as long
as P/E as determined by Equation (20), is greater than 1.5. Other-
wise, Equation (22) is recommended for the vertical flow coefficients
with the asymptotic values, ks to be calculated from Equation (21).

As evidenced by the observed high Schmidt number exponent, these
recommendations are for contamination free systems only, For a con-
taminated system with rigid interfacial conditions, the Schmidt number
exponent is expected to be 1/3 and the coefficient multiplying the
equation should also be different, In the absence of supporting experi-
mental data, a tentative correlation for rigid interfacial conditions
might be inferred from Equation (23) to be

Sh = 0.25 Ref: 94 gel/ 8 (a, /D)*+° ]

The coefficient, 0.25, was obtained by multiplying 0.34 [the coeffi-
cient of Equation (23)] by the ratio of rigid-to-mobile coefficients of
equations applicable to bubbles moving steadily through a liquid.®! A
similar transformation of Equation (21) would be required to obtain the

rigid-interface values of the vertical flow asymptotes, The above

equation for rigid interfaces should be used with caution as it has not
been validated by experimental data, In addition the experimentally
observed linear variation with (a,./D) may have been caused by a transi-
tion from rigid-to-mobile interfacial condition. For strictly rigid
interfaces no such transition would be expected to occur and the exponent

on (a,./D) might then be less than 1.0,
CHAPTER V
THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS

Two different viewpoints were considered to describe mass transfer
between small bubbles and liquids in cocurrent turbulent flow. In the
first, a turbulence interaction approach, the bubbles were considered to
be subjected to turbulence forces which impart random motions resulting
in "mean" relative velocities between the bubbles and the fluid. These
"mean" velocities were then considered as "steady" (albeit multi-direc-
tional) and as dictating the mass-transfer behavior.

In the second, a surface renewal approach, the bubbles were viewed
as being associated with a spherical shell of liquid for an indefinite
time during which mass exchange takes place by turbulent diffusion.
This indefinite time was assumed to be related to the bubble size and

the average relative velocity between the bubble and the liquid.
Turbulence Interaction Model

A small bubble suspended in a turbulent field will be subjected to
random inertial forces created by the turbulent fluctuations, Under the
action of a given force, if sufficiently persistent, the bubble may
achieve its terminal velocity and move at a steady pace through the
liquid before being redirected by another force encounter within the
random field. If the "average value representing the bubble relative
velocity in such a turbulent field could be determined, then a convenient

formulation would be to use that velocity to determine an average bubble

76
7

Reynolds number and stay within the confines of the well-established
relative-flow Frossling-type equations to determine the mass-transfer
coefficients.

The movement of the bubbles through the liquid will be resisted
primarily by viscous stresses. The drag force on a sphere moving
steadily through a liquid is often expressed in terms of a drag coeffi-

cient, Cas by the equation,

2 2 2

in which the drag coefficient is itself a function of the bubble
Reynolds number, Rey (= vy do/u). In relative flows, however, the drag
coefficient-Reynolds number correlation depends on the particular
Reynolds number range. Frequently, two regimes of flow are identified
with the division occurring at Rey ~ 2, Common correlations for the
drag coefficients in these two regimes are given below,

It might be reasonable to determine "mean" bubble velocities from a
balance between the inertial forces and the drag forces for later sub-

stitution into the FrOssling equations. If it is postulated that the
78

above two relative flow regimes also exist for bubbles in a turbulent
field, then two different sets of equations describing the mass transfer
will result. Since the inertial forces depend on the bubble size, a
dispersion of bubbles with a distribution of sizes may have bubbles in
either or both regimes simultaneously and the mass-transfer behavior
may be described by either set of equations or take on characteristics
of a combination of the two. The mass-transfer equations resulting for

the two separate regimes are discussed below.

Regime-1: Rep < 2
If the bubble motion were predominantly governed by the regime,
Re, S 2, the drag forces would be given by Equation (24-a), A balance

between the inertial and drag forces, F, = F., would then give for the

d
bubble Reynolds number

Re, ~ (4/D)¥ ® Ret B® (26)

By this formulation, the bubble relative flow Reynolds number
depends only on the ratio, a/p, and on the pipe Reynolds number which,
for a given bubble size, establish the turbulence level, The Sherwood
number for mass transfer can therefore be determined as a function of
these variables by substitution of Equation (26) into mass-transfer
equations that have been established as applicable to a sphere moving
through a liquid. These are the FrOssling-type equations which, for
large Schmidt numbers, usually take the forms

—~ 1/ 2 1/2

and

~ 1/ 2 1/3

for mobile and rigid interfaces, respectively. Making the conversion,
sh = (D/4d) Sh, , and substituting Equation (26) gives for the mobile and

rigid interface pipe Sherwood numbers applicable to cocurrent turbulent

flow,
Sh ~ Scl/ 2 Re®-°2 (a/D)Y/ 2 (27)
and
Sh ~ Sel’ 2 Re®*®2 (a4/D)V 2 , (28)
respectively.

Consequently, in this regime, the pipe Reynolds number exponent is
0.92. Tor comparison, the experimentally determined value for the
water-glycerine mixtures in this investigation was 0.94, The theoretical
bubble diameter dependence, (d/D)¥ 2, however is less than the experi-
mentally determined linear variation, Calderbank and Moo-Young® point
out that the linear variation they observed for bubbles in this size
range probably resulted from a transition from rigid to mobile inter-
facial conditions because small bubbles tend to universally behave as
rigid spheres while larger bubbles require the presence of sufficient
surface active ingredients to immobilize their surface,

If such a transition is the reason for the linear variation in this
instance also, then the effect of conduit diameter will be different
from that implied in Equation (23) which did not include actual varia-
tions in conduit diameter. Consequently, anticipated future experiments
with variations in the conduit diameter should help clarify the influence
of bubble mean diameter. In addition, exploratory experiments in this
study indicated that the linear variation did not continue up to larger

bubble sizes and may, therefore, be limited to the relatively narrow mean
80
diameter range of approximately 0.01 to 0.05 inches. At larger diameters,
the dependence tended to lessen until above mean diameters of about 0.08
inches where the Sherwood number appeared to decrease with increasing
bubble diameter. Since the bubble generator was not generally capable
of producing larger bubbles, further investigation of the bubble size

influence was not possible in this experiment.

Regime-2: Rep > 2

If the bubble motions were predominantly in the regime, Re > 2, the

b

drag forces would be given by Equation (24-b). The balance, F, = Fy

would then give

Re, ~ (4/D)% #2 Rett/ ®t | (29)

The relative-flow bubble Reynolds number in this regime still depends
on the variables that establish the turbulence level but that dependence
is different from that of Regime 1. When substituted into the Frodssling
equations for mobile and rigid interfaces, the results are

Sh ~ gel/ 2 ReC- 66 (a/D)=0-¥ 4-2
and
Sh ~ qel/ 3 Rel - 686 (a/p)-0- 4-2 R (30)
respectively.

For this regime the Reynolds number exponent is 0.66. Consequently,
if bubbles in cocurrent turbulent flow experience different flow regimes
similar to bubbles in relative flow, a transition would be expected at
higher pipe Reynolds numbers in which the Reynolds number exponent would

tend to become smaller. In the present experiments, the data for water

(plus ~200 ppm N-butyl alcohol) with no glycerine added was obtained at
81
the highest range of Reynolds numbers covered. The experimentally
measured Reynolds number exponent for the water runs was lower than for
the glycerine-water mixtures and compared favorably with the above
results. In addition, Equation (30) compares quite well with data for
particles in agitated vessels [for example see Equation (3)].

It is felt that the possible existence of different flow regimes
even in cocurrent turbulent flows is an important concept that, if
further developed, could help explain some of the apparent discrepancies
in the literature data. For example, this may explain the different
slopes observed in this study and may be the reason for observed differ-
ences between mass transfer in agitated vessels and in conduits, It is
more likely, however, that the latter difference is due to greater

gravitational influence in agitated vessels.
Surface Renewal Model

In this analysis each bubble is considered to be surrounded by, and
exchanging mass with, a spherical shell of turbulent liquid in which the
turbulence is isotropic.

In turbulent scalar transfer, the "Reynolds" term pC’, is often

assumed to be expressible with an eddy diffusivity, E, defined by

The view is now to be taken that, on the average, a bubble remains
associated with a spherical shell of liquid for some indefinite time
after which its surface is completely "renewed" — that is, associated
with an entirely different spherical shell of liquid that has an initial
uniform concentration characteristic of the bulk fluid. It is felt that
the times of association between the bubble and a given region of liquid
should be related to the magnitude of the turbulent inertial forces or
alternatively to the mean relative velocity between the bubble and the
liquid as established by the balance of the inertial and the viscous
resisting forces.

where C, is a proportionality constant of unknown magnitude but assumed

The above analysis is similar to normal surface renewal models in
that the dimensionless time period T, is analogous to a surface age.
There is no real basis for being able to relate T, to the flow hydrody-
namics or the surface conditions; however, it could be treated as a
parameter and the mass-transfer coefficients determined as a function
of this parameter. "Surface age" distributions could then be established
from the experimental data or specified arbitrarily just as they have
been in other surface renewal models. For example, one common assump-
tion has been that the surface is "renewed" each time the bubble travels
(relative to the fluid) a distance equal to its diameter. With the
formulation used here, this assumption would be particularly convenient

because then I, = 1.
85
Equation (35) along with its boundary conditions is considered as
a surface renewal model. For a solution, a function,

ho/8 (Re, Sc, d4/D, r,) ,

must first be established to describe the variation in eddy diffusivity.

In arriving at his eddy viscosity definition, Phillips®® used a
Fourier decomposition of the turbulent field and, by an elegant analysis,
determined the contributions to the local eddy viscosity due to each
component "wave" making up the field.

Through a parallel analysis for mass transfer, it is inferred here
that the individual component contributions to the eddy diffusivity are
proportional to the energy of the transverse velocity fluctuations and

inversely proportional to their wave number,

i ~ u?/n . (37)

e,n
Defining f(n)dn as the fraction of eddies that have wave numbers in
the range n + 1/2 dn, and summing the contributions over all wave numbers

gives

If Kolmolgoroff's energy spectrum is used, the distribution function
defined above can be assumed to be inversely proportional to the wave
number,
f(n) ~ 1/n ,
and Equation (38) becomes
bo ~ J (82/02) an | (39)
To assess the effect of the interface, use was made of Lamont's'!

analysis in which he idealized each component as a sinusoidal viscous
86
"eddy cell" in which the velocities are damped by viscous stresses as
an interface is approached. His analysis gave for a spacial average

(parallel to the interface),

-1/ 3

Bs

uw ~E (vy)

where y is a coordinate defined as y = r — a/2 and E(y) is a damping
factor depending on the interfacial condition. Lamont's solution of
the viscous "eddy-cell" equation gave for a rigid interface,

€. = [0.294 ny sinh ny + 0.388 sinh ny —0.388 ny cosh ny] ,

and for a mobile interface,

g = [0.366 sinh ny —0.089 ny cosh ny] .

In addition, it is assumed here that only the range of eddy sizes smaller
than, or equal to, the bubble diameter interact with a bubble to produce
eddy transfer to the bubble itself and that each of these eddies is
effectively damped only if it is within a distance from the interface
equal to the wave size, The eddy sizes assumed present range from a
minimum given by the Kolmolgoroff microscale for pipe flow,

n = D/RetV 18
min

to an arbitrary maximum of one-half the pipe diameter,

Mux = D/2 .

Consequently, using Equation (39), the ratio of eddy diffusivity effec
tive to the bubble at a position y to the eddy diffusivity existing away
from the interface, bok is calculated from the following relations:

A numerical integration of Equation (40) with Max = d is shown on
Figure 20 for both mobile and rigid damping.

The actual relative eddy diffusivity variation calculated from
Equation (40) will not approach unity in midstream as in Figure 20
because the integration of the numerator is to include only eddies up
to the size of the bubble diameter whereas the denominator is to be
integrated over all wave sizes in the field.

Comparing the mobile and rigid interface curves on Figure 20 indi-
cates that the two conditions would result in very little difference in
mass-transfer behavior for an essentially passive bubble being acted
upon simultaneously by many eddies — a result not too displeasing
intuitively. A significant difference in behavior then, by this
formulation, must come about by assigning a longer renewal period, T,,
to rigid interfaces than to mobile interfaces.

The variation of ho/® required for a solution to Equation (35) can

Phillip's definition of eddy viscosity reduces to the standard
definition in the midsection of a pipe. Consequently, it is acceptable

to convert Equation (43) to

function

It is realized that Phillip's analysis for eddy viscosity is not
strictly applicable near an interface nor is the "eddy-cell" idealization
a realistic picture of the turbulence. Nevertheless, the variation in
eddy diffusivity based on these concepts was determined through Equations
(43) and (LO), It is felt that the behavior of a pseudo-turbulence such
as this may be similar to a real turbulent field in that the essential
features are retained and the trends predicted in this manner may be
useful. For example, for the condition of turbulent transfer to a con-
duit wall itself there have been measurements of the standard eddy
diffusivity distributions. Therefore, a comparison was made in Figure

data,®® For this application of transfer to a conduit, the value of d
in Equation (40a) (the maximum eddy size in this case) was arbitrarily
set equal to 1/2 of the pipe radius, ros and the coefficient in Equation
(43) was adjusted slightly to require AY to coincide exactly with
Sleicher's value in the pipe midsection at Re = 14,500. Considering the
difference in the eddy diffusivity definitions, the comparison is favor-
able and it appears that use of a pseudo-turbulence idealization such as
this may provide a unique neans of predicting eddy viscosity and eddy
diffusivity variations. Since the determination of eddy diffusivities
and their variation was not the primary concern of this thesis, further
development of these concepts was not considered,

Equations (35), (36), (40), and (44), which represent the present
surface renewal model were programmed on a digital computer and numeri-
cal solutions obtained using T, as a parameter. Time did not permit a
complete evaluation of this computer program and the results can only
be presented here as tentative. Figure 22 illustrates the values of

renewal period, T,, is interpreted as being a measure of the rigidity
of the interface, T, + O being characteristic of mobile interfaces and
T, »~2.7 (in this case) being characteristic of rigid interfaces, then
this surface renewal model may be useful.

Neither this model nor the preceding turbulence interaction model
satisfactorily predict the observed variation of pipe Sherwood number
with bubble diameter for this range of bubble sizes. Indirect support
is therefore provided for the supposition that the observed linear
variation may be the result of a transition from rigid to mobile

behavior.
CHAPTER VI
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Transient response experiments were performed using five different
mixtures of glycerine and water. Liquid-phase-controlled mass-transfer
coefficients were determined for transfer of dissolved oxygen into small
helium bubbles in cocurrent turbulent gas-liquid flow. These coeffi-
cients were established as functions of Reynolds number, Schmidt number,
bubble mean diameter, and gravitational orientation of the flow,

An analytical expression was obtained for the relative importance
of turbulent inertial forces compared with gravitational forces, FF,
For conditions in which this ratio was greater than ~1.,5, the variation
in the observed mass-transfer coefficients with Reynolds numbers was
linear on log-log coordinates with identical behavior for horizontal
and vertical flows. Below F,/F, = 1.5, the horizontal coefficient vari-
ation continued to be "linear" until the ratio of liquid axial velocity
to bubble terminal velocity, V/V, decreased to about 3, where severe
stratification made operation impractical. The vertical flow coeffi-
cients underwent a transition from the "linear" variation and approached
constant asymptotes characteristic of bubbles rising through a quiescent
liquid. The variable ratio of F/F, proved to be a useful linear scaling
factor for describing the vertical flow coefficients in this transition
region for which Equation (22) is the recommended correlation.

The Schmidt number exponent for the straight-line portions of the
data was observed to be greater than 1/2 based on physical property
data for 8 which may be suspect. Fitting the data with a Schmidt number

9h
PB
exponent of 1/2 resulted in only slightly less precision than for
the case in which the actual regression exponent was used, and a
definitive choice could not be made between the two, Based on theo-
retical expectations, a Schmidt number exponent of 1/2 would seem to
be appropriate, and consequently, the recommended correlation is
Equation (23).

The variation in mass-transfer coefficient with bubble mean diameter
over the range covered was observed to be linear in agreement with the
findings of Calderbank and Moo-Young'® for agitated vessels. Some pre-
liminary runs made with bubble mean diameters outside the range of this
report indicated that the linear variation does not continue but that
the coefficients level off at both smaller and larger diameters.
Furthermore the coefficients tentatively appear to decrease slowly with
increasing mean diameters above about 0.08 inches.

Consistent with findings of other investigations, the Reynolds
number exponent was significantly greater than expected based on agitated
vessel data compared on an equivalent power dissipation basis. One
explanation is that there may exist greater gravitational influence in
agitated vessels. Another is the postulated existence of different
bubble relative flow regimes,

A seemingly anomalous behavior was observed for the Reynolds number
variation in that the data for water (plus about 200 ppm N-butyl alcohol)
exhibited significantly smaller Reynolds number exponents and a corres-
pondingly smaller exponent for the ratio, (d/D), than that for the
glycerine-water mixtures. There may have been a difference in the

interfacial conditions (the addition of the surfactant creates a "rigid"
96
interface while the glycerine-water mixtures apparently generally had
"mobile" interfacial behavior). However, under steady relative flow
conditions this would result in no difference in the Reynolds number
exponent. Consequently, it was postulated that this difference resulted
from the possible existence of different bubble relative flow regimes.

In support of the above contention, a two-regime "turbulence
interaction" model was formulated by balancing turbulent inertial forces
with drag forces that depend on the bubble relative flow Reynolds num-
ber. The resulting mean bubble velocities were substituted into
"Frossling" equations to determine the mass-transfer behavior. The
resulting Reynolds number exponent for one regime (Rey < 2) agreed very
well with the experimental value for the glycerine-water mixtures and
that for the other regime (Re, > 2) compared favorably with the water
data and with agitated vessel data on an equivalent power dissipation
basis.

The dependence of Sherwood number on the bubble-to-conduit diameter
ratio, a/v, predicted by the interaction model did not agree with the
observed linear variation, Calderbank and Moo-Young'® pointed out that
the linear variation they observed in agitated vessels for bubbles of
this size range probably resulted from a transition from "small" bubble
to "large" bubble behavior. Such a transition could also explain the
present observations, however, there was no satisfactory means for vali-
dating this.

For comparison, a second analytical model was developed based on
surface renewal concepts which could also include different flow regimes.

This model incorporated an eddy diffusivity that varied with Reynolds
97
number, Schmidt number, bubble diameter, interfacial condition, and
position away from the interface. The variation of eddy diffusivity was
established by using a pseudo-turbulent model in which the turbulence
was simulated by superposed viscous eddy-cells damped by the bubble
interface in a manner determined by Lamont,!?

The surface renewal model assumed that the "renewal" period for the
bubbles was related to the bubble "mean" velocity resulting from a
balance between turbulent inertial forces and viscous resisting forces,
thus allowing the casting of the equations into nondimensional form with
the pipe Reynolds number, the Schmidt number, and a/D as parameters. A
closed solution of the equations was not obtained but a tentative numer-
ical solution employing a digital computer indicated that, in the limit
of small dimensionless renewal period, T, — interpreted as representing
mobile interfacial behavior, the classical penetration solution of this
particular form of the diffusion equation resulted.

As T, approached a value of approximately 2,7 (in this case), the
computer solution was independent of. (4/D) and resulted in a Schmidt
number exponent of ~1/3. Therefore, this value of T, was interpreted
as representing rigid interfacial behavior.

Explicit results based ‘on the models described above along with a
listing of the more significant observations of this study are given
below:

1. Bubbles generated in a turbulent field are well characterized
by the distribution function

where

2, The average volume fractions occupied by gas in bubbly flow
are approximated by Hughmark's correlation®“ only at higher flows. In
horizontal flow, when the ratio of axial velocity of the liquid to the
bubble terminal velocity is below ~25, Hughmark's correlation predicts
volume fractions lower than those observed, In vertical flow, while
the volume fractions are higher in downcomer legs then in riser legs,
they can be established by using Hughmark's correlation for the mean
and accounting for the buoyant relative velocity of the bubbles in each
leg.

3. At low turbulent flows stratification of the bubbles in hori-
zontal conduits prevented operation for ratios of axial velocity to
bubble terminal velocity below ~3.

4, Even at Reynolds numbers well into the turbulent regime, hori-
zontal and vertical flow mass-transfer coefficients differ. The Reynolds
numbers above which they become equivalent are marked by the dominance
of turbulent inertial forces over gravitational forces.

5. As Reynolds numbers are reduced, vertical flow mass-transfer
coefficients approach asymptotes characteristic of bubbles rising through
a quiescent liquid, The ratio of turbulent inertial forces to gravita-
tional forces serves as a useful linear scaling factor for estimating
the mass-transfer coefficients at these lower Reynolds numbers,

6. The effect of Reynolds number on Sherwood number for flow in
conduits is not as would be expected based on comparison with agitated
vessel data on an equivalent power dissipation basis, For example, the
observed turbulence-dominated data are correlated by

Sh/scl 2 = 0.34 Re®+2% (4/D)*° (23)

Moo-Young' © for small bubbles

In this thesis the two-regime turbulence interaction model and the
surface renewal model exhibit identical results for mobile interfaces
in the "Stokes" regime (Rey <2),
Sh ~ ScV/ 2 Re®*®2 (4/D)V 3
which compares well with the observations represented by Equation (23).

In the second regime (Re, > 2), the turbulence interaction model

for rigid interfaces results in
Sh ~ gel/ 3 pel-68 (a/p)=° 4.2
and the rigid interface interpretation of the surface renewal model
gives
Sh ~ Scl/ 3 Re0-85
as compared, for example, with Equations (2) and (3).

7. The observed linear variation of Sherwood number with bubble
diameter was not predicted theoretically. Consequently, following
Calderbank and Moo-Young,* © it is conjectured that this variation re-
sults from a transition from rigid (small bubbles) to mobile (large
bubbles) interfacial behsvior for this size range.

8. Data of this study that were obviously gravitationally influ-
enced compare favorably with data for particulates in agitated vessels,
giving rise to the speculation that gravitational forces may be more
influential in agitated vessels where there may exist a greater degree

of anisotropy compared with flow in conduits.
CHAPTER VII
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY

Experimental

Time did not permit a complete investigation of the effects of all
the independent variables. Consequently, projections of this study into
the future include experiments involving variations of the conduit diam-
eter and the interfacial condition. It is anticipated that these studies
will help clarify the role of a/p, in particular with regard to the
observed linear variation of mass-transfer coefficient with bubble diam-
eter. These projected studies will also attempt to extend the ranges of
variables covered through improvements in the bubble generating and
separating equipment. It is hoped that these improvements will reduce
the magnitude of the "end-effect" and thereby provide greater precision
to the data, Parenthetically, the high rates of mass transfer observed
in the bubble separator may qualify it for further investigation as a
possible efficient in-line gas-liquid contactor.

For practical purposes it is recommended that mass-transfer rates
also be measured in regions of flow discontinuities such as elbows, tees,
valves, venturis, and abrupt pipe size changes. An objective of these
"discontinuity" studies would be to test Calderbank and Moo-Young's
hypothesis that mass-transfer rates can be universally correlated with
the power dissipation rates.

As a direct extension of the work of this thesis, others might con-
sider use of different fluids to provide a more definitive variation of

the Schmidt number and of the interfacial condition, The studies could

100
101
have the additional objective of demonstrating that surface tension is
not an influential variable other than for its effect on the mobility
of the interface. Experiments designed to look at the actual small-
scale movements of bubbles in cocurrent turbulent flow and the eddy
structure very close to the interface would help guide further theoret-
ical descriptions and may help validate the dimensionally determined
expression for the average turbulent inertial forces.

One contention of the present work, the possible existence of
different flow regimes yielding different Reynolds number exponents,
should be further tested. A substantially widened range of Reynolds
number for a given bubble size in a viscous fluid might uncover a tran-
sition from one regime to another,

In practical applications, the interfacial area available for mass
transfer is equally as important as the mass-transfer coefficient.
Therefore, for systems in which relatively long term recirculation of
the bubbles is anticipated, the bubble dynamic behavior becomes of
interest. For example, more information is needed on bubble breakup
and coalescence which tend to establish an equilibrium bubble size in
a turbulent field. More important perhaps, is the effect of bubbles
passing through regions with large changes in pressure (e.g., across a
pump) where they may go into solution and, as the pressure is again
reduced, renucleate and grow in size. The effects on mean bubble sizes
and the interfacial areas available under such conditions are not well
known and this particular aspect of bubble behavior could provide a

fruitful field for further research.
102

Theoretical

Two extreme viewpoints were taken in this report in which bubbles
were considered as being either essentially passive in a turbulent field
with the mass-transfer behavior being governed by the "sweeping" of the
surface with random eddies or, alternatively, as moving through the tur-
bulent liquid and establishing a boundary-layer type of behavior.

The "surface renewal" model developed in this report was only ten-
tatively evaluated. Further development of the model is anticipated and
additional solutions should demonstrate the technique by which surface

renewal concepts can be applied to cocurrent turbulent flow.

A complete mechanistic description of mass transfer between bubbles
and liquids in cocurrent turbulent flow would presumably include the
transient effects of a developing boundary layer as a bubble is acceler-
ated in first one direction and then the other by random inertial forces,
Superimposed on this would be the effects of the surrounding eddy struc-
ture and the characteristics of the eddy penetrations through the
developing boundary layer. Further efforts to theoretically describe
these simultaneous effects should be considered with possible solutions
on a digital computer.

The use of pseudo-turbulent fields (e.g., an eddy-cell structure)
to determine the transport rates and to establish such properties as an
eddy diffusivity should provide useful insights into the actual behavior
in real fluids and should help predict data trends. For example, the
multiple boundary layer structure established by Busse®! for the vector

field that maximizes momentum transport in a shear flow strongly resembles
103

an artificial eddy-cell structure. Starting with such a structure, one
could work "backwards" to calculate eddy viscosities (for example) as a

function of position away from a solid boundary.

DERIVATION OF EQUATIONS FOR CONCENTRATION CHANGES

ACROSS A GAS-LIQUID CONTACTOR

Consider the cocurrent flow of a gas and a liquid in a constant
area pipeline of cross section A, and length L. In a differential
element of length df, a dissolved constituent of concentration C in

the liquid is transferred into the gas as shown below,

A mass balance for the dissolved constituent gives

where C is the liquid phase average concentration, C, is the gas phase
concentration, and Cy is the concentration existing at the gas-liquid
interface,

Dividing Equation (B-2) by Equation (B-1) gives

Integrating Equation (B-3) and letting Cg = 0 when C = C, gives
c, = (q,/a,)(c; =T) . (3-1)

If the interfacial concentration is assumed to be at "equilibrium"

and the solubility of the dissolved constituent is expressible by Henry's

Equation (B-6) can be substituted into Equation (B-1) to obtain

APPENDIX E

EVALUATION OF EFFECT OF OXYGEN SENSOR RESPONSE SPEED

ON THE MEASURED TRANSIENT RESPONSE OF THE SYSTEM

Instrument responses are typically exponential in nature. Thus,
if the sensor reading is defined as Cos and the actual loop concentra-
tion as C (both functions of time) it is safe to assume an instrument
response equation of the form

dC
r

=k. C-c)) , (E-1)
where K. is an instrument response coefficient.
The transient response of the loop itself is given by an equation
of the form
Xt

C=Ce 1 .
Oo

Therefore, Equation (E-1) can be expressed as

or +K_C_=K ceF1’ i (E-2)
Integration of Equation (E-2) with the initial condition c.=2C, at
t = 0 gives
c/c, = [1 - K,/(K, -K)) Xt, &,/(K, - Kp) eX t
= ae et pet (E-3)

The manufacturers stated response time for the Magna oxygen sensors
is 0% in 30 seconds, This response results in a value of

K = 4.61 .
r

The maximum observed rate of change of oxygen concentration in the
transient experiments corresponded to

129
130

K, = 0.775
(On the average, the experiment transients resulted in Kp < 0.3.) There-
fore, for this case, A = -0.19, B = 1,19 and

c./c, = 1.19e7°+78% — 0, 19e74+81t | (E-4)

An examination of Equation (E-4) shows that as time progresses the
second term becomes negligible compared to the first, and the measured
slope approaches the actual transient slope of 0.75. For example, the
measured slope for this "worse" case is 0.74 after only one minute of
transient compared to the real value of 0.75. Therefore, to further
minimize this possible error, the slopes of the measured transients were
taken only from the final six minutes of the curve permitting an initial
"response adjustment" time of several minutes. The error due to the

instrument response, then, is assumed to be negligible.
APPENDIX F
MASS BALANCES FOR THE SURFACE RENEWAL MODEL

Consider a differential region in a spherical shell of fluid

surrounding a bubble as shown below,

 

Mass balances for the concentration, C, of a dissolved constituent
within the liquid are obtained as follows:

time average of Equation (F-5) gives

APPENDIX G
ESTIMATE OF ERROR DUE TO END-EFFECT ADJUSTMENTS

The measured ratios of exit-to-inlet concentration, K, across a
gas-liquid contacter were extracted from the measured slope, S, of the

log-concentration versus time data by the relation

SV _/Q
K = e sg’ 4

The error involved in measuring the various quantities used to establish

K are estimated to be

and

HQ
2%. 0.03 .
QU

Consequently, the error in K can be estimated from

X LI ~ Kin
KX K ?
where
(8 =MS)(V. — av)
K = Exp -—m TE
max Q + ey )
and

=~
Il

min

13k
135
The minimum ratio measured for K was ~0.9, therefore the maximum estimate

of the error is

©.979¢ 99) .0D) (1.03)
AK 0.9 NE) - 0.9 . Ty
K 0.9

 

In Chapter III, the ratio, Kz, applicable to the test section above

was calculated from
Ks = K/Kip J

where Ks was the measured ratio across the bubble generator, the test

section, and the bubble separator together, and Kiq was that across

just the bubble generator and bubble separator. Therefore, the maximum

instrument-precision induced error in Kg is estimated to be

 

 

Ka K2 mex = K2 min
Kz ~ Kz
1+ 0,02 1 -0,02
kf (322-22) «fe 3 20-02) ;
~~ K 7K < 10% .
TIT

In establishing Ki and Rig in separate tests, the inability to
exactly duplicate conditions results in an error greater than the above.
An estimate of the maximum magnitude of this error can be had by examin-
ing the data for the 75% water-25% glycerine mixture (Figure 13, page 63).
Before the end-effect adjustment, the calculated vertical and horizontal
flow mass-transfer coefficients for the 0.02-inch mean diameter bubbles
were essentially identical, However, after the adjustment they differed
by ~25%., It is felt that this difference mostly arises from the inabil-

ity to exactly recreate the vertical flow conditions as a result of

alterations made in the bubble generator between the original test and
136
the end-effect test. Consequently the horizontal flow data are consid-
ered the more "exact" although they should still reflect the ~10% error

estimated due to measurement precision.
