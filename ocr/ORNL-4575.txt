CORROSION IN POLYTHERMAL LOOP SYSTEMS
II. A SOLID-STATE DIFFUSION MECHANISM WITH AND
WITHOUT LIQUID FILM EFFECTS

R. B. Evans III J. W. Koger
J. H. DeVan

ABSTRACT

The corrosion resistance of alloys exposed to nonisothermal
circulating liquids is an important consideration in the design
of reactor systems that employ liquids as either coolants or
coolant-fuel combinations. Accordingly, several mathematical
descriptions have been developed to explain selective transport
of corrosion-labile constituents of nickel-base alloys. This
report is the second of a series to correlate results of corro-
sion behavior observed in polythermal loop systems. The present
report specializes to cases in which solid-state diffusion in the
alloy, as influenced by coolant characteristics and composition,
dominates the corrosion mechanism. Equations are derived for
both transient and steady-state cases. Since transients, which
are induced by liquid films, are negligible, analysis of steady-
state behavior is of greatest importance.-

Applicability of the derived equations is demonstrated by
comparison of predicted values with experimental results for two
distinctly different systems. The first involves hot-to-cold-
zone transfer of nickel in Inconel 600 pumped loops circulating
liquid sodium. Comparisons revealed that actual corrosion is
much higher than predicted by the equations; this suggests that
the true corrosion reaction overrides a slow solid-state diffu-

- sion process. The second system considered is transfer of

chromium in Hastelloy N loops with molten salt flow induced by

thermal convection. Three hypothetical examples are considered,

namely: (1) chromium corrosion at all points, transfer to salt
only; (2) hot-to-cold-zone chromium transfer; and finally

(3) cold-to-hot-zone chromium transfer. While complete data to
substantiate the results computed for the above cases are not
available, the success of early Cr tracer experiments
(example 1) suggests that the solid-state diffusion mechanism
does apply to certain molten-salt systems when the salt con-
stituents (and impurities) are subjected to stringent control.

INTRODUCTION

In a previous report?! (hereafter referred to as Report I) atten-
tion was given to interpretations of corrosion behavior in systems com-
posed of liquid sodium contained in the nickel-base alloy Inconel 600.
Specific interest focused on experimental pumped loops that gave definite
evidence that nickel and chromium moved from hot to cold regions of the
loops. Only nickel transfer was considered, because little was known

~ about the solubility of chromium in liquid sodium; furthermore, the major

component undergoing corrosion and transfer: was nickel. Solubility
information is of major importance because the manner in which solubility

increases with temperature governs the steady-state driving force for
mass transfer around the loop.
The major effort in Report I was to develop a simple system of

equations that might describe the mass transfer as observed experimentally.

The approach in Report I was to assume that the mass-transfer equations
would fall into the same patterns as those that describe heat transfer
from hot to cold zones under conditions of known external-temperature

profiles and rates of fluid flow around the loop. For heat flow, the

only resistances involved would be an overall coefficient that would com-

prise the thermal conductivity of the walls and a heat-transfer film.
An analogous situation was assumed for mass transfer with the exception
that the thermal conductivity term was replaced by a reaction-rate con-
stant that was presumed to be associated with a first-order dissolution
reaction.

Predictions of corrosion based on the heat-transfer analog showed
that transient mass transfer effects decayed after negligibly short
times (fractions of an hour). Steady-state corrosion rates calculated
from the film coefficient alone were much greater than measured values.
It was necessary to invoke the reaction-rate constant to increase the

resistances and lower the computed results in order to match experimen-

tal results. While this "matching" could be done for results of individ-

ual experiments, a consistent set of reaction constants for all results

that would lead to a general correlation could not be obtained. One of
the prime reasons for the failure of the mechanisms covered in Report I
is that the loop walls were not pure nickel. Rather, the walls were of
an alloy wherein solid-state diffusion effects influenced the overall
behavior. These effects were ignored in the equations of Report I.

The present report is devoted to another mathematical treatment of
an idealized mass-transfer process wherein corrosion rates depend
directly on the rate at which consituents of alloys diffuse into or out
of container walls, as influenced by the condition of wall surfaces
exposed to a high-temperature liquid. Specifically, consideration is
given to cases for which solid-state diffusion controls mass transfer

at all points in a polythermal loop system containing circulating

liquids. The container constituents of interest are nickel-base alloys.

We have also considered the contributions of liquid-film resistances
acting simultaneously with the solid-state mechanism to ascertain whether
or not a suitable combined mechanism (our ultimate goal) could be
attained. Unfortunately, this approach was unsuccessful.

Three rather important assumptions are made in our present deriva-
tions. First, effects of changes in wall dimensions can be neglected.
Second, the rate of diffusion is unaffected by composition changes in
the diffusion zone of the alloy; in other words, the diffusion coef-
ficient is not a function of concentration. Third, the circulating
liquid is pre-equilibrated with respect to the amount of dissolved com-
ponents so that the concentrations in the liquid do not vary appreciably
with position or time. This latter boundary condition is embodied in
both the "transient" and "quasi-steady-state" conditions that are
covered in this report.

‘It should be mentioned that, although many liquids have been studied
relative to reactor applications, the basic approach in assessing corro-
sion properties remains the same. One employs either thermal convection
loops or pumped systems to collect the data required. At the time of
this writing, sodium systems, which are of interest to the Liquid Metal

' Fast Breeder Reactor,?s3 are under intensive study. We should note a

treatment similar to that to be covered here was initially roughed out

‘in 1957 under the auspices of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion (ANP)

Project.* The Hauids of interest in this early effort were molten

fluoride salts.”

The objective of the work “leading to the present report has been
to carry out refinements of the early ANP treatments, and to generalize

the results to permit their application to many systems that might

operate within the solid-state mechanism under consideration. A short-

term and immediate objective is to determine whether a mechanism of this
type applies to the migration of nickel in the sodium-Inconel system in

high-velocity pumped loops.

One of the central conclusions of the present study is that the
solid-state mechanism clearly does not explain the observed corrosion
behavior of the sodium~Inconel 600 system. On the positive side, how-
ever, the analytical work that was done is immediately and directly
applicable to Hastelloy N-molten salt thermal convection loops, in which
this solid-state mechanism clearly does operate. Thus, the present work
includes two separate topics: one covering corrosion induced by liquid

metals, another covering corrosion induced by constituents in molten-

+ salt systems.

For ease of presentation, a rather unorthodox outline has been

adopted for this report. First, we discuss basic diffusion relationships,

variables, and the type of transients one might encounter. Then we turn
to a discussion of liquid mass-transfer films and their effects on the
corrosion rates. Next, we derive and present equations for the cumula-
tive corrosion at quasi-steady-state (i.e., when the transient effect
associated with liquid film resistance has diminished). The term "quasi"
appears because the predicted corrosion varies with the square root of
time. These make up the most important aspect of the report. However,
to emphasize the meaning of the analytical results, detailed "example
calculations" are given. Separate discussions are presented for the
liquid-metal application and three molten-salt applications. The final .
section is a summary of the more important features of the equations and

their applications.

FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS

It would be most convenient, from the authors’ standpoint, to
proceed directly to the task of setting up the diffusion relationships
that take liquid phase mass transfer into account, show this to be of
little importance, and proceed directly to the quasi-steady-state solu-

tion based on the diffusion relationships. This is the conventional

method of presentation, but one immediately encounters fractional-
approach variables introduced by the nature of the alloys and chemistry
of the liquids. Accordingly, we shall jump ahead of the film part of -
the problem and start by writing down some of the well-known expressions
for solid-state diffusion in order to introduce the ideas behind
fractional-approach variables and to enable recognition of integrated

forms that emerge when film resistances are encountered.

Basic Diffusion Relationships

The basic relationships required are the concentration-profile
equations that express the weight or mass. fraction x(w,t) of an alloy
constituent as a. function of position across the wall, Wy and time, t.
We. let w =r — r’, where r’ is the inner radius of the loop tubing.

The relationships derive from Fick's second law of diffusion, sometimes
called the Fourier equation, and apply to both hot and cold zones of
the system. These relationships are developed elsewhere.®:7 It is suf-
ficient here to point out just a few important. features of the equations
involving x(w,t). First, x(0,t) is assumed to be constant with time.®
Only linear diffusion along a single coordinate,’ Ww, shall be considered.

The direction of w is normal to the liquid exposed surface, A , where

Ww = 0. The container walls are infinitely thick relative to the effec-

tive depth of the profile; thus x(«,t) = x, , the bulk concentration of
the constituent, for all times.

8The Justification for this assumption will become evident as we

discuss the relationship between the concentration of an element at the

metal surface and its concentration in the corrosion medium.

The reader should not infer that use of w = r — r’ means that a
radial flow system is to be employed; we use w as a linear flow coordi-
nate, even though the container is a cylindrical tube, because most of
the alphabet has been reserved for other notation.

Two functions evolve from the solution of the Fourier equation;

these hold for the hot and cold zones, respectively:

0 x(0,t) — x(w,t)

N= erf(v), (1)
Ax x(0,t) - x,
x(w,t) — x 0
Pe = xt) — x, = erfe(v) ’ (2)
ax x(0,t) — x,
where
v = w/ (408) 1/2 . (3)

Consider now a hypothetical case (somewhat implausible for an actual
loop) in which given points in the hot and cold legs have the same v.
A rather important identity can be demonstrated by adding Egs. (1) and
(2), namely, (oy, + 0.) /ox = 1. This happens because the definitions
of the error functions take the form shown below:

v oo

_ 2 2 a2 7,
rv) + erfe(v) Le ar + Je a 1 (4)

jo

As v approaches zero, op [0x approaches unity, and as v approaches
infinity, op, [ox approaches zero. The reverse is true for 0 [x This

means that

x(w,») = x(0,t) -» x, x(,t) = x(w,0)

in the hot zone, and

x(w,») = x(0,t) , x(,t) = x(w,0) =» x,

in the cold zone.

The necessity of introducing variables like ¢ and parameters like
Ax should begin to emerge at this point. From a physical point of view,
the concentration of a constituent in the alloy can never be unity in a
"compatible" alloy-liquid system. The purity of the liquid should be
high while its ability to dissolve alloy constituents should be minimal.

Thus, values like x(w,») = 1 or O, and x(0,t) = O or 1, are seldom

encountered in practice. Yet, from a mathematical point of view, the

- solution must vanish at all boundaries except one. Stated in the

language of partial differential equations, the heat equation must be
homogeneous; the same is true for all but one of the boundary condi-
tions1%s11 unless an additional equation is involved. The nonhomogeneous
conditions usually concern an initial or particular surface condition.
For these reasons, fractional-approach variables are employed.

The problem at hand requires use of x(w,t) as prescribed for Fick's

. first law, the latter being evaluated at the surface to obtain an expres-

sion for the flux traversing w = O:

dx(0,t) 1/2
dy = De, S —, Ox (p/mt) . (5)
If we assign z as the directional flow coordinate of the circulating
liquid normal to w, then Ax at each point is a function of z and of tem-

perature, and Eq. (5) with x(0,t) = Xp, takes the form

Sy = Pa (1 = 5px.) (Dfn6)2/2 (6)

. The flux Im is positive for the hot zone and negative for the cold zone.
~ One of the basic assumptions stated in the Introduction, namely, that

the concentration of the circulating liquid remains fixed with time,
means that the ratio xy /x, varies with related time-temperature points
in a special way. This is the reason Eq. (5) has been cast into the
form of Eq. (6). Irrespective of this, Eq. (6) may be integrated with

respect to time without concern about the xp/x, relationship, since

x(0,t) and, therefore, xXp/%,, do not vary with time. One obtains:

Under the usual sign convention, a positive value of AM/A means
that the metal constituent diffuses into the alloy (cold zone); negative
values mean outward diffusion (hot zone). We shall reverse this conven-
tion, since we desire a balance of M with respect to the liquid. The
solution behavior of most acceptable systems is such that the liquid
gains material in the hot zone and loses material in the cold zone. In
other words, x, > Xn in the hot zone; x, < Xo in the cold zone; notice
that Eqs. (6) and (7) follow the adopted convention automatically. The
next mathematical operation involves integration along z, but this
requires some knowledge of the manner in which z varies with T and, of
greater importance, the manner in which T varies with x(0,t). The lat-
ter is a problem in chemistry to which we now turn.

- Values of x or Kn may be computed with the aid of information summa-

rized by Baes.l%
We have assumed that all points along z are exposed to the same
concentration of dissolved species of interest. Thus [Cr] = Xn adjusts

to compensate for temperature-induced changes in Kn. Furthermore,

balance points f(p) and f(p’) exist along z and have the property

In = 0. These points delineate the boundaries of the hot and cold zones.
Clearly, then [er], ~ x at f(p), and an equation equivalent to
Eq. (9a) can be written with Kn replaced by K when quasi-steady-state

conditions are attained. The ratio in Eq. (7) is
Xp/%, = K /K, : (11)

Units of the concentrations in this ratio cancel out; those of X,, which

is factored out to form the Puy product, should be weight fraction

because dy is a mass flux.

We shall now consider nickel migration in Inconel 600 loops con-

"taining liquid sodium. Although it is generally accepted that the

nickel reaction is a simple dissolution process, very few reliable data
exist on the solubility of nickel in sodium. About the best one can do

at this time is to write an equation of the form:

Ni(s) = Ni(d)

Eq. (12), cast in the form of Eq. (9), passes through a set of solubility
data reported by Singer.l’ It is clear that

Ky = Y/r% (13)

fraction X of nickel to be unity, since the solubility experiments were

conducted in a pure nickel pot.1® In this case, Y (the saturation value

in the pot experiments) is equivalent to the experimental XK,. Ina

loop, x = (my/m )Y/K. Thus once again the form of Eq. (11) holds true.

it is negative, material would tend to move from the cold to the hot

Although Eqs. (14) and (15) are classical expressions — in a thermo-
dynamic sense — for first-order reactions, they seldom appear in this
form in corrosion practice. Mass fluxes are most frequently used, and
the concentrations and equilibrium constants involve weight or mass
fractions. Furthermore, the constants usually have velocity units.
These conventions require the use of mass density terms. Therefore,
additional modifications of Eqs. (14) and (15) are clearly in order.

Mass Transfer Across Liquid Films

The accepted and usual approach for explanations of the mass-
transfer phenomenon is to invoke the close analogies that exist for
various modes of heat and mass transfer. In this case we are interested
in the mass-transfer analog of heat transfer as it occurs under Newton's
law of cooling. In terms of the concentrations in the liquid, one may

write,
Jy = bP =e, (20)
and if surface reactions are fast — k, = ky [Kp >h —

Jy = h(Y - ve, . (20a)

The interested reader is referred to discussions given by Bird et al.l”
Of particular importance is the analogous way in which h's for mass and
heat transfer are computed. 18 Many think of h as a representative of
a diffusion parameter because a binary diffusion coefficient (for
example, Ni(d) in sodium) appears in the correlations concerning h for

mass transfer.

Combined Reaction Rate-~Film Resistances’

In some instances, a complete description of surface effects may
require coupling of the effects of both chemical kinetics and liquid
film transport such that the associated resistances to flow act in
series. The relationships sought are not new.1® We repeat them here
to gain generality and completeness. We note that the coupled resis-
tance is a most important aspect of the following presentation regarding
corrosion in liquid-metal systems.

Since a large portion of the combined surface effects involve
liquid behavior, we shall develop a rate term that gives the wall-
related input to an increment of fluid passing a unit area of wall.
This term will be altered to conform to solid-state diffusion convention
by changing certain liquid concentrations to pseudo-wall concentrations.
Three reference concentrations, each referred to the liquid, are
involved. These are: Y, ©, and y. Consider a unit area in the hot
zone. The same J, Passes both the resistances associated with the
reaction-rate equation,

iy = (5% = 59, | (18)

and the film equation,

ay = BGP =e, (20)

Thus, one may solve for + using Eq. (20), substitute this result in
Eq. (18), and, using manipulations allowed by Eq. (19), obtain:

Jy = BY = ye, , (21)

Surface Effects Referred to the Alloy

The next point to consider is the application of Eq. (21) to solve
a solid-state diffusion problem. Equation (21) may be altered as
follows with Y = KR : | |

Jy = Ey (5 - v/¥p)ey (21a)

The superscript appears on the X as & reminder that this is a true
alloy concentration at the surface. We have also substituted subscript T
for subscript exp. (experimental) as a reminder that kexp = Kp varies
with temperature. A basic assumption stated in the Introduction permits
one to treat y as independent of temperature. If we are at a balance
point, Jy =0, =X, and K;, = Ks where subscript p denotes balance

point. Thus, y = K a and for all other points along z other than p we

‘may write

5y = By(m fm) (© = xp, (210)
where
= x fi (23)

Before writing down the final forms, one will recall that Eqs. (21)
through (21b) were set up in terms of positive flow into a salt volume.
This is opposite to the direction of flow into the metal, so the sign
of Eq. (21b) must be reversed. Then,

Eq. (18) would have involved only weight fractions and the ratio m my,

TRANSIENT SOLUTIONS

The Introduction stated that the loop operation was to be initiated
with the y corresponding to the quasi-steady state. Quasi-steady state
invokes two conditions: (1) that the bulk concentration of the liquid
and, hence, the concentration of surface elements, x(0,t), remain fixed
with time, and (2) that the effects of the liquid film resistance on
mass transfer remain fixed with time. From the results of Report I, we
conclude that the bulk concentration of the liquid will have a constant
value in some small fraction of an hour. We now wish to examine the
point in time that the second transient condition, XX — x* # £(t), will
be realized. To find the answer, we must solve a somewhat complicated
solid-state diffusion problem. |

Review of the Equations

A succinct statement of the problem is as follows: First, find a

solution, x(w,t), of the Fourier equation,

incorporating Eq. (24) and other appropriate boundary conditions; then

manipulate the results to produce an expression like Eq. (7).
Solutions for Eq. (26) with (24) have been given for the hot

zones? using classical techniques, and for the cold zone alone?! using

laplace transforms. We could start with these results; however, little
would be gained and complete familiarity would be lost if this approach
were followed. In fact, it is just about as easy to start from the
beginning, since the flux expressions turn out to be the same (with the
exception of different signs) for both zones. Attention may be
restricted to one zone, and we shall choose the cold zone. Boundary
conditions are x{w,0) = x, x(w,t) = xX, x(0,») = x*¥; finally, x(0,t)
must satisfy Eq. (24). let

To go back to sign conventions associated with the corrosion medium, we

merely reverse signs by redefining AX* to be

Equation (23) was used to write the last form.
Comparison of the first term of Eq. (27a) — including the new ver-

sion of Ax* — with the right side of Eq. (7) reveals that both forms

are equivalent. One may recall that Eq. (7) was developed on the basis
of negligible film or surface effects, whereby 0 x*. This actually
happens over a period of time, depending on the H value, because

Several somewhat fortuitous distinctions evolve when the results
are put forth as a ratio. The results come out in compact form as
1 minus a remainder; the remainder obviously fades out as time increases.
This clearly demonstrates that surface effects, relative to diffusive
effects, are important only in the initial phases of the loop operation.
An attractive feature of Eq. (28) is the cancellation of Ax*. This
means that specification of the balance point (manifest through K,) is
not required to prepare a plot showing the effects of h or H. The
reader will discover in later sections that determination of the balance
points is an involved procedure, even under quasi-steady-state conditions.
Furthermore, we have no idea as to where the balance points reside at
various times during the transient period. Thus, elimination of 5 con-
stitutes an important simplification at this point in the report. Whether
M is lost or gained by the alloy makes no difference when the ratio is

used. The plots of the ratio versus time are always positive.

Application to Sodium-Inconel 600 Systems

For demonstrative purposes, we have concocted an illustrative
example for the Inconel-sodium system showing rates and degrees of
approach to equilibrium, assuming that the only surface effects of impor-
tance are those associated with the liquid film. In other words, we
assume that k, » «; thus h - h. This is assumed because no information
exists as to the values of k, and k, for the system. In fact, the values
of Ko are not above question. Details of the computation of H are given
later. We have compared two values of H corresponding to typical maxi-
mum and minimum temperatures for experiments with Inconel 600 loops con-
taining sodium, namely, 1089°K (1500°F) and 922°K (1200°F).

The example is presented in Fig. 2. Note that the film coefficient,

- h, in this example was assumed to be the same at all surface points

around the loop, while D and Kn in H were assumed to vary according to
the local liquid (actually wall) temperatures. A comparison of these

curves clearly indicates that film coefficients are of greatest impor-

 

tance in the hot zone where solid-state diffusion rates are relatively

 

high. Nevertheless, transient effects associated with the liquid-film

Fig. 2. Predicted Transient Behavior in a Sodium-Inconel 600 Loop

resistance become diminishingly small after about 24 hr. Since oper-
ating times for pump loops currently range from 1000 hr to one year,

‘we may neglect such transient effects without significantly affecting

the calculation of the overall transfer of M from one zone to another.

TEMPERATURE PROFILES AND LOOP CONFIGURATIONS

Reference and Prototype Loops

Our ultimate goal is to develop steady-state solutions for a vari-
ety of loops heaving arbitrary temperature profiles along z. For reasons
of mathematical tractability, we assume that the temperature profile may
be approximated by several straight-line segments. The number of seg-
ments is of no importance in the final analysis. However, for conve-
nience the connected segments should be drawn such that the overall
profile will exhibit only one maximum and one minimum. A "typical"
pump~loop configuration and profile will be considered for practical
reasons; this will be called the reference loop. Next we shall consider
a very simple profile designed to possess a fair degree of equivalence
to the reference loop; this will be called the prototype loop. A simple
and symmetrical prototype is desirable to minimize the necessary mathe-
matical calisthenics, particularly with regard to the numerical examples.

The Reference Loop

Figure 3 shows a schematic disgram of the reference forced-convection
loops used in early liguid-metal corrosion tests. Each loop consisted of
a pump and cold trap with a heat exchanger between the cold and hot legs
(surge tank attached). The inner tube of the heat exchanger contained
the hot liquid while the cold liquid traveled through the ammulus. Thus
the cold liquid was contained between two walls each at a slightly dif-
ferent temperature. The cold trap was used to remove traces of oxide
impurities, mainly N20, from the sodium. Only a small portion of the
mein flow was diverted to the cold trap. The trap design along with this
low flow, coupled with return-line heaters, mitigated major temperature
perturbations in the main flow stream. Furthermore, the trap did not
materially affect the deposition of metal constituents in the cold leg.

The maximum and minimum loop temperatures were 816°C (1500°F) and
649°C (1200°F), respectively, with a flow rate of 2.5 gpm and a typical
operating time of 1000 hr. The temperature profile and dimensional
information for the experimental (reference) loop are given in Table 1.

Before operation, the loop was flushed with sodium at about 650°C
for several hours to remove surface oxides. The cold trap was not used
during this operation. For the actual run, fresh sodium was introduced.
After operation, sections of the loop were cut and analyzed by various
methods.

A Prototype Loop
Table 1 illustrates that the temperature profile and geometrical

characteristics of the reference loop are quite complicated, especially
if one wishes to apply a mathematical treatment of the diffusion process
using numerical examples. Work of this type requires a more simplified
configuration, which we shall call a prototype loop. (We employ the
designation "prototype" to suggest that future designs of forced-
convection loops incorporate less complicated flow paths and temperature
profiles.) As stressed in Report I, we again avoid the overworked word

"model," as this might suggest that calculations of the overall corrosion

rate, M(t), depend on the flow characteristics of the prototype.
Except for transients, which are handled in these reports, the solid-
state diffusion mechanism depends only on the wall temperature and the
concentration of dissolved alloy constituents. We care nothing about’
the flow itself or its direction.

Our purpose here is to propose a simplified configuration Vhereby
all the geometrical complexities engineered into early forced-convection
loops will be removed; yet the. features importent to the mechanism
under test will be retained. Actually, we are striving for & maximm
degree of equivalence between the reference and prototype loops. The
most logical prototype that is easily envisioned is the "tent-shaped"
profile over a constant-diameter loop used by Keyes.2® This "tent-
shaped" profile appears to display the utility desired, although it is
somewhat awkward when applied to other mechanisms, where perhaps a saw-
tooth profile might be most appropriate. The idea that a tent-shaped
profile composed of two straight-line segments cannot be experimentally
obtained has been dispelled by DeVan and Sessions.?” They used profiles
that were tent-shaped but showed some asymmetry.

In long-term pump loop experiments we shall eventually establish
that liquid-film contributions are not of great importance; thus, the
primary consideration is acquisition of a loop with an equivalent area.

In Table 1 we see that the total area exposed to liquid is 784 in.? or

5050 cm. Ir we assume a constant diameter of 0.70 in. all around the
loop, the total length will be 906 cm, which is not too far removed
from the actual value of 886 cn for the reference loop. The average
Reynolds number, (me) weighted according to the fractional areas
involved, is 5.06 Xx 10%. .

Thus, we inquire as to the (Np) for the prototype loop. Based on

QUASI-STEADY~STATE SOLUTION

Statement of the Problem and Objectives

We seek a relationship that will permit computation of the amount
of M migrating from the hot zone to the cold zone of the loop, assuming,

of course, that Eo is endothermic; if not we seek the transfer in

In

- the opposite direction. Diffusion out of and into the container wall

is expected to be slow, and, if the liquid is pretreated to eliminate
transients associated with buildup of M in the liquid, all that remains
is a transient induced by the mass transfer film resistance.

We have previously shown that film transients become negligible
after a day or less. It follows then that our steady-state conditions
mean that the M concentrations in the liquid and the positions of the
balance points separating the not and cold zones are both steady (do not
vary) with time. The term "quasi" steady state must be employed, how=-

ever, because the point rates are proportional to £*1/2 ana the gross
 

oy

Nn

33

transfer is proportional to £-1/2, Therefore, both the rates and their
time integrals vary with time. However, in view of the quasi-steady-
state features of the problem, the timé and position integrations may
be performed independently of one another. This constitutes a great
simplification of the tasks that lie shead.

Our starting point is Eq. (7) in which the time integration has
already been performed for single points along z. The next step is
integration along z. Since dA, = 2nr’ dz and Xp/%, = K /%, [Eq. (11)],
we may integrate Eq. (7) as

M(t) _ [on0, (: - % (2nr! 1) (2) he (7a)
Z,

The Xp and D are functions of temperature, and z’ is a dummy variable
of integration. A differential form of Eq. (7a) is

z= (G37) 4 ree (1 E) om m

where f = 2! JL. The integrand evaluated at several points around the
loop is plotted in Fig. 5. Notice that Fig. 5 refers to the prototype
loop, which is actually an ad hoc device for the present discussion.

One could stop here, insofar as the mathematics is concerned, and
integrate graphically as was done in the original work.32 The procedure
adopted at that time was to assume a balance point, prepare a plot of

the integrand as indicated in Fig. 5, and then ascertain the area under

-~the hot zone portion of the curve. The procedure was repeated for the
cold zone. Unfortunately it was necessary to iterate until the two.

areas balanced. Use. of plots ‘similar to those in Fig. 6 speeded the
work; but this approach required meny trials, and it was tedious and

- ‘boring to say the least.

The only major aitterence bebves the earlier and present problems

wes utilization of a sinusoidal temperature profile in the earlier work.

line segments represents the most realistic approximation to experimen-
tal cases. Of greater importance, straight-line profiles are the

easiest to integrate: in fact, the results using straight-line ‘segments
are exact in an analytical sense. No serious compromises, such as
straight-line approximation of exponential functions over extended ranges,
are required.

Our problem divides itself into two distinct parts: (1) find the

balance points and (2) compute the amount of material entering or leaving
either zone. Both parts depend on obtaining the position integral. Our

 
 

 

 

36

approach will be to carry out the manipulations using the prototype
loop; present computations for the prototype loop using numerical
examples, hopefully to clarify the overall procedure and nomenclature;

and finally, discuss extension to cases like the reference loop.

Solution in Terms of the Prototype Loop

Equation (7a) is our starting point for the integrations that will

produce a solution

_AIM(8)] _ fa ox" (xD, 2/2 (x _ 2) exp (=) az. (7e)

ol Tol/z 2 2RT

 

The reader will recall that the time integration was performed earlier.
A factor of 1/2 appears on the left side as the symmetry of the tent
profile permits consideration of only half the loop. Also we have
introduced the expression for the diffusion coefficient in the form of

(D)1/2 = (D,)2/2 exp (ayo) : | (30)

The equilibrium constant may be written similarly as either

Kp = kK ex" 1/51) (31)
or |
-1 _ -1
(Kp)™ = (Ko)™t exp By yfRT) (312)
Thus Eq. (7c) can be divided conveniently into two parts:
(s, - 28
alu(t)] = oo (22 )e dz’ - of exp “ee [- D soln az’ , (74)
2t1/2 2RT
where

C = 4x p x’ (xD) 1/2 (32)
 

37

and
¢'= CK /X, (33)

The next part of the problem is the key to the whole solution. It
concerns the relationship between T end z. In terms of °C (or °F) an

obvious relationship is

T(z) = T, + bz, °C, (34)

where z runs from 0 to 0.5; thus
b= 2(F — T,)/L = 2AT/L (34a)

This would be an ideal form if the exponential terms in Eq. (7c) were
not present. However, they are indeed present; also they demand values
of T expressed in °K. Consider an extension of the segments on the pro-
files in Fig. 5 whereby the distance § would be zero at absolute zero
(=273°C or 0°K). What will happen is not difficult to visualize if one
recalls the trivial relationship, AT(°K) = AT(°C), which means that &

is valid for both temperature scales. One immediately envisions the
possibilities of an extended coordinate & such that

¢ = (L/2aT)(273 + T°C) = b~1(273 + Tin * AT) ,

E=t +z, am, (35)
which in turn simply means that we have adopted the relationship

T=0bt, °K, (35a)

for the extension. From Eq. (35) dt = dz, and the new variable £ may
be introduced into Eg. (7c) with this and following definitions: Let

a= Ej/2bR oo Cs oo (36)

and

of = (5 -2E_ )/ 2bR . (36a)

 
 

38

Then the right side of Eq. (7d) becomes
£, | £,
c [ exp (core) ag’ —c / exp (= tr) ag’
E, ky

or, in abbreviated form,

cx, (oft) —c 6 t) .

We are now ready for integration. Whether one operates on the

unprimed or primed term is of no consequence &s long as & or a > 1.

Thus we choose the former. However, a change of variable is useful at

Notice, via Eqs. (352) and (36), that u = Ep/2RT in this case. Clearly
the integration does not involve position ~ only temperature. However,
L does enter the results through the factor a. The integral term was
broken up into two parts, each with infinite limits, to cast the results
into a form that brings forth the so-called exponentiel integrals of the
first order. These are tabulated in the literature.3® In our work,
values of the argument are large , and in this case the tabulations are

Thus far we have outlined a solution for all cases where the reac-
tions leading to mass transfer are exothermic, also cases where the
reaction is endothermic up to the point where E_ , = Ep/2. At this
point the second term in Eq. (7¢) is simply

¢'1,,(0) = ox, - t,) (38)

which states that the second term in Eq. (7c) or (7b) is a constant.
The probability of this happening is quite low in practice, so we shall
pass immediately to the cases where the solution reaction is endothermic

One may back calculate to find T and then successively z, f, bp, end
finally, u.. The AM may be evaluated by application of Eq. (7d) using

either the limits (1,p) over the cold zone or (p,2) over the hot zone.
Details concerning these manipulations appear in the next section.

Predicted Results for Sodium-Inconel 600 Systems

Two objectives are associated with this section of the report.
First, we hope to attach some physical reality to equations developed
in the previous section through presentation of numerical examples,
thereby demonstrating that the equations are easy to use in spite of
their formidable appearance. Second, we desire to predict corrosion
rates under our assumed condition that diffusion controls both in the
hot and cold zones and that a predictable balance point does exist, as
suggested by the microprobe data shown in Report I. To parallel the
procedures for the preceding derivations, we may specialize to the case
of the prototype for simplicity without too much loss in generality.

One may start by considering the first and third columns of
Table 3. The first computation required involves b. One finds, using
Eq. (34a):

pel = L/2AT - 906/2 X 167 = 2.71 em/°K .
Related equations give oo |

£, = (2.715 em/°K)(922°K) = 2503 em ,
and

g, = (2.715 em/°k)(1089°K) = 2956 cm .

Computation of u, and u, requires a knowledge of & and & . But ‘these,
in turn, require parameters associated with the curves of Fig. 6.

For and related computations, diffusion parameters for nickel,
in an alloy similar to Inconel 600, as reported by Monma et al.3?
appear adequate, namely: D, = 3.3 cm?/sec and Ej = 70.2 kcal/mole.
For o and related computations, estimates of parameters based on
solubility data for nickel in sodium as reported by Singer and Weeks?
were employed. Pertinent values here are K, = 6.7% X 107° weight frac-
tion and Eoin = 6.985 kcal/mole. Application of all these values &s
indicated in the footnotes of Table 3 produces the values shown. Thus,

various values of Ey could be converted to the corresponding u, values.
The latter allowed calculation of the exponential functions; they also
allowed acquisition of appropriate 1 - Buy) values with the aid of
enlarged versions of Fig. 7. In this regard, note that both a and o’
are positive; thus, functions related to the Ey (uy) values apply here.
The operations necessary to complete the first and third columns are
straightforward and require no additional comment.

The next and perhaps most important task is a computation of the
balance points (the points at which Jy = 0). Since the prototype is
under consideration, just one point is needed because symmetry permits
treatment of only half the loop. The criterion is to set AM(t) =0 in
Eq. (7d). Thus the appropriate sum of the integral terms must also be
zero when the integration is carried out over the entire loop. This
facet of the solution is discussed around Eg. (40), reference to which

clearly indicates the method of approach; namely, we seek T, oF £(p)

through KX. ‘The latter is given by:

K, = KoIy2(0t/8)/Iy2(0r JE) = (6.79 X 10™%)(1.46¢ — 0.0565) X 10=3/(4.509

—- 0.315) X 107% ~ (6.69 X 1073)(3.37 x 1072) = 2.28 x 10~¢ .

The temperature corresponding to K_ is 1036°K; thus ES ~ (2.715)(1036°)
= 2813, and £(p) (of L/2) is 0.683. Computation of the values in the
middle column corresponds to & ‘information.

Finally a value for AM(t) may be. found by use of integral terms for
the cold zone (limits: 1,p) and for the hot zone (limits: p,2). Values
for both zones were computed and averaged since all the differences
involved introduced some uncertainties in "hand calculations." Every-
thing required to calculate AM(t) appears in Table 3 except values of C
and. C’. The latter are evaluated through Eqs. (32) and (33). Thus

C = (4)(0.763,)(9.111)(0.350 x 2.54)(3.3 x 3.141,)}/2 = 70.9 ,
and

¢ = (3.37 x 10°2)('70.9) = 2.39 .

For the cold zone, using Eq. (7¢) again,

 
 

 

46

a(t) [2621/2 = (70.9)(5.83 ~ 0.569) x 1076 — (2.39)(2.12 — 0.315) x 107%
= (3.73 = 4.31) X 107% = =5.8 x 10% g/secl/? .
For the hot zone,
AM(t) [23/2 = (70.9) (14.66 — 5.83) x 1076 — (2.39) (4.509 — 2.12) x 10%
= (6.26 — 5.71) x 10% = 45.5 X 10~° g/secl/? .

The different signs mean that the liquid sodium loses nickel in the cold
zone, but it gains nickel (in principle, an equal amount) in the hot
zone. The test period of interest is 1000 hr, 2t1/2 = 3.8 x 103 secl/2;
therefore:

AM(t = 1000 hr) = (3.8 x 10*3)(5.65) = 0.215 g Ni .

A very high value of transport could be obtained by assuming that
no balance point would exist because all the liquid could be forced
through a 100%-efficient nickel trap placed at the coldest point of the
loop. In other words, the entire loop would be a hot zone. One obtains

f(t = 1000 hr) = (3.8 x 103)(70.9)(14.66 — 0.57) x 10-6

3.8 g Ni .

This value was computed for comparative discussion.

DISCUSSION OF SODIUM-INCONEL 600 RESULTS

The manner in which the material has been presented up to this
point almost demands that some comparisons be made between predicted
(computed) results for the prototype loop and those for the reference
loop. In this connection, we digress to note that extension of the
mathematics to actual loops with temperature profiles as indicated by
the solid line segments in Fig. 4 is relatively simple in principle,
but tedious in practice — because symmetry is lost and several straight-

line segments (each with its own b, a, and o' values) are present. Of

course, each must be accounted. Accordingly, a computer program“! was
developed to handle all cases where Ej =2E 1,

There were several reasons whereby use of a program could be
justified. As shown in our illustrative calculations, the balance
point is difficult to determine precisely by hand; we might add that
acquisition of predicted corrosion and deposition profiles is also
desired. The program permits an accurate prediction of these because
the computer can evaluate many "point" J's quite repidly after locating
the balance points [and evaluating AM(t) in passing].

The reader is invited to inspect Fig. 9, in which computer program
results for the actual loop and the prototype are presented together.
The 1000-hr AM(t)'s computed from the integral forms are 0.232 g for the
actual profile and 0.213 g for the prototype. Recall that the hand
calculations based on Table 3 gave a value of 0.215 g for the prototype.
The locations of the balance points for each case are also in close
agreement. Thus we may conclude that the prototype is an excellent
device for estimating AM, even though the profiles themselves turn out
to be somewhat different in appearance.

The point of greatest importance is whether or not the mechanism
under discussion here gives a reasonable representation of what happens
in an experimental loop. The answer to the question, as was the case
for Report I, is, "No, it does not!" The amount we must account for
ranges between 10 to 14 g Ni. The computations produce values consider-
ably less than 1 g Ni if one assumes that a balance point exists and
about 4 g if one assumes that the entire loop acts as a hot zone under’
the dominance of the mechanism proposed. In regard to the latter, micro-

probe data show that deposition occurs in at least half the loop.
Deposition tendencies are, in fact, so great that a region of nickel

deposits appears, and furthermore samples of loop sodium suggest that
the- liquid is either supersaturated or contains suspended metal particu-
lates all around the circuit. Thus we can forget about the value of

4 g and base our conclusions on a predicted value ranging about 0.242 g.
Other shortcomings of the mechanism described here stem from the initial
assumptions that AM is not a function of fluid velocity — only of wall
temperature — and that AM should be directly proportional to the square
root of time. Both assumptions are in opposition to experimental behav-
ior as described in Report I.

At this point we must consider which of the two limiting cases
(treated individually in Report I and in the present report) might be

most responsive to alterations to form the basis for an empirical

correlation. In other words, if we were to concoct a combined mechanism
accounting solid-state and liquid~-film diffusion effects together, where
should we start? Intuitively, we lean toward the idea of going to work
on the liquid-film mechanism, simply because it is the faster of the two
considered thus far. We are attracted to this point of view because
resistances associated with a fast mechanism can always be reduced by
addition of a time-variable resistance that acts in series with the
liquid film. On the other hand, it would be most difficult to Justify
decreasing the resistance of the slower mechanism. We should mention
here that inclusion of a film resistance in the usuel manner gives rise
to a transient effect, which decays with time. Although such an effect
is fortuitous, the overall result was to reduce further the already low
value of material transported.

Two possibilities for altering the diffusion mechanisms under dis-
cussion might seem feasible. The first would involve increasing the
value of Dns such that the predicted results and experimental data
would coincide. The factor of increase would have to be about 10%, but
this might be tempered by the use of higher solubility values. Never-
theless, increases of this magnitude do not appear reasonable, and one
tends to rule out this possibility.

A second possibility for increasing the predicted values would be
to invoke solid-state diffusion equations where the point at which w = O
moves around the loop. In other words, assume that the walls grow
slightly thicker in cold regions and slightly thinner in the hot zones.

This would accrue from corrosion reactions that will not "wait for" a

diffusion-controlled process. However, the solution x(w,t), even for
the case where the w = O boundary moves at a constant rate (a simple
case), “2 4g too complex to be effectively applied to a mathematical

treatment of the mass transfer process.

42p solution of this kind is given by E. G. Brush, Sodium Mass
Transfer; XVI. The Selective Corrosion Component of Steel Exposed to

Flowing Sodium, GEAP-4832 (March 1965), Appendix II, pp. 105-110. More

general forms of this solution appear on pp. 388-389 of H. S. Carslaw
and J. C. Jaeger, Conduction of Heat in Solids, 2nd ed., Oxford
University Press, New York, 1959, along with citations of the original
work (in 1955), which also involved diffusion in liquid metals.

For both possibilities, a large amount of experimental data would
be required to justify the selection of the approach and the evaluation
of the parameters required. It would seem that, on the basis of the
data available, the best approach is to resort to an empirical treatment.
This is the objective of the next report. We may now turn to an applica-

tion of the solid-state diffusion mechanisms to molten-salt systems, for

“which the corrosion reactions are well understood and the diffusion

mechanism appears to apply — as demonstrated in early experiments.
APPLICATION TO MOLTEN-SALT SYSTEMS

The results of experiments carried out over the past few years on
the temperature gradient migration of metal in a molten-salt environment
indicate that the overall rate of movement is controlled by diffusion
rates within the metal. Hence, we will apply the equations derived
earlier to several molten-salt systems to demonstrate the usefulness of
the method. |

At the beginning of the operation of a molten-salt loop that con-
tains UF, as reactant, chromium will be removed from the entire loop
until the CrF, concentration in the circulating salt reaches equilibrium

with the chromium concentration of the wall surface at the coldest

. position of the loop. At this time this position is the balance point.

Then, as the concentration of CrF, in the circulating salt increases
even more, this initial balance point develops into a growing deposition
area bounded by two balance points. Steady state is attained when the
balance points become stationary and the CrF, concentration in the cir-
culating salt ceases to vary with time. Our mathematical analysis is
valid for this last condition we call the quasi steady state. Quasi
steady state can also be obtained by pre-equilibrating the salt before
loop operation — that is, adding the amount of CrF, required so that

the concentration will be constant.

Thermal Convection Loops

is shown in Fig. 10. The thermal convection loop differs from the pump
loops mentioned in the earlier sections in that flow is achieved by.
convection forces resulting from heating one leg and an adjacent side
of the loop while exposing the other portions of the loop to ambient
conditions. The flow velocities in the thermal convection loop are 2 .
to 10 fpm, depending on the temperature difference and dimensions of
the vertical sections. The total tubing length of the loop under dis-
cussion is 254.0 cm and the diameter is 1.383 cm.

The maximum temperature of the two actual (reference) thermal con-
vection loops in which our calculations are based was 860°C (1580°F)
and the minimum 685°C (1265°F). Both loops were constructed of
Hastelloy N, whose nominal composition is given in Table 4. As noted
in an earlier section, the actual loop temperature profiles were not
conducive to a simple analytical expression, so we have proposed a
simplified configuration ("tent-shape" profile), which we designate the
prototype profile. Figure 11 shows the average temperature profile for
the two loops and the profile assumed for the prototype. ‘The prototype
profile was constructed by drawing straight lines from the minimum tem-
perature at £ = 0 and 1.0 to the maximum temperature at f£f = 0.5. This
construction provided the same maximum temperature for the actual and
prototype loop while allowing some small difference in the areas under
the curves.

The diffusion coefficient of chromium in Hastelloy N as a function
of temperature is given in Fig. 12. These values are based on determina-
tions437%4 of the self-diffusion of chromium in Hastelloy N using the
tracer °1Cr in thermal convection loops like those previously mentioned.’

In our examples we shall consider three different molten-salt
systems. Table 5 lists the significant reacting components of the salt
and also the alloy constituents sensitive to oxidation by the salt.

reactions. The three corrosion reactions have been designated as

In example I the salt was composed of NaF47 mole % ZrF, with
6720 ppm FeF,. The salt of example II is assumed to be primarily a
LiF-BeF,-UF, mixture typical of a fuel salt for a reactor with no impuri-
ties such as FeF, present. Example III involves the same basic salt as
example II but with HF present instead of uranium or iron fluorides.

In molten-salt mixtures HF can be formed by a reaction with water or

all fluoride salt mixtures at the start of loop operation. In regard to
the ZrF, present in the salts of examples IT and III, certain amounts of
ZrF,; were added to LiF-BeF, mixtures that contain UF, to prevent precip-
itation of UO, through inadvertent contamination of the system with

oxygen.

Transient Factors

Certain transient factors that are associated with surface condi-
tions, even with a quasi steady state, were discussed earlier for the

sodium-Inconel pump loop system. We will now perform calculations and

~ discuss these transient factors for the molten-salt systems.

The conditions under which the calculations, both transient and
quasi-steady-state case, were made for example I were realized experi-
mentally in an actual thermal convection loop, designated as loop 1249.
In this loop an excess of FeF, was added to the salt so that the entire
loop acted as a hot zone. No balance point existed, since chromium was
removed from the alloy at all positions. |

mass transfer equation can be written and h can be calculated. Its
value is sufficiently close to the h calculated with the equation for
turbulent flow so that the former h will be used in subsequent

and the velocity of the salt is 1.422 cm/sec from loop operating data.
We calculated H to develop a curve such as Fig. 2 for the molten salts.
However, it became quite evident that, because of the high value of H
for each example, the transient effect would be even less than that
seen for the liquid metals. Thus, we again show that the transient
effects may be neglected and that only the quasi-steady-state solution
need be considered. oo

Quasi-Steady-State Solutions

Agein, as in the liquid metal case, we are required to find the
balance points (in examples II and III) and the amount of material
entering or leaving the hot and cold zones. The calculations will be
made for the actual end prototype loops using the equations derived
earlier. The variables affecting the results of these calculations will
then be discussed. We will present computer calculations for two of
the examples and will show the details of a "hand" calculation for
example II to demonstrate the usefulness of the equations.

As already noted, the conditions under which the calculations were
made for example I represent actual conditions encountered in loop 1249,
namely, an excess of FeF, was added to the salt so that the entire loop
acted as a hot zone. No balance point existed, and chromium was depleted
from all surfaces. Figure 13 shows the positional dependence of mass
transfer rates in the reference and prototype loops as determined by
. computer calculations. The total mass removed in 1000 hr is 0.595 g in
the reference loop, compared with 0.6122 g in the prototype.

In example II, balance points exist, and, as in the liquid metal
section, we have tabulated the values of the various variables and will
demonstrate the arithmetic involved for the prototype loop. The obvious
difference between this molten-salt calculation and the liquid metal
calculation is the fact that Egor > Ep/2. This necessitates the use
of the Eqs. (39), (39a), and (39b). We did not compile a computer
program to handle the Eoin > E [2 case, so we have used the approach

For these next calculations, we use the values for the diffusion

We next calculate the balance point, where In = 0 or, more simply,
where material is neither removed nor deposited. Since we have delib-
erately constructed a symmetrical prototype loop, only one point need
be calculated. The approach for the calculation of the balance point
was discussed earlier, and in this case a form of Eq. (40) was used;

namely,
= KI, (a/8)/T,, (an/E) = 1.047 X 102(7.445 x 1072
- 1.015 x 10-2) /(1. 360 x 107 — 0. 303 x 107) = 6. 268 x 10-7

The temperature corresponding to is 1041°K; thus to = 755 and
f(p) = 0.233. The values corresponding to the ‘balance Pott tempera-
ture are given in column 2 of Table 6. oC

To calculate the total amount of material transported, M(t), we
use integral terms for the hot and cold zones. Again we averaged the
values for both zones because of uncertainties in the "hand calcula-
tions." n Table 6 lists all quantities needed except values of C and C’.
Using Eqs. (32) and (33) we find

The negative sign indicates that the salt loses chromium in the cold
zone (by deposition on metal) and gains in chromium in the hot zone
(by metal dissolution). After 1000 hr 2t1/2 = 3.80 x 10*3 gecl/?, so

AM(t=1000 hr) = 3.80 x 10%3(6.96 x 107%) = 0.264 g Cr .

DISCUSSION OF MOLTEN-SALT RESULTS

In the past, the mass transfer equation was integrated graphically,

and areas under the curves were determined by planimeters.

However, by

introducing the prototype loop, we can perform a relatively simple

exact integration of all the equations as detailed in an earlier sec-

tion.

A computer was used to generate several of the mass transfer

curves, since this allows integration over many smaller segments than is

otherwise practical.

‘Table 7 gives the total amount of chromium removed in 1000 hr for

each reaction.

For examples II and III, where balance points exist,

AM(t = 1000 hr) also corresponds to the amount of material deposited.

Also included is the AM value for example I with balance points and no

excess Fels.

This calculation is given as an example of what could hap-

pen in a coolant circuit where FeFz; is the only impurity that would

cause corrosion.

The balance points would result when only a. small

amount of FeF, is present; weight losses would result at higher temper-

atures and weight gains at lower temperatures in the system. Areas

® Assuming a balance point with oH = +10, 370 cal/mole and
K, = 1.0 x 10710,

under the plots of AM against distance were also determined with a
planimeter, and the results are given in Table 7.

It is first noted that graphical and numerical integration gave
values quite close to one another. This is gratifying because in the
past much dependence ‘had been placed on graphical integration methods,
and now we see that the numerical calculations agree quite well.
Although the agreement is not quite as good as in the liquid metal
case, again the AM's are about the same for the actual and prototype
profiles, so that good estimates of AM may be made using the simple
prototype. The disagreement is proportional to the difference in the
areas under the temperature profile curves. Also, it makes no differ-
ence in the final result whether the profile is like that of the proto-
type or is a sawtooth. In Fig. 15 (example II), the balance points
were f(p) ='0.34 and 0.90 and I, = 1036°K for the actual loop and

 
 

 

 

66

f(p) = 0.23 and 0.77 and I, = 1042°K for the prototype. In Fig. 16
(example III), the balance points were f(p) = 0.43 and 0.71 and

Tp = 1083°K for the actual loop and f(p) = 0.36 and 0.64 and I, = 1083°K
for the prototype. Again, although the shapes of the profile obviously
affect the location of the balance points, the balance points and
balance temperatures are quite close in all cases. We also point out
that although maximums of weight loss and gain do occur at the maximum
temperature point in examples II and III, other maximums (gain or loss)
may occur at positions other than that of the minimum temperature.

This is illustrated in Fig. 16, where the maximum weight loss occurred
at the intermediate value of 1030°K. The worst possible condition with
respect to the total amount of material removed was illustrated in
example I, where corrosion occurred on all portions of the loop. A ten-
fold difference in the value of AM corresponding to material removal
and deposition obtained in the same reaction without excess FeF; is
shown in Table 7 for both the prototype and actual loops.

Several "rules" for mass transfer follow from these results. The
common areas among the three examples are temperature, flow conditions,
and selective chromium removal from the Hastelloy N. Since dissolution
is endothermic for examples I and II, the mass transfer is from higher
to lower temperatures. More material is removed and deposited in
example II, which has the largest energy of solution. In example III,
where dissolution is exothermic, the mass transfer occurs from low to
high temperature. Because temperature enters the mass-transfer funec-
tion as an exponential term, an increase in the maximum temperature
greatly increases AM. For example, an increase of 50°K would about
double the AM.

Table 8 shows the constants A and B used to calculate equilibrium
constants from log K; = A + B(103/T); also shown is the sign of the
energy function for various reduction-oxidation reactions in LiF~-BeF;-
base fluoride salts. Example I calculations discussed earlier were for
an NaF-ZrF; salt. From the values given in the table, we will discuss
the mass-transfer aspects of the various reactions.

requirements that must be met for mass transfer in the direction of

decreasing temperature is a positive energy of solution. In this
respect, the reactions of the alloy constituents with UF, and BeF, and
the reduction of UF, and BeF, by hydrogen meet this criterion. It is
noted that in all these cases, with the exception of the oxidation of
chromium by UF,, the calculated value of K is quite small, so these

reactions would be unfavorable and the yields would be quite small. In

reference to mass transfer in the opposite direction, as favored by the
other reactions, most of the equilibrium constants are quite large. The
relative ease of chromium movement, followed by iron and then nickel, is
pointed out by the relative values of the equilibrium constants. For
example, for reactions with UFs, Kygqs0p = 1076, 10710, ang 10°15, respec-
tively. Reactions of molybdenum are not included because equilibrium

 
 

68

constants are not available. However, because the free energies of
formation of molybdenum and nickel fluorides are nearly equal, we would
expect the equilibrium constants to be about the same.

With respect to the UF; corrosion reaction, methods are now being
considered to measure the U(III)/U(IV) ratio and thus determine the
oxidizing or reducing potential of the UF4-containing molten salt.
Additions of beryllium are being used to adjust this potential and con-
trol the corrosion rate. Investigations are also under way for the
possible application of ?5Nb deposition as the redox indicator.*®

We also wish to consider if loop conditions are actually the same

as those under which the equilibrium quotients were determined. Actually

we beg the question: can mass transfer occur in a loop in the direction
of low to high temperature as is theoretically shown from the FeF, and
HF reactions with balance points in LiF-BeF, salts? Recent experimental
work*? in salt systems containing UF,, FeF,, and HF show evidence of
mass transfer only from high to low temperature. However, nothing is
known about the effects of the combinations of the reactants or what
effect removal of elements other than chromium from the alloy might have
on. the overall process. It would be interesting to speculate what ratio
of CrFy, to FeF, would be needed in a UF;-containing salt to stop the

mass-transfer (and the corrosion) process altogether. A promising future

goal would be to carefully isolate the above components and to run the
verifying experimental tests in loops.

In salts proposed for use in a breeder reactor system, ThF, is
includad. The ThF; will not oxidize chromium, so its presence will not
affect the corrosion process.

It must be again emphasized that there is a parallel betwesn the
results in Report I and here. The mass-transfer equations of Report I
were derived as analogs of heat flow equations. Rate equations of this

type consist of driving forces and resistances. The resistances in

Report I were based on the first-order reaction rate constant and the

film coefficient. The driving forces are differences that are involved
in both mechanisms. For example, when solution rate is controlling,
the important difference is that between the equilibrium corrosion
product solute concentrations at the high and low temperatures of the
system, while, when diffusion controls, the difference is that between
the bulk alloy concentration and the surface alloy concentration of the
active alloying element. The results do not depend on the shape of the
profile in the mechanism of Report I and only sometimes in the mechanism
given here. The corrosion product concentration differed with tempera-
ture (position) in Report I, while here we assume constant concentration
of the corrosion product throughout the loop. This is quite important,
because the use of the equilibrium constant allows us to change only one
variable with temperature. ‘This was not possible in Report I.

As we mentioned earlier, liquid velocities in pump loops are
orders of magnitude greater than those in thermal convection loops.
Throughout this report we have assumed that conclusions about pump loop
corrosion behavior are good for thermal convection loops and vice versa.
of course, if the process is truly controlled by solid-state diffusion
in the alloy, then velocity will not affect the mass transfer.

SUMMARY

We have elected to summarize the molten-salt results since we wish
to illustrate several cogent points. In this portion of the report our
main purpose was to discuss the molten-salt corrosion (mass transfer of
chromium) of Hastelloy N in polythermal loops for cases where solid-
state diffusion controls throughout the system. We have demonstrated
the versatility of the method by showing three different examples:
removal of chromium from all portions of the loop, hot-to-cold leg

transfer, and cold-to-hot leg transfer.

Calculations for both transient and quasi-steady-state conditions
were based on a mathematical development of the idealized diffusion |
process, wherein corrosion rates depend directly on the rate at which
constituents of alloys diffuse into, or out of, container walls as influ-

enced by the condition of wall surfaces exposed to a high-temperature

 
 

 

70

liquid. The transient effects (the effects of mass transfer across the
liquid films on corrosion) were negligible because of their short dura-
tion. The quasi-steady-state condition assumed a pre-equilibration of
the salt with CrF, such that the concentration of CrF, did not change.

The balance points and the amount of material entering or leaving
the various zones of the: loops for the various systems were determined
for the quasi steady state. The calculation was adaptable for both the
prototype "tent-shaped" and actual loop temperature profiles. The
results obtained from the prototype, which were quite simple to calcu-
late, agreed very well with the results from the actual profile. Impor-
tant variables discussed in this treatment with respect to the mass
transfer process were the energy of solution of the corrosion reaction,
the energy of activation for diffusion, the equilibrium constant of the
corrosion reaction, and its temperature dependence.

In conclusion, the practical importance of the calculations lies
in the fact that, if the proper experimental data are available, one
may determine, before running a loop test, the magnitude and manner in
which the mass transfer will occur. One may also predict the changes
expected in a completed experiment if the temperature conditions are
varied with the developed equations. Of perhaps even greater importance
is the fact that a priori calculations of this type are required to
‘predict the concentration that will give a pre-equi libration condition
at the beginning of an experiment. This is necessary for one to run a

systematic well-developed test.
