SUMMARY

In connection with the search for container ma-
terials suitable for use in high-temperature molten
fluoride reactor systems, the corrosion of several
metals by various fused fluoride mixtures was
studied in thermal-convection loops made from the
metal being tested. In these tests the temperature
drop was fairly large, but the velocity of the liquid
The fluoride
mixture used in most of the study contained 43.5
mole % KF, 10.9 mole % NaF, 44.5 mole % LiF,
and 1.1 mole % UF, and is referred to as "fluoride
14." In a series of screening tests Inconel, or
similar high-nickel alloys, was shown to be the
most promising container material.

It is called to the reader's attention that the data
reported are from loops that were operated for only
relatively short times, 500 hr, and with impure
fluoride mixtures. More recent data are reported
elsewhere.’ The lack of purity of the mixtures
was an important consideration in the tests re-
ported; however, the purification processes have
since been perfected by the Materials Chemistry
Division.
transfer is of more importance than it was con-
sidered to be at the time of the reported tests and
also that the rate of mass transfer varies greatly
for different fluoride batches.

With fluoride 14 an average figure for the maxi-
mum microscopically visible attack on Inconel was
0.012 to 0.015 in. after 500 hr of circulation. The
attack was in the form of small voids which did not
connect with the surface or with each other. It is
shown that for the times used here the attack was
caused primarily by the reduction of fuel impurities
by chromium metal from the container and by the
leaching of sufficient chromium to reach equilibrium
concentrations in reactions with the fluorides,
primarily with UF. In contrast to the effects of
impurities, the depth and type of attack varied only
slightly when changes were made in the major com-
ponents of the various fluoride mixtures studied.

The only effect definitely established was that, in
every case, mixtures containing uranium fluoride
caused more attack than did similar mixtures con-
taining no uranium. When the loop was operated at
a fluid temperature of 1650°F, the attack was
slightly deeper than it was at 1300°F. The od-
dition of zirconium hydride to the fuel almost com-
pletely eliminated the attack. Alkali metals also
acted as inhibitors.

It was found that type 316 stainless steel might
be considered for a container for molten fluoride
mixtures that do not include potassium fluoride.
With such stainless steels and zirconium fluoride—
base mixtures, the maximum depth of attack was
about the same as that found with Inconel; how-
ever, more material was mass-transferred and cold-
leg deposits were found. When alkali-metal-base
mixtures were circulated in type 316 stainless
steel, plugging occurred in a relatively short time;
the plugging was probably caused by the formation
of a compound similar to K,NaCrF .

INTRODUCTION

A major problem connected with the development
of circulating-fluoride-fuel reactors for aircraft
propulsion at ORNL? has been that of corrosion,
since these reactors will involve high-temperature
operation and the use of corrosive liquids. There-
fore the Experimental Engineering Section of the
Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Division, the ANP
Reactor Chemistry Section of the Materials Chem-
istry Division, and the ANP Materials Section of
the Metallurgy Division were assigned the joint
task of finding a material that could be fabricated
into thin-walled tubes and that could be used in a
molten-fluoride reactor system in which the maxi
mum temperature of the fluid is 1500°F and the
temperature drop is 400°F. This interim report
deals with some of the metallurgical phases of the
problem,

The high temperature, considerable temperature
drop, and dynamic flow conditions under which the

power reactors will operate all have an effect on
corrosion and therefore had to be included in the
study. A dynamic test is the only type of cor-
rosion test that will incorporate these variables
and permit a study of mass transfer. When this
work was started, pump loops were not feasible,
since reliable high-temperature fluoride pumps and
seals had not then been developed. A loop em-
ploying thermal convection for the driving force
that had been developed by the General Electric
Company® and that had been modified by the Ex-
perimental Engineering Section of the ANP Di-
vision at ORNL for corrosion testing with sodium*
was simplified and adopted for the preliminary
stages of the investigation.

The thermal-convection loop could be operated
with a hot-zone temperature of 1500°F with a
reasonable temperature drop and was fairly simple
to fabricate. Its main disadvantages were the low
and fixed flow rates and the size of the system.
Standard loops comprise about 10 ft of pipe and
contain about 35 in.? of liquid, which made them
obviously unsuitable for conducting a large number
of screening tests. Thus the thermal loops were
used for an intermediate test. The preliminary
screening work was done with static and seesaw
tests, whereas the final testing would utilize
high-velocity pump loops. Since the thermal loops
were an intermediate step, the data obtained from
them are not to be considered as design data.
Such data can be obtained only from systems that
more closely reproduce the proposed operating
conditions. However, thermal loops have proved
extremely useful in investigating corrosion mech-
anisms and in ascertaining relative effects of
system temperature and temperature drop.

The program was divided into two parts: a
search, consisting in a series of screening tests
based upon data obtained in preliminary capsule
tests,” for the best material for containing the
fluorides and a search for a method to render

forts were made to understand the chemical re-
actions and corrosion mechanisms involved in
both portions of the program. All loops were
operated for a standard time of 500 hr.

The composition of the fluoride mixture pro-
posed for use as a reactor fuel was changed
several times during the period of this investi-
gation. Because of economic reasons and limited
time, it was necessary to switch to a new fuel be-
fore work could be completed on the old one, which

EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

Equipment

The major equipment used in this investigation
was the thermal-convection loop. The advantages
and disadvantages of this equipment are discussed
in the “Introduction.” Figure 1 shows the con-
figuration which has been used as a standard,
except for a few minor modifications to some of
the early loops used in the screening series.
These early loops were filled through a flanged
line into the side of the surge tank rather than
through a Swagelok fitting in the top. The loops
were assembled by Heliarc welding with an inert-
gas backing. Figure 2 shows a partly assembled
loop, its support, and the location and method of
attaching both the heaters and the thermocouples;
Fig. 3 shows some loops in operation and the
location and type of insulation used.

The loops were heated by six sets of Hevi-Duty
tubular-furnace heating elements. Each set of
elements was 6 in. in length and 1 in. in inside
diameter. The heaters were centered on the pipe
and separated by means of ceramic spacers in-
serted in the ends. The heaters were connected
in two parallel circuits, and the power was supplied
from saturable-core reactors. This arrangement
provided for proportional control rather than on-off
control.

During the filling of the loop, auxiliary heating
was needed. The loop was heated by passage of
an electric current through the pipe itself, and the
expansion pot was heated by a coiled 1500-w
Calrod heater. Once the loop was filled, these
auxiliary heat sources were turned off and the
clamshell heaters were turned on.

Johns-Manville Superex insulation was used and
was applied as preformed semicylinders with a
wall thickness of 3 in. The two halves were wired
together, and the cracks were filled with Superex
cement. When the loops were operating at 1500°F,
the surface temperature of the insulation was about
200°F.

The major experimental difficulties encountered
were concerned with temperature measurement, |t
was necessary to measure the maximum and the mini-
mum wall temperatures, and it was desirable to know
the temperature at several intermediate points. The
temperatures were measured with Chromel-Alumel
thermocouples recorded on 12-point
Brown Electronik instruments. Ina dynamic system
the question arose as to what temperatures should
be measured and used for control. It was realized
that saturation and reaction rates in the liquid
would depend upon the temperature of the fluorides,
that corrosion rates would depend upon the inner
wall temperature, and that the outer-wall temper-
ature would be the easiest to measure. The di-
ameter of the loops was so small that an inserted
thermocouple well would change the flow con-
ditions; also, since the flow was laminar, it was
possible that the center fluid temperature would
be considerably lower than the outside fluid
temperature. Thermocouple wells could not be
drilled into the pipe walls, because they were too
thin. For these reasons, the only temperature that
could reasonably be measured was the outside
wall To obtain the outside wall
temperature, and one that would check the inner
temperature reasonably well, the thermocouple
beads were welded to the pipe wall with a con-
denser discharge welder and then covered with a
layer of Sauereisen cement. The maximum temper-
ature was measured % in. down the top horizontal
pipe, while the minimum temperature was meas-
ured 2 in. above the joint at the bottom of the cold
leg. Both these thermocouples were under the
layer of insulation. Other thermocouples, on ex-
posed sections, were covered by a layer of as
bestos tape. Before these precautions were taken,

temperature variations of 50 to 60°F were common.
Even with the above precautions the temperatures
should be regarded as being only relative and not
exact.

The power input to the loops was controlled by
Leeds & Northrup Micromax instruments operating
with Chrome l-Alumel thermocouples, which were
located between the first ond second heaters and
were welded on the vertical hot-leg section about
7 in. below the joint. A duplicate thermocouple
was always placed on the opposite side of the
pipe for use as a check and as a spare for control.

Procedure

One of the main advantages of the thermal-
convection loops was their simplicity of operation.
Since these loops had no seals or moving parts,
once filled they required very little attention. Dur-
ing filling, precautions were necessary to exclude
air and moisture, but those precautions would be
required with any corrosion test,

The following steps were necessary to place
the loop in operation, and some of them will be
discussed in detail:

1. machining parts,

2. preliminary degreasing of all parts with a
solvent degreaser,

3. Heliarc welding of all
bottom plug,

4. final degreasing and rinsing,

5. welding in either bottom plug or Swagelok
fitting,

6. testing for leaks with an air pressure and soap
bubble technique and by pumping to a 50-u
vacuum,

7. attaching heaters and thermocouples and
mounting the loop on a stand,

13. sectioning and sampling for examination.

The purity of the fluorides varied considerably,
since they had to be obtained from a single large
production facility rather than from a facility set
up especially for the corrosion test program. No
standard or fixed production procedure was used,
and since the production and handling of such
mixtures was ao new art, many changes were made
from batch to batch.
In general, fluoride 14 was made by the following

procedure. The sodium fluoride, lithium fluoride,
and potassium fluoride were mixed, melted under a
vacuum, and cooled to room temperature. The
uranium fluoride was added; then the batch was
remelted and mixed by stirring with ao stream of
argon.

The zirconium-base fuels were produced under
the supervision of W. R. Grimes of the Materials
Chemistry Division and were more highly purified
and more uniform. The dry ingredients were mixed
and then evacuated several times to remove all
the moisture possible. After the mixture was
melted, it was held at 1500°F and treated with
hydrogen for 1 hr to reduce all oxides and oxy
fluorides of uranium to UO,; it was then treated
with hydrogen fluoride for 2 hr to convert the UO,
to UF ,. The last step was to purge the mixture of
the excess hydrogen fluoride. This procedure has
since been modified for the fuels used in the main
investigation of zirconium fluoride—base mixtures.

Both types of fluoride mixtures were transferred
from the production vessel to storage cans. When
a loop was to be charged, the mixture was trans-
ferred by pressure from the storage can to the loop
through a sin. nickel or Inconel line. All con-
nections were made with Swagelok fittings. A
spark plug probe was used to indicate when the
loop was full. A sampler was placed in the trans-
fer line but was not used for the majority of the
loops discussed in this report.

The distribution of impurities in the fluorides
after circulation had to be determined, which made
it necessary that the loops not be drained but that
the fluorides be allowed to freeze in place. After
cooling, the loop was cut up into approximately
6-in. lengths, with six 2-in. sections used for
chemical and metallographic study. The location
of these sections (x) is shown in Fig. 1. After the
loops were sectioned, the pieces were turned over
to J. P. Blakely, of the Materials Chemistry
Division, who was responsible for removing the
samples and obtaining the required analyses.
Since no solvent had been developed for re-
moving the frozen fluorides from the sections, they
were melted at around 1125°F in a helium atmos-
phere. The sections were inspected visually, and
if any unusual phases were present, additional
sections were cut and submitted for a petrographic

 

examination. After the fluorides had been removed,
they were ground and submitted for chemical
analysis, and the small pipe sections were ex-
amined metallographically. Check samples of the
fluorides were obtained from the loop by drilling,
and they showed that no changes in fluoride com-
position or wall structure had token place during
the short melting period. If any layers were dis-
covered on the pipe wall during the metallographic
examination, a sample was submitted for an x-ray
diffraction study.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The investigation consisted in a series of screen-
ing tests to determine the most promising container
materials for circulating fluoride mixtures, a de-
tailed study of Inconel as a container material, and
a short, incomplete study of stainless steels.

Most of the observations made and conclusions
drawn in this report were based upon only one or
two runs. Many of them were checked in seesaw
tests, but this should not be regarded as com-
plete confirmation. As mentioned previously, the
loop tests were designed as an intermediate test
between static testing and pump loop testing. All
the conclusions were based upon loops operated
for the relatively short time of 500 hr. For these
reasons the data presented must be regarded as
tentative and not be used as design data for high-
velocity or high-temperature-gradient systems. It
is possible that there will be aon increase in cor-
rosion in going to high-velocity, high-temperature-
differential pump loops, as was the case in going
from the static tests to the thermal-convection
loops.

Various fluoride mixtures were used in this work.
Their nominal compositions’ and number desig-
nations are given in Table 1, Because of pro-
duction variables, actual compositions may vary
slightly from these figures.

Screening Tests

The initial effort in this program was the oper-
ation of a series of loops to determine which ma-
terials were the best suited for use in a plumbing
system for high-temperature fluorides. The ma-
jority of materials tested were those that showed
promise in static corrosion tests carried out by

groups under the supervision of D. C. Vreeland in
the Metallurgy Division® and F. Kertesz in the
Materials Chemistry Division. Fluoride 14 was
the liquid circulated in these loops.

The data from the loops operated as part of these
screening tests are given in Table 2. A bar graph
showing the relative times in which plugging oc-
curred with the various materials is shown in Fig.
4. Typical photomicrographs from the top portion
of the hot legs from four of these loops are pre-
sented in Fig. 5.

It was apparent from these data that the material
selected must be one which would not cause plug-
ging in the loop. The depth of corrosion was
necessarily of secondary consideration. Nickel
and Monel, which had been rated as the most likely
containers in the static tests, had to be rejected
because the thermal loop tests revealed excessive
mass transfer of metal from the hot-leg surface to
the cold leg. Figure 6 is a photograph of a mass
of nickel crystals that had collected on ao small
flat sample inserted in the bottom of the cold leg
of a nickel loop.

From the data obtained for the alloys tested, it
was apparent that the nickel-base alloys would
make the best containers for the fluorides. All
other alloys tested either caused plugging in less
than 500 hr or showed excessive mass transfer.

Inconel, a commercial alloy, was deemed suffi-
ciently resistant to fluoride corrosion to warrant
its selection as a material to receive additional
attention.

Since materials varying widely in composition,
such as the various stainless steels, iron, and
nickel, all showed plugging or at least severe
mass transfer, it was obvious that more than one
metal or compound must be involved. In the iron
and nickel loops the deposits were metallic, where-
as in the stainless steel loops they were non-
metallic. With the iron and nickel loops the mass
transfer was possibly caused by very small changes
in solubility with temperature. Changes of only a
few ppm would be enough to account for the
amounts of metal transferred.

A material shown to be unsatisfactory in these
tests should not necessarily be excluded for use
with other fluoride systems. Since the driving
force in a thermal-convection loop is very small,
the loop is quite easily plugged but may require
only slight changes in loop design, operating
technique, or fuel composition to operate for
500 hr. In another part of this report it is shown
that type 316 stainless steel loops can be oper-
ated if the fuel composition or the minimum temper-
ature is changed. Also, large isothermal pump
loops of type 316 stainless steel were operated

Corrosion of Inconel

the preceding section, Inconel was the material
that appeared most promising in the screening
tests. When the investigation was started, fluoride
14 was the mixture proposed for use as a reactor
fuel. It soon became apparent that fluoride 14
could not be used because isotopically separated
lithium was not available. The zirconium fluoride
fuels were then proposed but could not be ob-
tained immediately in sufficient quantity for test
ing. Therefore the corrosion study was continued
with the Inconel-fluoride 14 system. The maxi-
mum fluid operating temperature was set at 1500°F,
as in the reactor designs then being considered.
The cold-leg temperature was about 1300°F. A
time of 500 hr was arbitrarily selected as the
standard operating period. These conditions were
established as standard and were used as a base
the study of the variables reported; Table 3

gives the results obtained. Figures showing
samples taken from the hot legs of the loops are
presented in several sections of this report: loop

were operated over a considerable time span with
fuel from various batches that showed considerable
in chemical composition. Chemical
analyses of the fluorides after the loops had been
operated all showed an increase in chromium and
a decrease in iron content. The depth and in-
tensity of attack found in the hot legs of the loops
checked fairly well, except that the attack in
loop 211 was slightly less than that in the other
loops.

The following detailed description of loop 229
is presented as typical of the standard loops.
Photomicrographs of various sections showing the
distribution of attack around the loop are pre-
sented in Fig. 7. Sections 3 and 4 show that once
the attack started it proceeded quite rapidly. The

slightly in moving up the hot leg from section 3
to section 1, but the concentration of voids in-
creased considerably. In the upper hot-leg section
more general attack was found. It can be noted
that the deepest penetration and the first sign of
attack always occurred in the grain boundaries but
that voids occurred frequently within the grains of
the metal.

maximum increased only

The data obtained by analyzing the fluorides from
the sections shown in Fig. 7 are given in Table
4. As was true in about 75% of the loops, the
amount of both chromium and iron found in the cold
leg was slightly more than that found in the hot
leg. No systematic variation in uranium could be
found. In all loops the chromium concentration
increased during the run, while the iron decreased.
When nickel was present as an impurity, its con-
centration also decreased, but for these loops the
original nickel impurity was usually low.

Effect of Fluoride Composition. ~ Effect of Dif-
ferent Mixtures. — During the progress of the ANP
work a variety of fluoride mixtures have been pro-
posed as suitable fuels or coolants. With the ma-
jority of these fuels only exploratory corrosion
tests were carried out. In every case, the change
from one fuel or coolant to another was made for
reasons other than corrosion.

Inconel loops after they had circulated various
fluoride mixtures (see Table 1 for compositions).
The variation in attack is shown by the typical
hot-leg sections presented in Figs. 8 and 9. These
loops were operated not necessarily to give a
minimum amount of corrosion but to be as nearly
comparable as possible. In the case of fluoride 30,
it was shown that lower corrosion rates were
possible with changes in the production procedure,
and it seemed likely that similor reductions could
be made with the other compositions.

From the data in Table 5 it is apparent that the
maximum depth of attack did not vary greatly with
the different fluoride mixtures. An average maxi-
mum penetration of about 0.010 in. was typical.
The variation in the intensity of attack and in the
size of the voids in the metal resulting from cor-
rosion found with different mixtures was thought
to be caused mainly by differences in batch purity.
The mechanism of attack appeared to be the same
for all these fluoride mixtures and is discussed
in detail in the section ‘‘Mechanism of Corrosive
Attack.” This single mechanism was evidenced
by both the similarity in the voids and the similer
variations in chemical analysis.

As listed in Table 5, thin altered layers were
often present on the cold-leg surfaces. Efforts
by x-ray diffraction and spectroscopy to identify
these layers failed. It seemed that various metals
had been deposited on the cold-leg surface but
that their identities were lost through diffusion;
the resulting changes in the base metal were not
large enough to be picked up by the analytical
or diffraction techniques used. Any nonmetallic
particles found were usually identified as UO,.

 

with Inconel some mass transfer had taken place.

Effect of Uranium Fluoride. ~ Although variations
in depth of attack were fairly small, a close study
of the results showed one systematic trend: in all
cases the attack was both deeper and more in-
tense in the loops which circulated uranium-bearing
fluoride mixtures than in loops which circulated
similar mixtures without uranium fluoride. The
data are summarized in Table 6, and photomicro-
graphs of hot-leg sections from some of the loops
are given in Figs. 8 and 9.

Effect of Reducing Agents. — In static tests,
the alkali metals and zirconium were found® to
inhibit corrosion by fluoride 14. A program was
then set up to check several reducing agents under
the dynamic conditions found in the thermal-
convection loops.

Zirconium hydride was substituted for zirconium
metal in the loops because it is more stable at
room, or slightly elevated, temperatures and does
not absorb as many gases. It decomposes just be-
low the loop operating temperature to give very
fine particles of pure zirconium metal and nascent
hydrogen. Enough zirconium hydride for a final
zirconium metal concentration of 0.5% was added
to the expansion pot of a loop, and the fluorides
were charged in over the zirconium hydride.

The zirconium hydride addition to fluoride 14
almost completely eliminated the corrosion of
Inconel. The first photomicrograph in Fig. 10
shows the hot leg of loop 225. Some surface rough-
ness was found, but none of the usual subsurface
voids were present. An intermittent metallic-
appearing layer was found on the surface of the

hot leg and in some of the grain boundaries near
the surface. The second photomicrograph in Fig.
10 shows the cold leg of a duplicate loop (242).
A well-bonded layer on the surface filled up what
fabrication cracks were present. Unsuccessful
attempts were made by both x-ray diffraction and
spectrographic means to identify these layers.
When the fluorides from these loops were analyzed,
it was found that iron, nickel, and chromium had
decreased in concentration during the circulation.

The zirconium inhibited the corrosion by reduc-
ing the impurities in the fuel before they reached
the chromium. It was thought that the surface
layers were products of the reduced impurities and
excess zirconium metal and that they could be
eliminated if the fluorides were treated with zir-
conium hydride in the transfer pot and filtered
into the loop. The fluoride 14 itself remained
essentially unchanged when low concentrations of
zirconium hydride were added. The fuel from these
loops was examined petrographically by Hoffman,?
of the Materials Chemistry Division, but she failed

to find any reduced fuel components.” When
similar additions were made fo fluoride 27, some
reduction of the fuel did take place.

Titanium hydride was similarly added to loop
250. The addition of 0.5% titanium hydride de-
creased the corrosion to a maximum penetration of
0.0025 in. but produced a thin metallic layer,
identified by R. M. Steele by x-ray diffraction as
NigTi. Under a high magnification (750X) it was
revealed that the layer was actually made up of
several phases imposed one upon another, as can
be seen in Fig. 11, a photomicrograph of the hot
leg of loop 250. A similar layer was also found in
the cold leg.

On the basis of static tests, the alkali metals
also appeared to be effective corrosion inhibitors,
Therefore 0.5% of sodium-potassium alloy was
added to loop 224, in which fluoride 14 was circu-
lated. The maximum depth of attack measured
0.010 in., and although a reduction in intensity of

 

 

 

More recent work by improved techniques has shown
that the zirconium hydride works primorily by the forma-
tion of reduced uranium compounds, which change the
equilibrium conditions in the corrosion reactions. Since
metallic uranium will be formed, which alloys with the
container wall, the addition of zirconium hydride is not
a practical method for retardation of corrosion.

attack was noted, it was less than had been ex-
pected. It is possible that a more efficient mixing
of the sodium-potassium alloy and the fuel would
result in a greater improvement. It is also possible
that some of the sodium-potassium alloy was
vaporized while the fuel was being charged. A
similar addition, but more carefully controlled,
definitely caused a reduction in depth of attack
with fluoride 30. When the fluorides from the loop
to which the sodium-potassium alloy had been
added were analyzed, the maximum chromium con-
centration found was 520 ppm, which was additional
evidence of decreased corrosion. No fuel reduc-
tion products® could be identified by spectro-
graphic studies.

Since corrosion occurs by the leaching of chro-
mium from the alloy, it was reasoned that adding
chromium metal to the fuel before it was placed in
the loop might reduce the attack in one of two
ways: the attack might be slowed down in accord-
ance with the law of mass action, or the corrosive
impurities in the fuel might be reduced before the
fuel was charged into the loop.

Several attempts were made to add chromium
metal to the fluorides both before and after they
were charged into the loop. It proved surprisingly
difficult to add chromium metal to these mixtures,

and the results obtained were erratic and not re-
producible.

Oxide Removal Procedures. — In any corrosion
test the method of cleaning the metal surface
prior to testing is one of the most sensitive vari-
ables. It is desirable to clean the surface without
changing the basic corrosion mechanism or corro-
Many of the early failures with the
sodium loops were caused, or at least influenced,
by the cleaning cycle.

The standard cleaning cycle chosen for use on
the loops consisted in degreasing and inspecting;
making all welds with a helium backup to reduce

sion rate.

oxidation; degreasing; and inspecting with both
swab and borescope. It was realized that oxides,
whether initially present or formed during welding,
would not be removed by this procedure. The work
discussed in this section was an investigation of
possible methods for removing these
oxides without etching or otherwise changing the
surface. None of these methods were adopted as
a standard procedure.

A series of loops was cleaned by passing dried
hydrogen through them while they were heated to
above 1800°F. The loops were held at this tem-
perature for 1 hr or until the dew point of the exit
hydrogen was ~60°F. In most cases the dew point

several

21
was about =100°F at the end of 1 hr. The corro-
sion results from loops cleaned by this method
were quite erratic, and considerable grain growth
usually occurred. The size of the loops, varia-
tions in wall thickness, and variations in type and
thickness of insulation made it extremely difficult
to heat a laop uniformly; therefore temperature
gradients of less than several hundred degrees
were difficult to obtain. With these temperature
gradients it was necessary to heat most sections
of the loops into the range of rapid grain growth
(above 1850°F) to get the colder sections to the
cleaning temperature (1800°F). The resulting
large grains caused variation in attack and made
comparisons difficult. Because of the di
in control, this method was not considered as
being adaptable either to the loops or to the large
engineering components of a reactor.

The results obtained from the operation of loops
with sodium and sodium-potassium alloy, as well
as cleaning tests carried out by the group under
D. C. Vreeland, indicated that these metals would
the oxides without attacking the tube
wal Vreeland showed that, with small tem-
perature drops, temperatures in excess of 1450°F
were required for cleaning but that the time was
not critical. Several loops were filled with sodium-
potassium alloy, which was allowed to circulate
for 4 hr with the hot leg at 1600°F and the cold
leg at 1500°F. The sodium-potassium alloy was
drained while the loop was still hot. The erratic
variations in corrosion were traced to variations in
the oxides left in the loop after cleaning, The
oxides were left as deposits in cold sections of
the loop and as a solid deposit when the loop was
drained. The oxides from the weld scale had
been converted to alkali-metal oxides with low
solubilities. This cleaning method is feasible
where a cold bypass or filter may be used to re-
move the oxides, but not for the thermal loops.

Effect of Hot-Leg Temperature. — Two loops
were circulated with fluoride 14 at temperatures
other than the standard temperature of 1500°F.
Loop 218 was circulated at a hot-fluid temperature
of 1300°F and loop 222 at a hot-fluid temperature
of 1650°F. Photomicrographs of typical hot-leg
sections from both loops and from standard loop

229 are presented in Fig. 12. Some increase in
depth of attack was noted with increasing tempera-
ture: from a maximum of 0.010 in. at 1300°F to
0.015 in. at 1500°F and to 0.018 in. at 1650°F,
At the higher temperature fewer voids were found,
but they were much larger and showed more
tendency to migrate to the grain boundaries. Con-
siderable grain growth also was noted.

Crevice Corrosion. — Although the accepted
mechanism of corrosion in the fused fluorides
would net be expected to lead to crevice corrosion,
a direct test was desired, inasmuch as crevices
may be present in the hot portion of a reactor
plumbing system where tubes join to headers. In
order to make such a fest, two crevices were
built into loop 223. The pipe was sawed through
in two places near the center of the hot leg, and
the cut ends at each place were secured by a
sleeve welded over the outside of the pipe. Thus,
at each end of the section which had been cut out,
a crevice opening into the fluorides existed be-
tween the sleeve and the outside of the pipe wall,
The maximum attack found in the upper crevice
was from 0.006 to 0.008 in., while that on the in-
side of the pipe wall, from the same area, was
from 0.004 to 0.007 in. Although the increase in
maximum penetration was small, the attack was
While the
attack was not so severe in the lower crevice, the
same relationships to that on the inside of the
pipe wall were found.

As an additional check on crevice corrosion,
the top welds from standard loops 219 and 229
were examined. The welding techniques used
had resulted in an incomplete weld penetration,
and hence crevices were present on the inside of
the loops. The increase in corrosion in such a
crevice is apparent from Fig. 13, a photomicro-
graph of the top weld of loop 219. The maximum
penetration of the wall in this area was 0.003 in.,
while in the crevice the attack was 0.006 in. deep
and several times as intense. Similar results were
obtained with loop 229.

These results indicated that crevice corrosion by
the fused fluorides was not a serious problem.
The most likely explanation for the small increase
in corrosion found in the crevices is that the

crevice reacted with the fuel and caused the in-
crease in attack in the crevice. In the loop itself,
sufficient fuel and agitation were present to dilute
ony effect caused by the weld scale on the pipe
surfaces.

Mechanism of Corrosive Attack. — The theory
that was developed during this work to explain the
mechanism of corrosive attack by fluoride salts
must be regarded as tentative, even though much

evidence is available to support it.

To determine what changes took place in the
pipe material, concentric samples were drilled
from the inside of both the hot and cold legs of
several loops. Chemical analyses of the drillings
from loop 229 are presented in Table 7. These
data show that chromium was leached from the
hot-leg wall to a depth beyond the maximum depth
at which the attack was visible under the micro-

high as in the external, or standard, sample.

scope.

Figure 14 is a plot of the change in chromium con-
centration with depth. With one exception all the
points lie quite close to a straight line. From
other evidence it appears that the solubility of
chromium in the fuel in these temperature ranges
is between 3000 and 3500 ppm. The chromium
concentrations for loop 229 were in this range,
but for most loops they were approximately 2000
ppm.

Any changes in the iron and nickel content of
the drilled hot-leg samples were small. The nickel
percentage did change, but mainly because the
chromium was depleted. Except in the first two
samples, both the iron percentage and the iron-
to-nickel ratio remained constant. In other loops
no variation was found even in the surface samples.
In the surface samples from the cold leg the iron
content was higher, as was expected, since iron
and nickel were deposited out of the solution.

The depth to which the alkali metals were found
in the drillings was surprising. While the maximum
attack extended to 0.018 in., traces of alkali
metals were found in the 0.020- to 0.025-in. cut.
Enough sample was not available from these
drillings for fluoride analysis, so the form in which

the metals are present is not known. The ratio of
the alkali metals, as shown by these analyses,
varied greatly both from sample to sample and
from that in the fuel (Na, 1; K, 10; Li, 4). Further-
more, the total amount of the alkali metals, on
either a weight or a molecular basis, was much
less than the amount of chromium removed. It is
possible that the presence of alkali metals in
the deeper samples resulted from poor sampling,
either through nonconcentric drilling or from runout.

During metallographic examination of the hot-leg
sections, an area was noted near the surface that
etched differently from the remainder of the sample.
In this area carbides were no longer visible. This
layer extended slightly deeper than the visible

25
attack and followed the line of the attack. A hot-
leg sample from a standard loop was submitted to
the International Nickel Company for study of this
layer. It was found that apparently the carbon had
not been leached out with the chromium but had
gone back into solution in the metal, The carbon
content of the surface layer and that of the re-
mainder of the pipe were the same.''

While examining some sections from a loop,
W. C. Tunnell noted that the inner pipe surface
had become magnetic. Some chemical samples
drilled at about this same time were then tested,
and it was found that the magnetism decreased
with depth but that a few magnetic particles were
still present in the last cot. The surface layer
in the cold leg was also magnetic, The presence
of these magnetic layers was also confirmed
metallographically; when the sample was covered
with a colloidal dispersion of iron and made the
core of an electromagnet, the iron collected on
the magnetic portions of the alloy. Figure 15
shows the magnetic oreas of the hot and cold
legs of loop 229. The heavy black line is the
area where the magnetism begins; it is heavy be-
cause the particles from the unaffected surface
moved to this area.

The presence of magnetic layers on the hot-leg
surface was additional confirmation that chromium
had been leached out. When chromium is added to
nickel, the Curie point is lowered quite markedly.
An alloy with 8% chromium has a Curie point at
about room temperature, while that of pure nickel
is at 665°F.'2 The addition of iron to nickel raises
the Curie point, and presumably it would do the
same in these alloys. The Curie temperature for
commercial lnconel is approximately —40°F, Since
the Curie point of the specimens which had been
exposed to fluorides was above room temperature,
the change must have been caused by the removal
of chromium,

In the examination of hot-leg sections one strik-
ing fact is apparent. In spite of the depth to
which the attack extends, there is very little
elongation of the voids in this direction; all voids
are nearly spherical. With normal intergranular
attack, the voids are shaped like worm holes,

sonal communication to W. D. Manly.

with definite elongation in one direction. In an
effort to follow the course of separate holes, a
sample was examined metallographically, reground,
and then re-examined at depths increasing by
0.00025 to 0.0005 in. From this study it was
apparent that at least the majority of the holes did
not connect to the surface or to each other. This
conclusion was substantiated by a vacuum leak
test on a section from which the outer, unaffected
area had been removed by machining. Tests with
dye penetrants produced the same results.

In view of the above facts, W. D. Manly proposed
a mechanism to explain the formation of the holes.
It had been established that chromium was selec-
tively leached from the alloys by the fluorides
and that the chromium at the surface of the pipe
was replaced by a diffusion process. In a dif-
fusion process that is unidirectional, there will be
a change in the density and/or shape of that
portion of the specimen in which the composition
is changed. Since diffusion in metals is believed
to occur by migration of vacancies from the surface,
it may produce a concentration of vacancies in the
lattice that exceeds the ‘‘solubility limit" for
vacancies at the test temperature. [If this limit is
exceeded, the vacancies will “precipitate” from
the lattice, collect at discontinuities, and grow
to visible voids whose size will be a function of
time and temperature, Such formation of voids
has been observed in many bimetallic diffusion
couples, and it has been demonstrated that identi-
cal effects can be obtained in metal-liquid and
metal-gas systems in which similar diffusion
phenomena occur. ®

The removal of the chromium from the Inconel
surface takes place by several chemical reactions.
Since these are primarily chemical problems and
are still under study by W. R. Grimes and F. F.
Blankenship in the Materials Chemistry Division,
they will be discussed only very briefly, From the
data developed, the reactions listed below appear
to be the most probable ones for removing the

a relatively short time and requires the addition
to the fluorides of between 1000 and 2500 ppm of
chromium, depending upon the temperature.

Corrosion of Type 316 Stainless Steel

It was pointed out in the section on ‘Screening
Tests" that all tests in which fluoride 14 was cir-
culated in a stainless steel loop were terminated
because the loop became plugged. Since stainless
steels are such well-known engineering materials,
a few tests were carried out fo see whether the
corrosion could be prevented by slight modifi-
cations in operating conditions or fluoride compo-
sition,

Effect of Temperature. — A series of type 316
stainless steel loops were operated at different
temperatures to ascertain whether plugging could
be prevented by a slight increase in the cold-leg
temperature. The data from these loops (presented
in Table 8) showed that the plugging was tempera-
ture sensitive. Loop 123, which was operated
with a minimum cold-leg temperature of 1500°F,
was the only one to be operated for 500 hr, A
similar loop, with the same hot-leg temperature
but with a slightly lower cold-leg temperature,
became plugged in 91 hr. The longer time for the
loop with a hot-leg temperature of 1300°F to be-
come plugged was probably caused by a lower
corrosion rate.

In the loop that was operated for 500 hr a layer
up to 0.001 in. thick was transferred to the cold-
leg surface. This layer was identified by dif-
fraction and spectrographic methods as being
iron with some chromium in solution. Such a layer
would not cause plugging but could interfere with
proper heat transfer,

Plug Identification. — The nature of the plugs in
the type 316 stainless steel loops is not definitely
known. Although the standard temperature used
for melting out the fluorides for examination was
about 100°F below the minimum cold-leg tempera-
ture, all the material in the loop flowed out. Loops
were also sectioned longitudinally without dis-
closing an apparent plug. D. C. Hoffman, of the
Materials Chemistry Division, made a petrographic

28

examination of several of these loops before the
fluorides were melted out and found'® that the
only substance likely to form a plug was K,NaCrF,
which has a physical appearance very similar to
the fuel and would be difficult to detect visually.
This compound melts at around 1850°F, but it
would probably separate from fluoride 14 at about
1500°F under the conditions existing in the loops.
Crystals of this compound might form as dendrites,
which could collect together in a tangled structure
similar to a log jam. Without being a complete
plug, such a mass could furnish enough resistance
to stop circulation in the loop. This is known to
be the mechanism operating with metallic plugs.
The few crystals holding such a mass to the side
of the loop could be broken during freezing and
remelting, and thus might not have interfered when
the fluorides were melted out for examination.

Analysis of the fluorides melted from these
loops showed that the chromium content was con-
siderably higher in the cold leg, where the plugging
presumably occurred. This result would be ex-
pected if the plugs were formed by K ,NaCrF .

Effect of Fluoride Composition. — Many of the
early large-scale engineering tests were carried
out with type 316 stainless steel loops containing
fluoride 12. Inconel parts for the loops were not
available at that time, and the use of fluoride 12,
which contains no uranium, required no accounta-
bility, Later, several loops were operated with
zirconium fluoride~base fuels in order fo test the
proposed theory of plugging. Data obtained from
these loops are presented in Table 9, and repre-
sentative hot-leg sections are shown in Fig. 16.
The compositions of the fluoride mixtures are given
in Table 1.

Of the four mixtures included in Table 9, fluoride
14 was the only one that caused plugging. The
proposed theories of plugging are substantiated
by the fact that the zirconium-base fuels, which
contained no potassium, did not form plugs. The
corrosion rate in the two loops with fluoride 12
was probably too low for enough material to be
furnished to form a plug.

the type 316 stainless steel loop in which NaK

photomicrograph in Fig. 16 which shows the cor-
rosion by fluoride 12 indicates that NaK reduced
the attack on type 316 stainless steel, as well as
on Inconel.

The depth of attack was no greater in the type
316 stainless steel loops that were operated for
500 hr than it was in Inconel. In stainless steel
the attack was concentrated at the grain boundaries
to a greater extent than in Inconel. However,
more mass transfer was found with all fuels tested,

graphic analysis showed the layer to be mainly

Loop 126, also listed in Table 9, circulated
fluoride 14 through which hydrogen had been
bubbled. The loop was operated with a hydrogen

overpressure. Although this loop became plugged,
it was operated longer than the standard loops.
The hydrogen reduced the nickel and part of the
iron present as fluorides. Therefore chromium
was not taken into solution so rapidly, and the
rate of plug formation was reduced. (It now seems
likely that this effect was actually caused by re-
duction of some of the uranium, although such a
reduction was not found with the techniques avail-
able at the time.)
