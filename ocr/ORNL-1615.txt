ABSTRACT

The critical experiment program on the Direct Cycle Aircraft Propulsion
Reactor was planned jointly by General Electric Company and the ANP group

of Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The experiments were performed by the
Laboratory group at the Oak Ridge Critical Experiment Facility.

A cylindrical assembly having a core composed of alternate layers of
hydrogeneous material and of an open lattice of stainless steel and metallic
uranium approximately 36" long and 51" in diameter was constructed. The
assembly was reflected by a 6" thick annulus of beryllium around its circum-
ference and 6" of AGOT graphite on the ends which covered both the core and
the beryllium jacket. The reactor required a critical mass of 41 kilograms
of uranium enriched to 93.3% U-235, and used Plexiglas as a mock-up moderating
material. Two mock-ups of the Direct Cycle Reactor are reported here. In one
of these modifications the moderator, the fuel disks and the stainless steel
supporting layers for the fuel disks were horizontal. The second mock-up con-
sisted of a series of concentric rectangular shells formed by the rotation of
an appropriate quantity of the core materials from a horizontal to a vertical
position.

Core type fuel and moderator removal control rods were calibrated by
both the stable period and the "rod drop” methods.

Power and neutron flux distribution studies were made on microscopic
and macroscopic bases for both these assembly mock-ups. Aluminum catcher
foils in contract with the U-235 metal were used in the power distribution
measurements and the flux distributions were determined by indium foil
activation.

Measurements were made of the changes in reactivity resulting from the
removal of a section of the beryllium reflector and the substitution of other
materials for it. Losses in reactivity were also measured in terms of the
separation of the two halves of the assembly at midplane and compared with
calculated values, treating the assembly as & bare thermal reactor. Reason-
able agreement was obtained between experimental and computed values.

Evaluations were made of certain experimental poison rods and of sub-
stituting limited amounts of molybdenum for stainless steel and of graphite
for Plexiglas.

The end reflector was removed from approximately one eighth of the
assembly and a stack of Plexiglas erected and other alterations made to
further mock-up the Direct Cycle Reactor. The effects of these changes
on the reactivity and neutron flux were determined.

I. INTRODUCTION

This report is a summary of the information contained in five progresa
reports, of limited circulation, published at intervals during the course
of these experiments. Since these progress reports were of limited cir-
culation and available only to those directly connected with the project, it
seemed advisable to make the information obtained from the critical experiments
available on a wider basis in the form of an overall report.

A description of the program of the critical experiments to be performed
by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory contributing to the design of the Direct
Cycle Nuclear Reactor by the General Electric Company is given in their Doc-
ument DC-51-11-6, dated November 5, 1951, entitled "9213 Critical Experiment
Program", and supplements, dated December 1h, 1951; June 12, 1952 and others
subsequently issued as work on the program progressed.

The first mock-up of the reactor as actually constructed consisted of a
right circular cylinder, with axis horizontal, and a core 36" long and 51"
nominal diameter containing 41.2 kilograms of uranium or 38.5 kilograms of U-235.
The H to U-235 atomic ratio was 225. The core composition by volume fractions
was as follows: Plexiglas (to simulate water) 0.319; stainless steel 0.043;
uranium 0.00185; aluminum 0.063 and voids 0.573. It was assembled in a matrix
of square aluminum tubing which will be described later. This mock-up, in
which the Plexiglas was in horizontal layers separating groups of six layers
of an open structure of type 302 stainless steel sheets holding the uranium
metal disks, was designated ag the "shelf type assembly”. This mock-up is
also referred to as CA-5.

The second mock-up consisted of a series of concentric rectangular shells
formed by rotating an appropriate number of Plexiglas strips and their accompany-
ing structure of stainless steel sheets and fuel disks from a horizontal to a
vertical position. This rotation was supplemented by minor changes in some core
and reflector materials but with no change in the amount of uranium present.

This modification, which will also be described in detail later, was known as the
"rectangular shell type assembly" and was used to obtain additional data pertin-
ent to concentric annuli in the design of the Direct Cycle Reactor. This mock-
up is referred to as CA-6. Additional minor changes were made to the rectangular
shell type assembly during the course of the experiments and this third mock-up
is designated as CA-T.

"II. DESCRIPTION OF EQUIPMENT AND ASSEMBLIES

A, Permanent Equipment:

 

The critical experiment assembly has been adequately described in

other reports, and only a brief description of the components which

are essential to understanding of current experimental. techniques

will be included here. Such features as shielding, interlock system,
safety systems and scrams. are omitted since they have very little bearing
on these experimental results.

Assembly Structure

The assembly apparatus consists basically of a matrix of square

2S aluminum tubes stacked horizontally which, when assembled,
form a 6' cube and into which the reactor materials may be placed.
The 6' cube is divided into. two identical halves, except that one
is stationary and the other can be moved by remote control a dis-
tance of 5' from the stationary half. Each half consists of 276
tubes, stacked in a 24 x 2L cell array. These tubes are 36" in
length, 3" x 3" outside, and O.OLT" wall thickness. Part of the
reactor materials are placed in each half and the assembly is made
critical by control rod adjustment after the two halves are to-
gether. Figure'l is a photograph of the two halves of the assembly.
(The materials visible in the upper portion of the moveable half
have no relation to the Direct Cycle Reactor.) The moveable half
is driven by a power screw coupled by gears to a 1 HP. D.C. shunt
wound motor. The speed of the motor and the reducing gears 1s so
adjusted that the moveable half approaches the fixed half with a
speed of 33" per minute between 5' and 8" separation, 6" per
minute between 8" and 2", and 1" per minute between 2" and the
stopping position of the moveable half. Positions of the moveable
half relative to the fixed half are indicated to 0.01" over the
entire 5' travel by a Selysn Veeder-Root mechanism coupled to the
power screw. Separations less than one half inch are indicated

to 0.001" by Starrett Micrometer dial indicators coupled through
Autosyn LOO cycle Selsyns to points at the bottom of the matrix.
The precision of Jone incremental separations of the two halves
was the order of¥ 0.001". Due to a lack of parallelism of these
facing halves, however, the inaccuracy of the overall separation
was estimated to be about 0.02".

Instrumentation

The radiation level of the reactor 1s monitored by eight in-
dependent instruments: a scintillation counter, a fission
chamber, and six BF3 filled neutron detectors, two of which are
proportional counters and four are ionization chambers. Leakage
radiation is measured by placing, the detectors at varying dis-
tances from the reactor core. @f special interest in the present
experimental procedures are the logarithmic meter and the pile
period meter, both of which derive their incoming signals from a
BF; ionization chamber, and are used in the calibration of the
control rods. The logarithmic meter records power levels over a
range of approximately 6- 1/2 decades, and the period meter records
instantaneous pile periods from infinity to plus 3 seconds and from
infinity to minus 30 seconds. Stable pile periods may be observed
directly from the slopes of the curves traced by the logarithmic

recorder.

Core Construction

The enriched uranium metal is in the form of circular disks
approximately 0.01" thick with diameters of 2.860" and 1.430"
and masses of 18.0% 0.1 and 4.5 + 0.1 grams respectively. Since
it was not possible to roll uranium metal foil of sufficient
uniformity for this small mass tolerance, many of the disks

had small holes punched in them for mass adjustment. Each

disk had a 0.196" hole drilled in the center. The fuel ele-
ments were assembled by placing the large disks on 3.6" centers
above an open array of three sheetb of stainless steel and cover-
ing them with an inverted three plece open array. Because of
insufficient large disks, it was necessary, in some cases, to
substitute small ones. Quarter size fuel elements were also
assembled and used near the circumference to approximate a cir-
cular core from square elements. Photographs of the fuel elements
are shown in Fig. 2.

The moderating material, Plexiglas, which has been shown to
simulate water in thermal neutron systems, was in horizontal
layers, one inch thick. The separate layers support the open
structure of stainless steel and fuel disks as shown in Fig. 4.

Some details of the core construction are shown in the loading
chart, Fig. 3. The numbers and letters in the cells show the
positions of the safety and control rods respectively. Safety
rods 1, 2, '3, and 4 and control rods A and B are in one half of
the assembly and an equal number are in the other. The assembly
was critical with some of the control rods removed. Correction
for the accompanying voids, based on an empirical calibration of
the rods -in units of mass of uranium indicates the "clean" critical
mass to be L4l.1 kilograms of uranium or 38.4 kilograms of U-235.
The structure of the control and safety rods 1s, of course, the
game as that of the fuel elements.

Reflector Construction

The core of the reactor is enclosed in an end reflector of 6"

"of AGOT graphite and a nominal 6" thick side reflector of beryllium.
The beryllium thickness varies slightly because the annular reflector
is fabricated from square pieces. The graphite end reflector extends
to the outside surface of the beryllium annulus. The control and
safety rods contain the graphite reflector. A photograph of the
assembled core at the midplane is shown in Fig. bL.

Conversion from Shelf Type Assembly to the Rectangular Shell (RS) Type.

The conversion from the shelf type critical assembly, shown in Fig... 3
to the rectangular shell (RS) type shown in Fig. 5, consisted essen-
tially of the rotation of the planes of the fuel disks, the stainless
steel sheets and the moderator strips from a horizontal to a vertical
position in approximately one half of the core cells. The effect on
reactivity of the rotation of these core materials has been calculated
and is contained in Appendix A. Minor changes in the amounts of core
materials.were made by substituting stainless steel sheets for Plexi-
glas in the central cell, M-12, in which control rod A was located.

It 1s recalled that the control.and safety rods, all of which contain
fuel elements, extend from the end of the reactor to the midplane of
the core. The only change in the reflector was the addition of a 2"
layer of graphite reflector to one end, making it 8" thick, the other
remaining 6". The lengths of control rods A and B were thereby in-
creased 2".

No changes were made in the locations of the control rods and the

.safety rods nor in the amount of uranium in the core of the reactor.
‘Figures 6 and 7 are two photographs of the RS type assembly taken

at the :midplane perpendicular to the axis of the reactor. Figure 6
shows the overall loading and Fig. 7 shows, somewhat more in detail,

the arrangements of stainless steel and Plexiglas within the cells,
The vacant cells shown in the photographs indicate the locations of

either control or safety rods. The irregular boundary between those
cells which have the planes of the fuel elements vertical and those

in which they are horizontal is also visible.

If the rotation of the fuel, stainless steel and moderator strips

is in such a direction as to place the fuel adjacent to the beryllium
reflector the assembly is more reactive than when the rotation is in
the opposite direction since the latter puts a thick layer of hydro-
geneous material between the core and the reflector. It was estimated
that the RS type loading, as shown in Fig. 5, was less reactive than
the former shelf type by about one percent in pA k/¥eff.

Conversglén . from the Rectangular Shell to the Water-Cone Reflected
Mock-up.

The water-cone reflected mock-up was constructed to better simulate
water cooling channels of the reactor, ascertaining their effect on
the flux distribution and reactivity. This information, céupled

with the reflector studies, determined the severity of the penalty

associated with the contemplated. substitution of the iron-water

reflector for beryllium.

Reflector changes made in the (RS) type mock-up of the Direct Cycle.
Reactor to simulate the water-cone reflector proposed for the end of
the reactor were the following: .The six inch graphite end reflector
was, removed from one quadrant of one half of the assembly consisting
of the following cells: N-12; 0-11, 12; P-10 through P-14, inclusive;
Q-9 through Q-15, inclusive; R-8 through R-16, inclusive; S-7 through
S-17, inclusive; T-8 through T-16, inclusive; "u- 10 through U-14, in-
clusive. The Plexiglas in this group of 49 ¢olls was extended 10 1/4",
These alterations in the reflector made the reactor subcritical even

for by the addition of 36" lengths of beryllium to the following
cells: B-8 through B-16, inclusive; C-6, 7, 17, 18: D-5, 19; E-k,

23. The 6" graphite end reflector was removed from the portion of
the beryllium Jacket which was adjacent to the quadrant containing
the 10 1/4" Plexiglas extension and replaced by a 10 1/4" beryllium
extension meking the reflector the same length as the altered. core.
The final change consisted of erecting a stack of Plexiglas, approx-
imately 12" thick, adjacent to one end of the reactor and starting
at the table top and terminating at top of the following cells: Q-7,
R-6, S-5, T-5, U-5, V-5 and W-6. The vertical edge of this Plexiglas
stack, which simulated the water-cone, was 3/4" from the end of the
aluminum matrix. The width of the simulated water-cone began at the
first safety and control rod supporting column and extended to within
about 1/2" of the edge of aluminum matrix.

The change in reactivity produced by the removal of the graphlte and
the extension of the Plexiglas in the 49 cells listed in the loading
change was a decrease of 85.2 cents. The addition of the 36" extension
to the beryllium reflector produced a gain in reactivity of 106.3 cents.
Gains in reactivity were also observed due to the 10 1/4" extension of
the beryllium reflector and to the erection of the simulated water-cone
in the amounts of 17 cents and 8.4 cents, respectively.

III. EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES ON SEELF TYPE ASSEMBLY

A.

Control Rod Calibrations:

The displacement of a calibrated control rod serves as a measure of

the changes in reactivity of a critical system. In the calibration

the changes in reactivity introduced by the linear displacement of a
control rod may be determined by either of two methods: 1) the measure-
ment of the stable period resulting from the reactivity change, and

2) the "rod-drop" method.

1. The Period of a Super Critical System

A measurement is madd of the period of the super critical system

resulting from the insertion of a control rod. When the change
in reactivity is small, it 1s related to the super critical
period by the following expression:

have the same significance as in equation (1). Reactivity
results are reported in cents values to avoid the uncertainty

in the effective value of the delayed neutron fraction nec-
essary ‘in converting to k/keprr-”

 

"Rod -drop" Method

In this method a measurement is made of the transient occuring
when the safety rod is quickly removed from the assembly. The
change in reactivity in cents (A) may be computed from the
equation

N. .N

where No = power level at critical
Ny = extrapolated power level of the slow translent

at the instant the rod is removed

The change in reactivity produced by the linear displacement

of each control rod was determined by these two methods. The
supercritical period was measured for various increments of
displacement until the rod had been displaced ite full length

and the corresponding changes in reactivity were computed from
equation (2). Each of the safety rods which was ¢tolinear with a
sontrol rod,was evaluated from the transient occuring in the flux
as it was dropped. Evaluations of the safety rods were made from
equation (3) and compared, respectively, with the integrated value
of the symmetrically located control rod. Tahle I gives a summary
of the total rod evaluations, in cents, for the four control rods
and the values obtained by the rod drop method for the correspond-
ing safety rods. Typical data obtained in the incremental cali-
bration by the stable period method are shown in Figs. 8 and 9.

The change in reactivity occuring when the rod is withdrawn from
the reactor, plotted as a function of the rod position from the
midplane, is shown in Fig. 8, In Fig. 9 is plotted the change in
reactivity per unit displacement, the rod gensitivity, as a function
of the same rod position. The horizontal lines represent the aver-
age sensitivity over the incremental displacement. The peaks

that these peaks occur at the approximate positions where the

removal and then by the removal of the complete element.

It is believed that the precision of the rod drop method is
no greater than “+2 cents so that the agreement in some of the
above cases 1s perhaps coincindental.

In the course of the rod calibration experiments by the in-
tegrated period method it was noted that the positions of the
control-rods, when critical at an increased power level in a
reactor which has been operated for several hours reproduced,
within the limits of experimental error, the previous critical
positions at a lower power, whereas the reverse was not true.
That is, when the power was decreased by a factor of ten it was
found necessary, in order to re-establish a critical system, to
remove the control rod a few tenths of an inch beyond the po-
sition where the system had been critical at the higher power
level. .

This variation in rod position for criticality is attributed

to an effective source of neutrons arising from the Be (¥,n)
reaction which is relatively stronger at lower power levels
following operation at higher power. In order to minimize

errors arising from this source the following procedure was

used in the calibration of, say, control rod A. With the neutron
flux constant at the lower level sufficient excess reactivity was
introduced by inserting some rod, not A, to produce a stable period
of between 250 and 400 seconds. The power was allowed to increase,
on this period, approximately ten fold and the assembly was made
critical by withdrawing rod A. This displacement of A corresponded
to the observed period. The power was then reduced and leveled by
the appropriate manipulation of other rods and the procedure re-
peated, thereby evaluating successive increments of rod A. It is
believed that, except for the first measurement, the rod displace-
ment which produced the positive period is not exactly related to
the period because, at the lower level, the assembly 1s not critical

6.
due to the (¥, n) neutrons. In the Direct Cycle Reactor there
was no beryllium in the core and this effect may not have been
very large.

An investigation was made of the linearity of response of the
amplifier lon chamber circuit used in the period measurement
by comparing it, at several lower levels, with proportional
counters. A small deviation from linearity was found at power
levels above those used in the control rod calibrations so the
results are not significantly in error-.

B. Temperature Effects

At various times during the operation of reactor assemblies vari-
ations have been observed in the day-to-day settings of control

rods required for criticality under constant loading conditions.

In the work reported here these variations exceeded the sensitivity
required to detect the reactivity differences produced by some
structural changes under study. Investigations have indicated the
probable cause to be ambient temperature irregularities. The sta-
bility of the room temperature has been improved so that the exit

air temperature is constant to one half Fahrenheit degree at 80°F.

An empirical relationship between reactor temperature and reactivity
has been established. The temperature, measured at two points in

the matrix with an iron-constantan thermocouple, has been varied
from 63°F to 80°F by altering the room temperature and allowing
sufficient time for the temperature throughout the reactor to equal-
ize. The attending reactivity differences, from’the reactivity at
72.9°F, were measured in terms of previously calibrated control rods
and are plotted as a function of temperature in Fig. 10. It 1s noted
from this graph that the reactivity increases with Increasing temper-
ature, i.e. fuel control rods must be removed from the reactor to
maintain criticality if the temperature increases. It 1s realizeéd
that, if reference is made .to a reactor: temperature coefficlent, the.
sign of the coefficient is opposite to that expected for hydrogeneous
systems. The effect 1s possibly due to thermo-mechanical changes in’
the assembly which are complex because of structure, loading and oper-
ation. It might also be noted that an experiment in which the reac-
tivity as a function of the Plexiglas thickness was measured, showed a
maximum at a thickness slightly less than one inch. The above tem-
perature effect may be accounted for, at least in part, by consider-
ing the concomitant change in density as effectively altering the
thickness of the Plexiglas. No systematic investigation of this
phenomenon has been made. If, during experimental operations, tem-
perature variations hecame severe the empirical relation of Fig. 10
allowed the interpolation of all reactivity data to some arbitrary
value. It has also been shown that, to at least the first order, the
magnitude of the temperature effect, 1.25 ¢/Fo, is independent ‘of the.
experimental ‘structural changes described below.

C. Reflector Studies

Some comparisons have been made of the reactivity effectiveness of
the beryllium reflector and of one of a Plexiglas-stainless steel
composite.

1, Reflector Comparisons With Constant Void Thickness

A very approximate value of the beryllium reflector was obtained
by removing beryllium sections, 22" long from cells M-21, V-11
and W-11 of Fig. 3. It 1s to be pointed out that these measure-
ments were made before the shelf-type mock-up was in final form
and when the length of the beryllium jacket was 44" with no:
graphite end reflector behind the beryllium. The initial purpose
of the experiment was to compare the reactivity value of a re-
flector element with that of a fuel element in order to ascertain
the most satisfactory location of a safety rod. For this reason
only a 22" length, i.e. half of the reflector length, of beryllium
was removed and the resulting reactivity change ascertained from
a calibrated control rod. In each case the data compare the
beryllium filled tube with an empty one. The error in the re-
sults, as given in Table II, is estimated to be. ¥ 14.

Test Cell Reactivity Increase in Cents
M-21 hh
V-11 10.9
V-1ll and W-11 27.5

The reactivity change for cell M-21 was checked by the rod drop
method and found to be the same within limits of experimental
error. This change is small because of the presence of the one
inch layer of Plexiglas in the core cells adjacent to thls reglon
of the reflector. The changes obtained for cells V-1l and W-1l
were expected to be larger since the removal of these two re-
flector cells opens a partial. void extending deep into’ the reactor.

In a second serles of experiments, with final reactor geometry,
a section of the beryllium reflector was replaced by a composite
of Plexiglas and stainless steel, each one-half the beryllium
thickness. The beryllium in a section 9" wide, 36" long and 6"
thick® was replaced by a 9" x 36" x 3" section of Plexiglas ad-
Jacent to the core and backed by a section of stainless steel,

* It mist be noted, that since the outside dimensions of the square aluminum
tubing is 3" x 3", the cross-section of the units of both the reflector and
the fuel is 2-7/8" x 2-7/8", the remainder being the aluminum tubing wall
and air space. For convenience in discussion the 3" dimension, and multiples
thereof, will be used to designate the reflector alterations. In the quan-
titive presentation of data, actual thicknesses of material will be stated,
with the understanding that the voids are present.

at three positions at the side of the reactor, at the top and at
the bottom.

The results, giving the changes in reactivity effected by the sub-
stitutions and the locations of the reflector alterations using the
designations of Fig. 3, are tabulated in Table III. The system was
more reactive with the beryllium reflector ° than with the combination
of stainless steel and Plexiglas. un NS : Son

2. Variable Reflector Void Width and Thickness of Stainless Steel and
Plexiglas Constant.

A larger slab in the reflector, 15" wide, 36" long and 6"
thick, occupying cells K-21 through 0-21 and K-22 through 0-22,
inclusive, was selected and measurements made in the following
order. The beryllium was removed in 3" x 36" x 6" thick units,
the first being at the center, M-21 and M-22, next N-21, 22, .then L-21
and L-22, etc., until all cells in the group were vacant, the system
being made critical between each removal. It was, of course, ne-
cessary to add some additional beryllium reflector near the top and .
glides of the reactor to override the reactivity loss due. to this re-
flector removal at the bottom. The successive changes in reactivity,
due to these reflector alterations, were noted from the critical po-
sitions of the control rods. The void was then filled with a com-
posite reflector of 1-7/8" of Plexiglas and 3-7/8" of stainless steel,
the former being adjacent to the core. This composite reflector was
loaded step-wise in the reverse order to the removal of the beryllium,
and the successive increments in reactivity measured.

Table IV contains the losses in reactivity for various void widths and
also the losses per unit width of the vold as the beryllium 1s re-
moved from the reflector.

* An analysis of the steel is given in Appendix B,

Figure 12 1s a graph of the loss per unit width plotted as a function
of the same distances, that is, the slopes of curves in Fig. 11. As
the leakage path becomes wider, the incremental value of the reflector
approaches a constant value.

3. Variation of Bottom Reflector Composition

In another series of studles In these cells, K-21 through 0-21
and K-22 through 0-22, the relative thicknesses of Plexiglas and
stainless steel in the composite reflector were varled for two over-
‘all thicknesses. For one series of measurements the thicknesses of
‘the individual layers varied from zero to the nominal six inches and
in the second series from zero to four inches. The accompanying
changes in reactivity were noted for each incremental thickness.

Variation of Side Reflector Composition

Since the planes of the fuel and the Plexiglas moderator in
the shelf-type mock-up were horizontal it is apparent that the
reflector savings per unit of reflector perimeter was a function
of its location. For this neason the above experiment was re-
peated in a test section 9" wide, 36" long and 6" thick at. the
side of the core using cells V-11 through V-13 and W-11 and
through W-13. 'The width of the test section was reduced from 15"
to 9" in order to remain critical without increasing the loading
or adding excessive extra beryllium to the reflector.

Table VII contains date slowing the losses in reactivity as
a function of the thickness of the reflector materials. These
data are again referred to a complete beryllium reflector as rep-
resenting zero reactivity loss. Figure 14 is a graph of the losses
in reactivity plotted as a function of Plexiglas thickness.

with a composite one of stainless steel and Plexiglas.

5. Effect of Void Between Core and Reflector

A preliminary experiment was run in which about one-half of
‘one. 6" graphite: end réfléctor was withdrawn one Inch leaving a gap
between the end reflector and both the core and the beryllium side
reflector, The concomitant reduction in reactivity was 25.1 cents.
When this:gap was betweén the: end reflector and the core only, that
is with the graphiteiin:¢ontact withthe beryllium jacket,. the re-
activity decrease was only 17.4 cents.

D. Power Distribution and Neutron Flux Determination in Shelf Type Assembly:
1. Description of Foil Techniques and Counting Equipment

If an aluminum foil is in contact with uranium fuel while =a
reactor is in operation. the activity of the fission fragments
collected on the aluminum is a measure of the fission rate at
the surface of the fuel disk. Fission rates measured by this
method have ‘been shown to be the same as those obtained from counmt-
ing the uranium disks activated in this reactor. Essentially all
power distributions reported here were obtained by this "catcher
foil" method. The foils used were 2S aluminum disks, 2" in diameter
and 0.005" thick with a 0.5" hole in the center. These foils, in
all cases, were exposed 20 minutes, counted in a Radiation Counter
Laboratories gas flow proportional counter. Their activities were
normalized to 60 minutes after shut-down using an empirically de-
termined decay curve’. The counting time for each catcher foil
varied from 2 to Lt minutes which gave a minimum of 10° counts. The
average variation in successive counts from the same foil is slightly

less than 2%.

Indium folls were irradiated in the critical assembly for
a study of the neutron flux distributions. These foils were
5/16" in diameter, 0.01" thick and weighed 0.0288% 0.0001 grams.
They were composed of 90% aluminum and 10% indium by weight®,
with an equivalent indium thickness of 0.0004". These foils
were covered with cadmium 0.02" thick when it was desirable to
shield from the low energy neutrons. All indium foil activa-
tions were determined with an Atomic Instrument Co. Model 1010
binary scaler using an Amperex Model 120-C mica window’ Geiger
tube. Each foll was counted for two minutes on both sides in
each of four counters and the eight values were averaged after
they had been corrected for dead-time, background, decay and
counter sensitivity”. The average variation between successive
counts of a given foil is about 3%.

Since it was not possible to expose all the indium folls
necessary for one traverse simultaneously because of the result-
ing perturbations arising from interactions of the folls, it was
necessary to normalize the exposures .for variations in power level.
An aluminum catcher foil was located in the same position in the
reactor during each exposure and the appropriate ratio of their
activities was used for these normalizations.

Pigure. 15:18 a’ photograph .of some “oft: the materials: used in
obtaining power and flux distributions. An aluminum catcher foil
is located on one of the uranium fuel disks and some indium foils
are seen between the disks. The countersunk beryllium blocks were
used when the neutron flux was measured in the reflector. Some
cadmium boxes, used to cover the indium foils, are also shown.

2. Power Distribution In Shelf-Type Mock-Up

 

Three radial power distribution curves taken in the midplane
of the assembly, along a horizontal radius, a 45° radius and
along a vertical radius, are shown in Fig. 16. These power trav-
erses originate in Cell M-12, Fig. 3, and extend to Cells U-12, R-7
and M-k4 respectively. The vertical power traverse, which terminates
in Cell M-L, shows a comparatively large decrease in power as it
approaches the edge of the core. A zero order Bessel function of
first kind curve is included in‘ this figure for comparison.

The power traverses shown in Fig. 17 were measured parallel
to the axis of the assembly, one being along the axis through
Cell M-12, and the others along the periphery of the core, orig-
inating in Cells U-12, R-7 and M.-L at the termini of the three
radial power traverses. It should be noted that some of the data
were obtained from the aluminum catiher foils while other are
measurements of the fission product activity induced in the uranium

Division using the method of R. F. Lutz of General Electric Co. described
in a memorandum IC-51-3-29, March 1k, 1951.

validating the catcher foil technique, at least for this reactor.

The best fit zero order Bessel functions of the first kind
which represent these power distribution curves extrapolate to
a core diameter of 78" and a length of 49", Using these values
of extrapolation distances, reasonably good agreement was ob-
tained between the measured and calculated values of reactivity
losses due to separation of the two halves of assembly at the
midplane, which are tabulated in Section IV, Part D of this report.

Power Distribution in Unit Cell

 

Because of the inhomogeneity of both moderator and fuel in
this assembly, the distributions of power and neutron flux inside
the unit cell are of interest. Figure. 18 shows’ the vertical power
distribution in Cell M-12 when 0.002" thick fuel disks are in :
Cells L-12, M-12 and N-12 and parallel to the planes of the Plexi-
glas layers. This distribution was obtained by placing an aluminum
catcher foll on each face of the thin fuel disks. The curve drawn
through these relative activities assumes all the absorption be-
tween the fuel disks occurs in the stainless steel. The average
activity over the cell is approximately 89% of the maximum value.
The self shielding of the fuel disks and the fuel cadmium fractions
are discussed in detail in Part IV, Section G of this report.

Neutron Flux Distribution in Shelf-Type, Mock-Up

Macroscopic, or gross, neutron flux distributions were made
by placing, successively, bare and cadmium covered indium foils
at an equivalent position within each of the cells in the region
of interest. The position chosen was in the fuel plane between
the uranium disks as shown in Fig. 15. The results of the hori-
zontal traverses, taken radially at the mid-plane, and the axial
traverses are shown in Figs. 19 and 20, respectively. In Fig. 19
the foil activity is plotted as a function of the distance from
the axls of the reactor, parallel to the mid-plane, and in Fig. 20
the activity is plotted as a function of the distance from the mid-
plane along the axis of the reactor in Cell M-12. The vertical
radial traverse, Fig. 21, was also taken in the mid-plane and ex-
tends from cell M-12 vertically downward through the beryllium
reflector. It is to be noted that in this lower region of the core
the beryllium reflector is adjacent to a 1" layer of Plexiglas. No
folls were placed in this layer of plastic during these traverses
and the interpolation is based on exposures in a single cell which
will be described later. A curve of a zero order Bessel function
of the first kind is also included in this figure for comparison.

Flux Distribution in A Unit Cell

 

Inhomogeneous loading of a reactor produces local variations
in power and flux distributions which are of importance in re-
actor calculations. Bare and cadmium covered traverses were made
in a unit cell where both fuel thickness and -orientation could be
varied. The unit cell used was always near the center of the re-

actor where: the flux:is.relatively:constant over .a 3". test. section,

In a normal unit cell the fuel disk is located 2" from the
bottom of the test cell and 1" above the Plexiglas, producing

a flux in the cell which 1s symmetrical above and below the fuel
disks. The vertical flux traverses are, therefore, symmetrical
about the fuel plane.

Figure 2218 avdrawingiof & uit dell with: thetstainless
steel removed to show the relative positions of the fuel disks
and the outline of the Plexiglas in the bottom of the cell. The
lines A-A, B.B, etc. show the locations of various traverses
made through the cell. Figures 23; 2Ludnd 25! 'ghow three vertical
flux traverses, perpendicular to the fuel plane, taken through a
unit cell along the paths A-A in Cell M-12, B-B in Cell N-12 and
C-C in L-12 respectively. The reductions in neutron flux which
occur at the fuel disks are the results of shadow shielding by the
fuel and the neutron sinks produced by lumped fuel. The reduction
is less pronounced in the A-A traverse, Fig. 23, because the Indium
foil, in this traverse, was located over the center hole of the fuel
disk and the shadow shlelding was greatly reduced.

Three vertical neutron flux traverses were also made in a
unit cell between the fuel disks and the results are shown in
Fig. 26, 27 and 28. The increase in flux occurring at the fuel
plane along traverse D-D, Fig. 26, was verified experimentally,
although its cause is not fully known. Figures 27 and 28.indicate
that the flux along E-E and F-F, between the Plexiglas layers,
is essentially constant. Co

Determinations of neutron flux distributions in a unit cell
were also made with one 10-mil fuel disk replaced by five 2-mil
thick disks. Only fifteen 2-mil disks were available so a large
test volume was impossible. The thin disks were substituted in
cells L-12, M-12 and N-12 near the reactor midplane with their
planes parallel to the planes of the Plexiglas. The thin disks
vere equally spaced between the Plexiglas layer and the top of
the cell. The meutron flux distribution in cell M-12, along path
A-A Fig, 22, 1s shown in Fig. 29. This change caused the average
neutron induced activity in cell M-12 to decrease by about 8 percent.
In these traverses the indium foils were placed 0.25" from the center
of the fuel disk to avold the effect of the hole. The ratio of the
average thermal neutron activity in the Plexiglas to that in the
space between two adjacent layers of the plastic, with the 2-mil
disks loaded is 1.82 which is not significantly different from the
ratio when a 10-mil disk is used. The results of an experiment -
measuring the ratio of thermal neutron flux inside and outside the
Plexiglas will be given later.

Another set of experiments was done with five 2-mil fuel disks
each in Cells L-12, M-12 and N-12 placed perpendicular to the Plexi-
glas layers and parallel to the axis of the core. The thin uranium
disks were equally spaced between the vertical sides of the unit cells
and extended into narrow slots cut into the Plexiglas. Vertical trav-
erses, centrally located in the fuel disk array, were made in cell M-12
with the indium foils perpendicular to the Plexiglas and repeated with
the foils parallel to it. The activity of the foils which were :

than that in those which were parallel. The two sets of data
were normalized at a point 2" from the bottom of the cell and
are shown in Fig. 30. The minimum in the flux distribution
occurs at a point 1.5" from the bottom of the cell which 1s the
location of the center of mass of the fuel disks.

A measure of the flux distribution across the dlameter of
a 10-mil fuel disk was obtained from bare and cadmium covered
indium traverses across a disk located in cell M-12 and the
results are shown in Fig.3l. No foils, however, were located

EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES. ON RECTANGULAR SHELL! TYPE ASSEMBLY
A. Control:Rod Calibrations In: The Rectangular Shell Type Assembly:

The control rods in the rectangular shell type mock-up were call-
brated by the super-critical period method as described previously.
The rod drop method was not used for comparison. The reactivity values
obtained for three of these rods are comparable to those obtalned when
the planes of all the core materials were horizontal. The fourth, Rod
A, is significantly more effective in the rectangular shell type mock-
i" due to the change on the neutron distribution resulting from the
omission of the Plexiglas from this rod and also surrounding the rod
on all four sides by one inch layers of the plastic. It is interesting
to note that the rod calibration was not changed by a gap, in the axial
direction at the midplane of the core, of thickness up to 0.8": .° -

Detailed data for rod A are given in Table 1X and a summary for
all four rods in Table X.

Temperature Effects in Rectangular Shell Type Assembly:

The effect of temperature on reactivity in the rectangular shell
type assembly vas measured by the same procedure and over approxi.
mately the same temperature range as was used in the shelf type
assembly. . The increase .in. reactivity with. increasing temperature
observed was 1.43 Gents: per Fahrehhelti degree, compared.with the.
sdarlier value of 1.25 cents per Fahrenhelt degree.

Plexiglas Thickness Reactivity Coefficient:

The thickness of the Plexiglas moderator strips in five cells,
K-16 through 0-16, was varied and the changes in reactivity produced
were determined from the control rod positions. In Fig. 32 the
changes in reactivity in cents referred to the reactivity with one
inch strips, are. plobted .as a function of ithe. Plexiglas thickness.

This curve shows an optimum thickness of approximately 0.9 inches

for this region of the reactor at the operating temperature.
Effect of Separation of Core at Midplane on Reactivity:

It wags desired to determine the loss in reactivity due to the
geparation of the two halves of the reactor core, the limit of the
experiment to be a gap of one inch or a reactivity decrease of 100
cents, whichever occurred first.

The procedure used was to start with the two halves together
and, as they were separated in an axial direction, compensate for
the loss in reactivity by driving in control rods. The reactivity
loss for each increment of separation was then determined from the
control rod calibration curves. When all the control rods were in,
extra beryllium reflector was added to strategic areas and evaluated,
allowing withdrawal of the control rods, and the process was repeated,
with some overlapping in distance, until the desired magnitude of
separation had been achieved.

distances and the average values of the reactivity losses per unit

Reflector Studies on The Rectangular Shell Type Assembly:

1.

Stainless Steel, Plexiglas and Boral Composite Reflector

The test cells used in these reflector studies were K-21
through 0-21 and K-22 through 0-22. The beryllium reflector:
wae removed from these cells, on both halves of the assembly,
and replaced by stainless steel, except for a 5/16" layer
adjacent to the core which was filled with Boral¥* strips 36"
long. The system was then made critical by the addition of
beryllium reflector at locations remote from the test section
and by control rod adjustment, thereby measuring the loss in
reactivity. Keeping the overall dimensions of the test section
constant, the thickness of the stainless steel was reduced and
Plexiglas was added between the core and the Boral in a step-
wise manner until all the steel had been removed. The changes
in reactivity, referred to the all beryllium reflector, which
vere incurred by these reflector alterations are shown in Fig. 34.
An additional experimental point in this figure, designated as
2.9/16" Plexiglas and 2-7/8" stainless steel shows the effect of
removing the Boral from a Plexiglas-stainless steel composite.
Another point, measured with the Boral replaced by 5/16" of Plexi-
glas shows the effect of a 5/16" void between the Plexiglas and
the steel to be small. The effect of the removal of all materials
from the test section is also shown on the graph. :

Stainless Steel, Plexiglas and Cadmium Composite Reflector

The experiment described above was repeated with a layer
of cadmium substituted for the Boral. Since the cadmium sheets,
which were 0.02" thick and sandwiched between 5-mil aluminum,
were thinner than the Boral, the Plexiglas-steel composite was
correspondingly thicker. Changes’ in reactivity were measured
as the thickness of the Plexiglas, separating the core from the
cadmium sheets, was increased from zero to 2-3/16". As in the
preceding experiment, the total reflector thickness remained
constant. .The results are shown graphically in Fig. 35, where,
for reference, the zero reactivity change 1s again taken as that
with the normal beryllium reflector.

Neutron Flux Distribution through Stainless Steel, Plexiglas

Leverett, M. C. "The Direct Cycle Aircraft Reactor", Reactor Science
and Technology, 3, 7 (1953).

The Boral was prepared from a mixture of 35 weight percent B)C and
aluminum. This mixture is held between two aluminum sheets, each about
0.04" thick, forming a 1/4" sandwich containing 250 mg of boron per square
centimeter. The Boral strips were wrapped in masking tape to minimize
boron contamination.

these traverses the composite reflector consisted of an out-
side layer of 2-7/8" of stainless steel separated from a
2-9/16" Plexiglas inner layer by the Boral sheet. Figure

36 shows the results of these traverses, in which the various
activities are ‘plotted as a function of the distance from the
bottom of the test section. Figure 37 shows the cadmium
fraction computed from the relation

(where A refers to the activity induced in an indium foil
and the subscripts B and C indicate it to have.been bare

of the same distance.

~ Figure 38 shows the results obtained along the traverses
reported in Fig. 36, except that the Boral strips were omitted
and the space left void. Cadmium fractions were again computed
and are plotted in Fig. 39. No flux traverses not cadmium
fraction determinations were made with the stainless steel,
Plexiglas and cadmium composite reflector.

 

F. Danger Coefficient Type Evaluations in Rectangular Shell Type Assembly:

1.

Poison Rods

The changes in reactivity caused by prototypes of various
control rods in design by General Electric were obtained from

_ the positions of calibrated control rods-when the assembly was

critieal.

The solid strip of Plexiglas in the bottom of a test cell
was replaced by a piece through which a hole 5/8" in diameter
had been bored. The axis of the hole was parallel to the long
axis of the Plexiglas strip and equally spaced between the top
and bottom faces. A hole was also bored through the graphite
end reflector to match the one in the Plexiglas. The poison rod
vas Inserted into the hole with one end of the rod flush with the
midplane. The reactor was then made critical. The rod was dis-
placed 18", the end of the rod being at the end reflector-core
interface, the solid plece of Plexiglas replaced and the system
again made critical.

Table XII gives a description of the rods for identification,

“the matrix cells in which the evaluation was made and the decreases

in reactivity, in cents, incurred when the rods replaced the plastic.

" The three values recorded in Table XII and evaluated in cell I-12

were made after the conversion.of: one guddrant: of cone. half tof, the
assembly:.from the rectangular: shell. type, graphite reflected, to: the
water=cone' reflected mock-up: ..The..other four values were obtained
in the rectangular shell type assembly before the conversion.

2. Comparison of Molybdenum and Stainless Steel

The stainless steel sheets in three adjacent cells in one
half of the core were replaced by ones of molybdenum having the
same dimensions. The resulting change in reactivity was de-
termined, in terms of previously calibrated contrgl rod settings,
by bringing the reactor to criticality before and after the molyb-
denum sheets were introduced. The experiment was repeated in
three other positions in the reactor, using three adjacent cells
each time. Table XIII gives the group of cells used and the corres-
ponding gains in reactivity resulting from the substitution of the
molybdenum for stainless steel.

3. Comparison of Plexiglas and Graphite

Removal of the Plexiglas from an array of nine matrix
cells, K through M-16, 17 and 18, in one half of the assembly
incurred a loss in reactivity of 47.8 cents. When graphite was
substituted for Plexiglas in these same nine cells the loss
amounted to only 26.7 cents.

4, Effect of Arco Soil Sample on Reactivity

 

The loss in reactivity incurred when a small sample of Arco,
Idaho, s011* was introduced into the reactor was determined by
comparing the reactivity of the assembly when the soll sample
was placed in a stainless steel box 1" x 2-7/8" x 2.7/8", having
a wall thickness of 8 mils, located at the mid-plane of the reactor
core in cell M-12, to that of a void in a box of equal volume at the
sams location. The results show that with 161.4 grams of soil in
the box there was a loss of reactivity of 0.83 cents.

G. Power Digtribiition and Neutron Flux Determinations in Rectangular :-
Shell Type Assembly:

   

Axial and radial power traverses were made through the rectangular
shell type assembly employing the aluminum catcher foil technique which
has already been described. Since no fuel disks were located at the
center of the core, the axial traverses were extrapolated to the mid-
plane for normalization. Relative power wag then plotted as a function
of the distance from the core midplane. The one radial power distri-
bution which is reported was taken with all catcher foils 1.8" from
the midplane.

Neutron flux distributions in the rectangular shell type assembly
were determined using indium foils. In each case the bare indium
activation, the cadmium covered .indium activation and their differ-
ence are shown on each graph, plotted as a function of the appropriate
distance.

1. Axial Power Traverses

 

Axial power traverses were made through cells M-12, M-8, M-6
and M-L4. The small variations in relative power through cells
M-12, M-8 and M-6, do not Justify plotting separate curves for
each of these cells. There. is, however, an appreciable decrease
through cell M-4 and a separate curve is plotted. A summary of
the results 1s given in Fig. 40 and Table XIV.

Radial Power Traverse

One vertical radial power traverse was made 1.8" from
and parallel to the midplane starting at the axis of the
reactor and extending through the fuel plane of cell M-k.
The results of this traverse are shown graphically in Fig. Ll.
The large decrease in relative power which occurs along the first
few inches of this traverse is due to cell M-12 being surrounded
on all four slides by a one inch layer of Plexiglas which forms
the innermost: i of the series of concentric shells making up the
assembly.

The data represented by the last two points on thls curve
were obtained from aluminum catcher folls placed in contact
with the uranium fuel disk in cell M-L4, one foil being adjacent to
the stop and onecionithe bottom of this fuel,disk. ~The curve is.drawn
through points representing data obtained from the upper surfaces
of the fuel disks.

Factors Affecting Power Production by Fuel Disks

 

a. Self Shielding

If the fissionable material in a reactor is of high
density the neutron flux producing fissions is depressed,
a phenomenon known as fuel self shielding. The self shield-
ing of a 0.01" fuel disk was measured before the conversion
from the shelf type to the rectangular shell type mock-up.
by forming a sandwich composed of five 2-mil fuel disks
geparated by aluminum catcher folls. The results are sum-
marized in Fig. 42 where the experimental points are the
averages of catcher foil counting rates which varled less
than 1%. The distribution is assumed to be symmetrical
about the central disk and the experimental points have been
reflected about the plane of symmetry. The ratio of the aver-
age activity to that at the surface of the 10-mil disk is 88%.

b. Cadmium Fraction of Fuel Disk

 

The cadmium fraction for a fuel disk ls defined as the
fraction of fissions which are produced by neutrons having
energies below that of the cadmium cut-off. It ls obtained
by the relation:

Cadmium Fraction = ~B~ C
Fp
where F refers to the fission fragment activity on the
aluminum catcher foll and the subscripts B and C indicate
the uranium disk as having been bare or covered with cadmium.
Cadmium fractions for fuel disks were obtalned both before
and after the conversion from the shelf to rectangular shell
type mock-up from aluminum catcher foil measurements. All
cadmium fractions for fuel disks were measured at a distance of
1.8" from the midplane of the assembly. The results are sum-
marized in Table XV.

The plastic enclosing Cell M-12 in the RS mock-up appears
to increase the fraction of thermal fisslons there.

Absolute Power Determination

Absolute power in the rectangular shell type assembly was
determined by normalizing the. power traverses to absolute fission
rates by comparing a one-mil gold foil activation in the critical
assembly with that induced by the Oak Ridge National Iaboratory
Standard Pile. From this normalization the absolute power during
foll exposures was found to be approximately two watts.

Radial Flux Distributions
a. Traverses not in Plexiglas

Bare and cadmium covered indium activations were measured
along a vertical radius starting at the axils of the reactor in.
Cell M-12 and extending downward through the beryllium reflector,
terminating at the bottom of cell M-22. Data for these traverses
were taken with the indium foils located as near the mid-plane
as possible and not in the Plexiglas. Results are shown graph-
ically in Fig. 43.

These curves indicate that the flux in cell M-12 is high.
This flux distribution agrees with the peak found in the relative
radial power distribution shown in Fig. 41. The flux peak in
the beryllium reflector also corresponds to that found for the
shelf type assembly as shown in Fig. 21.

b. Traverses Through Plexiglas

Bare and cadmium covered indium traverses were made through
the Plexiglas starting at the axis of the reactor in cell M-12
and extending through the beryllium reflector along a horizontal
radius. The results are shown graphically in Fig. 44. The rela-
tively high values of the flux in cell M-12, which 1s surrounded
on four sides by one inch thick layers of Plexiglas, and the peak
in the beryllium reflector, which have been noted previously, are

again observed.

T. Neutron Flux Distribution at Plexiglas Intersection

The conversion from the shelf type to the rectangular
shell type of mock-up producéd intersections of the ver-
tical and horizontal layers of the Plexiglas strips ex-
tending radially from the four corners of cell M-12 at
azimuthal angles of about 45° both above and below the
horizontal. The object of the measurements noted here
is to study the flux distribution in the vicinity of one
of these intersections. The region selected is illustrated
in Fig. 46. The vertical colums of the matrix are indicated
by the notation at the bottom of the figure and the row se-
lected is noted on the right of the figure. The arrangement
of the Plexiglas may be clearly seen from the loading diagram,
Fig. 5.

Bare and cadmium covered indium traverses were measured
along a horizontal in the midplane with the indium foils
occupying the positions indicated by the small triangles
in Fig. 46. This figure also shows graphically the results
of the traverses.

8. Unit Cell Traverses

Bare and cadmium covered indium traverses were made
vertically across cell M-12 and extending through the one
inch layers of Plexiglas adjacent to the top and bottom of
this cell. This central cell contains stainless steel and
uranium fuel disks but no Plexiglas. It is, however, sur-
rounded by a one inch layer of Plexiglas on all four sides.
The results of these traverses are shown graphically in Fig. ALT.

9, Neutron Flux Distribution Around a Poison Rod

Two flux distributions, each mutually perpendicular to
the axis of one of the experimental poison rods supplied by

the General Electric Company, and designated as Rod #1%, were
determined. One traverse was in the .plane of the Plexiglas

layer and the other perpendicular to it.

The poison rod occupied the position in cell M-8 which
had been used during the reactivity evaluations and which |
has been previously described in this report. This position
is illustrated in Fig. 49. The foil positions for the hori-
zontal and vertical traverses are illustrated in Figs. 48 and
49 respectively, and the diagonally cross-hatched lines in °
these two figures represent sections through the Plexiglas.

The horizontal flux distribution is represented graph-
ically in Fig. 48 and the vertical distribution in Fig. L49.

All the flux distribution curves ‘taken in the vicinity
of the poison rod show a discontinuity at the surface of the
rod since it was not possible to make neutron flux determin-
ations inside the rod. In Fig. 48 those foils whose distances

V. EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES ON WATER-CONE REFLECTED ASSEMBLY

 

A, Traverses in The Water-Cone Reflected Assembly:

 

Bare and cadmium covered indium neutron flux traverses were
made through cells R-12 and U-12 parallel to the axis, in the
quadrant of the reactor in which the reflector had been altered
to represent a mock-up of the water-cone reflected assembly. The
traverses began at the mid-plane and extended through the simu-
lated water cone. Both the bare and the cadmium covered foils
were located in the Plexiglas strips one-half inch from the bottom
of the cells. The results of these traverses are shown graphically
in Figs. 50 and 51.

Bare and cadmium covered indium traverses were made through
cell H-12, in a quadrant of the assembly in which the reflector
was unaltered, for comparison with those of R-12 and U-12. Cell
H-12 is the same horizontal radial distance from the central rec-
tangular shell cell, M-12, as is R-12, Alsc safety rod No. 8
occupies the same relative position with respect to cells H-12
and M-12 as No. 7 occuples relative to cells R-12 and M-1l2. The
bare and cadmium covered foils were again located in the Plexiglas

traverses are shown in Fig. 52.

“No satisfactory explanation for the neutron flux peak observed
in the vicinity of the midplane in cell H-12 is immediately available.
Most other axial flux curves taken through thls assembly follow the
general shape of the zero order Bessel function of the first kind,
especially near the midplane. The dotted portion of the bare indium
activation curve shows this relation.

VI CONCLUSIONS

Results of the Critical Experiments on the various mock-ups of the
Direct Cycle Aircraft Reactor indicate satisfactory agreement between the
theoretical and experimental values despite the complexity of the assembly.
The agreement obtained between the measured and computed reactivity losses
due to separation of the two halves of the core at the midplane, based on a
homogeneous thermal reactor, gives added confidence to the application of
methods of reactor calculations to complicated assemblies.

The similarity of the results obtained for power distributions from
catcher foll activities and the counting of fission product radiations
directly from the fuel disks indicates that this method of measuring fission
rates and for normalizing indium foll exposures between different runs 1s
satisfactory for the neutron spectrum studied here. This eliminates the
necessity for counting the fuel element back-ground prior to exposure.

The fair agreement between the results obtained for rod calibrations by
the stable period and the rod-drop methods indicates that the latter may be
used with confidence. Since the rod-drop method is much less laborious,
it may be used to check the integrated value of control rods and to quickly
evaluate safety rods.

Somes effects observed during the course of the critical experiments
have not been thoroughly studied. Among these are the peak observed on
the control rod sensitivity curve; the peak in the reactivity vs Plexiglas
thickness curve; the increase in reactivity with an increase in temperature
of the assembly. Some of the changes in reactivity which accompany alter-
ations of the reflector in different localities have not been explained.

By BE. L. Zimmerman
CONVERSION FROM SHELF TO RECTANGULAR SHELL MOCK-UP

During the early stages of the critical experiments on the Direct
Cycle Aircraft Reactor, considerable controversy arose over the proper
method of including neutron streaming in the calculation of age. One of
the purposes of the comparison of the shelf and rectangular shell con-
figurations was to estimate this streaming effect. Whatever the magni-
tude of the streaming effect, it was anticipated that reducing the radial
straight line void distances would .result in an increase in multiplication.
Contrary to the expected effect, converting from the shelf to the rectangu-
lar shell configuration caused a substantial negative change in multipli-
cation.

While the original question was not answered, a partial explanation
for the negative change is given on the basis of a net shift of fuel away
from the region of greatest importance in the assembly.

To affect the change from the shelf to the rectangular shell type
assembly, approximately half the cells were rotated through 90° in such
a way that, in these cells, the fuel was moved 1/2" or 1.27 cm away from
vertical longitudinal midplane of the assembly, Call-this displacement a.
The component of the displacement a along a radius at an angle 0 ls given
by a cos 64 b represents the distance of a particular cell from the axis.

For a bare reactor of radius R having the asymptotic flux distribution of

the actual assembly, the radial part of the flux is given by § (v) = Jo(By 7),

where Bj, = 2.405 , 1s the radial bucking component. Since, in the asymptotic

approximation, the flux is self ajoint, the lmportance function is [¢ ire.
