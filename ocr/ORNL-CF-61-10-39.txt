Abstract

Equations which describe delayed neutron losses in external
loops of circulating fuel reactors were derived. A working equation
- | and the necessary input data for calculating delayed neutron losses
by an equilibrium reactor code such as ERC-5 are given.

DELAYED NEUTRON LOSSES IN CIRCULATING FUEL REACTORS

Circulating fuel reactors lose neutrons because some of the delayed
neutrons are emitted outside of the core. These losses depend on core
residence time, external loop residence time, and decay characteristics of
the precursors.

A symbolic representation of the system is

where

The boundary conditions are:

where
T, = time for the fuel stream to pass through the core,
Th = time for the fuel stream to pass through the external loops.

The solutions to Egs. (1) and (2) are:

Note that the precursor production rate is assumed constant for the fuel

stream during its stay in the core. This idealized case would exist only

for uniform power density along the fuel stream or for core residence times

 
which are short compared to the half-life of the precursor.
