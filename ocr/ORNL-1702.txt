SUMMARY

This report contains a summary of all the experimental density measure-
ments on molten fluoride mixtures that have been developed for the Aircraft
Nuclear Propulsion Project A correlation of these data 1s presented which
can be used to predict liquid densities of fluoride mixtures of known compo-
sition over wide, elevated temperature ranges

Experimental measurements were made by the buoyancy principle using
a plummet suspended in the molten salts from an analytical balance, the
entire system being enclosed in a dry-box

All the information available on compositions, experimental densities,
melting points and cubical coefficients of expansion may be found in this
report, calculated values of liquid and room temperature densities, mo-
lecular weights and molecular volumes of all the mixtures that have been

developed for the ANP program are also presented
INTRODUCTION

Since the outset of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion project, interest has
been centered on molten fluoride mixtures as the best potential circulating
fluids for use in high temperature reactors of the ARE type During the course
of the project, some fifty or more mixtures of fluorides have been suggested
and a number of these aroused sufficient interest to merit measurements of
their physical properties

In the early stages of the density research program the experimental
accuracy was somewhat lower than in the later stages During the former
period some questions concerning purity of both the molten salts and the
blanketing atmosphere arose Also, the techniques of temperature measurement
and control, and weighing facilities were refined during the latter period
As a result, the more recent determinations afford a somewhat higher degree
of accuracy than the earlier ones

The correlation described in this report 1s based on measurements on
all the mixtures that have been studied In a few instances, notably compo-
sition No 12 (Flinak), 1t has been possible to make a second set of measure-
ments on a mixture for which the properties had been measured very early in
the project, and in these instances the data listed below are the revised

values In past reports on several of the compositions, a correction based

 
[ -T- ©

on the volume change of the plummet with temperature was omitted, the error
introduced being well within the accuracy claimed for the data However, thas
correction has been applied where necessary in this report and i1t 1s suggested
that in subsequent studies involving the densities of fluorides, the data

in this report be used
DESCRIPTION OF EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

A Discussion of Method
Density values reported here were determined by the buoyancy principle
involving a plummet suspended in a liquid The density of the liquid, p,

1s defined by

0 = L (1)
VL, \
where,
wi, weight of liquid displaced by the plummet
vi, volume of liquid displaced by the plummet
and WL, = Wy = Wy, (2)
where,

Wp, weight of plummet in air

Wi, weight of plummet in liquid

Upon substituting (2) in (1), there results

_ Wp - Wy
ET (3)

p

_ - 9 -

The volume of liquid displaced by the plummet, vy, is also equal to the
volume of the plummet and may be determined by weighing the plummet in a
liquid of known density (water was used) At room temperature the volume of
the plummet is

Wp - WH,0 4
vy, = 2220 ()
PH,0

vhere,

WH,0» weight of the plummet in HnO at
room temperature

PHO, density of water at room temperature

The volume of the plummet at elevated temperatures is

Wy - WHO

Vy = Vio : + Po (r2,) = PEO

+p (0) (5)
2

where,
T, liquid temperature

To, room temperature
Bp, cubical expansion coefficient of

the plummet

Upon substituting equation (5) into equation (3), one obtains

(Va - Wp) PHz0 (6)
p= (Wy - W00) [1 + Bp (T-To)]

 
_ nt
Fa

Wa, WE50 and the temperature of water were measured before the experiment was
started Values for PHO and Po are known, values of Wr, at the various tempera-
tures were measured

Experimental density data are represented in this report by the equation

p =a - bl (7)
Values of the cubical coefficients of expansion were calculated from the

defining equation

BL = - = (&), (8)

The experimental data are given in Table 1 and in Figure 5 where the
temperature range over which measurements were made on each mixture is shown
The experimental data are also tabulated in Table 4 in the form of equation (7)
A simple analysis indicates that these data are probably not in error by more
than + 5% Experimental values for the coefficients of cubical expansion of

the various liquids may be found in Table 1

B Description of the Equipment
The system (see Figure 1) used for taking these measurements consisted

principally of a stainless steel plummet suspended in the molten salts by a

fine steel wire from a Voland 'Speedigram" balance (a chainomatic balance on
which weights larger than 100 mg are controlled mechanically by knobs with no
loss in accuracy) The plummets were fabricated from 1/4" No 316 stainless
steel rod The containers for the molten salts were fabricated from 1 1/2'

I PS, Schedule 40, No 316 stainless steel pipe The tube furnace was
mounted on a small rolling platform equipped with ball-bearing casters to
facilitate centering of the tube under the balance as well as under the two
systems for determining viscosities which were also housed in the dry-box
(Both density and viscosity measurements were made during the same heat-up
period Viscosity studies will be discussed in a separate report)

The temperature of the melt was measured with the aid of two chromel-
alumel thermocouples and a Brown multipoint recorder, the couples were inserted
in wells made of 1/8" stainless tubing and supported in the liquid salt so
that one couple was 2-3 inches below the surface and the other 5-6 inches
below the surface The wire supporting the plummet was of such length that
the plummet was suspended at a depth between the two couples Temperature
of the furnace was controlled by a combination of a variac and a
Simplitrol with a chromel-alumel thermocouple The hot junction of this
couple was imbedded in the outside surface of a thick-walled copper pipe used
as a thermal diffuser between the heating surfaces of the tube furnace and
the tube containing the melt Since this hot junction "sees' the heating
element face, a very sensitive temperature control was afforded As the

experiment progressed, the temperature setting was increased by a small

increment and 1n a short time the temperatures indicated by the two immersed
thermocouples rose to a point slightly below that set on the Simplitrol,
leveled off and approached each other, at this point the two readings were
usually no more than 5 degrees apart After this practically isothermal con-
dition was reached, a weight reading and the average temperature were recorded
Since the fluorides in the molten state are very sensitive to the atmos-
phere, a number of precautions were taken to insure its purity Argon was
circulated through the dry-box and out of a bubbler at a measured rate until
the calculated concentration of argon was sbove 99 9% These calerulations
have been checked experimentally by measuring the oxygen concentration of the
gas 1n the dry-box with a Burrell Gas Analyzer Effort was made to remove
the final traces of oxygen and water, these being the chief undesirable
impurities, by placing indicating Drierite from a closed container into a
flat open dish to get the water and by starting up an oxygen removal device
consisting of a tube furnace containing a cartridge of copper filings and
equipped with a 15 CFM blower The filings were brought to red heat and the
atmosphere in the dry-box circulated over them Purity of the atmosphere,
which determines the purity of the melt, 1s indicated by the appearance of
the plummet when 1t 1s withdrawn from the melt The plummet, though dis-
colored, will have a clean smooth surface when taken from a clean melt No
difficulty was encountered with condensation on the wire except during measure-
ments on mixtures containing ZrF) When working with these salts, the plummet

was removed between weighings and the tube containing the melt was covered

to retard the zirconium snow effect

EXPLANATION OF THE CORRELATION

Although more than fifty different fluoride mixtures have been developed
since the initiation of the ANP program, density measurements have been made
on only fifteen of these mixtures In addition, new mixtures are developed
as the program continues For these reasons i1t was felt that a method for
predicting densities of molten fluorides would be useful and the correlation
described below was developed

The correlation 1s based on plots of the experimentally determined liquid
densities at any one temperature against the calculated densities of the corre-
sponding mixture at room temperature These room temperature densities are
calculated by the formula

N

> wr,

pol (9)
> /ey)e,
1=1

where,

p, density at room temperature of the mixture
(gm/cc)

Mi, molecular weight” of a component of the
mixture (gm/mol )

f,, mol fraction of that component

p,, density at room temperature’ of that component
(em/cc)

 

Ihe values used for the various components are listed in Table 2
of the appendix

y 4 §
a 26 - bod

The numerator 1s the calculated molecular weight of the mixture and the
denominator 1s the calculated molecular volume of the mixture Values of

the room temperature density calculated from this formula were checked against
experimentally determined values for a series of 10 fluoride mixtures and
were found to differ by no more than + 5 percent (Reference 1)

Figure 3 gives the density-temperature data for all of the liquid fluoride
mixtures that have been studied to date (References 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12) The figures in parentheses are the calculated room temperature
densities The data given in Table 1 were used in drawing these curves It
1s noted that the average liquid densities are proportional to the calculated
room temperature densities of the corresponding mixtures

Figures 4a, 4b, hc and 4d represent plots of liquid densities against
the calculated room temperature densities of corresponding mixtures at 600°¢,
700°C, 800°C and 900°C respectively, these isotherms were cross-plotted from
Figure 3 Figure 5 1s a composite of figures ha, 4b, he and kd Knowing
only the calculated room temperature density, the liquid density may be pre-
dicted for any mixture of fluorides over this temperature range

Figures 6 and 7 were derived from Figure 5 and give the constants, a and
b, for equation 7, as a function of the room temperature density

The density correlation presented here satisfactorily represents all the
experimental measurements on the fluoride mixtures, the mean deviation is

about 3% and the maximum deviation 1s 6% Table 3 gives the calculated room

temperature densities, as well as compositions, molecular weights and
molecular volumes, for all the fluoride mixtures that have been formulated
in the ANP program (References 13 and 1h) and Table 4 lists the predicted
densities in terms of equation 7 for all of these mixtures as well as the
experimentally determined formulae to illustrate the agreement

Cubical coefficients of expansion at 700°C of the liquids calculated
from this correlation are inversely proportional to density and vary from
3 60 x 107% (1/°c) for a mixture having a room temperature density of

2 0 (gm/ce) to 2 37 x 107% (1/°C) for a mixture having a room temperature

density of 5 5 (gm/cc)
