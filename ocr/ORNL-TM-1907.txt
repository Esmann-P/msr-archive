CORROSION OF THE VOLATILITY PILOT PLANT INOR-8
DISSOLVER AFTER SEVEN COLD DISSOLUTION RUNS

E. C. Moncrief
A. P. Litman

ABSTRACT

The Volatility Pilot Plant dissolver vessel, based on ultrasonic thickness measurements,
seems to be sustaining low corrosion losses.

Wall thickness changes were measured for the Volatility Pilot Plant INOR-8 dissolver
after 204 hours of exposure to anhydrous HF and equimolar NaF-LiF fused salt contain-
ing 22-52 mole per cent ZrF4 at 495-655°C while Zircaloy-2 dummy fuel elements
were being dissolved. Measurements were taken using the "Vidigage, " an ultrasonic
thickness measuring device, first after an ammonium oxalate solution wash to dis-
solve residual salt, and later after an HNO3-AI(NOg)s rinse to remove any metallic
deposits that might have formed.

For the dissolver, maximum wall thickness losses were noted in the vapor region where
a maximum loss of 11 mils was found. This loss corresponds to 0.054 mils/hour, based
on HF exposure time, or 17.0 mils/month, based on molten salt residence time. Lower
losses occurred in the vapor-salt interface region, and still less in the salt region of
the vessel. Bulk metal losses due to the use of the oxalate and nitric acid-aluminum
nitrate solutions were considered negligible. OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABORATORY

The Volatility Pilot Plant has currently completed a series of seven
cold dissolution runs using Zircaloy-2 dummy fuel elements according to
the head-end procedure of the fused salt Volatility Process.” These runs
were designed to evaluate the HF dissolution step of the Volatility Proc-
ess.

A necessary part of thet evaluation was the determination of the

corrosion losses occurring on INOR-8, the material of construction for
the dissolver vessel

Table I summarizes the corrosion rate losses

nominal composition of INOR-8 is Ni: 71 wt %, Cr:

"The
and Mo: 16 wt %.

Twt %, Fe: Swt %,-

Table II details the process conditions for the seven
runs and indicates that equimolar NaF-LiF fused salt containing 22-52

mole per cent ZrF) was used at temperatures of 495-655°C along with 1160 kg
of anhydrous HF to dissolve eight dummy fuel elements

Figure 1 shows a
schematic of the hydrofluorination operation.

Wall thickness measurements were made prior to the development runs
and twice after run T-7 using an ultrasonic thickness measuring device,
the "Vidigage."

The first measurement after run T-7 followed a 41 hr

wash with boiling 0.35 M ammonium oxalate solution; and the second measure-
‘ment followed a 10 hr rinse with boiling 5 wt % HNO

379 wt 9 AL(NOS) 5. The
oxalate wash served to remove residual fused salt while the HNO

)~AL(NO

rinse dissolved any metallic deposits which might have formed on the dis-
solver walls during fuel element dissolution.

Figures 2, 3, and b present
the data obtained and show that measurements were made at 90° intervals .
around the circumference of the dissolver at three inch height increments.
The present operating orientation of the dissolver vessel is also indicated
Although a restricted number of readings were taken on the top oo
cylindrical section of the dissolver because of the presence of insulation,

sufficient data were collected to indicate that the vessel had lost an

     
  
 
 

average of 9.3 mils on the inside diameter of that section (see Fig 2)

* This loss corresponds to 0.045 mils/hr, based on HF exposure time. The

top section was exposed only to the process vapors except for occasional
salt splash. However, for comparative purposes, an average rate loss
figure of 14.4 mils/month, based on molten salt residence time was also
calculated, The maximum wall thickness loss in the vapor region of the
dissolver, 11 mils, did not deviate greatly from the average quoted.

The conical section of the hydrofluorination vessel was exposed to

" both process vapors and fluoride salts during the runs described. In

run T-7 the salt level was in the conical section; in all other runs salt
contact ‘was from splash. The average wall thickness loss found for this
section was b.2 mils, less than the 1% accuracy of the "Vidigage" instru-
ment, although e maximum of 10 mils loss was noted at one point (see

Fig. 3). Maximum rate losses were 0.049 mils/hr, based on HF exposure

time or 15.4 mils/month, based on molten salt residence time.

‘The bottom section of the dissolver consists of five cylinders of

5-1/2 inches inside diameter and varying length joined by circumferential

welds to form a right cylinder 9 feet in height. Thickness measurements
of this section did not disclose significant bulk metal loss (see Fig. 4).

However, two areas in the west quadrant did register unusual high and low

~ thickness changes. These irregularities may be due to. inaccuracies in the

‘base-line data collected on the dissolver vessel. Excluding the high and

low data mentioned, a maximum loss of 6 mils was found for the bottom
section,
Comparison of the thickness data before and after the nitric acid-~
aluminum nitrate rinse (Figs. 2, 3, and 4) indicated that negligible
changes occurred outside the accuracy of the "Vidigage" instrument.
The Volatility Pilot Plant dissolver vessel, based on ultrasonic

thickness measurements, seems to be sustaining low corrosion losses.
