ABSTRACT

The use of a molten-salt fuel makes possible the production of high-pressure, superheated
steam with a nuclear reactor operating at low pressure. The corrosion resistance of the INOR-8
series of nickel-molybdenum alloys appears to be sufficient to guarantee reactor component life-
times of 10 to 20 years. Proposed continuous fuel-processing methods show promise of reducing
fuel-processing costs to negligible levels. With p233 as the fuel and Th232as the fertile material
in both core and blanket, initial regeneration ratios up to 1.08 can be obtained at critical masses
less than 600 kg.
initially about 1300 kg. With U233 as the fuel, y233 is produced, and initial regeneration ratios

The corresponding inventory for a 600-Mw(th) central station power reactor is

in excess of 0.6 can be obtained with critical masses of less than 300 kg. The corresponding
critical inventories for 600-Mw(th) central station power reactors are 600 kg or less, depending on
the thorium loading. It is concluded that homogeneous, molten-salt-fueled reactors are competi-

tive in regard to nuclear performance with present solid-fuel reactors, and they may be economi-

cally superior because of lower fuel and fuel-processing costs.

 

Molten fluoride salts provide the basis of a new
family of liquid-fueled power reactors. The range
of solubility of uranium and thorium compounds in
the salts makes the system flexible and allows the
consideration of a variety of reactors, Suitable
salt mixtures have melting points in the range
850 to 950°F ond are sufficiently compatible with
known alloys to assure long-lived components, if
the temperature is kept below 1300°F. As may be
seen, molten-salt-fueled reactor systems tend to
operate naturally in a temperature region suitable
for modern steam plants; they have the further
advantage that they achieve these temperatures
without pressurization of the molten salt,

The molten-salt system, for purposes other than
intensive
research and development over the past nine years
under ORNL sponsorship has provided reasonable
answers to a majority of the obvious difficulties.
One of the most important advances has been the
development of methods for handling salt melts at
high temperatures and maintaining them at tem-
peratures above the liquidus temperatures. In-
formation on the chemical and physical properties
of a wide variety of molten salts has been ob-
tained, and methods were developed for their

electric power generation, is not new,

manufacture, purification, and handling that are in
use on a production scale. [t has been found that
the simple ionic salts are stable under radiation
and that they suffer no deterioration other than the
buildup of fission products.

The molten-salt system has the usual benefits
attributed to fluid-fueled systems, The principal
advantages claimed over solid-fuel systems are:
(1) the lack of radiation damage that can limit fuel
burnup; (2) the avoidance of the expense of fabri-
cating new fuel elements; (3) the continuous re-
moval of fission products; (4) a high negative
temperature coefficient of reactivity; and (5) the
avoidance of the need for excess reactivity, since
makeup fuel can be added as required. The last
two factors make possible a reactor without control
rods that automatically adjusts its power in re-
sponse to changes of the electrical load. The
lack of excess reactivity can lead to a reactor
that is safe from nuclear power excursions.

In comparison with aqueous systems, the molten-
salt system has three outstanding advantages: it
allows high-temperature operation at a low pres-
sure; explosive radiolytic gases are not formed;
and thorium compounds are soluble in the salts.
Compensating disadvantages are the high melting
points of the salts and poorer neutron economy;
the importance of these disadvantages cannot be
assessed properly without further experience.
Probably the most outstanding characteristic of
the molten-salt systems is their chemical flexi-
bility, that is, the wide variety of molten-salt
solutions which are available for reactor use. In
this respect, the molten-salt systems are practi-
cally unique, and this is the essential advantage
which they enjoy over the uranium-bismuth sys-
tems. Thus the molten-salt systems are not to be
thought of in terms of a single reactor — rather,
they are the basis for a new class of reactors.
Included in this class are all the embodiments
which comprise the whole of solid-fuel-element
technology: U?33 burners, thorium-uranium thermal
converters or breeders, and thorium-uranium fast
converters or breeders. Of possible short-term

interest is the U235 burner. Because of the in-
herently high temperatures and because there are
no fuel elements, the fuel cost in the salt system
is of the order of 1 mill /kwhr in graphite-moderated,
molten-salt-fueled reactors.

The present technology suggests that homo-
geneous converters using a base salt composed of
BeF, and either Li’F or NaF and using UF, for
fuel and ThF | for a fertile material are more suit-
able for early reactors than are graphite-moderated
or plutonium-fueled systems. The chief virtues
of the homogeneous converter reactor are that it is
based on well-explored principles and that the use
of a simple fuel cycle should lead to low fuel cycle
costs.

With further development, the same base salt
(using Li’F) can be combined with a graphite
moderator in a heterogeneous arrangement to pro-
vide a self-sustaining Th-U23% system with a
breeding ratio of about 1. The chief advantage of
the molten-salt system over other liquid systems
in pursuing this objective is, as has been men-
tioned, that it is the only system in which a solu-
ble thorium compound can be used, and thus the
problem of slurry handling is avoided.

PRIOR WORK

The applicability of molten salts to nuclear
reactors has been ably discussed by Grimes and
others.''2 The most promising systems are those
the fluorides and chlorides of the
These

appear to possess the most desirable combination

comprising
alkali metals, zirconium, and beryllium,

of low neutron absorption, high solubility of ura-
nium and thorium, and chemical inertness. In
general, the chlorides have lower melting points,
but they appear to be less stable and more cor-
rosive than the fluorides.

The fluoride systems appear to be preferable for
use in thermal and epithermal reactors. Many mix-
tures have been investigated, mainly at ORNL and
at Mound Laboratory. The physical properties of
these mixtures, in so for as they are known, have
been tabulated, and the results of extensive phase
studies have been reported. ®

Lithium-7 has an attractively low capture cross
section, 0.0189 barn at 0.0759 ev, but Lié, which
comprises 7.5% of the natural mixture, has a cap-
ture cross section of 542 barns at the same energy.
The cross sections at 0.0759 ev and 1150°F for
several lithium compositions are compared below
with the cross sections of sodium, potassium,
rubidium, and cesium,

Cross Section

Sodium 0.290
Potassium 1.130
Rubidium 0.401
Cesium 29

The capture cross sections of the lighter ele-
ments at higher energies presumably stand in
approximately the same relation as at thermal. It
may be seen that purified Li’ has an attractively
low cross section in comparison with the cross
sections of other alkali metals and that sodium is
the next best alkali metal.

The sodium-zirconium fluoride system has been
extensively studied at ORNL.% A eutectic con-
taining about 42 mole % ZrF, melts at 910°F.

Small additions of UF, lower the melting point
appreciably. A fuel of this type was successfully
used in the Aircraft Reactor Experiment (ARE).4
Inconel, a nickel-rich alloy, is reasonably re-
sistant to corrosion by this fuel system at 1500°F.
Although long-term data are lacking, there is
reason to expect the corrosion rate at 1200°F to
be sufficiently {ow that Inconel equipment would
last several years,

However, with regard to its use in a central-
station power reactor, the sodium-zirconium fluo-
ride system has several serious disadvantages.
The sodium capture cross section is less favorable
than the Li’ cross section. In addition, there is
the so-called ‘‘snow'’ problem; that is, ZrF , tends
to evaporate from the fuel and crystallize on sur-
faces exposed to the vapor. In comparison with
the lithium-beryllium system discussed below, the
sodium-zirconium system has inferior heat transfer
and cooling effectiveness. Finally, the expecta-
tion at Oak Ridge is that the INOR-8 alloys will
prove to be as resistant to the beryllium salts as
to the zirconium salts and that there is therefore
no compelling reason for selecting the sodium-
zirconium system,

The capture cross section of beryllium appears
to be satisfactorily low at all energies. A phase
diagram for the system LiF-BeF, has recently
been published.’ A mixture containing 31 mole %
BeF, reportedly liquefies at approximately 980°F.
Substantial
fluid may be obtained by blending this mixture with
the compound 3LiF-ThF,. A temperature diagram
for the ternary system has been published.’ The
liquidus temperature along the join appears to lie
below 930°F for mixtures containing up to 10
mole % ThF,. Small additions of UF, to any of
these mixtures should lower the liquidus tempera-

concentrations of ThF, in the core

ture somewhat.

The ARE was operated with a molten-fluoride-
salt fuel in November 1954. The reactor had a
moderator consisting of beryllium oxide blocks.
The fuel, which was a mixture of sodium fluoride,
zirconium fluoride, and uranium fluoride, flowed
through the moderator in Inconel tubes and was
pumped through an external heat exchanger by

means of a centrifugal pump. The reactor op-
erated at a peak power of 2.5 Mw. It was dis-
mantled after carrying out a scheduled experi-
mental program.

fn 1953 a group of ORSORT students, under the
leadership of Jarvis,” investigated the applica-
bility of molten salts to package reactors. More
recently, another ORSORT group led by Davies
prepared a valuable study of the feasibility of
molten-salt U235 burners for central-station power
production.® Fast reactors based on the U238.py
cycle were studied by Addoms et al. of MIT and by
an ORSORT group led by Bulmer.” Both groups
concluded that it would be preferable to use molten
chlorides, rather than the fluorides, because of the
relatively high moderating power of the fluorine
nucleus, although it was recognized that the chlo-
rides are probably inferior with respect to corro-
sion and radiation stability. Bulmer et al also
pointed out that it would be necessary to use puri-
fied CI37 on account of the (n,p) reaction ex-
hibited by CI35. Because of the disadvantages of
the chloride systems and, further, because the
technology of handling and utilizing neptunium-
and plutonium-bearing salts is largely unknown, it
was decided to postpone consideration of chloride
salt reactors.

In 1953 an ORSORT group led by Wehmeyer'®
analyzed many of the problems presently under
study. The proposals set forth in that report have
influenced the present program. A study by David-
son and Robb of KAPL'! has also been helpful.
Both studies considered the possibility of using
thorium U233 conversion-breeding cycle at
thermal or near thermal energies.

A recent conceptual design study'? of a 240-Mw
(electrical)
actor was used as a basis for examining the eco-
nomics and feasibility of a reactor using molten-
salt fuel. An attempt was made to keep the

METHOD OF CALCULATION

Reactor calculations were performed by means of
the UNIVAC program Ocusol,!'3 a modification of
the Eyewash program.'® Ocusol is a 31-group,
multiregion, spherically symmetric, age-diffusion
code. The group-averaged cross sections for the
various elements of interest that were used were
based on the latest available data.!> Where data
were lacking, reasonable interpolations based on
resonance theory were used. The estimated cross
sections were made to agree with measured reso-

the compatibility of fuel, graphite, and metal,
which has not as yet been established. For this
reason, the homogeneous reactors, although in-
ferior in nuclear performance, have been given
prior attention.

A preliminary study indicated that, if the in-
tegrity of the core vessel could be guaranteed,
the nuclear economy of two-region reactors would
probably be superior to that of bare and reflected

Any realistic appraisal

The study of homogeneous reactors was divided
into two phases: (1) the mapping of the nuclear
characteristics of the initial (i.e., ‘“‘clean’’} states
as a function of core diameter and thorium con-
centration and (2) the analysis of the subsequent
performance of selected initial states with various
processing schemes and rates. The detailed re-
sults of the first phase are given here. Briefly, it
was found that regeneration ratios of up to 0.65
could be obtained with moderate investment in

U235 (less than 100 kg).

Initial States

A complete parametric study was made of molten-
fluoride-salt reactors having diameters in the range
of 4 to 10 ft and thorium concentrations in the fuel
ranging from 0 to 1 mole % ThF,. In these re-
actors the basic fuel salt (fuel salt No. 1) was a
mixture of 31 mole % BeF. and 69 mole % LiF,
which has a density of about 2.0 g/cm? at 1150°F.
The core vessel was composed of INOR-8. The
blanket fluid (blanket salt No. 1) was a mixture of
25 mole % ThF, and 75 mole % LiF, which has a
density of about 4.3 g/cm? at 1150°F. In order to
shorten the calculations in this series, the re-
actor vessel was neglected, since the resultant
error would be small. These reactors contained
no fission products or nonfissionable isotopes of
uranium other than U?238.

A summary of the results is presented in Table 1,
in which the neutron balance is presented in terms
of neutrons absorbed in a given element per neu-
tron absorbed in U233 [both by fission and the (»,y)
reaction]. The sum of the absorptions is therefore
equal to 7, that is, the number of neutrons pro-
duced by fission per neutron absorbed in fuel.
Further, the sum of the absorptions in U238 and
thorium in the fuel and in thorium in the blanket

plotted in Fig. 2, range from 0.5 for the minimum
mass reactor to 0,63 for the largest mass reactor.
It does not seem likely that further increases in
diameter or thorium concentration would increase
the regeneration above 0.65.

The effects of changes in the compositions of
the fuel and blanket salts were studied in a series
of calculations for salts having more favorable
melting points and viscosities. The BeF. content
was raised to 37 mole % in the fuel salt (fuel salt
No. 2), and the blanket composition (blanket salt
No. 2) was fixed at 13 mole % ThE, 16 mole %
BeF,, and 71 mole % LiF. Blanket salt No. 2 is a
somewhat better reflector than No. 1, and fuel salt
No. 2 is a somewhat better moderator than No. 1.
As a result, at a given core diameter and thorium

Reservations concerning the feasibility of con-
structing and guaranteeing the integrity of core
vessels in large sizes (10 ft and over), together
with preliminary consideration of inventory charges
for large systems, led to the conclusion that a
feasible reactor would probably have a core di-
ameter lying in the range between 6 and 8 ft. Ac-
cordingly, a parametric study of the No. 2 fuel and
blanket salts in reactors with core diameters in
the 6- to 8-ft range was made. In this study the
presence of an outer reactor vessel consisting
of % in. of INOR-8 was taken into account. The
results are presented in Table 2. In general, the
nuclear performance is somewhat better with the
No. 2 salts than with the No. 1 salts,

Neutron Balances and Other Reactor Variables

The distributions of the neutron captures are
given in Tables 1 and 2, where the relative hard-
ness of the neutron spectrum is indicated by the
median fission energies and the percentages of
thermal fissions. It may be seen that losses to
lithium, beryllium, and fluorine in the fuel salt
and to the core vessel are substantial, especially
in the more thermal reactors (e.g., case No. 18).
However, in the thermal reactors, losses by radia-
tive capture in U235 are relatively low. Increasing

the hardness decreases losses to salt and core
vessel sharply (case No. 5) but increases the loss
to the (=,y) reaction. The numbers given for
capture in the lithium and fluorine in the blanket
show that these elements are well shielded by the
thorium in the blanket, and the leakage values
show that leakage from the reactor is less than
0.01 neutron per neutron absorbed in U235 in re-
actors over 6 ft in diameter, The blanket con-
tributes substantially to the regeneration of fuel,
accounting for not less than one-third of the total,
even in the 10-ft-dia core containing 1 mole %

HOMOGENEOUS REACTORS FUELED WITH u233

Uranium-233 is a superior fuel for use in molten-
fiuoride-salt reactors in almost every respect. The
fission cross section in the intermediate range of
neutron energies is greater than the fission cross
section of U23°. Thus initial critical inventories
are less, and less additional fuel is required to
override poisons. Also, the parasitic cross sec-
tion is substantially less, and fewer neutrons are
lost to radiative capture. Further, the radiative
captures result in the immediate formation of a
fertile isotope, U234. The rate of accumulation
of U236 is orders of magnitude smaller than with
U235 as a fuel, and the buildup of Np237 and
Pu239 is negligible.

The mean neutron energy is somewhat nearer
thermal in such reactors than it is in the cor-
responding U235 cases. Consequently, losses to
core vessel and to core salt tend to be higher.
Both losses are reduced substantially at higher
thorium concentrations because of the hardening
of the neutron spectrum,

Results from a parametric study of the nuclear
characteristics of two-region, homogeneous, molten-
fluoride-salt reactors fueled with U233 are given
in Tables 3 and 4. The core diameters considered
range from 3 to 12 ft, and the thorium concentra-
tions range from 0.25 to 7 mole %.
tion ratios are very good compared with those ob-
tained with U235, With 7 mole % ThF, in an
8-ft-dia core, the U233 critical mass was 1500 kg,
and the regeneration ratio was 1,09.

The regenera-

The data in Table 3 are for reactors using fuel
and blanket salts No. 1 with ThF , concentrations
ranging up to 1 mole %. The critical masses are
graphed in Fig. 3 and the regeneration ratios in
Fig. 4. The masses range from a minimum of about

20 kg in a 5-ft-dia core, with no thorium present,
to 130 kg in a 10-ft-dia core having 1 mole %
thorium in the fuel. The corresponding regenera-
tion ratios are 0.60 and 0.90. For a given thorium

NUCLEAR PERFORMANCE OF A REFERENCE
DESIGN REACTOR

A conceptual design study of a 240-Mw (electri-
cal) central-station molten-salt-fueled reactor (MSR)
was described by the Molten-Salt Reactor Group at
ORNL.'® The system employs a two-region homo-
geneous reactor having a core approximately 8 ft
in diameter and a blanket 2 ft thick.

The core, with its volume of 113 ft3, is capable
of generating 600 Mw of heat at a power density in
the core of 187 w/cm3. The general arrangement
of the core and blanket is shown in Fig. 7. The
basic core salt is a mixture of lithium, beryllium,
and thorium fluorides, together with sufficient
fluoride of UZ3% or U?33 to make the system

eutectic of LiF and ThF,, or mixtures of it with
the basic core salt. The liquidus temperature of
the fuel salt is about 850°F and that of the blanket

is 1080°F or lower.

Both the core fuel and the blanket salt are circu-
lated to external heat exchangers, six in parallel
for the core and two in parallel for the blanket.
The heat is transferred by intermediate fluids from
these heat exchangers to the boilers, superheaters,
and reheaters, The heat transfer system is de-
signed so that, with a fuel temperature of 1200°F
a steam temperature of 1000°F at 1800 psi can be
achieved.

The volume of fuel salt external to the core in
the transfer lines, pumps, and heat exchangers was
estimated to be 339 ft3, [t is this external volume
that largely determines the fuel inventory of the
system. A parametric study of the regeneration
ratio as a function of critical inventory in this
system was performed. With U233 in reactors em-
ploying core and blanket salts No. 1, the results
are as shown in Fig. 8, where regeneration ratio is
plotted vs critical inventory, with thorium con-
centration in the fuel as a parameter, The numbers
associated with the plotted points are the di-
ameters of the cores.

The curves are observed to peak rather sharply,
and these peaks define a locus of maximum re-

generation ratio for a given inventory. It may be

seen that, with no thorium in the core, a regenera-
tion ratio of 0.5 can be obtained with an inventory
of 100 kg of U235 in a 7-ft-dia core. The addition
of 0.25 mole % thorium to the core salt yields a
regeneration of about 0.6 for an inventory of 200 kg
in a 7-ft-dia core. Optimum core size increases
hereafter. Also the rate of increase of regeneration
ratio falls off substantially. With 0.75 mole %
thorium, a regeneration of 0.67 is obtained with
400 kg of fuel in a 10-ft-dia core. As mentioned
it was felt that it would be difficult to
fabricate reliable core vessels having diameters
greater than 10 ft, and, accordingly, larger cores
were not investigated. However, an examination of
the curves indicates that further increases in tho-
rium loading and core diameter would probably
not increase the regeneration ratio above 0.7.

above,

Reactors employing core and blanket salts No. 2
(see Table 4) require somewhat lower inventories
than the corresponding cores using salts No. 1,
as shown in Fig. 9. The 8-ft-dia core, for instance,
requires only about 600 kg of U235 with a loading
of 1 mole % thorium, whereas with the No. 1 salts,
about 850 kg was required,
ratios, however, are about the same, ranging from

0.62 to 0.64 for the 8-ft-dia cores.

with U©~7,

Regeneration ratios of the order of 0.6 can be ob-
tained at inventories of about 100 kg of U?33.

Increasing the thorium concentration up to 7
mole % gives a monotonically increasing regenera-
tion ratio, up to about 1,09, but the fuel inventories
become very high. The performance of cores having
diameters ranging from 4 to 12 ft and thorium con-
centrations of 1, 2, 4, and 7 mole % are shown in
Fig. 12. The dashed line is the estimated envelope
of the curves shown and represents the locus of
maximum regeneration for a given inventory. It is
seen that regeneration ratios above 1.0 can be ob-
tained from fuel investments of 400 kg or greater.
Also, it appears that the 8-ft-dia cores give about
the highest regeneration at all thorium concentra-
tions. In Fig. 13 the performances of 8-ft-dia
cores using fuel and blanket salts No. 2 and U?33
and U?33 fuel, respectively, are compared. With
U235, a maximum regeneration of about 0.65 is
obtained at an inventory of about 400 kg. The
same amount of U233 gives a regeneration ratio of
1.0, and 1000 kg of U?33 gives a regeneration of
1.07.

in respect to regeneration ratio, but it is capable
of matching or exceeding the other systems in
specific power, as indicated in Table 5. However,
it should be noted that the U233 produced in the
MSR is recycled, whereas the plutonium produced
by the other systems listed is not recycled. The
economics of those systems depends strongly on
the market value of Pu?3?, and this isotope is
inferior as a fuel relative to U233. Thus a re-
generation of 0.5 for U233 (at $15 a gram) is
equivalent to a regeneration 0.62 for plutonium (at
$12 a gram). It is concluded that the molten-salt-
fueled system is competitive with solid-fuel con-
verter reactors burning U23% in respect to specific
power and fuel regeneration. The choice between
the two systems therefore lies in other factors,
such as reliability, maintainability, and cost of
fuel reprocessing.
