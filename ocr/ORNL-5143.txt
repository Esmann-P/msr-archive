ABSTRACT

A mechanically agitated, nondispersing contactor in
which molten fluoride salt and molten bismuth phases were
contacted has been built and operated. The mass transfer
performance of the contactor was evaluated over a range of
agitator speeds under conditions in which the major resist-
ance to mass transfer was in the salt phase. The measured
mass transfer rates were compared with rates predicted by
literature correlations. The equipment necessary to contain
the salt and bismuth at ~ 600°C is described along with the
complete set of experimental data obtained during operation.

1. INTRODUCTION

A molten-salt breeder reactor (MSBR) will be fueled with a molten
fluoride mixture that will circulate continuously through the blanket
and core regions of the reactor and through the primary heat exchanger.
Methods are being developed for use in a close-coupled processing facility
for removing fission products, corrosion products, and fissile materials

from the molten fluoride mixture.

The proposed MSBR processing plant is based on fluorination to
remove uranium, reductive extraction to remove protactinium, and the
metal transfer process to remove the rare-earth fission products. The
type of two-phase contactor being considered for the latter two steps in
the processing plant is a nondispersing, mechanically agitated contactor
in which a molten-salt phase and molten-bismuth phase are contacted to

effect the desired separation.
A facility was installed for measuring mass transfer rates across a
salt-metal interface in a mechanically agitated, nondispersing contactor
using a molten mixture of LiF-BeF,-ThF) (72-16-12 mole %) as the light
phase, and molten bismuth as the heavy phase, Mass transfer rates for
e37y and My tracers were measured at nine different agitator speeds.
The purpose of the experiments was to provide measurements of mass trans-
fer coefficients in a fluoride salt-bismuth system with which existing
correlations could be compared, and to provide data for developing new
correlations for mass transfer coefficients which would allow large-

scale contactors to be designed.

Included in this report is a complete description of the experimental
equipment, operating procedures, experimental data, and interpretation of
the results.

2. EXPERIMENTAL EQUIPMENT

Mass transfer rates between molten salt and bismuth in the mechani-
cally agitated contactor were measured in steady-state experiments in
which salt and bismuth streams flowed through the contactor. Concentra-
tions of components which transferred between phases were measured in
inlet and effluent streams. The equipment used to make these measure-
ments consisted of the contactor vessel; feed and catch tanks for salt
and bismuth; a vessel for purification of the salt and bismuth inventory;
provisions for withdrawing samples of each phase from various locations;
freeze valves for salt and bismuth flow control; instrumentation for
temperature, pressure, and gas flow measurement and control; and gas
supplies and purification systems. A description of the equipment
follows.

2.1 Flow Diagram of Salt-Bismuth System

A flow diagram of the system for flowing salt and bismuth streams
through the contactor is shown in Fig. 1. Salt and bismuth were metered
from the salt feed tank and the bismuth feed tenk (vessels T-1 and T-3,
respectively) by controlled pressurization of these tanks. The salt and

bismuth flowed to the contactor vessel; each phase entered below the
surface of the contactor inventory of that phase and left the contactor
through an effluent line at the salt-bismuth interface elevation. The
interface thus was continuously renewed and mass-transfer inhibiting
films were removed. The combined effluent stream was separated, and
each stream flowed through a flowing stream sampler and then to the
salt and bismuth catch tanks (vessels T-2 and T-4, respectively). The
feed and catch tanks for each phase were concentric tanks to conserve
space in the hood (see Sect. 2.3), The salt and bismuth inventory
could be sent to a graphite-lined treatment vessel (vessel T-5) for
periodic treatment with Ho -HF mixtures for removal of impurities and

adjustment of distribution coefficients.

2.2 Contactor Vessel

A diagram of the contactor is shown in Fig. 2. The contactor was
a 6-in. (152-mm)-diam low-carbon steel vessel containing four 1-in.
(25-mm)-wide vertical baffles. The agitator consisted of two 2-7/8-in.
(73-mm)-diam turbines with four 3/L-in. (19-mm)-wide straight blades.
A 3/Lk-in. (19-mm)-diam overflow at the interface allowed the removal of
interfacial films with the salt and metal effluent streams. Salt and
bismuth were fed to the contactor below the surface of the respective

phase.

2.3 Feed and Catch Tanks for Salt and Bismuth

The duplex feéd and catch tanks for salt and bismuth were identical
in construction. The feed tank, an inner cylinder of 8-in. sched 80
pipe, was designed to operate at pressures up to 50 psig (345 kPa) at
600°C, Both the inner feed tank and the outer catch tank had a capacity
of about 20 liters of fluid; however, only about 15 liters of salt and

15 liters of bismuth were used.

The top of each feed tank contained seven ports: (1) an inlet
port (1/2-in. pipe with a fitting for 3/8-in. tubing), which did not
extend into the tank; (2) an outlet line (1/2-in. pipe with a fitting
for 3/8-in. tubing), which extended to within 1/2 in. (13 mm) of the

port; and (7) a 1/2-in. capped pipe as a spare port. Bach catch tank
had the same ports as the feed tanks except that no addition port was
provided. The outer surfaces of the feed and catch tanks were flame

sprayed with nickel aluminide to retard oxidation.

2.4 Treatment Vessel for Salt and Metal

The treatment vessel consisted of a 304L stainless steel pressure
vessel that held a graphite crucible. The cylindrical portion of the
pressure vessel was 26.5 in. (0.67 m) long [1/h-in, (6.4%-mm) wall thick-
ness] by 18 in. (0.46 m) OD and with 18-in. (0.46-m)-0D by 1/L-in.
(6.4-mm)-thick dished heads on each end. It was designed to withstand
H -1F at 600°C at a pressure of 50 psig (345 kPa).

The inner crucible, machined of graphite, ® had an outer diameter
of 16.75 in. (0.43 m) and was an overall 26.75 in. (0.68 m) high. The
wall thickness tapered from 1.75 in. (44 mm) at the bottom te 0.75 in.
(19 mm) at a point 16.75 in. (0.43 m) from the bottom, and was uniform
from there to the top. The bottom of the crucible was 1.75 in. (44 mm)
thick. The crucible had a 16.75-in. (0.43 m)-diam 1id, whose thickness
varied from 1 in. (25 mm) at the rim to 0.5 in. (13 mm) at the center.
The graphite crucible rested on a support plate inside the pressure
vessel, and the 1id was held loosely in position by three studs pro-
Jecting from inside the top of the pressure vessel, The vessel had 13

nozzles, which are described in Table 1.

2.5 Samplers

The treatment vessel and the feed and catch tanks were each pro-
vided with a 1/2-in. sched LO pipe nozzle fitted with a ball valve and
sample port. These tank sample ports held four sample capsules attached
to capillary tubing that extended through a Teflon plug in the top.
These capsules were lowered (while the system was under argon pressure)
through the ball valve into the tank below, and samples were drawn into

the capsules by vacuum.

In addition to the five sample ports on the vessels, there were two
flowing-stream sample ports that operated in a manner similar to that of
the tank sample ports. These flowing-stream sample ports allowed seven
samples to be taken from each of two flowing streams during operation.
One sample port was located on the salt return line (between the con-
tactor and the salt catch tank), and one was located on the metal return

line (between the contactor and the metal catch tank).

The filtered sample capsules, which were used to take bismuth and
salt samples, were made from 1/4-in. (6.lL-mm)-diam stainless steel rod
that was 3/k in. (19 mm) long. The sample capsules were fitted with a
porous 347 stainless steel filter on one end and 1/16-in. (1.6-mm)-diem
capillary tubing on the other. Figure 3 shows a schematic diagram of a
sample capsule and a typical tank sample port.

2.6 Freeze Valves and Lines

Salt and metal flows through the facility were directed by four
freeze valves in the transfer lines, located as indicated in Fig. 1.
These valves were simply dips (in the carbon steel tubing) that were
fitted with air cooling lines. Those freeze valves that had to be closed
before any salt or metal could be transferred from the treatment vessel
were equipped with small reservoirs (sbout 50 em) upstream and down-
stream from the valve. The facility, which was of welded construction,
contained approximately 200 £1 (61 m) of salt and metal transfer lines

(3/8- and 1/2-in. pressure tubing).

2.7 Instrumentation and Control

The principal objective of the instrumentation and control system
was to provide closely regulated flows of bismuth and molten salt to the
contactor. The range of flow rates for both bismuth and molten salt was
nominally LO to 500 cc/min, corresponding to experiment durations of
about 5 to 0.5 hr. Pressures and liquid levels in the five vessels
(treatment vessel and feed and catch tanks) of the facility were sensed
by Foxboro differential-pressure transmitters, which sent signals to
miniature pneumatic recorders or controllers. Liquid level was inferred
from the pressure of the argon that was supplied to a dip-leg bubbler in
each tank, Flow rates of bismuth and salt to the contactor were con-
trolled by regulating the rate of change of liquid level in the two feed
tanks. The feed and catch tanks, the treatment vessel, and the contactor
were maintained at the desired temperatures by automatic controllers;
transfer-line temperatures and temperatures of small components were
controlled by manually regulating the appropriate voltage transformers

that supplied power to Calrod tubular heaters.

Figure 4 is a schematic diagram of the control system that regulated
the flow of bismuth or salt to the contactor. It was designed to circum-
vent the flow-control problems that sometimes occur when gas pressure is
used to maintain a constant flow of liquid from a heated feed tank. An
adjustable ramp generator and an electric-to-pneumatic converter were
used to linearly decrease the set point of a controller that sensed
liquid level in the feed tank. The level was controlled by controlling
the flow rate of argon to the gas space of the feed tank. The result
was & uniformly decreasing liquid level and, hence, a uniform discharge
rate of bismuth or salt from the tank. This control system was unaffected
by small increases in back pressure, partial plugging of transfer lines,
decreasing feed tank level, etc., or leakage of argon (a small argon
bleed was provided to improve pressure control). Small gas pressure:
oscillations caused by temperature cycling was minimized by using time-
proportioning controllers. Rates of transfer of salt and metal between
the collection tanks and the treatment vessel were not required to be

closely regulated; therefore, manual control of pressurization was used.

Heating circuits were controlled manually for 11 transfer lines and
the two flowing stream samplers. On the transfer lines, the Calrods
rated at 230 V were operated at 140 V or less, and provided up to 185 W
per foot (600 W/m) of line. Typically, temperatures at three points on
each line were recorded. The temperature of approximately 100 points

was recorded for the system.

2.8 Gas Purification and Supply Systems

Three gases were required for the experimental facility: anhydrous
hydrogen fluoride (HF), hydrogen, and argon. Because of the highly
deleterious effect of small amounts of oxygen or water vapor, the nomi-
nally pure bottled hydrogen and argon were further purified to remove
traces of oxygen or water vapor. The anhydrous hydrogen fluoride that
was used only in the treatment vessel for hydrofluorination of the metal
and the salt was given no additional purification. A schematic diagram

for each of the three supply systems is shown in Fig. 5.

Highly purified argon was used for all applications requiring an
inert gas (e.g., pressurization of tanks for transferring bismuth and
molten salt, dip-leg bubblers for liguid-level measurements, and purging
of apparatus for sampling bismuth and salt). Cylinder argon with a
minimum purity of 99.995% was first fed to a bed of molecular sieves
(Fig. 5a), which reduced the water vapor content to about 2 ppm [-100°F
(-73°C) dew point]. The argon then flowed through a bed of uranium
metal turnings where the remaining oxygen and water vapor were removed.
A porous stainless steel filter removed any uranium oxide dust that
might have been carried from the uranium bed by the gas stream. The
maximum argon flow rate, based on the capacity of the molecular sieve
bed, was about 6 scfm (2.8 x 1073 std n3/sec).

The hydrogen purification system was a commercially available deviece®

that purified hydrogen by the selective diffusion of hydrogen across a

palladium alloy barrier. Impurities, along with a small flow of hydro-
gen, were bled continuously from the upstream side of the barrier. The
capacity of the unit was 15 scfh (1.2 x 107% sta m/sec). Controls for

the purifier were self-contained.

The anhydrous HF supply system utilized small capillaries for
metering; a pneumatic controller maintained a specified pressure drop
across a capillary by controlling the HF gas supply pressure. This was
achieved by regulating the temperature of the water bath in which the HF
supply tank was suspended (Fig. 5¢). Accidental overheating of the HF
supply tank was prevented by a switch that released cold water into the
bath if the temperature exceeded 60°C, The minimum flow range for the
HF supply was nominally O to 0.25 1b of HF per hour (0 to 0.15 g/sec);
the maximum range was O to 6 lb/hr (0 to 3.7 g/sec).

3. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

In order to measure mass transfer rates in the equipment previously
described, it was necessary to perform several operations. The proper
distribution coefficient of the transferring materials was adjusted by
adding reductant thorium and lithium to the bismuth. Tracers (2310 and
9772) were prepared by irradiating 23°U and %7r in the Oak Ridse
Research Reactor (ORR) and these were added to the salt feed before
each run. The salt and bismuth were fed through the contactor. Samples
were taken of salt and bismuth and were prepared for analysis. The salt
and metal phases were treated periodically with mixtures of hydrogen and

HF. Details of these procedures are described in this section.

3.1 Reductant Addition

Periodic adjustment of the reductant inventory in the bismuth phase
was necessary in order to replenish reductant loss due to oxidation,
since even the high-purity argon which was used as a cover gas still
contained a small amount of oxygen. The reductant inventory in the

bismuth also required adjustment after H, -HF treatment of the salt and

2
bismuth. The method used for adjusting the reductant inventory was
15

electrolytic dissolution of beryllium ions in the salt phase while the

salt and bismuth were in contact in the treatment vessel.

A schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus used for electro-
lytic beryllium addition is shown in Fig. 6. A 3/8-in. (8.2-mm) diam by
f-in., (152-mm) long beryllium rod was suspended in the treatment vessel
and immersed in the salt phase. The beryllium rod was connected electri-
cally to the positive terminal of a 12-V lead-acid storage battery via
wire and a stainless steel rod, which is insulated electrically from the
treatment vessel. To complete the circuit, the negative pole of the
battery was connected to an ammeter, a variable resistance, and finally
to the treatment vessel. The bismuth phase served as the cathode in

this electrolysis.

The overall reaction that takes place in this electrolytic cell
when current is passed between the beryllium anode and bismuth cathode

is:

3

3
= Oo
> Be® + U

+ +

Fa(salt) - Be” F, (salt) + U° (bismuth) . (1)
Thus, the electrolysis resulted in the oxidation of beryllium at the anode
(the beryllium rod) and the reduction of uranium at the cathode (the
bismuth surface). The reduced uranium dissolved in the bismuth snd the
concentrations of thorium and lithium dissolved in the bismuth adjusted

to satisfy the equilibrium conditions that were reported previously.”

3.2 Tracer Irradiation and Addition

Mass transfer rates between the salt and bismuth phases were

23Ty and of My tracers that

determined from the extent of transfer of
were dissolved in the salt phase prior to an experiment. The salt and
bismuth were at chemical equilibrium with respect to the nonradioactive
uranium and zirconium.

The 27

Zr tracer was prepared by irradiating a T7.5-mg quantity of
9
9x0, enclosed in a quartz ampul in the ORR for 2L hr. The Mzro,

was then transferred to a 0.75-in. (19-mm)-diam steel capsule after an

18-hr decay period (for decay of 31

81 activity from the ampul) to
facilitate addition of the tracer to the salt phase. The capsule was
then immersed in the salt phase in the salt feed tank while argon was
sparged through the capsule to circulate salt through the capsule and
enhance mixing.

236

Uranium-237 tracer was prepared by irradiating v 1 mg U (as

23% 05) encased in a quartz ampul in the ORR for nv T2 hr. As with
the zirconium tracer, the uranium was then transferred to a steel addi-

tion capsule and loaded into the salt phase in the salt feed tank.

3.3 Run Procedure

All runs were performed using the same procedure. While the
fluoride salt and bismuth were in contact in the treatment vessel
(75), sufficient beryllium was added to the salt electrolytically to

produce the desired distribution coefficient (D).

Prior to a run, the salt and bismuth phases were separated by
pressurizing the salt-bismuth treatment vessel and transferring salt
and bismuth to their respective feed tanks. Approximately 7 mCi of
?Tzr-2Tib and 50 to 100 mei of 23TU04 were alloved to dissolve in the

salt phase about 2 hr prior to an experiment.

Salt and bismuth streams were passed through the contactor vessel
at the desired flow rates by controlled pressurization of the salt and
bismuth feed tanks. The contactor was maintained at 590 to 600°C for
211 runs. Both phases exited through a common effluent line, separated,

and returned to the salt and bismuth catch vessels.

3.4 Treatment with Hydrogen-Hydrogen Fluoride Mixture

Periodic treatment of the salt and bismuth phases with HF-E, mix-
tures was necessary to remove oxides from the salt, and dissolved
reductants and impurities (thorium, lithium, and iron) from the bismuth.
The treatment procedure also served to adjust the equilibrium distri-

bution of uranium and zirconium between the salt and bismuth phases.
18

The procedure followed was to sparge an HF-F, mixture into the salt
phase while both the salt and bismuth were in the treatment vessel (T5).
In order to prevent excessive attack on containers and piping, the
hydrogen fluoride concentration was kept below 30 mole % by dilution
with hydrogen, although an attempt was made to keep the HF concentration
as near 30% as possible to afford the maximum oxide removal rate. The
total nominal flow rate was 30 scfh. The hydrogen fluoride flow rate
was set by the pressure drop across a capillary, and the H, flow rate

2

was set by a rotameter which was calibrated with H From the treatment

0°

vessel, the HPF-H_, stream passed through a sodium fluoride bed (to remove

HF) and then vas exhausted to the atmosphere outside of Building 3592.

The feed and off-gas from the treatment vessel were analyzed by
diverting a small portion of the stream through a small agueous scrubber
and a 0.05 £t3/revolution (1.4 x 1073 m3 /revolution) wet-test meter,
which were connected in series. The concentration of HF in the gas
stream was determined by passing the gas through 250 ml of a 0.k N NaOH
solution in the scrubber. When 0.05 rt3 (1.4 x 1073 nd) of H, had
passed through the wet-test meter, the gas flow was stopped and the
solution was removed for analysis. The HF concentration in the gas was
determined by titrating small samples of the scrubbing solution with
0.1 N HCl. Utilization of the HF was calculated from the feed and

discharge concentrations.

3.5 Sample Preparation and Analysis

In an effort to avoid contamination of the samples obtained in each
run with extraneous material, the sample capsules were cleaned of foreign
material before analysis by the following procedure. Gross amounts of
salt or bismuth were first removed with a file, the sample capsule was
then polished with emery cloth, and, finally, the capsule was washed

with acetone.

The samples were analyzed by first counting the sample capsules for
the activity of 231U (207.95 keV B~) and the activity of ° Zr- Nb
(743.37 keV and 658.18 keV B , respectively) after secular equilibrium
was reached between Mgr and its daughter 9M. The material in the
19

23Ty was counted

sample capsules was then dissolved, and the activity of
again after the My 9Tp activity had decayed to a very low level. This
was done to correct for self-absorption in the solid samples. Mass

transfer rates were than calculated from the ratios of tracer concentrations

as discussed in Appendix B.
4, EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Nine runs weve made in the experimental equipment to measure rates of
mass transfer of 23Ty and Mgr between salt and bismuth. In these runs,
the agitator speed was varied over the range of 68 to 2kL rpm, and the
operating temperature was held in the range of 590 to 600°C. Concentra-

231 rere measured {as described in Sect. 3.5) in the

tions of Igy and
salt input and both the salt and bismuth effluent streams. The counting
data obtained in all runs are given in Appendix A. Using these concen-
trations, three different equations were used to calculate the mass
transfer coefficient between the salt and bismuth in the contactor.

The derived equations are given in Appendix B. The calculated mass
transfer coefficients for all the runs are summarized in Table 2. The
values given in Table 2 are the average of the values calculated from the
three equations [Eqs. (B-18)-(-20)] with the standard deviation. Values

are given both for results based upon the uranium counting and for resulis

based upon the zirconium counting.

Run TSMC-1 was mainly a preliminary run designed to test the procedure.
Salt and bismuth flows were approximately 200 ce/min, and the stirrer rate
was 123 rpm. Unfortunately, the distribution coefficient (defined in
Appendix B) was too low to effect any significant mass transfer, and mass
transfer rates could not be determined accurately; thus, no results are

shown for this run in Table 2.

Operation of the equipment during rum TSMC-2 was very smooth. The
salt and bismuth flow rates were 228 and 197 ce/min, respectively. The
distribution coefficients were higher than for the previous run, but were
lower than desired, resulting in much uncertainty. Several determinations
of the distribution coefficient of uranium D_ were made that ranged from

U
0.94 to 34. One determination was made of the distribution coefficient

of zirconium D, that indicated Dg. was 0.96. Consequently, only a range
of possible values for the overall mass transfer coefficient could be
stated for the results based on uranium. A value for overall mass transfer
coefficient based on zirconium is given, but since the value for D,. is
uncertain, there is more uncertainty in the mass transfer coefficient

than is indicated by the reported standard deviation given in Table 2.

A bismuth line leak occurred immediately preceeding run TSMC-3.
During the resulting delay for repairs, the My decayed and only the
23Ty tracer could be used. The remainder of the run went smoothly. Salt
and bismuth flow rates were 166 and 173 cc/min, and the stirrer rate was
162 rpm. A high value for Dy (greater than 3!) was maintained for this

run.

In run TSMC-L, flow rates of 170 and 14b cc/min were set for the
salt and bismuth flows, and a stirrer rate of 205 rpm was maintained.
The distribution coefficients, which had been determined from samples
taken before, after, and during the run, were greater than 172 for D

U

and greater than 2L for D These values are sufficiently large so that

Zr’
Eqs. (B-18)-(-20) in Appendix B are valid. Large distribution coefficients
cannot be determined precisely due to the inability to determine very
small amounts of uranium in the salt phase. No problems arose during

this run.

Runs TSMC-5 and -6 were performed without incident. The distribution
coefficients were maintained at high levels for both runs. TSMC-5 had a
stirrer rate of 120 rpm and salt and bismuth flows of 219 and 175 cc/min.
TSMC-6 salt and bismuth flows were 206 and 185 ce/min, respectively, with

a stirrer rate of 180 rpm.

Prior to rum TSMC-T, two leaks developed in the bismuth transfer line
from the bismuth feed tank to the contactor vessel. This transfer line
was completely replaced along with the associated Calrod and thermal
insulation. The volumetric flow rates of salt and bismuth during the
run were 152 em /min and 170 cm3/min, respectively. The stirrer rate was
set at 68 rpm for the run. The uranium distribution coefficient was
greater than 97. Seven sets of salt and bismuth flowing stream samples

were taken from the contactor effluent during the run.
22

Run TSMC-8 was performed with salt and bismuth flow rates of 152 cc/
min and 164 cc/min, respectively. The uranium distribution coefficient
was maintained at a level (> 40) for this run which was greater than the
minimum desired value of 20. It was presumed that the agitator operated
at 241 rpm, which is high enough to produce mild dispersion of the phases
in the contactor and, therefore, a high measured mass transfer rate.
However, results from this run indicated that very little (Vv 25%) of the
23Ty tracer was actually transferred from the salt to the bismuth.
Inspection of the magnetically coupled, agitator drive assembly indicated
that an accumulation of a highly viscous carbonaceous material between
the upper carbon bearing and the agitator drive shaft had prevented
proper rotation of the shaft. The drive assembly was cleaned of all foreign

material, was reassembled, and was found to operate satisfactorily.

The ninth tracer run, TSMC-9, was performed as a repeat of the eighth
run. Salt and bismuth flow rates were set at 169 cc/min and 164 ce/min,
respectively. The agitator was operated at 2L4 rpm during this run. A
high stirrer rate was maintained to determine the effects on the mass
transfer rate of dispersal of one phase in the other, and to determine
if large amounts of bismuth and salt are entrained in the other phase
after settling in the contactor effluent line. Entrainment results from
this run and another similar run are given in Appendix D. The uranium
distribution coefficient was greater than 47 during this run. No

systematic problems were encountered and the run was performed smoothly.

5. IRTERPRETATION OF RESULTS

In this section, the mass transfer coefficients measured in the salt-
bismuth system are compared with typical mass transfer coefficients
measured in aqueous-organic systems at comparable agitator diameters and
speeds and with mass transfer coefficients measured in a water-mercury
system. The mass transfer coefficients measured in this study are also
compared to predictions made by three mass transfer correlations taken
from the literature that were developed from data measured in aqueous-

organic systems.

The mass transfer coefficients for 3Ty are compared in Fig. 7 with

some typical mass transfer coefficients measured in agueous-organic systems
and with water-side mass transfer coefficients measured in a water-mercury

system."

The figure shows that the mass transfer coefficients measured
in the salt-bismuth system (curve A) are quite high compared to the agueous—
organic and water-mercury results measured in cells of comparable size

and at comparable agitator speeds (curves B through E). Except for curve
BE all the mass transfer coefficient data can be divided into two regimes:
(1) at low agitator speeds the mass transfer coefficient is proportional

to the agitator speed raised to a power less than 1.0 (0.9 for the salt-
bismuth results and 0.7 for results represented by curves B through E);

and (2) at higher agitator speeds the mass transfer coefficient is pro-
portional to the agitator speed raised to a power significantly greater
than 1.0 (1.5 for curve D, 1.95 for curves B and C, and 9.0 for curve A).
Olander and Benedict® suggest that the sudden change in exponent for their
deta (in the absence of phase dispersal) is caused by a laminar-turbulent
transition at the interface. Observation has shown that phase dispersal
did not occur at the break points of curves B, C, and D, but it was not
possible to determine unequivocally when dispersal occurred in the salt-
bismuth system since measurements of entrainment were inconclusive on

this point (see Appendix D). However, previous work? *0 with water-mercury
and with aqueous-organic systems indicates that, for the agitator diameter
used, dispersal of molten salt into bismuth should begin to occur at an
agitator speed of about 170 rpm. This entrainment would cause the apparent
mass transfer coefficient to be greater than the mass transfer coefficient
that would have resulted if phase dispersal had not occurred. The increase
would be due to the increased area for mass transfer, since the apparent
masg transfer coefficient is based upon the area of the undisturbed inter-

face. Since dispersal was expected, and because the dependence on agitator
2h

speed 1s so different from the aqueous-organic data and the water-mercury
data, it is concluded that dispersal of salt into bismuth occurred at an
agitator speed between 160 and 180 rpm, even though entrainment measure-
ments do not support this.

97

The mass transfer coefficients for Zr are shown in Fig. 8 compared
to curve A from Fig. 7. In all but two cases (runs TSMC-2 and -5), the
zirconium mass transfer coefficient was lower than the uranium mass trans-
fer coefficient. This difference is probably related to the inability to
correct for the self-absorption of the TU3.37 keV B~ in the analysis of
My in the solid bismuth samples. In run TSMC-2, all the resistance to
mass transfer of uranium was in the salt phase, whereas there was sig-
nificant resistance to mass transfer of zirconium in both phases. Never-
theless, the overall mass transfer coefficients for uranium and zirconium

were of comparable magnitude in this run.

The mass transfer coefficients were compared with three literature
correlations for mass transfer coefficient in stirred cells that were
developed for aqueous-organic systems. The properties of the fluoride
salt that were used to evaluate these correlations are given in Appendix
D. The properties of bismuth at 600°C that were used are:

Ng; = 1.0 x 107° g/cm-sec.

For Lewis' work, where the densities of the various phases varied from
0.8 to 1.2 g/cm but the stirrer length was kept constant, this correla-
tion effectively uses only the Reynolds number of the phase being con-

sidered.

The uranium mass transfer coefficients are compared to the Lewis
correlgtion in Fig. 9. At agitator speeds below 170 rpm, the lewis corre-
lation overpredicts the mass transfer coefficient for uranium; it also
shows a stronger dependence of mass transfer coefficient on the agitator
speed than the data indicate. No dependence of molecular diffusivity is
shown by this correlation. The omission of a term containing molecular
diffusivity from the correlation has been criticized in the recent liter-

8.9 9

ature. It has been shown theoretically and in recent experiments
that the mass transfer coefficient should be proportiongl to molecular

diffusivity raised to a power near 1/2.

This correlation, which is based oun data covering a limited range of den-
sities (0.8 to 1.2 g/cmd), indicates that the viscosity and density of

each phase affect the mass transfer coefficient.

A comparison of the uranium mass transfer coefficients with the Meyers
correlation is shown in Fig. 10. At agitator speeds below 170 rpm, the
Mayers correlation also overpredicts the mass transfer coefficient, but
the predicted dependence of mass transfer coefficient on agitator speed
is more nearly in accord with the date than it is in the Lewis correlation.
Note that the dependence on the Schmidt number (molecular diffusivity) is

fairly weak.

McManamey correlated his data and the results obtained by Lewis
by using the following expression, which is similar to that used by lewis

but includes the Schmidt number:

The uranium mass transfer coefficients are compared with the McManamey
correlation in Fig. 11. This correlation shows good agreement with the
data at agitator speeds below 170 rpm. It must be pointed out, however,
that the Schmidt number for diffusion of uranium in molten fluoride salt
was estimated by using correlations based upon materials with solution

behavior that is quite different from molten salt solutions. Hence, the

very good agreement shown here should be considered somewhat coincidental.
6. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The following conclusions and recommendations are based upon the

experimental results and analysis presented in this report.

(1) At comparable agitator speeds, salt-side mass transfer coeffi-
cients for uranium are higher than water-side mass transfer
coefficients for quinone measured in water-mercury systems,
and higher than mass transfer coefficients for other components
in aqueous-organic systems. Furthermore, the dependence of
salt-side mass transfer coefficients on agitator speed seems
to be somewhat stronger than for the water-mercury system at

low agitator speeds and with similar diameter agitators.

(2) The change in slope of the mass transfer coefficient vs agitator
— curve at 170 rpm is probably caused by the onset of phase
dispersal. The occurrence of dispersal at this speed is in
reasonable agreement with date measured in water-mercury and

aqueous-organic systems.

(3) There is a large increase in mass transfer rates with only
slight phase dispersal. Tt may be possible to achieve mass
transfer rates required in the MSBER processing plant by
operating under these conditions without suffering bismuth
entrainment in the salt. The data on bismuth entrainment
presented in the Appendix suggest this, but further testing

is required to confirm it.

The mass transfer coefficients measured at agitator speeds
below 170 rpm provide data which should be compared with new
correlations for stirred nondispersing contactors. The
McManamey correlation correlated these data much beter than
two other literature correlations; however, it should be used
with extreme caution for scaleup and design if extrapolations

to untested conditions are required.

APPENDIX B.

Calculation of Mass Transfer Coefficients

For a flow-through, continuously stirred contactor at steady-state

conditions, a mass balance on the salt phase yields:

FC) = FC +d, (B-1)
where

F, = flow rate of salt, en3/zec,

Cy = tracer concentration in salt inflow, units/em>,

Cy = tracer concentration in salt outflow, units/cm,

J = rate of transfer of tracer across the interface, units/sec.

Expressing the rate of transfer across the interface as the product
of an overall mass transfer coefficient and a driving force times the

area available for mass transfer yields: 12

The above equations can then be used to calculate mass transfer
coefficients from experimental results (i.e., the ratio of tracer

concentration in any two of the salt of bismuth flows).

Within experimental error, the distribution coefficient D can be set
as desired. To minimize effects of uncertainties in the value of D on
the calculated value of the overall mass transfer coefficient, D should
be made fairly large. For the values of concentrations and flow rates
used in these experiments, the terms which contain D in Egs. (B-15},
(B-16}, and (B-17) are less than 5% of the values of the other terms
for values of D greater than 20 and can be neglected with 1ittle error.
By assuming that the terms that contain D can be neglected, Eqs. (B-15),
(B-16), and (B-1T) reduce to

 

kK, = (B~18)
Kk = (B-19)

Uncertainties in the distribution coefficient do not affect the
accuracy of the overall mass transfer coefficient. However, as shown
by Eq. (14), when D is very large, the overall mass transfer coefficient
is essentially the individual salt-phase coefficient, since resistance

to mass transfer in the metal phase 1s comparatively negligible.

Calculation of Diffusivity of UF, and ZrF), in Molten Salt

The diffusivities of ur, and ZrF), in molten salt (72-16-12 mole %)

LiF-BeF ~ThF) were estimated from an empirical equation developed by

Wilke, 13 which was based on the Stokes-Einstein equation: '

where
B. = diffusion coefficient of specie A in solvent B, cme /see,
ty = assoclation parameter for solvent B, which is equel to 1.0
for an unassociated liquid,
T = temperature, °K,
Mz = molecular weight of solvent B, g/e-mole,
Vy = molar volume of solute A, em3/g-mole,

n solution viscosity, cP.

This equation is good only for dilute solutions of nondigsociating solutes;

for such solutions the error is within + 10% of the true value. 1

The diffusivity of UF, and ZrF) in molten LiF-BeF,-ThF), (72-16-12

Entrainment Studies

One hydrodynamic test was performed to determine the amount of fluo-
ride salt that might be dispersed and entrained in the bismuth and the
amount of bismuth that might be dispersed and entrained in the fluoride
salt effluent streams of the contactor at various agitator speeds. This
hydrodynamic run was performed with salt and bismuth flow rates of 150
ce/min and 1L0 ce/min, respectively. The agitator was operated at three
different speeds during the run, 250 rpm, 310 rpm, and 386 rpm. At 250
rpm and 310 rpm three sets of unfiltered salt and bismuth samples from
the contactor effluent streams were taken at L-min intervals. Three
sets of unfiltered effluent samples were also taken with the agitator
operating at 386 rpm, but the samples were teken at 2-min intervals. The
sample capsules were cleaned and the contents of each sample were removed
as described in Sect. 3.5 of this report. The contents of each sample
were inspected for evidence of gross entrainment of one Phase inte the
other. No such evidence of entrainment was found. Results of chemical
analysis of the bismuth and salt samples for beryllium and bismuth con-

tent, respectively, are given in Table D-1.

The flowing-stream bismuth samples from runs TSMC-5, -6, and -9 were
also analyzed for beryllium content, and the results of these analyses
are given in Table D-2. Runs TSMC~5, -6, and -9 were performed with agi-

tator speeds of 124 rpm, 180 rpm, and 244 rpm, respectively.

The bismuth concentration measured in the salt samples taken during
the hydrodynamic run (Teble D-1) shows a general decrease with increasing
stirrer speed, with very low values occurring at the highest stirrer speed.
It also seems evident that the bismuth concentration in the salt phase may
have been a function of the run time. After the fourth sample, the bis-
muth concentration in the salt samples reamined at a relatively constant
value of 50 + 11 ppm; this is quite different from the values reported

for the first four samples,which ranged from 1800 ppm to 155 ppm.

These results are significantly higher than those of Lindauer’ who
saw less than 10 ppm of bismuth in fluoride salt that was in contact with
bismuth in several different contacting devices. It is likely that sample
contamination is a contributing factor to the high bismuth concentrations
that were measured. Three possible sources of sample contamination have

been reported: ?

(1) sample contamination during sampling by withdrawing the samples

through a sample port that has been in contact with bismuth;

(2) sample contamination during sample handling and in the analytical
laboratory by the use of equipment that is used routinely for

bismuth analyses;

(3) sample contamination from a low-density bismuth material that

may be floating on the salt surface.

The beryllium concentration in the bismuth samples taken in the hydro-
dynamic run (Table D-1) and in runs TSMC-5, -6, and -9 (Table D-2) show
both high and low values with no discernible dependence on agitator speed.
Based on previous experiments with water-mercury and organic-mercury systems,
one would expect entrainment of the light phase into the heavy phase at

an agitator speed of about 170 rpm.
