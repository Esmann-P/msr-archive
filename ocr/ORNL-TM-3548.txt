ABSTRACT

An evaluation has been made of the long-term hazards of
"high-level" and "alpha" radioactive wastes generated by irra-
diation of three fuels representative of those which will be
used to generate electrical powér in the next several decades.
In this evaluation the composition and radioactivity of the
wastes generated by typical LWR, IMFBR, and molten-salt breeder
reactors utilizing the enriched uranium, Pu-228U, and 233U-Th
fuel cycles, respectively, have been computed for times up to
30 million years after discharge.

~The volumes of water necessary to dilute the various types of
high-level waste to the radiation concentration guides (RCG) for

- ingestion in unrestricted areas have been computed as a function
of age of the waste. It was found that the volumes required to
dilute the three types of waste were similar when evaluated at
the same age and exposure. The volume of water necessary to
dilute any of the three wastes aged 1000 years and the associated
salt in the proposed Federal Repository to the RCG for unrestricted
uses 1s less than that required to dilute the same amount of uranium
ore tailings to the RCG. The high-level waste deposited in the
Federal Repository will result in an alpha activity of less than
10 uCi/kg at 10,000 years after burial when averaged over the total
mass of the Repository.

The hazard of a number of types of waste contaminated to
10 pCi/kg (the upper limit assumed for surface burial) of initial
parent alpha activity was also calculated as a function of time, -
and the time of maximum relative hazard was determined, Trans-
uranium or alpha wastes contaminated to this level will present a
maximum ingestion hazard similar to naturally occurring uranium
ores.

 

1. INTRODUCTION

‘High-level and alpha wastes generated in nuclear fuel cycles for .
production of electrical power will contain. isotopes which remain radio-
active for millions of years. The "high-level" wastes are principally
the fission-product concentrates that arise from the recovery of fissile

and fertile materials from spent fuel. Typically, however, these wastes
contain a variety of actinides that are made from transmutation of fuel
material and, in addition, quantities of uranium, thorium, and plutonium
that are not economically recoverable for recycle. "Alpha" wastes —
materials contaminated with substantial concentrations of long-lived
alpha emitters — are produced primarily in plants for preparation of

nuclear fuel materials.

Sighificant variations will occur in the compositions of the wastes
generated by various reactor concepts because of differences between types
of fuel, neutron energy spectra and flux level, and length of irradiation,
as well as efficiency of utilization of fuel. Calculations have been made,
as a function of decay time, of the compositions and radiocactivities of
the wastes generated by typical light water reactors {LWRs), liquid
metal cooled fast breeder reactors (IMFBRs), and moltenw-salt breeder reactors
(MSBRs), which are representative of enriched 235U, 239py, and 333U fuels.
These radioactivities have been used,along with the radiation concentration
guides for ingestion in unrestricted areas given in the Code of Federal
Regulations (10 CFR 20), to evaluate the relative hazard of the wastes.
~ The compositions of 460 fission products and 80 actinide elements and
their decay products were included in the calculations, which were per-

1,2

formed with the ORIGEN isotope generation and decay code.

2. REACTOR OPERATING CONDITIONS AND HIGH -LEVEL -WASTE
oC RADIONUCLIDE INVENTORIES
The quantities present at time of processing in wastes resulting

from 33,000 MWA of exposure in typical LWRs, LMFBRs,and MSBRs are given
in Table 1 for those nuclides found to be of importance in the evaluation
of the long-term safe disposal of radicactive wastes. The LWR considered
has been described in ref, 3. It is fueled with 3.3% enriched uranium
and is operated at an average specific power of 30 MW/metric ton of heavy
metal charged to the reactor to a burnup of 33,000 MWd/metric ton. The
fuel is assumed to be processed at 150 days after discharge, with removal

of 99.5% of the uranium and plutonium for recycle.

CReference MSBR equilibrium fuel cycle with continuous chemical processing by

The LMFBR considered was the Atomics International Reference Oxide
Design.” The mixed fuel discharged from the core and blankets of this
reactor has been irradiated to an average burnup of 33,000 MWd/metric ton
of heavy metal charged to the reactor at an average specific power of 58.2
MW/metric ton. The fuel is assumed to be processed at 30 days after dis-

charge with a 99.5% recovery of uranium and plutonium,

The MSBR is a fluid fuel reactor that operates on the Th-233U fuel
eyele.® The present concept. employs fluorination-reductive extraction
of the fuel salt to isolate 223Pa outside the reactor core with a 10-day
removal time. This chemical processing step is also responsible for
removing plutonium and a number of fission products from the fuel salt
on a 10-day cycle. Strontium, barium, and the rare-earth fission products
are removed from the fuel salt by an extraction process called the metal
transfer process with removal times ranging from 16 to 51 days. In addi-
tion, salt containing thorium is discarded to waste on a 4200-day cycle.
This mode of operation, which results in thorium utilization of only oe
13.7%, makes fairly inefficient use of fertile material relative to the
LWR and IMFBR concepts. The reference MSER has a yield of 3.2% of the XK
reactor fissile inventory per year, and it was assumed that 1/2% of the
uranium removed from the reactor for sale was lost to waste. Also, high-
level wastes are removed from the system in batches every 220 days follow-
ing fluorination to recover uranium which might be present in the waste
streams. It was assumed that 1/2% of the uranium in the waste streams
was not recovered by the fluorination, and that all the 223Pa which
remained at the end of the 220 days was lost with the fission product

waste.

It should be noted that the LMFBR and MSBR are advanced concepts
with thermal efficiencies of LO to 45%, while typical PWRs achieve thermal
efficiencies of about 32%. ‘Consequently, an LWR generating the same
electrical energy as an LMFBR or an MSBR will produce 25 to 40% more
waste than that given in Table 1 or in subsequent tables since they are
all based on 33,000 MWA of heat production.
3. HAZARD AS A FUNCTION OF AGE OF HIGH-LEVEL WASTE

The composition, radioactivity, and hazard of the three types of
waste were computed. as a function of age for times up to 30 million
years. Tables 2-4 show the radioactivity of a number of isotopes of
special interest as a function of age. In these tables, the actinides
are grouped according to their decay chains, so that it is easier to
observe daughters building up and gradually reaching equilibrium as

~ their precursors decay.

Table 5 presents the values used for the RCG for the isotopes found

to be most important in determining the long-term hazard.

A measure of the ingestion hazard associated with a radionuclide
is the quantity of water required to dilute the nuclide to the .RCG for
unrestricted use of the water; the larger the amount of water required,
the greater the hazard. The volumes of water required for the three
types of wastes are shown in Table 6,and the isotope which is the
principal hazard at a given time is shown -in parentheses. The fission
product 9° Sr is the principal ingestion hazard for the first few hundred
years and the hazards are about the same for the three types of wastes.
In the first 30 to 300 years after disposal, the measure of hazard
associated with the wastes decreased from around 10%! cubic meters of
water to around 3 x 102 cubic meters, due primarily to the decay of
9 5pr, For the period 300 to 3000 years after disposal,the 233U fuel
waste is somewhat less hazardous than the others due to the absence of
transplutonium isotopes. The hazard associated with all the wastes
rises slightly at about a quarter of a million years after disposal,
which is due to peaking of the 226Ra activity. The hazard associated
with the 233U fuel wastes diminishes less quickly than the other wastes
due to the presence of the relatively large amount of 222Th, the parent
of the isotope 228Rg (which is the predominant hazard in this waste after

10°F years).

4, LONG-TERM RELATIVE HAZARD OF HIGH-LEVEL WASTE

The isotopes 22°Ra and 228Ra are the predominant alpha-emitting
radionuclides for ages greater than 100,000 years. These isotopes occur
in nature as daughters of 2380 and 222Th and,. if they are sufficiently
dilute in the waste, will present a hazard similar to those of naturally
occurring uranium.and thorium deposits. In the proposed Federal Reposi-
tory in bedded salt, the waste equivalent to 33,000 MWd of exposure may
be assumed to be associated with about 5500 metric tons of salt and 2400
tons of shale. This is based on the current design of the high-level
facility of the Repository, assuming that the accumulated waste from
3.2 x 10° MWd(t)" of exposure is dispersed in the 900-acre by 300-ft-
thick section of the bedded salt. Since the LWR or IMFBR waste from
33,000 MWd(t) of exposure will have a volume and a mass of about 3.3 ft3
and 140 kg, respectively, the salt bed serves to dilute the wastes by
approximately a factor of 37,000 in volume and 56,000 in weight. (The
dilution would not be as great for the present MSBR concept because of
the larger quantity of waste generated per 33,000 MWd of operation.)
This dilution results in an average 238U concentration in the bedded
layer of salt and shale of less than 1 ppm by weight for the 2357 and
239py wastes, and an average 232Th concentration of 30 ppm by weight for
the 2337 fuel wastes. The amount of ay which is present in the waste
initially, plus that which is produced by decay of 242Cm and 238py, is
well above that which would be in equilibrium with 1 ppm of naturally
occurring 238U, The quantities of 2347 which ultimately occur in the
wastes correspond to those which would be in equilibrium with 15, 5k,
and 680 wt ppm 238U in the bedded layer of salt and shale for the

wastes from 2357, 23°9Py, and 228y fuels, respectively.

The average concentrations of uranium and thorium in the earth's
crust are 6 and 12 ppm, respectively, and the volume of water required
to reduce the ingestion hazard of the corresponding mass of earth (7900

metric tons) containing these concentrations of uranium and thorium in

 

* .
The most recent forecast’ estimates that the high-level waste to be

accumulated in the Federal Repository, up to the time of closing in
year 2000, is 319,000 ft3,which is equivalent to a total exposure of
3.19 x 10° MWd(t). Most of this waste will be from LWRs since most of
the IMFBR waste will not yet have been delivered to the Repository.
12

equilibrium with their daughters is 1.07 x 10° m® (see Appendix). The
" hazard associated with the LWR type waste (the predominant type in the
Repository) is only a factor of four higher 10,000 years after disposal,
and the hazards from the other wastes are about an order of magnitude
higher, However , the hazard associated with the 233U fuel waste rises
again as the 228Ra concentration increases. The presence of 226Ra and
228Rg in high concentrations in the waste from the 223U-Th system is
‘the result of the absence of a step for recycling plutonium and the
assumed inefficient use of thorium in the present reprocessing schemes.
If the processing flowsheets are improved to eliminate these two
problems, the 233U fuel wastes would remain very similar to the 235U

and 23°Pu wastes at ages greater than 10,000 years.

Other thermal reactor concepts employing the Th-2337 fuel cycle are
the High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor (HTGR) and the Light Water Breeder
Reactor (LWBR). The wastes produced by these reactors would be similar
to MSBR wastes since the higher 0 Sr concentrations would be present
initially, since 238Pu will not be separated from the waste and recycled,
and because efficient recycle of the relatively inexpensive thorium is
not envisioned at present. Wastes from 238U fuels aged 30 years have a
thermal power 64% higher than 23°Pu wastes of the same burnup, and wastes
aged 100 years have a thermal power L6% greater. Since the peak tempera-
tures in the mine are reached at about 50 years after burial, the higher
heat generation rate from 233U fuel wastes will require a greater spacing
between waste cans, with a subsequent increase in cost. The burial cost

of the waste is a small fraction of the fuel cycle cost, however.

An alternative method of assessing the relative hazard of the radio-
active wastes is to compare them with naturally occurring radioactive
surface deposits. The southwestern United States has uranium ore reserves
containing 0.2% U30g4 or greater, totaling almost 50 million tons. In the
year 1968, domestic production of U,04 totaled over 12,000 tons, indicating
that some 6 million tons of such ore were processed and a corresponding
amount of uranium ore tailings was disposed of. The volume of water
required to dilute the radionuclides contained in- 7900 metric tons of

uranium ore tailings to the RCG for unrestricted use of the water is
13

2.0 x 108 m®, Consequently, the ingestion hazard associated with a’
quantity of uranium ore and uranium ore tailings equal to the amount

of salt and shale associated with 33,000 MWd of waste is greater than
that associated with any of the three high-level wastes aged 1000 years.

Another method of assessing the relative hazard of a radioactive waste
is to compare it with the hazard of naturally radioactive monazite sand.
Thorium and uranium are present in the mineral monazite which occurs in
beach sand in some areas of India, Brazil, Malaysia, and the southeastern
United States. Beach sands in Malagasy Republic average 2 to 2.5%
monazite, the monazite containing 8.8% Thos and 0.41% Us0g. Monazite .
sands found on the southeast coast of the United States average 3.1%

Tho, and 0.47% .U0,. To reduce the ingestion hazard from radioactivity

in these two sands for a mass equivalent to the waste and associated

salt in the proposed Federal Repository will require about 6 x 107 and

2 x 107 m® of water for the Malagasy and United States sands, respectively.
Hence, dissolving the buried 235U or 233U fuel wastes aged in the range

of 1000 to 3000 years, along with the associated salt, would present a
hazard similar to dissolving the radium from the same mass of monazite-
containing beach sand (noting, of course, that monazite sand is among

the least soluble of naturally occurring materials).

Another consideration with respect to the disposal of high-level
radioactive wastes in bedded salt is that to dissolve the waste for a
33,000 MWd exposure and associated salt to a potable concentration of
500 ppm NaCl by weight would require 1.1 x 10” m® of water. Thus, 235U
and 233U fuel wastes aged 3000 years, if diluted to drinking water coh-
centration in NaCl, would be below the radiation concentration guide for
ingestion by the general population. . Hence, if the salt mine is dissolved
some thousands of years in the future with sufficient water to dilute the
radionuclides to the RCG and the dissolved materials find their way to:
drinking water supplies, the water would be unacceptable as drinking

water because of its sodium chloride content.

5. .ISOTOPIC DILUTION OF HIGH-LEVEL WASTES

Tt has been suggested that a radioactive isotope may be disposed of
without further dilution provided that it is diluted to an acceptable
specific activity with an adequate quantity of the stable element in the
same chemical form and if the diluted material is also acceptable on the
basis of external hazard and chemical toxicity.” Consideration has been
given to this dilution method for reducing the ingestion hazard associated
with the high-level wastes. Table 7 lists the isotopes which present the
greatest hazard at a given age of the waste, their radiocactivities, and
the quantities of stable elements which would be required to dilute the
wastes below the maximum permissible specific activities given in ref. 9.
In ref. 9 it is assumed that the isotope 9° Sr must be diluted with stable
strontium, rather than another bone-seeking element (such as Ca), but
that the elements americium and plutonium may be diluted with rare earths.
Tt is also assumed that an "acceptably low" level of specific activity
is the value such that, if a person were to assimilate the element (or
chemically similar species) only from the source of interest, the body
burden of the radioisotope would not exceed the maximum permissible body
burden for occupational exposure. Using these assumptions it can be
calculated that 432 metric tons of stable strontium are required to dilute
the °° Sr in 100-year-old 235U waste resulting from 33,000 MWd of exposure
to an acceptably low specific activity. Since each. 33,000 MWA of waste
is associated with 8000 metric tons of salt and shale, a concentration
of 5% by weight stable strontium would be required throughout the salt
mine, which would be impractical. The concept may prove feasible for .
diluting waste aged 300 years, since only 3 metric tons of stable

strontium would be required for each 33,000 MWA exposure.

If it is assumed that the behavior of americium and plutonium in
the body is similar to that of rare earths, then 49 and 5.7 metric tons,
respectively, of rare-earth elements are required to be added to the
wastes to eliminate the ingestion hazards from 241Am and 239Py. Also,
if 250 g of stable iodine is added to each 33,000 MWA of waste, the

ingestion hazard from 12°I becomes acceptable for occupational exposure.

6. RELATIVE HAZARD OF TRANSURANIUM WASTES

For disposal in the Federal Repository, Godbee and Nichols'© have
proposed a lower limit for transuranium or "alpha" waste of 10 uCi/kg of
initial parent alpha activity. Alpha wastes (which mostly arise from
fuel fabrication) of lower activity are to be disposed of by surface
burial. To evaluate the hazards associated with surface burial of alpha
wastes,an investigation was made of the relative ingestion and inhalation
hazards of a number of isotopes and mixtures of isotopes expected to be
present. Table 8 compares the radioactive properties of uranium and
thorium in the average earth's crust, uranium ore, and uranium ore
tailings with those of a number of transuranium wastes contaminated to
an initial parent alpha activity of 10 uCi/kg. Shown in the table are
the properties at the time of isolation of the parents: and at the time
of maximum ingestion hazard. At the time of maximum hazard, the wastes
present an ingestion hazard similar to uranium ore tailings although
their total activities, thermal powers, and inhalation hazards are about
an order of magnitude greater than uranium ore tailings. The maximum
ingestion hazard resulting from an initial parent alpha activity of
10 nCi/kg of either natural uranium or natural thorium is larger by an
order of magnitude than any of the other wastes considered. For some
transuranium materials, 238Pu, 242Cm, and ®44Cm, the maximum ingestion
hazard is associated with the initial 10 uCi/kg of parent alpha activity.
The ingestion hazard associated with low-level plutonium wastes contami-
nated to a specific activity of 10 uCi/kg is appreciably less than that
associated with a kilogram of uranium ore tailings, and the ingestion
hazard associated with plutonium wastes 1s comparable to the maximum
hazard associated with other alpha wastes contaminated to the same
initial specific activity. The ingestion hazards for various wastes
are sufficiently similar that a criterion based on total alpha activity
alone, regardless of isotopic composition, may be sufficient for classi-

fying transuranium or alpha wastes.
