ABSTRACT

The use of nickel-molybdenum alloys as structural materials for high=-
temperature fused-salt reactor systems requires that they be readily
weldable. The welded joints must also possess adequate mechanical properties
at room and elevated temperatures. This paper describes the welding studies
conducted on a commercial alloy, Hastelloy B, and a developmental alloy
(now commercial), INOR-8. Hastelloy B is age hardenable, while INOR-8 is
immune to this undesirable condition.

The influence of aging temperature and time upon the hardness of
Hastelloy B welded joints was determined. The tensile properties of all-
weld-metal samples of these alloys, both in the as-welded and welded and
aged conditions were also determined. Photomicrographs of welds in both

conditions are shown.

INTRODUCTION

The relatively extreme conditions of corrosion encountered in the petro-
leum, petro-chemical, and chemical industries have necessitated the use of
structural materials possessing outstanding resistance to corrosion. In
order to handle the various corrosive liquids, the structural materials must
be capable of being readily fabricable into pressure vessels, heat exchangers,
tanks, and other related equipment. Nickel-base alloys containing molybdenum
have been utilized extensively in a large number of these applications,
including service in hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, oxidizing salts,

1,2,3,k

alkaline solutions, and many other highly corrosive media.

The American Society of Mechanical Engineers' Pressure Vessel Code has
recognized the nickel-molybdenum alloys Hastelloy Alloy B and Hastelloy Alloy
C as being suitable materials for use in unfired pressure vessels. ?© The
service-temperature limitations are 650 and 1000°F, respectively. In addition,
these alloys have been used extensively at higher temperatures for such appli-
cations as turbine blades, conveyor chains, and bolting and shafting components. |
Other nickel-molybdenum alloys have also been frequently utilized for various
industrial applications, but these have not yet been Code approved.

Nuclear reactor systems utilizing molten fluoride salts as the fluid
fuels are very attractive as heat sources for modern steam power plants.’
One important requirement of these reactor systems is that the structural
materials possess exceptionally good corrosion resistance in the operating-
temperature range of 1200 — 1300°F. The nickel-molybdenum alloys adequately
meet this requirement, and in addition, their elevated-temperature strengths
are comparable to those of the conventional high-temperature alloys. The
1500°F stress-rupture properties of a commercially available nickel-molybdenum
alloy (Hastelloy Alloy B) are shown in Fig. 1 and are compared with those of
type 316 stainless steel and Inconel.

This commercially available alloy (Ni—27% Mo-5% Fe) was investigated in
detail by the Metallurgy Division of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in
order to determine its general suitability for service in the 1200 — 1300°F

temperature range makes it subject to significant embrittlement, both at
room and at elevated temperatures. In addition, the oxidation resistance
is marginal and becomes poor at temperatures above 1500°F,
Consequently, an extensive program wes carried out by the Metallurgy
Division to develop a non-age-hardensble, high-strength, nickel-molybdenum
alloy which possesses excellent corrosion resistance to the molten salts and
good oxidation resistance. An alloy, INOR-8 (Ni—17% Mo-7% Cr-ki% Fe), which
adequately satisfied these conditions’? was developed and is now commercially
available. The favorable creep properties of INOR-8 as compared with those
of Hastelloy Alloy B and Inconel in molten salts at 1300°F are shown in Fig. 2.
Recognizing that a study of the weldability of these alloys was needed,
the properties of welds in Hastelloy Alloy B and INOR-8 at the temperatures of
interest were determined. A commercially available filler metal, Hastelloy
Alloy we (Ni—25% Mo-5% Cr—5% Fe), which age hardens to a lesser extent than
Hastelloy Alloy B, was also investigated, since it was used extensively for
test-component fabrication during the time interval in which INOR-8 was

under development.

MATERTAL

The Hastelloy Alloy B and INOR-8 parent plate used for this study was
1/2 in. thick. Hastelloy Alloy B weld wire, 3/32 in. and 1/8 in. in diameter,
was used for the deposition of the test welds of this material. Hastelloy
Alloy W weld deposits on Hastelloy Alloy B plate were also made with filler
wire of these two sizes.

At the time of this investigation, INOR-8 filler wire wes not available
for the deposition of welds on this material. Consequently, strips of approxi-
mately square cross section were sheared from 0.10-in.-thick sheet material.

The chemical analyses of these materials are shown in Table I.

all-weld-metal tensile specimens shown in Fig. 3 were machined in accordance
with the recommendations of the American Welding Society. 13 Testing was
performed on a 12,000-1b-maximum hydraulic tensile-testing machine at a
strain rate of 0.05 in. /min,

Aging of hardness, tensile, and metallographic specimens at elevated
temperatures was performed in evacuated quartz capsules to eliminate the
effect of the atmosphere. The encapsulated specimens were heated in box-type
electric-resistance furnaces.

The etchant used in the metallographic examination was chrome regia
(1 part 1% chromic acid solution, 3 parts hydrochloric acid, and 10 parts
water). Etching was performed at room temperature for times varying from
3 to 5 sec.

Hardness measurements were made with a Vickers diamond pyramid indenter

with a 10-kg load.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

The preparation of the numerous all-weld-metal tensile, hardness, and
metallographic specimens used in this investigation required the manual
deposition of extensive quantities of weld metal in the grooves of weld test
plates. A joint design was selected which would provide a relatively large
weld-metal cross section. Parent plates, 1/2 in. thick and 20 in. long, were
machined and assembled to permit a square-groove weld with a 5/8-in. width.
All-weld-metal 0.252-in.-dla reduced=-section tensile specimens were machined
from these weld test plates, and hardness and metallographic specimens of
adequate size were readily obtained from the remaining portions of the plate.

A sketch showing the welding sequence used in the fabrication of a
typical weld -test plate is shown in Fig. 4. A photograph of a typical setup
after completion of welding is shown in Fig. 5. The utilization of the large
hold-down plates provided restraint and prevented appreciable distortion of
the base plate during welding. The welding operators were qualified in accord-
ance with approved practices for high-quality applications. The data for each

weld was recorded, evaluated for possible trends or discrepancies, and
filed for reference.

The welded joints were then dye-penetrant inspected and radiographed
to determine the presence of porosity, cracking, or other defects. All the
alloys discussed in this report were found to be readily weldable, and no
difficulties were encountered. The all-weld-metal tensile, hardness, and
metallographic specimens were machined from the 20-in.-long weld deposits.

All-weld-metal tensile specimens were tested at room temperature and
at 1200°F in the as-~welded and welded-and-aged conditions. Hardness trav-
erses across welded joints were made in order to determine the extent of age
hardening occurring in both weld metal and parent plate at various temperatures

and time intervals.

RESULTS

Since the aging behavior of Hastelloy Alloy B and Hastelloy Alloy W
welds appeared to be the result of the precipitation of a phase or phases,
the effects of aging time and aging temperature on the room-temperature
hardness were studied and correlated with the observed microstructures.
The mechanical properties of weld metal, before and after aging at 1200°F,
were also determined. Welds of the non-age-hardenable alloy, INOR-8, were
included in this study for comparative purposes.

The nickel-molybdenum binary-phase diagram shown in Fig. was used

extensively as a guide in this investigation, as was other available information

16,17 This information was particularly useful in interpreting

on this system,
the mechanical property, hardness, and microstructural changes occurring as a
result of aging, although the presence of chromium and other elements have been

shown to have some influence upon the phase boundaries.”

A, Hardness Studies

Hastelloy Alloy B - The effect of aging for 200 hr at 1100, 1200, 1300,
and 1500°F upon the room-temperature hardness of Hastelloy Alloy B welded
joints is shown in Fig. 7. These hardness traverses across the welded joint
indicate that hardening of both the weld metal and parent plate occurs during
exposure in the temperature range 1100 — 1500°F. This condition is the most
pronounced upon aging at 1300°F, but significant hardening at 1100, 1200, and
1500°F is also evident. Aging at 1300°F appears to cause the area immediately
adjacent to the weld fusion line to be particularly susceptible to hardening.

Because of the pronounced hardening of the Hastelloy Alloy B welded
Joints occurring at 1300°F, this temperature was used to determine the effect
of time at the aging temperature. From the hardness profiles shown in Fig. 8,
it can be seen that significant weld-metal hardening occurs in times as short
as 24 hr. The hardness of the base metal and weld metal increases appreciably
with increasing time at temperature until a VHN of 525 is obtained near the
fusion line after 500 hr. A VHN of 275 was observed in this area in the
as-welded condition.

It will be noted that the hardness traverses of the aged specimens in
Figs. 7 and 8 reveal a gradual increase in parent-metal hardness as the weld
fusion line is approached. This hardness gradient in the specimens aged at
1300°F for 200 and 500 hr occurs over a distance of 0.7 in. or greater, which
is considerably wider than the conventional heat-affected zone of the weld.
This condition is a result of accelerated precipitation as shown in Fig. 9.

A similar panorama of the material in the as-welded condition is shown in

Fig, 10.

| The precipitation gradient is thought to be attributable to the presence
of plastic strain in the weldment created by the repeated heating and cooling
of the base metal during the welding operation. The restraint provided by the
thick hold-down plates was sufficient to inhibit free movement of the base
metal, and a readily visible reduction in cross sectional area resulted. Un-
published work at ORNL has indicated that wrought Hastelloy Alloy B containing
a slight degree of cold work hardens very rapidly at these temperatures, with
the amount of hardening occurring during a given time interval varying signifi-

cantly with the amount of cold work.

Some hardening of the Hastelloy Alloy B parent plate adjacent to the fusion
line was also evident in the as-welded condition. This was attributed to cold
work rather than to aging during welding, since two non-age-hardenable alloys,
INOR-8 and Inconel, also revealed similar hardening characteristics as is
shown in Fig. 11.

Annealing of a welded joint for 1 hr at 1950°F prior to aging at 1300°F
to accomplish stress relief and recrystallization eliminated the hardness
gradient in the base metal, as shown in Fig. 12. The lower weld-metal hardness
of the annealed-and-aged specimen was attributed partially to weld-metal homog-
enization occurring during the annealing operation, as well as to stress relief
of the weld deposit.

Since the behavior of welds at a typical operating temperature of 1200°F
was considered to be of prime importance, the effect of aging time at this
temperature upon the weld metal-hardness was determined. The results are in-
cluded in Fig. 13. They again indicate that extensive age hardening occurs,
although to the lesser degree than that observed at 1300°F,

Hastelloy Alloy W - The nickel-molybdenum—chromium alloy filler metal
Hastelloy Alloy W also ages extensively in the temperature range 1100 — 1500°F,
The influence of time at the aging temperature of 1200°F upon the room-
temperature hardness of Hastelloy Alloy W weld metal is included in Fig. 13.

It is evident that the extent of aging at this temperature is less than that
noted for Hastelloy Alloy B.

INOR-8 - Aging of INOR-8 weld metal at 1200°F did not result in an in-
crease in hardness as is evident from the curve shown in Fig. 13. Traverses
made on joints after aging for 200 hr at 1100, 1200, 1300, and 1500°F and for
1000 hr at 1200°F also revealed no hardening.

After 1000 hr at 1200°F the Hastelloy Alloy B has reached a VHN of kro,
the Hastelloy Alloy W has reached a VHN of 360, while the INOR-8 maintains
its as-welded VHN of 250,

B. Room- Temperature and Elevated-Temperature Tensile Studies

The influence of aging at a typical reactor operating temperature of
1200°F upon the room-temperature mechanical properties of weld metal of the
three alloys is shown in Fig. 14. The tensile strengths of the age-hardenable
alloys Hastelloy Alloy B and Hastelloy Alloy W increase markedly by aging

for 200 hr. Slight additional increases in the strengths are evident after
aging for an additional 300 hr. The room-temperature ductilities, however,
continue to decrease markedly with increasing time at temperature, with the
elongation of Hastelloy Alloy B weld metal being reduced to 3% after aging
for 500 hr at 1200°F. The INOR-8 alloy, on the other hand, shows very little
change in the tensile strength or the ductility upon aging for extended
periods at 1200°F.

The tensile properties of the three alloys at 1200°F are shown in Fig. 15.
The tensile strength of the age-hardenable alloys increases with increasing
time at temperature, and the ductility decreases. Again the Hastelloy Alloy B
exhibits a ductility of 3% after aging for 500 hr. INOR-8, however, exhibits
an increase in ductility, probably as a result of some carbide spheroidization

or redistribution.

C. Metallographic Studies

Hastelloy Alloy B - The microstructure of Hastelloy Alloy B weld metal in
the as-welded condition exhibits the presence of carbides in the grain bound-
aries and between dendrites. Aging at 1200°F produces a very fine Widmanstatten-
type precipitate which has tentatively been identified as the beta phase of the
nickel-molybdenum binary diagram. This precipitate probably caused the extensive
hardening of the material noted in the preceding discussion.

A coarser and more general Widm#nstatten type of precipitation in the weld
metal was noted upon aging at 1300°F. The extensive hardening of the base metal
and weld metal noted upon aging at this temperature is also apparently
associated with the beta phase.

The hardening noted at 1500°F is due to the precipitation of an angular
phase which, according to the nickel-molybdenum phase diagram, may be the
gamma phase. A composite of the microstructures occurring from aging at these
temperatures is shown at 200 X and 1000 X in Fig. 16.

‘Hastelloy Alloy W - The microstructure of Hastelloy Alloy W weld metal

in the as-welded condition is shown in Fig. 17. Aging at 1200°F produced no
precipitate visible under the microscope at 1000 X; however, the presence of a
submicroscopic precipitate is postulated in view of the significant hardening
and ductility decrease noted after exposure to this temperature for extended

periods, Less precipitation than that observed in Hastelloy Alloy B would be

expected, since the addition of chromium to nickel-molybdenum alloys tends
to suppress the formation of the beta phase? Less precipitation might
also be expected, since the molybdenum content of Hastelloy Alloy W is
somewhat lower than that of Hastelloy Alloy B.

INOR-8 - The microstructure of INOR-8 weld metal in the as-welded
condition is shown in Fig. 18. The presence of extensive interdendritic and
grain-boundary carbides is evident. Aging at 1200°F for times up to 1000 hr

revealed no evidence of a precipitate.

CONCLUSIONS

Within the limits of this investigation, the following conclusions
can be drawn:

1. The commercially available nickel-molybdenum alloy Hastelloy Alloy B
and the nickel-molybdenum—chromium alloy Hastelloy Alloy W are readily weld-
able by the inert-gas-shielded tungsten-arc process and exhibit no difficulties
with regard to cracking and porosity. The room- and elevated-temperature
mechanical properties of weld metal in the as-welded condition are adequate
for molten-salt reactor service.

2. Hardness studies indicate that Hastelloy Alloy B weldments (weld
metal and parent plate) are subject to significant age hardening during
service in the temperature range 1100 — 1500°F, with the greatest hardening
noted at 1300°F. The effect of aging at 1200°F was studied extensively and
was found to increase the room- and elevated-temperature tensile strength of
weld metal, while severely decreasing the ductility.

3. An increased hardening in the parent metal of Hastelloy Alloy B
weldments adjacent to the weld was attributed to plastic strain in the
weldment created during the welding operation.

Lk, The precipitate observed in Hastelloy Alloy B welds and parent plate
after aging at 1300°F and below has been tentatively identified as the beta
phase of the binary nickel-molybdenum phase diagram, while that at 1500°F
has been tentatively identified as the gamma phase.

>. Hastelloy Alloy W weld metal is also subject to age hardening
at elevated temperatures, but to a lesser extent at 1200°F than Hastelloy
Alloy B. Age hardening raises its room- and elevated-temperature tensile
strength and decreases its ductility significantly. The hardening at 1200°F
is attributed to a submicroscopic precipitate.

6. A non-age-hardenable nickel-molybdenum—chromium alloy which was
developed by the ORNL Metallurgy Division and designated as INOR-8 is
readily weldable. The weld metal possesses acceptable mechanical properties

at room temperature and at 1200°F. This alloy is now commercially available,
