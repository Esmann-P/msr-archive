CORE IRRADIATION-SPECIMEN ARRAY FOR MSRE RUNS 19 and 20

Sp MASTER

v Abstract

a

A new MSRE core specimen array was designed and fabricated to
replace the type of metallurgical surveillance specimen array that
was used in the MSRE through Run 18. The main purpose of the new
array is to measure the capture-to-absorption ratio of 2337 and to
determine the effects of salt velocity, turbulence, and surface
finish on the deposition of fission products on graphite and on
Hastelloy-N. Two additional test specimens were included, one of
pyrolytic graphite to determine if there is permeation of fuel salt
or its constituents into the graphite and one of Hastelloy-N to ex-
pose a series of electron microscope screens in a trapped gas pocket.

.. The new specimen array was installed on July 31, 1969 and was ex-
posed in the reactor core for 12,943 Mwhrs of reactor operation during
Runs 19 and 20.

Introduction

During nuclear operation of the MSRE through May 1969, the graphite
sampler assembly contained samples of graphite and Hastelloy- N which were
used to determine the effects of the reactor environment on these materials,
including corrosion and the effects of irradiation on the physical proper-
ties and to determine the deposition of fission products on the materials,?
Assemblies of this type were removed in July 1966, May 1967, April 1968,
and June 1969, After the latter removal, the same type of array was not
reinstalled because the relatively short exposure that:would occur before
the planned final shutdown of the MSRE would add little to the information
obtained during the previous long exposures. Instead, a different sample
assembly was designed to utilize the existing space in the core, This new
assembly is ‘described in this report.

~The new assembly contained several experiments for fission product
deposition studies and four graphite capsules containing uranium isotopes
for measuring nuclear properties of 23%, Two of the uranium capsules
contained about l-gr total of 23% and 23°y and the other two contained
about 1-gr total of 234U and ®3%y, The other specimens of graphite and
Hastelloy-N were designed to study the effects of flow, surface finish,
and turbulence. on the fission product deposition. A specimen of pyrolytic
graphite was included for salt permeation studies and the final specimen
formed a gas trap where electron microscope screens were exposed to detect
the presence of colloidal materials. The design details of the individual
specimens and of the assembly are shown on ORNL Drawings M-10551-RB-001,
M-10551-RB-002, and M-10551-RB-003 (Footnote-2).

The new specimen array was installed into the MSRE core on July 31,
1969 and was exposed during Runs 19 and 20. Table I summarizes the ex-

-- posure history of the array. The specimen array was scheduled for removal
about December 15, 1969.

Mechanical Design of the Cage and Basket Assembly

In order to keep the assembly as simple as possible, each capsule or
specimen was made cylindrical with an outside diameter of 1-1/4 inches,
This was the largest diameter that could be held in a removable cage in-
side the existing basket design. The individual experiments within the
assembly are more completely described later in the report.

Figure 1 shows the completed cage and basket assemblies. The new
basket assembly is generally the same size and shape as the previous ones,
but is made from 2-in. OD by 0.062-in, wall Hastelloy~N tubing (control
rod thimble material) because the perforated sheet used previously was not
available, The large slots in the lower part of the basket assembly were
to reduce the metal volume and the neutron flux depression to a minimum in
the vicinity of the uranium-containing capsules. The smaller slots at
the top of the basket are to ensure an adequate salt flow through the
upper portion of the basket. :

The cage assembly consists of three vertical 3/16- in.-diameter rods
held by end fittings and with spacer rings welded at intervals along the
length. The lower end fitting was welded to the vertical rods and forms
a flow passage which directs about half of the salt flow from the inlet
tube of the basket into the center of the first test specimen. The top

end fitting, which was removable to facilitate loading and unloading the
test specimens, slips over the three rods and was held in place by
1/16-in.-dia. wire clips.

The bottom test specimen was pinned to the lower end fitting to re-
sist any pressure drop effects. The other specimens were loose in the
cage and were free to expand and contract as necessary. The total length
of test specimens was adjusted during assembly by machining the length of
the top metal filler plug to provide end clearance with the cage assembly.
At operating temperature the end clearance increased to about 0.42 in,
due to differential thermal expansion. The graphite specimens, which
would normally float in salt, were held down by the weight of the top:
metal specimens and the filler plug.

The assembly procedure of the cage into the basket and the installa-
tion of the basket into the reactor vessel were the same as for the previous
graphite sampler assemblies, The assembly of the cage and basket was sim-
plified by the use of all new parts. However, a previously used "Ball-Lock'
assembly" was used to complete the basket assembly, and the radiation level
of this part required the final pinning operation to be completed in a hot
cell,

The radiation from the ball-lock assembly was sufficiently low that
the completed assembly could be carried from the Hot Cell to the MSRE in |
a pipe carrier with relatively light shielding on one end. An argon at-

mosphere was maintained on the uranium capsules and on the completed
assembly as much of the time as possible, The total exposure of the

uranium capsules to atmosphere was about one hour or less,

annulus was introduced through the lower end fitting of the cage assembly
and was driven by the pressure drop across the graphite lattice-bar grid
at the bottom of the reactor vessel. The salt velocity through the
1/16-in, annulus was estimated to be 2.5 ft/sec as compared to 0.8 ft/sec
on the outside of the specimen, The effect of salt velocity on deposition
can be obtained by comparing inside and outside surfaces of the graphite.
Different surface finishes were used on both the internal and the external
surfaces so that the effect of surface finish can be determined. The
external surfaces will also be used as a reference for the graphite speci-
men with the turbulence wire. The graphite parts were made of POCO grade
AXF-5Q. This grade of graphite was selected because of its uniform pore
size. Grade CGB graphite, such as constitutes the MSRE core, was not used
for this specimen because the pieces of this graphite still in stock all
had numerous cracks that would cause misleadingly high indications of
apparent surface deposition.

Uranium Capsules
The next section of the specimen assembly contains four graphite

capsules that contain mixtures of uranium isotopes in a NaF-ZrF, carrier
salt, The purpose of these capsules is to determine, for the energy spec-

trum at the capsules, the capture-to-absorption ratio of 23% and to de-

termine the absorption cross sections of the other uranium isotopes relative

to 23%, Two sizes of capsules were provided, the long capsules containing
primarily 233 and 278y and the short capsules containing 234U and 23€y,
After exposure the salt mixtures will be analyzed for uranium 233, 23k,
235, 236, and 238 and for 23°pu, The production or depletion of these
isotopes will be obtained by comparison with similar analyses of unir-
radiated samples of the salt mixtures, The isotopic concentrations of
uranium in the original salt mixtures as calculated from the analyses of
the source materials are shown in Table II,

The total weights of salt for the long and short capsules were L9.k
and 25.0 grams respectively giving a total uranium content of 1 gram per
capsule, Since the analyses will be done on the basis of isotopic ratios

the exact quantity of salt or uranium is not important. The NaF-ZrF,

carrier salt was selected so that any leakage of MSRE fuel or flush salt
into the capsules could be detected by an analysis for lithium.

The heat generation rates within the salt mixtures were estimated
to be 170 and 100 watts respectively for the long and short capsules.
The total temperature rise in the capsule was estimated at about 300°F,
but most of this is in the salt mixture and in the outside convective film,
The high thermal conductivity limits the temperature gradients within the
graphite so that thermal stresses are not a problem.

Each capsule contains a series of flux and temperature monitors lo-
cated on the vertical center line. The flux monitors consisted of 302

stainless-steel wire and a_silver-copper alloy. These monitors will give

- an indication of both the thermal and fast fluxes, The temperature moni-

tors are small rods of SiC 1/2-in, long which sustain a dimensional change
under irradiation. The irradiation temperature is the temperature at
which this dimensional change can be annealed out.

The design details of the capsules are shown on Drawing M-10551-RB-002
(Reference 1) and in Figure 3. The anmilar salt cavity 3/4-in,-OD by
1/2-in, ID reduced the centerline temperature of the capsule and also

provided a convenient location for the flux and temperature monitors in
the central graphite core, POCO graphite grade AXF-5QBG was selected to
avoid the neutron depression that would occur with Hastelloy-N and to pro-
vide a satisfactorily low salt permeability. The capsules were sealed by
welding the ends of two molybdenum rings that were each vacuum brazed to
the graphite body or cap with a 85Cu-10Ni-5Cr brazing alloy at 1250°C and
10"5 torr. A direct braze between the graphite body and cap was not used
because of the high temperatures that would have been required on the com-
pleted and salt-filled assembly.

The integrity of the brazed joint between the molybdenum rings and
graphite was the most important mechanical problem. The metallographic
examination of the test braze indicated that the braze was satisfactory,
but the initial production brazes leaked helium when subjected to 10-psig

pressure. The brazing procedure was revised to include coating the gra-

phite surfaces with Cra, to facilitate wetting of the graphite by the.

brazing alloy. Subsequent brazes were satisfactory, but one cap was re-

© jected because of a large. pore in the graphite.

Following the brazing operation, the capsules were leak-tested in an
alcohol bath with 10-psig helium, - Since the graphite is porous to helium,
the leak test was used only to screen out any parts with abnormally large
pores or any parts with a poor braze. The capsules were then cleaned in
an untrasonic alcohol bath and vacuum-dried at 300°C. * The flux and
temperature monitors, which had been previously cleaned, dried and assembled
into glass tubes, were installed and the capsules were delivered for salt
filling. -

The salt mixtures were prepared and loaded into the capsules by the
Chemical Technology Division. The salt was prepared in one melt for each

of the two compositions. The salt in each melt was crushed and weighed

into batches for the individual capsules. The crushed salt was loaded

into the capsules as dry powder and then melted down under an argon atmos-

phere. . i
After the loading and meltdown of the salt was completed, the capsules
were sealed by TIG welding the exposed ends of ‘the molybdenum rings, - The

welding was done in an argon atmosphere without the use of filler wire.
 

1h

The welds were inspected visually and by liquid penetrant. The completed
capsules and the excess salt mixtures contained in small glass jars were
sealed in plastic with an argon atmosphere until ready for use.

The original plans were to load the salt mixtures into four capsules
of each type, but one capsule of each type was rejected during fabrication.
Two of each type were assembled into the core specimen array and the third,
along with the excess salt, 1s being held to develop the salt recovery and
analytical procedures and to provide the isotopic concentrations of the un-
irradiated salt.

Table III shows the monitor data and core location for each capsule.

Pyrolytic Graphite

A rectangular specimen of pyrolytic graphite as shown in Figure L
is immediately above the uranium capsules. The test specimen is 0.5-in. x
0.687-in, x 6,0-in. long and is held in the cage assembly by circular
pieces of POCO AXF-5Q graphite pinned to each end. The layer planes of
the graphite are parallel to the 0.687-in. x 6-in, surfaces. The depth of
any penetration of salt or its constituents into the graphite both parallel
and perpendicular to the layer planes, will be determined by proton acti-
vation technique. The specimen will also be analyzed for the penetration
of fission products both parallel and perpendicular to the graphite layer
planes, The weight of the test specimens above the pyrolytic graphite is
transferred from the outer diameter of the top end ring to the central
region by a 1/8-in. thick Hastelloy-N disk,

Graphite Tube with Turbulence Wire

The next specimen is a graphite tube machined from POCO AXF-5Q. The
test section is a l-in.-diameter cylinder with three 2-in,.-long sections
with different surface finishes (5, 25, and 125 RMS). The bore diameter
is 1/2-in, with surface finish bands of 5 and 125 RMS, The OD of the test
section has a coil of 1/16-1n, Hastelloy-N wire wound on a 1/2-in, pitch
and with a 20-mil radial clearance between the graphite surface and the
wire, The original design called for spacers between the wire and the
graphite, but these were eliminated because of welding problems with the
thin spacers, The wire coil is to promote turbulence on the outside sur-

face of the graphite. Figure 5 is a photograph os this test specimen,

The salt flow rates on both the internal and external surfaces are
somewhat more uncertain than on the bottom flow-tube specimen because the
pressure drop is not well defined. However, both the internal and ex-
ternal velocities should be about the same as outside the sample basket
or about 1 to 2 ft/sec.

The quantity of fission-product deposition as a function of surface
finish will be determined for both the inside and outside surfaces. The
effect of the turbulence wire will be determined by comparison with the
graphite flow tube at the bottom of the assembly.

Hastelloy-N Tube with Turbulence Wire

This test specimen, shown in Figure 6, is a duplicate of the graphite
specimen just described except that it is constructed of Hastelloy-N.

Both of these specimens will be subjected to about the same conditions and
will provide the same type of information. The effect of the turbulence
wire will be determined by comparison with the surface of the electron
microscope screen holder,

The double wall design of this specimen, and the next one above, pre-
vents contamination of the surface under study from the exposure of the
opposite surface, The test specimen will be sawed into individual rings
for each surface finish and then each ring will be dissolved for analysis,
This procedure eliminates the necessity for machining off the surface for
analysis.

Gas Trap and Electron Microscope Screen Holder

The last test specimen will trap a sample of gas that may be circu-
lating in the core and expose several electron microscope screens to this
gas so that any colloidal or particulate material can be collected and
examined, Figure T is a photograph of this specimen with the central rod,
which holds the microscope screens, removed. The drilled holes in the

rod slope downward and will trap salt so that the maximum salt level during

operation can be determined.
The sealed cavity formed by the double wall was filled with helium to
improve the heat transfer and to reduce the temperature of the central rod

to about 100°F above the salt temperature.

* The specimen array was removed from the MSRE core on December 18,
1969 and delivered to the hot cell on the 19th. The assembly was free
of salt and was in good mechanical condition. The individual specimens
were removed from the assembly on December 22, 1969.

The detailed examination and analysis of the fission-product
deposition specimens will be directed and reported by S. S. Kirslis
and the analysis and results of the uranium capsule experiments will be
