Introduction.

Techniques for determining the frequency response of multi-variable
dynamic systems are well kriown and ‘several computer codes have been
prepared which are useful for calculating nuclear power reactor frequency
responses 2 The frequency .reésponse is usually determined for the system
at the design condition and at several off-désign conditions to determine
the sensitivity of the results to ¢hangés in system parameters: This
sensitivity information cad be useful in fexdésign of dynamically unsatis-
factory systems and in ‘determination of. necessary tolerances in design
specifications to insure suitable dynamic behavior at lowest cost.
Sensitivity information can also provide a deépetr understanding of system
dynamic characteristics to the system analyst and can help in matching
experimental and theoretical tesults:.

This report presents a technique for determining the frequericy
response of multi-variable systems. In addition; ‘the sensitivities to
system parameters can be determined directly. -A computer code for
carrying out the calculation is described and numerical results are
shown for sample problems. |

‘Frequency Response
The system equation Tor a’ linear; autonomous, lumped parameter

system may be written:

a, |
— = Az ; :
ToL (1)
where

z = the response vector,

t = time,

A = the system matrix (the elements are the. usual coefficients in

the differential equations);
. f = the disturbance vector:

Eq. (1) i is usually called the state variable representation of the system.
In Eq. (1), it is assumed that the dependent, variables are written as

perturbations arcund an equilibrium point: This implies that all the
initial conditions are zero when the equation is Laplace transformed.

The Laplace transform of (1) is then given by the following equation:

[A-sI]Z=-F , | : (2)
where AE | oo
I = unit diagonal matrix,
s = Laplace transform parameter,
Zz = Laplace transform of Z,
T = Laplace transform of f.

Cramer's rule can be used to write the formal solution of (2):

— By :
2, = ———— (3)
|A - sI Ce
where |
z, =i component of z,
B, = determinant of [A - sI] with the 1th column replaced by -f.

In general, a transfer function expresses the relationship between
an independent variable and some dependent variable. The independent
variable appears as a factor in the disturbance vector, f, on the right

hand side of the system equation. Thus, T may be written as follows:

f = pg : (4)
where
0 = Laplace transform of the selected independent variable - a scalar,
g = a vector of coefficients.

Use Eq. (4) with (3) to give

C

21 i oo
G = = = ——— | (5)
oo 0 |A -sI|
where
G = transfer function between the independent variable, p, and the
dependent variable, z,,
C; = determinant of [A - sI] with the i column replaced by -g.

Q
 

For nuclear reactor applications, the selected independent variable is
most often reactivity, and the selected dependent variable is most often
the neutron flux or a temperature at some point in the system.

The transfer function in Eq. (5) may be used to give the frequency
response, For this, the Laplace transform variable, s, is replaced by
Jw, where J =/~1 and w = the frequency of the perturbation. Thus, the

transfer function becomes a complex quantity:
G=a+ jp . (6)

The appearance of G in the complex plane is shown in Fig. 1. It is common

to characterize G by a magnitude, M, and a phase angle, 8. These are given

by: Co .
M = Jo + BZ 3 (7)
6 = tant 5 . (8)

The variation of M and 6 as a function of the frequency, w, is called the
frequency response of the system.

A number of approaches are possible for solving Eq. (5). The most
obvious is to form the numerator and denominator determinants and to
numerically evaluate these determinants in complex arithmetic. Another
approach is to transform the determinants into polynomials in gs. 17% This
has the advantage that evaluation for numerous frequencies (w = — js)
does not require re-evaluation of the determinants. The choice, then, is
whether to perform the bulk of the computation in finding the polynomial
or in evaluating the determinants. The preference seems to have been for
the polynomial method in most previous calculations. This was done because
the polynomial methods were sufficiently faster than direct determinant
solutions to offset two difficulties characteristic of polynomial methods:
the accurate calculation of the coefficients of the polynomial is a dif-
ficult numerical problem, and the complex relation between the basic system
parameters and the coefficients of the polynomials complicates calculation

of the effect of changes in the parameters.

In this study the desire to determine the effect of changes in
system parameters on the frequency response dictated the use of direct
calculation of the determinants. In contrast to the polynomial methods,
it is easy to keep track of the system parameters and to determine their
effect on the frequency response. It was also found that direct calculation
of the determinants for caloulating the frequency response alone is
inexpensive on large digital computers unless the matrix is quite large.

IBM 7090 has been found to be given by:

If it is assumed that about 25 points are needed to define the
frequency response, then the running time is given approximately in

Frequency Response Sensitivity
It is frequently valuable to know what changes in the frequency
response will occur if certain of the system parameters should change.

It would be desirable to get this information without recalculating the

 
10

whole frequency response repeatedly. A technique for accomplishing this
is given in this section.

First, rewrite Eq. (5) as shown below:

matrix, A,’

(10)

Equation (10) gives the sensitivity of the frequency response to changes
in the elements of the system matrix. The derivatives on the right side
of Eq. (10) are easily calculated. It can be shown" that the derivative
of a determinant of a matrix with respect to one of its elements is the

cofactor of that element in the matrix. Thus we get:

9G 1
pa =D My ~ Tis) (11)
id
where
0 5 = cofactor of 24 In the numerator matrix, N,
71; = cofactor of 213 in the denominator matrix, D.

It is also necessary to convert the G sensitivity into magnitude

sensitivity and phase sensitivity. First, since 213 is real, we can write:

0G du

Thus the real and imaginary parts of the solution given by Eq. (11) are

clear that the following relations exist:

Equations (11) through (14) are adequate for finding the sensitivities

to matrix element changes. However, these matrix elements are made up

of algebraic combinations of basic system parameters. The same system

parameters frequently occur in several matrix elements.

It is desirable

to find the sensitivities to system parameter changes as well as the sensi-

tivities to matrix element changes. This can easily be done using Egs. (15)

The quantities da 519%, are known since the algebraic relations between

matrix elements and system parameters must be known from the analytical

description of the system.

A special feature of the numerator determinant, N, should be noted.

Thus oN/ da. | does not contain

a contribution from the column replaced by g. However, g can depend on

the system parameters. Thus oN/ 0x, may have a non-zero contribution from

the column of the matrix whose components are the components of g. Thus

the complete equations are:

The Computer Program

A computer program called SFR-1 (Sensitivity of the Frequency
Response) was prepared for the IBM 7090. The computer code is provided
with the system matrix, A (59 x 59 or smaller), and the disturbance
vector, g. For specified values of w, the code calculates the frequency

response using Eq. (5) and s = jw. Equations (7) and (8) are used to

 

IY)
13

give the magnitude and phase. The determinarits in Eq. (5) are calculated
in complex arithmetic using a Gaussian elimination scheme with partial
pivoting’ (obtained from R. E. Funderlic of Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion
Plant). The code also can calculate the sensitivities to matrix element
changes using Eqs. (11), (13), and (14). The sensitivities to the system
parameters are calculated using Egs. (17) and (18). The method for
providing the algebraic relationships between the matrix elements and

the system parameters are given below in the section on input.

Input

The input to SFR-1 is short and simple. The only section requiring
extensive explanation is the algebra table. The algebra table serves to
establish the relationship between matrix ‘elements and system parameters
and the relationship between elements of the disturbance vector and
system parameters. In general, each matrix element or disturbance vector
element is made up of a sum of terms, each of which is an algebraic -

combination of various system parameters:

A table of this type appears in the SFR input. The information in this

table is also used by SFR-1 to calculate the derivatives shown in Eqs.

This is the form of a quadratic lag with a damping ratio of 0.06. This
familiar problem was analyzed with SFR-1. The frequency response and the
sensitivity of the frequency response to changes in the damping ratio

(3 8sn in the system matrix) were calculated. The sensitivities were used
to predict the frequency response when the’ damping ratio changes from

0.06 to 0.05. Table 2 shows the predicted results and a comparison with
exact values. It is clear that the sensitivities provided very reliable
information about the effect of changes in the damping ratio in this
problem. A copy of the SFR-1 input required for this problem is shown

in Table 3.

The frequency response for problem 2 is shown in Fig. 2. Figure 3
shows the sensitivity of the magnitude of the’ frequency response to
changes in the fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity (a) and the
moderator coefficient of reactivity (a). Several observations about the
behavior of the system are immediately obtained from the sensitivity plot.
At frequencies below 0.1 radians/sec, the effect of changes in the fuel

same. However, since the fuel temperature coefficient (a) has a magnitude
which is 10 times as large as the magnitude of the moderator coefficient
(a), it is clear that the effects of fractional changes in a; are 10 times
as large as equal fractional changes in Qe It is also clear that the
frequency response is very sensitive to changes in the temperature coeffi-
¢ients in the frequency range, 0.1 to 0.5 radians/sec. Above 0.5 radians/sec
the graphite effect is much smaller than the fuel effect until they both
diminish to small values at frequencies above 10 radians/sec. These
illustrative results are typical of the results obtained in sensitivity
analysis of reactor systems. The sensitivity data furnish useful infor-
mation about the system which can aid in obtaining the essential under-
standing of the dynamic structure of the system that is needed in analysis,
design, and experiment planning.

-Conclusions

SFR-1 represents a preliminary attempt to obtain frequency response
sensitivities along with the usual frequency response data. The use of
Cramer's rule was expedient in developing the SFR method and certainly

does not represent the most efficient procedure. Nevertheless, the cdlcu-

lations on SFR-1 have proved useful in practical problems’ and the cost of

 
2

the calculation has not been excessive. The only numerical difficulty
observed has occurred at high frequency where inaccurate sensitivities
have been obtained in some problems.

The success with SFR-1 has led to the development of a new computer
code which performs the SFR calculation more efficiently. This code has
been prepared and is now being tested. The SFR method is also being used
to furnish sensitivities to a routine for automatically adjusting the
parameters in a theoretical model to fit experimental frequency response
data. The method being used is similar to the "learning model" approach

used by Margolis and Leondes? in adaptive control applications.
