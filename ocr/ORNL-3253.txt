ABSTRACT

Process corrosion occurring in the current Volatility Pilot Plant
hydrofluorinator and fluorinator in operation at the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory was evaluated by visual .inspections, chemical analyses, trans-
port studies of Ni, Mo, Cr, and Fe, gamma radiography, wax replication,
ultrasonic thickness measurements, ‘and metallographic studies. The modes,
mechanisms, and rates of corrosive attack seem to agree well with previous
experimental work. Significant bulk metal losses and moderate pitting
attack were noted in both vessels. Maximum attack in the hydrofluorinator,
which operated from 650 to 500°C, occurred in the middle vapor region at
a calculated corrosion rate of 20 mils/month, based on 765 hr of molten
fluoride salt residence time, and 0.06 mil/hr, based on 338.5 hr of
hydrogen fluoride exposure time. The fluorinator, which operated at
about 500°C, sustained maximum bulk metal losses in the lower vapor region
at calculated rates of 28 mils/month, based on 694 hr of salt residence
time, and 0.9 mil/hr, based on 30.9 hr of fluorine exposure time.

Calculations based on losses in wall thickness indicate that both
vessels should be capable of handling approximately 100 additional
dissolution runs. These calculations include pitting corrosion in the
hydrofluorinator but ignore effects resulting from intergranular or

other forms of selective attack which may be present in both vessels.
1. INTRODUCTION

The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Fluoride Volatility
Process 1s being developed as a nonaqueous technique for reprocessing

zirconium-clad highly enriched uranium fuel elements or homogeneous
- 2 -
fluoride salt mixtures (such as the NaF-ZrF,-UF, Aircraft Reactor Exper-
iment fuel which has been processed, or the LiF-BeF,-ThF,-ZrF,-UF,; fuel
from the proposed Molten Salt Reactor Experiment). In heterogeneous
fuels the zirconium and uranium are converted to their respective tetra--
fluorides in an NaF-ZrF, or NaF-LiF-ZrF, melt, with HF used as the oxi-
dant. The UF, is further oxidized, in a different vessel, to UFg by
contact with elemental fluorine. The volatile UFg is purified by an
absorption-desorption cycle on NaF pellets and collected in cold traps.
The hydrofluorination step is not required for homogeneous fuels.

The nature and extent of the corrosion occurring in earlier hydro-
fluorination and fluorination vessels, which must sustain the most cor-
rosive environments in the process, have been discussed in other
reports, 1-3

The present Volatility Pilot Plant (VPP) hydrofluorinator is an
INOR-8% vessel approximately 17 ft in height and consists of a top right
cylinder 24 in. in diameter, a bottom cylinder 5 1/2 in. in diameter,
and a conical section connecting the two cylinders. The top cylinder
was formed from 3/8-in. rolled and welded plate, the bottom cylinder
from 1/4-in. plate, and the conical section from 1/2-in. plate.

The VPP fluorination vessel was constructed entirely from 3/8-in.-
thick L (low-carbon) nickel plate, The fluorinator was made by joining
two 16-in.-diam right cylinders with a 5.5-in.-diam neck. The combined
assembly hds a height of 7 ft. Figure 1 is a simplified schematic dia-
gram of the current VPP flowsheet showing relative positions and configu-
rations of the Mark I INOR-8 hydrofluorinator and the Mark IIT L nickel

fluorinator.

2, HYDROFLUORINATOR CORROSION

Corrosion in the Volatility Pilot Plant was observed through 14
dissolution runs using both Zircaloy-2 dummy fuel elements and nonirra-
diated Zircaloy-2 fuel elements containing 0.2 to 0.4 wt % U. Hydro-
fluorination process cycling for the dissolution runs is detailed in
Table 1. Special efforts were made to keep temperatures as low as
practical by using lower melting NaF-LiF-ZrF, salt baths rather than NaF-
ZrF, melts and by reducing the initial dissolution bath temperature of
650°C to about 500°C as rapidly as possible. Higher temperatures have a

strongly adverse effect on Volatility Process corrosion. 3

2.1 Reaction to Environment

After run TU-7, the hydrofluorinator was carefully inspected for
determining the extent of process corrosion and for evaluating its future
usefulness for processing naval reactor fuel elements. The nondestructive
inspection procedures included visual examination, chemical analyses of
corrosion-dissolution products, transport studies of Ni, Mo, Cr, and Fe,
complete gamma radiography of the vessel walls, wax replication of a
portion of the interior walls of the hydrofluorinator, and ultrasonic
thickness measurements to determine bulk metal losses. There were no
surveillance corrosion specimens included in the hydrofluorinator. How-
ever, metallographic examination was done on an INOR-8 pipe support clip
which had been exposed to the same environments as the salt region of

the hydrofluorinator vessel proper.
2.1.1 Visual Examination

Following an inspection of the interior walls of the hydrofluorinator
by means of the naked eye, the visual inspection techniques consisted in
low-magnification viewing with the Omniscope, 2 an interior-type periscope,

and the Questar, © a catadioptric instrument using a combined lens-mirror

system. In order to examine the vertical walls.of the hydrofluorinator
with the Questar, highly polished mirrors and a light source, both held
by thin structural members, were lowered into the vessel and the Questar
was positioned above the fuel-charging chute.”

The regions of the hydrofluorinator that had been in contact with
process vapors were covered with a beige~colored deposit, while the salt-
containing area appeared to be black with tints of green and brown. Dark-
colored coarse flakes of material were noted on top of the hydrogen
fluoride distributor plate (Fig. 2). The flakes had the appearance of
dried salts discolored by corrosion-dissolution products. (The LiF-NaF-
ZrF, salts used during dissolution are white in color and develop a
greenish cast as UF, is added to the mixture.) The deposits on the dis-
tributor plate also appeared to contain metallic particles. Some of the
‘deposits adhering to the vertical walls and interior piping in the salt
‘region were of appreciable thickness and were loosely adherent. Typical
of these regions is the deposit noted on the thermocouple well and shown
in Fig. 3.

In order to study the actual walls of the hydrofluorinator, several
attempts were made to remove the corrosion-dissolution deposits. The
cleaning schedule used and subsequent observations are given in Table 2.
Despite the ambitious cleaning program, about half of the wall deposits
remained tenaciously attached to the walls of the hydrofluorinator. Addi-
tional low-magnification studies of the interior of the vessel gave indi-
cations of pitting attack, especially in the conical section joining the
top and bottom right cylinders and. in the lower third of the top cylinder.
(More information on this pitting attack was acquired later by gamma
radiography and wax replication of the hydrofluorinator and is given in

Sec. 2.1.3.)

can be forced to react with HF even though a positive free-energy change
is involved. Evidence of small but finite dissolution rates of molybdenum
metal during hydrofluorination conditions has been reported.® All the
cxidation reactions indicated above are part of the initial stages of
corrosion in the VPP hydrofluorinator.

The corrosion resistance of the hydrofluorinator would be consider-
ably enhanced if the corrosion products (fluorides of Ni, Mo, Cr, and Fe)
were adherent to the hydrofluorinator walls and impervious to the further
passage of HF, of low volatility, unaffected by erosion, and not soluble
in nor complexible with the NaF-LiF-ZrF, dissolution bath. However, most
of these conditions do not exist and therefore the fluoride films are not
protective. Moreover, all or some of the fluorides formed irom the
INOR-8 + HF reaction can be reduced by the zirconium metal present in the
system, by more electropositive elements present (for example, Cr metal
should reduce the fluorides of Mo, Ni, and Fe) or by hydrogen gas from
dissolution and corrosion reactions, At 600°C, the free energies of
formation (relative to HF gas as zero) of MoF,, NiF,, FeF,, CrF,, and
ZrF, are +14, +2, -5, -12, and -31 kcal per gram-atom of fluorine, re-

by the numerous possible interactions, most of the knowledge gained to
date has been through small-scale process studies and subsequent exami=-
nation of process development vessels.

Chemical analyses of the off-gas stream from the hydrofluorinator,
of the waste salt from the VPP, and of the movable-bed absorber have been
studied? 13 as a means of estimating past and future corrosion of the
dissolver vessel. Figure 4 shows the transport paths of Ni, Mo, Cr, and
Fe during the 14 dissolution runs, and approximate mean percentages of
the total of each element found either as a metal or as a fluoride.
Quantitatively, during each run considerably more Ni, Cr, and Fe were
found in the waste salt, movable-bed absorber, or off-gas system than
had been introduced into the system from the feed salts or the fuel ele-
ments. This was the first positive indication of hydrofluorinator cor-
rosion. On the other hand, only about half the molybdenum introduced
from the feed salt was found in other regions of the process system, 11512
Other work® indicates that the molybdenum may be plating out in the
hydrofluorinator and/or possiblyl4 combining as an intermetallic compound
with nickel in the INOR-8. The transport and final disposition(s) of

molybdenum are being investigated.

visual examination and to reveal the condition of the weld joints and
possible cracking in the vessel walls. Cassettes containing film were
wrapped around the exterior walls of the vessel, and an Iri®? gamma
source was located inside the hydrofluorinator along the vertical center
line. The source strength at the time of use was 17 curies. A 5-mil
lead foil directly in front of the film and a 10-mil lead shield behind
the film were used to prevent scatter and to intensify the image.

~ The radiographic film revealed only three regions in the hydro-
fluorinator where pitting seemed to be present. One area, which had
been exposed to process vapors, was within a 2~in.-diam circle about
36 in. down from the top of the upper cylinder in the north quadrant.
The deepest pit here, based on a 2% sensitivity factor for the film and
radiographic technique, was about 7.5 mils. The other two areas were
in the east quadrant of the 1/2-in.-thick conical section of the hydro-
fluorinator and about © in. down from the top of the cone. The maximum
depth of pitting here seemed to be about 10 mils.

All weld joints appeared to be in good condition on the hydro-

fluorination vessel, and no macrocracking was obvious.
2.1.4 Wax Replication

To cross-check the radiographic work and to prove conclusively the
pitting attack, wax replications were made of the interior walls of the
vessel, The technique for obtaining these impressions was proposed by
R. P. Milford (Chemical Technology Division) and the early experimental
work was done by Smith; + important modifications and the actual wall
impressions were made by Crump. 1©

Briefly, the replication technique involved lowering into the hydro-~
fluorinator and horizontally positioning an air cylinder to which was

attached a small container filled with dental molding wax, heating the

wax to a suitable temperature, and activating the air cylinder to press
the softened wax against the wall of the vessel. Figure 5 shows the
replication device in mockup position during heating. Since the device,
as presently designed, requires large internal clearances, only portions
of the top cylinder of the hydrofluorinator could be replicated.

Initial replication confirmed the pitting attack in the vapor-phase
region observed on the radiographic film. Duplicate impressions, at
different times, disclosed that the maximum pitting depth here was 8 mils.
Figure 6 shows portions of the replications illustrating the configuration
of the pit. The height of the replication was measured by a toolmaker's
microscope and was cross-checked by an optical comparator and a dial gage
with a long lever arm.

The excellent results obtained with the initial replication made it
desirable to extend the work to a survey of the entire top cylinder. These
replications were done in a spiral, clockwise pattern starting at the top
of the cylinder and continuing down to the conical section. The results
are given in Table 3. While the 8-mil pit previously found proved to be
the deepest discontinuity, many other pits were found varying from 0.5 to
5.5 mils in depth.

Replications were also made of portions of circumferential and longi-
. tudinal welds in the hydrofluorinator; portions of the replications are
shown in Fig. 7. The impressions indicated the welds to be in good condi-

tion with little, if any, evidence of corrosive attack.

2.1.5 Ultrasonic Thickness Measurements

 

A vidigage, *7 which had an accuracy of approximately +1%, was used
to determine wall thinning. Readings were taken every 3 surface contour
inches, generally vertical, in all four quadrants, and the results were
compared with base-line data obtained with the same instrument when
the hydrofluorinator was installed in the pilot plant. The losses in

wall thickness are plotted in Fig. 8 vs elevation, starting from the top

of the upper cylinder. Since the losses did not seem to vary particu-
larly with quadrant geometry, they were plotted at each elevation. The
maximum and minimum loss points in the bottom and top cylinders and in
the conical connector were connected to form loss ranges in each geometric
region.

Average bulk metal losses in the top and bottom cylinders were 6 and
4 mils, respectively, but maximum losses were 18 and 12 mils. The average
wall~-thickness loss in the connecting cone was 10 mils, while the maximum
loss there was 16 mils. Similarly, the average losses in the salt, salt-
vapor interface, and vapor regions were, respectively, 4, 6, and 6 mils,
‘with corresponding maximum losses of 12, 16, and 18 mils.

The depths of the pits in the upper portion of the hydrofluorinator,
as determined by wax replication, are shown in Fig. 8 as extensions of
the appropriate wall-thickness loss points, depending on the particular
quadrants where each form of corrosion was found.

The maximum attack to date occurred in the middle vapor region at a
calculated corrosion rate of 20 mils/month, based on 765 hr of molten
fluoride salt residence time, and 0.06 mil/hr, based on 338.5 hr of HF

exposure time.

2.1.6 Metallography and Chemistry of Corrosion Product Layers

 

Additional information on INOR-8 corrosion in hydrofluorination serv-
. ice was obtained by examination of a pipe support clip originally located
below the salt level in the current VPP hydrofluorinator. Metal thickness
losses of 5 mils were noted by micrometer measurement. These correspond
to salt-phase hydrofluorinator wall thinning found by ultrasonic thickness
measurements,

A black, semiadherent scale was present on the clip and was found to
be depleted in chromium and iron when compared with the base metal (Fig. 9).
The nickel content of the scale was comparable with the nominal INOR-8&
analysis, but the molybdenum content was considerably higher. Scale x-ray
diffraction patterns could not be matched with known compounds. Since
the metallic content of the scale was less than 50% of the total weight, a

good possibility exists that the scale is an Ni-Mo-F complex,

Metallographic examination of the clip disclosed a soft (53-63
diamond-point hardness) spongy-surface layer and a subsurface layer of
variable hardness (115-335 DPH) as compared with a base INOR-8 value of
210 to 234 DPH (Fig. 10). Millings from the two layers were subjected
to spectrochemical analyses, with the results shown in Fig. 9. The spongy-
surface layer had approximately the same metallic composition as the scale
previously described. The subsurface layer was deficient in chromium, had
a slightly higher molybdenum content, and had the same iron content when

compared with the base metal.
3. FLUORINATOR CORROSION

As indicated in Fig. 1, after the fuel elements were dissolved in the
hydrofluorinator, the process salts, containing uranium as UF,, were trans-
ferred into the L nickel fluorinator, where the UF, was fluorinated to
the process product UFg. Process history for the current VPP fluorinator
is shown in Table 4. It should be noted that prior to exposure of the
vessel to fluoride salts the unit was fluorine-conditioned at temperatures
greater than subsequent operating temperatures, in accord with previous

studies. 18

3.1 Reaction to Environment

After run TU-7, the Mark III fluorinator was subjected to an ammonium
oxalate wash and then to several water rinses to remove process salts. The
fluorinator was examined by visual inspection, chemical analysis of wall’
deposits, complete gamma radiography of the fluorinator walls, and ultra-

sonic thickness measurements to determine corrosion.
3.1.1 Visual Inspection — Wall Deposit Chemistry

The interior of the fluorinator was inspected by means of the unaided

eye and the Omniscope. ? All interior areas which had been exposed to

process vapors were covered with relatively thick, light-green deposits.
The process vapors were usually F, and UFg plus volatile molybdenum and
chromium fluoride corrosion products, probably as MoFg and CrFs5. The
middle-neck region of the vessel, which joins the top and bottom right
cylinders, showed the heaviest deposits. Most of the deposits seemed to
be loosely adherent, and where the deposits had flaked off, the substrate
metal had a dark, dull appearance. Figure 11 illustrates these findings
in the upper conical section of the fluorinator. At higher magnification
evidence of pitting corrosion was found, especially in the top cylinder
of the vessel,

Samples collected from the deposits in the middle neck and in the
upper neck (top-flange region) were analyzed by wet chemistry and x-ray
diffraction. The latter indicated the deposits to be greater than O%
NiF,. Complete analyses of the deposits are shown in Table 5. The salt-
cortaining region of the fluorinator vas free of deposits and had a bright,

etched appearance.

cone of the vessel, and the attack seemed to be especially intensive in
the top and bottom third of the cylinder. The pits appeared to be slight-
ly deeper than those noted in the hydrofluorinator. With the 2% sensitiv-
ity factor for the radiographic technique taken into consideration, a
first approximation for the maximum pit depths was 10 mils.

Initial plans to wax replicate portions of the fluorinator for quan-
titative study of the pitting attack were abandoned to avoid the possibility

of metal ignition by reaction of traces of dental wax with fluorine.

3.1.3 Ultrasonic Thickness Measurements

 

- Wall thinning on the VPP fluorinator was determined by Vidigage meas-

‘urements taken every contour surface inch in each quadrant, and the results

were compared with base-line data. Figure 12 shows the bulk metal losses
found. Quadrant geometry did not appear to be significant in analyzing
the data, and so all data are presented at each elevation and the loss
ranges outlined.

Maximum fluorinator wall thinning of 27 mils occurred in the middle-

neck region which Joins the top and bottom 16-in. right cylinders. This

‘area was exposed essentially to process vapors. Average bulk metal losses

for- the salt, salt-vapor interface, and vapor regions were 5.5, 7, and
8 mils, respectively, while maximum wall-thickness losses for these regions

were two to three times the respective averages.

3.1.4 Nature of Fluorination Corrosion

 

Metallographic and dimensional changes on L nickel were followed dur-
ing the fluorination process runs by means of control specimens located in
the salt and interface regions and in the lower part of the vapor region
of the VPP fluorinator. This work will be reported in detail at a later
date. However, to complete this current evaluation of fluorination corro-
sion, a brief summary is included here.

The control specimens, 1/4-in.-diam rods 36 in. long, were held in
place by use of gas-tight metal connectors attached to short lengths of
nickel pipe, which were welded to the bottom head of the flucrinator. At

convenient intervals, dimensional and metallographic changes were noted
on the rods, which were then replaced by new specimens.

Summation of the dimensional losses on those portions of the corro-
sion rods exposed to the salt and interface regions compared favorably
with losses in the same regions on the fluorinator wall found by ultra-
sonic thickness measurements. However, no such correlation was noted for
the lower vapor region.

Metallographic examination of salt-region samples from the IL nickel
specimens disclosed spotty loss of grain boundary material and grain
boundary widening. Frequently, a few grains had sloughed off due to this
attack. A gray, semicontinuous film 0.1 to 0.5 mil thick was on the
surface of the samples, and the intergranular attack proceeded below this
film to a maximum depth of 1.5 mils. Similar results were noted for the
salt-vapor interface samples but to a much more moderate degree. Aside
from surface roughening and a thick continuous scale, no unusual effects
were noted for the vapor-region samples from the specimens. The vapor-
induced scale was considerably different in character from the films

noted on the salt and interface samples.
4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Corrosion rates on the VPP INOR-8 hydrofluorinator after 14 runs
appear to be consistent with previous ORNL developmental work on the
dissolution process, with the exception that the region of maximum attack
has shifted from the salt-vapor interface to the vapor region. Reasons
for this shift are not clear, particularly since the vapor-region tempera-
tures have been somewhat lower than those in the salt-containing region.
One possible reason for the losses in the lower-interface and salt-vapor
regions may be the protective nature of the higher concentration molybde-
num phase, compared with the base metal, produced at the INOR-8 surface-
hydrofluorination interaction region. This higher molybdenum phase is
believed to have formed as the result of previous process corrosion.
Another possibility — at least for the high attack in a localized vapor

region — is that barren salt impinged, during transfer, on the upper walls
—

- 30 -
of the hydrofluorinator. Rough calculations indicate that the barren-salt
hydrostatic head, plus nitrogen overpressure, is sufficient to cause salt
stream impingement on the opposite wall of the hydrofluorinator only a few
inches below the elevation of the barren-salt inlet.

Based on the 125-mil design corrosion allowance for the hydrofluori-~
nator, an average of 18 hr per dissolution run, and an admittedly question-
able linear extrapolation of the 0.06 mil/hr current corrosion rate, the
useful life of the VPP Mark I hydrofluorinator seems to be 116 runs.
Current corrosion rates for the VPP Mark IIT L nickel fluorinator and
the nature of attack on control specimens in the current vessel compare .
closely with corrosion experienced by the Mark I and II vessels? used in
the pilot plant. Also, the geometric location and the maximum losses for
the latest vessel, that is, the vapor region, match the Mark I major loss
area even though the vessels have different configurations.
Based on a corrosion rate of 1 mil/hr based on fluorine time and
assuming a corrosion allowance of 175 mils, a fluorine exposure time of
1.5 hr per run, and linear extrapolation, the VPP Mark IIT fluorinator -
should have a useful life of 117 runs to match the predicted life of the
nydrofluorinator. This calculation does not include intergranular or

other forms of selective attack.
