FOR RECOVERING URANIUM AND PLUTONIUM FROM SPENT UO, FUELS

ABSTRACT

Bench-scale experiments with uo, that had been irra-
diated to a burnup of 34,000 Mwd/metric ton and cooled for
two years were performed, using a 0.94-in.~-ID fluidized-
bed reactor. The objectives of these experiments were to
test NaF at 400°C for use as a trap for volatile fission
product fluorides, to test Mek, for use as a trap for nep-
tunium and technetium fluorides, to test Nal at 550°C for
use as a trap for sorbing Pu¥ and separating it from ru-
thenium, to study the behavior of neplunium, and to deter-

mine the fate of tritium.

In these studies the uo, was first oxidized with 20%
0,--80% N, at 450°C, to form U0g; this was then treated
with BrF-N, mixtures (5 to 10% BF) at 300°C to form
UF and volatilize the uranium and most of the ruthenium,
molybdenum, and technetium fluorides; finally, treatment
with fluorine at 300 to 500°C was used to fluorinate and
volatilize the plutonium as Pub. In some runs, BrF_ was

3

used for a final cleanup of uranium after the Brig treat-
ment. Plutonium was separated from the fluorine stream,
by irreversible sorption on NaF, in a trap at temperatures
above 500°C. Uranium hexafluoride was purified by passage
through a 400°C NaF bed and by sorption on, and desorption
from, Nak.

A ruthenium decontamination factor of 2000 was ob-
tained by using a 400°C NaF ted and a residence time of

15 sec; cosorpbion of ruthenium in the plutonium trap
was minimized by operating it at 550 to 600°C. Of the
syitium in the fuel, about 95% was liberated during the
heatup of Lhe Tuel to 450°C and during the oxidation; the

ocher 5% was liberated during the BrF_. step.

1. INTRODUCTION

Hot-cell tests of the fluldized-bed Tluoride volatility process
were made at Oak Ridge National Iaboratory in support of the proposed
Tuidized-Bed Volatility Pilot Plant.®* These studies were designed to
explore the chemical behavior of various fission products, using high-
burnup fuel, and to evaluate methods for decontaminating the uranium

and plutonium products. Specifically, we attempted to do the following:

1. test NaF at 400°C for its effectiveness in removing vclatile
fission products,

2. test Mek, at 100°C for use as a neptunium and technetium trap,

3. test Nal for use as a plutonium trap, particularly regarding
cosorption of ruthenium,

4. examine the behavior of neptunium, and

5. determine the fate of tritium.

The results of these tests and examinations, along with significant
observations made in the course of the work, are presented in this

report.

Acknowledgments. — The authors wish to recognize the fine work
dene by the Analytical Chemistry Division In the analysis of the hot
samples, and that of J. H. Goode for his analysis of the tritium znd
plutonium content of the fuel. We were assisted in the initial cold
testing of the equipment by T. E. Crabtree; the hot-cell work was

o

performed with the assistance of L. A. Byrd.

 

   

oign and construction efforts involving the Fluidized-Bed

ity Pilot Plant, which was scheduled for installation in

. 3019, were terminated in the fall of 1967 according tc a directive

2. EXPERIMENTAL

2.1 Equipment Used

Because space was limited the hot-cell tests were done with small
equipment. The fluidized-bed reactor, which was made of 1-in.-0D
nickel pipe, had a 2-in.-0D disengaging section. Except for the cold
trap and the NaF trap for plutonium sorption, the various traps con-

sisted of 1- or 2-in.-0D nickel tubes.

The fluidized-bed reactor is shown in Fig. 1. The bed was
supported in the reactor by a ball check valve. The temperature of
the fluidized section was monitored by an external thermocouple in a
well that was welded to the side of the reactor. Heat was supplied to
the fluldized-bed portion of the reactor by a clamshell heater. The
temperature of the disengaging section was monitored by an external
thermocouple. Calibration of this thermocouple against an internal
thermocouple indicated that the temperature of the gas in the disengaging
section was about 30°C higher than that of the wall. The disengaging
section was heated by means of a wrapping of asbestos-coated resistance
wire (Cerro Corp. "Rockbestos') thermally insulated with Ssuereisen.
The Tilter at the top of the disengaging section was periodically blown
back by a pulse of 5- to 10-psig nitrogen. The coaxial tube arrangement
shown in Fig. 1 created sufficient restriction in the flow out of the
bed to ensure that more than half of the blowback pulse passed through
the filter. This arrangement eliminated the use of valves, which were

known to require frequent maintenance.

Figure 2 shows the flange-filter assembly that was used on the
Fluidized-bed reactor and on all traps except the cold trap and the
NaF trap for plutonium. Tn this design, the Teflon O-ring acts to
seal the Tlanges and to seal in the filter. The presence of these
filters at the top of each trap prevented significant transfer of dust

between traps. The filters were replaced after each run.

The traps (except the cold trap and the plutonium trap) were

heated with resistance wire wrappings and were insulated with Sauereisen.

Standard Flange-Filter Assembly.
The bottom plates were recessed within the heated tubes to prevent a

4

temperature decrease at the bottom of the trap. In each of these traps,

t

he gas entered the trap at the botiom and exited at the top through a

flarge-Tilter assemuly.

The cold trap, which was used to collect the We product, consisted
of 2 6-in.-long, 2-in.-0D nickel tute fitted with a baffle that Torced
the gas to circulate to within 2 in. of the bottom. The trap was cooled

by immersion in dry ice-~trichlorocetiylene.

In the first four hot-cell tests, the plutonium trap consisted of
a straight tube having a thermocouple well that entered the side about
halfway down the tube; here, the two NaF beds were supported on each
side of The thermocouple well. The disadvantage of this type of trap
was the large temperature differential (50 to 100°C) across the section
of Nal on the gas inlet side. The NaF trap used to sorb plutonium in
the most recent tests is shown in Fig. 3. The double-wall design
resulted in a very small temperature gradient in the inner tube. Two
2.5-g portions of 12- to 20-mesh Nal’, separated by a plug of 3-mil
nickel wire, were inserted into this inner tube. The highest tempera-
ture cccurred at the bottom of the inner tube. The decreases in tem-
perature over the First and second sections were about 1°C and sbout
"°C, respectively. Thus, this trap could be operated with an essentially

constant sorption temperature; it was heated with a clamshell furnace.

Urheated 1/b-in.-0D Kel-F lines served to connect the Fluidized-
bed reactor, gas supplies, and the various traps. No valves were used

inside the cell except on the uranium product cold trap.

O7f-gas from the process was passed through the scrubber shown
in Fig. 4. The Brig and fluorine streams were scrubbed with 2 IN
KOH--C.2 N KI solution in 100% excess, znd the gss resulting from the

J

oxidation step was scrubbed with water. Representative camples of
the scrubber effluent were withdrawn automaticslly by means of the

colerncid valve and timer locsted at the bottom of the column.

pentafluoride gas was generalbed by beating a cylinder of liquid Be¥s to
about 50°C and passing it through tubing and differential pressure
transmitters heated above this temperature. Before entering the cell,
the Brf, gas was diluted with nitrogen to eliminate the necessity of
heating the lines inside the cell. Bromine trifluoride was produced

ah the inlet of the fluidized-bed reactor by mixing appropriate amounts
of bromine and BrF_. Bromine was generated by passing nitrogen through

5

s bromine bubbler maintained at 0°C.

2.2 Bampling Procedure

Sampling the solid traps, except the plutonium trap, was done by
passing the solids through a funnel with an inverted "Y" bottom until
a sample of convenient size (about 7 g except in the case of the
fluidized~-bed sample, which was 3.5 ¢) was obtained. Two samples from
each trap were submitted for analysis, snd the results were averaged.
The funnels used for this procedure were washed prior to the sampling
step; and, in esch run, the "coldest" traps were sampled first as a
further precaution against cross-contamination. Such sampling was
unnecessary for the plutonium trap since each section of the trap

contained only about 2.5 g

The filter of the fluidized-bed reactor was leached after each
run with 100 ml of 2 N A1L(MO,)
was submitted for analysis. The UF oroduct in the cold trap was
hydrolyzed with 200 to 250 ml of 1 J 41(mo,) 3°

started at either 30°C or —80°C, and then the temperature was increased

solution, and a sample of the leachate

This hydrolysis was

to 100°C for about 30 min. A more complete recovery of the uranium
in the solution was achieved when hydrolysis was begun at 30°C. A
sample of the resulting solution and a sample of a water rinse of the

cold trap was submitted for analysis.

Samples of the scrub solutions were also submitted for analysis.
10

2.3 Experimental Materials

All metal vessels, except the scrubber, were fabricated of nickel;

the scrubber was constructed of Alundum and stainless steel.

The heat-transfer medium in the fluidized-bed reactor consisted

of 50 g of 48- to 100-mesh Alcoa T-61 alumina.

The fuel charge, which consisted of about 3% g of uo, from the
Yankee reactor, had been irradiated to a burnup of about 34,000 Mwd,/
metric ton and cooled for two years. The estimated composition of
this fuel, as calculated by Merriman's program, 1 is given in Table 1.
In general, these values were used in the calculations presented in
this report. The isotopic analysis of the plutonium in this fuel, as

determined by mass spectrographic methods, is given in Table 2.

The NaF used in the traps (except the plutonium trap) consisted
of 1/8-1in. right circular cylinders obtained from the Harshaw Chemical
Company. In the plutonium trap, brcken pellets or fused NaF, 12 to 20

mesh in each case, were used.

Part of the Mer, used in the technetium-neptunium trap was
obtained from the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant; the remainder was

prepared at ORNL by fluorination of MgSO),
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Oxidation of Fuel

Before the start of the oxidation, the fuel was first heated to
450°C in fluidizing nitrogen. The oxidation treatment with 20 vol % 0,
in nitrogen lasted for 2 hr at 450°C and resulted in pulverization of
the fuel (see Fig. 5). During the heatup period and the oxidation, about
95% of the tritium was evolved.® The initial tritium content was deter-
mined by dissolving a 6-g batch of fuel in nitric acid and analyzing
the solution and off-gas for tritium;® the amount of tritium remaining
after oxidation wag determined similarly. No significant amounts of
other materials, except the rare gases (which were not determined),

escaped Irom the fluidized-bed reactor.

3.2 Volatilization of Uranium with BrF

The uranium volatilization step is shown in Fig. 6. In this
step, which was carried out at 300°C, the treatment typically consisted
of exposure to 5 vol % Brrr for 1 hr, 10% Brig for 2 hr, and 5% Brig

for 0.5 hr; in each case, the Brig or Br, was diluted with nitrogen.
After the gas containing the volatile fission product fluorides, UF,
bromine, and bromine fluorides leaves the fluidized-bed reactor, it
enters the bottom of the CRP (complexable reaction products) trap,

where 1t 1s mixed with excess fluorine to convert the bromine to Bri.
This prevents loss of uranium in the CRP trap via formation of non-
volatile UF complexes. In our experiments, an average of about 0.02%
of the uranium was found in the CRP trap. Most of the volatile fission
product fluorides are removed in this trap. The gas then passes through
the uranium sorption traps where uranium, technetium, and some molybdenum
are sorbed. Finally, the gas is routed to the scrubber, where the

fluorine and bromine flucrides are contacted with KOH-KI solution.

Treatment with Bry, for a brief period at the end of the uranium

volatilization step has been found to be desirable for the cleanup of

step (subsequent to BF -Br¥

about 3% (~ 960 mg) of the uranium charge was left in the fluidized-bed

reactor. However, when a 0.5-hr treatment with 5% Brig in N, was used,
about 80% of this residual uranium was removed. The utility of Brig

lies in ite abllity to fluorinate uranium at a lower temperatures than
Bry thereby allowing cleanup of the disengaging system, filter, and

2 3

lines. Bromine trifluoride also leaves less uranium on the alumina.
The very high point at 3 hr exposure is probably due to an experimental

error or some analytical error.

Since ruthenium Fluoride was the major, high-activity, volatile
fission product fluoride present in our experiments, 1t was studied more
extensively than the other fission product fluorides. Figure 8 is a
semilogarithmic plot showing the amount of ruthenium that was volatilized
during the fluorine treatment vs the equivalent number of liters of

BrF_. passed through the bed during the uranium volatilization step.

s a first-order reaction with respect to the amount of ruthenium
remaining in the luidized bed. This is seen to be approximately true.
The importance of these data lies in the information they provide con-
cerning the handling of a plutonium stream containing ruthenium. It
would be advantageous Tor the ruthenium to be volatilized with the
uranium. In our experiments, about 90% of the ruthenium was volatilized
with 6.7 liters of Br¥g; this required 33 min of treatment with 10 vol %

BrF_ in nitrogen. For every additional 33-min period of BrF_. treatment,

the ruthenium DF was increased by a factor of 10.

tested, the ruthenium activity reached its maximum very rapidly (see
Tig. 9). With Bf, an Iditial rapid increase was Tollowed by a slow
linear increase. A likely explanation for the slow linear increase

is the transpiration of a compound having a relatively low volatility.
Assuming that this compound is Ruf The results indicate that the
temperature of transpiration is about 55°C using the reported” vapor
pressure of Ruf and knowing the weight of ruthenium being picked up
by the trap. This temperature corresponds to that of the line between
the fluldized-bed reactor snd the CHP trap, and indicates that the Ruf
is deposited there. These indications were confirmed by serious radia-
tion damage to this line and by radiochemical analysis, which showed
that, at the end of the volatilization step, about 20% of the total
ruthenium could be found on the inside of the line. Visual observation
showed that the line used during the all-Tluorine test was only slightly
discolored, indicating that only a small guanbtity of ruthenium was
deposited in it. Therefore, it seems likely that treatment with Br¥
produces a greater quantity of low-volatility ruthenium compounds than

Tluorine treatment does.

Fission product DF's for the CRP trap are listed in Table 3. In
the first "hot" run (run 3) the DF's (except for cesium) were each
about 2000. These values are quite high, considering that the residence

time for the gas in contact with the 400°C NaF was only about 2.5 sec.

Tn later runs, despite the sampling precautions mentioned earlier, the
DF''s decreased significantly. The most likely explanation for the
lower values is cross-contamination since all of the higher DF's
decreased to about the same level. We believe that the DF's from the
first hot run (No. 3) are "true" values (i.e., they are the values that

could be expected in the absence of cross-contamination).

One undesirable result of the Brig treatment was the small amount
of plutonium found in the CRP trap in each run. Table 4 compares the
percentage of the total plutonium found on this trap with the percentage
of the total Pg found there. It was felt that these quantities should
be about equal since neither plutonium nor Pr is expected to be

volatilized by BrF
90

5° Surprisingly, the loss of plutonium is about ten
times that of Sr; one possible explanation for this is that the PuF),
particles are considerably smaller than the STF, particles and are,
consequently, preferentially blown through the filter. The presence

of plutonium in the CRP trap was confirmed by differential pulse-height

analysis.

3.3 Desorption of Uranium

Desorption of the uranium was accomplished by connecting the main
uranivie sorption trap (T2) to a 400°C NaP polishing trap (Th), a 100°C
MgF,, trap (15), and a cold trap cooled to —80°C. This arrangement is
shown in Fig. 10. Fluorine was passed through the traps at the rate
of about 100 ml/min. Reliable values for the fission product DF's for
the sorption-desorption are not available because of the small quantities
of fission products present and because of the cross-contamination prob-
lem mentioned previously. However, overall fission product DF's for the
uranium product were obtained, and are listed in Table 5. It appears
that DF's of about 10° are easlly obtained for many contaminants with
this process. Molybdenum was partially removed by virtue of its tendency
not to cosorb with uranium during the BF, volatilization step. The
plutonium DF's are encouraging since they indicate that the uranium
product could be treated as plutonium~free material during subsequent
handling.

—

The technetium DF's for trap 5 are given in Table 6. Four-mesh
MgF, from the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant was used in the traps
for runs 3 and &. In run 5, we used 12- to 20-mesh material that had
been prepared at ORNL by fluorinating MgSO, The smaller particles
gave much better results, probably because of their greater external

surface area. Contact time was about 15 sec.

The overall uranium material balances (see Table 7) were not
satisfactory in all cases. Data in the table suggest that the
difficulty may be caused by starting the hydrolysis at a low temperature,
The explanation for the uniformly low material balances, except in the

% 1

case of run 5, is not known.

3.4 Volatilization of Puff, with Fluorine
4

In the plutonium volatilization step, the fluidized bed was
treated with elemental fluorine, as shown in Fig. 11, to form volatile
PuFy. In the cold tests and in the first two hot tests (runs 3 and L),

fluorination was started at 300°C. After sintering and actual ignition

of the alumina occurred in runs 3 and U4, respectively, conditions for
this step were modified. In the later tests, fluorination was begun

at about 200°C, with the fluorine concentration (in nitrogen) programmed
from 10 to 50 vol %. The temperature was then increased to 300°C over
about a 30-min period; 50 vol % F, was used. Next, the fluorine concen-
tration was increased to 100% over a subsequent 30-min period. Finally,
the temperature was raised to 500°C over a l-hr period and maintained

at 500°C for 2 hr. The total fluorination program required 5 hr, of
which 3.5 hr was at a temperature of 300°C or greater. When this program

was followed, no sintering of the alumina was observed.

Plutonium is readily removed from the {fluorine stream by a very
small NaF trap. In our experiments, a 2.5-g NaF trap at 550°C sorbed
about 99.9% of the plutonium that reached it. The residence time for

the gas was only about 0.02 sec.

The major fission product that cosorbed with the plutonium was
ruthenium; after ruthenium, cesium was most important. The overall
ruthenium and cesium DF's are shown in Table 8. The cesium DF is
relatively high (about 104 and cesium could be easily separated from
the plutonium during its removal from the NaF (possibly by dissolution
of the NaF in anhydrous HF). Thus ruthenium is likely to be the most
troublesome. As was mentioned earlier in connection with the inter-

halogen Tlowsheet, the amount of ruthenium that is cosorbed with the

Ratios expected from the amount of ruthenium found and the differ-
ence in trap temperature: 0.306 (run 4) and 45 (run 6). (By Re’. 5)
plutonium can be easily reduced by extensive treatment of the fluidized
ted with Bri - Another method for reducing the amount of cosorbed
ruthenium would be to operate the plutonium sorption bed at a temperature
that is unfavorable for ruthenium sorption: for example, it is known

that ruthenium sorption on NaF decreases significantly at temperatures

5

above 500°C, However, in an experiment in which the NaF was heated
to about 615°C, severe sintering was observed; this was probably the
result of the formation of the Nak Pal) eutectic. Thus, 550°C seems
to be about the highest usable temperature. At 550°C, the ruthenium
DF (6.0) achieved in the plutonium trap was four times that obtained
at 325°C (1.5). Thus, for plutonium decontemination the best recom-
mendation is to fluorinaste for a fairly long period of time with

BrF_ and to operate the plutonium trap at about 550°C.

Plutonium material balances were not uniformly good (see Table 9).
In run 1, which was a "cold" run, the exact plutonium content (262 mg)
was known. A 93% material balance is considered acceptable Tor this
quantity of plutonium. However, material balances for runs 3 and Lb are
poor. No material balance is available for run 5 because the plutonium

trap was lost. Material balances for runs 6 and 7 are quite satisfactory.

All-¥luorine Flowsheet

 

An alternative to the interhalogen flowsheet 1s the ali-fluorine
flowsheet in which both the uranium and plutoniup are volatilized, as
Uk, and Puf, by using fluorine. Tn one possible version of this flow-
sheet the plutonium is removed from the fluorine stream by a small high-
temperature NaF trap located immedistely behind the fluidized~bed
reactor. The remaining gas passes through the traps for the uranium

volatilization step, as discussed previously.

In the hot-cell test of this Tlowsheet, the plutonium trap was
operated at about 620°C. Unfortunately, before the run was completed,
this trap plugged, apparently due to the Tormation of a molten NeF-PuF)
eutectic salt. At this point only about 35% of the plutonium had been
volatilized; about two-thirds of the 0 Ru and z2lmost all the uranium
had been volatilized when the run was terminated. Based on this partial

run, we can make the following statements:

(1) A more effective decontamination of plutonium from ruthenium
was achieved than was expected. .

(2) An overall ruthenium DF of 249 was obtained; about 200 of
this value is attributable to nonsorption of ruthenium in
the plutonium trap.

(3) Routine operation of the trap at 620°C would probably be
difficult because of the plugging and sintering that would

be encountered.

A previous run using the interhalogen flowsheet with a plutonium trap
at about 550°C gave a 10680 DF of oaly about 4.0; whether the higher

DF in the all-fluorine case is the result of the presence of a larger
amount of ruthenium (about 60 mg as compared with about 0.6 mg) or to

the higher temperature is not known.
29

3.5 Recovery of Plutonium from NaF Trap

After the Pufg is collected on NaF, the plutonium must be recovered
from the complex that is formed. One possible method consists of aqueous
dissolution followed by lon exchange Treatment. Another method involves
dissolution of the NaF with anhydrous HF, leaving PuF) as an insoluble
residue; this treatment also gives a significant additional ruthenium
DF. The second method was tested with the plutonium trap from run 6.6
As a pretreatment the NaF was first fused in a platinium crucible at
about 1050°C. A ruthenium DF of about 2 was obtained as a result of
ruthenium plating on the crucible. [Use of a more~reactive crucible
(e.g., nickel) would probably have given a higher DF.] When the NaF
was dissolved in anhydrous HF, an additional ruthenium IF of 2.6 was

obtained.
Lk, CONCLUSIONS

Based on the hot~-cell work, the fluidized-bed volatility process
appears to be chemically feasible. Care must be exercised at the
start of the fluorination step to prevent sintering of the alumina
bed. larger equipment would probably present an even greater problem
in this respect since the heat transfer would be less effective.
Ruthenium contamination of the uranium product should be low since
ruthenium DF's of about 10° vere found in the hot-cell experiments.
Ruthenium contamination of the plutonium product can be reduced by
removing most of the ruthenium with the uranium during the Br¥,
treatment. A more effective separation of plutonium and ruthenium
is achieved by operating the plutonium trap at about 550 to 580°C
(instead of at 325°C).
