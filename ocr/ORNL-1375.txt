ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

FOREWORD

The Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Project is comprised of some 300 technical
and scientific personnel engaged in many phases of research directed toward the
nuclear prepulsion of aircraft. A considerable portion of this research is
performed in support of other organizations participating in the national ANP
effort. However, the bulk of the ANP research at ORNIl. is directed toward the
development of a circulating-fuel type of reactor. The nucleus of this effort
is now centered upon the Aircraft Reactor Experiment - a 3-megawatt high-
temperature prototype of a circulating-fuel reactor for the propulsion of
aircraft.

This quarterly progress report of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Project at
ORNL records the technical progress of the research on the circulating-fuel
reactor and all other ANP research at the laboratory under its Contract W-7405-
eng-26. The report 1s divided into four parts: I. Reactor Theory and Design;
IT, Shielding Research; ITI. Materials Research; and IV. Appendixes. Each
part has a separate Summary and Introduction.

 
 

 

 

 
 
SUMMARY AND

The over-all concept and design of
the Aircraft Reactor Experiment were
set forth in the two preceding re-~
ports. The most significant modifi-
cations during the past quarter have
been those attendant to the specifi-
cation of NaK as the reflector coolant
and the NaF-ZrF, -UF, mixture as the
circulating fuel. Most of the equip-
ment for the experiment is now on order
and some has already been received and
installed in the ARE Building. The
safety aspects of the reactor are being
analyzed, particularly, the off-gas
disposal system and the effect of a
postulated ‘fuel~tube rupture (sec. 1).

Valves, pumps, and instrumentation
for the fluid circuit of the Aircraft
Reactor Experiment are being developed
{sec. 2), Valves with both bellows
seals and packed seals have been suc
cessfully used with molten fluorides,
but the bellows seal appears to be the
more reliable. Water tests with the
maintained-level gas-sealed pump pro-
posed for the ARE have been unsatis-
factory. Since the packed seal 1s
satisfactory when the back end is
maintained at temperatures below the
fluoride melting point, a pump 1in-
corporating this seal has been specified
for the ARE. Instrumentation for the
ARE fluid circuits must be designed so
as to be unaffected by the high vola-
tility and subsequent condensate of
the ZrF,-containing fuel, Accordingly,
flowmeters, pressure~-measurement

INTRODUCTION

devices, and fluid-level indicators
and controls are being redesigned and
tested for this application, Data from
the NaK-to-air radiator tests corres-
pond exceptionally well with theoreti-
cal values. A hydrodynamic mockup of
the ARE core has served te illustrate
the problems associated with fuel
loading and draining. Also of signifi-
cance to the ARE is an experiment in
which a fuel-tube rupture is simulated
so that NaK (the reflector coolant) is
injected into the fuel stream.

Theoretical investigations of the
kinetics of the circulating-fuel
reactor indicate that all subsequent
oscillations will be moderate if the
survives the first, short,
The applicability
of multigroup calculations to reactors
with vastly different core and re-
flector materials is uncertain pending
critical experiments. An improved
method of computing the effects of
gaps on reactivity has been developed

(sec. 3).

reactor
Maximum eXCursionh.

The recent experiments on the
critical assembly of the General
Electric air-cooled water-moderated
reactor {R~1) have included reflector
studies and poison-rod calibrations.
The preliminary assembly of the circu-
lating-fuel reactor for the ARE has
been critical with a uranium mass in

excellent agreement with that pre-

1. CIRCULATING-FUEL AIRCRAFT REACTOR EXPERIMENT

E. S. Bettis

R. W. Schroeder

ANP Division

The main core design and the general
concept of the circulating-fuel air-
craft experiment are essentially the
same as reported in the preceding
quarterly report.¢!) The few changes
made in the design and in the in-
strumentation were necessary because
of certain fuel characteristics; the
most probable fuel (NaF-ZrF,-UF,) has
higher vapor pressure and higher
viscosity than expected, and some
fluid-circuit design characteristics
have had to be altered accordingly.
NaK has been selected as the reflector
coolant after an examination of the
hazards introduced by a postulated
fuel-tube rupture. Although a fuel-
tube plug would almost certainly
result if the rupture were large,
studies on the simulator indicate that
the reactor could be safely scrammed
and drained. The off-gas system in-
corporating a vapor trap and a low-
temperature carbon absorber unit is
being designed. Final drawings of the
reactor assembly and fluid-circuit flow
sheet are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. A
detailed description and design draw-
ings of the ARE were published in the
ARE status report. (?)

FLUID CIRCUIT
G. A, Cristy, ANP Division

Some problems have arisen regarding
the design of the fluid circuit as a
result of the high viscosity of the
NaF-ZrF,-UF, fuel. Since the viscosity
of this circulating-fuel mixture is

twice as high as originally anticipated,
it caused a reduction of one-half in
the Reynold’s number within the heat
exchanger tube system, that is, from
approximately 8000 to approximately
4000, This, in turn, has caused a
reduction in the tube-side heat-
transfer coefficient, such that the
calculated minimum film temperatures
are in the vicinity of the freezing
point of the fuel mixture (940°F).
In order to re-establish the minimum
film temperature sufficiently above the
freezing point, two major changes were
made. First, the operating temperature
range was raised from between 1150 and
1500°F to between 1200 and 1500°F,
which increased the flow rate by a
factor of 7/6 and increased the minimum
bulk fuel temperature by 50°F, Also,
the heat exchanger tube arrangement
was modified. In contrast to the
previous arrangement with five tubes
in parallel, the present arrangement
has all the fluid passing through two
tubes in parallel and thence through
a second bank of three tubes in
parallel, By incorporating these two
changes, the minimum calculated film
temperature was increased to about
1050°F. The changes also increased
the system pressure drop and the
pressure level within the pressure
shell, The consequences of these
differences are discussed in the
following section.

The gas-sealed pump originally
designed for use with Na or NaK has
been found to be unusable for fluoride
circulation without extensive modifi-
cation of the seal. Since the surge
tank design is intimately related to
that of the pump, details on the surge
tank will not be released prior to
resolution of the pump problem. All
other details of the fluid circuits

of 1150°F this gives a creep rate of
about 1% in 10,000 hr and a factor of
safety of 1.6 based on stress-rupture
in 1000 hours. By plate reinforcing,
the maximum bending stresses are
reduced to 6000 psi. This is slightly
less than the stress for a creep rate
of 0,10% in 10,000 hours. As stated
in the previous report, all holes that

With added reinforcing, the stresses
in the side walls have also been
reduced to a maximum axial stress in
the cylinder of about 6000 psi. With-
out added reinforcing, the stress at

side walls give a creep rate somewhat
in excess of 0.10% in 10,000 hr and a

REFLECTOR COOLANT
E. 5. Bettis, ANP Division

The fuel-carrier NaF-ZrF, was
originally considered as the most
probable choice for the reflector
coolant, However, recent dynamic
tests of the corrosion of the beryllium
oxide reflector by a similar fluoride
mixture, NaF-KF-ZrF,, showed that the
beryllium oxide was dissolved to an
extent that would prohibit the use of
that fluoride as a reflector coolant,

Two alternative secondary coolants
have been considered: NaK and the
fluoride eutectic NaF-BeF,. The choice
between these two coolants resolves to
an analysis of the hazards attendant
to a fuel-tube rupture that would
connect the fuel and reflector-coolant
circuits, Although it is unlikely that
a rupture will occur and allow the
coolant to leak into the core, the
possibility of such a leak must be

admitted. Furthermore, 1f such a leak
does occur, the reactor must and will
be shut down no matter what reflector

coolant is used.

The fluoride eutectic NaF-BeF, has
acceptable physical characteristics
and is compatible with beth the
beryllium oxide reflector-moderator
and the fluoride fuel. An objection
to the use of this coolant is the
expense and time involved in producing
a sufficient quantity for the ABE.
Another objection, which would not be
present if NaK were used, emerges from
the consequences of a fuel-tube leak.
With the relatively inert NaF-BeF,
mixture as the reflector coolant, in
the case of a fuel-tube leak there is
the possibility that sufficient fuel
could seep into the moderator inter-

stices to overcome all control rod
effects.
NaK, however, is known to reduce

fluorides such as ZrF, and UF, to
lower valence states of the metal.
Since these reduced compounds have
higher melting points than the original
material, a fuel-tube plug could
readily occur. That this would
actually. happen with a sufficiently
large rupture has been demonstrated
experimentally (cf., sec. 2, “Experi-
mental Engineering’’).

The reactor system simulator was
used to study the effect of a leak of
NaK into the fuel channel of such
magnitude that the channel is com-
pletely plugged. When this occurs the
temperature of the plugged fuel passage
begins to rise at a rate of about
36°F/sec and will rise to an asymptotic
value of about BOO°F above the fuel
temperature at the time of the plug-
ging. This condition obtains by the
temperature coefficient alone 1f no
control rod correction is employed.
When the plugged tube begins to heat
the reactor goes on a 25-sec negative
period. The outlet temperature of the

11
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

five unplugged passages drops at the
rate of about 15°F per second. This
drop in temperature of five out of six
outlet fuel tubes provides a unique
symptom of plugging that will enable
the reactor to be shut down by scram-
ming and subsequent draining of fuel.

Since there appears to be some
additional safety to be realized from
the use of NaK and NaK has the most
favorable physical properties of the
coolants considered, it will be used
as the reflector coolant in the ARE.
The secondary heat exchanger and
associated gear are being designed for
use with this coolant,

INSTRUMENTATION

S. A. Hluchan, Instrument Department

Some ARE instrumentation has had to
be modified because of the high vapor
pressure of the ZrF, component of the
fuel mixture, Sufficient ZrF, con-
densate would accumulate in the gas
space above the hot liquid to com-
pletely clog the open instrument lines
in a few hours if the liquid tempera-
ture was around 1200°F., Consequently,
the instrument lines previously
contemplated for use in measuring
liquid level, pressure, and liquid
flow had to be replaced by devices
with no open lines. Bellows were
substituted as pressure indicators and
a fluid-immersed inductance type of
instrument was substituted for measur-
ing flowand liquid level. A discussion
of these instruments appears in the
‘Experimental Engineering’ section of
this report (sec. 2).

OFF- GAS SYSTEM
T. Roseberry, ANP Division
A carbon absorber unit at liquid

nitrogen temperature is being used to

completely remove the fission gas

12

(Br,, TI,, Kr, Xe) from the helium
stream coming from the NaK vapor trap
before it is released to the stack.
The unit consists of four 4-im.-IPS
stainless steel tubes connected 1n
series by 2-in.,-IPS stainless steel
tubes. The first and second tubes
cool the gas stream and solidify the
Br, and I,, and the third and fourth
tubes, which contain approximately 700
in.? of 20-28 mesh CXA carbon, absorb
Kr and Xe.

With normal off-gassing (unit
designed for 10 ft®/hr; probably the
flow will be less and not continuous),
the carbon bed has a break-through time
of at least 800 hours. If it becomes
necessary to purify the helium atmos-
phere in the heat exchanger pit be-
cause of a hot leak, each of the two
units can take a flow rate of 100
ft?/hr for at least 70 hours.

The break-through time of the unit
was obtained as follows: (3)

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1952

various components of the ARE are being
studied. To date nothing untoward has
been brought to light.

The servicing of equipment in the
heat exchanger room will be governed
more by radiation that comes directly
from activated equipment and fission-
product deposition than that which
comes through the concrete wall from
the fuel dump tank or the shut-down
reactor. The rate of deposition and
the retention of fission products on
Inconel surfaces are not readily pre-
dictable, except by experiment. It
would appear that satisfactory removal
of fission products may be possible 1f
methods analogous to those for the
decontamination of solid-fuel process-
ing equipment were used.

An upper limit to the activation of
the Inconel by thermealized delayed
neutrons has been calculated by assum-
ing all are captured in the Inconel.

The cold trap in the helium scrubber
system is being investigated for the
heat generation caused by the retention
of radioactive xenon and krypton on
the activated carbon.

H. W. Savage,

Continued emphasis by the ex-
perimental engineering group on the
development of components for high-
temperature fluid-circulating systems
has resulted in improvements in pumps,
valves, seals, and instruments such as
those for indicating and controlling
liquid levels, measuring system
pressures, and measuring flow rates.

Valves for use in high-temperature
fluid systems, such as the ARE, must

EXPERIMENTAL REACTOR ENGINEERING

ANP Division

operate with complete reliability for
long periods over a temperature range
of from 1200 te 1500°F. The stem
seal is considered the most critical
problem in the operation of valves at
high temperatures; conventional sealing
materials are inadequate. Consequently,
the major effort of the valve program
has been on seal development, and
progress has been made in sealing
valves with both Inconel bellows seals
and stuffing-box seals packed with

13
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

Inconel braid and graphite and nickel
powders. Some time has been spent,
also, in considering several valve
configurations and in determining
whether self-welding of valve seating
materials may be encountered in the
presence of the ARE fuel at operating

temperatures.

Seals are also the critical problem
in pumps. Gas seals, packed seals,
frozen seals, and combination packed
and frozen seals have been tested with
varying degrees of success. The
combination of packed and frozen seals
appears to furnish the most positive
sealing action against high-temperature
fluoride fuel mixtures. The hydro-
dynamic tests of the first model
(Model DA) of the ARE pump, with water
as the circulated fluid, indicated
that the pump sealing arrangement had
to be modified. Two avenues of
modification were then open: a sump
type of pump could be used in which
the fluid 1s not in contact with the
shaft seal but 1s separated by an
inert gas volume,or a
packed and frozen seal could be used.
The latter was selected for use in

the ARE.

combination

Heat transfer tests have continued
with sodium-to-air radiators with
varying fin spacing. The test results
correlate with the changes in fin
spacing made 1n the radiator configu-
rations tested and are in excellent
agreement with the theoretical heat
transfer. A test loop is near com-
pletion to make measurements of over-
all heat transfer coefficients of
fluorides to liquid metals.

Instrumentation for the ARE cannot
incorporate gas-sensing lines that
contact the liquid fluoride surface
because of the high-vapor pressure of
the zirconium fluoride. Accordingly,
flowmeters, pressure-measuring devices,
and fluid-level indicators and controls
are being designed with closed liquid

14

surfaces. Two types of high-tempera-
ture fluid flowmeters are being
developed. A rotameter type of
flowmeter incorporating a tapered iron
core and an induction coil as the
sensing element 1s being tested. A
rotating-vane flowmeter that uses a
permanent magnet and a pick-up coil
as the sensing element is being
prepared for test. Several pressure-
measuring devices are being developed.
These are divided into two general
types in which the sensing element,
either bellows or diaphragm, operates
in a cooled, trapped-gas volume or is
completely submerged in the high-
temperature fluid. A float type of
level indicator and controller that
uses a tapered iron core and induction
coil to sense and control levels has
been developed that will reliably main-
tain two levels within 0.1 in. of each
other when used in connection with a
venturi for flow measurement. Other
level indicators also being
developed.

are

Hydrodynamic tests have been con-
ducted with a glass mockup of the
ARE core. With 45-gpm flow it was
demonstrated that the system could be
filled with certainty when evacuated
to a pressure of 28 in. Hg, but under
no circumstances can all the fluid
be removed from the core structure.
Later tests indicate that with 50-gpm
flow,vacuum is not required for com-
plete filling.

A possible reactor header ar-
rangement has been developed that
gives an optimum flow pattern through
a reactor core that has single-pass,
parallel fuel tubes. This
greatly reduces the amount of stagnant
fuel that would be held up in the
header as compared with that held up
in the conventional plenum chamber.

design

The technology of fluoride handling
has progressed. Fuel production
equipment capable of meeting current
FOR

fuel needs 1s in operation. The
equipment for producing the ARE fuel
and moderator coolant is being designed.
Methods have been developed for
cleaning fluoride-contaminated systems
with high-pressure steam jets.

Tests were conducted in an attempt
to determine whether a plug of solid
fluoride fuel mixture could be remelted
in the ARE core-tube bends without
rupturing the tubes. Repeated cycles
of increasing severity failed to
rupture the tube under test, but a
slight swelling was noted in the bend
at the conclusion of the experiment,

Fuel-flow stoppage resulted when
rapid additions of NaK, which is one
of the proposed ARE moderator-coolants,
were made to a stream of fuel, NaF-
ZrF,-UF,, at 1500°F in a small, forced-
circulation loop. This test simulated
a large fuel tube rupture that, if
developed in the ARE fuel tubes, would
permit the moderator coolant to leak
into the fuel system.

The vapor pressure of NaF-ZrF,-UF,
(46.0-50.0-4.0mole %) is high compared
with other fuel mixtures considered,
and at ARE operating temperatures some
Zr¥, is sublimed from any free sur-
faces. This sublimed material plugs
cool control-gas lines in dynamic
fluid systems and makes their operation
difficult. The vapor pressure problem
with this fuel 1s being studied, and
equipment that may alleviate the
problem is being developed.

after more than 4000 hr of pumping
sodium at temperatures from 800 to
1200°F. During the major portion
of the test the sodium temperature
at the pump was approximately 1100°F.
A weld failure and a simultaneous
flange failure in the test loop caused
the termination of the test.

Shaft speed during the greater part
of the test was 2000 rpm. Pump
operation was smooth during the test
except for a short period during which
there was interference between the
impeller and the pump housing. An
inspection of the pump shaft after
disassembly showed the shaft to be in
excellent condition except for a
build-up of nickel on the shaft at the
solid sodium-liquid interface. The
build-up of nickel was caused by mass
transfer from the nickel sealing ring
at the parting faces to the cold
region of the seal. Although this
build-up caused no operational diffi-
culty, it indicates that nickel will
not be entirely satisfactory for use
as a sealing gasket for parting faces
for high~temperature pumps that are
to be operated for extended periods.

The loop is to be disassembled for
complete examination and oxygen
analysis of the sodium in the system
and in the cold stub‘ that was placed
in the loop for trapping oxides from
the system.

Durce Frozen-Fluoride-Sealed Punmp
(W. B. McDonald, W. G. Cobb, P. G.
Smith, ANP Division). The Durco
centrifugal pump (Model H34MDVX-80)
incorporating an improved design of
the frozen~fluoride seal has been
constructed and is being assembled
into a test loop. Previous tests of a
frozen-fluoride seal on a similar
pump, which operated for over 500 hr
at 1200°F, indicated that such a seal
will furnish a positive sealing action
against high-temperature fluorides.
Failure occurred at the parting-face

15
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

seal and some scoring of the shaft
occurred in the sealing area.

The operational characteristics of
the seal are considered to be the most
perplexing problem encountered. The
pump in the first test could not be
stopped for periods longer than 5 min
without considerable difficulty in
restarting. Upon stopping, the frozen
fluorides in the seal bonded the shaft
tightly to the sleeve and it was
necessary to apply sufficient heat to
melt the fluorides before operation
could be resumed. The improved design
incorporates a 2000-watt Calrod heater
by means of which the heat input for
melting of the fluorides in the seal
can be carefully controlled so that
the pump can be more easily restarted
after shutdown. The cooling fins on
this seal are baffled so that the air
flow across these seals can be ac-
curately controlled. This degree of
close control over the temperature at
which the seal is operated should
enable a better determination of its
optimum operating conditions. The
shaft for this pump is coated with
Stellite No. 3, which is harder than
the Stellite No. 6 used in the previous
test, to reduce shaft wear and scoring.

The weakest point of the pump is
the high-compression sealing joint at
the parting faces; nevertheless, it
is expected that this pump can be
operated with the fluoride temperature
approaching 1500°F.

redesign consisted of the following
modifications:

1. The ring-joint parting- face
seal was moved from the region in
which it was in contact with high-
temperature fluorides to a higher
position where it now seals against
helium only.

2. Heat-radiation baffles were
placed between the high-temperature
liquid-gas interface and the top
flange of the pump.

3. The stuffing-box shaft seal was
replaced by a carbon-ring hardened-
tool-steel face seal.

The fluoride fuel NaF-ZrF,-UF, has
been pumped for over 250 hr at 1200°F
with this pump. The flow rate is
approximately 10 gpm, the shaft speed
is 2500 rpm, and a 16-~ft head of fluid
is developed. Some operational diffi-
culties have been experienced which,
although not severe, indicate that
some further minor design changes are
needed. Turbulence of the free liquid
surface in the pump is rather violent
and prevents true level indication by
the spark-plug probes. The shaft
speed is limited to between 2500 to
3000 rpm because of this disturbance.
Some oil leakage has occurred from the
bearing housing past the carbon-ring
face seal and/or the *0”-ring oil
seal into the oil catch basin im-
mediately below. Although this basin
is drained continuously and no oil is
permitted to drain into the fluorides,
the system is probably contaminated
by o1l vapors. The extent of this
contamination will be determined when
the pump 1s shut down and analysis of
the fluorides made. With only the
above difficulties, which are not
considered to be serious,
continues to operate very smoothly
and its success to date is very en-
couraging.

(W. BR. Huntley, P. WW. Taylor, H. RH.
Johnson, ANP Division). Although
packed seals that will operate satis-
facterily have been developed for
high-temperature pump shafts, such
seals must either be tightened at all
times to the point where shaft wear is
likely to result or maintained at a
temperature below the freezing point
of the circulated fluid. During the
operation of a standard Durco pump
that was modified to incorporate a
stuffing-box seal packed with Inconel
braid and nickel and graphite powders,
it was found that the pump could be
operated for long periods with zero
leakage of the stuffing-box seal only
when the back end of the seal was
permitted to operate at a temperature
below the melting point of the fluid
pumped. When only the metallic packing
is at a temperature above the melting
point of the fluid, a small amount of
fluid penetrates the packing into the
cold region near the compression
member, where it freezes to seal the
pump (leakage rate approximately 1 g
of solid material in 24 hr). This
pump has operated for 450 hr, pumping
the fluoride fuel NaF-Zr¥, -UF, at
temperatures from 1150°F to 1300°F.
The flow rate is 16 gpm, and an ap-
proximately 35-ft fluid head is de-
veloped at a shaft speed of 1500 rpm.

This sealing method was derived
because when the entire stuffing box,
including the compression member, was
heated to a temperature substantially
above the melting point of the fluid,
considerable leakage at a rapid rate
resulted. When the heat source was
removed from the back end of the seal,
the leakage immediately stopped and
the pump continued to operate smoothly
without leakage.

(Operation of this Durco pump with
shaft packingis smoother than operation

“of the Durco pump with the frozen
"seal.

When the pump operating power

is measured, power surges of ap-
proximately 0.5 kw and about 1/2-min
duration are found to occur at intervals
of 2 to:-3 minutes. Similar power
surges occurred in operation with the
frozen seal that contained no packing,
but they were greater in magnitude
because of the longer frozen section.

The amount of wear on the shaft,
which is hard-surfaced with Stellite,
cannot be determined until] the pump
is shut down for examination; however,
the pump operation is sufficiently
smooth te indicate that the shaft
wear may not be severe. Two lubricants
(tricresyl phosphate-molybdenum
disulphide mixture and lead berate
glass) have been introduced into
the seal in an attempt to eliminate
the power surges. Either lubricant
reduces the amplitude of the power
surges temporarily but does not reduce
their frequency.

ARE Centrifugal Pump (W. G. Cobb,
A. G. Grindell, G. D. Whitman, ANP
Division). The Model DA gas-sealed
pump originally designed for the ARE
has undergone hydraulic tests ia a
closed loop with water as the circu-
lated fluid. As designed, a combination
surge tank, de-gasser, and pump fluid-
level control has been placed in the
loop at the pump discharge. Figure 3
shows a schematic outline of this
circuit. The tank carries full {flow
and in addition is connected to the
pump with liquid and gasequalizer
lines. The liquid connection leads
from the bottom of the surge tank,
enters the pump above the impeller
housing, and feeds a narrow, annular
volume surrounding the shaft to form
a liquid seal for the impeller shaft.
The gas equalizer interconnects the
two gas volumes in the pump and surge
tank.

Successful pumping has not been
obtained except when the gas equalizer
is valved shut. With this inter-
connecting line open as designed, the

Either overfilling or gassing would
result in flow stoppage if the fluid
involved was a fluoride.

Although it may be possible to
render perturbations of this type
harmless by some combination of
stationary vanes in part of the
annulus, by increased flow (or de-
creased head loss) from the surge
tank through the liquid equalizer
line, or by packing dampers in the
annulus, the development work required
appears to be considerable. In view
of the requirements of the ARE for
high mechanical certainty of operation
and the progress on packed seals,
further development work on the
Model DA pump has been postponed
indefinitely.

Modifications for using the same
impeller and housing in both the sump
type of pump and packed-seal pump are
being carried out,

VALVES

Bellows Type of V¥alve-Stem Seal
(Pp. W. Taylor, ANP Division). One of
the most promising valve-stem seals
appears to be that constructed of
three-ply Inconel bellows, each ply
in the bellows being approximately
0.009 in. thick. Results of tests of
two such bellows have been so highly
satisfactory that this type of seal
has been incorporated in the design
of 1 1/2-in. throttling valves for
use in the ARE system and in pump
test loops.

One test was terminated for ex-
amination of the bellows after operation
for 1000 hr submerged in a bath of
fluorides at 1500°F., The bellows was
cycled once each 12 hr through its
maximum rated travel of 9/32 inch.
Upon examination it was found that
only the first ply of the bellows has
been penetrated by the fluorides. A

1952

second such bellows has been operated
under similar conditions for over
1600 hr with no indication of failure.
This bellows has been cycled 127 times
during the test, which will continue
until failure.

High-Temperature Yalve-Stem Packings
(D. BR. Ward, H. BR, Johnson, ANP
Division; R. N. Mason, Engineering and
Maintenance Division). A program for
investigating high-temperature valve-
stem packing materials is under way.
Considerable operating experience has
been accumulated with valves packed
with Incenel and graphite powder and
lubricated with tricresyl phosphate~
molybdenum disulfide mixture. Such
valves have proved quite successful
in laboratory operation; however, some
stem seizure has been encountered that
required heating of the valve bonnet
to free the stem, and in some instances
leakage of fluoride around the stem
has occurred. At the present time
reliability of a valve packed in this
manner is not completely assured for
long~time maintenance-free operation
with fluorides at 1200 to LS500°F.

It is pessible that powdered packing
materials that are not wetted by the
molten fluorides may give better stem
sealing and better valve operation. A
test apparatus has been constructed to
investigate the wettability of various
powdered materials by the fluorides,
and tests are presently being con-
ducted.

Experience to date with high-temper-
ature packing materials indicates that
in almost every instance stuffing
boxes have required retightening
after reaching operating temperature.
For example, with powdered-graphite
packing a tightening motion of 0.030
in. per inch of packing length is
required to re-establish the original
degree of compression after the packing
temperature has been elevated to
1100°F. A packing-expansion testing

&

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

rig has been constructed and the
expansion rates of various packing
materials will be investigated in the
search for a powdered material that
will show minimum dimensional change
upon being heated.

Tricresyl phosphate has proved
valuable as an antigalling lubricant.
The application of this fluid te
threads during assembly has permitted
greater ease of disassembly after
valves have operated for many hours

at 1500°F.

Sejf-%Welding of Seat Materials
(D. R. Ward, ANP Division; R. N.
Mason, Engineering and Maintenance
Division). Preliminary tests were
conducted to determine whether self-
welding is encountered in the presence
of high-temperature fluorides with
the following combinations of materials:
type 315 vs. type 316 stainless steel,
type 316 stainless steel vs. Inconel,
and Inconel vs. Inconel. Test specimens
were clamped tightly together and
submerged in fluorides for 187 hr at
1300°F. Although visual examination
showed no evidence of self-welding in
any of the specimens, metallographic
examination showed some evidence of
interdif fusion of the specimens of
similar materials. Investigation of
self-welding is being continued.

Canned-Rotor~Drivea Valve (W. B.
McDonald, A. LL. Southern, ANP Division).
Preliminary tests of the driving
elements of the canned-rotor-driven
valve(?) indicate that an operating
be built that will
operate such a valve satisfactorily.
A design of a canned-rotor-driven
valve has been completed, but the
priority given to the bellows valve
has delayed construction. The favorable
performance of the three-ply Inconel
bellows indicates that a canned-rotor
type of drive may not be required.

HEAT EXCHANGERS

Test of Core Element of Sodium-to-
Air Radiator (G. D., Whitman, A. P.
Fraas, M. E. LaVerne, ANP Division).
The second performance and endurance
test of the core element of the
sodium-to-alr radiator was initiated
on June 6, 1952, and 200 hr of operation
was logged before failure. The average
sodium inlet temperature during the
test was 1200°F, and a maximum temper-
ature of 1600°F was held for 74 hr
before failure.

As in the first radiator core
test, failure occurred in a tube
between the top fin and header on the
sodium inlet side of the radiator.
Metallographic examination of both
core elements indicated failure at a
brazed tube-to-header joint because
of local porosity in the joint, In
both cases the failure was accelerated
by the attack of the sodium on the
outer surface of the tube.

When the second test had been in
progress 72 hr a building power-supply
failure occurred and the sodium froze
in the radiator before 1t could be
drained. To resume the test, sufficient
preheat was obtained through normal
methods to restart sodium flow without
difficulty. Electric strip heaters
were used on the outside of the air
duct.

The second radiator core element
contained Nicrobrazed joints and was
identical in construction to the first
except that the fin spacing was
altered to give 15 fins per inch
instead of 10.5 fins per inch as on
the first core element.

Some fabrication difficulties have
been encountered in producing these
radiators. Since the furnace at Y-12
is too small to accommodate brazing
of air radiators for the turbojet
project, an attempt was made to
FOR PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 16, 1952

establish the technique in a new and
larger furnace located iu the rolling
mill at X-10. The
excellent example of successful
brazingof an intricate design; however,
to complete the radiator as planned,
the header caps had to be heliarc
welded in place. From the results of
several nnsuccessful attempts to do
this it may be concluded that the
heliarc method does not produce a

second core 1s an

sound welded joint in the presence
of Nicrobraz metal.

and second cores (10.5 and 15 fins per

on a temperature basis with a large
spread between the data taken with
sodium temperatures af about 500°F and
those taken with sodium temperatures

recommends basing physical properties
of the air on the boundary layer
rather than on the mean free-stream
temperature, the data were replotted.
{The mean sodium temperature in the
radiator was taken as being equivalent
to the alr temperature in the boundary
layer.) As shown im Fig. 5, this
gave excellent correlation of the
data, It should be noted that in
calculating these data full allowances
were made for variations in fin
efficiency resulting from variations
in both heat transfer coefficient and
thermal conductivity of the fins.

Since

this gave good

A third radiator with interrupted
fins has been assembled and brazed

and 1s now being tested. The fins
have been cut through and slightly
offset every 2 in. (about 50 hydraulic
radii) in the direction of the air
flow. Preliminary data show that
interruption of the fins yields an
increase in heat transfer coefficient
of approximately 30% depending on the
Beynolds number. The concomitant
increase lu pressure drop is only 10%.
Not only do the interrupted fins give
an increased heat transfer coefficient,
but it appears that they make the
heat transfer coefficient almost
independent of fin temperature at a
given air-weight flow rate instead of
falling off rapidly with an increase
in fin temperature, as was found to
be the case for the plain fins.

The use of pure uwickel in place of
stainless a fin material
should produce a substantial improvement
in fin efficiency because 1ts thermal
conductivity is nearly three times as
high. A ceramic coating is desirable,
however, to protect the nickel from
oxidation if it 1s used at temperatures
about 1200°F. The ceramics
group have developed a suitable coating

changer described in the previous
quarterly reports(*? has been completed.
Two tube failures were discovered in
the Nicrobrazed tube-to-header joint
that were not detectable from sepa-
ration. It was concluded that these
failures were caused by the vibration
in the system and the etching effect
the circulating NaK had on the tubes
in the hot zones. These failures were
encouraged by the embrittlement of
the areas near the joint by the brazing
alloy and the large grain size of the

RBotameter Type of Flowmeter (P. G.
Smith, A. L. Southern, ANP Division).
A rotameter type of flow-measuring
device has been designed for measuring
the flow of a fluoride stream at
1200 to 1500°F. This instrument
consists of a conventional rotamster
float operating in a tapered barrel.
The float position is indicated by a
tapered iron core, chrome plated to
resist corrosion, which operates in a
cylinder of static fluorides extending
downward from the flowmeter (Fig. 7).

cylinder in the vicinity of the tapered

core, and as the core moves 1n the
field of the inductance coil, the
movement 1s sensed by suitable 1in-

strumentation., The core movement may
be calibrated to very accurately
indicate the flow rate of the fluid
through the rotameter barrel. The
initial test of this instrument in a
high-temperature dynamic fluid system
was somewhat disappointing. Thermal
distortion of the cylinder in which
the tapered core 1s located resulted
in binding of the moving parts and
preventing further operation of the
instrument. A new design, which
should eliminate this difficulty, has
been completed that allows greater
clearance between the tapered core

and the containing cylinder and
requires stress relieving of the
parts before assembly. The new

instrument 1s being constructed and
will soon be incorporated in a test
loop.

This instrument consists of a
permanent magnet rotated in the fluid
stream by a small turbine. A pick-up
coil is placed outside the flowmeter
in close proximity to the rotating
magnet. This co1l, when connected to
a Hewlett-Packardelectrical tachometer

60 db of amplification, will very
accurately sense the rate of rotation
of the permanent magnet. At room
temperature this arrangement was
calibrated in terms of accurate flow
measurement with a pick-up coil located
as much as 3 in. from the magnet.
It is expected that this instrument
can be operated at high temperatures
with the pick-up coil located as close
as 1/2 in. to the magnet. The limi-
tation of this flowmeter is expected
to be the curie point of the permanent
magnet, although some operational

The deflection will be calibrated in
terms of the applied pressure. This

from an outside vendor, incorporates
the trapped-gas~space principle;
however, test results indicate that
the high-temperature fluid may be in
contact with the diaphragm without
resulting instrument failure. The
instrument is rated at 0 to 60 psi at
a maximum diaphragm deflection of
0.010 inch. The operating temperature
is limited to 1000°F at the diaphragm
to minimize the creep rate of the
Inconel; however, by using a riser
leg to the pot and diaphragm and by
cooling either the trapped gas or the

ment should accurately measure the

A level indicator has been designed
that incorporates a conventional

high-temperature packed seal. For
the first test the probe level 1s

lead screw mechanism. If the packed
seal proves to be an effective gas

Null-Balamce Level Control (P. Ww.
Taylor, A. L. Southern, ANP Division).
Fluid flow in high-temperature systems
is presently measured by means of a
venturi with trapped-gas pressure pots
to sense the pressures of the venturi
entrance and throat. Unequal levels
in the pressure pots result in con-
siderable flow measurement error,
particularly with fluids of high
density. A null-balance level con-
troller (Fig. 9) has been developed
that equalizes the level in the two
pressure pots and greatly increases
the accuracy of flow measurement.
This level controller consists of a
tapered core operating in the field
of an induction coil. The core is
attached to a float that rides on the
of the fluid in the
pressure pots. This instrument will
maintain the levels in the pots within
0.1 in. of each other.

In operation, when flow 1s started
in the system, fluid rises in the
venturi entrance and throat pressure

pots, with the fluid rising te a
higher level in the high pressure
pot. The level device causes the

greater than that of circuit No. 2.

partially across variable resistor
(A) and is fed to a Brown controller.
The signal in the controller operates
a limit switch to open a solenoid
valve, which bleeds gas into the high
pressure pot and forces the level
down. When the levels equalize, the
voltages in the two circuits buck each
other and the signal from the con-
troller drops to zero. The solenoid
valve then closes and shuts off the
gas supply. This sequence 1s repeated
at any time the levels in the two
pots become unequal.

Strain-Gage Level Indicator (A. L.
Southern, ANP Division). A level
indicator is being designed that
incorporates a three-ply Inconel
bellows to transmit pressures exerted
by rising levels to a high-temperature
This device will be
limited to use in systems pressurized
within the limits of the bellows. A
questionable feature, which must be
tested, is the long-time reliability
of high-temperature strain gages,

strain gage.

The advantage of such an instrument
is that the bellows sensing element is
completely submerged in the high-
temperature fluid and 1s not subject
to failure or loss of calibration as
a result of solid deposits sublimed
from the free surface of fuels having
a high vapor pressure, such as the
fuels containing zirconium fluoride.

characteristics, ease of filling, and
ease of emptying. The tubes were
assembled from 1-in. glass tubing and
bends with flanged joints, and the

headers were constructed of copper

sheet and tubing. A centrifugal
pump, a rotameter, a vacuum pump, and
a 50-gal reservoir were the major

pieces of auxiliary equipment. Both
water and a zinc chloride solution
were circulated in this mockup. The
zinc chloride was used to simulate
the fluorides because of 1ts density
(1.7 g/cc) and viscosity (10 cp) at
the operating temperature (90°F) of
the mockup. The operating charac-
teristics of the mockup on both water
and zinc chloride are given in Table 1.

out and the core filled completely
with liquid. In all tests with zinc
chloride solution, many small bubbles
remained in suspension in the liquid
throughout all test runs, with some
runs being as long as 20 min; however,
this equipment did not utilize a surge
and degassing tank as incorporated in

the ARE design.

All attempts to completely empty
the core by blowing out the fluid with
air failed. When 20-psig air was
applied to the top header an estimated
15% of the liquid remained in the
tubes, unevenly divided between
circuits, The largest remaining

water and zinc chloride solution,
were made by suddenly adding ink to
the fluid reservoir and observing the
relative flow rate through each of

will be combined with the core mockup

systems.

Possible Fuel-Header Manifold
for the Reactor Core (W. C. Tunnell,
ANP Division). A possible reactor
core for ANP use would comprise upper
and lower fuel headers joined by fuel
tubes in parallel. Such an arrangement
has the advantage of complete drain-
ability and allows some increased
flexibility in the external fuel
circuit.

The major problem of design is
reducing the header volume to avoid
large, relatively stagnant volumes of
fuel in regions adjacent to the high-
neutron flux of the core or in regions
subjected to delayed-neutron effects,
and at the same time providing for
optimum flow conditions in all the
parallel fuel tubes. Cptimum flow in
a right-cylinder reactor core will
provide uniform flow in all tubes if
the reactor flux is uniform throughout
the core volume or the flow conditions
vary inversely with the flux.

For purposes of investigation, a
half-scale plastic model of the bottom
half of the ARE core was built in
which all of the tubes were headered.
This was tested with water at flow
rates up to 125 gpm.

The header design started as two
plates. One of the plates served as
the tube header sheet and had grooves
milled in 1t to provide communication
to all tubes, and the other plate
provided the tube sheet closure and
had a circular milled groove in open
communication with the network of
grooves in the tube sheet. No location

1952

of inlet with respect to the tube-
sheet closure passage was found that
resulted in optimum flow.

After a series of tests it was
found that the insertion between the
original tube and closure sheets of a
third plate with appropriately po-
sitioned small holes, like a salt
shaker, and a thin annular plenum
chamber in the closure sheet over all
the holes in the middle added plate
resulted in optimum flow conditions.
It is also apparent from the tests
that variations in the flow pattern
can be obtained by variations in the
arrangement of holes in the middle
plate.

As a point of interest, the volume
of fuel i1n an ARE-size header and
supply pipes would be approximately
1942 in.%, as compared to 2780 in.®
of fuel within the tubes.

TECHNOLOGY OF FLUORIDE HANDLING

Fluoride Production (G. Nessle,
Materials Chemistry Division). The
design of equipment capable of producing
3 kg of treated fuel was completed
July 1.

Briefly, the treatment consists of
bubbling hydrogen through molten fuel
for 1 hr followed by hydrogen fluoride
for 2 hr at 1550°F. The initial
heating and melting of the fuel mix
is done under a hydrogen fluoride
atmosphere. The equipment has operated
with only one failure, which was due
to faulty welding, since being placed
in operation on July 14.

Following the success of the 3-kg-
batch equipment, the design was scaled
up for construction of equipment to
produce 25 to 30 kg per batch (50 to
75 1b). Unlike the smaller apparatus,
the 25-kg equipment requiresa receiver

29
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORY

furnace that can be lowered away {rom
the receiver to facilitate removal of
the filled receiver without disturbing
the remainder of the apparatus. Since
some zirconium tetrafluoride (around
50 g in 5 hr) is evolved during the
treatment of the fluorides at 1500°F,
a trap containing copper servo has
been introduced to prevent clogging of
the hydrogen fluoride and helium purge
lines and damage to the valves in
those lines. The trap signal, which
is sized according to the size of the
production equipment,has been quite
satisfactory and requires only minor
attention.

Calrod heaters were used to heat
the 3/8-in.-0D nickel tubing transfer
line. The treated fuel is transferred
from the treatment reactor to the
receiver by inert gas pressure.
Construction of this apparatus began
July 16 and the first rum was suc-
cessfully made on July 25.

At the end of August the total
production was 128.3 kg of treated
fuel. Table 3 gives a break-down of
the production in the two units.
Although the equipment, which is
capable of producing 60 kg per week
1f needed, 1s not operating at maximum
capacity, production 1s well ahead of
the demand.

Equipment 1s now being designed to
produce the mixture NaF-ZrfF,-UF,
(46-50-4 mole %) in the quantities
required to meet ARE fuel requirements.
The production of fluoride fuel is
dependent upon the production of
sublimed ZrF,. Arrangements have been
made to obtain sufficient hafnium-
bearing ZrF, to permit
production of fluoride fuel for
experimental needs. It 1s now possible
to produce 300 lb of sublimed ZrF,
per week startimg from the base
material ZrCl,.

Every batch of ZrF, fluoride
produced is now being crushed and
sampled prior to use in the fuel
mixture. The ZrF, thus far obtained
has been of very good quality, but
it is grayish in color because of
entrained carbon. After September,
hafnium-free ZrF, will be available
for the production of ARE fuel.

Removal of ¥luorides from Con-~
taminated Systems (LL. A. Mann, ANP
Division). High-pressure (140-psig)
steam jets are used successfully for
removing fluorides from contaminated
systems. Heavy fluoride deposits are
removed completely without damage to
the equipment. It has been found
desirable to select a steam-jet size
compatible with the size of the
equipment to be cleaned so that high-
velocity steam will always impinge
directly on the deposits to be
moved, and there will be sufficient
clearance for the spent steam to
escape from the container. In several
instances this method has reduced time
of cleaning from 48 to 4 or 5 hours.
In other cases parts have been cleaned

re=-
FOR PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10,

by this method that could not be
"economically cleaned by methods used
previously. When systems or components
are contaminated with a thin fluoride
coating, steam jets furnish no par-
ticnlar advantage over washing with
water and scrubbing with a wire brush.

Purity of Pipe Line Helium (L. A.
Mann, ANP Division). Installation of
the helium line direct to the tank car
located cutside the ‘building is
complete. After the lines were purged
the oxygen content of the helium was
reduced to ‘a level not detectable by
analyzing equipment sensitive to
1 ppm. Helium of this high purity is
now distributed to all wajor points
of usage in the experimental engineering
areas of Building 9201-3, and the
requirements for bottled helium and
argon have been greatly reduced.

Fluoride Plug-Bemoval Test from
Simulated ARE Core (L. A. Mann, ANP
Division). Some operational experience
indicated that 1t would be very
difficult to remelt a plug of frozen
fluoride in a pipe line without
rupturing the pipe. Since the ARE
core as presently designed cannot be
completely drained, tests have been
conducted to determine whether the
residual fluorides can be remelted
without damaging the core structure.
A type 316 stainless steel tube bent
to simulate an ARE core U-tube was
filled with NaF-ZrF,-UF, fuel, which
was then permitted to freeze. The
assembly was placed in a high-tempera-
ture pot furnace and cycled three
times at a heating rate of 18°F/hr
between 850 and 950°F. No failure
occurred. More fuel was then added
to the tube and insulation was placed
around the upper legs of the tube to
simulate the beryllium oxide in the
ABE core. The assembly was again
taken through eight temperature
cycles, and again no failure resulted.

1952

Additional cycles over the same temper-
ature range were then made at in-
creased heating rates, with the final
cycle being made at ful] furnace
power. Again no failure resulted.
Final examination of the tube showed
that it had expanded 0.030 in. at one
point and 0.050 in. at another point.
These tests did not entirely duplicate
ARE conditions but were probably
Just as severe.

Injection of NaK into a Flowing
Fluoride Stream (IL. A. Mann, ANP
Division; F. F., Blankenship, Materials
Chemistry Division; T. N. McVay,
Consultant, Metallurgy Division).
NaK is one of the coolants being
considered for the ARE reflector
and moderator. Since the fuel tubes
will be immersed in the coolant, it is
necessary to determine the extent of
the NaK-{fluoride reaction that would
result from a fuel-tube rupture. A
test apparatus to determine the extent
of this effect consisted of a small,
forced~circulation locp with an
Eastern centrifugal pump to circulate
fluoride fuel, NabkF-ZrF, -UF, (46-50-4
mele %), at 1500°F and a flow rate of
approximately 3 ft/sec. The effect
of both slow and rapid injection of
NaK into the fluid stream will be
measured. A NaK injection unit was
attached to this loop and when the
temperature of both the fluorides and
the NaK reached 1500°F, a quantity of
NaK (approximately 3% of the volume
of the fuel in the system) was injected
into the stream. After the injection
the pump was permitted to operate for
approximately 6 min, at which time all
heat was turned off, the pump was
stopped, and the entire assembly was
rotated through 90 deg to a horizontal
position and permitted bo freeze.

According to the exothermal re-

actions Na + UF, ——— NaF + UF, and
Na + ZrF,—— NaZrF,, heat evolution

31
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

was expected and did occur. This
was indicated by an immediate tempera-
ture rise of 200°F that was measured
by a thermocouple immediately above
the NaK injection point.

Examination of the system showed
incomplete mixing of the NaK and the
fuel and indicated that the system was
almost completely plugged by the
reaction products. Possibly flow had
stopped completely. This test in-

dicates that 1f such a failure (a

large fissure type of break) occurred
in an ABE core fuel tube during actual
operation and permitted a similar NaK
injection, the flow in the tube would
be completely stopped or considerably
slowed down. The fuel residence time
in the tube would thus be increased to
the point where very high temperatures
would result and perhaps bring about
complete rupture of the tube. The
possibility that the plug would heal
the leak and prevent the flow of fuel
into the interstices of the moderator
is still a matter of speculation.

The loop was sectioned into seven
large pieces and most of the pieces
were subsequently subdivided as in-
dicated in Fig. 10. Also, the general
appearance and the complexity of the
products observed are suggested in
Fig. 10.

The extent and distribution of the
altered fuel suggests that complete
or nearly complete plugging of the
loop occurred very soon after the NaK
was injected. Material in the surge
tank had been attacked only slightly
and even less reaction had occurred
on the side of the loop opposite the
injection point. The plugging and
consequent lack of circulation were,
of course, responsible for the system
being very far from chemical equilibrium
and for the large differences observed
between this experiment and the static
systems described in the section on

32

“Chemistry of High-Temperature Liquids”
(sec. 9).

Samples of material from each
section of this loop have been examined
by x-ray diffraction, chemical analysis,
and the petrographic microscope.
Since the material found varies con-
siderably from the center to the edge
of each section, as well as along the
axis of the pipe, complete characteri-
zation of all the material has proved
virtually impossible.

Such phases as the crystal solution
of NaUF, in NaZrF,, Na,ZrF,, UF,, and
numerous complex compounds of KF
occur in abundance. In addition,
metallic zirconium occurs in sections
3B and 4 just above the NaK injection
point. At least two additional phases,
which are unknown, are recognized in
considerable quantity in this loop.
One is the dark-brown phase that is
pleochroic and has an average index of
refraction at about 1.556. The other
is an orange-red phase generally
associated with, and perhaps formed
from, the brown phase. This mineral
has an average index of refraction of

about 1.588, with low birefringence,
and is probably monclinic. Tt 1s
probably a compound of UF,, since

some crystals are available that seem
to indicate transitions from this red
phase to pure UF,.

A second test will be conducted
during which NaK will be injected
into the fuel stream at a much slower
rate to determine the effects of a
very slow leak. It is thought that
fuel circulating at high velocity will
perhaps sweep the reaction products
from a very slow leak out of the
reactor core.

Cooled-Baffle Vapor Trap for
Zirconiom-Bearing Fluoride Fuel (W. B.
McDonald, J. M. Trummel, ANP Division;
F. A. Anderson, Research Participant).
A cooled-baffle vapor trap was de-
veloped to condense and collect the
Zr¥, vapor that evolves from the
NafF-ZrF,-UF, fuel. The vapor trap
consisted of a 3-in.-diameter pipe
24 in, long containing 28 baffles
spaced at 3/4~in. intervals, with
the openings in the baffles alternated
from one side of the pipe to the
other. A cooling coil through which
water was circulated was placed around
the complete length of the baffled
pipe. High-purity helium wes passed
across the free surface of the 1500°F
fuel and exhausted through the baffled
pipe. Filter paper was placed at the
exhaust port to collect any solid
particles not trapped by the baffles.
The flow rate of the helium across
the free surface was

15 cfh.

approximately

After slightly more than 50 hr of
operation the baffled pipe was so
completely plugged by the material
sublimed from the fuel that greatly
increased pressure was required to
maintain the specified gas flow rate.
This pressure increase resulted in the
bulging of the top and bottom of the
flat fuel container to such an extent
that the test was terminated. Ex-
amination showed that the baffle pipe
was completely plugged by a hard
crystalline deposit at the point of
entry into the fuel container. The
remainder of the pipe contained heavy

deposits of fine, powdery material.

34

This test indicates that a baffled
vapor trap 1s entirely unsatisfactory
for the preventionof gas~line plugging.
Other types of liquid vapor traps are
presently being tested. One of these
tests consists of passing the gas from
the free surface of zirconium-bearing
fuel through a bath of NaF-KF-LiF
(11.5-42.0-46.5 mole %) at 1500°F,
and there 1s a similar test in which
the vapors from zirconium-bearing fuel
are passed through a bath of NaK at
1500°F. These tests still in
operation and the results have not

Descaling and Pickling Tests (D., C.
Vreeland, E. E. Hoffman, R. B. Day,
L.. D. Dyer, Metallurgy Division).
In connection with the problem of
removing welding scale from ARE
components some tests have been run
to check different methods af de~
scaling and pickling oxidized Inconel.
Sodium and NaK were mentioned as being
two of the most promising descalers
(from a handling viewpoint) to be
tested. Oxidized Inconel specimens
were treated, 1n statlc corrosion
test tubing, for various times and
temperatures with sodium and with Nak,
The results of these tests are best
summarized by reference to Fig. 11.
It is quite apparent that in these
tests neither sodium nor Nak
efficient as an oxide scale remover
until the test temperature was raised
to approximately 800°C. Ia order to
determine whether a dynamic NaK system
would be any more efficient as a scale
remover, an oxidized Inconel specimen
fastened into the bottom of an
Inconel tube by crimping. The tube
was then half filled with NaK, sealed,
and run in the rocker furnace for 4 hr
at approximately 700°C. The oxide
scale was not removedby this treatment
and so, apparently, the temperature
of test 1s the deciding factor in
scale removal.

the following power and temperature
maximums would be rather moderate.

The general properties of the
reflector-moderated circulating-fuel
reactor were discussed in the last
report. {?) A number of multigroup IPM
calculations has since been performed.
However, this is the first time that
the method has been applied to reactors
with very different properties in core
and reflector and with absorptions that
are fairly large and also vary within
a lethargy interval. Hence, con-
firmation of the results by critical
experiment 1s necessary.

A calculation was performed regard-
ing the critical mass, power distri-
bution, and neutron spectrum of a
mockup of the ABE for use in critical
experiments. So far only the critical
mass has been determined experimentally,
The agreement with the calculation was
very good (cf., sec. 4, “Critical
Experiments’’).

A previously known method of com-
puting the effects of gaps on reactivity
was refined and has yielded satis-
factory agreement with experiment.
In addition, several slowing-down
kernels have been expressed in terms
of known functions.

to the results quoted in the last
report, (*) it was found that rather
satisfactory limits can be set on the
second power and temperature maximum
following a disturbance of the reactor.

A large disturbance, such as intro-
duction of excess reactivity, will be

ture maximums. However, these maximums
are of short duration and can, within
limits, be tolerated, 1f it can be
ascertained that they will not be

temperature maximums, The third and
following maximums are smaller than
the second because of the damping of
the reactor oscillations.

No general relationship has been
set up between the upper limit for the
second maximums and the other parameters
of the reactor. However, two specific
examples have been investigated by
numerical integration. Both inte-
grations refer to a reactor with the
following parameters, which fall in
the general range of contemplated ANP

removal of all material from the test
cell is also shown on the graph. It
1s noted that with the hydrogenous
component 3 in. or more thick, the
presence of the boron does not greatly
reduce the reflector savings. Com-
parison of these data with earlier
results show, however, that the boron
reduces the reactivity up to 30% for
plastic thicknesses approaching zero.

extending beyond the beryllium oxide,
is about 6.5 kg of U23%,

Before the critical experiment was
performed, a calculation of the
critical mass, power distribution, and
neutron spectrum had been carried
out.{3%) According to this calcu-
lation, the assembly should have gone
critical with about 58 tubes. However,
the following three effects, which had
not been included in the computation,
each add about one tube to the com-
puted critical mass so that there is
almost perfect agreement between ex-
periment and theoretical prediction.

1. A chemical analysis of the
Inconel actually used was received
after the computation was finished.
The analysis showed the Inconel to
be more of a poison than anticipated.

2. The computationdid not consider
the loss of reactivity caused by voids
into which additional fuel tubes would
have been inserted if necessary.

3. Over and above the poison con-
sidered in the computation, some poison
was introduced by a stainless steel
piece in the control assembly.

No experimental data are available,
as yet, regarding power distribution
or neutron spectrum.

Physics

The 11d tank facility was used
primarily for tests of the reactor
shield for the G-E direct-cycle design
(sec. 5). Extensive surveys have been
made on the flux patterns in and around
large annular air ducts. In addition,
a study has been carried out on the
production of secondary gamma rays in
a metal layer near the reactor. The
correlation between the
data from the lid tank
and the bulk shielding facilities
indicated that the data from the lid
tank facility give an attenuation that
1s low by a factor of about 2, Thais
is of particular importance because of
the number of shield designs based on
lid tank data,

The gamma-ray spectral measurements
on the divided shield mockup have been
completed in the bulk shielding facility
{sec. 6). The last measurements made
gave the energy and angular distri-
bution of the gamma rays streaming
around the edge of the lead shadow

out to determine the amount of energy
released per fission, and a special
fuel element has been constructed for
this purpose. Irradiation of mice,
rats, and rabbits by neutrons from the
Cockeroft-Walton accelerator was cone
tinued, and plans are being made to
expose monkeys to the radiation from
the bulk shielding reactor. A graphite
thermal column has been installed and
will be used with the gamma-ray spec~
trometer for measuring capture gamma
rays.

Construction of the tower shielding
facility has recently been approved,
and the design criteria have been
completed (sec. 7). Preliminary
design work onmechanical and electronic
components is under way, and orders
have been placed for some of the
commercially available components.

Fission cross sections of U??* und

Experimental efforts inthe lid tank
facility have centered around the de-
sign of the shield for the G-E direct-
cycle reactor, Studies made on a
mockup of the outlet air ducts in the
GE-ANP initial engine have provided
estimates of the radiation that will
penetrate the G-E aircraft-reactor
shield, These estimates agree with
the approximate values obtained
theoretically by using assumptions of
isotropic scattering at the bends and
geometrical attenuation down the ducts.

The gamma shield for the side of the
G-E reactor was also mocked up in an
attempt to optimize the arrangement of
the components, In addition, the
contribution of a metal layer near the
reactor is being evaluated both in
terms of the increase in shield weight
and the reduction in radiation level.

Calculations have been made in an
attempt to correlate the neutron
attenuation data obtained in the lid
tank facility with those obtained in
the bulk shielding reactor. The lid
tank measurements seem to be lower by
a factor of about 2, depending on the
distance from the source. Since many
shield designs are based on lid tank
data, an attempt
improve this situation by altering the
lid tank geometry source,

(Fig. 19), has been examined in the
lid tank facility. Measurements were
made of the thermal-neutron intensity,
the fast-neutron dose, and the gamma
dose, Figures 20 and 21 give the
results plotted as iscdose curves, and
Figs. 22 and 23 give fast-neutron
traverses as taken,

These measurements are primarily of
interest in estimating the radiation
that will penetrate the shield of the
G-E aircraft reactor, The geometry is
so complex that calculations of the
effect of the duct are difficult and
(with the present knowledge) not very
reliable. To a very rough first
approximation, however, the measured
transmission of neutrons agrees with
calculations based on the assumptions
of isotropic scattering at the bends
and geometrical attenuation down the
duct, (1)

At the sides of the tank, where the
neutron flux varied laterally across
the counters, discrepancies appeared
as a result of different counter
diameters, This 1s attributed to the
fact that the effective center of
counting is not the geometric center
of the counters. Careful corrections
for this effect were not made, and as
a consequence the dosages given may be
in error by an amount corresponding to
a 1- or 2-cm displacement in the water.
The relative spacing of the isodoses,
however, is considerably more accurate,

ethylene-lined dosimeter, (2) The
thermal-neutron fluxes can thus be
normalized to fast-neutron dose, to
which they should be directly prox
portional, provided there are no major
perturbations in the neutron spectra,

The gamma background dose with the
shutter closed was of the order of 50%
of that with the shutter open and
therefore not negligible. Since,
furthermore, this ratio varies with
position, the difference was perforce
measured for all points to obtain the
attributable to the fission
source,

dose

The distribution of neutron and
gamma dose around this duct was also
measured for various lengths of tran-
sition section. The gamma-dose distri-
butions for transition section lengths
of 0, 6, 12, and 18 in, have been
completed. For each geometry a center-
line traverse was made (Fig. 24) and
an isodose curve plotted (Figs. 25 and
26). Figure 27 shows several isodose

curves made with only water in the

tank.

The center-line measurement given
in Fig. 23 shows the difference be-
tween the readings with the shutter
open and closed, The 1sodose plots
have not been subtracted, since 1t is
apparent that the transition section
has no marked effect upon the dose.

The gamma isodoses are all auto-
matically normalized to a local reactor
power monitor. Since this monitor
reads less by a factor of 0.777 when
the shutter is closed, the corres-
ponding isodoses represent a dose
higher by 1/0.777 than the shutter-
open isodoses, as is noted on the
figures. In the case of the pure-
water isodoses, the reswvlting curves
very nearly coincide, whereas with the
duct mockup in place there is a sepa-
ration of about 10 cm. This can be
attributed to the presence of gammas
from thermal~-neutron capture in the
iron of the duct. The thermal-neutron
flux, of course, is considerably
affected by the shutter.

R-1 REACTOR(®) GAMMA SHIELDING

The gamma shielding on the side of
the G-E aircraft reactor was mocked up
in the lid tank facility, and measures
were taken to determine its optimum
position in relation to the pressure
shell. The shield design under con-
sideration consisted of 4 in. of pure-
water reflector next to the reactor,
a l-in., steel pressure shell, and
additional iron and lead in borated
water. The question under consideration
here was whether the additional iron
and lead could be placed next to the
pressure shell or whether it was

(farthest from the source) and the

2.2-cm iron slab for the pressure
shell was removed. These data are
shown graphically in Figs. 29, 30,

in gamma dose at 70 cm from the source
as a function of gamma shield position.

Moving the gamma shield back 28 cm
from the pressure shell reduced the
gamma intensity by only 20% although
the weight of this component was in-
creased by 5000 pounds. This intensity
reduction can be achieved, on the
other hand, by adding only 1 cm of
iron 28 cm back from the main gamma
shield with a corresponding weight
increase of only 2000 pounds. The
iron slab 10.16 cm from the source
reduced the radiation by about 20%,

OTHER LID TANK EXPERIMENTS

Other work that has just been com-
pleted in the lid tank facility and
has not been published consists of
measurements on a mockup of the inlet
air duct¢*) of the G-E aircraft reactor
and a mockup of an array of round,
wavy ducts (Fig, 33), which are still
considered to be a possible means of
carrying the cooling air to and from
the reactor, Work 1s now under way to
determine the effect on thermal-neutron
dosage of borating the water around
the exit air duct.

CORRELATION OF NEUTRON ATTENUATION DATA

E. P. Blizard
Physics Division

By the use of somewhat elaborate
transformations, the water-neutron
attenuation data from the lid tank
facility and the bulk shielding reactor
have been compared, ¢%) The lid tank
data seem to be lower by a factor of
somewhat less than 2 at large distances
but more than 2 close to the sources.
The reason for this discrepancy 1s

ing of Mobile Reactors - II., ORNL-1133 (to be
published in Reactor Science and Technology).

not understood, but several possible
explanations have been suggested.
Primary among these is the possibility
that the lid tank source plate 1s
actually operating at a somewhat lower
power than was indicated by early
measurements. The calculation of lid
tank source-plate leakage is compli-
cated by the rather difficult geometry
of the cylindrical, natural-uranium
slugs of which the source is made.
Installation of new, thin-plate U3238%
is being studied to determine how much
this might be expected to improve the
situation. Indications are that it
would be very desirable since so many
shield designs are based on lid tank
data,

The first series of studies of
gamma-ray spectra and angular distri-
butions with the divided shield mockups
have been completed. The final
measurements incorporated a lead
shadow shield and data obtained with
this arrangement will be used to
calculate the gamma-ray dose at the
crew compartment.

Plans are being made for using the
recoil-proton spectrometer to measure
spectra and angular distributions of
fast neutrons leaving the reactor part
of the divided shield mockup.

In order to resolve the uncertainty
of the power of the bulk shielding
reactor, an attempt is being made to
obtain a more accurate value of the

energy released per fission. A special
fuel element equipped with thermocouples
and water-flow tubes has been con-
structed so that the energy per fission
can be determined as a measure of
temperature rise and water flow.

Preparations are under way to
expose monkeys to radiation from
the bulk shielding reactor, and a
tentative program has been arranged.
Animals previously irradiated by the
Cockcroft-Walton accelerator are now
under observation.

A graphite thermal column has been
installed in the bulk shielding
facility to provide an intense source
of thermal neutrons. With this source,
the gamma rays produced by neutron
capture can be studied.

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

MOCKUP OF THE DIVIDED SHIELD

Gamma-ray spectral measurements
during the past quarter were made with
a lead shadow shield added to the
mockup of the aircraft divided shield.(?)
These measurements complete the first
series of studies of gamma-ray spectra
and angular distributions with the
divided shield mockup. The data
obtained will be used for a preliminary
calculation of the gamma-ray dose
received at the crew-compartment
location, which will then be compared
with the estimates of the Shielding
Board. (2)

The results obtained with the lead
shields are shown in a series of five
figures. Figure 34 shows a gamma-ray
1sodose curve obtained by using an ion
chamber without the lead disks. This
curve 1s very nearly a segment of a
circle with a radius of 168.2 cm and
a center near the reactor center. The
other curve in Fig. 34 shows the dose
along this same circle after addition
of the leak disks.

From these data it was decided to
examine the energy and angular distri-
butions at the angles ¥ = 0 deg and
Y = 50 deg, where Y is the angle
between the aircraft axis and a line
connecting the pseudo reactor center
and the nose of the spectrometer
collimator. The energy spectra ob-
tained for various values of the
angle @ are shown in Figs. 35 and 36
for y = 0 and 50, respectively, where
fis the angle between the spectrometer
collimator and the line joining the
pseudo reactor center and the nose of
the spectrometer collimator. The
corresponding angular distributions
are shown in Figs. 37 and 38.

Development of the recoil-proton
spectrometer is continuing. Plans
are being made to use the instrument
for measuring spectra and angular
distributions of fast neutrons leaving
the reactor part of a divided shield
mockup when the air-scattering ex-
periments are completed. A report on
the theory of this instrument has
recently been published. (3)

AIR-SCATTERING EXPERIMENTS

A memorandum(*) giving the details
of the air-scattering experiments
described in the previous report has
been issued. Similar experiments at
100-kw reactor power are now getting
under way.

REACTOR POWER DETERMINATION

One of the largest uncertainties
in the determination of the power of
the bulk shielding reactor rests in
the lack of an accurate value for the
energy released per fission. A special
fuel element has been constructed to
be used in measuring this quantity
(Fig. 39). The center fuel plate of
the element is removable and disks
are punched out of the plate. The
gamma activities of these uranium-
bearing disks are counted after an
exposure to determine the number of
fissions that occurred in the fuel
element and then compared with the
gamma activity in a similar disk
previously calibrated in the standard
reactor.

The special fuel element is equipped
with thermocouples and water-flow
tubes. Special precautions against

SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION

The research on high-temperature
liguids has been directed primarily
toward the production of a fuel for
the ARE. The longer range work is
principally concerned with studies of
fluoborate systems and the purification
of hydroxides (sec. 9). The ARE fuel
is in the system NaF-ZrF,-UF,, and the
most probable composition is 46 mole %
NaF, 50 mole % ZrF,, and 4 mole % UF,.
The melting point of this composition
is 510°C and its vapor pressure and
viscosity are tolerable. A satis-
factory loading technique involving
the addition of ZrF,-UF, to an NaF-ZrF,
base has been proposed, Numerous
fluoride systems, with and without UF,,
have been examined, and systems con-
taining UF, have been prepared, The
study of the reaction of fluorides
with alkali metals has indicated that
large quantities of NaK may be added
to the system NaF-ZrF,-UF, before
producing any free UF,.

Most of the corrosion research
during the past guarter has centered
around the determination of corrosion
characteristics of fluoride mixtures
containing ZrF, (sec. 10). Both static
and dynamic tests indicate that this
class of fuels and coolants is less
corrosive than the previously tested
fluoride fuel systems, an improvement
which may result from better material
production and testing techniques.
Static tests and dynamic tests have
been run with fluorides and hydroxides

to determine the effects of such
variables as time, temperature,
additives, stress, and environment.

A curious result was the apparent de-
crease of fluoride attack with in-
creasing temperature. This may have
been the result of the formation of a
protective oxide coating, Aside from
the reduced attack that may have
resulted from improved preparation
techniques, the most significant

advance during the last quarter came
from the addition of ZrH, to the
NaF-KF-LiF-UF, mixture, To supplement
corrosion tests, considerable effort
has been applied to fundamental studies
of the corrosion mechanism, including
synthesis and identification of cor-
rosion products. The hypothesis that
fluoride corrosion of Inconel depletes
the chromium from the metal lattice and
the resulting voids precipitate has
been supported by further tests and
observations,

The metallurgical methods for the
construction and assembly of the Air-
craft Reactor Experiment, including
welding and brazing, fabrication of
control rods, and ceramic coating of
radiator fins, have been developed
(sec, 11). Specifications have been
established on procedure and qualifi-
cations for inert-arc welding of
Inconel pipe and fittings for highly
corrosive applications. The B,C-Fe
and the Al1,0,-B,C inserts for the ARE
control and regulating rods have been
pressed, An apparently satisfactory
high-temperature ceramic coating has
been applied to nickel sheet for use
in a liquid metal-to-air radiator. In
addition, the creep and stress of
Inconel are being determined in air
and argon, and the mechanical and
corrosion-resistance properties of
brazed joints are being investigated.
Tensile tests have shown brazed-joint
efficiencies as high as 92%,

Heat transfer and physical proper-
ties measurements on various fluorides
have resulted in lessening the effort
on liquid metal and hydroxide measure-
ments (sec. 12), The viscosity of the
ARE fuel, NaF-ZrF,-UF, (46-50-4 mole %),
ranges from 20 to 7 centipoises be-
tween 580 and 830°C. The vapor
pressure of this fuel increases from

12 to 84 mm Hg between 807 and 940°C,

75
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

Thermal conductivity, heat capacity,
and density measurements have been
made on several high-temperature
liquids. The experimental heat
transfer data for sodium hydroxide may
be represented by an equation that can
be evaluated to within 9% of the
values normally used for ordinary
fluids. A heat-momentum-transfer
analysis of a thermal convection loop
indicates a circulation velocity of
about 0.1 ft/sec.

The radiation damage program in-
cludes irradiation of fluoride fuel
mixtures, measurements of the effect
of radiation on creep and thermal

conductivity, and operation of 1in-
reactor loops (sec. 13). Reactor
irradiations of a mixture containing
ZrF, indicate that no significant
radiation-induced corrosion will occur
at ARE intensities, An experiment to
determine the rate of diffusion of
Xe!3% from the irradiated static fuel
mixture NaF-BeF,-UF, indicated that
almost all the xenon will remain in
the fuel unless flushed out. The
1700°F annealing temperature proposed
for the ARE fuel tubes appears to be
of some consequence in minimizing creep
and thermal conductivity changes under
irradiation. No radiation-induced
corrosion was observed in the sodium
in-reactor loop,

 

9. CHEMISTRY OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE LIQUIDS

W. BR. Grimes, Materials Chemistry Division

Research in the ANP chemistry group
has been concerned almost entirely with
studies of fluoride mixtures for use
as fuels and coolants for an aircraft
reactor. Although the major effort
has necessarily been directed to
problems of immediate comcern to the
ARE, a number of longer range studies
is being carried out.

The program in research and pilot-
scale production of liquid fuels of
high purity is still actively followed,
although responsibility for production
of the large quantities of such ma-
terials needed for engineering evalu-
ation is now shared with the experi-
mental engineering group,

Efforts continue on definition of
the optimum composition of the ARE
fuel and on studies of corrosion of
metals by the various high-temperature
liquids being considered. The previous
attempts to identify chemical species
in the cooled melts before and after
corrosion testing have continued.

16

A study of the possible reactions
of the fuel mixture with alkali metals
at elevated temperature has been
initiated to ascertain in quantitative
fashion the effect of a leak between
the fuel and moderator circuits,
Detailed study of the system after
reduction of UF, and/or Zr¥, has
indicated that the mixture of products
is quite complex even if chemical
equilibrium is obtained. Some indi-
cations of equilibrium among U¥F,, UF,,
ZrF,, and lower valence fluorides of
zirconium suggest, however, that
addition of small amounts of alkali
metals may be beneficial as far as
corrosion is concerned.

Detailed explanation of the systems
obtained by addition of NaK to the
various fluoride fuels has necessitated
reactivation of the study of the
preparation and the properties of UF,,
Preparation of the pure material has
been accomplished on a moderate scale,
and studies of its chemical properties
and phase equilibriums in systems of
which it 1s a component are under way.
FOR

The preparation of a simulated fuel
for the ARE critical experiment has
been concluded, and the tubes have
heen filled with powder by the Y-12
Production Division. Satisfactory
progress is being wade on the only
remaining problem ~ filling one tube
with a solid rod of fuel.

A small program dealing with the
purification of alkali hydroxides and
the determination of the high-tempera-
ture properties of these materials has
been maintained.

FUEL MIXTURES CONTAINING UF,

Several binary systems have been
studied because of the need for this
information in comstruction on the
three-component systems containing
them. The binary and ternary mixtures
containing aluminum fluoride that have
been examined show little promise of
successful application,

The four-component system NaF-KF-
ZrF,-UF, appears to yield no melting
points below 510°C at the 4 mole %
UF, level, Since this temperature can
be achieved in the NaF-ZrF,-UF, system
at this uranium level, more attention
has been paid to the simpler three-
component system,

The mixture containing 50 mole %
Zr¥,, 46 mole % NaF, and 4 mole % UF,
appears at present to be the most
promising of the fuel mixtures. This
material, which melts at 510°C, shows
a partial pressure of ZrF, of 13 mm at
1500°F, and its viscosity seems satis-
factory for the ARE (cf., “Heat
Transfer and Physical Properties
Research,” sec. 12). Slightly lower
(8 mm) vapor pressure and lower
viscosity values are available with

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1952

the similar mixture containing 46
mole % ZrF,, 50 mole % NaF, and 4
mole % UF,. This mixture, which
appears to freeze to a single solid
solution of NaUF; in NaZrkgs melts
sharply at 520°C. The final choice
between these mixtures has not been
made. Their preparation, handling,
and corrosion problems appear very
similar,

Start-up of the reactor by filling
the machine with NaF-ZrF, (corres-
ponding to either of these fuels) and
adding the NaF-UF, eutectic (26 mole %
UF,) to bring the fuel to criticality
would not be an easy operation, since
a mixture melting as high as 700°C
could be produced by local concen-
trations and inadequate mixing.

However, on the line representing
50 mole % NaF the melting point de-
creases gradually from NaUF, (m.p.,
710°C) to NaZrFg (w.p., 510°C). All
intermediate mixtures appeaT to be
solid solutions of the twos compounds,
The mixture containing 25 mole % UF
and 75 mole % ZrF, melts at 610°C and
should contain about 105 lb of uranium
per cubic foot at 800°C, This mixture
could, presumably, be used to bring
the reactor to criticality at tempera-
tures above 625°C,

NaF-KF-ZrF,-UF,. Data presented
previously(1) showed that at the 4
mole % UF, level two compositions in
the NaF-KF-ZrF,-UF, system yielded
melting points below 500°C. Re-
examination of the system indicates
that these determinations were in
error. The lowest melting point
verified in this system is at 505°C and
corresponds to 38.4 mole % ZrF,, 18.7

mole % NaF, 38.9 mole % KF, and 4.0
mole % UF,.

Material containing 53 mole % KF,
5 mole % NaF, 40 mole % ZrF,, and 2
mole % UF, melts at 410°C, and it would
prove to be a very satisfactory fuel
for a future model with sufficient
volume to contain a critical mass of
this composition,

NaF-ZrF,-UF,. Tentative contours
for the NaF-ZrF,-UF, system are shown
in Fig. 41. Although some difficulty
was experienced in reproducing data in
this system, possibly because of the
ease of oxidation and hydrolysis of
the quadrivalent fluorides, repeated
measurements have indicated that the
contours are not in serious error,

especially in the low-melting-point
region, It should be possible to use
up to 8 mole % UF, should this be
necessary with melting points below

530°C,

NaF-ZrF, -BeF, -UF,. Systems con-
taining BeF, have previously been
shown to possess high viscosities in
the 600 to 700°C range, but a number
of such systems have usefully low
melting points, Some attempts have
been made to decrease the melting
point of the NaF-ZrF,-UF, system by
addition of BeF,. Additions of BeF,

Mixtures with 10 and 15 mole % BeF,

Addition of ZrF, to a ternary mix-
ture of NaF-BeF,-UF, (76-12-12 mole %,
respectively; m.p., 480°C) caused an
initial rise in melting point. At
10 mole % ZrF,, the mixture melted at
670°C; at 20 mole % ZrF,, the melting
point was 570°C,

If the viscosities of these mixtures
are usefully low, additional study of
the four-component system will be
attempted.

Zn¥,-UF,. Thermal data were obtained
with a number of mixtures in the ZnF,-
UF, system. The data indicate compound
formation but do not show definitely
the composition or melting point of
the compound. The lowest melting point
observed was 730 + 10°C. Since none
of the alkali fluoride~zinc fluoride
systems showed low melting points,
further work on this system is not
presently contemplated.

FUEL MIXTURES CONTAINING UF,

V. 8S. Coleman W. C. Whitley

Study of the phase relationships of
uranium trifluoride with other fluorides
is of interest for several reasons.
This compound may be a product of
radiation damage to fuels containing
uranium tetrafluoride, Tt has a lower
vapor pressure than uranium tetra-
fluoride and might produce fuels with
more suitable ligquid-temperature
ranges than uranium tetrafluoride.
Since it is a much less powerful
oxidant, uranium trifluoride may be
less corrosive to container material
than uranium tetrafluoride. Uranium
trifluoride has been observed in the
product after NaK has been added to
fuels containinguranium tetrafluoride.

1952

About 3000 g of UF, has been
prepared by the method described in a
previous report.¢?) This material,
the analysis of which is higher than
99% UF,, has been used in all the

studies reported below.

Uranium trifluoride 1s quite stable
at room temperature but oxidizes
rapidly at elevated temperatures in
the presence of traces of water vapor
or other oxidizing agents. It is
therefore necessary to protect UF,
from all oxidizing agents when it is
involved in high-temperature studies.
This is accomplished in these experi-
ments by use of the apparatus dia-
grammed in Fig. 42. This apparatus
contains a stuffing-box seal?)
packed with an oil-free graphite-
asbestos product. This seal permits
the removal of air and water vapor by
means of a vacuum pump; an inert
atmosphere is then maintained while
the sample is studied at high tempera-
ture.

NaF-KF-LiF~UF;. Some preliminary
experiments were performed with the
eutectic mixture of NaF, KF, LiF, and
varying amounts of UF, up to 10 mole %.
Jt was observed that the freezing
point of the eutectic mixture was
depressed by an amount up to 13°C.
However, the molten material diffused
through the graphite crucible and
stirrer and cemented them quite firmly
to the stainless steel container.
Examination of the product showed that
some of the UF; had been oxidized,
some had been converted into alkali
fluoride complexes, and some remained
as unreacted UF,.

is 4 matter of interest in itself,
This reaction does not occur with the
eutectic when UF, is used instead of
UF;. Three pieces of graphite exposed
to 5 mole % UF, in the NaF-LiF-KF
eutectic at temperatures up to 900°C
were found to contain 11.8 wt % uranium.
The pronounced odor of acetylene when
the mixture 1s exposed to moisture
suggests that a uranium carbide is
produced. Since the lowest recorded
temperature for the reaction of uranium
metal and carbon was 1200°C and most
workers reported 1700°C or higher, the
uranium carbide is being formed at a
much lower temperature than would be
expected. Examination of the broken
graphite with binoculars magnifying
30X shows the presence of red-orange,
green, and white crystals. Inter-
granular penetration of the carbon 1s
obvious. Since the reacted mixtures
smell strongly of acetylene when
exposed, it appears that the carbide
compound diffused throughout the melt.

KF-UF,. Attempts to study the
simpler binary system, KF-UF;, showed
that the mixture containing 5 mole %

UF; vielded breaks in the cooling
curve at 824 and at 711°C. However,
the molten material again diffused

through and reacted with the graphite
crucible to such an extent that further
work on this system could not be
attempted in graphite containers,

NaF-UF;. Studies are now being
made on the NaF-UF,; system. The
molten material in this system does
not diffuse through a graphite crucible.
Cooling curves have been taken on two
mixtures, and in each case two breaks
were observed:

UF, FIRST BREAK SECOND BREAK
(mole %) (°c) (°c)
5 as? 588
10 922 588

1952

These few studies suggest that a
eutectic exists at 588°C, but the
location is as yet indefinite. These
studies will be continued.

Preparation of Compounds of UF,.
Attempts have been made to prepare
compounds of UF; of known composition
that would aid in identification of
unknown compounds in phase equilibrium
studies. For this purpose samples
corresponding to NaF-UF;, 2NaF-UF,,
KF-UF,, and ZrF,-UF; have been mixed
and added to reaction tubes that were
then evacuated, flushed, filled with
helium, sealed, and heated to 900°C
for about 1 hour. The materials pro-
duced were examined by the techniques
of x~ray diffraction and chemical
Microscopy.

Although the products are not all
completely characterized, it appears
that NaUF, is prepared in reasonable
yield by heating the first three
mixtures. The samples corresponding
to NaF-UF, show some unreacted UF,, a
suggestion of a second compound, but
no NaF. The 2NaF-UF, samples show
material that is presumably NaUF, with
unreacted NaF, no UF,, and some poorly
de fined crystals that may be an
additional compound.

The KF-UF, sample shows a dark-red
cubic compound with a refractive index
of 1.556 and essentially complete
reaction, as revealed by failure to
detect the starting materials. Tt is
likely that the red material is KUF,.

The UF,-ZrF, sample appeared to be
mossy-green when in large crystals and
mustard~yellow when finely ground. A
new phase is evident, with 15 to 20% of
the UF; remaining and with some ZrF,
and UF,. The refractive index of the
material is in the range 1.56 to 1.58.

interest in fuel
with melting points and
viscosities lower than those under
consideration for the ARE has prompted
examination of the alkali fluoborate
systems. It is obvious that separation
of boron isotopes would be required to
make such a fuel feasible and that
appreciable pressures of BF; would
exist over such a fuel in the tempera-
ture range
reactors.

The long-range
mixtures

proposed for aircraft
Since neither of these
obstacles would appear to be insur-
mountable, the study of phase relation-
ships and decomposition pressures of
some alkali fluoborate systems was
started. To date, only the commercially
available fluoborates of sodium and
potassium have been used in this study.

Figure 43 shows a schematic diagram
of the apparatus employed for measure-
ment of decomposition pressures of
these materials. Graphite liners were
tried initially as containers for the
fluoborates, but they were discarded
in favor of stainless steel liners
because of the adsorption of gases by
the graphite. Nickel and Monel
thermocouple wells proved unsatis-
factory because of corrosion and
embrittlement
posure, Stainless steel wells are,
apparently, quite satisfactory. It
should be noted that the corrosion
described resulted from contact with
commercial NaBF, and KBF,, which are

in a few hours of ex-

82

known to contain appreciable amounts
of impurities.

The apparatus used for thermal
analysis of fluoborate systems is the
same as that used for phase studies
with UF;. The preliminary studies have
shown that the techniques and apparatus
are satisfactory. Extension of this
research with pure NaBF, and KBF, and
with mixtures of these materials with
alkali fluorides will be attempted.

Vapor Pressures of Commercial
Fluoborates. The vapor pressures of
the commercial NaBF, (*) and KBF, (>
and one mixture of these two materials
have been measured. The data may be
expressed by the equation:

log P (mm Hg) = - A B
K

Table 5 gives the values for the con-
stants A and B together with the values
reported in the literature, which were
presumably obtained with purer ma-
terials. The vapor pressures observed
with the commercial NaBF, are slightly
lower than the values calculated from
the equation in the literature. The
pressures observed with the commercial
KBF, are much higher than the literature
values. Since the NaBF,
about twice as much silicon as the
KBF,, the discrepancy must be due to
other volatile impurities in the KBF,.

The need for a more

sensitive

thermal analysis procedure, especially
FOR PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10,

for careful examination of important
samples, has been evident for some
time, Two different experimental
arrangements have recently been used
for differential thermal analysis,
with promising results. It is expected
that increasing use of equipment of
this type will be made. Equipment for
accurate control of heating and cooling
rates will be incorporated as soon as
possible; manual adjustment of these
rates, however, seems to lead to use-
ful information.

For the smaller apparatus, a nickel
block was drilled to accommodate the
l- to 2-g samples, the Al,0; reference
material, and a thermocouple. The
block, the differential thermocouple,
the temperature recording couple, and
the metal tube for introduction of
inert gas are mounted together and
inserted into a ceramic tube within a
vertical 1-in. tube furnace. The
output of the platinum-platinum=-rhodium
couples is fed to a preamplifier and
to a Brown recorder.

Tracings were obtained with two
NaF-ZrF,-UF, fuels of the compositions
50-46-4 mole % and 46~50-4 mole %.
The latter curve is shown in Fig. 44,
Neither fuel exhibited thermal effects
in these tracings above the stated
melting points of the fuels. However,
both materials showed thermal effects
in at least two regions at lower
temperatures,

An apparatus that handles larger
samples and in which the sample is
stirred has also been devised that has
the sensitivity of the differential
method. Although only a few measure-
ments with this apparatus have been
performed, it appears that use of
iron-constantan couples fed directly
to a Micromax recorder will be satis-
factory. This apparatus will be used
in the study of difficult systems such
as those containing BeF,.

X-RAY STUDIES OF COMPLEX
FLUORIDE SYSTEMS

P. Agron, Chemistry Division

The binary NaF-ZrF,, NaZrF -NalFg
systems, and several systems involving
the trivalent uranium fluoride ‘and
possibly a reduced form of ZrF, have
been examined on the x-ray spectrometer.
The trivalent uranium fluoride systems
are at an early stage of development,
and their comprehensive treatment will
require further experiments and study.

Fused mixtures analogous in compo-
sition to compounds found in the Nalb-
UF, system were examined. Interpre-
tation of their x-ray patterns gave
the crystal structures listed in
Table 7.

Na,ZrF,-Na,UF,. The structure of
Na,ZrF, is isomorphous with Na;UF,
(tetragonal; a = 5.45, ¢ = 10.90), It
may safely be inferred from the
similarity of the twocrystal structures
that their solid solutions should
exist. This is confirmed by the
observation that the Na,UF, goes into
the lattice of the Na,ZrF, with the
expected expansion of the crystal
structure of the latter,

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

‘Na,Zr¥,-Na,UF,., The results from
the x-ray study of melts approximating
the formulation of Na,ZrF,, shown in
Table 7, have been grouped together
since detailed diffraction analysis is
lacking at present. Compositions
ranging from 28.5 to 33 mole % ZrF,
show some similarities in their dif-
fraction patterns. At 33 mole % ZrF,,
certain differences in the x-ray
pattern appear when samples are prepared
either under an inert atmosphere, in a
sealed tube, or in large batches in
the hydrofluorinator. At 28 to 29
mole % Zr¥,, additional dissimilarities
are evident when the sample is formed
under an inert atmosphere or obtained
commercially, It seems probable that
solid solutions of NayZrF, and NaZrky
in the Na,ZrF, structure are to some
extent responsible for the variations
observed.

NaZrF, -NaUF,. The crystal structure
of NaZrF, is also isomorphous with
that of NaUF, (hexagonal; a = 14.72,
¢c = 9.76). These compounds should
also form selid solutions with each
other, Detailed information as to
the extent of the mutual solubilities

in the NaZrFg,-NallF; system is of
interest both for the initial loading
and the operation of a reactor using
this type of fuel,

A series of compositions corres-
ponding to 4, 8, and 12 mole % NaUF,
was made by melting NaF, ZrF,, and
UF, in their proper concentrations.
In addition, fused mixtures were
prepared from NaZrFg and NaUFg cor-
responding to 3NaZrF -NaUF,, NaZrF,-
NaUF,, and NaZrF,-3NaUF,. The x-ray
diffraction patterns of the above
materials indicate that the distri-
bution of NaUF, in the lattice of
NaZrF, causes a uniform increase with
concentration in its lattice up to a
region lying between 12 and 25 mole %
NaUFg. The diffraction pattern also
indicates that the major phase present
at 25 mole % is the solid solution of
NaUF; in the NaZrF,; crystal. At the
50 mole % composition both the expanded
lattice of NaZrF, and the contracted
lattice of NaUFg are observed in major
concentrations, demonstrating that two
solid solutions are present in the
solidified melt. The pattern for the
NaZrFg-3NaUF; melt shows that the

SPECTROGRAPHIC ANALYSIS OF FLUORIDES
C, R. Baldock

Stable Isotope Research and Production
Division

The mass spectrometry group 1s now
engaged in making both qualitative and
quantitative examination of reactor
fuels. The qualitative examination 1s
intended to vield only a rough estimate
of the elements and simple compounds
that are volatilized from the fuel
material at temperatures obtainable in
the mass spectrometer ovens, Ton
sources currently in use can heat a
sample of 1 to 2 wgtoabout 1500°C, or
larger amounts, up to 50 mg, to about

700°C. A more recently developed
source oven is satisfactory up to
2100°C. Tons of the base metals are

easily obtained, and it 1s anticipated
that the temperature will be adequate
to produce measurable guantities of
ions from such refractory materials as
the oxides of uranium.

The spectrometer has recently been
employed in the determination of the
contamination of UF, with higher
valence compounds of uranium that

corrected for mutual interference of

over the period of observation. The
ratio of these integrated intensities
over the period of observation yields
the percentage of UFy in UF,. This
resulted in a value of approximately
1%, which is
the chemical estimate for the sample.

SIMULATED FUEL MIXTURE FOR COLD

The fuel compesition for the cold
critical experiment has been based on
a tentative choice of NaF-ZrF,-UF,
(46-50-4 mole %) for the ARE fuel.
The powder fuel base was therefore
established as 68 wt % ZrO, and 21.4
wt % NaF, with 10,6 wt % carbon added
to mock up the moderating effect of
the missing fluoride ions. A large
portion of this work was done in
cooperation with the Y-12 Chemical
Production Division.

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

The chemically pure NaF used con-
tained about 0.1% water and was used
without drying. The hafnium-free (less
than 50 ppm Hf) ZrO, contained about
0.2% water, The carbon was ground in
a micropulverizer before mixing. The
carbon powdar passed 200-mesh screen
and the ZrO, passed 100-mesh screens
before the blending operation, Blend-
ing of the fuel base was accomplished
in two batches of about 200 1b each
by rolling the mixture in a stainless
steel drum for at least 72 hours.
Chemical analysis for Zr0O,, Na, and C
in samples from various locations in
the drum was used to estimate the
degree of homogeneity. The moisture
content of the final fuel base was
less than 0.3%, well below the tolerance
value of 0,5%.

About 225 1b of the fuel mixture
was prepared by addition of enriched
UF, to small amounts of the fuel base
to bring the uranium concentration to
10.19 lb/ft? after the fuel was
packed into stainless steel tubes 1.1
in, ID and 40 in. long. The powder
density of 1.8 was uniform in these
tubes, The 70 fuel elements thus
prepared were sealed by screw caps of
stainless steel.

Sixty coolant tubes of stainless
steel 1/2 in. ID and 40 in. long were
packed to a density of 1.8 with the
fuel base, These tubes were sealed by
inserting stainless steel plugs and
then welding. The remaining fuel base
mixture has been retained for use if it
should be necessary to change the fuel
concentration for another trial.

It is still necessary to load the
one experimental tube with a mixture
of NaF-ZrF,-UF, of high density and
with proper ratios of Na to Zr to U,
All necessary materials are on hand
for this which will be
accomplished by casting fuel slugs to

Most of the work done during the
past guarter has involved the purifi-
cation of sodium and potassium hy-
droxides by methods previously re-
ported, and virtually no experimental
work was done on the development of
new methods of purification.

Production of purified sodium
hydroxide, by removal of Na,CO; from a
50% aqueous solution of NaOH and
subsequent dehydration under vacuum at
450°C, has averaged about 1 1b per
week, The purified hydroxide continues
to be of the same order of purity as
previously reported, (8:7) with the
weight per cent of Na,CO; and of H,0
being less than 0.1.

A batch of lithium hydroxide has
been purified by the method previously
described, (%*7) and the purified hy-
droxide was found to contain signifi-
cantly less carbonate and sodium than
batches previously purified.

Several batches of Sr(OH), have
been purified by the method described
and previously used¢(%'7) for both
Sr(OH), and Ba(OH),. The SrCO; content
of the purified Sr(OH), was found to
be 0.2 to 0.3%, which is higher than

Investigation of nonuranium fluoride
systems of interest as possible coolants
or as a base for preparing fuel mix-
tures has continued. ‘Although ZrF,
was a component of a number of the
systems being considered, the field of
interest was broadened by the addition
of BeF, and AIF; to the list of com-
ponents. Zinc fluoride received very
little attention. Few of the systems
have been investigated thoroughly
encugh to warrant definite conclusions
on their usefulness, but preliminary
tests have not, for the most part,
been very encouraging.

A melting point of 985°C was reported
for the Rb;AlF; compound; the mixture
corresponding to this compound, pre-
pared 1a this laboratory, showed a
melting point of 925°C, The fused
mixture has not been analyzed; so the
reason for the difference is not known
at present. The data obtained on this
entire system, although incomplete,
indicate a eutectic melting at 525°C.
Cooling curves for mixtures containing

explained, at approximately 475°C.

for the binary systems NaF-AlF, and

Neither diagram extends beyond 50 mole

was reported to have a eutectic melting
at 365°C led to a study of the ternary
system, No low-melting-point compo-
sitions have been found among the few
mixtures tested thus far, but the

of two volatile components ina ternary

and of 5 mole % ZrF, to the NaF-AlF,

addition of NaF raised the melting
point of the Na,ZrF, very sharply to a
maximum of 830°C near 25 mole % ZrF,,
which indicates the probable existence
of the compound NazZrF,. The prepa-
ration containing 57 mole % NaF and
43 mole % ZrF, melts at 480°C and
appears to be the lowest melting
composition of this system. This
material expands sufficiently on
solidification to break graphite
crucibles. Neither Na,ZrF, nor NaZrF,
has been found to act this way.

ZrF,-BeF,. Melting points of mix-
tures in the ZrF,-BeF, system were of
interest in connection with the Nak-

were 650, 740, and 825°C, respectively.
These three points, together with the
melting point of ReF, (543°C), made
almost a straight line, The melting
point of ZrF, has not yet been de-
termined, The extrapolation of the

principal uncertainties in the calcu-

experimental errors in the heats of

resulting uncertainties in AF are of
the order of 8 kcal,

the reactor below the liquid led to
considerable contamination of three
batches of product with iron, chromium,
and nickel, Samples prepared in all-
nickel equipment generally show less
than 100-ppm nickel, Careful exami-
nation of the product by chemical
microscopy rarely reveals the presence
of oxides in detectable amounts.

The removal of sulfur by reduction
of oxidized compounds and evolution of
H,S appears quantitative; chemical
analysis reveals no trace of this
element. Although no analytical data
are available, it appears likely that
the traces of chloride present in the
ZrF, presently being used are also
removed.

Preparation of Pure Zirconium
Tetrafinoride. Ease of hydrofluori-
nation of ZrO, by gaseous HF at
elevated temperatures is a function of
previous history of the Zr0O,. Zir-
conium hydroxide may be hydrofluori-
nated quite easily; Zr0O,, which has
been calcined at 800°C or higher,
however, reacts incompletely with HF
at temperatures as high as 700°C even

92

when reaction times of the order of
20 hr are used, (16) Unfortunately,
the hafnium-free product from the Y-12
production plant is purified by pre-
cipitation with phthallic acid and
must be calcined at high temperature
to remove the last traces of carbon.
Accordingly, plans have been made to
produce the hafnium-free ZrF, by
hydrofluorination of ZrCl, prepared
from an oxide by the Bureau of Mines.

The difficulty in obtaining com-
plete reaction of ZrO, with gaseous HF
is probably due to a combination of
several factors. Jt is difficult to
obtain good contact of the gas with
the particulate solid in most apparatus.
The reaction product tends to coat the
surface of the unreacted oxide and
prevent reaction. In addition, high
concentrations of HF are achieved only
at elevated pressures.

In an attempt to improve the con-
version of Zr0, to Zrf,, a series of
experiments in which the reaction is
performed in the liquid state has been
performed. The Zr0,, which had been
calcined at 800°C, was charged, along
with NaF, into a graphite-lined nickel
apparatus similar to the fuel purifi-
cation apparatus previously described.
The HF was admitted at atmospheric
pressure and the temperature was slowly
raised until liquid phase was present,
Evolution of HF accompanied by water
of reaction occurred at temperatures
above 110°C, and the temperature was
slowly raised over a period of 3 to 4
hr until HF evolution ceased at about
500°C. At this stage, HF was bubbled
through the fused-salt mixture con-
taining suspended ZrO, while the
temperature was raised to 800°C and
maintained there for 2 to 3 hours. By
this technique, good contact and high
HF concentrations are assured at the

REACTION OF FUELS WITH ALKALI METALS

The

metals on UF, and ZrF, is well known,
and under proper conditions the free

reducing action of alkali

heavy metals can be produced readily
by this method. However, when rela-
tively small amounts of alkali metal
are added to fluoride mixtures the
reaction proceeds not to the metal but
to a complex series of intermediate
reduction products, including UF.

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1952

On the basis of available thermo-
dynamic estimates, the reduction of
UF, to UF; is more likely than that of
ZrF,. However, when the UF, is dis-
solved in NaF, where strong com-
plexing may occur, and when a large
excess of ZrF, is present, the re-
duction of UF, is not necessarily the
first step in the process. In fact,
preliminary evidence indicates that,
in the presence of excess ZrF,, up
to 40% of the NaK theoretically re-
quired to reduce all the UF, present
may be added without producing detecta-
ble amounts of free UF;.

Although much remains to be learned
about the reaction products of Nak
with ZrF,-bearing fuels, the following
conclusions, typical of material con-
taining 50 mole % NaF, 46 mole % ZrF,,
and 4 mole % UF,, are of interest.

Slow heating of sealed capsules
containing the powdered, purified fuel
with a few weight per cent of NaK shows
that the rapid exothermic reaction
takes place at about 250°C, In a
typical case, 1 g of NaK with 50 g of
fuel yielded a sudden’ temperature in-
crease from 240 to 286°C, The reaction
will, presumably, be very rapid at all
temperatures above 250°C.

Although there is evidence from
other sources that UF, forms compounds
with NaF, KF, and other fluorides, the
bulk of this material formed in such
capsule tests appears on examination
of the cooled melts as pure UF, at the
bottom of the capsules. The solubility
of UF; in the reaction melt at temper-
atures from 600 to 800°C is not vet
known, but it appears to be relatively
low at temperatures well above the
freezing point of the mixture,

If one equivalent of NaK is de-

fined as the guantity required tao

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

of less than 0.4 equivalent produces a
yellowish tinge in the green, solidified
melt, The yellow color replaces the
normal green color of the fuel by the
time 1 equivalent has been added,
Segregated UF, in a yellow matrix
results when 2 equivalents are used;
the solid solution of NaUFy in NaZrFky,
typical of the unreacted fuel, is
considerably altered, and a yellow,
fine-grained phase, some of which
forms a cubic crystal of n = 1.476,
has appeared.

When 4 equivalents are added, the
yellow, cubic phase, a colorless cubic
phase of n = 1,430, considerable UF,,
an opaque phase that may be metal, and
Na,ZrF, appear in the melts. When 8
equivalents are added, the yellow
phase and the solid solution are not
detected. Some Na,ZrF, and the opaque
material are present, and all the
uranium seems to be present as UF,.
The material appears to the eye as a
gray-white matrix containing UF,.

Examination of the cooled and ground
melts for production of H, on reaction
with dilute acids shows that the re-
ducing power is much less than expected
from the amount of NaK added. This is
surprising since UF; yields the theo-
retical volume of H, after similar
grinding and handling in air.

X-ray diffraction studies have indi-
cated that prominent but unidentified
lines have disappeared from spectra
run on the same sample at a later date.
It is possible that a low-valence
compound of zirconium that is unstable
when handled in air may be responsible
for this behavior,

Although it is evident that a sudden
large leak of NaK at elevated tempera-
tures into the fuel stream would have
serious consequences, it is not evident
that a leak small enough to permit

94

chemical equilibrium to be maintained
would be disastrous. If reducing
conditions are desirable in the fuel,
it may be possible, on the basis of
these data, to provide up to 0.2
equivalent of reducing power (fluorine
deficiency) without precipitation of
UF. It may be that the corrosive
behavior of these fuels could be
further improved in this fashion. A
considerable effort will be maintained
on this complex problem.

The need for preparation of small
batches of fluoride mixtures for
standards in x-ray diffraction or

petrographic microscope work, for
enriched uranium fuels, and for other
purposes still exists. About 30

batches of fluoride mixtures ranging
in size from 10 g for enriched uranium
fuels to about 200 g were prepared
during the last quarter. In addition,
various containers were filled with
fluoride mixtures, as shown in Table 9,
Fluoride mixtures were removed from

CORROSION RESEARCH

H., W. Savage, ANP Division

The emphasis in dynamic corrosion
testing in thermal convection loops
has shifted from testing the fuel
NaF-KF-LiF-UF, to testing various
coolants and fuels containing zirconium
fluoride. The coolants and fuels
containing zirconium fluoride are not
so corrosive to Inconel as the NaF-KF-
LiF-UF, fuel. This is probably due
to the more careful preparation and
handling prior to the corrosion tests.
With the zirconium fuels, the corrosion
in the hot leg is approximately 5 mils
after 500 hr of operation compared
with the 10- to 15-mil depth of
corrosion that was previously ex-
perienced.

The effect of different cleaning
procedures on the corrosive action of
the fluorides on Inconel is being
studied. Static tests and modified
dynamic tests have been used to de-
termine the effect of time, tempera-
ture, and various additives on the
corrosion bebavior of the fluorides.
It has been found that most of the
corrosion occurs in the first 500 hr
of operation. Strange results were
obtained in corrosion testing at
extremely high temperatures; the amount
of corrosion appreciably decreased.
This was probably due to the formation
of a thin film of uranium oxide on
the surface of the test capsule. The
additionof strong getters has markedly
decreased the corrosive action of the
fluorides. The most striking example
was the addition of zirconium hydride

to the NaF-KF-L1F-UF, fuel that was

circulated in a thermal convection
loop. Upon examining the thermal
convection loop after 500 hr at 1500°F,
it was found that the loop suffered
the least amount of attack of any
thermal convection loop run with the
fluorides; the maximum depth of attack
was 0,5 mil.

Tests of chemical compatibility of
several possible moderator coolants
with the beryllium oxide moderator
material have shown that Zr¥F,-bearing
melts are not useful in this connection.
Sodium, NaK, and molten lead appear
to be satisfactory, as do fused salts
containing beryllium fluoride.

Tests on the mass transfer properties
of lead have been conducted in which
additions of 3, 5, and 50% sodium
were made to lead. These additions
had a very marked effect on the mass
transfer characteristics and the
corrosive action on the container
materials.

Additional static and dynamic tests
were run in an attempt to find in-
hibitors for the mass transfer and
corrosion exhibited in the metal-
hydroxide systems. Additional tests
have shown that the mass transfer
experienced in nickel-hydroxide
systems can be stopped by the use of
purified hydrogen over the system.

In addition to the program of
empirical corrosion testing, a number
of studies designed to explain the

95
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

corrosion mechanismhas been conducted.
Careful examination by physical and
chemical means has been made of the
corrosion products formed during
large-scale dynamic corrosion tests,
and studies have been made of the
reactions of structural metals with
high-temperature liquids in simple
systems and the possible reactions of
molten fluorides and hydroxides under
applied potentials. A considerable
number of complex fluorides of the
structural metals has been prepared
and characterized to assist in the
identification of corrosion products.
A study of the compounds formed by
the interaction of nickel in the
hydroxides has shown the appearance
of two new compounds, NaNiO, and
LiNiO,. These compounds, which have
been named sodium nickelate(III) and
lithium nickelate(II1I), have been
identified by chemical analysis for
nickel and the alkali metals; by
several chemical reactions, including
a quantitative determination of the
oxidizing power; by the reaction that
gives a known trivalent nickel com-
pound; and by complete crystal structure
analysis.

Metallurgy Division

F. Kertesz

Materials Chemistry Division

The efforts to understand and
minimize fluoride corrosion have
logically led to a study of the many
parameters that enter into corrosion
phenomena and corrosion tests. In-
cluded among these parameters are
temperature of test, length of test,
effect of residual stresses in the

96

corrosion specimen, carbon content of
the specimen, effect of additives,
and effect of pretreatment. Each of
these parameters, except for the
carbon content of the specimen,
affected the corrosion in some measur-
able manner. Additives were both
good and bad, pretreatment was bene-
ficial, and corrosion decreased with
increasing time or temperature.

Temperature of Test (A. des Brasunas,

LL. S. Richardson, D. C. Vreeland,
E. E. Hoffman, R., B. Day, and L. D.
Dyer, Metallurgy Division). Inconel

was tested at a series of temperatures
for 200-hr periods in molten fluoride
NaF-KF-LiF-UF, (10.9-43.5-44.5-1.1
mole %). A rather surprising effect
was noted; at the higher temperatures
void formation became less prominent,
as shown by Fig. 45 and by the data
of Table 10.

The analyses of the fluoride baths,
after the tests, were 1n agreement
with the observations given in Table 10;
in the test at 800°C, 1800 ppm chromium
was detected in the bath, whereas the
fluoride of the test at 1300°C yielded
only 65 ppm chromium. The nature of
the film detected on the Inconel
surface of the high-temperature tests
has been identified as UO, by x-ray
diffraction.

Length of Test. A series of tests
was made to determine the extent of
corrosion as a function of time.
Inconel test specimens were prepared
for testing at several time intervals
ranging up to 3000 hr in the seesaw
test apparatus, 1n which the cold
zone was at about 800°C and the hot
zone at about 650°C.

The test data are summarized in
Table 11 and plotted in Fig. 46.
These data indicate that most of the
corrosion occurs in the first 500 hr;
beyond this time the additional amount
of attack is quite small.

Residual Stresses in Specimen.
From quench-annealed flat stock a
series of cold-worked Inconel speci-
mens were prepared that ranged from
0 to 71% reduction in thickness.
These specimens were then corrosion
tested in NaF-KF-LiF-UF, for 100 hr
at 815°C to determine possible differ-
ences in corrosion behavior. The
test results listed in Table 12 show
that there is a small, but never-
theless perceptible, effect.

1952

There appears to be maximum cor-
rosion in the range of 5 to 25%
reduction in thickness. Such results
are not surprising, since hole for-
mation, which is believed to be caused
by the diffusion of chromium from the
metal into the fluoride bath, is
accelerated by the presence of cold
work. The recrystallization tempera-
ture range for Inconel is about 1500°F,
which is the test temperature, and
hence heavily cold-worked specimens
recrystallize in a relatively short
time. Therefore specimens that have
not been cold worked and specimens
that have been heavily cold-worked
may be essentially stress free for
most of the period of the corrosion
test, and the intermediate stress
range may not result in recrystal-
lization throughout the exposure
period.

Carbon Content of Specimen. To
establish the effect of carbon content,
1f any, on the corrosion behavior of
face-centered~cubic metals in NaF-KF-
LiF-UF,, two seesaw test specimens
were run simultaneously so that
identical time and temperatures would

namely, 5 mils of void formation in
the hot zones of both. No attack or

Corrosion Imhibitors. Static and
dynamic corrosion tests at 816°C for
100 hr have been continued with
various agents being added to check
the possibility of the additions
acting as corrosion inhibitors.
Particular attention was given to
additions of chromium because of the
part chromium plays in the fluoride
paragraph

»

corrosion of Inconel (cf.,
on *Mechanism of Fluoride Corrosion,
this section). Tests have been run
with 0.17% additions of sodium (previous
addition tests were with higher
percentages of sodium) and also ad-
ditions of Mn0O,, CrF,, NiF,, and FeF,.
In the case of the sodium addition
and also in the previous tests with
additions of lithium, potassium,
calcium, titanium, and manganese, 1it
was thought that these elements might
possibly act as getters to reduce the
available amount of oxygen in the
system and thus help to reduce cor-
rosion. The MnO, additions were made
to determine whether oxygen added to
these tests in this form would in-
crease corrosion.

100

The metal fluorides (and also
sodium, lithium, and potassium) were
added with the thought that perhaps a
reaction of the following typemight be
the corrosion mechanism:

2qF + Bf —= BF, + 2a ,

where a could
lithium,

represent sodium,
or potassium and S could
represent iron, nickel, or chromium.
If this were the case, then additions
of iron, nickel, or chromium fluorides
and also sodium, lithium, or potassium
should tend to drive the above re-
action to the left and help reduce the
corrosion. However, additions of the
iron, nickel, and chromium fluorides
had no effect in reducing corrosion.
It should be mentioned that the purity
of the salts used is not known. Ad-
ditions of sodium, lithium, and
potassium do seem to reduce corrosion,
but, as mentioned above, their action
may be that of getters rather than
that of participators in the reaction.

In Table 13, the additions (in both
the previous and the most recent
tests) are classified according to the
results of the tests. It should be
emphasized that the classifications
are based on tests that were run with
certain percentages of these addition
agents, and 1t 1s conceivable that
different amounts might result in
different corrosion results, Table 14
shows the results of the most recent
tests in which addition agents were
used. The beneficial effect of the
addition of 1/4% chromium to the
fluoride bath is demonstrated in
Fig. 47, which shows the corrosion of
Inconel by NaF-KF-LiF-UF, with and
without the chromium additive. The
absence of subsurface voids when
chromium is added agrees with the
hypothesis that the voids are caused
by chromium depletion of the metal
by the fluorides,

Pretreatment. In an attempt to
evaluate the influence of the pre-
treatment procedure, parallel dynamic
tests of material containing NaF-XF-
ZrF,-UF, (36.6~14.0-45.6-3.8 mole %)
were made with samples prepared in
graphite and in nickel containers
without hydrofluorination and in
nickel containers with hydrogenation
and hydrofluorination. The material
that had been hydrofluorinated was
somewhat superior, although in these
tests no marked differences were
noted.

In other tests the fluoride mixture
NaF-KF-LiF-UF, was treated by bubbling
hydrogen through it for 2 hr while the
molten fluoride was held at a tempera-
ture of approximately 980°C. There
appeared to be no significant re-
duction in corrosion of Inconel,
type 321 stainless steel, or 4 nickel
when the hydrogen-pretreated fluoride
was used.

Ten different ZrF,-bearing fused
salts ranging from 58 to 44 mole %
ZrxF,, 0 to 52 mole % NaF, 0 to 46
mole % KF, and 0 to 4 mole % UF, have
been tested in sealed capsules of
type 316 stainless steel and Inconel
under static and dynamic conditions.
The static tests were maintained for
100 hr at B00O°C. The dynamic tests
were performed with the tilting
furnace previously described;(!? the
hot-zone temperature of 800°C and the
cold-zone temperature of 650°C were
maintained for 100 hr, during which
time the fuel made 24,000 cycles.

Comparison of results from the two
test procedures substantiates previous
statements that corrosion, as measured
by penetration, 1s significantly
greater in the dynamic test and that
mass transfer of small quantities of
metal is often observed in the dynamic
tests. However, even the dynamic
tests are not sufficiently severe to
permit evaluation of small differences
in corrosion behavior.

The zirconium-bearing fluoride
mixtures were shown to be less cor-
rosive than previously tested NaF-KF-
LiF-UF, mixtures. Variation of
corresiveness with composition over
the concentration ranges listed above
could not be ascertained with accuracy.
In general, corrosion in each case
(as indicated by penetration data)
was scattered and the depth of attack
ranged from 0.5 to 2 mils on Inconel,

changes of the specimens after test
were slight and metal dissolution
in the fuels was less than with fuel
mixtures tested previously. Slight
penetration or surface roughening was
found in the hot zones of the capsules,
and occasional small metallic deposits
were observed in the cold zones. The
corrosion observed appeared independent
of the UF, concentration over the
range studied.

In a series of static exposures of
Inconel to NaF-Zrlt,-UF, mixtures for
100 hr at 1000°C the only corrosion
observed was a slight surface deposit
similar to that observed at lower
temperatures. Tests at higher tempera-

FLUORIDE CORROSION IN THERMAL
CONVECTION LOOPS

G. M. Adamson, Metallurgy Division

The emphasis in dynamic corrosion
testing has shifted from testing
NaF-KF-LiF-UF, to testing various
coolants containing zirconium fluoride.
As a class, the zirconium fluoride
coolants are less corrosive to Inconel.
The method of attack appears to be the
same for the two types. The zirconium
fluoride coolants do have the dis-
advantage of a high vapor pressure
that results in the sublimation of

Some work 1s still being done with
the mixture NaF-KF-LiF-UF, because it

easier to discern. A portion of
the work has been on the addition of
possible inhibitors to the coolants.
From the results obtained with a

reduce corrosion, but the effect of
NaK 1s questionable. Corrosion from

the fluorides appears to increase if
crevices are present in the loop walls.

Tables 15 and 15, which summarize
the results obtained from the thermal
convection loops operated during this
period, are continuations of Tables 12
and 13 in the previous report. (2)
Even with the additional fluids being
tested, none of the data in these
tables conflict with the conclusions
presented in the last report.

Fluoride Mixtures Containing ZrF,.
As shown in Table 15, four additional
fluoride mixtures containing zirconium
fluoride have been tested in Inconel
loops. The hot-leg attack in every
one of these loops is less than that
normally found with NaF-KF-LiF-UF,
fuel. Since loop 234 was cleaned
only by degreasing, which previously
was the standard procedure, it can be
compared with the standard loops.
The maximum attack in this loop was
only 5 mils rather than the 10 to 15
mils normally found with the earlier
fuel composition, The amount of
attack was also greatly reduced, as
shown in Fig. 48. Some of the other
loops in which the zirconium fluoride
fuels and coolants were circulated did
show a maximum attack greater than
10 mils. As discussed below, the
attack seems to be more a function of
the cleaning procedure than of the
mixture.

There does not appear to be much
variation in the attack by the various
since all
produced about the same attack under
comparable conditions. The attack
was about the same as that shown in
Fig. 54 of the previous report, (3)
which illustrated attack by a mixture

containing ZrF,. Even though the
number of loops run with these mixtures
is limited, the attack mechanism
seems to be the same as the process of
leaching and diffusion of chromium,
which was discussed previously(*) in
connection with the NaF-KF-LiF-UF,
fuel,

The expansion pots of two Inconel
loops in which NaF-ZrF,-UF, was
circulated for 500 hr were cut open
and over 200 g of sublimed zirconium
fluoride was recovered from each.
The material was found both on the
insulated sides and exposed top of
this chamber. The area of the surface
from which this material escaped was
only 7.4 in.?, and the surface was at
a temperature of about 1300°F. In
general, large crystals were found on
the sides and small ones on the top.
This vaporization and subsequent
sublimation of the ZrF, fluoride is a
major problem in the handling of these
mixtures (cf., “Experimental Engi-
neering,” sec. 2).

Effect of Cleaning Loops. The
standard procedure for cleaning thermal
convection loops before operation has
been vapor degreasing and flushing
with a fresh organic solvent, This
procedure was felt to be more desirable
than pickling because of the variables
introduced by pickling, even though
it does not remove the thin oxide
layers at the welds. Heating in a
dry-hydrogen atmosphere seemed to be
a possible method for reducing these
oxides without attacking the metal.
This operation was tried on several
Inconel loops in which the zirconium-
bearing fluorides and the earlier
nonzirconium-bearing fluorides were
circulated. The corrosion results
were all comparable, no matter which
fluoride mixture was later circulated.
From this it 1s apparent that the

cleaning cycle is just as important
as the choice of fluoride mixture.
Comparison of these loops with similar
loops that have only been degreased
shows that the amount of attack, as
indicated by the number of holes, is
reduced. The attack is concentrated
in a few grain boundaries and actually
extends to a greater depth. This is
shown by Fig. 54 in the previous
report. (3) In cleaning with hydrogen,
temperatures in excess of 1850°F are
necessary to provide a minimum temper-
ature above 1750°F. These temperatures
cause grain growth and possibly concen-
tration of impurities in the grain
boundaries. Since hydrogen firing did
cut down the amount of attack, a
method of removing the oxide without

the resulting grain growth would be
desirable.

It was found that NaK at 1500°F
would remove weld scale from Inconel.
Therefore several Inconel loops were
cleaned by heating the hot leg to
1600 °F and the cold leg to 1500°F and
circulating NaK for 4 hours. The NaK
was drained while still hot, and the
loops were then heated and evacuated
to remove any remaining NaK. The one
loop examined showed attack as deep
as would be obtained by degreasing,
or even deeper. It seems likely that
when the NaK was drained, sodium or
potassium oxides were left behind in
cold spots, or possibly some oxides
were deposited in the cold leg by the

method of cleaning will be checked
further and other methods will be
tried.

Corrosion Inhibiirors. In the
static corrosion studies 1t was shown
that the addition of zirconium metal
to NaF-KF-LiF-UF, reduced the attack.
Because of the great affinity of
zirconium metal for the various gases
and the difficulties in obtaining
adequate mixing, it was not practical
to add the zirconium metal to a loop
either before or after heating.
Zirconium hydride was also tried as a
possible inhibitor because 1t does
not decompose until slightly below
operating temperature, and the nascent
hydrogen liberatedduring decomposition
might helpin cleaningup the fluorides.

The NaF-KF-LiF-UF, with 1/2% ZrH,
added was circulated in an Inconel
loop for 500 hr at 1500°F. After
circulation, the hot leg was found to
have a roughened surface but the
attack extended only to a depth of
0.5 mil; the surface is shown in
Fig. 49. The attack was the least
found in any loop in which fluorides
have been circulated. In the hot
leg, some precipitated crystals were
observed just under the surface and
in the grain boundaries. These
crystals do not seem to be continuous
enough to act as a protective layer.
An adherent metallic layer about 0.2
mil thick was found in the cold leg.
The lack of corrosion in this loop
was further evidenced by the very low
amounts of impurities in the fluorides.
This test is now being repeated, and

the effect of a zirconium hydride
addition to a zirconium-base fluoride
fuel 1s also being studied.

It was pointed out in the previous
report¢5) that a small NaK addition
reduced the corrosion obtained when
nonuranium-bearing coolants were used.
As an extension of this work, NaK was
added to two other Inconel loops.
Loop 224 was used to circulate NaF-KF-
LiF-UF,, and Loop 241 to circulate
NaF-ZrF,-UF,. About 8 cc of NaK was
added to each loop. In both loops
the NaK was placed in the pot and the
fluorides were added to it. Loop 224
was started without difficulty and
operated satisfactorily for 500 hours.
The maximum hot-leg attack measured
10 mils, which lower than the
usual average but not enough to show
a definite effect. However, since the
metallic impurities found in the
fluorides after circulation were also
lower than normal, it seems possible
that some actual improvement took
place. Loop 241 1s now operating
satisfactorily, but there was con-
siderable difficulty in start-up,
which may have been due to a reaction
that yielded some solid precipitates.
The cold~leg temperatures were lower
than normal and kept decreasing.

Crevice Corrosion. Crevice cor-
rosion has been observed but requires
further investigation. In an Inconel
pump loop operated with NaF-KF-LiF
(11.5-42.0-46.5 mole %) very little
attack was found in most of the loop,
but heavy attack was found 1n two
different types of crevices. One type
of crevice resulted from sleeves
joining pipe sections and the other
from a thermocouple well. This loop
had operated for about 1000 hr at
1250 °F and below and 100 hr at 1500°F.

Several other loops were then
checked for crevice corrosion by
examining the top welds. The corrosion
of crevices found in the hot legs of
loops 219, 229, and 234 is compared in
Table 17 with the corrosion of the
wall directly opposite the crevice.
Figure 50 shows a section through the
Joint of Inconel loop 219. It should
be pointed out that the attack in
this portion of the hot leg is con-
siderably less than that given in
Table 15, since the sections were at
slightly different temperatures. One
additional piece of evidence for the
existence of crevice corrosion is the
fact that the attack at the mouth of

this effect will be.

Temperature Variations, To de-
termine the effect of temperature
on the corrosion of Inconel, two
loops (218 and 222) were run at 1300

apparent that the attack increased
slightly with temperature. The type

ature.

it could be the small temperature
difference that caused the plugging.

loop 78 was constructed of Inconel
and circulated NaF-KF-LiF for 500
hours. In the first loop(®> the
variations in chemical composition
appeared to be the same as those
found in loop 78, but in loop 78 they
were much smaller. Chromium was
depleted to a depth of at least 25 mils.
Since the fluoride content was low and
constant, it was evident that there
was practically no penetration.

In the type 316 stainless steel
loop, chromium was reduced slightly,
and the iron was the major material
leached out. The nickel and molybdenum

contents were essentially unchanged.

In this loop the fluoride content was
much higher than in the other loops
and decreased gradually with depth.
Evidently the fluorides are trapped
in crevices. A loop in which zirconium-
bearing fluoride mixtures will be
circulated 1s being prepared.

Postrun Examination of Fuels (D. C.
Hoffman, F. F. Blankenship, Materials
Chemistry Division). Examination of
sections from a number of thermal
convection loops operated by the
experimental engineering group 1n
which zirconium-bearing fluoride
fuels were circulated in loops of
type 316 stainless steel and Inconel
has been accomplished by the method
and techniques previously described. (7)
The results of these investigations
are briefly summarized in the following
statements.

The zirconium-bearing fluoride
fuels show considerably less corrosion
and mass than the fuels
tested previously. No NaK,-CrF, has
been discovered in the loops run with
these fuels. Inconel seems generally
superior to stainless steel.

COMPATIBILITY OF BERYLLIUM OXIDE
WITH VARIOUS FLUORIDE MIXTURES

R. E. Meadows

Materials Chemistry Division

H. J. Buttram

In the present ARE design a liquid
heat transfer agent will be pumped
slowly through the moderator space to
maintain a uniform temperature in the
beryllium oxide. The flow rate of
this liquid past the beryllium oxide
blocks should be at most a few feet
per minute. The number and irregular
shapes of the beryllium oxide speci-
mens would seem to preclude canning
or electroplating of the pieces. One
of the essential characteristics of
the moderator coolant therefore is
chemical compatibility with the
beryllium oxide.
FOR PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10,

Small specimens sawed from hot-
pressed beryllium oxide blocks typical
of those proposed for use in the ARE
have been used in these studies.
These pieces have been exposed for
100 hr in sealed capsules of type 316
stainless steel to molten alkali
fluorides with and without ZrF, or
BeF,.(®) In all static tests the
temperature was maintained at B00°C;
in all the dynamic capsule tests the
capsule was tilted every 15 sec, with
the cold end at 650°C and the hot end
at 800°C. :

Preliminary studies of the behavior
of beryllium oxide in a static bath
of molten NaF -KF-Zrf, (5-52-43 mole %)

was appreciable but that it decreased

film of ZrO, might make it possible
to use a coolant containing zirconium.
Exposure of the blocks for longer
times in static tests and for 100-hr
intervals in dynamic tests,
clearly demonstrated that zircomium-
bearing mixtures are not suitable in
contact with beryllium oxide. Data
shown in Table 20 are representative
of those obtained. The attack seems
to be due to a uniform dissolution of
beryllium oxide, since the corners
and sharp edges of the specimens are
retained.

however,

as the data in Table 20
systems of alkali fluorides
containing BeF, are compatible with
beryllium oxide. Microscopic and
x-ray examination of specimens crushed
after dynamic testing show Bel, in the
body of the beryllium oxide block.
The penetratien, which appears to do
no damage, is undoubtedly responsible
for the weight gain observed. Further
studies of the BeO-BeF,-alkali fluoride
systems are being made,

The effectiveness of a hydrogen
atmosphere in inhibiting hydroxide
corrosion was demonstrated previ-
ously?) in at least two independent
tests. Recent tests in a thermal
gradient apparatus have substantiated
the results. Furthermore, addition of
the reducing agent, sodium hydride,
has reduced mass transfer in an
Inconel system tested with potassium
hydroxide. A series of temperature-
dependence tests indicated that the
corrosion of Inconel by sodium hydroxide
is negligible up to 450°C; more ex-
tensive tests at 600°C gave evidence
of severe attack. Corrosion tests of
a stressed specimen indicated in-
creased corrosion.

Temperature of Test. A series of
temperature-dependence testsof Inconel
in sodium hydroxide has been completed.
From the results listed in Table 21,
it would appear that in 100-hr tests,
corrosion of Inconel 1s negligible
until the test temperature 1s raised

to above 450°C.

REPORT

Nickel was tested similarly in
sodium hydroxide at a series of hot-
zone temperatures ranging from about
400 to 800°C, This was done in the
hope of finding a threshold tempera-
ture below which no mass transfer
occurs. However, the results indicated
that as the maximum temperature was
diminished, the amount of nickel
crystals in the cold zone was di-
minished; mass transfer was not
eliminated.

More extensive corrosion data are
available at 600°C, at which tempera-
ture a variety of materials was
subjected to 100-hr exposures to
sodium hydroxide. These data are
summarized in Table 22, Crystal-bar
zirconium was heavily attacked even
at this temperature, although 1t is
possible that the canning in type 347
stainless steel may have adversely
affected its behavior. Of the alloys
tested, Monel showed the least cor-
rosion. It is obvious that the use of
these alloys with sodium hydroxide
under an inert atmosphere is not
possible.

Residual Stresses in Specimen,
Tests have been run to check the
effect of residual stresses on the
corrosion resistance of Inconel in
sodium hydroxide at 816°C. The stresses
were induced by cold rolling. The
tests were first run for 50 hr, but

run on A nickel for 50 hr, but there
was no evidence of attack even on the
most severely cold worked (71% re-
duction in area) specimens tested.

of mass transfer was evident after

tures were measured by spot-welded

studies of mass transfer with small melt. In 40 hr a copious quantity of

thermal convection loops indicated
that a hydrogen atmosphere had an
appreciable effect in reducing nickel
mass transfer. This effect was more
closely investigated with the thermal
convection apparatus described in the
last report.¢!1) A number of ex-
periments has been performed with
this apparatus. The results are
illustrated by two typical tests.
In both tests the temperature of the
nickel cup was about 725°C, whereas
the temperature of the inner nickel
tube was 525°C, a temperature difference
of 200 degrees.

The first test was conducted with
a static vacuum over the hydroxide

dendritic nickel crystalshad encrusted
the inner nickel tube and extended
more than half way across the hydroxide
melt. This 1s a case of normally
expected nickel mass transfer in sodium
hydroxide for a large temperature
difference. In the second test a
purified hydrogen atmosphere replaced
the static vacuum. In 170 hr, as
compared with 40 hr for the first
test, the only evidence of mass transfer
obtained was a tiny band of nickel
crystals on the inner nickel tube at
the gas-liquid interface. This band
was about 1 mm wide and 0.1 mm thick.

Confirmatory evidence for the
inhibiting effect of hydrogen was
also obtained with the tilting-furnace
apparatus. The test with nickel and

ature of about 750°C and a cold- zone

of about 1 atm was maintained. This
represents a very appreciable re-
duction in mass transfer when compared
with tests made under similar con-
ditions in vacuum.

The desirability of lead as a
coolant is largely offset by its
susceptibility to mass transfer and
its attack on most commercially
available heat-resistant alloys.
The use of a lead-sodium mixture
would be advantageous if it possessed
predominately the corrosion character-
istics of the sodium and the radio-
active characteristics of the lead.
Tests indicate that the corrosiveness
of lead 1s diminished with the ad-
dition of increasing amounts of
sodium, In other corrosion tests
with lead, the mass transfer phenomenon
and the effect of temperature have
been examined further. Sodium cor-
rosion was measured in the “spinner”
test in a new, revolving, corrosion
apparatus. Testsof type 1020 chromi zed
steel in various low-melting-point
alloys show that this steel cannot be
recommended as a container for the
alloys tested. In addition, the
compatibility of beryllium oxide with
such probable moderator coolants as
lead, sodium, and NaK is being in-
vestigated.

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1952

Mass Transfer in Liquid Lead.
Studies are being undertaken of the
mass transfer of molybdenum and Inconel
in liquid lead. Preliminary to the
corrosion studies, research has been
conducted on the handling and purifi-
cation of liquid lead, and a few mass
transfer measurements have been made.
Since molybdenum is difficult to weld
and oxidizes excessively at high
temperatures, the molybdenum corrosion
tests were conducted on specimens of
the metal in convection loops made
of quartz or pyrex. These materials
are resistant to corrosion by lead(!?)
and do not present the problem of a
bimetallic system.

Studies were made of the de-
oxidation of high-purity lead. From
the quantity of oxide that collected
on the surface of lead melted under
purified hydrogen, it was concluded
that the original material had con-
tained a considerable amount of
occluded oxide. A number of ex-
periments was performed in which
hydrogen was passed in fine bubbles
formed by a fritted pyrex disk through
molten lead at 450 to 500°C for 20
hr, and the lead was then filtered
through a fritted pyrex disk. There
were no visible oxide films on the
surface of the filtered lead, but a
small amount of oxide was found on
the filter. This indicated that the
hydrogen reduction had not been
complete. Further studies of the
conditions required for complete
reduction by hydrogen will be made.

No results of the corrosion of
either molybdenum or Inconel in the
convection loops have yet been ob-
tained because of difficulties as-
sociated with the operation of such

loops. However, a preliminary ex-
periment was performed to determine
whether there 1s mass transfer of
molybdenum during temperature cycling
in the manner reported(!3?) for copper
in bismuth. A mechanically polished
molybdenum specimen, contained in lead,
was cycled every 12 min for 42 hr
between 500 and 510°C. At the end of
the test period the lead was filtered
at 500°C. No mass transfer crystals
were found. This result should be
taken as preliminary because the
molybdenum was undoubtedly coated with
an oxide film that may have prevented
contact with the molten lead.

Spinner Tests with Sodium. The
spinner test, designed to supply

corrosion data, has been used for two

bath and a rotating shaft with speci-
men holders that extend into the pot.
The spinner is equipped with a gas-
tight cover so that an inert gas
atmosphere can be contained during

ceased reacting. In the test the

FUNDAMENTAL CORROSION RESEARCH

In addition to the program of
empirical corrosion testing, con-
siderable effort has been devoted to
a number of studies designed to assist
in the discovery of the corrosion
mechanism. These studies include the
synthesis and identification of cor-
rosion products and studies of re-
actions in fluorides and hydroxides
under applied potentials. Of particular

for various periods followed by
filtration at high temperature. The
concentration of structural elements
in the filtrate is then determined by
chemical analysis.

Previous examination(13) indicated
that little (20 to 100 ppw) chromium
and nickel and large amounts (1500 to
3000 ppm) of iron were solubilized by
a 6-hr treatment of type 316 stainless
steel with the NalF-KF-LiF eutectic at
800°C. Parallel tests have shown that
exposure for 72 hr raised the chromium
and nickel values slightly (40 to
400 ppm) without perceptible increase
in iron concentration. The amount of
reaction required to produce soluble
products appears similar when structures
of graphite or nickel as the
reaction vessel. There 1s some in-
dication that the values for nickel
and chromium are slightly higher when
filtration is performed at 600 rather
than 800°C. It was reported previously
that when the NaF-KF-LiF eutectic
contained added UF,, the iron content
of the filtrate rose to 6000 to 7000 ppm
and the amount of soluble chromium

serve

increased to 500 to 2000 ppm. When
metallic 1ron is exposed to the
eutectic mixture at 800°C, 1500 to
2500 ppm of 1ron appears 1n the
filtrate. The dissolved iron seems
to be trivalent in all cases. When
chromium powder is used, 150 to 450

ppm of the element 1s solubilized.
Examination of the cooled filtrate
indicates the presence of NaK,Crk.
However, when materials that have

corrosion tests are recovered, filtered,
and analyzed, a different pattern is
revealed.

of iron without an appreciable in-
crease in solubility of the other
elements may, perhaps, be due to the
deposition of iron by the mass transfer
mechanism. Experiments of this type
will be continued.

Synthesis of Complex Fluorides

(B. J. Sturm, L. G. Overholser,
Materials Chemistry Division). There
has been no indication of simple

fluorides of the structural elements
in the fluoride mixtures following
interaction of the melts with the
containers. However, the presence of
NaK,CrF, has been confirmed, and it
is not unlikely that more sensitive
means of detection will show the
presence of other complex fluorides.
The preparation of complex fluorides
has continued as an aid in identifying
the various materials formed during
static and dynamic corrosion tests,
The complex fluorides synthesized
in these studies have been identified
or characterized by x-ray diffraction
patterns and/or by optical crystal-
lographic data.

It has been demonstrated that
NaK,CrF, is the only stable complex
fluoride of sodium, potassium, and
trivalent chromium, Attempts to
prepare complexes of other proportions
resulted in mixtures containing

NaK,CrF and either NaF or KF.

Fusion of various fluorides in
ratios corresponding to LiK,CrF,,
Li,KCrF,, Na,LiCrF,, and NalLi,CrF,
yielded products with characteristic
x-ray diffraction pattern, indicating
that each is probably a definite
compound. In addition, materials
that should correspond to the com-
pounds RbK,CrF, and CsK,CrF, have
x-ray patterns similar to that of
NaK,CrF., but they show slight shifts
of the lines that indicate somewhat
different lattice constants.

K,FeF, has been precipitated by
slow addition of KF in aqueous so-
lution in less than stoichiometric
quantity to an aqueous solution of
FeCl, acidified with HF. K Fel may
be prepared by fusion of K,FeF, with
KHF, or by fusion of KF with NH, FeF,.
The optical properties of these
preparations agree with those of
K,FeF,, which is prepared by addition
of aqueous FeF, to aqueous solutions
of KF, as described in the litera~
ture.{1%) Fusion of K,FeF, with NaHF,
yields NaK,FeF,, which appears to be
isomorphous with NaK,CrF..

Hydrated KNiF, is formed when
proper quantities of aqueous KF so-
lution are added to NiF, in aqueous
hydrofluoric acid solution. Fusion of
a mixture of KHF, with hydrated NiF,
and subsequent extraction with water
yields a yellow powder that corre-
sponds, by chemical analysis, to
K,NiF,. The analogous complex com-
pounds of LiF and NaF are prepared in
a similar manner. The x-ray data from
this series of materials are

Compositions corresponding to K,MnF,

of pure compounds after fusion. Other
materials prepared in similar fashion

Since only NaK,CrF, has been
positively identified in the products
of corrosion and since many other
compounds are readily formed from the
corresponding fluorides, 1t might be
surmised that complex compounds of the

EMF Measurements in Fused Fluorides
(L. E. Topol, L. G. Overholser,
Materials Chemistry Division). De-
composition potential measurements
inmolten fluorides have been continued.
Whereas previous work dealt with the
electrolysisof KF atnickel electrodes,
subsequent work deals with the effects
of additions of small amounts of NiF,
(approximately 0.3 wt %) to the KF.
Containers of graphite, magnesia,
and alumina were used. Graphite is
advantageous in that it is fairly
stable in the presence of fused
fluorides but is disadvantageous. in
that it is an electrical conductor.

The plot of E vs. I was a straight
line through the origin and yielded a
resistance of 0.7 ohm when magnesia
was used as the container. In this
test neither electrode changed in
appearance, but the amount of nickel
formed in the cell was greater than
could be accounted for by simple
electrochemical processes. The
magnesia vessel absorbed the molten
fluoride and cracked in numerous
places.

containers tried despite the slow
dissolution of the Al,0; by the fused
fluorides. The degree to which this

The significance of the breaks in the
voltage-current curves is difficult to
ascertain because the dissolution of
Al1,0, complicates the picture. and
because there 1s evidence that the

temperatures used (850 to 900°C).

The thermal decomposition of NiF,
appears impossible based on thermo-
dynamic considerations (AF = 120 kcal
and the equilibrium partial pressure
of F, = 10°23 atm(!7)). However, the
nickel formation in the
electrolysis experiments suggested
that decomposition was occurring and
led to experiments that verified it.

Electrochemistry of Sodium Hydroxide
(A. BR. Nichols, Materials Chemistry

galvanic potentials were made to study
the mechanisms of corrosion and metal
transport in fused hydroxide systems.
These measurements were made by de-
termining the potential between two
nickel electrodes maintained at
different known temperatures in a melt
of sodium hydroxide in the apparatus
described previously.¢!8) Since the
voltage developed by the thermo-
galvanic cell depends upon the temper-
ature difference between the electrodes
and also upon the part of the tempera-
ture scale 1n which the cell 1s
operated, the results are conveniently

expressed by plotting the quantity

Q = E/AT, in millivolts per degree,
against the mean of the electrode
temperatures. The hotter electrode
was negative in these trials.

Although curves showing some
features in common were obtained under
an atmosphere of purified helium,
erratic changes in potential were
observed, whether hydrogen-fired or
untreated nickel electrodes were used.
However, when a hydrogen atmosphere
was used, the results were fairly
reproducible.

Figure 51 shows the result of a
trial in which the charge consisted of
sodium hydroxide and approximately
0.2 mole % nickel oxide. It is noted
that a maximum value of § of between
0.8 and 0.9 is maintained over a range
from approximately 400 to 600°C, with
a gradual decrease to about 0.2 at a
temperature above 750°C. These values
do not change appreciably with time;
it is possible to retrace the curve
through a cooling and a second heating
and cooling, with good agreement.
Trials with a helium atmosphere, in
addition to giving less smooth and
reproducible curves, showed gross
changes with time and gave generally
higher Q values in the higher temper-
ature range.

Temperature Gradient.

In addition to the trials in which
nickel oxide was added, several trials
were made with sodium hydroxide alone.
With hydrogen-fired electrodes and a
helium atmosphere, it was found that
the valueof Q was erratic and actually
reversed its sign occasionally, which
indicated that the cold electrode
became negative. When this experiment
was carried out in hydrogen, the value
of Q became negative after an initial
positive interval, during which,
presumably, traces of oxide were
removed from the electrodes, and
remained slightly negative during
successive heating and cooling cycles.

It is evident that if some form of
dissolved nickel, represented in these
experiments by the added nickel oxide,
is present in molten sodium hydroxide,
which is in contact with nickel
surfaces at different temperatures, a
potential will develop that is of the
proper sign to correspond to oxidation
(attack) of the nickel metal at the
hot surface and to reduction (de-
position) of nickel at the cooler
surface.

The process may be represented by
the following equations:

Ni (metal) —> (Ni**) + 2 electrons

(at hot surface) ,

(Ni**) + 2 electrons—> Ni (metal)

(at cold surface) .

Since little is known of the actual
state of the nickel in these melts,
the term (Ni**) must be interpreted
as being some ion containing divalent
nickel in a form capable of electro-
chemical equilibrium with metallic
nickel.

The experiment with sodium hydroxide
containing no added nickel oxide and
a hydrogen atmosphere showed that
under these conditieonsno concentration
of dissolved ionic nickel develops

125
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

and, hence, no potential corresponding
to metal transport is observed. The
potential of opposite sign that was
observed hasnot been clearly accounted
for. It would appear to be dependent
upon some process involving the hy-
drogen and sodium hydroxide, with the
nickel electrodes serving only as
carriers for the hydrogen gas and thus
acting as hydrogen electrodes.

The measurement of the thermo-
galvanic potential appears to offer a
fundamental method of studying the
sodium hydroxide system apart from
any participation by the electrode
metal 1tself., It 1s significant in
relation to the corrosion and metal
transport processes that the use of a
hydrogen atmosphere cleans up traces
of nickel oxide and leaves the melt
free of dissolved nickel and hence
incapable of developing the potential
corresponding to metal transport.

The work described establishes the
existence of thermogalvanic potentials
between nickel electrodes in fused
sodium hydroxide containing dissolved
nickel oxide. The potentials have
been shown to be of such sign and
magnitude as to be capable of accounting
for transport of metallic nickel
in nonisothermal nickel systems in
which fused sodium hydroxide 1s
circulated,

Mechanism of Fluoride Corrosion
(A. des Brasunas, L. S. Richardson,

tests intended to give a better
understanding of fluoride corrosion
has been completed. The postulate

subsurface voids encountered during
fluoride corrosion are caused by the

vacant lattice sites that *‘precipi-
tate” to form voids, has been sub-
stantiated repeatedly. It has been
demonstrated when chromium 1s re-
moved from the metal lattice by either
high-temperature oxidation or high-
temperature vacuum treatment. Con-
versely, corrosion tests made with
fluoride containing small amounts of
chromium powder have shown that void
formation can be suppressed. The
basis for this conclusion may be
briefly summarized as follows:

polishing, it has never been possible

2, Chemical analysis of the at-

3. The chromium content of the

comparison with the nickel and iron
contents, which indicated a preferential
solution of chromium from the alloy.

5. Depth of void formation bears
a direct relationship to the amount

6. Attacked specimens show weight

7. Chromium loss from the alloy
caused by either high-temperature
oxidation or high-temperature vacuum
treatment has also resulted in similar
void fermation.

8. Such voids have been observed

periments in which diffusion in one
direction exceeded the extent of
diffusion in the opposite direction.

9. The addition of small amounts
of chromium powder to saturate the
fluoride bath with chromium has
prevented void formation under con-
ditions that otherwise favor void
development,

10. Fluorine is not detected
below the metal surface.

The porous surface region of an
Inconel metal specimen before and
after exposure to molten fluoride 1s
shown in Fig. 52. Many of the voids,
especially those not in grain bound-
aries, have definite shapes that bear
a relationship to the metal lattice.
The inclusions shown in Fig. 52 are
convenient sites for the deposition of
vacancies; two such sites may be seen.
The corrosion of Inconel by air is
known to form a chromium-rich oxide
layer at elevated temperatures. In
a 200-hr exposure to air at 1200°C
(2192°F), the region beneath the oxide
layer of an Inconel specimen was found
to contain voids similar to those
observed in fluoride-attacked Inconel

(Fig. 53).

The high vapor pressure of chromium
relative to that of iron or nickel
suggests that high-temperature vacuum
treatment would also be a suitable
means of removing chromium. Inconel
and an 80% Ni~-20% Cr alloy were exposed
to a vacuum of 0.1 om Hg for 42 hr at
1375°C. Both samples showed many
subsurface voids; those in Inconel
appeared to be spherical, whereas
those in the 80% Ni-20% Cr alloy were

angular, as shown in Fig. 54. Chemical
analysis of the entire Inconel speci-
men indicated a drop in chromium
content from about the usual 15% to

9.2%.

The mechanism of void formatien in
Inconel is therefore believed: to
occur in two stages. The first
involves a loss of chromium atoms by
diffusion to the metal surface and
then into the fluoride bath. The
resulting large number of vacant
lattice sites 1s reduced to a more
stable number by “precipitation” as
illustrated in Fig. 55. For ease of
illustration only six vacancies are
shown to constitute a void. The
number of vacant atoms involved in
the voids shown in previous photo-
micrographs is of the order of 10%2
atoms.

Tripositive Nickel Compounds from
Hydroxide Corrosion (J. V. Cathcart,
W. H. Bridges, L. D. Dyer, B. Borie,
Metallurgy Division). Two new tri-
positive compounds of nickel have been
identified as corrosion products of
nickel attacked by sodium hydroxide
in the presence of oxygen. The purpose
of this investigation was twofold.
First, in corrosion and mass transfer
studies with the hydroxides, a variety
of black and colored products has been
obtained that do not correspond to
any known nickel compounds. The
occurrence of these products has been
somewhat of a difficulty in the efforts
to ascertain the mechanismof hydroxide
corrosion. It was desired therefore
to try to identify some of the more
unusual corrosion products and de-
termine some of their physical and
chemical properties to aid in future
identification and toc give some clue
as to how they might have been formed.

The second purpose of this in-
vestigation was to determine whether
nickel ions of valence greater than
2 might occur in hydroxide melts.

Solutions of Metals in Molten
Halides (M. A. Bredig, J. WW. Johnson,
H. R. Bronstein, Chemistry Division).
Considerable effort has been directed
toward improving the experimental
technique so that more accurate
determinations can be made of the
solubility of metals in the melts of
their halides. With the improved
technique, which does not appear to
be subject to the previous objections,
a solubility of 2.87 mole % potassium
in the molten ternary eutectic LiF-
NaF-KF at 880°C was obtained. The
discrepancy with the value of 1.6
mole % reported previously, which is
not too serious in view of the ex-
perimental difficulties, is thought
to be due mainly to removal of potassium
metal in the earlier experiments by
leaching the salt phase with alcohol.
The leaching may not, as intended,
have been confined to the dissolution
of metal not dissolved in the melt;
the alcohol may also have attacked the
metal dispersed in the solidified
salt phase. Separation by alcohol
leaching has been abandoned. Satis-
factory separation of molten halide

Among other halide systems, chlorides
are receiving continued attention.
In view of the possibility of chlorine
isotope separation, such Systems may
even be of direct interest for reactor
applications. In the sodium metal-
sodium chloride system, an increasing
solubility of the metal from amounts
of the order of 1 mole % near the
melting point of sodium chloride to
amounts of 20 mole % 200°C above the
melting point was observed. The
disagreement of such comparatively
high solubility with the solubility
predicted by a current theory of
metal-metal halide solutions is being
studied. Possible relationships
between changes in structure and
volume upon melting of the molten
halides and the solubility of metal
in them are being investigated.

Cone-Arc Welding. The feasibility
of the application of the cone-arc
welding process to fabrication of
tube-to-header heat exchangers was
determined by experiment in previous
work. (*) It has been recognized, how-
ever, that the systematic determination
of the behavior of the basic welding
variables associated wath the cone-arc
welding process would contribute toward
a better understanding of possible
applications and limitations. The
effects of arc-current magnitude and
duration on the inside and outside
diameters (D; and D ) of the weld and
on the minimum weld penetration (P)
have been determined, The initial arc
current is generally of the order of
100% greater than the steady-state
value and is the subject of another
study now in progress.

the relatively small increase in weld
penetration P and the equally small
decrease in b,, indicates that the
major portion of additional energy

served to increase the ineffective
weld area. It may be noted,
that cone-arc welds may be. made over a
relatively wide range of conditions,

greater header distortion becomes
evident with higher energy input.

The results of a similar study are

arc time as the variable. The simi-
larity of Figs. 58 and 59 1s evident.
Analysis of the curves in Fig. 59 will

TESTS OF BRAZING ALLOYS

P. Patriarca G. M. Slaughter
Metallurgy Division

The tensile strength and static
corrosion tests of brazed joints are
continuing. (%) The corrosion tests
are being extended to include static
tests of brazed joints in moist air
and tests of nickel joints in hy-
droxides. Brazing efficiencies as
high as 92% for butt-brazed joints
have been demonstrated in tensile
tests, The brazing of molybdenum is
being investigated. An additional
brazing research facility has been
provided by the recent installation of
a large G-E brazing furnace for dry-
hydrogen brazing operations,

Static Corrosion Tests of Brazed
Joints. The static corrosion testing
of brazed joints for the high-tempera-
ture brazing alloy evaluation program
is continuing. The 16.5% Cr-10.0%
Si~2.5% Mn~71.0% Ni alloy developed by
the General Electric Company is attacked
rather severely by the fluoride mix-
ture NaF-KF-LiF-UF, when brazed both
on Inconel and type 316 stainless steel,
Photomicrographs of these corroded
joints are shown in Fig. 60,

The resistance of brazed joints to
oxidation at high temperature is an
important factor, so tests are being
conducted on brazed joints to deter-
mine the amount of deterioration.
Butt-brazed joints of Inconel, type
316 stainless steel, and A nickel have
been prepared by using several of the
brazing alloys being investigated,
Many of these have been tested in an
atmosphere of moist air at 1500°F, but
metallographic examination of these
joints 1s in the preliminary stage,
Effects of oxidation at higher temper-
atures will also be investigated, but
the tests are presently being run to
provide a source for the screening of
the less desirable alloys,

Tensile Strength of Brazed joints.
In order that an approximate tensile
strength of joints butt-brazed with
the 60% Pd-40% Ni alloy could be
obtained, a few preliminary tensile
tests were made on these joints prior
to a more thorough investigation,
pending the arrival of an appropriate
high-temperature extensometer, Standard
tensile bars 0,505 in. in diameter were
machined from butt-brazed type 316

cycles, were also pulled as check
samples on the strength of the parent
metal. The results of these tests are
summarized in Table 30.

The fracture of the butt-brazed
joint at room temperature occurred
along the diffusion zone of the joint.

The fracture of the joint brazed at
1500°F resulted in a more ragged
surface and occurred frequently along
the braze metal-base metal interface.
all these data suggest that
the 60% Pd-40% Ni alloy is very
promising, although it is still ex-
tremely desirable to strive for lower-
ing of the melting point by alloying.

Brazing of Molybdenum. In view of
the interest shown in the fabrication
of molybdenum, it was decided to
conduct a limited program on the
brazing of this metal with the various
high-temperature alloys presently being
investigated. The wettability charac-
teristics of the various brazing alloys
on bright-annealed molybdenum sheet in
a dry-hydrogen atmosphere are listed
in Table 31,

A further indication of the strength
of molybdenum brazed joints should be
obtained from the tensile test speci-
mens to be prepared in future work.
If a small quantity of ductile mo-
lybdenum can be obtained, tensile
tests will be made on this material,
since more reliable data should result,

steel pipe was welded into the sealed
end of the muffle to permit the entry
of dry hydrogen.

A system, Fig, 61, for providing a
dry-hydrogen atmosphere is attached to
this furnace. Included in this system
is a nitrogen cylinder (to purge the
hydrogen lines of air), a Deoxo
Duridryer,¢%) and a Lectrodryer
dehumidifier.¢’? The dryer converts
oxygen to water and the dehumidifier
removes the water. Dew points of
~120°F can be obtained, although -60°F

is satisfactory for most applications.

When the need arises for the furnace
brazing of assemblies larger than the
stainless steel muffle permits, it is
convenient to use canning techniques.
Such techniques consist of enclosing
the assembly in a stainless steel can,
which 1s then welded shut. Stainless
steel entrance and exit tubes are
provided in the can for the hydrogen

flow. With the controlled atmosphere
located entirely in the stainless can,
any furnace of proper size and temper-
ature limits can be used as the source
of heat. The sodium-to-air heat ex-
changer, Fig. 62 {approximate di-
mensions, 12 by 6 by 8 in.) is typical
of the assemblies that can be brazed by
this canning technique.

Nicrobraz powder was placed on all
of the joints, including approximately
2500 tube-to-baffle plate joints.
Good hydrogen flow over the entire
assembly was needed for proper flow of
the brazing alloy, and it is expected
that a series of baffle plates inside
the can will be required to attain
this flow for brazing of similar, but

larger, heat exchanger units.

calculations show that flowing hydrogen
should be capable of reducing molybdenum
disulfide at temperatures in the
neighborhood of 1000°C, Solid zinc is
thermodynamically capable of reducing
molybdenum disulfide and would probably
work as well as molten zinc,

The reduction of molybdenum di-
sulfide by hydrogen would be ac-
complished by the following reaction:

where p is the equilibrium pressure
and K 1s the appropriate equilibrium
constant, as implicitly defined by the
above equation. Values of K are given
by Kelley. (®)

For a hydrogen pressure of 760 mm
the equilibrium pressure of H,S at
910°C is 6.65 mm, and at 1100°C it is
14.5 mm, These are quite appreciable
pressures, and it should be easy to
reduce molybdenum disulfide at these
temperatures 1f the reaction rate is
at all reasonable. Tt would be neces-
sary to remove H,S from the reacting
mixture, but this could be accomplished
with a current of hydrogen.

The reduction of molybdenum di-
sulfide by zinc can be represented by
the following equation: :

MoS, + 2Zn —> Mo + 2ZnS .

The standard free energy change for
this reaction in the case of solid
zinc may be obtained from the data

AF° = 28,340 ~ 2.567 log T + 2.40 x 10737?

+ 2.198 x 107577 + 9,127

Thus at 25°C, AF° = ~26.6 kcal/g-aton
of MoS,. The standard free energy
equation does not exist, and calcu-
lations of AF° at elevated temperatures
would quantitatively be somewhat
deceiving. However, the reduction is
thermodynamically possible at 25°C,
and the AF° is sufficiently sub-
stantial to warrant consideration of
this method of reduction at elevated
temperatures.

work was carried out on the application
of a ceramic coating to nickel to
provide oxidation resistance at
elevated temperatures. Successful
application of such a coating would
make it possible to use nickel in a

annealing specimens of pyrometallurgi-
cal nickel, 10 mils thick, in an
atmosphere of wet hydrogen for 65 hr
at 1000°C, good adherence was obtained
with National Bureau of Standards

composition of this coating has been
described in a previous report, (19)
Specimens coated with the A-418 com-

To satisfy the
for an efficient and
material for use as a
reflector-moderator for a liquid-cycle
aircraft reactor, a glass-bonded
beryllium oxide material has been
proposed. This material would have

143
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

nearly zero porosity and would contain
a minimum of 75 mole % beryllium oxide.
The glass forming the bond would also
contain a small amount of beryllium
oxide, consistent with viscosity re-
quirements for fabrication. Simulated
mixes using soda-lime-silica glass and
silica sand were prepared on a small
scale, and it was determined that such
a material could be made successfully.
The density of a selected, glass-bonded
beryllium oxide, reflector-wmoderator
material was determined as 2.6 g/cc.
It is proposed that the reflector be
cooled by metal pipes embedded in the

glass~bonded beryllium oxide. The
pipes would contain flowing sodium as
a coolant, and once the glass-bonded
beryllium oxide had been ponred into
the shell and had flowed around the
cooling pipes, the reactor shell would
not he allowed to cool below a temper-
ature just above the annealing range
of the glass bond. Further refinements
and engineering tests will be made,
should this material be of interest.
Among these would be the determination
of the devitrification tendency of the
glassy matrix and the corrosion effect
of the glass with selected metals.

vacuum pump, which establishes a
pressure differential between the
outside and inside liquid surfaces.
The pressure difference is automati-
cally stabilized at predetermined

levels through a circuit that ‘has
leads into a mercury manometer, The
liquid travels upward through the
calibrated tube and reaches a wider

tube in which three electrically in-
sulated metal probes are immersed.
The time elapsed between reaching a
lower and a higher level 1s measured
with an electric timer connected to
these leads. Upon completion of the
time measurement, a relay closes the
valve to the vacuum pump and opens a
valve to compressed argon, the pressure
of which can also be regulated. The
liquid is then forced back to 1ts
original position and the apparatus
is ready for another measurement. The
temperature is regulated and recorded
during the experiment with a Micromax
recorder. A 5-gal container is used
to reduce the pressure fluctuations of
the vacuum pump. During the whole
operation the surface of the melt is
protected with a blanket of argon from
contamination by the air,

Preliminary trials with the apparatus
have indicated satisfactory performance.
Calibration studies utilizing a number
of fused salts are now 1n progress.

BOILING HEAT TRANSFER IN MERCURY

Further measurements have been
obtained on free-convection boiling of
mercury from horizontal surfaces. The
experimental heat transfer vs. temper-
ature difference data are presented in
Fig. 66, From this plot the mean heat
transfer coefficients shown in Fig. 67
were computed. The increase 1in
pressure accompanying a change in
boiling temperature from 350 to 550°F
produced an approximately threefold
increase in the heat transfer co-
efficient for any givem heat flux
level. On the basis of these results,
boiling and condensing mercury should
prove to be a good medium for heat
transfer in high-temperature power
cycles, A large difference between
the heat transfer coefficient data for
the mercury-copper {wetted} and
mercury-chromium {(nonwetted) systems
may be observed. There are insufficient
data at this tiwe to establish accu-
rately the specific interface-fluid
temperature difference at which boiling
is initiated, as well as other boiling
curve characteristics, However, it
does appear that the boiling co-
efficients rise rapidly at the higher
temperature increments, as in the case
of boiling water.

cooling systems for the upper electrode

for leaks, and the system will be
ready to operate when the flat-plate
data have been obtained. This apparatus
was designed to operate in the high-
laminar and low-turbulent flow regions.
The upper limit is set by the 10-kw
maximum power now available. The
validity of all previous data was in
question because it was not possible
to directly measure the wall tempera-
ture. Since the temperature gradient
is maximum at the wall, it is diffi-
cult to determine the wall temperature
from “near-the-wall” measurements.

Mean circulation velocities should
be known in order to properly interpret
corrosion results in thermal convection
loops. At present, ANP convection
harps are instrumented so that approxi-
mate wall-temperature distributions of
the cold legs and power inputs to
electrical heaters on the hot legs are
measured, This information can be
used to estimate some maximum and
minimum circulating velocities that

it is necessary to solve the combined
heat and momentum transfer problem
numerically. Sowe incomplete numerical
analyses indicate that the calculated
circulation velocities fall within the
estimated range close to the minimum
value, Thus 1t appears that the
circulating velocities in the con-
vection harps are approximately 0,1
ft/sec when the fluid is NaF-KF-LiF
(11.5-42.0-46.5 mole %). Tt should be
possible to 1ncrease these velocities
by heating the hot legs and cooling
the cold legs in such a way that uni-

exist in those legs.

experiments have been carried out on
the effects of irradiation on the
fused fluoride fuels, the performance
of liquid metal loops, the creep of
metals, and the thermal conductivity
of metals.

152

As in the case of the beryllium-
bearing fuels previously reported, the
evidence to date indicates that there
is no significant radiation-induced
corrosion with zirconium-bearing fuels
undergoing fission at the rates
that will occur during operation of
the ARE. Apparatus is currently being
assembled and inserted in the MTR to
provide an exposure facility for the
FOR

fused fluoride fuels in which fission
rates comparable to those that would
occur in an aircraft reactor can be
achieved. Measurements made in the
graphite reactor on the escape of
Xel3S froma capsule of molten fluoride
fuel showed that only a small fraction
of the xenon diffused out of the
liquid.

Examination of an Inconel loop
through which sodium had been circu-
lated at a peak temperature of 1500°F
in the graphite reactor disclosed no
positive evidence of radiation-induced
corrosion,

In-reactor cantilever creep measure-
ments were made on Inconel specimens
subjected to the 1700°F anneal proposed
for the ARE fuel tubes. Under some
conditions of stress and flux there
was no increase in the creep rate due
to the irradiation, such as was
previously reported for specimens
annealed at lower temperatures. It
was also found that the thermal con-
ductivity of Inconel given the ABRE-
specified heat treatment was un-
affected by irradiation in the LITR.

Additional details on radiation
damage studies are contained in the
quarterly reports of the Solid State

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1952

(4.8-50,1-41,3-3.8 mole %), were
irradiated at 1500°F for 140 hr in
Inconel capsules in the LITR. Energy
was dissipated in the fuel at a rate
of 125 watts per cubic centimeter of
fuel, which is in the range of the
peak power dissipation expected during
operation of the ARE. As with the
beryllium-bearing fuels previously
irradiated, chemical analyses of the
zirconium-bearing fuels and metal-
lographic examinations of the capsules
showed no evidence of radiation-
induced corrosion when compared with
two out-of-reactor control runs.

Bombardment of zirconium-bearing
fuel in an Inconel capsule for 8 hr in
the cyclotron with a beam of 22.5-Mev
protons dissipating ‘2500 watts per
cubic centimeter of fuel caused a
slight increase in the corrosion of
the Inconel. This is similar to the
result reported previously for a
lithium-bearing fuel. (1)

An experiment was performed to
determine the rate of diffusion of
Xel35 from the fused fluoride fuels
under essentially stagnant or
turbulent conditions, Two runs were
made in the ORNL graphite reactor at
1300°F with NaF-BeF,-UF, (25-60-5
mole %) fuel containing natural uranium
in Inconel capsules. In the first run
xenon was flushed out by bubbling
helium through the melt, whereas in
the other the gas was simply swept
over the surface. The xenon removed

1700°F are shown in the two lower
curves in Fig. 69; the upper four
curves, reported previously, (®) are

shown for comparison. Although the
difference in behavior is attributed
to the heat treatment, there was a
difference in the manner of annealing
that could have been partly responsible.
The 1650°F anneals were carried out
in sttu and only the gage length was
exposed to the desired temperature, so
some long-time metallurgical changes
in and beyond the fillets could have
occurred. During the 1700°F anneals
the full length of the specimen was
heated in a large furnace.

cal grain growth,
causing the increased creep rate

unlikely in Inconel. The sluggishness
of the recrystallization process in
Inconel when only small amounts of
cold reduction have preceded the
anneal is well known. Although the
metallurgical history of the plate
from which these specimens were made
is unknown, hardness measurements
indicate that it received about a 5%
cold reduction following the penultimate
anneal. Evidence of structural changes

SUMMARY AND

The analytical chemistry program
in support of the materials research
and equipment development programs
included the routine analysis of 1179
individual samples, as well as the
development of new analytical procedures
(sec. 14). In particular, new methods
have been developed for the quantitative
determination of the constituents and

INTRODUCTION
current work is concerned with the
improvement and simplification of
these analytical techniques.

The list of reports that have been
issued by the project during the last
quarter includes 17 formal reports and
56 informal documents (not including
internal documents) on all phases of

 

impurities in fluoride fuels. The ANP research at OBNL (sec. 15).

Progress has been made in improving of water in finely divided solid

and simplifying the methods of analyses
of reactor fuels. A volumetric method
has been developed for the determination
of alkali metals that depends upon
separation of the elements by ion
exchange and their indirect determi-
nation by titration of an equivalent
quantity of chloride ion. The in-
vestigation of a volumetric method for
the determination of zirconium in
fuels has continued. Zirconium 1in
fuels canbe determined by a volumetric
method, in the absence of uranium,
with an accuracy of about 1%. It
appears that this determination can
also be performed in the presence of
uranium, and this phase of the problem
is still being investigated. The use
of silver peroxide as an oxidant in
the determination of chromium by
means of diphenylcarbazide has been
studied, and anew and improved method,
based on this study, has been adapted
for the determination of chromium.
Attempts to determine nickel in reactor
fuels by means of nitroso salicylic
acid were not successful.

A method similar to the Dean and
Stark method¢!) has been developed
for the determination of trace amounts

materials, This method is particularly
valuable for use with some fluorides
with which other methods fail. The
products of the reaction between Nak
and reactor fuels have been studied.
It was found that uranium(IV) is
reduced to UF,, and at least one other
constituent of the fuel, which

be zirconium{IV), 1s also reduced.

problem of the determination of alkali

metals and has reduced the need for
methods of separation of alkali metals
from each other. An indirect method
was, however, developed for the
separation and determination of sodium
and potassium that involved the
titration of the chloride equivalent
tothe alkali metal ion. The separation
1s accomplished by means of ioun-=-
exchange resins. Although the sepa-
ration is time-consuming, by using
several columns the time for each
determination 1s far less than is
required by the conventional techniques
for this separation.

Zirconium. A volumetric method for
the determination of zirconium that
makes use of the fluoride complex was
suggested by Sawaya and Yamashita.(2)
In essence, the procedure used in this
study 1s to precipitate zirconium
hydroxide by the addition of sodium
hydroxide, adjust the pH of the slurry
to 8.5, add a 15- to 20-fold excess
of potassium fluoride, neutralize the
potassium hydroxide formed with excess
standard nitric acid solution, and
titrate the excess acid to a pH of 7.5
with standard sodium hydroxide so-
lution. The reactions involved are
not stoichiometric, and as a result
the method must be standardized
empirically.

Data gathered thus far have shown
that by standardization against a
known quantity of zirconium 1t is
possible to titrate the element with
an error of less than 1%, the
conditions described, for a range of
zirconium concentration of 15 to 60 mg
in a volume of 200 ml. The error for
larger amounts has not been determined
with any degree of certainty, as yet.

The additionof uranium to zirconium

sulfate solutions results in some

interference, since uranium forms a
slightly soluble hydrous oxide.

Compensation for this interference was
made on the basis that 2.22 moles of
sodium hydroxide(3) is consumed to
precipitate each mole of uranium.
The results on samples containing
3, 6, and 12 mg of uranium per 60 mg
of zirconium agreed within 1% after
the application of the necessary
correction factor for uranium. The
application of this method to sulfate
solutions of reactor fuels showed that
the results for zirconium by the
volumetric procedure (with uranium
correction) were generally 3 to 5%
higher than those obtained gravimetri-
cally by the phenylarsonic acid
precipitation method. The study of
the application of this method 1s
continuing,

ANALYTICAL STUDIES OF IMPURITIES
IN FLUORIDE MIXTURES

Chromium, The use of silver
peroxide¢*) as an oxidant for chromi-
um(IITI) in the colorimetric determi-
nation of chromium by diphenylcarbazide
has been investigated, and a procedure
in which silver nitrate and potassium
persulfate solutions are employed in
the oxidation step was adapted for the
determination of chromium in reactor
fuels. The precision of the method
is equal to that obtained when any
other oxidant is used, and the method
is probably the most rapid of any
currently in use. An additional
feature is that the chromium(VI)
formed is stable for at least 24 hr
after oxidation, which 1s not true in
the case of a number of the other
oxidants commonly employed in this
determination. This work 1s described
elsewhere(5) in greater detail.

FOR

Nickel. The commonly used di-
methylglyoxime method, with certain
modifications in procedure to adapt
it to use with fluoride fuels, 1s
employed for the determination of
nickel. Because the quantity of
nickel appearing as a corrosion
product in the fuels currently being
tested is generally smaller than has
been the case in the past, the lower
limit of determination of nickel has
become more critical. A practical
limitation is imposed on the sample
size used because of the presence of
zirconium and the high acid concen-
tration necessary to prevent its
hydrolysis. The lower limit of de-
termination of the present method is
10 ppm, and the use of absorption
cells of 5~cm path length is necessary
to achieve this figure.

A brief investigation was made of a
method for the determination of nickel
that involves extraction of nickel at
a pH of 5 to 6 with nitroso salicylic
acid.(%) The obvious advantage of
this method is that the color can be
developed in slightly acidic solution
instead of the strongly basic
lution requiredin the dimethylglyoxime
procedure. Unfortunately, the zirconium
concentration is so high that the
large quantity of complexing agent
(oxalate, tartrate, or fluoride)
retards the formation of the colored
complex. It appears that the use of
5-cm absorption cells will be necessary
in most cases to obtain satisfactory
absorbancy measurements for nickel in
the range of less than 50 ppm.

50 ~

Oxygen, The determination of
oxygen in reactor fuels is a problem
of considerable importance, since the
presence of oxygen 1s generally con-
sidered to be a contributing facter
in the corrosionof container materials,

with the liberation of oxygen, with
virtually all the oxides that can

possibly be present in these reactor
fuels (U0,, Zr0,, Fe, 04, Cr,0;, NiO),
and 1t 1s believed that this reaction
can be made to serve as a basis for a
determination of oxygen.

An apparatus in which BrF, will be
reacted with the fuel at elevated
temperatures of the order of 325°C
is being fabricated at the present
time. The reaction bomb and the high-
pressure system are constructed of
nickel. The oxygen liberated from the
reaction will be determined by a
simple gasometric measurement of the
oxygen pressure in an evacuated system
at a reduced temperature. This method
appears favorable because of 1ts
simplicity and the relatively short
time required for each determination.
A pyrex unit to perform this operation
has been fabricated and leak-tested,
If unexpected difficulties arise,
however, other methods for the de-
termination of the oxygen evolved in
the reaction are available.

Chloride. The zirconium tetra-
fluoride used in the preparation of
reactor fuels 1s prepared by the
hydrofluorination of zirconium tetra-
chloride. Since chlorine 1s an
undesirable impurity in fuels because
of its rather high neutron-capture
cross section, it 1s necessary to
determine chloride in zirconium
tetrafluoride to assure that its
concentration 1s below tolerable
limits.

Several attacks were made on this
problem. A semiguantitative test
was devised in which a turbidimetric
comparison was made between a hydro-
fluoric acid, silver nitrate solution
of the unknown sample of zirconium
tetrafluoride, and standard quantities
of chloride in similar solutions, As
little as 0.01% of chloride imparted
an easily visible cloudiness to the

161
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

solution. Jt is significant that none
of the samples of tetra-
fluoride tested so far have produced
a visible cloudiness, which indicates
a chloride content less than 0.01%
for these samples.

zirconium

A second method of attack was to
oxidize the chloride present to
chlorine and determine it iodometri-
cally. By using a sample of suitable
size, 1t was possible to determine as
little as 0.05% chlorine. Potassium
permanganate, ceric sulfate, and lead
dioxide were tested as oxidants,
Permangante 1s generally unsatis-
factory; it yields results averaging
20% high. This is believed to be
caused principally by decomposition of
permanganic acid during refluxing,
Ceric sulfate gave low results in
most cases, as did lead dioxide, which
was only briefly tested.

The semiquantitative test yields
results of sufficient accuracy for
the present purposes.

Water. A method for the determi-
nation ol trace amounts of water in
fluorides, oxides, and other solids
in a finely divided state has been
developed. Such a method was princi-
pally required for the analysis of
the mixture to be used for cold
critical experiments and its components,
Water is extracted from the solids by
refluxing with xylene by an adaptation
of the Dean-Stark method.(!) The
xylene-water azerotrope is distilled
into methyl alcohol and the water is
titrated with Karl Fischer reagent.
This method was adopted in preference
to the direct titration of the solid
with Karl Fischer reagent partly
because of sample size limitations
and partly because investigation
showed that the completeness of the
reaction was

determination of water were unsuccessful

salts that takes place at elevated
temperatures.

The extraction method has proved
to be completely satisfactory. Samples
of the order of 20 g can be handled,
if necessary. The blank, although
accounting for 50 to 75% of the total
titration in some samples, has been
reproducible to within less than 1%.
The method has been tested against
standard sodium tartrate, with the
recovery of water averaging nearly
90%. In addition to NaF, Zr0O,, C,
UF,, and KF, the method has been used
successfully on fluerides such as

NH,F, NH,HF,, NiF,, KHF,, and K,FeF.

DETERMINATION OF CARBON IN ZrF, AND
Zr0,-NaF-C MIXTURES

In determining carbon in zirconium
fluoride and in ZrO,-NaF-.C mixtures
by combustion, the fluorides interfere.
This difficulty has been overcome
by removing the fluorides by dis-
solution. Zirconium fluoride is
dissolved by oxalic acid and the
alkali fluorides by warm water. The
residue is collected 1n a small,
guartz, filtering crucible and the
carbon determined by
combustion. Since large samples may
be used, the accuracy of the carbon
determination is 1ncreased.

products of reactor fuels (NaF-ZrF, -

conditions. The conclusions drawn
from the chemical analyses were:
(1) NaK reduces U(IV) to UF,, which
separates from the molten mass and
settles to the bottom of the container;
(2) the greater the concentration of
NaK, the more complete the reduction;
(3) a nearly linear relationship
exists between the hydrogen evolved
from the fuel upon acidification and
the amount of NaK added to the fuel;
(4) NaK, in large excess over that
required to reduce quantitatively the
UF, to UF,, reduces other components
of the fuel, which form compounds that
also evolve hydrogen from acidic
solutions; (5) less than 50% of the
reducing power of the NaK added was
recovered in any test.
