MAINTENANCE OF VARIOUS REACTOR TYPES

UNCLASSIFIED
I. INTRODUCTION ;

: It has been a common practice in the past to investigate maintenance tech-

niques and related equipment efter many reactor features were esteblished. This

is especially true of some of the experimental end research reactors; the operation
and maintenance of which unfortunately comprise most of our actual knowledge in
this field. These reactors did not have as thelr objective the demonstration of
maintenance feasibility. With this in mind, it can be seen that many proposed
power reactor maintenance concepts are Just what the name implies; ideas, that
may or may not be practical until tried out under at least simulated reactor
operating conditions.

In the sbsence of predecessors in most cases vpon which plant layout and
design may be based, it has been necessary to establish certain rules in order
that these processes may proceed while further development work is done on compon-
ents and concepts. There are certain basic maintenance fundamentels that are common
to ell types of reactors that may be incorporated in a power producing facility.
The various components of en ideal system should be grouped and related in such
a manner that the maintenance of the equipment is readily accomplished. In
eddition, the system should be convenient for operation and require & minimum of
manpower and capital outlay to achieve the desired objectives. It can be seen then
the necessity of making an early study of maintenance procedures in order that the
resulting design will produce a program integrated and balanced with other features

of the plant. For this reason, & primary plant maintenance philosophy should be

developed at the beginning of the layout work.

II. TYPES OF MAINTENANCE ) |

Besically, there are only two types of maintenance procedures. The direct
type, which 1s common to conventional steam plents,. ney be used in some ereas |
where the radioactivity level is low enough. In most parts of the plant, main-
tenance will of necessity be remote due to the high level of radicactivity.

UNGLASS FED

Remote maintenance may be further subdivided into "wet" or "dry."

In the "wet" remote type of maintenance, after the equipment is shut down and
© dreined, the area is flooded, the roof removed end maintenance is done by tools
with long extension handles looking down through 15 or 20 feet of water. However,
a disadvantage ie that where e piping system must be opened during maintenance
operations there is always the possibility that the shielding water can enter and
contaminate the system.

With "dry" remote maintenance, after the equipment is shut down and drained,
‘manipulators mounted on cranes or remote tools operated from behind mobile iead
shields are used. However, the present development of remote dry maintenance has
been very limited. In the past, decontamination and direct maintenance have been
- relied upon to permit repair of equipment, but in e 500 mw hémogeneous plant,

hid for example, radistion levels of 106 roentgen can be expected in some areas, thus

> the inaccessibility for direct maintenance.

, III. APPLICATION
For simplicity of description in this report, all reactor types are divided
into two general classes; i.e., solid fuel types and circulating fuel types. It
shall be our purpose to examine the various reactor types in each classification
‘for progress, feasibility and problems still faced by the deslen in question.
‘A. Solid Fuel Types }
© } In general, it may be said that solid fuel type reactors are easier to
maintain than etreulating fuel types. This 1s due, of course, to the retention
of the fission fragments and poisons within the cladding of the fuel elements.
= However, some solid fuel reactors are more atfricult to maintain than others.
+ Examples are the boiling water reactors vhich due to steam ectivation and the
presence of activeted impurities and radicactive non-condensibles (xo and AM

in the coolant make maintenance of the primary loop impossible during operation,

and the sodium cooled reactors which contain highly active Na™ upon irradiation
of the coolant.
1. Sas-Cooled Reactors
An integral part of maintenance on 50Lid-fuel reactors is fuel

handling associated with charging and discharging the unit at periodic intervals.

This fuel handling equipment must be highly relieble since failure of certain

components may be very costly. Handling equipment 1s subjected to severe environ-
mentel conditions. In addition, the equipment must be resistent to radiation
attack.

~ With the exception of the Savannsh River Reactor, most experience
has been gained on charging reactors having horizontal channels for fuel elements.
At Calder Hall the chamnels are vertical and blind st the bottom, thus charging

and discharging must be accomplished from the top. Two mobile charging machines

and two discharging machines are provided for each reactor. The machines are

electrically propelled end cerry & winch and an electrically operated grab for

raising end lowering the fuel elements. When the magazine of the discharge machine

is loaded with spent fuel elements, it moves to & circular well through which the

magezine is lowered to ground level and deposited in & shielded flask for trans-

portation to the storage pond. The time required for the charge end discharge of

one group of 4 channels is sbout 1 1/k hours. There are six fuel elements per

channel and & total of 1696 channels to give some idea of the work involved.

. At an early stage of the Calder Hall design, it was decided that
time did not permit the development of & system that would permit charging and
discharging the reactor while running at full power, thus the operation is performed
et shutdown end with the unit depressurized.

A hazard that must be guarded against in the operation of a solid
fuel type reactor is the possibility of a fuel element failure which would release

fission products into the coolant ‘system and create radiation hazards in the portion

of the plant occupied by operating personnel. IED, would, of course, add con-
siderable complications in the maintenance of components in the coolant circuit.
At Calder Hall each of the 1696 fuel channels is provided with a stainless steel
tube which bleeds off a small portion of the gas. passing through the channel and
carries it to monitoring devices which detect the presence of the released fission
products. For the first 8 months of operation, only 2 slug failures have occurred
which is mich lower than predicted.

Thus the complete systen of burst slug detection and fuel replace-
ment,if somewhat cumbersome and laborious, is also quite reliable which was the
desifed goal. -

An important feature of gas-cooled reactors from both design and
me obenance standpoints is the freedom to use mild carbon steels throughout the
pone, 1 heat exchanger and ductwork systems. This results from the use of clean, |
non-corrosive gas coolant. |

For the proposed gas-cooled stations to be built in Great Britein,

the most significant advance in new designs is the introduction of fuel changing

‘under load. It has been postulated that this ability to charge and discharge

fuel elements under full load end without eny interruption to the operation of the
plant may prove to be one of the most important factors in establishing the
superiority of the gas-cooled reactor over other designs. At present, one of the
most serious objections to the designs of liquid cooled reactors is the need to

shut down in order to change fuel elements. This is due to the nigh operating

} pressure of Liquid cooled reactors.

Three of the four new designs utilize, 8 conventional top loading,
novever, 1t 1s proposed by the GEC-Simon Carves group to load the Hunterston
plant (ea 300 mr electric station) from the bottom of the reactor. This design
coupled with charging and discharging under full loed conditions represents quite

an advance over the Calder Ball Gesign..

re

In generel, maintenance of a gas-cooled reactor plant is feasible
since the radiation is kept below tolerance levels throughout most of the plant,
and the burst-slug detection equipment should enable removal of a defective
element before any serious contamination occurs. With the new designs, the gas-
cooled reactors ere placed in an even more favorable light as far as maintenance
is concerned.

2. : Organic Reactors

Orgenic cooled and moderated reactors offer several advantages as
far as power reactors are concerned. First, the lack of activation of the coolant
in conjunction with a good purification system could eliminate all secondary
shielding. Second, the low vapor pressure of organics which are being considered
for the coolant and moderator results in reduced thickness of pressure vessel and
piping wall. Third, the relatively low corrosiveness and good lubricating
properties of diphenyl have been confirmed and this considerably simplifies the
material problems by eliminating the customarily required stainless steels(d),

~~ One important uncertainty in this system is the rate at which the
organic would have to be replaced as & result of thermal and radiation damage. In
any event, the stebility limitations of the most radiation stable organic materials
are such that a purification system must bé a part of any reactor design. This
damage of the organic is noted because of the possibility of deposition on heat
transfer surfaces of the products of decomposition. However, tests by the
Californie Research Corporationt?) indicate that no appreciable deposition occurs
until a point of. considerable decomposition is reached. The purification system
should prevent thie occurrence. |

Maintenance-wise this reactor concept is promising. Centrifugal
pumps with shaft seals can be used since the coolant is non-radioactive and leakage
is not a problem. This of course permits the use of conventional style pumps with
their greater. background of operational end maintenance experience. The use of

commercially available carbon steel pipe will result in initisl savings on fabri-

cation plus easier maintenance after the plant is in operation.

A plate-fin type heat exchanger has been proposed for application
in an organic reactor. The Tow pressure on both primary and secondary sides of
the reactor nse this. feasible. Advantages claimed for this type of unit are im-
proved heat transfer, lower fabrication costs as a result of eliminating large

pressure shells, and trouble-free operation. since all critical welds , those which

“would allow fluid to escape, are on the outside and readily accessible for repair.

The significantly lower weight of the plate-fin type heat exchanger should result
in easier replacement of units should a gross failure occur.

A disadvantage of an organic moderated and cooled reactor system is
the need for a heating system to preheat the loop. However, the melting point of
diphenyl is 156°F which is considerably lower than the melting point of sodium
and some of the fused salts used in other reactor types, end therefore should
present problems of no greater wo gat tude than are faced by these ‘types.

Only limited data is available costwise on operation and maintenance
of an orgsnic moderated reactor. For a 12.5 mr plant, operation and maintenance
have been estimated to be 2.7 mills/kwh. |

| In summary, an organic reactor plant should be one of the easier
types to maintain for the following reasons: accessibility to components since
extensive shielding is not required; use of conventional pumps; use of low pressure
carbon steel piping and components; and the possible application of conventional
maintenance procedures to a large part of the plant. |

Be | Pressurized Water Reactors

| A typical layout for a pressurized water reactor consists of a |
reactor and a number of circulating coolant loops. The PWR, for example, has four
coolant loops each located in a shielded compartment 3 ), The shielding is

designed to provide radiation protection, from adjacent loops and the reactor cell,

to personnel who mey be inside the compartment engaged in maintenance work. All

UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

of the loop equipment is located within the shield except the hydraulic inlet and.

~ outlet stop v valves.

The installstion of hydraulic end manual stop velves in each inlet
and outlet pipe provides double protection for personnel performing maintenance
work on a depressurized and deconteminated ‘coolant loop. In addition, drain
lines ere provided between each set of double stop velves to revel eny leak through
the first velve. | |

Any loop may be arétned separately into the discharge system.

Afver drainage is camplete ) 1% can be deconteminated by means of a chemical wash
1ine. Once & loop hes been drained and decontaminated, repair personnel can enter
the Loop catpartment and isolate the loop ‘by means of the manual stop valves.
Thus direct msintenance 1s possible on & lerge portion of the circulating coolant
loops. Accessibility to the core may “be provided by & water shield over the pressure
vessel, vhich is drained during operation. AL ork done in the reactor compartment
mst be done ‘remotely, working through the water ghield.

The refueling of the reactor will be eccanplished by & fuel handling
crane, which is equipped vith impact wrenches, extraction tool , and transfer end

handling devices. A problem faced in refueling all solid fuel type reactors is

methods of heat removal from the core during shutdown. To remove the reactor heat

during an unloading operation, a separate etreutt is usually provided. In thie
system prinary water is pumped through en external heat exchanger ‘thus removing
heat from the core of the reactor. In eddition, when fuel elements are removed,
uneven coolent flow may result in the creation of hot spots in some areas of the
core. Further study is necessary to determine the feasibility of plugging these
leskage pith during refueling). This problem of cooling the core vould be of
even greater magnitude should the coolant circulating pumps fell during operation.
The costs for operation end maintenance of a pressurized water reactor
power plant 4 in the range of 150 mv to 200my have been estimated at 1 ni11/kvh

(5,6).

UNCLLSSIFED 2

~The feasibility of maintenance on & reactor of this design has
been demonstrated a submarine reactor program and will be further exhibited
when the Shippingport plant of the Duguesne Power and Light Company goes on the
line. |

I, Boiling Water Reactors

| ) A boiling water reactor presents problems from & maintenance point
of view due to steam sctivation and the presence of activated impurites in the
coolant. The reactor vessel end supporting core structure will contain various
emounts of induced activity asa result of direct neutron irradiation. Hence,
the radtation levels cannot be Lowered by decontamination processes. Structurel
failures inside the reactor vessel ‘could possibly be repaired by removel of fuel
elements and flooding the vessel. Tools equipped with extension hendles would

enable the repairs to be made. If the reactor should fail, it would probably

have to be removed and replaced with a new one. The problem of removing the vessel

and subsequently storing or safely disposing of it has never been satisfactorily
solved in any known reactor design. Apparently it is pleaned to solve this problen
vhen it occurs. |

| The equipment associated with the primary loop becomes highly

activated during operation, but should be’ accessible e short time after shutdown.

This is due to ‘the quick decay of the eotivated steam. If activated impurities

deposit in the circulating loops during long periods of operation, decontamination

‘by chemical vashing would be required. This is true of the steam separation drums

which should impose bout the same general mechanical problems as are encountered

in large capacity steam boilers » limited only by the presence of the redioactive

materials adhering to the ‘internal surfaces of the drums or lodged in the steam

separator elements. The use of remote tools is not planned for these units(7 ).
Valves ‘Which ere essociated with the steam end also the feedwater systems should
impose about the same maintenance problems as are faced in any large capactty

steam plent; again, limited by the residual redicactivity deposited ¢ on exposed
surfaces,

Since the steam to the turbine is radioactive and more corrosive

 

than. ordinary due to the carryover of oxygen relessed by: disassociation of the
water, . the turbine must be designed to be especially leak tight as well as unusually
corrosion resistant. Due to the severe oxygen generation by rediation in the
EBWR, ebout 25 ppm in the water, the carbon steel steem pipes and turbines have
.been nickel plated since start-up. The radiation levels near the turbine complicates
teu of preventive maintenance procedures s & fact which further decreases the
probability ‘of long ‘periods of trouble free operation. Thus ‘the requirements of
high integrity end eauplication of design edd considerably to the cost of plant
construction end maintenance.

When the turbine or condenser require matntenance they are decon-
teminated by £1111ng with hot water, vhich is circukted et e slow rate for a
number of hours while the ‘turbine is rolled by the turning gear. After several
citric acid washes, a final water wash is made after which the turbine and ¢ con-
denser may be inspected. The time required for decontamination could’ ‘extend to
several days should the activity remain ebove tolerance levels. This undesirable .
deley time 16 ‘common to all decontenination processes end hence eny reactor design
that tends to spread activity throughout’ the. eysten is inviting longer plant
outages. end higher maintenance costs,

One advantage of the botling water reactor plent from a ‘main-
tenance - standpoint is that’ since the operating pressure is lower than the 2000
; psi pressurized water reactor, the préssure vessel and primary loop components
‘are easier to fabricate. Procurement of’ canponents is also easier since they more
| closely epproach stock items. oo |

| In sumary, it may be said that 8 boiling water reactor presents

more maintenance ‘problems than gas cooled or pressurized vater: reactors due to
increased activity levels throughout the circulating Loop and the difficulty of
access to components as & result of increased shielding requirements. However,

early operation of the EBWR indicates that rediocactive steam is less of a problem .

than feared «- the activity level of the steam leaving + the reactor being on the
order of 5000 times less than the activity of the water in the core(8) . This,
of course, ‘benefits the maintenance program. a
5. Sodium Graphite Resctors
| Sodium graphite reactors are not strictly speaking comparable to the

solid fuel reactors that have been described previcusly. “The difference is that

. when sodium is used as & coolant An a ‘heterogeneous reactor, it becomes highly

radioactive due ‘to the formation of Fat as 8 result of neutron capture. This

some activity remains after flushing, it probably will be necessary to wait until
the et decays to tolerance levels,

A feature of 1iquid metal coolant reactors is that pump maintenance
should be simplified. The electro-magnetic pump, having no moving parts; should
require less maintenance then conventional pumps and this is important because
the pumps may be contaminated with radicective paterials. Since oxygen free liquid
sodium does not attack stainless steels at temperatures below 1110 degree F,
failures of loop components due to metal attack should be reduced. However, the
temperature of the fuel elements of the Sodium Reactor Experiment run as high
as 1200 degrees F, and it is Loped that the mass transfer occurring in steel at

“this temperature can be controlled by certain additives. The sodium temperature
: leaving the core however, is only 960 degree F.

Fuel hendling end charging present problems similer to those faced
by other reactor designs using solid fuel elements. The basic need is to find
materials, cladding especially, that are suitable for use in molten sodium.

Estimates of general operation end maintenance costs for a 160 mw,
electrical, sodium graphite reactor plant range in the area of 1 mil/kwh, which is
in line with other solid fuel reactor designs.

One factor which might cause an upward trend in this figure is the
problem of heating the system. Sodium hes a melting point of 208 degrees F end
therefore it is necessary to first raise the temperature of the system from ambient
to at least 208 degrees F in order to allow £111ing end circulating of the sodium.
This can ve dons with immersion heaters (only if the system is full), clem shell
pipe nesters, ’ resistance heater vrepping or 60 cycle induction heating. The latter
ie being advocated for the EBR-II because of ite promise of greater reliability.

Induction heating of 8 non-ferritie stainless steel system requires
the installation of a carbon steel shell around all the piping and components.
his shell plus the insulation and the copper wire wrapped around the outside to
provide the heating presents severesl barriers to cross if maintenance is required

on the system. Maintenance would be especially cumbersome should it have to be

UNCLASSIFIED 13

done remotely.

In summary, e sodium graphite reactor should be as easy to maintain
as a boiling water reactor plent with the possible exception of the hinderances caused
by the heating elements attached to the system.

6. Fast Reactors :

Fast reactors generelly present ell the problems associated with
Sodium cooled reactors plus geveral unique problems of their own. Large fest
breeder reactors generating electric power place severe burdens on equipment.

This is especially true of the fuel handling facilities which must be designed for
e high degree of reliebility. |

As & result of frequent er — for fuel replacement, one per
week for the 100 mw electric Enrico Fermi Atomte Plant at startup, the fuel
hendling system must incorporate automatic, remote operated, fast moving com-
ponents in the system. The uee of sodium a8 a coolant adds additional problems
of sealing penetrations in the reactor shield in order to keep the sodium and its
assoclated vapors contained within the vessel end free fram contamination. The
resultant fuel handling system is complex; costly, and not adaptable to other
reactor types. Furthermore , the system as designed for the above mentioned plant -
cen never refuel the reactor while under load. It cannot be said that a fast
reector can never te refueled under load, however, the compactness of the machine
makes the removal of = fuel element risky since there: may not be enough excess
reactivity present to sustain eritieality. This is contrasted to a gas-cooled
reactor of similar low pressure vhich due to its large bulk, if using natural
ureatum, nay heve fuel elements removed end the loss compensated for by the control
rods, thus ‘ensbling recharging while under load.

In order to reduce the radiation effect on the components of the
fuel handing and control mechanisms, as much of the equipment as possible should

be located outeide the biological shield. Extensions are then required to reach

) UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED. 14

through this shield and to the reactor which is submerged under several feet of
sodium. It becomes apparent then that if a malfunction occurs, either in the fuel
handling or in the control mechani ens during operetion or refueling, the following
problems will be faced by meintensnce personnel:

1. Temperature ebove the submerged reactor core is more then T00

- degrees F even during shutdown for refueling..

2. Sodium is opaque and this means that much of the equipment
within the ‘reactor vessel cannot be seen. The internal heat generation of the
fuel elements makes it impossible to drain the sodium during e shutdown. This
clearly points up the need for relisble mechanisms inside the vessel.

3 Induced activity in mechaniems inside the vessel end the
continued activity of the core require remote methods of meintensnce, thus only
minor repel is ‘possible within the reactor vessel, However, since sll electrical
eemponents end drives ere loceted outside the bologleal shield in en eres of low
rediation, most maintenance of this equipment ig possible by direct means.

The ‘operating cost for & 500 mw fast breeder reactor ‘plant have
been estimated to be 1 m1 in 20).

In sumeary, e fast breeder reactor power plent requires the
installation of & complex end expensive (estimated at $1,500,000 for the Enrico
Fermi Atamic Pleat) fuel hendling eysten. The operation e and maintensnce of the

plant should pose problems of no greater nsgnltude than are faced by other reactor

types using liquid metals as coolants. However, in any installation where complex

componente operate and remain in unfavoreble enviromments 9 troubles are invited to )

& larger degree than would be present, under more favorable conditions.

Ba Circulating Fuel Reactors
The maintenance of eireulsting fuel reactors is complicated due to the
spreading of ectivity throughout ‘the system and ae a , result, ‘remote maintenance
is a necessity. Because of the spread of this high level activity, it may ‘be said

that circulating fuel reactors as & class are harder to maintain than the solid

UNCLASSIFIED
UNGLASSIFIED 15

fuel type of reactors described previously.
1. Aqueous Homogeneous Fuel Reactor

In e reactor of this type, gjueous fuel solutions of uranium: selts
are circulated through e core vessel where criticality occurs end thence through an
external heat exchanger end back through & cemned motor punp to the core. The fuel
solution leaving the core is no longer critical but does continue to emit
deleyed neutrons, which cause radioactivity to be induced in ell perts of the
circuleting system. Most of the metal present in the componente and connecting
pipe is stainless steel. After one day! g decay time, the ectivity remaining in stein-
less steel is largely due to cobalt which has 2 5.3 year half-life, hence the special
care required for paifitenance operations.

If the circulating fuel is kept below the eritical velocity, an
oxide film will form on the internal surfaces of the system and although this is
beneficial fram the standpoint of reduced corrosion etteck, it also is a source of
deposited activity when the system is drained for maintenance. It is hoped. that
decontamination by acld rinses will remove most of this deposited activity, ‘however,
the presence of the induced activity in the metal precludes any direct maintenance.

The. question mey arise as to the feasibility of operating and main -
taining a homogeneous reactor plant. Westinghouse Electric Corporation in conjunction
with The Pennsylvenia Power end. Light Company had studies made of this phase of the
proposed Pennsylvanta Advenced Reactor (215) Project (11,12). These analyses indt-

cated that maintenance is feasible.

However, the maintenence philosophy of this large scale, 150 mw
electric, reactor plent differs widely from that employed on the experimental
reactors constructed to date. It wae decided early in the design stage of the PAR
not to rely c on remote wet maintenance for the folloving reasons: : (13)

1. Hydrostatic pressures involved in flooding the plant
require increased structural strength in the shielding and vapor container.

2. Tnecreased costs in all electrical equipment end instrumen-

tation for vaterproof construction. UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED 5

3. Poseibility that shielding vater can enter and contaminate
the system. |

Lk. Deley time necessary to allow large pieces of equipment to
cool down before being submerged in shielding vater to avoid thermal ghock.

As & basic tenant of the maintenance philosophy, it wae decided
that only large components such as steam generators would be repaired in place,
thet is, within the vepor shield. The preferred maintenence procedure for all
other items ie to disconnect the faulty camponente es quickly es possible end
replace with a spare unit and then deconteminate and repair the feulty unit end use
it as a spare. This philosophy has limitations since e large capital investment
1s required for stocking standby equipment. For this reeegon, all four fuel circu.
lating loops of the PAR will be of the same "hand," thus permitting & emaller
stock of replacement parts.

Another decision meade early in the ‘PAR design program was to
eliminate all flanges end valves in the main 20 inch diemeter fuel circulating

loops. Therefore, efter the plant goes critical, any maintenance requiring

cutting the main loop ie dependent upon the development of successful remote

positioner, cutter-grinder, welder, and inspection devices. Since one might say

‘the future successful operation and maintenance of ‘the plant depends upon these devices,

Westinghouse is eqmitied to a sizable development program in this respect. Studies

have indicated that remote welding end inspection are feasible(1h).
Problems still to be solved in the homogeneous reactor design that

: to some extent are common to all reactors ere:

i 1. Insulation - When insulation is placed on components and

: piping it not - omy presents a problem as far gs removal with remote tools is
concerned, but it also hides the location and size of & defect. Eeeily detachable

resolved. After the leaking tube is found, plugging by remote means presents
further difficulties. Vertical steam generators may help alleviate this problem.
3. Repair of components - Faulty pieces of equipment, such as

eirculeting pumps, when removed from the reactor will be radioactive end hence if

.they ere to be salvaged, must be repaired using remote tools end manipulators.

These tools should be rugged and relieble in operstion in order to complete the
repair job once it has sterted. Techniques will have to be developed for the
application of these remote toole to every item in the plent as most will have to
be either replaced or repaired during the lifetime of the plant. Small items of
equipment might be screpped rather than repaired economically.

Estimates on the maintenance costs of homogeneous reactor plants
very from 0.70 mills/kwh to a figure of from 2 to 5 times the operating and
meintensnce costs of a comparable fossil fired stesm plant. The estimate of 0.70
mills/kwh was based on 1 per cent per year of the capitel investment of the turbine-
generstor plant plus 3 per cent per year of the capital investment of the reactor
plent. It vas estimated that meintenance of the reactor plamt would be of the
same order costwise &s that of an industriel chemical processing plant{15), The
estimate of 2 to 5 times the cost of a fossil fueled plant was based on the
dbservetion thet maintenance performed with remote tools end manipulators plus the
possible limited working time of personnel due to redistion levels would involve
longer periods of down time.

| As & group, circulating fuel reactors are the most difficult to
maintain. A survey of proposed, homogeneous circulating fuel reactors reveals that
the present philosophy is directed toward remote dry paintenance. This method of
maintenance depends elmost entirely on the use of remotely operated tools and
equipment which at the present are Just entering the development: stage. It seems
quite probable that a year vill be required before an ‘evaluation can be made of
this development program.

2. Fused Salt Homogeneous Reactors

The use of & fused selt homogeneous reactor system hes been proposed

&

for the attainment of high temperatures without the necessity for excessive pressures.
A reactor of this design retains most of the good features of & circulating fuel
reactor vith the added feature of low pressure camponents. One of the disad-
venteges acquired however, is the necessity for heating the circulating loop y dump
tanks, and other components in which the fused salt might be present. ‘The

problem is more difficult than that faced for example in sodtun cooled reactors
because the salts usually heave & higher melting point. The capacity of the pre-
heating equipment should be large enough to raise the loop temperature to at

least 1000 degrees F.

A feasibllity study on a fused salt reactor plant has been made by
the Oek Ridge School of Reector Technology(16). A duplex-campartmented shielding
design was adopted to fit their philosophy that no maintenance will be performed
inside the containment vessel while the resctor is critical.

The arrangement of the plent places the reactor, primary heat ex=
changers, and fuel dump tanks within the primary ehield. Located in six shielded
compartments around the primary system ere the primary loop sodium circulating pumps,
expansion tanks, drain end charge tanks, and intermediate heat exchangers.

Outside the shielding but isolated to prevent spreading of fires in case of
sodium leaks ere the steen generators end intermediate sodium pumps.

The primary shield is designed to protect personnel from decay

gemma only, since maintenance will not be performed ‘while the reactor 1s in

operation. Provisions are made for draining and flushing the sodium from 1ndividual

interneaiste heat exchanger circuits go that no rediosactive sodium is within the

compartment where maintenance is to be performed. The sides of the radiel com-

pertments serve es shields end provide protection from decay gemmas from the

radioactive sodium in adjacent ‘campartments. As & result, it 18 not necessary
to drain all the primary loops when only one circuit requires maintenance.
The equipment outside the containment vessel is non-radioactive

and may be maintained in the conventional manner. : Maintenance of the equipment

inside the conteimment vessel end shielded areas will require remote tools and
techniques. The major items which will require this special equipment are the
fuel circulating pumps, primary heat exchanger tube bundles, intermediate heat
exchanger tube bundles, end primary circuit sodium circulating PUMPS. -

Access to the fuel circuleting pumps end primary heet exchanger tube
bundles is through en opening in the top shield plug. Faulty pumpe cen be removed
and replaced by spare unite which vill be kept on hand.

The maintenance of the primary heat  exchenger tube bundles poses
more difficult problems. A leek in a tube bundle wouldintroduce sodium into the
fused fluoride salt fuel solution and dilute it, which might be onemethod of
identifying & lesk. However, the methods of determining which bundle is leaking and
consequently remotely cutting the feed lines to that bundle and blanking them off by
welding heave not yet been developed.

It is hoped that maintenance on the intermediate sodium systems cen
be performed directly in the shielded compartments after draining and flushing
the radioactive godium from the loop. | |

While this 1s only one of several proposed designs for fused salt
homogeneous reacbr systems, it 111ustrates most of the maintenance problems faced;
na nely, induced activity in 211 components touched by the circulating fuel,
decreased accessibility to primary end intermediate loops as a result of
shielding, end finally difficulty of access to faulty component should 2 method
such as induction heating be used &s & means of preheating. - Maintenance costs
for e plant of this type will probably Tun higher than for an aqueous homogeneous
resctor plant for the above reasons.

3. Liquid Metal Fueled Reactor

One of the many reactor concepis which eppesr promising for electric
power production is the liquid metel fuel reactor under development at Brookhaven
Rational Laboratory. A study (1 py the Babcock and Wilcox Company indicates the

feasibility of & reactor of this design. Included in the study progrem wae the

engineering deeign of & reactor which generates 550 mw of heat.

Maintenance of & liquid metal fuel reactor will not be easy. Most
of the problems faced in an aqueous homogenous system are present in this reactor
type; namely, induced ectivity in all components due to delayed neutron emission
form the circulating fuel, extensive shielding required because of activity in the
primary gysten and Polonium®l0 s end the requirement of & leek tight system to contain
the ectivated fuel end Po2l0, In eddition, heating facilities are required for the
piping and components , thus adding to the maintenance problem,

| The complexity of the heating problem may be 111ustrated in the
following manner. Should the heaters feil after the reactor has been critical for
some time, the decay heat of the fuel plus the expansion volumes in the blanket
end fuel systeme ghould prevent eoltd1 fication of the fuel and blenket liquids
with their accompanying volumetric expansions. However, if the heaters failed
during startup, no decay heat would be. present to prevent solidification and a
serious failure could occur. The results of his possiblity are duplicate heater
eircuits and stendby emergency d1esel-generator sets.

The use of shielded compartments for the circulating loops in the
intermediate systen will permit the isoletion of & single faulty intermediate
heat exchanger or primary coolant pump. However, even after a period of cooling
off and decontamination the equipment will still be quite active as . result of

induced activity end the presence of fiseion and corrosion products vhich remain

after decontamination. Removel of the equipment will of necessity be a remote
operation end will be a1ficult at best.

Be 1s the case ‘with aqueous hamogeneous reactors 5 the success of

the maintenance effort will depend. to e large degree upon the development of remote

cutting, welding, end inspection devices.

| It 1s understood thet design plenning for the IMFR is progressing
even though the problem of pitting on the inside of loop components hes not been
resolved. The significance of this problem on the maintenance aspects of the plent

could be tmportent ‘since heretofore corrosion, if it be that ) wae not considered
as design problem.

In the operaton end maintenance of a Teactor plant using bismuth
ae & fuel carrier, certain hazardous conditions exist because of the formation of

210n1cn is toxic end baxdto contain. For this reason, the lesk tightnees of

Po
the Eysten must be of & high level of integrity.

Operating and medntenance costs of the 550 mw liquid metal reactor
plant proposed in the Babeock and Wilcox feasibility ‘study are 0.60 mills/kwh.
In view of the complexity of the maintenance problems faced, this eppears to be a
‘rather low £1gure. |

Summarizing, 1t might be seid that & plent of this design would be
one. of the most difficult types to maintain. Activity throughout the system
requires shielaing which in turn reduces acceseibility to components, hesting
requirements edd to the operational and maintenance problems, and the formation of
Po 210 0 cegsttates a leak tight system. The possibility of corrogbn or r mass transfer
of metal could reduce the 1ife expectancy of the equipment and increase the maintenance
‘costs. | | | | | | |
