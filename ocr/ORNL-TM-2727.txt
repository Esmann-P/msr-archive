Abstract

Stress-strain behaviors which are representative of nuclear-
grade, or equivalent, graphites are described and discussed.
Since cyclic loading test results provide important insight into
the characteristics of graphite behavior, emphasis is placed on
results of this type. Monotonic loading curves aré also consid-
ered, and both stress versus longitudinal strain and stress
versus lateral strain curves are given for monotonic and cyclic
loading. The new results given in this report are combined with
results published in the literature to provide a unified descrip-
“tion of the observed behavior.

Keywords: graphite, materials testing, mechanical prop-
erties, compression, tensile properties, stresses, deformation,
heat treatment. :

Introduction

Many of the mechanical behavior characteristics of graphite have been
studied. This is especially true of nuclear-grade, or equivalent, graph-
ites as a class of materials. These graphites are generally made from
petroleum-coke and coal-tar pitch, but the same overall characteristics
are exhibited by graphites made from other binder and filler combinations
as well. It is the purpose of this report $0 bring out some of the salient
features of observed mechanical behavior in a unified fashion.

Important behavioral characteristics are described in the literature.
The se have been identified From monotonic and cyclic loading tests, but
there are certain aspects of cyclic loading behavior that either have not
been studied or have not been studied in detail. Therefore, additional
investigations were made to overcome this deficiency. Three types of cyclic
loading were considered, including (1) cycling of specimens, which were
preloaded in compression, between zero and a constant stress level less

than the preload stress value, (2) cycling in compression wherein the
specimens were only partially unloaded, and (3) cycling alternately in
compression and tension. Studies of the first two types have not been
reported previously, and studies of the third were used to experimentally
examine the validity of an often stated premise regarding reloading be-
havior. The results from these investigations when combined with avail-
able data provide important background information for constitutive equa-

tion development.

Mechanical Behavior

Despite material variations from grade to grade, from block to block
of a given grade, and from piece to piece within a given block, there are
definite characteristics of mechanical behavior associated with artificial
graphite as a class of materials. Most graphites are anisotropic, and
stress-strain data generally show that there is rotational symmetry of the
anisotropy in an element. That is, the material may be classified as
transversely isotropic.

The anisotropy is a result of the preferred orientation. of the coke.
particles used in the manufacture and the orientations of the crystallites
within the particles. Although the forming method, that is, molding or
extruding, governs the preferred orientations of the particles, this
method influences the character of the anisotropy only in terms of actual
measures of deformation resistance. Therefore, the characteristics to be

discussed are independent of forming method.

Synopsis of Reported Results*

 

It is common knowledge that, when a graphite specimen is loaded in
simple tension or compression, nonlinear stress-strain behavior is exhib-
ited from essentially zero stress to the failure stress. What is the
characteristic of this nonlinearity? By loading to a stress level less
than that at failure and unloading, one obtains a loading curve, OA, and

an unloading curve, AB, as shown schematically in Fig. 1. Since the

unloading curve does not retrace any part of the initial loading curve,
the behavior cannot be classified as nonlinear elastic. The nonlinearity
must be described in some other way.

It may be seen that the behavior exhibited is reminiscent of time-
independent elastic-plastic behavior ascribed to metals. When the speci-
men is fully unloaded, there is a residual strain, OB, as for materials
that undergo elastic and essentially time-independent plastic deformations.
The unloading curve, AB, is also nonlinear. On loading the specimen a
second time, the resulting curve is again nonlinear and a hysteresis loop
is formed between the unloading and reloading curves. Loading beyond the
stress corresponding to that at the unloading point, A, gives a curve
which becomes asymptotic to the curve that would have existed had unload-
ing never occurred.* There are no abrupt changes in the slopes of any of
the segments of, the entire curve.

The tensile strengths and the initial slopes of the stress-strain
curves (elastic moduli) are generally greater in the with-grain direction
than in the across-grain direction. There are pronounced differences be-
tween both stress and strain at fracture in tension and in compression.
Complete stress-strain diagrams for simple tension and compression are
plotted together in Fig. 2 (Ref. 2) to illustrate these differences in the
tensile and compressive behavior. The material is EGCR-type AGOT graph-
ite,t and the data are for the with-grain (parallel to the extrusion axis)
direction. Typically, fracture strains on the order of 0.1 to 0.2% and
1.0 to 2.0% are found in tension and compression, respectively, for nuc-
lear-grade, or equivalent, graphites.

Arragon and Berthier® performed compression test studies on 216 spec-
imens made from extruded, petroleum-coke, industrial graphite. Three types
of tests were used: (1) simple compression; (2) cyclic tests (loading-
unloading-reloading) in which the cycles were made from increasing stress

levels spaced at equal intervals; and (3) cyclic tests between zero stress

 

*This is an often stated premise which is based on many observations.
A direct experimental examination of this premise will be discussed later
in this report.

TEGCR-type AGOT graphite is a coarse-grained, nuclear-grade, extruded
graphite which was made by Carbon Products Division of Union Carbide Corp.

and a fixed maximum. The slopes of the stress-strain curves at the origin
for continued loading (type 1) were the same order of magnitude as given
by sonic measurements. Seldin? also found good comparisons between sonic
moduli and the slopes at zero stress as measured from tensile and compres-
sive stress-strain curves for several grades of molded graphite.

Arragon and Berthier found that cyclic compressive tests of type 2
cause the apparent density to increase. The hysteresis loops, which are
formed by loading, unloading, and reloading, increase in size with in-
creased maximum stress, and the slopes of straight lines connecting the
unloading and reloading points decrease with increased stress. (The slope
of a line connecting the two points of one cycle is termed the "paraelas-
tic modulus.")

A schematic diagram, which depicts the essential features of the be-
havior observed from a test of type 2, is shown in Fig. 3. The envelope
curve corresponds to that for simple compression. Arragon and Berthier>
also discovered that straight lines drawn through the unloading point and
the point of zero stress for each cycle converge at a single point as
shown in the figure. The coordinates of this point are both negative
( taking compression as positive), and it was reasoned that the existence
of this point is a manifestation of the history of the virgin specimen.

In each case, the reloading curves asymptotically approach the enve-
lope curve after each cycle of loading, unloading, and reloading. This
and the other details of the behavior, as described above, are generally
typical of the graphites being considered. Corrcborations can be found by
studying the results for extruded graphite reported by Losty and Orchard®
and for molded graphites by Seldin.?

In the case of test type 3, which was used in the study by Arragon

3 each specimen was subjected to 12 cycles. During the first

and Berthier,
cycles, the total deformations at the unloading and reloading points in-
creased with increased cycle number, but, after the sixth cycle, these
deformations were essentially constant, and the hysteresis loop was re-
traced on each subsequent cycle. The form of the hysteresis lcop remained
constant throughout the cyclic loading as did the paraelastic modulus.

There was a slight increase in apparent density during cycling.

A schematic diagram of the type behavior observed during the first
few cycles is shown in Fig. 4. Additional illustrations of this behavior,
as obtained by the present study, are given in Figs. 5 and 6. The latter
figures show results obtained from EGCR-type AGOT and from RVD* graphite,
respectively.

The initial slopes of the stress-strain curves, or Young's moduli,
for nuclear-grade, or equivalent, graphites are about the same in tension
and in compression. This is generally true for both the with-grain direc-
tion and the across-grain direction. However, exceptions may be found’ by
comparing across-grain data for some graphites. Close comparisons of
tensile and. compressive curves for a given direction also reveal that
there is a tendency toward greater deformation resistance in compression
than in tension. This especially is true for the across-grain direction.

The preceding discussion was limited to stress versus longitudinal
strain behavior. Stress versus lateral strain curves for these graphites
have different curvatures in tension and compression; the diagrams for
tension are concave,toward the stress axis, while those for compression

are convex. These observations were first reported by Seldin.*

Schematic
diagrams of the tensile and compressive behaviors are shown in Fig. 7.

In uniaxial compression tests, the transverse-to-longitudinal strain
ratios are essentially independent of stress, ylelding almost constant
values. However, the ratios in tension are functions of stress, decreasing
as the stress is increased. Figure 8, which shows the strain ratios for
EGCR-type AGOT graphite as functions of longitudinal strain,® provides a
clear illustration. In this figure, the subscript 3 refers to the paral-
lel, or with-grain direction, while the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to two
orthogonal (across-grain) directions in the plane of isotropy. (Trans-
verse isotropy is assumed.) The first of the double subscripts indicates
the direction of applied stress and the second indicates the direction of

induced strain. The vertical bars in the figure represent standard devia-

tions.

When a specimen is loaded and released, the transverse residual
strain is positive regardless of whether the load is a tensile or a com-
pressive one. Thus, the volume of a specimen pulled in tension and re-

leased is increased since all linear dimensions are increased.

Additional Investigations

 

The investigations reported in this section were made using speci-
mens with the design shown in Fig. 9. This particular design was selected
so that the specimens could be tested in either tension or compression.
The 0.100-in.-diam longitudinal hole was bored in each specimen to allow
for making permeability ‘measurements, and a smooth machine finish was
used, without grinding or polishing.

Each specimen was marked for gage location using a HB grade drafting
pencil to avoid scratching the surface and to provide indications that
would not be removed by heat treating the specimen at 3000°C (to be dis-
cussed later). The latter aspect is important because the specimens were
heat treated and reinstrumented twice in ‘some cases, and it was necessary
to mount the gages in the same location each time. They were instrumented
on opposite sides at the midpoint of the gage length with strain gages
oriented in the axial and circumferential directions. Budd Metalfilm,
type C6-121-A, strain gages with a 0.125-in. gage length were used.

Tensile tests were performed using steel clam-shell fixtures attached
to the ends and 0.20-in.-diam, stainless steel, stranded-wire cables for
transmitting the. load to the specimen. A specimen, réady for test, is
shown in Fig. 10. The campressive tests were carried out using a subpress
with a miniature load cell placed in the subpress below the specimen. By
placing the load cell at this location, inaccuracies in readings due to
plunger friction were eliminated. The test setup for compression testing
is shown in Fig. 11.

For those cases in which the specimens were heat treated, a 100 kw,
3000 Hertz induction furnace was used for this purpose. The inside dimen-
sions were a diameter of 9 in. and a length of 14 in., and the specimens
were heated in Argon at atmospheric pressure . The time to reach the 3000°C

temperature level was 45 minutes. The furnace was cooled from 3000 to

In the first series of tests, specimens from EGCR-type AGOT graph-
ite were subjected to the following program of loading. Each specimen
was loaded to a given stress level in compression and unloaded. It was
then cycled ten times between zero and a stress, o,, which was in the
range given by

2 o. < 0, < OL 2
where On is the maximum stress level, that is, the stress corresponding
to the first unloading point. In each case, the specimen was subsequently
loaded to failure. Two with-grain and two across-grain specimens were
tested, and both lateral, or transverse, and longitudinal, or axial,
strain versus stress diagrams were obtained. Compressive behavior was
chosen because relatively large stresses and strains can be induced with-
out failure.

Figure 12 shows the results for the with-grain direction. Here again
it may be seen that, when the specimens were loaded to failure after
being cycled, the stress-strain curves asymptotically approached exten-
sions to the initial loading curves that would have been obtained by con-
tinued loading beyond the unloading stress, a The hysteresis loops
exhibited by the stress-strain curves do not change in size and coincide
rather than change position along the strain axis during the first few
cycles, as was shown in Fig. L.

The curves for the across-grain specimens are shown in Fig. 13.

" Except for very slight deviations in the initial portions of the first
few reloading curves, the hysteresis loops are again retraced on each
cycle. Asymptotic approach to a monotonic loading curve upon loading to
failure may also be seen. |

Partial unloading characteristics were examined using a second set
of four with-grain and four across-grain EGCR-type AGOT graphite speci-
mens. A specimen was loaded in compression to a given stress level, Op
and unloaded. It was again loaded to a higher compressive stress level,

0» unloaded, reloaded to og, a second time, and unloaded. A companion

lcaded to the higher compressive stress level, o> partially unloaded,
reloaded to o,, and unloaded.

The stress-strain diagrams for two companion with-grain specimens
are shown in Fig. 14. The diagrams for a second set of with-grain speci-
mens are shown in Fig. 15, and Figs. 16 and 17 show the results for sets
of across-grain specimens. Co

The cyclic behaviors of the fully unloaded specimens follow the pat-
terns described earlier. An examination of the stress. versus longitudinal
strain curves reveals several features. The hysteresis loops increase in
size and the paraelastic. moduli decrease with increase in unloading stress
level, the total deformations increase upon loading a second time to the
higher compressive stress level, © n’ and the reloading curves became
asymptotic to extensions of the initial loading curves when the specimens
are loaded beyond oy The stress versus lateral strain curves are very
similar in character to the stress versus longitudinal strain curves.

In the case of partial unloading, hysteresis loops are again formed,
and the same general features that were observed for full unloading may
be seen. The hysteresis loops are smaller, but the segments of each curve
are entirely nonlinear. The asymptotic approach to the extension of the
initial loading curve in esch case corresponds to that for full unloading.

Since the details’ of the asymptotic approach feature are important
to the development of mathematical analogs to the material behavior, the
curves in Figs. 1k through 17 were carefully studied to provide quanti-
tative data. When a specimen is loaded to a stress level such as a mn’
unloaded either fully or partially, and reloaded, the reloading curve
undergoes an accelerated change in slope as the stress approaches the
stress, a at the ‘point, of unloading. This decelerated change persists
until the reloading curve essentially begins to trace what would have been
the extension to the initial losding curve provided unloading had not
occurred. The quantitative data obtained were the stress values at the
extrémities of the accelerated change region. The lower limit is denoted
by 0/ and the upper limit is referred to as o”. |

The values for o/ and ¢// were obtained by plotting the ratio of

longitudinal strain to stress as a function of stress. The data on either

side of o are described by straight lines with greatly different slopes.
The transition region then corresponds tc the region where accelerated
change in slope of the stress-strain diagram occurs, and the limits may
be determined. A typical example of the plots used for determining o’
and ¢’// is shown in Fig. 18.

The two stress levels, denoted by o/ and o//, and the value of a,
for each stress versus longitudinal strain curve are listed in Table 1.
Also included are the values for the ratios o’/o and o’[o .

The dots on the stress-strain diagrams of Figs. 14 through 17 mark
the limits of the transition regions. It may be seen from the table and
the figures that there is consistency between the values. The value of
o, is the same for all cases. In five of the eight cases, the o’ fo, ra-
tios are the same, and all ratios fall within the range from 0.93 to 0.97.
The upper extremities of the segments for full unloading are at higher
stress levels than those for partial unloading, which shows that asymp-
totic approach is achieved sooner in the latter case. For full unloading,
the c/o ratio ranged from 1.04 to 1.07, while this ratio ranged from
1.01 to 1.03 for partial unloading.

The final test series reported herein was used in an attempt to ex-

perimentally verify the asymptotic approach premise and to provide data

on cyclic behavior under alternate compressive and tensile loadings.
Studies on the validity of the asymptotic approach premise were motivated
by Seldin's? demonstrations that test specimens can be made to reproduce
their original stress-strain responses in the longitudinal and lateral
directions by heat treating them at their graphitization temperatures.
Provided it is generally true, this is a revolutionary discovery in graph-
ite testing, especially in the potential it provides for removing uncer-
~tainties in data analyses and interpretations that arise because of the
almost inevitable variations in graphite properties.

Pursuant to making the final studies regarding the cyclic behavior
of graphite, Seldin's method for removing deformation history was examined
using specimens made from ATJ, RVD, and EGCR-type AGOT graphites. The
maximum particle sizes are 0.006, 0.015, and 0.032 in., respectively.

The first two are molded graphites. Each specimen was subjected to the
following sequence of steps.

1. Heat treat at 3000°C for 60 minutes.

2. Load in tension to a predetermined stress level and unload.

3. Heat treat at 3000°C for 60 minutes.

4. Load in compression to a stress level greater than in. Step 2 and
unload.

5. Heat treat at 3000°C for 60 minutes.

6. Load in tension to the stress level of Step 2 and unload.

The first heat treatment was used to establish the graphitization tempera-
ture in each case.

Stress-strain curves for two with-grain specimens of ATJ graphite are
plotted in Fig. 19, where both the longitudinal and lateral strains are
shown. The curves for two across-grain ATJ specimens are plotted in Fig.
20. All stresses, tensile and compressive, and the corresponding longi-
tudinal strains are plotted as positive in all figures depicting results
from the heat treatment studies, and the transverse data are plotted in
an analogous manner. Note that the two strain scales for a given speci-
men are not the same; hence, the differences between lateral strain curves
are accentuated. Curve No. 1 is for the first loading in tension, No. 2
is for the compressive loading, and No. 3 is for the second loading in

tension.

The success of the heat treatment method for removing deformation
history is determined by comparing curves 1 and 3 for each specimen.
Since the second with-grain specimen failed during the second tensile
loading, comparisons are more difficult to make for the curves shown in
the lower part of Fig. 19. Figures 19 and 20 show that the history was
almost entirely removed by heat treatment. Although there is a small
decrease in deformation resistance between the first and second tensile
loading, the agreement between the curves is very good. This is true
for both the with-grain and across-grain directions. .

Some of the behavioral aspects which were discussed in the previous
section may be seen from these curves. The deformation resistances are
essentially the same in tension and in compression, with a very slight
tendency toward greater deformation resistance in compression than in
tension for the across- grain direction. The durvatures of the stress
versus lateral strain curves in tension are different from those in com-
pression, but the initial slopes are nearly equal. Finally, positive
residual lateral strains are incurred as a result of loading in tension.

The stress-strain curves shown in Figs. 21 and 22 are for two with-
grain RVD specimens and one across-grain specimen. Curves 1 and 3 for
the with-grain specimen are in good agreement. Again, slightly less
deformation resistance is found for the second loading in tension.
Although the differences between curves 1 and 3 are greater for the
across-grain specimen than in the above cases, the agreement is good.
Greater deformation resistance in compression than in tension may also
be seen in Fig. 22.

Results obtained from EGCR-type AGOT specimens are given in Figs.
23% and 24. The curves for the with-grain specimen again show that the
heat treatment was. reasonably effective. It was less effective for the
across-grain specimens, however, as may be. seen by- examining Fig. 24.
The second across- -grain specimen was not loaded to the same stress level
in tension during the first and third loadings, but this does not detract
significantly from the comparisons. Again, the across-grain specimens
exhibit greater deformation resistance in compression than in tension.

The above results for the three graphites show that, in general,

heat treating does almost entirely remove the prior deformation history

so far as stress-strain response is concerned. The greater differences
between the first and second tensile loadings for across-grain RVD and
AGOT specimens may be associated with opening of microcracks too large to
be healed by heat treatment. This conjecture is the most plausible for
the coarse-grained AGOT material.

In addition to the investigations just described, studies were made
to examine the influence of hold time at 3000°C. EGCR-type AGOT graphite
specimens were used, and the hold times were 20, 30, and 40 minutes (in
addition to the 60 minutes hold time used in obtaining the results already
discussed). The results were inconclusive because no definite trend with
hold time was established. However, it was decided that the longer hold
time is preferred to assure greater possibility for reproducible results.

Returning to the dual purpose series for examining the asymptotic
approach feature and for obtaining data on cyclic behavior under alternate
compressive and tensile loadings, three (two with-grain and one across-
grain) EGCR-type AGOT specimens were tested. After an initial heat
treatment at 3000°C for 60 minutes, the first loading for each specimen
was used to establish a one-cycle envelope curve. Each was loaded in
compression near that required for failure, unloaded, loaded in tension
to a given stress level, again near that required for failure, and un-
loaded. During preliminary tests it was found that a specimen will fail
in tension when the tensile strain, as measured from the zero stress
point, corresponds to that at failure for a virgin specimen loaded in
tension only, regardless of the position of the zero stress point.

The envelope curves are shown as short-dashed lines in Figs. 25, 26,
and 27. The apparent discontinuities in the slopes of the curves between
the tensile and compressive portions were caused by changing fixtures to
apply loads of different signs.

Each specimen was heat treated a second time under the same conditions
as above and retested. It was loaded in compression to a given stress
level, unloaded, loaded in tension, unloaded, loaded in compression to a
higher stress level than the first, and unloaded. The corresponding
curves are shown by the long-dashed lines in the figures. Finally, the
heat treatment and loading sequence was repeated using lower compressive

.- stress levels. The solid curves in the figures were obtained in this way.

Multi-Cycle Curves for a Heat-Treated EGCR-Type AGOT
Lo

The maximum tensile stress level was essentially constant for all load-
ings on a given specimen.

In all cases, the stress level for reloading approaches that at the
unloading point before a transition in slope occurs. The curvature of a
stress versus longitudinal strain curve generally changes rapidly in the
immediate vicinity of the unloading point, while the change for a stress
versus lateral strain curve occurs over a much wider stress interval.
Behavioral details for the stress versus longitudinal strain curves shown
as solid lines are difficult to detect because of the small scale. In
fact, the initial loading and reloading curves were separated in the fig-
ures for clarity. The discontinuities in slope attributable to changing
of loading fixtures are apparent in almost all cases. The hysteresis
loops and other aspects of the behavior are in accord with the results
from other cyclic tests.

Consider the stress versus longitudinal strain curves. The asymp-
totic approach feature at the lower stress levels is shown, but there is
some deviation as the unloading stress level is increased. However,
Figs. 25, 26, and 27 show that the upper portions of the dashed curves
lie above the envelope curve in two cases and below this curve in one
case. On the whole, asymptotic approach to an initial loading curve is
demonstrated by these data.

Additional support is given by the stress versus lateral strain
curves of Fig. 25, where the agreement with the envelope curve is excel-
lent. However, the stress versus lateral strain curves in Figs. 26 and
27 indicate that asymptotic approach is at most closely approximated.
Conversely, because the restoration of the original stress-strain response
by heat treating was shown to be less than perfect by the studies made to
examine this technique, fully satisfactory agreement would be difficult
to achieve.

As in the cases of the longitudinal strain curves for the two speci-
mens which show greater differences, the deviations from the envelope
curves for the lateral strains are in one direction. The two subsequent
loading curves in each case appear to define an envelope curve although

it is different from the one established during the first loading.
hl

A better selection for studies of this kind would have been ATJ
graphite specimens since heat treatment was shown to be more effective
for this than the other two materials examined. As demonstrated here,
discovery of the heat treatment method allows for detailed comparisons

where none could be made formerly.

Conclusions

This report describes the stress-strain responses of nuclear-grade,
or equivalent, graphites under monotonic and cyclic loading conditions.
Both stress versus longitudinal and stress versus.lateral strain data are
considered, and it is shown that consistent patterns of behavior are
identifiable from the results. These include differences in deformation
resistance in tension and compression and differences in strain-ratio
data for the two types of loading.

When a specimen that has been preloaded in compression is cycled in
compression between zero and given maximum stress levels, three behav-
ioral patterns are observed. For the case in which the maximum stress
levels are continually increased and all are greater than the preload
value on each subsequent cycle, the hysteresis loops become larger and
the paraelastic moduli decrease with increasing maximum stress. Cycling
between zero and the preload stress level produces hysteresis loops that
do not change with cycle number and the paraelastic moduli remain the
same. However, the loops translate along the strain axis for the first
few cycles, after which the loops coincide. Finally, cycling between
zero and a fixed maximum value which is less than the preload stress pro-
duces hysteresis loops that are essentially invariant both in size and
location with cycle number. In the case of a specimen which is loaded,
partially unloaded, and reloaded, hysteresis loops are formed by the
stress versus longitudinal strain and stress versus lateral strain curves.
Also, the reloading curves approach what would have been extensions to
the initial loading curves more rapidly than for the case of full unload-
ing. The approach to the extension of a continued loading curve on re-
loading is often assumed. Here, this postulate is shown to be supported

by data obtained from tests designed to examine its validity.

The use of heat treatment at the graphitization temperature essen-
tially removes the effects of prior deformation, so far as stress-strain
response is concerned. However, these heat treatments were more success-
ful in removing the prior deformation histories of ATJ and RVD graphites
than of EGCR-type AGOT graphite. Careful use of this technique is shown
to be of unique benefit for making comparisons of the stress-strain be-

haviors of a single graphite specimen under different loading histories.
