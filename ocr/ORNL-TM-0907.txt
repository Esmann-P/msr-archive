MSRE DESIGN AND OPERATIONS REPORT

Part VII
FUEL HANDLING AND PROCESSING PLANT

R. B. Lindauer
1. INTRODUCTION

The MSRE fuel-processing system was designed to remove oxides from
the fuel, flush, ‘and coolant salts and to Xecover uranium from fuel and
flush salts. The Ho -HF treatment for oxide removal will be used whenever
it is suspected that oxide contamination has occurred. The flush salt
will be treated after the initial flushing and shakedown operations and
after the system has been opened for maintenance. Fuel salt or coolant
salt could become contaminated through a leak in the system or difficul-
ties with the helium blanket system. Treatment of the coolant salt will
require salt transfer by means of transfer cans or a temporary heated
line. A decay time of at least four days will be required for evolution
of xenon before treatment of a fully irradiated fuel batch, since the
fuel-processing tank is not vented through the large charcoal beds.

Uranium will be recovered by volatilization with fluorine from flush

 

en
and fuel salts before changing from 35% enriched to highly enriched ura-
nium and at the end of the “program ‘before discarding the salt to waste.

‘At the present time there is no developed process for recovery of the

LiF and BeFo. A decay time of 30 days for flush salt and at least 90

days for a fully irradiated fuel ‘batch is desirable to reduce the amount

of volatile fission products. :

 
 

 

2. PROCESS DESCRIPTION

2.1 Hp-HF Treatment for Oxide Removal

2.1.1 Summary

Moisture or oxygen inleakage into the reactor salt system or use of
helium cover gas containing moisture or oxygen could cause oxide accumu-
lation in the salt and, eventually, precipitation of solids. In the flush
or coolant salts, the precipitated solid would be BeO, which has a solu-
bility of approximately 275 ppm at 1200°F (see Fig. 2.1). If the flush
salt is contaminated with fuel salt up to approximately 0.01 mole of zir-
conium per kg of salt (~1% fuel in flush salt) » there would be insuffi-
cient zirconium present to exceed the solubility of ZrO, at 1112°F, and
‘any precipitate would be BeO. Above this zirconium concentration, ex-
ceeding the solubility limit would cause ZrO, precipitation. The effect
of 10% contamination of the flush salt with fuel salt is shown in Fig.
2.1. The solubility of Zx0z varies with temperature and zirconium con-
centration as shown in Figs. 2.1 and 2.2. The dashed lines in Fig. 2.2
indicate extrapolation of data above 0.5 mole of zZr*+t per kg of salt.

The oxide solubility in fuel salt is probably not as high as this extrapo-
lation indicates.

Zirconium tetrafluoride was added to the fuel salt as an oxygen
getter to prevent small amounts of oxygen from causing uranium precipi-
tation. Table 2.1 shows the maximum amount of oxide that can be tolerated
before zirconium and uranium oxides precipitate in flush salt containing
small amounts of fuel salt. When UO, starts to precipitate, ZrO; will
continue to precipitate. The ratio of zirconium to uranium in the pre-
cipitate will be 5:1 at 932°F or.3.8:1 at 1112°F. These ratios will be
slightly lower if the amount of fuel salt present is large. With pure
fuel salt the ratio is 1.5:1, and more than 14,000 ppm of oxide will be
required before uranium will precipitate.

Operation of the reactor with precipitated solids is to be avoided.
Even operation with high concentrations of dissolved oxides could result

in collection of oxides on relatively cold surfaces, such as the tubes

on,

in the heat exchanger and the access nozzle on the reactor vessel. At
present the oxide concentration cannot be measured with sufficient ac-
curacy for us to kmow whether the salt is saturated. Until the analytical
methods are improved, the oxide concentration will be kept low by treat-
ing the salt at regular intervals and when there has been an opportunity
for considerable moisture to enter the reactor system. Moisture could
enter if helium of high moisture content were used for cover gas or if
the system were open to the atmosphere during long periods of maintenance.
Oxides will be removed by treating the fuel or flush salt in the
fuel storage tank (see Fig. 2.3) with a mixture of Hp and HF gas. In
the treatment process, “HF will react with the oxide to form the fluoride
and water, which will be evolved along with the hydrogen and excess HF.
The Hr will prevent excessive ‘corrosion of the INOR-8 structural material
by maintaining a reducing condition in the salt. The gases will pass

through an NaF bed for decontamination before cold trapping for water

‘determination. The gas stream will then pass through a caustic scrubber

for neutralization of the HF. The hydrogen will go to the off-gas system.

"The treatment will be terminated when water is no longer detected in the

off-gas stream. A final sparging with hydrogen will remove dissolved HF
and FeFsz.

2.1.2 Hydrofluorination

Hydrogen fluoride will be obtained in 100-1b cylinders. One cylinder
will provide sufficient HF for 92 hr of processing at a flow rate of 9
liters/min (Hp : HF = 10:1). The HF cylinder will be partially submerged

in a water bath heated with low-pressure steam to provide sufficient pres-

sure for the required flow rate. Since heating of the cylinders above:
125°F is not recommended, there is a pressure alarm on the exit gas set
at 25 psig. The HF gas will pass through an electric heater to raise the
temperature above 160°F and reduce the molecular weight to 20 for accurate
flow metering. The hydrogen flow will be started before the HF flow to
minimize corrosion. The hydrogen flow rate will be set at the rotameter

at the gas supply station west of the building. The hydrogen fluoride

flow rate will be regulated by the controller on the panelboard in the

high-bay area. The salt backup prevention valve must be closed with the
manual switch until flow is started, at which time the differential pres-
sure switch will maintain the valve in the closed position unless the
tank pressure exceeds the Hp-HF pressure.

From experience with an Tnconel vessel in the Engineering Test Loop,
corrosion is expected to be negligible after the surface is depleted of
chromium and iron. The equilibrium amount of nickel in solution with a
10:1 ratio of Hy to HF is less than 1 ppm. - Co RX

~The’ off-gas stream leaving the fuel storage tank will consist of

+ hydrogen, water, excess hydrogen fluoride, and helium. Volatilization

of fission and corrosion products is expected to be much lower than dur-

ing fluorination because of “the reducing effect of the hydrogen. Fission

~ “products that are partially volatilized as fluorides during fluorination,

such as ruthenium, niobium, and antimony, are expected to exist in the

metallic state. Any chromium in the salt from corrosion is expected to
be in the nonvolatile +2 or +3 valence state. The off-gas stream will

pass through a heated line to the NaF trap. The. line will be heated to
200°F to prevent condensation of H0-HF.

 
 

 

IL)

Since corrosion and fission-product volatilization will not be severe
during Hp-HF treatment, the salt will be maintained at 1112 * 20°F, which
is approximately 200°F higher than during fluorination. At the higher
temperature the conversion of oxide to water will be more rapid.

The hydrogen fluoride flow will be stopped when no more water is de-
tected in the off-gas stream. The salt temperature will then be increased
to 1300 + 20°F and the hydrogen flow will be continued to remove dissolved
hydrogen fluoride and to reduce the amount of FeFz in solution. It should

om

be possible to reduce the dissolved iron to the 200-ppm level obtained in

the salt production operation. Any iron returned to the reactor system .
will cause corrosion by attacking any exposed chromium. When the salt

samples show that further reduction of iron is not practical, the hydrogen

flow will be stopped, and the salt will be sparged with nitrogen for 8 hr

to purge the gas space of hydrogen.

2.1.3 NaF Trapping
A remotely removeble NaF bed is provided in the fuel-processing cell

to remove small amounts of volatilized fission or corrosion products from
the off-gas stream. The trap will be maintained at 750°F to prevent ad-
sorption of HF. Since the vapor pressure of HF over NaF is 1 atm at 532°F,
the trap could be operated at a somewhat lower temperature, but 750°F will
be required to prevent UFg adsorption during fluorination (see Sect. 2.2.3),

and this temperature was selected for both operations.

[1

2.1.4 Monitoring for Water

The removal of oxides from the salt will be followed by observing the >

volume of water and HF cold trapped from the off-gas stream. The entire

gas stream, consisting of helium, hydrogen, water vapor, and excess hydro-

gen fluoride, will pass through a cold trap. The temperature can be.

varied between O and 40°F. Since the ratio of water to hydrogen fluoride

in the off-gas stream leaving the fuel storage tank will be a function of

the oxide content of the salt ,t the HF utilization versus the oxide con-

tent can be calculated from ‘this relationship, ‘as shown in Fig. 2.4. The

solubility of oxide in fuel salt is high, and therefore the equilibrium o

HF-to-H,0 ratio in the off-gas will be high (low HF utilization). This
could result in long treatment times for removing large quantities of
oxide from fuel salt. Since accurate solubility data for the fuel salt
are still being measured, the utilization curve for fuel salt is not
shown.

The amount of water and hydrogen fluoride that will be carried with
the hydrogen-helium off-gas stream from the trap can be calculated from
the vapor pressure of water and HF over the condensed liquid. By means
of a material balance, the amount of condensed liquid to be expected was
calculated as a function of the oxide content. The amount of condensed
liquid for a cold trap temperature of O°F and an Hp-to-HF ratio of 10:1
is shown in Fig. 2.5. The condensate volumes in Fig. 2.5 do not include
the untrapped water, which should amount to less than 2% and can be ig-~
nored. If melts containing very large amounts of oxide are being treated,
the HF utilization at the start will be slightly higher than shown due
to Zr(OH)4 formation, but the curve shown should be reasonably accurate
at the oxide levels expected.

The condensed HF-H20 will be collected in a small pot that will
siphon automatically when full. Each siphoning will remove approximately
55 cc. The number of siphonings will be recorded on a temperature re-
corder that will detect the cold liquid as it passes through the siphon
tube to the caustic scrubber. The siphon pot and cold trap will be cooled
by circulating brine.

2.1.5 0Off-Gas Handling

The hydrogen fluoride will be neutralized in a static caustic scrubber
tank. Hydrogen and helium from the scrubber will pass through an activated-
charcoal trap and a flame arrester before entering the cell ventilation
duct. The cell ventilation air will pass through an absolute filter, lo-
cated in the spare cell, before going to the main filters and stack. As

mentioned before, little activity is expected in the off-gas stream during
Ho-HF treatment.

Since the fluorine disposal system will not be used during Hp-HF

treatment but will still be connected to the scrubber inlet line, the

system must be purged to prevent diffusion and condensation of H,O0-HF in
the disposal system. This will be done by connecting N> cylinders at the
S02 cylinder manifold. As an additional precaution, the SO; preheater
should be heated, because the stainless steel preheater would be especially
subject to corrosion by the wet HF.

2.1.6 Liquid Waste Disposal

The caustic scrubber will be charged with 1300 liters of 2 M KOH
prepared by dilution of a 45% KOH solution. Three 115-gal batches of
2 M (10%) KOH will be prepared in a portable mix tank in the high-bay
area and charged through a line provided with & manual valve and a check
valve. Dilution to 2 M will be required because of the possibility of
gel formation in KF solutions of greater than 2 M.

At 9.1-1liters/min HF flow, the KOH will have to be replaced every
4 days when the final concentration is 0.35 M. It will, therefore, be
necessary to jet the KOH solution to the liquid waste tank and replace
it with fresh caustic when a 100-1b HF cylinder has been consumed.

2.2 Uranium Recovery

2.2.1 Summary
The fuel or flush salt should be allowed to decay as long as possible

before fluorination to minimize the discharge of the volatile fission-
product fluorides that will be formed by the oxidizing action of the
fluorine. The most important volatile activities are iodine, tellurium,
niobium, ruthenium, and antimony, and large fractions are expected to
plate out on metal surfaces of the equipment. .

After decay, the salt batch will be fluorinated in the fuel storage
tank. The off-gas containing UFg, excess fluorine, and volatile activity
will pass through a high-temperature NaF trap for decontamination and
chromium removal before absorption on low-temperature NaF absorbers. Ex-
cess fluorine will be reacted with S02 to prevent damage to the Fiberglas
filters. Before filtration the off-gas will be further decontaminated by
passage through a caustic scrubber and an activated charcoal bed.

The absorbers will be transported to the Volatility Pilot Plant where
they will be desorbed and the UFg cold trapped and collected in product

cylinders.

2.2.2 Fluorination

Uranium will be recovered from the molten salt by sparging with fluo-
rine to convert the UF, to volatile UFg. The fluorine will be diluted
with an equal volume of helium when fluorine is detected in the off-gas
stream to reduce the number of times the fluorine trailer and the caustic
in the scrubber must be changed. This should have little effect on the
overall processing time, since utilization is expected to be low after
most of the uranium has been volatilized. A total gas flow of about 100
liters/min should provide good agitation. The salt sample line will be
purged with helium during fluorination to prevent UFg diffusion and will
be heated to prevent condensation. The temperature of the melt will be
maintained as low as practical (~20 to 30°F above the liquidus of 813°F)
to keep corrosion and fission-product volatilization to a minimum. Boil-
ing points of some volatile fluorides are listed in Table 2.2. While all
the iodine and much of the tellurium is expected to volatilize, only a
small fraction of the ruthenium, zirconium, niobium, and antimony should
leave the salt. The heaters on the upper half and top of the tank will
not be used during fluorination to reduce salt entrainment, but they will
be turned on after fluorination to melt down splatter and condensation.

There will be an initial induction period before evolution of UF
begins. The extent of this period will. depend on the amount of uranium

in the salt and the degree of ‘agitation of the salt. A minimum of 0.5
mole of fluorine per mole of uranium will be required to convert, all the
~ UF; to UFs. After this, Fe will begin to form and be evolved... At 100

liters/min of fluorine, UFe evolution can begin about 2 hr after the
start of fluorination. Since the vapor space between the salt and the

“first absorber is ~1300 liters, another 15 min will probably be required

before absorption begins.
Volatility Pilot Plant date show that essentially no fluorine is

evolved until at least 1 mole of fluorine per mole of uranium has been

added or the system has operated 4 hr at 100 liters/min. However, until
more is known about the sparging efficiency and the effect of the fuel
storage tank geometry and salt composition, the fluorine disposal system
should be put in operation 2 hr after the start of fluorine flow with

sufficient SO, to react with 50 liters of fluorine per minute.

Evolution of UFg will be followed by means of the absorber tempera~ :

tures. Fluorine breakthrough should be detectable by temperature rise
in the fluorine reactor. When fluorine breakthrough is detected, the
fluorine flow will be reduced to one-half and an equal flow of helium
will be started. This will maintain the necessary degree of mixing
while providing sufficient fluorine to prevent the back reaction

With the 35%-enriched uranium fuel: salt, it will be necessary to re-
place the absorbers two times. Before this can be done, the salt must be
sparged with helium for 2 hr to remove dissolved UFg and fluorine and to
purge the gas space of UFg. At the end of the fluorination, when UFg is
no longer detected in the gas stream entering the absorbers, the fluorine
flow will be stopped and the batch sparged with nitrogen for 2 hr. After
sparging for absorber changes and at the end of fluorination, the salt
will be sampled to check on the uranium removal.

It will be necessary to replace the fluorine trailer every 2 hr at
a fluorine flow rate of 100 liters/min or every 4 hr with one-half flow.
There is sufficient space at the gas supply station to have only one
trailer connected at a time. Additional trailers will be at the site,
however, so downtime should not be long.

Corrosion will be much more severe under the strongly oxidizing con-
ditions of fluorination than during the Hy -HF treatment. A corrosion
rate of 0.5 mil/hr was experienced in the Volatility Pilot Plant in a
nickel vessel. ‘Fluorination of the high-uraniun-content salt (fuel salt
c) may take as long as 24 hr, but recovery of small amounts of uranium
from the flush salt and uranium recovery from highly enriched fuel should
require much less time. A 24-hr fluorination would" cause an average cor-
rosion of approximately 3% of ‘the fuel storage tank wall at 0.5 mil/nr.
Corrosion of the fuel storage tank may be somewhat less because of the
lower fluorination temperature; also, corrosion tests indicate that INOR-8

may be more corrosion resistant than nickel.

2.2.3 NaF Trapping

The NaF bed will be important during fluorination for uranium re-

covery because of ‘the greater volatilization of fission and corrosion’

products than during oxide ‘removal. The bed will again be maintained .

at 750°F, that is, above the decomposition temperature of the UFg-2NaF
complex (702°F at 1000 mm). Any volatilized PuFe will absorb on the
NaF and provide separation from the uranium. Sodium fluoride ‘at 750°F
will remove greater than 90% of the niobium and ruthenium from the fluo~

rinator off-gas stream, and these will be the principal activities that

 
 

 

16

could cause product contamination. More iodine and tellurium will vola-
tilize, but they will not absorb on hot or cold NaF. Essentially all the
chromium fluoride will be absorbed. Chromium is troublesome not only
because of the gamma activity of the 51Ccr formed by neutron activation
but also because of the inactive chromium that will collect in valves

and small lines and cause plugging and seat leakage. All piping to and
from the NaF bed must be heated to above 200°F to prevent UFg condensa-
tion. Table 2.3 shows the expected behavior of the volatile fluorides
on NaF.

Table 2.3. - Fluoride Absorption on NaF

Antimony Yes Less than at 750°F
Ruthenium Yes Less than at 750°F
Plutonium Yes Less than at 750°F
Chromium Yes Less than at 750°F

 

2.2.4 UFg Absorption
The decontaminated UFg gas from the 750°F NaF bed will flow to five

NaF absorbers in series, which are located in a sealed cubicle in the
high-bay area. These absorbers will be cooled with air, as required, to
prevent uranium loss. At 300°F the vapor pressure of UFg over the UFg<2NaF
complex will be O.1 mm, and uranium losses will be significant (0.132 g

of U per minute with a flow of 100 liters/min). The capacity of NaF for
UF¢ varies inversely with the temperature, since the more rapid reaction
at higher temperatures inhibits penetration of the UF¢ by sealing off

"

»

17

the external pores with UFg 2NaF. 2 To obtain maximum capacity the cool-
ing air should therefore be turned on as soon as a temperature rise is
indicated. Also, with low fluorine concentration at elevated tempera-
tures there could be a reduction of UFg<2NaF to UFs5-2NaF, which would
remain with the NaF when the UF¢ was desorbed from the NaF. The loading
of the absorbers can be followed by bed temperatures, and the air can be
adjusted as required. The air will be discharged to the cell by a small
blower in the cell.: -

Alpha activity monitors in the cubicle and in the cell and vessel
off-gas streams will be used to detect leaks of UFg. In the event of a
leak in the absorber cubicle, the fluorine flow would be stopped and the
cubicle would be purged with air and opened for repairs. The location
of the leak should be detectable either visually or with an alpha probe.

When fluorination has been completed, the absorbers will be discon-
nected and sent to the Volatility Pilot Plant for desorption and cold
trapping of the UFg. The maximum radiation level at contact will be less
than 100 mr/hr. When processing. fuel salts A or C; which have higher
uranium molarity than salt B, it will be necessary to stop fluorination
when the absorbers are loaded and replace the absorbers as noted above.
This will require a complete purging of the system to get all UFg out
of the connecting piping.

 

2.2.5 Excess Fluorine Disposal

Since an average efficiency of less than 25% is expected during

~ fluorination, there will be a large excess of fluorine. If this fluorine
were allowed to flow through the off-gas filters ; damage to the Fiberglas
might result with release of. any. accumulated activity. To prevent this,

the excess fluorine will be reacted with an excess of S02. Both the S02

and the TF; will be preheated electrically to 300 to 400°F and then fed
into a Monel reactor wrapped with steam coils. The steam will serve the

dual purpose of keeping the reactor warm to initiate the reaction and of

cooling the reactor after the reaction is started. The reaction is

strongly exothermic and proceeds smoothly at 400°F. The product is S0xF,,
a relatively inert gas, which will pass through the caustic scrubber, -the

 
 

18

activated-charcoal trap, the chemical plant filter, and the main filters
and stack.

2.2.6 Off-Gas Handling

The fluorination off-gas stream, after reaction of the fluorine with
-502- will pass through a caustic scrubber. - The excess S02 and the SOF;
will be partially neutralized by the caustic. However, the main purpose
of scrubbing the fluorination off-gas is for the removal of fission prod-
ucts, since the S50; and S0,F; can be safely passed through the: filter
system. The scrubber tank off-gas will pass ‘through an activated-charcoal
. trap for additional fission-product removal before entering the cell ven-
tilation duct just upstream of the absolute filter in the spare cell.
- The cell air will then go to the main filters and be discharged from the
100-ft containment stack.

2.2.7 Liquid Waste Disposal

The caustic scrubber will be charged with 1300 liters of 2 M KOH.
This will be sufficient caustic for the complete neutralization of 50
liters of SO; per minute for 8 hr with a final molarity of 0.33. Since
some of the SO; will be consumed by unreacted fluorine and the SOF, is
expected to hydrolyze slowly, changing the caustic solution every 8 hr
should provide a considerable margin of safety against the solution be-
coming acidic. The 8-hr caustic cycle will begin at the start of SO;
flow (2 hr after the start of Fo flow).

When processing has been stopped for replacement of the caustic (and
for salt sampling and replacement of the fluorine trailer), the batch will
first be sparged with helium for 1 hr to remove dissolved UFg and Fa and
-reduce corrosion during downtime. After sparging has been completed, the
caustic solution will be jetted to the liquid waste tank, and fresh
caustic will be charged to the scrubber.

2.2.8 Waste Salt Handling

After removal of uranium from the fuel salt, it is planned to add
0.2 mole % of highly enriched uranium (salt B) to the salt and proceed

 

 
»

with the second phase of the program. After the second phase is complete,
thorium and additional uranium will be added to the same salt to form
salt A. Unless some unforeseen contamination of the fuel salt occurs that
renders it unsuitable for further use , the same salt should be usable for
the entire program.

At the end of the program the salt will be held molten in either the
fuel storage tank or one of the drain tanks until it is certain the salt
will not be required for further operations or samples. A heated, insu-
lated line is provided from the fuel storage tank through the shielding on
the east wall to the’ spare cell for eventual removal of the salt. The dis-
posal method has not been determined at this time. This line can also be
used for salt removal if this is required before the end of the program.
When not in use the line is sealed by a freeze valve in the fuel-process-

ing cell and a blind flange in the spare cell.

3. EQUIPMENT DESCRIPTION

3.1 Plant Iayout

The main portion of the fuel-handling and -processing system is in
the fuel-processing cell, immediately north of the drain tank cell in
Building 7503, as shown in Figs. 3.1 and 3.2. The gas supply station is
outside the building, west of the drain tank cell. The off-gas filter,
hydrogen flame arrester, activated-charcoal trap, and waste salt removal
line are in the spare cell east of the fuel-processing cell. The system
will be operated from the high-bay area over the cell, where a small in-
strument panelboard is located. Also in the high-bay area are the salt-
charging area, the UFg absorber cubicle, the salt sampler for the fuel
storage tank, and an instrument cubicle. The instrument cubicle contains
the instrument transmitters and check and block valves connected directly
to process equipment, and it is sealed and monitored. Figures 3.3 and
3.4 are photographs of the fuel-processing cell and the operating area,
respectively.

3.2 Maintenance

Since corrosion is expected to be very low during H,-HF treatment and
only two or three fluorinations are planned, maintenance problems are not
expected to be severe. The system, with a few exceptions, has therefore
been designed for direct maintenance, with savings in cost and complexity
of equipment. The exceptions are the NaF trap and two air-operated valves.
The NaF trap may become plugged by volatilized chromium fluoride during
fluorinstion and must be removed from the system before aqueous decontami-
nation. It is therefore flanged into the system and has disconnects for
thermocouples and electrical power. The valves have flanges with vertical
bolts and disconnects for the air lines. The valves and trap are located
under roof plugs sized to pass through the portable maintenance shield.
This shield can also be used for viewing and for external decontamination
of equipment should this be required because of a leak. All heaters in —
the cell have duplicate spares installed. \o/

If a piping or equipment leak occurs, or if entrance into the cell
is required for other reasons after irradiated fuel has been processed,
aqueous decontamination will be required. The recommended method is de-
scribed in report ORNL-2550 (ref. 3) and consists of (1) barren salt
flushes to displace as much as possible of the irradiated salt, (2) aqueous
ammonium oxalate flushes to remove the salt film, (3) nitric acid-eluminum
nitrate flushes to remove metallic scale from the surfaces, and (4) sodium
hydroxide-hydrogen peroxide—sodium tartrate flushes for gas line decon-
tamination. More detalls on these decontamination procedures are given
in Section 5.3.

3.3 In-~Cell Equipment

3.3.1 Fuel Storage Tank

The fuel storage tank in which chemical processing will take place is
similar to the reactor drain tenks. The tank is shown in Fig. 3.5, and
design data are given in Table 3.1.

The height of the storage tank was increased by 30 in. over the height
of the drain and flush tanks to minimize salt carryover due to sparging
during chemical processing. About 38% freeboard is provided above the
normal liquid level.

The tank is heated by four sets of heaters in the bottom, the lower
half, the upper half, and the top of the tank. Each set of heaters is
controlled separately with variacs. Every heater has a duplicate installed
spare with leads outside “the cell. The heaters are mounted on & frame that

is supported from the floor to minimize the tare weight on. the weigh cells.

The fuel storage tank is provided with air cooling to permit receiving

fully irradiated fuel salt after four days decay (the minimm time deter-
mined by xenon evolution). Since the fission afterheat load of a fuel

batch that has decayed four days after a full-power year of operation will
be greater than 25 kw (see Fig. 3.6) and the maximum expected heat loss

from the fuel storage tank is: approximately 18 kw, some method of cooling
was required, If the minimum expected heat loss (5 kw) from the tank were
realized, cooling would be required after one full-power year of operation

unless over 100 days decay was allowed. Therefore, to avoid possible long:
decay times before being able to transfer a fully irradiated fuel batch
to the fuel storage tank for hydrofluorination or in case it was necessary
to remove the batch from the drain tank cell to permit maintenance opera-
tions, cooling of the fuel storage tank was desirable.

A simpler, less expensive method of cooling than the boiling-water
cooling in the drain tanks was desired. A preliminary study* indicated
that cooling by natural air convection was feasible with only 2 1/2 hr
decay. A maximum heat load of 72 kw was assumed with an air temperature

rise from 150 to 660° F. However, the cooling requirement in the fuel
storage tank will be much less than 72 kw for the following reasons:

1. A minimum decay time of four days will be used instead of 2 1/2
hr. : ne

2. The operating period will probably be less than one full-power
year,

3. Some gaseous fission products will be stripped in the pump bowl
and some will plate out on cooler surfaces in the reactor system.

4. A heat loss of 5 to 18 kw is expected through the tank insulation
and by radiation.

Instead of natural convection, a positive air flow is provided by
routing the cell exhaust air through a l-in. annular space between the
fuel storage tank wall and the tubular heaters on the inside of the in-
sulation support can. A thin stainless steel sheet is installed in ‘this
annular space about 2 ft from the top of the tank to restrict air flow up
the tank wall when the dampers are closed. It will also be necessary to
seal all penetrations through the top cover as well as possible to prevent
unwanted air flow. A 1-ft2? opening with a gravity damper is provided at
the bottom of the tank. There is a similar opening through the side of

“the insulation support can at the normal liquid level. This outlet line

has a motor-operated damper and is ducted directly to the cell air ex-
haust. When cooling is not required, this damper is closed and another
motorized damper, which allows cell air to bypass the fuel storage tank,

‘is opened. With a 30-kw load‘and 500 £t3/min of air flow (the nominal

cell exhaust rate), an air temperature rise of approximately 200°F has
been calculated. LT : PI eed

~The tank has two dip tubes, one for gas sparging and the other for
charging and discharging salt. The sparge line is a 1-in. pipe that is
closed at the bottom and has four 1/2-in. holes 90° apart near the bottom.

| The salt dip tube lies on the bottom of the tank at the center to minimize

holdup (approximately 0.1% of a batch). Liquid level is determined by
weighing the tank with two pneumatic weigh cells. The weigh cell calibra-
tion can be checked by two single-point level probes. Other instruments

provided are 13 surface-mounted thermocouples end a pressure-recorder alarm.

C

An interlock is provided that prevents salt backup In the gas sparge
line in case the tank pressure exceeds the sparge-gas pressure. Another
interlock prevents backup of tank off-gas (UFg, HF, Fp, or fission gases)
into the sample line, which is also connected to the pressurization—
pressure recorder line in the high-bay area. This is done by closing the
HF-F, valve if the tank pressure exceeds the helium purge pressure, The
vent valve in the off-gas line opens if the tank pressure exceeds the
design pressure of 50 psi. The tank pressure will alarm above the normal

[1

pressure of 5 psi to indicate any plugging in the off-gas line, trap,

valves, absorbers, or caustic scrubber. :

3.3.2 NeF Trap

The NaF trap will be required mainly during fluorination to provide
additional decontamination of the UFg gas and to remove volatile chromium
fluorides from the gas stream. A kilogram or more of chromium fluoride
could be volatilized during fluorination, and it would collect in lines
and valves and eventually cause plugging. The trap is shown in Fig. 3.7
and design data are given in Table 3.2. --

The gas enters on the outside of an internal cylindrical baffle and
leaves inside the baffle, and thus the gas path is almost 2 ft for a 12-in.
depth of pellets. Gas velocities are kept below 4 ft/min to prevent
carryover of fines containing absorbed fission-product fluorides.

The trap has thermowells at the inlet, center, and exit. Heat is
controlled by separate variacs for the center and the outside of the bed. -
Spare heaters are installed.

Since there is a possibility of plugging of this trap with chromium :
during fluorination, it is designed for remote replacement. The inlet
and exit lines are provided with ring-joint flanges at the trap and some
distance away to permit removal of sections of the lines for access to
the trap. Thermocouple and electrical disconnects are provided on the
trap, and a standard lifting bale is mounted on a strap over the trap.
Before the first fluorination of radicactive fuel, & spare unit will be
fabricated.

The trap will be removed from the cell if aqueous decontamination is
necessary to permit direct maintenance on cell components. In this case
the trap will be replaced with a Jumper line to permit flow of solutions
through the entire system. Since the bed will be very radioactive after
fluorination of irradiated fuel, it may not be feasible to decontaminate

and reuse the vessel after removal from the cell.

3.3.3 Cold Trap

The extent of oxide removal from the salt during Hp-HF treatment will
be determined by cold trepping the off-gas stream and measuring the volume
of water and HF condensed. The cold trap is shown in Fig. 3.8, and design
data are given in Table 3.3. The inlet end of the trap is in the northwest
corner of the cell and the trap extends eastward with a 3° slope. The in-
let and outlet brine connections are reducing tees at each end of the
Jacket.

3.3.4 Siphon Pot

The condensate from the cold trap collects in a pot that automatically
siphons when full. The pot is shown in Fig. 3.8, and design data are given
in Table 3.3. The exit gas passes over a thermowell for accurate deter-
mination of the off-gas temperature. The pot is cooled by the brine before
the brine enters the cold-trap jacket. The siphon tube has a surface ther-
mocouple outside of the thermal insulation to detect each siphoning.

3.3.5 Caustic Scrubber

The caustic scrubber is shown in Fig. 3.9, and design data are given
in Table 3.4. The tank is provided with coils enclosed in a heat-transfer
medium. During H,-HF treatment, cooling water will be circulated through
the coils to remove the heat of HF neutralization. During fluorination,
it may be desirable to use steam to maintain the caustic solution at an
elevated temperature for better tellurium scrubbing.

The tank is provided with a thermowell, a liquid-level bubbler tube,
and a jet suction line. The used caustic is jetted to the liquid-waste
tank when the molarity has been reduced from 2.0 to approximately 0.3 M
KOH. A caustic charging line is provided from the high-bay area.

~The off-gas from the scrubber tank is routed to the spare cell where
it passes through an activated-charcoal trap and a flame arrester before
discharge into the cell ventilation duct. The gas should be free of air
or oxygen up to this point, since all purges are made with helium. A
sensitive pressure indicator will show any restriction in the off-gas line

or flame arrester.

3.3.6 NaF Absorbers

The absorbers for collecting UFg on NaF pellets are made of carbon
steel, which is sufficiently resistant to fluorine for the short exposures
involved. The absorbers will be used for processing only one batch and
will then be discarded to the burial ground. The absorbers are shown in
Fig. 3.10, and design data are given in Table 3.5. A bed depth of 6 to
10 in. (14 to 24 kg of NaF) will be used. The actual depth will depend
on the amount of uranium to be absorbed. With fuel salt C, three sets of
absorbers will be required, while with salt B only one set will be needed.

Each absorber is mounted in an open top container with an air dis-
tributor pipe in the bottom. Cooling air flows around the outside and up

through the open 2-in. center pipe. Air can be controlled separately to
each absorber.

Each absorber is provided with a thermowell immersed in the NaF pel-
lets near the gas inlet. Since absorption of UFg to form UFg 2NaF liber-
ates 23.9 kcal per mole, the start of UFg absorption and the breakthrough
to the succeeding absorber in the train can be followed by observing the
temperature rise.

The absorbers are connected with jumper lines having ring- joint
flanges with pigtails for local leak detection before sealing the cubicle.
The lines in the cubicle all have tubular heaters to prevent UF¢ conden-
sation. No spares are installed because the cubicle is accessible to the
high-bay area when processing is stopped.

3.3.7 Fluorine Disposal System

 

The excess fluorine is disposed of by reacting it with S05 to form
S0,F,, which is a relatively inert gas and can be safely passed through
the Fiberglas filters in the off-gas system. Design of the system is
based on the system in use at the Goodyear Atomic Corporation at Ports-
mouth, Ohio. Since the quantity of fluorine to be disposed of is similar,

the same size equipment is used, except for the fluorine preheater. The
fluorine at Portsmouth is diluted to about 10%, while the fluorination
off-gas will be nearly 100% fluorine toward the end of the processing.
The fluorine preheater can therefore be the same size as the SO, preheater.
Some construction details have been changed to adapt the equipment to re-
mote radioactive service,

The equipment is shown in Fig. 3.11, and design data for the system
are given in Table 3.6. Both gas streams are preheated to 400°F before
contacting in the fluorine reactor. Each preheater has three separate

heaters with installed spares. Each heater is controlled separately by
an off-on switch. The low-pressure steam coil on the inlet half of the
fluorine reactor supplies heat at the start to initiate the reaction and
acts as a coolant to remove the heat of reaction after the reaction begins.

It is desired to keep the ‘temperature below 1000°F to minimize corrosion.

3.3.8 Cubicle Exhauster

The air in the absorber cubicle is maintained at a 2-in. H50 negative
pressure with respect to the high-bay area by an exhauster located in the
fuel-processing cell. This is an exhauster with a capacity of 250 cfm at
10.5 in. H,0. It is driven by a 3/4-hp 3450-rpm 440-v 3-phase motor. The
suction side is connected to the cubicle by a 4-in. steel pipe routed
through the space west of the cell. The discharge is open to the cell
without any connecting piping. A 4-in. plug cock is provided in the suc-
tion line in the cubicle, with an access flange on the cubicle, to permit
closing the valve with the gasketed top in place for leak checking.

The blower is controlled by a manual switch with an interlock to a
solenoid valve in the cooling air supply to the absorbers. This ensures
that the cooling air cannot be turned on inadvertently with the blower

off and thereby pressurize the cubicle.

 

3.4 OQut-of-Cell Equipment

3.4.1 Activated-Charcoal Trap.

 

An activated-charcoal. trap is located in the off-gas line in the
spare cell. The main function of this trap is the removal of iodine from °

the off-gas stream. The trap consists of two 4 3/8- in. -diam, 10 1/2-1n. -

long canisters in series, each with a charcoal depth of 3/4. in. The
 cenisters are installed in a flanged 6-1in. Monel pipe so that they can be

replaced if necessary. _ Each canister contains 1. 5 1b of 6- 14 mesh char-
coal ‘and is rated to process air at a maximum of 25 £t7/min, “Each canister
has a: an’ ‘exposed surface of 1 £12, a The pressure drop. through. one canister

at 25 £t3/min is 0.15 in. HO.

 
 

 

 

42

3.4.2 Flame Arrester

Since the system will be completely purged of air before processing
begins and all purge and sparge gases will be helium or nitrogen, there
is no possibility of producing an explosive mixture with hydrogen in the
equipment. The only location involving an explosion hazard should be the
point of discharge of the off-gas into the off-gas duct. At this point
the maximum concentration of hydrogen in the air is 0.65% with a hydrogen
flow rate of 90 liters/min and a cell air exhaust of 500 cfm. This is
well below the lower explosive limit of hydrogen in air of 4%. The cell
exhaust flow rate will be checked at the time of processing to confirm
that there is sufficient detection.

As an added precaution, a flame arrester is installed in the off-gas
line between the activated-charcoal trap and the cell exhaust duct in the
spare cell with a union downstream for removal for cleaning or replacement.
The unit is a Varac model 51A and consists of copper gauze and disk lami-

nations.

3.4.3 0Off-Gas Filters

The fuel-processing cell ventilation air and the vessel off-gas will
pass through a 2-in.-deep 24- by 24-in. Fiberglas prefilter and a 11 1/2-
in. -deep 24- by 24-in. Fiberglas absolute filter before passing through
the main filters and containment stack. There are three 12-in.-diam but-
terfly valves for isolation and for bypassing of the filters for replace-
ment. A locally mounted differential-pressure transmitter indicates the
pressure drop across the filters on the fuel-processing system panel board.
~ The caustic scrubber off-gas, after passing through the charcoal trap and
the flame arrester, discharges into the duct just upstream of the bypass
tee. ’

This equipment is located in the spare cell with sufficient space al-
lowed for the addition of 2 ft of shielding (for a total of 3 1/2 ft) be-
tween the filters and the fuel-processing cell. This should be sufficient
shielding to permit filter changing with an irradiated fuel batch in the
storage tank. oo

3.4.4 HF Trap

The fluorine used will contain up to 5% HF, which could cause plugging
of the UF¢ (by formation of NaF-2HF, NaF-3HF, etc.) if not removed. There-
fore the trap shown in Fig. 3.12 and described in Table 3.7 is provided
in the fluorine line at the gas supply station.

Reference drawing D-FF-C-55443

 

The inlet of the trap is maintained at 212°F by steam to prevent
plugging (by prevention of the formation of the higher hydrogen fluoride
complexes) because of the high partial pressure of HF. Farther into the
NaF bed, the: HF partial pressure is lower and the higher complexes are
not formed: even at. the lower temperature. The. exit of the trap is water
cooled to. about 100°F, vhich is below the operating temperature of the UFg |

absorbers, and the trap. should therefore remove: any HF that could otherwise

collect in the absorbers. The reaction is exothermic and liberates 16.4

kcal per mole. of HF absorbed.
With a fluorine flow of 100 liters/min, a processing time of 10 hr,
and an HF content of 5%, the trap has sufficient capacity for the fluori-

‘nation of five batches if only 50% of the NaF is complexed to NaF: HF.

Since the average HF content is less than 5%, one loading should have

sufficient capacity for all the fluorinations planned at the MSRE. If

necessary, the NaF can be discarded and recharged.

3.4.5 HF Heater

The HF heater is installed in the gas line from the HF cylinder after
the flow control valve. The purpose of this heater is to dissociate the
HF gas to the monomolecular form for accurate flow metering. This requires
the addition of approximately 1.2 Btu/liter of gas or approximately 20
Btu/min at the maximum HF flow rate anticipated (17 liters/min). Another
1 Btu/min of sensible heat is required to heat the gas from 120°F, the
temperature of the gas at 25 psig leaving the cylinder, to 1§0°F, the
temperature required to reach the monomolecular form. This 21 Btu/min is
equivalent to 370 w. Two tubular heaters are used to provide a total of
1120 w. E |

The heater is strapped to the outside of a 2-in. Monel pipe about
22 in. long packed with nickel wool for heat transfer. The wool is con-
fined at the ends by 6 mesh Monel cloth. A thermowell is provided near
the outlet. .

3.4.6 Salt Sampler

The salt sampler in the fuel-processing system is mounted on the

roof plugs over the fuel-processing cell and is connected directly to the

top of the fuel storage tank by a vertical 1 1/2-in. pipe. The sampler
is the original fuel-pump ‘sampler-enricher mockup shown in Fig. 3.13. Tt
is the same as the fuel- ~pump ‘sampler, with the following exceptions:

1. Tt is designed for a maximum of 14 psig instead of 50 psig. Area
1C is protected from overpressure by a pressure relief valve that vents
to area 2B which is vented to the cell through the space around the 1 1/2-

in. sampling line,
2. No maintenance valve is required, since the system can be shut

down and purged if maintenance on the sampler is required.

3. Area 2B will contain ‘the vacuum pumps in addition to the opera-

tional valve.

4. A bellows is installed between the operational valve and the

sample line instead of between the valves and area 1C.

The sampler will not be used during processing. The fuel storage
tank will be purged with helium before the operational valve is opened
for sampling. The main purpose of the sampler is to verify that the salt
is satisfactory for return to the drain tank after processing. After
Ho-HF treatment the sample will be analyzed to determine that HF and FeFj
have been reduced to satisfactory levels. After fluorination the sample
will verify the complete removal of uranium. Also, sampling of flush salt
before processing will indicate the amount of fuel salt pickup.

The sampler will have, in general, the same instrumentation as the

fuel-pump sampler and will be operated in the same manner. >

3.5 Electrical System

Electrical power for the fuel-processing system is supplied by a
750-kva. 480/240-v transformer feeding a load center on the east side of
the remote maintenance practice cell on the 840-ft level. This 208-v
supply feeds two power panels, CP-A and CP-B, and starters for the two
motorized dampers for the fuel storage tank cooling air. The starter and
switch for the cubicle blower are located at the load center but have a
separate supply since the blower requires 440 v. Most of the equipment
and pipe heaters are controlled by switches or powerstats located at two
heater control panels, HCP-12 and HCP-13, at the south end of the heater
control ares on the 840-ft level east of the cell block. The pipe heaters
in the absorber cubicle are controlled by a switch at the cubicle in the
high-bay area. The line and equipment heaters are listed in Tables 3.8
and 3. 9. LT :

“The pipe line and equipment ‘heater, blower motor, and motorized

damper leads are routed from ‘the heater control panels through a junction

box on the west side of. ‘the. decontamination cell on the 840-11 level. At

this Junction box the spare heaters can be connected to the control panels

if necessary. Each control may have from one to nipe separate heaters,
which are connected as a group at the Junction box. Defective Heaters
can be replaced only by entering’ “the cell. After the ‘cell becomes radio-
active, only an entire group can be replaced unless the cell is decon-

taminated to permit direct maintenance.

3.6 Helium Supply System

 

The helium supply to the fuel-processing system is from the 40-psig
helium header in the water room. At the fuel-processing panelboard in the
high-bay area, this supply is reduced at a 20-psig transfer header and a
13.5-psig purge and sparge header. The transfer header has an alr-operated
block valve that cannot be opened unless freeze valve and drain tank vent
valve positions are correct to receive a salt batch from the fuel storage’
tank. The purpose of this interlock is to prevent accidental £i11ing of
the reactor or transfer to a tank already containing a salt batch.

The purge and sparge header has sufficient pressure (13.5 psig) to
permit sparging a salt batch at 100 liters/min but has insufficient pres-
sure to force salt over the loop in line 110 (14.6 psig, min). This
header is provided with a pressure-relief valve set at 14.0 psig, which
will reseal at 12.6 psig. Should this valve stick open or the helium
supply pressure be lost for any other reason, an interlock on the helium
purge flow to the system will close the Hp-HF-F, supply block valve, stop
the evolution of fission-product gases, and prevent the possible pres-
surizing of corrosive or radioactive gases up the sample line to the high-
bay area.

Other functions of the low-pressure header are to supply gas for
instrument- and sample-line purging, for purging the salt charging line
above the freeze valve prior to salt transfer, and for purging the HF and
Fz lines from the gas supply station to the fuel storage tank.

3.7 Instrumentation

3.7.1 Thermocouples

All the temperature-measuring points in the fuel-processing system
are listed in Table 3.10. Two 12-point recorders (0-250°F and 0-1000°F)
are installed on the fuel-processing system panelboard that will record
all measurements normally required for Hp-HF treatment. For fluorination,
additional low-temperature measurements are required, and the high-
temperature recorder and another low-temperature recorder temporarily
installed for this operation will be used.

3.7.2 Annunciators

The fuel-processing system annunciator points are listed in Table
3.11. There are 11 ennunciators on the chemical plant panelboard. In
addition there are 3 radiation alarms that indicate high gamma activity
in the charcoal absorbers, a high gamma activity in the instrument cubi-
cle, and a high gamma activity in the cell exhaust air. A portable alpha
air monitor will alarm on high air activity in the absorber cubicle and
there will be a high gamma level alarm on the fuel storage tank sampler
line.

3.8 Brine System

The siphon pot and cold trap are cooled by circulating freon brine
(trichloromonofluoromethane). The maximum cooling loads are approximately
2500 Btu/hr in the cold trap and an approximately 1200-Btu/hr heat loss
from the piping and equipment. - Al 1/2-hp water-cooled refrigeration
unit should provide sufficient capacity for brine temperatures as low as
—20°F. Brine is circulated by a canned-motor pump through insulated
3/4-1in. -0OD copper tubing. The refrigeration unit and circulating pump
are located on the 840-ft level vest of the cell.

4. SAFETY ANALYSIS
4.1 Summary and Conclusions

A decay period of at least four days should be allowed before trans-
fer of a fully irradiated fuel batch to the fuel storage tank to keep the
xenon level at maximum ground concentration below 2.5 mr/hr. Under normal
atmospheric conditions, this concentration would occur 325 meters from the
stack. It would decrease rapidly with distance and decay time, as indi-
cated in Table 4.1 and Fig. 4.1.

Since no irradiated salt has ever been treated with Hz-HF, the fis-~
sion-product volatilization to be expected is not known, but it should
be very low because of the reducing condition of the salt. Volatilization
of iodine and tellurium is the most likely, but reduction and plateout in
the gas phase and final adsorption by the activated-charcoal bed should
remove most of the volatilized activity. Much greater fission-product
volatilization is expected during fluorination, and longer decay times
will therefore be allowed before fluorinating flush or fuel salt.

The overall decontamination factors required to limit the release
of iodine to 50% of the ORNL weekly 1imit® of 1 curie are listed in Table
4.2, along with the decontamination factors for the other volatile ac~
tivities as determined by the maximum permissible concentration in air.
The only fission product of concern in processing with a short decay
time would be iodine.

Accidental releases were also considered, and it was found that they
would not result in excessive exposures, since the processing operation
could be shut down rapidly upon indication of excessive activity in the

off-gas stream.

4.2.2 Air Contamination

Exposures from gaseous activity are to be limited to 10% of the MPC
for a 40-hr week. All activity emissions will be averaged for a quarter,
although processing will require less than two weeks, because irradiated

fuel will be processed less frequently than once per quarter.

4.2.3 Activity in Salt

The amounts of volatile activity to be expected in a fuel salt batch
irradiated for one full-power year are listed in Table 4.3 for various
decay times. When processing flush salt containing irradiated fuel salt,
the required decontamination factor will be smaller by the ratio of flush

to fuel salt, as determined from a salt sample.

4.3 Q@aseous Activity

4.3.1 Activity Release from the Containment Stack

4.3.1.1 Activity Released When Not Processing. A fully irradiated
fuel batch will be held in the fuel drain tank, with the off-gas passed
to a charcoal bed, until the xenon emission cannot cause a radiation

level in excess of 2.5 mr/hr at the point of maximum ground concentration.

. From Fig. 4.1 it can be seen that an approximately four-day decay period

is required before transfer to the fuel storage tank, which is not vented
through a charcoal bed. Since there is about 50 ft3 of gas space in the
processing equipment and the purge rate will be low when not processing,
there probably will be no xenon emission from the stack until processing
actually begins. Because of the very short half life of 85Br, 85Kr emis-

sion will be below the MPC 30 min after reactor shutdown.

4.3.1.2 Activity Released During Hp-HF Treatment. Although there
has been no work done on fission-product ‘behavior under the highly re-
ducing conditions of the Hz-HF treatment, very little if any fission-
product volatilization is expected. All the fission products that could

form volatile fluorides are more noble than the structural metals chromium,
iron, and nickel. Nickel, which is the most noble of the structural metals
will be limited to less than 1 ppm as NiF, with a 10:1 Hp-to-HF ratio.
Therefore, although no equilibrium quotients are available for the fission-
product fluorides, it is unlikely that any niobium, ruthenium, antimony,
tellurium, or iodine will exist in the salt as the fluoride. However, it
is possible that HzTe and HI could form and become volatile. The activated
charcoal trap should provide good decontamination from these activities.

The first treatment of salt containing fission products will be a
treatment of flush salt containing some irradiated fuel salt. This treat-
ment should provide the information needed for deciding on the required .
decay time for safe processing of a fully irradiated fuel batch. The ac-
tivity release will be followed both by gas sampling and by radiation
monitoring of the off-gas stream. oo

4.3.1.3 Activity Released During Fluorination. ©Since considerable

 

volatilization of fission products is to be expected under the oxidizing
conditions of fluorination, the maximum possible decay time should be
allowed before processing. Based on Chemical Technology Division fluori-
nation experience, decontamination factors of 1 for iodine (complete vola-
tilization), 1 to 10 for tellurium, and 10 to 10° for niobium, ruthenium,
and antimony can be expected. From Table 4.2 it can be seen that the only
fission product that requires much additional decontamination is iodine,
and this should be obtained in the activated-charcoal trap. Additional
decontamination from most fission products will be obtained by plateout in
both the reactor and the fuel-processing system by the 750°F NaF trap, by
the caustic scrubber, and by the filters.

Total release of the 114 curies of iodine present in the fuel after
90 days of decay, while considerably in excess of the 1 curie/week maximum
release as determined by the grass-cow-milk-human chain, would result in
an exposure of only 0.3 rem in 8 hr at the point of maximum ground con-
centration. This is only 3% of the permissible exposure due to accidental
or unusual releases.

4.3.1.4 Activity Released by Equipment Failure. Two possible ac-

 

cidents were considered. The first is the simultaneous rupture of the

"

63

fuel storage tank and the caustic scrubber, which would result in vapori-
zation of the caustic solution and thereby pressurization of the cell.
The second is a gas-space rupture during fluorination.

The simultaneous rupture of both the fuel storage tank and the caustic
scrubber and contact of the two volumes could cause a rapid buildup of the
cell pressure to approximately 100 psig by vaporizing the 1600 liters of
caustic solution and releasing the associated activity to the building and
up the stack. Contact is prevented by an 18-in.-high dam that divides the
cell. The dam is sealed to the floor and to the north and south walls.

The sump is on the aqueous side of the dam, and water lines routed over
the salt side are provided with containment lines that drain to the aqueous
side.

If there should be a rupture in the gas space of the fuel storage
tank or in the off-gas piping or equipment upstream of the caustic scrubber,
the most serious release would occur during fluorination when fission-
product volatilization is expected to be greater and processing times
shorter than during the Hp-HF treatment. If the activity is evolved uni-
formly over a 10-hr period, 2% of the activity will be in the gas space
at any one time. If shutdown requires 6 min, another 1% would be evolved
for a total of 3%. Assuming 90 days decay and complete volatilization of

tellurium, the exposure at the point of maximum ground concentration would

~ be less than 3% of the permissible quarterly exposure. Ruthenium and

niobium releases would be of the same order if the releases occurred up-
stream of the NaF trap (because of lower volatilization) and would be
much lower downstream of the NaF trap, which will provide considerable
decontamination for these activities. ' These exposures. are conservative,

since much of the activity would plate out or be removed by the filters.

The leak would be detected by both cell air monitors and fluoride ion

monitors, and it seems reasonsble that fluorine flow could be stopped

. within 6 min.

The causes of an equipment failure that have been considered are

corrosion and criticality. Although corrosion rates as high as 0.5.

mil/hr during fluorination are expected, the fluorination time will be

short and processing will be infrequent, so the total corrosion will be
small. Also, corrosion would probably not result in a complete rupture.

 
 

 

on

A criticality incident is conceivable only if there is a large break-
through of UFg to the caustic scrubber. The NaF trap and the absorbers
are critically safe without internal moderation because of the maximum
capacity of 0.9 g of uranium per gram of NaF. Fluorination will be stopped
when uranium starts to load the final absorber, which will serve as a trap
to retain any traces of uranium passing the other absorbers. Since absorp-
tion will be very rapid and complete, there will be no possibility of
breakthrough of more than 1 or 2 g of uranium. Loading of the final ab-
sorber will be detectable by temperature rise. The fuel storage tank off-
gas stream will pass directly from the NaF trap to the caustic scrubber
during Hp-HF treatment when no uranium is being volatilized. This will
require two physical changes in the piping to bypass the absorber train
and connect the gas supply line to HF instead of Fj. Administrative con-
trol of these piping changes will guarantee that fluorine cannot be used -
when the absorbers are not in the system.

4.3.2 Activity Release to the Operating Area

The high-bay area above the fuel-processing cell will be used for
operation of the fuel-processing system. The possible release of gaseous
activity into this area during fuel processing through the roof plugs,
from the absorber cubicle, from the salt sampler, and from lines penetrat-
ing the cell walls was considered. As in Section 4.3.1, the most serious
release would be the release of tellurium during fluorination.

4.3.2.1 Activity Released Through the Roof Plugs. Leakage of ac-
tivity from the fuel-processing cell to the operating area is not con-
sidered credible for the following reasons: .

1. The cell is tightly sealed. All penetrations, piping, and wiring
are grouted and sealed with mastic or pass through sealed boxes. The roof
| plugs are gasketed at the bearing surfaces, and the joints are caulked.

2. A negative pressure of 1 in. of water will be maintained during
processing. This pressure should be easily attainable considering the
size and tightness of the cell. Air inleakage should be less than 500
£3 /min by comparison with a Volatility Pilot Plant cell 50% larger and
having considerably more penetrations and maintaining ea 2-in. negative

"

"

 
 

»

65

pressure with 300 to 500 £43 /min inleakage. The nominal exhaust from.
the processing cell will be 500 ft2/min, with 50 to 100 ft/min of air
entering the cell from the absorber cubicle during fluorination.

© 3. Processing can be quickly stopped. This would be done auto-
matically in case of a power failure, which would close the shutoff
valve on the gas supply (Fa, | HF, and Hp). The power failure would also
stop the flow of cooling air to the cubicle. This air exhausts to the
cell and is the only positive gas flow to the cell. A loss of ventila-
tion not caused by a general power failure is highly improbable since
there is a spare stack fan and the fans can be run with diesel power.
If the cell should lose its negative pressure, an alarm would sound and
processing could be quickly suspended at the instrument panel board by
shutting off the main helium purge, which automatically closes the gas

supply shutoff valve, and closing the cooling air valve to the absorbers.

4,3.2.2 Activity Released from the Absorber Cubicle. The absorber
cubicle is a sealed box of 3/16-in.-thick steel located near the instru-
ment panel board in the high-bay area. It is located in the high-bay -
area to facilitate handling of the portable ‘absorbers following fluorina-
tion. By means of the cubicle blower, the cubicle will be maintained at
a negative pressure with respect to the cell, which will be negative to
the high-bay area. Failure of power to the blower will close the solenoid
valve in the air supply to the cubicle to avoid pressurization.

The maximum cubicle pressure with 100-f£t3/min air flow will be checked

to demonstrate that a pressure greater than 1 psig cannot be obtained with

the blower off. If necessary the. maximum air flow will be reduced below

- 100 2% /min to prevent exceeding 1 psig. Prior to fluorination the vent

valve will be closed, the cubicle pressure will be. raised to 1 psig, and
the leak rate will be determined. Leakage must be less’ than 1%/br (220
ce/min). This rate of tellurium leakage would allow ‘14 min of working
time in the high-bay area without masks. This is sufficient time to shut

“down and to evacuate the high-bay area, since the reactor will not be op-

erating during fuel processing.
The presence of gaseous: activity in the ‘absorber cubicle will be de-

tected by a monitor that will be continuously sampling the cubicle air

during processing. If a leak occurs, processing can be suspended. The

 
 

 

 

66

cubicle will then be purged with air to the cell, the cubicle top will be
removed, and all joints will be checked for tightness. Smears from each
joint should indicate the location of the leak.

4.3.2.3 Activity Released from the Cell Penetrations. All cell
penetrations connected directly to process equipment are provided with
check valves, most of which are located in a sealed instrument cubicle
along with the instrument transmitters. A backup of activity to the
check valves would be detected by a radiation monitor in the cubicle and
possibly by the area monitors in the high-bay area.

In addition to the lines routed through the instrument cubicle,
there are three other penetrations from the cell to the high-bay area:
the salt sampler, which is discussed in the next section, the salt-
charging line, and the caustic-charging line. The salt-charging line
will be sealed with at least one freeze valve and capped when not charg-
ing salt. The caustic-charging line to the caustic scrubber is provided
with a check valve and a manual valve. Caustic will not be charged dur-
ing processing, which would be the only time that pressure or activity
could be found in the charging line.

The waste-salt line to the spare cell will be sealed by a freeze
valve in the processing cell. The method of waste-salt disposal has not
yet been determined.

4.3.2.4 Activity Released from the Salt Sampler. The fuel-process-

ing system sampler, as mentioned in Section 3.4.6, is similar to the fuel-

pump sampler-enricher. Both samplers have similar instrumentation and
will be used with similar operating procedures. The fuel-storage tank
will not be sampled during processing. Before sampling, the sampling
line and fuel storage tank will be purged of gaseous activity. The sam-
ple capsule containing the solid sample will be moved from the primary
containment area IC (see Fig. 3.13) to a secondary containment area 3A,
~ where the sample will be sealed inside a transport container tube before

being removed from the sampler to a shielded carrier.

4.4 Penetrating Radiation

bob. 1 Normal Levels

4.4.1.1 Operating Area. The radiation level in the high-bay area
over the fuel-processing cell will be less than 10 nr /hr- through the 4-
ft-thick high-density-concrete roof plugs under the most severe conditions
with a fully irradiated, four-day-decayed fuel salt batch in the fuel
storage tank. Since processing would not be started until the batch had
decayed for at least a few weeks, this level above the cell should cause
no concern. Operations will be planned to limit exposure of individuals
to less than 100 mr/week, and signs will be posted indicating radiation
levels at various points in the high-bay area.

The salt sampler will be shielded with 4 in. of lead, which should
reduce the radiation level from a fuel salt sample to less than 10 mr/hr.

It will probably be necessary to shield the absorber cubicle during
processing of a fully irradiated fuel batch. As mentioned in Section
2.2.4, the maximum radiation level expected at the surface of each ab-
sorber is less than 100 mr/hr. ~ In addition there will be some activity
plated out on the piping and some gaseous activity in the lines and gas
space during processing. The radiation levels will be monitored during
processing, shielding will be added, and radiation signs will be posted
as required, . Permanent shielding will not be installed, since it should
not be required during the more frequent Hp-HF treatment.

4.4.1.2 Switch House. The only fuel-processing cell wall adjacent

to an occupied ares is the west wall bordering the switch house. The 4-

ft area between the switch: house and the cell will be filled with stacked

concrete blocks. When a fully irradiated fuel batch is in the storage

tank, the level at the east wall of the switch house should be less than

“4.4.1.3 Spare Cell. The east wall of the fuel-processing cell ad-

joins the spare cell where the activated-charcoal trap, off-gas filters,

“dampers, differential-pressure ‘transmitter, and hydrogen flame arrester

are located. A blanked waste salt line extends into: this cell for future

removal of waste salt. Two feet of space is provided between the cell

 
 

 

 

 

68

wall and the gbove equipment for the installation of shielding blocks.
This space will provide for sufficient shielding (a total of 3 1/2 ft)
to permit replacing the off-gas filters without exceeding planned expo-
sures. The dose rate should be less than 50 mr/hr.

4.4.1.4 Decontamination Cell. The 18-in. north wall of the fuel-
processing cell borders the decontamination cell. Depending on the water
level, there will probably be a limited working time over the decontamina-
tion cell with the roof plugs off and a fully irradiated batch in the fuel
storage tank.

4.4.1.5 Area Surrounding the Waste Cell. The maximum activity ex-
pected in the caustic solution from the fluorination of a 90-day-decayed
fuel batch is 1300 curies of tellurium, assuming 10% removal in the scrub-
ber. During the time this activity is in the liquid waste tank, there
must be limited access to the areas above and around the waste cell, and

 

radiation warning signs must be posted.

4.4.2 Unusual Radiation Levels

4.4.2.1 Trom Irradiated Salt. There are two dip tubes in the fuel
storage tank into which salt could accidentally back up: the salt trans-
fer line and the gas-sparging line. The salt transfer line is connected
to the spare cell by the waste salt line and to the high-bay area by the
salt-charging line. Both lines have freeze valves that are normally
frozen. In addition, the end of each line will be capped when not in use.

The gas-sparging line passes through the area west of the cell to
the instrument cubicle and then to the gas supply station. An air valve
located in the instrument cubicle opens if the tank pressure exceeds the
purge pressure and vents the line to the top of the tank to prevent salt
backup. If a plug should occur, it could be thawed with installed elec-
tric heaters without entering the cell.

4.4.2.2 From Caustic Solution. The greatest activity expected in

the caustic scrubber tank is from tellurium. Under the reducing condi-
tions of the H-HF treatment, very little of the tellurium should reach
the scrubber. During fluorination most of the tellurium will probably
volatilize, but less than 10% is expected to collect in the caustic

69

solution. In Volatility Pilot Plant run R-7, only 8% of the tellurium

was found in the scrubber, which is a much more efficient unit than the

- MSRE unit, which is designed primarily for the neutralization of HF.

If all the tellurium in a fully irradiated fuel salt batch allowed to
decay for 90. days were evolved during the first 8 hr. of fluorination
(first batch of caustic solution), and 10% were removed in the scrubber,
1300 curies would be collected in about 350 gal of liquid. This is 3.7
curies/gal and could be sent to the intermediate level waste tanks at
the Central Collection Station without dilution after being jetted to
the MSRE liquid waste tank.

The solution could possibly get into unshielded lines in the follow-
ing ways:

1. Pressuring of the scrubber tank during processing and plugging
of the vent line or flame arrester could force liquid up the jet suction
line to the waste tank, which is the normal disposal route for caustic
solution and would create no hazard. Some solution might back up the jet
steam line, but this line is shielded to approximately 25 ft from the jet
and backup this far into a closed line is unlikely with an open line to
the waste tank. The pressure alarms on both the fuel storage tank and
the caustic scrubber would provide sufficient warning to stop processing
before a dangerous pressure was reached.

2. Pressuring of the scrubber tank during jetting plus plugging of
the vent line or flame arrester and plugging of the jet discharge line
to the waste tank could cause steam to back up through the caustic solu-
tion. Considerable time would be required to build up sufficient pres-
sure (7 psig) to force solution up the sparge line to the absorber cubicle.

Pressure alarms and radiation monitors would provide warning far in ad-

vance of any hazard.

3. A vacuum in the jet line could pull solution into the steam line.
If the jet discharge line should plug and jetting should stop, condensing
steam could create such a vacuum. ‘A check valve tees into the steam line
and will prevent a vacuum from forming in this line. This check valve is
vented to the cell ventilation system.

4. Cooling of the fuel storage tank without gas purges to the tank
could cause a vacuum in the tank and off-gas piping to the scrubber. A

 
 

 

 

 

70

power failure could cause cooling of the tank but would not stop the he-
lium purges. In the event of a prolonged power failure and cooling of
the fuel storage tank, the caustic scrubber would be jetted to the waste
tank. :
4.4.2.3 From Radioactive Gas. The sampling line is the only gas

 

line from the fuel storage tank to the operating area. Steps will be

taken as indicated in Section 4.3.2.4 to keep gaseous activity out of

the sampler. Sparging for 1 hr with helium should reduce. the activity
in the gas space by a factor of 10°. Complete filling of the sampler

access chamber with atmosphere from the fuel storage tank would result
in a radiation level 10° times less than that from a fully irradiated

fuel salt sample.

Fluorine breakthrough is detected by a temperature rise in

the fluorine reactor. At this time, do the following:

a. Reduce fluorine flow rate to 50 liters/min.

b. Start helium flow to FST by opening V 607A and adjust-
ing V 607B to 50 liters/min.

c. Turn steam to fluorine reactor on full. Reduce pre-
heater temperatures slightly if necessary to keep re-
actor temperature below 1000°F.

Follow UFg absorption by absorber temperatures. As absorp-

tion starts in second absorber, turn air on the second ab-

‘sorber and off the first absorber. Continue in this manner

until there is no heat of reaction in the absorbers. If

fuel containing low-enrichment uranium or thorium is being

processed, five absorbers will not have sufficient capacity
for all the uranium, and fluorination will have to be sus-

pended to install new absorbers. When processing salt B

‘this will not be necessary and steps (12) to (18) can be

eliminated.
When the temperature starts to increase in the last absorber,

stop the fluorine flow by closing PCV 690.

Adjust V 607B to 100 liters/min helium sparge for 1 hr.

Prepare system to resume fluorination (see Sect. 5.2.3).
Certain of these steps, such as transfer of salt, will not
be necessary. CL

Resume fluorination (see Sects. 5.2.5.1 and 5.2.5.2).
When there is no more indication of absorber heating, stop
the fluorine flow by closing PCV 690.

Turn off SO, flow by closing V 698A.

Sample Salt. Since a fluorine trailer will only last 2 hr

at 100 liters/min, it will be necessary to stop fluorination before all
the UFg is volatilized. The salt will be sampled every 2 hr while the
trailer is being changed to check on the progress of fluorination. At

alternate trailer changes (every 4 hr), it will be necessary to jet the

caustic solution to the waste tank and charge fresh caustic.

Close PCV 690.

Close V 690A and V 690B.

Adjust V 607B to 100 liters/min helium sparge for 1 hr.
Close V 607B and sample salt (see Section 6A of MSRE op-
erating procedures¥).

top half and top of the FST to 900°F and fluorinate for
an additional 30 min.

Stop fluorine flow and repeat helium sparge for 1 hr and
resample.

If sample shows less than 15 ppm uranium, the fluorination
is complete.

Check sample for free fluorine. Continue helium sparge

until below limit of detection.
