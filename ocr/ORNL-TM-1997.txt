AN EVALUATION OF THE MOLTEN SALT REACTOR EXPERIMENT
HASTELIOY N SURVEILLANCE SPECIMENS — FIRST GROUP

H. "BE. McCoy, Jr.

ABSTRACT

, We have tested the first group of surveillance specimens
from the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment core. They were
removed after 7823 Mwhr of reactor operation during which
the specimens were held at 645 + 10°C for 4800 hr and
accumulated a thermal dose of 1.3 X 102° neutrons/cm?.

The high-temperature ductility was reduced, but the reduction
was similar to that observed for these materials when
irradiated in the Osk Ridge Reactor in a helium environment.
The low-temperature ductility was reduced, and this is
thought to be due to the formation of intergranular MgC.

The specimens showed no evidence of corrosion; however, a .
carbon-rich layer, 1 to 2 mils in depth, was noted where

the Hastelloy N and graphite were in contact. Thé mechanical
properties of the Hastelloy N appear adequate for the
continued satisfactory operation of the MSRE.

a)

Test results are presented for the effects of several
variables on the tensile ductility of irradiated and
unirradiated Hastelloy N. These variables included test
temperature, strain rate, and prestraining.

 

INTRODUCTION

The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment is a single region reactor that
is fueled by a molten fluoride salt (65 LiF, 29.1 BeF,, 5 ZrFy,
0.9 UF; mole %), moderated by unclad graphite, and contained by Hastelloy N
(Ni—16 Mo—7 Cr—4 Fe—0.05 C, wt %). The details of the reactor design and
construction cen be found elsewhere.l We knew that the neutron environment
would produce some changes in the ‘two structural materiels - graphite and
Hastelloy N. Although we were very confident of the compatibility of these

- materials with the fluoride salt, we needed to keep abreast of the possible
development of corrosion problems within the reactor itself. For these
reasons, we developed a surveillance program that would allow us to follow
the property changes of graphite and Hastelloy N specimens as the reactor
operated. ) |

The reactor went critical on June 1, 1965, and after numerous
small problems were solved, assumed normal operation on May 1966. The
present group of surveillance specimens was in the reactor from
September 8, 1965, to July 28, 1966, and was removed after 7823 Mwhr of
operation (designated "first group"). This report covers the tests that

were run on the Hastelloy N specimens that were removed.
EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

Surveillance Assembly

The core surveillance assembly was designed by W. H. Cook and others,

and the details have been reported previously. ? The facility is shown
pictorially and schematically in Fig. 1. The specimens are arranged in
three stringers. Each stringer is about 62 in. long and consists of two
Hastelloy N rods and a graphite section made up of various pieces that are
joined by pinning and tongue-and-groove Joints. The Hastelloy N rod has
periodic reduced sections 1 1/8 in. long X 1/8 in. in diameter and can be
cut into small tensile specimens after it is removed from the reactor.
Three stringers are joined together so that they can be separated in a hot
cell and reassembled with one or more new stringers for reinsertion into
the reactor. The assembled stringers fit into a perforated Hastelloy N
basket that is inserted into an axial position about 3.6 in. from the core

center line.

When the basket was removed on July 28, 1966, some of the specimens
were bent and the entire assembly had to be replaced.’ Slight modifications
‘in the design were made, and the assembly was removed recently and found
to be in excellent condition.%

A control facility is associated with the surveillance program. It
utilizes a "puel salt” containing depleted uranium in a static pot that is
heated electrically. The temperature is controlled by the MSRE computer so
that the temperature matches that of the reactor. Thus, these specimens
are exposed to conditions the same as those in the reactor except for the
static salt and the absence of a neutron flux.

There is another surveillance facility for Hastelloy N located outside
the core in a vertical position about 4.5 in. from the vessel. These
specimens are exposed to the cell environment (Np + 2-5% 02). They were

not ‘removed during the first group.

Materials

Two heats of Hastelloy N were used in this program: heats 5081 and
5085. Both of these heats were air-melted by Stellite Division of Union
Carbide Corporation, and their chemical analyses are given in Table 1.
Heat 5085 was used for making the cylindrical portion of the core vessel,

and heat 5081 was used for various parts inside the reactor.

Test Specimens

The specimens were put into the reactor as rods 62 in. long by
1/4 in. in diameter with reduced sections 1/8 in. in diameter by
1 1/8 in. long. The long rod was made in seven pieces and welded together
to obtain the 62-in.-long rod. After removal from the reactor, the rod
was sawed into small specimens with a gage section 1 1/8 in. long by
1/8 in. in diameter. Each rod is designated by a letter and the individual

specimens are numbered beginning at the bottom of the rod and increasing
to 27 at the top.

The rods in the first group were bent, and it was necessary to examine
each specimen with an optical comparator to determine whether it was
suitable for use. If the total indicated runout of the gage section was
greater than 0.002 in., the specimen was not used. The best specimens
were used for the higher temperature tests where the expected strains were
smallest. The results from a brittle material are affected more seriously
by specimen alignment than are those from a ductile material.

The materials were received in the mill annealed condition (1 -hr at
1177°C). They were given a further anneal of 2 hr at 900°C prior to

insertion into the reactor and the control facility.

Trradiation Conditions

The specimens from the first group were in the reactor from
September 8, 1965, to July 28, 1966. The reactor had operated 0.0066 Mwhr
when the specimens were inserted and 7823 Mwhr when they were removed.
They were at temperature for 4800 hr with the temperature range being
645 + 10°C. However, the material was only exposed to salt for 2796 hr,
The flux was measured by H. B. Piper’ using stainless steel wires that
were attached to the surveillance specimens. The thermal and fast flux
profiles are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 along with the axial location of each
specimen. The peak thermal dose, based on the 5900(n, 7) $°Co transmutation,
was 1.3 X 102° peutrons/cm?® and the fast dose (>1.22 Mev), based on the
58Ni (n,p)>8Co transmutation, was 3 X 10° neutrons/cm?. The cross section
used for the >°Co(n,7)%%Co transmutation was 22.25 barns, and that for
“the 98Ni(n,p)?%Co transmutation was 0.1262 barns.

“Testing Techniques

The laboratory creep-rupture tests were run in conventional creep
machines of the dead load and lever arm types. The strain was measured by
a dial indicator that showed the total movement of the specimen and part
of the load train. The zero strain measurement was taken immediately after
the load was applied. The temperature accuracy was 0.75%, the guaranteed
accuracy of the Chromel-P-Alumel thermocouples used.

The postirradiation creep-rupture tests were run in lever arm machines
that were located in hot cells. The strain was measured by an extensometer
with rods attached to the upper and lower specimen grips. The relative
movement of these two rods was measured by a linear differential trans-
former, and the transformer signal was recorded. The accuracy of the strain
measurements is difficult to determine. The extensometer (mechanical and
electrical portions) produced measurements that could be read to about
+0.02% strain; however, other factors (temperature changes in the cell,
mechanical vibrations, ete.) probably combined to give an overall accuracy
of $0,1% strain. This is considerably better than the specimen-to-specimen
reproducibility that one would expect for relatively brittle materials.
The temperature measuring and control system was the same as that used in
the laboratory with only one exception. In the laboratory, the control
system was stabilized at the desired temperature by use of a recorder with
an expanded scale. In the tests in the hot cells, the control point was
established by setting the controller without the aid of the expanded-scale
recorder. This error and the thermocouple accuracy combine to give a
temperature uncertainty of about 1%.

The tensile tests were run on Instron Universal Testing Machines. The
strain measurements were teken from the crosshead travel.

The test environment was air in all cases. Metallographic examination
showed that the depth of oxidation was small (<0.002 in.), and hence we
feel that the environment did not appreciably influence the test results.

Test Results

Since the surveillance assembly was bent, it was necessary to remove
all the specimens in the first group, end we had about 50 specimens of
each heat after the bent ones were discarded. Thus, we had enough specimens
to run the desired tests for surveillance purposes and enough to lock at
some further variables that are of value in understanding the behavior of -
irradiated Hastelloy N. We shall present all the results that were obtained
even though much of this information has little direct bearing on the safe
operation of the MSRE. Since the rupture ductility is of primary impor-
tance, we shall be most concerned with this property.

‘The results of tensile tests on the control specimens of heat 5081
are given in Table 2. The total elongations at fracture as a function of

This material exhibits the ductility minimum that is characteristic of
nickel-base alloys. The temperature of the minimum ductility seems to
decrease with decreasing strain rate. Several of the specimens were run
at various strain rates over the range of 2 to 0.002 min~t. The results
of these tests are also given in Table. 2, and the fracture elongations are
given in Fig. 5. The fracture elongation is very sensitive to strain rate
at 650°C, but relatively insensitive at higher and lower temperatures.

The results of the tests on the surveillance specimens from heat 5081
are summarized in Table 3, The elongation at fracture is plotted as a
function of temperature in Fig. 6. The irradiated material is characterized
by a sharp drop in ductility with increasing temperature above about 500°C.
The ductility continues to decrease with increasing temperature rather than
exhibiting a ductility minimum like the unirradiated material (Fig. 4).
The ductility is lower at a strain rate of 0.002 min~! than at 0.05 min~?%,
but the difference decreases with increasing temperature. This point is
demonstrated quite well in Fig. 7 where the dependence of the ductility on -
strain rate is shown for several temperatures. oo

We have locked individuslly at the properties of the surveillance and
control specimens of heat 5081; let us now compare these properties. The
ratios of the property for the irradiated material to that of the

unirradiated material are compared in Fig. 8 as a function of temperature.

Fig. 8. Comparative Tensile Properties of Irradiated and Unirradiated

MSRE Surveillance Specimens, Heat 5081.

The yield stress is unaffected by irradiation. The ultimate stress is
reduced approximately 8% up to about 600°C where the reduction becomes
greater with increasing temperature.

The total elongation at fracture for the irradiated material is lower

by about 30% at room temperature, but recovers to be almost equivalent at

400°C. As the temperature is increased above 400°C, the ductility of the °

irradiated material drops to where it is only about 4% of that of the
unirradiated specimens. The strain rate versus temperature data are
treated in a similar way in Fig. 9. At 400°C the surveillance and control
specimens have about the same ductility with only a slight decrease in the
ratio with decreasing strain rate. At 500°C there is a sharp drop in the

ratio at a strain rate of about 0.05 min~?.

This sharp change in strain

rate sensitivity is probably due to the transition from transgranular to

intergranular fracture. The ratio is a bit confusing at 650°C; its rise

with decreasing strain rate is due to the fact that the ductility of the

control specimens decreases more rapidly with decreasing strain rate than
that of the surveillance specimens. At 760 and 850°C the ratio becomes

quite small and its dependence on strain rate becomes less.

Fig. 9. Comparative Ductilities of MSRE Surveillance Specimens as a
Function of Strain Rate, Heat 5081. . :

The results of the tensile tests on the control specimens of heat 5085
are given in Table 4. The total elongation at fracture is plotted in
Fig. 10 as a. function of the test temperature. The characteristic ductility
minimum is obtained, but the temperature of the minimum ductility does not
appear to be sensitive to strain rate.

The results of the tensile tests on the surveillance specimens from
heat 5085 are given in Table 5. The fracture elongation is plotted. as a
function of test temperature in Fig. 11. The ductility drops precipitously
above 500°C with the elongation being lower at the lower strain rate.

The ratio of the irradiated property to that of the unirradiated
property for heat 5085 is shown in Fig. 12 as a function of temperature.
The yield and ultimate stresses of this heat are influenced about the same

by irradiation as those of heat 5081 (Fig. 8). The elongation at low

temperatures is not reduced as much by irradiation, but it does not recover

as the test ‘temperature is increased.’

The elongations at failure for the two heats of material are compared

in Figs. 13 and 14. At a strain rate of 0.05 min~?t (Fig. 13) there are
several minor variations in the ductilities of the control specimens. The
main difference is that the ductility of heat 5085 is consistently lower
up to about 500°C. Both heats of the surveillance specimens exhibit a
reduction in ductility at a test temperature of 25°C; however, the
reduction is greater for heat 5085. The ductility of heat 5081 recovers
some with increasing test temperature, but heat 5085 maintains its reduced
ductility. Above about 500°C the ductility of the controls drops rapidly,
but the ductility of the irradiated surveillance specimens decreases more
rapidly. Both heats have very similar ductilities at temperatures above
600°C. The ductilities of the two heats at a strain rate of 0.002 min?!
are compared in Fig. 14. The control specimens of both heats exhibited
very similar ductilities, the characteristic ductility minimum being

exhibited. The irradiated surveillance specimens have much lower

ductilities, but the values are very similar for the two heats.

We took a brief look at how the tensile properties of the material
varied as a function of heat treatment in the unirradiated state. The
properties of heat 5081 in several metallurgical conditions are given in
Table 6. The anneal for 2 hr at 900°C generally decreased the strength
and increased the rupture strain over that of the as-received material.
One exception to this behavior is an increase in ultimate stress at 650°C
due to the 2 hr anneal at 900°C. The exposure to molten salt at 650°C
for 4800 hr caused a decrease in the ductility and slight variations in
the strength. The tensile properties of heat 5085 in the unirradiated

condition are given in Table 7. The properties of this heat are not

. significantly different in the as-received condition and after annealing

2 hr at 900°C. The exposure to molten salt at 650°C caused a general

decrease of 10 to 20% in the rupture ductility, but the strength was not
affected significantly.

The postirradiation tensile properties of several heats of MSRE
material are compared in Table 8. The first two sets of data for

heat 5065 show that the postirradiation properties were not affected by

whether the material was irradiated in the as-received condition or
whether it was annealed 8 hr at 871°C. These specimens were irradiated at
43°C, and the ductilities at 25°C (0.05 min~') and 650°C (0.002 min~') were
34 to 36 and 13 to 14%, respectively. When irradiated at an elevated
temperature, this same heat had elongations at 650°C (0.002 min~?') of

6.5 and 6.1%. Heats 5067 and 5085 'showed somewhat better ductilities at
650°C (0.002 min=%) with values of 9 to 10% being obtained for irradiations
at elevated temperatures. The ductilities of the two surveillance heats

at 650°C agree closely with those observed previously for heats 5085

and 5067. However, the room temperature ductilities are lower than those
observed for any heat of material irradiated at an elevated temperature.
Heat 5081 was included in another experiment in the Osk Ridge Research
Reactor, © and the results are compared with those for the MSRE surveillance
specimens in Fig. 15. These results indicate that the properties of the

material are unaffected by the salt environment.

We also ran several creep-rupture tests on the irradiated materials
to evaluate their properties under creep conditions. For comparison, the
results of several creep-rupture tests on unirradiated heat 5081 are given
in Table 9. Of the two heat treatments investigated, 2 hr at 900°C and
the surveillance control treatment, the latter resulted in slightly lower
rupture strains. The creep-rupture data are plotted in Fig. 16, and the
* MSRE surveillance control specimens exhibit a slightly reduced rupture
life. However, the minimum creep rate is the same after the two heat
treatments (Fig. 17).

The creep-rupture properties of heat 5085 were investigated in three
conditions — as-received, annealed 2 hr at 900°C, and 2 hr at 900°C plus
4800 hr in molten salt (Table 10). The rupture strain of the as-received
material is improved by annealing at 900°C, but the long aging treatment
at 650°C brings about a slight reduction in the fracture ductility.

Figure 18 compares the rupture life after the various heat treatments.

The pattern is the same as that for the ductility with the minimum strength
being observed for the as-received material and the maximum for the material
annealed 2 hr at 900°C. However, the minimum creep rate was unaffected by
heat treatment (Fig. 19).

The results of the tests on the surveillance specimens are given
in Table 11. The properties (ductility and strength) of heat 5081 are
superior to those of heat 5085. However, a comparison of these data with
those for the control specimens in Tables 9 and 10 shows that irradiation
has significantly reduced the rupture life and ductility of both heats.
The rupture lives are compared in Fig. 20 for both heats of material in
the irradiated and unirradiated conditions. The effect of irradiation is
greater as the stress level increases. The minimm creep rates of the
two heats of material in the irradiated and unirradiated conditions are
compared in Pig. 21. This parameter appears to be independent of the
varisbles being studied with the possible exception of the irradiated
specimens exhibiting a higher strain rate at the 47,000-psi stress level.

The results of the creep-rupture tests on the surveillance specimens
were compared with data which we had obtained on the "MSRE materials” in
other irradiation experiments in the ORR. The results used in this
comparison are given in Table 12. The creep-rupture lives are compared in-
Fig. 22. The data for heat 5085 agree quite well with those obtained
previously in the ORR for this same heat and several other MSRE heats.
However, the results for heat 5081 are slightly superior. The fracture
strains for the various heats of irradiated material are compared in Fig. 23.
The data indicate a minimum ductility for a rupture life of 1 to 10 hr with
ductility increasing with increasing rupture life. A lower ductility of
heat 5085 after irradiation in the MSRE is also indicated, although the
data scatter will not permit this as an unequivocal conclusion. The
superior ductility of heat 5081 and the least ductility of heat 5065 (heat
used for the top and bottom heads of MSRE) are clearly illustrated.

Since transients may occur in which the material is strained at some
temperature other than the operating temperature (650°C), we ran a series
of tests to determine what effect such transients could have on the
fracture strain at 650°C. The results of these tests are given in Table 13.
The specimens were strained at other temperatures and then quickly cooled
‘or heated to 650°C and tested to failure. Even though the prestraining
treatments carried the specimens as far as 37% of the strain to failure,

the strain at 650°C was not decreased. In fact, the prestraining at

760 and 850°C seemed to improve the ability of the material to strain at
650°C. }

Several. of the specimens were examined metallographically after
testing. Figure 24 shows the microstructure of a control specimen from
heat 5081 that was tested at 25°C. ‘The specimen has undergone extensive
‘deformation, and the fracture is typical of a transgranular shear-type
failure. There is no evidence of intergranular cracking. In contrast,
the irradiated specimen from the same heat, shown in Fig. 25, failed
intergranularly with less strain and considerable intergranular cracking.

At 650°C the failure of the control specimen was predominantly
intergranular (Fig. 26). The failure of the surveillance specimen was
also intergranular at 650°C with no microstructural evidence of plastic
deformation (Fig. 27).

The failure ¢ of the control material from heat 5085 was found to be
predominantly intergranular (Fig. 28). However, the elongated grains
attest to the large amount of strain that has occurred. The large
precipitates have been identified as MgC, and “they normally fracture when
strained at temperatures less than about 500°C. The surveillance specimen
from heat. 5085 tested at 25°C is shown in Fig. 29. The failure is largely
intergranular with numerous intergranular cracks in the microstructure.

The - edge of ‘the ‘specimen (Fig. 29b) is quite clean with no evidence of
corrosion or material deposition. However, the part of the specimen that
touched the. graphite. in the surveillance assembly was found to have a
reaction product near the surface varying from 1 to 2 mils in depth (Fig. 30).
This product was not distributed uniformly around the specimen and varied
in form from a lamellar to a rope-like intergranular product. At 650°C the
failure of the: control specimen was predominantly intergranular (Fig. 31).
The surface Tesction product observed in specimens from the reactor where
they were in contact with the graphite was also noted in the control
specimens’ (Fig.: 232). - Although “the micrographs that have ‘been shown are

for heat 5085, the surface reaction was also noted in heat 5081. Electron
microprobe examination showed that this layer contained’ from

0.3 to 1.5 wt % C, indicating that there was some transfer of carbon from
the graphite to the Hastelloy N where the two materials were in contact.
Figure 33 shows the fracture of the surveillance specimen from heat 5085
that was tested at 650°C. The failure is predominantly intergranular with
no metallographic evidence of plastic deformation.

Extraction replicas were made on the surveillance and control specimens.
This technique involves depositing carbon on a polished surface of the
specimen and then dissolving electrolytically the matrix in a solution of

10% HCl in ethanol until the carbon falls free. The precipitates are not

attacked by the solution, and they are held by the carbon. After suitable

washing and drying, the replica can be examined in the electron microscope.
Transmission electron micrographs can be made as well as selected area
diffraction patterns for phase identification. An extraction replica of

a control specimen from heat 5081 is shown in Fig. 34. The ‘predominant

feature is the relatively large precipitates that have been identified

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

Because of the large amount of data presented, we will briefly
recapitulate the most important observations. ’

1. The control specimens from both heats of Hastelloy N exhibited
the characteristic ductility minimum in the temperature range of 600 to -
700°C. The ductility at various temperatures was reasonably insensitive
to strain rate except near 650°C where the ductility decreased with
decreasing strain rate.

2. After irradiation the tensile auctility was reduced significantly.
There was an unexpected reduction in the room temperature ductility with
fracture strains in the range of 35 to 40% being observed. Intergranular
fractures were obtained at room temperature in heat 5085. The fracture
strain generally became lower as the test temperature was increased and
the strain rate decreased. |

3. At elevated temperatures (400-850°C) the fracture strains were
equivalent for the two heats of surveillance specimens and were found to
be the same as those observed previously in other experiments where
molten salt was not present. |

4. Creep-rupture tests run on unirradiated specimens indicated that
the pretest anneal of 2 hr at 900°C improved the rupture strength and
ductility over that of the material in the as-received condition. Thus,

the stress-relieving anneals at 871°C used in fabricating the MSRE

improved the base properties. However, the long exposure of the control

specimens at 650°C (operating temperature of the MSRE) caused slight
reductions in rupture strength and ductility.

5, The creep-rupture life of the surveillance specimens was less
than that of the control specimens, the effect being greater at. the
higher stress levels. Heat 5085 was: affected much as we had observed
previously in other: experiments on this same heat and other MSRE heats.
Heat 5081 exhibited a significant but smaller effect.

6. The creep-rupture ductility of irradiated Hastelloy N goes

through a minimum value for a rupture life of from 1 to 10 hr. The

fracture strain increases as the. rupture life increases (or the’ stress

level decreases). Heat 5081 exhibited | appreciably higher fracture strains

 
 

 

 

50

than did heat 5085. Heat 5065 (material used for the top and bottom
heads of the MSRE) exhibited the lowest ductility of any heat examined
to date.

7. A series of tensile tests indicated that prestraining at
temperatures over the range of 400 to 850°C did not appreciably lower
the fracture strain of the material when tested to failure at 650°C.

8. Neither the control nor the surveillance specimens showed any
evidence of corrosion. However, there was a surface product from
0.001 to 0.002 in. in depth that formed where the Hastelloy N and graphite
were in contact. Microprobe studies indicate that this layer is high in
carbon, and hence the reaction product is probably a metal carbide.

9. Extraction replicas indicated that more intergranular precipitate
formed in the surveillance specimens than in the controls. Thus,
irradiation mist enhance the nucleation and growth of the precipitate
(identified as MgC). |

The changes in the unirradiated properties of these heats of
Hastelloy N have been demonstrated previously.” However, these changes
are relatively small, and the properties do not appear to be deteriorating
enough for concern. They are probably due to the solution and
reprecipitation of MgC.

The effects of irradiation on Hastelloy N are drastic, but pretty
much as expected. Previous work had shown a reduction in the rupture
ductility in postirradiation tensile and creep-rupture tests at elevated

‘temperatures. 8s ° These effects are attributed to the helium produced by
the 1%B(n,x) transmutation. Many of the details of the role of helium

in metals have been reviewed by Harries, © and we have applied these

ideas to Hastelloy N in two-recent papers. 11,12 Hence, we shall not
discuss the mechanism whereby helium alters the properties. There are
some questions concerning the comparison of thermal flux measurements
for the MSRE and ORR. However, about 30 to 40% of the 108 was transmuted
in the surveillance specimens with a resulting atomic fraction of helium
of about 1 x 107%, We feel that, at least at low strain rates, the
deterioration of properties saturates at helium levels an order of magnitude
lower. Hence, the exact helium level is rather academic, and the high-
temperature properties have probably stabilized unless continued exposure
at 650°C causes metallurgical changes that are detrimental. The drop in
ductility at low temperatures is somewhat surprising and bears watching.
However, the ductility levels are still quite reasonable.

The mechanical properties appear unaffected by the salt. This is
evidenced by the excellent agreement between the results of tests on
materials irradiated in the MSRE and the ORR (helium environment), The
small amount of carburization that occurred in the Hastelloy N which was
in contact with graphite was not surprising and did not extend to alarming
depths.

The very low stress levels in the MSRE during normal operation, *3
coupled with the experimental observation that the deterioration of the
creep-rupture properties (rupture life and ductility) due to irradiation
becomes smaller at low stresses, indicate that transient conditions offer
the greatest risk of failure. Thus, with reasonable care in operation, it

does not appear at this time that the life of the MSRE will be limited by

“radiation damage to the Hastelloy N.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have tested the first group of surveillance specimens from the
MSRE core. They were removed after 7800 Mwhr of operation during which
the specimens were held at 645 + 10°C for 4800 hr and accumulated a
thermal dose of 1.3 X 102° neutrons/cm®. Specimens were exposed to
molten salt to duplicate the thermal history of the surveillance specimens.
Two heats of material, 5081 and 5085, were used with both showing similar
deterioration of tensile ductility at elevated temperatures. However,
heat 5085 (cylindrical core vessel) exhibited a greater loss of creep- -
rupture strength and ductility. The property changes were quite similar
to those that had been observed for these same materials after irradiation
in the ORR where the ‘environment was helium, There was a significant
reduction ih the low-temperature ductility, but fracture strains of
35 to 40% were still obtained. This change in properties is probably
due to the formation of intergranular MgC.

~~ We noted the formation of a carbon-rich layer on the Hastelloy N
where it was in contact with graphite. This layer was only 1 to 2 mils
deep and probably would have little effect on the mechanical properties
of thick sections. Sacrificial metal shims were placed in the MSRE
-where the graphite and Hastelloy N were in contact, so the noted

fer

carburization should present no problems in the MSRE.

The mechanical properties of the Hastelloy N appear to be quite
adequate for the normal operating conditions of the MSRE. However,
transients should be prevented that expose the material to high stresses

- {
or strains.
