SUMMARY OF THE OBJECTIVES, THE DESIGN, AND A PROGRAM
OF DEVELOPMENT OF MOLTEN-SALT BREEDER REACTORS

ABSTRACT

Molten-salt thermal breeder reactors are characterized by low
specific inventory, moderate breeding gain with low fuel cycle cost,
and high efficiency for converting heat into electricity. Studies
indicate they should be able to produce electricity in 1000-Mw(e)
stations for about 2.6 mills/kwhr in investor-owned utilities, a

‘cost that is as low or lower than projected for advanced converter

reactors or fast breeder power stations. The fuel utilization
characteristics compare favorably with those of fast breeders.

The present status of the breeder technology is being demon-
strated in successful operation of the .Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment.
A two-region Molten-Salt Breeder Experiment to demonstrate all the

‘basic technology for full-scale breeders is proposed as the next

step in the development. Design and construction of the MSBE would
be accompanied by a program of fuels, materials, fuel reprocessing,
and engineering development. Development, construction, and startup
of the breeder reactor is estimated to take about eight years and
to cost about $125 million.

WHY DEVELOP MOLTEN-SALT BREEDERS?

Nuclear power, based on light-water-moderated converter reactors,
seems to be an assured commercial success. This circumstance has placed
upon the Atomic Energy Commission the burden of forestalling any serious
rise in the cost of nuclear power once our country has been fully committed
to this source of energy. It is for this reason that the development of
an economical breeder, at one time viewed as a long-range goal, has emerged
as the central task of the atomic energy enterprise. Moreover, as our
country commits itself more and more heavily to nuclear power, the stake
in developing the breeder rises: - breeder development simply must not fail.
All plausible paths to a successful breeder must therefore be ‘examined
carefully.

To be successful a breeder must meet three requirements. First, the
breeder must be technically feasible. Second, the cost of power from the

© breeder must be low; and third, the breeder should. utilize fuel so effi-

ciently that a full-fledged energy economy based on the breeder could be
established without using high-cost ores. The molten-salt breeder appears

to meet these criteria as well as, and in some respects better than, any

other reactor system. Moreover, since the technology of molten-salt
breeders hardly overlaps the technology of the solid-fueled fast reactor,
its development provides the world with an alternate path to long-term
cheap nuclear energy that is not affected by any obstacles that may crop
up. in the ‘development of ‘the fast breeder.

The molten-salt. breeder, though ‘seeming to be a by-vay in reactor
development, in fact represents the culmination of more than 17 years of
research and development. "The incentive to develop a reactor based on
fluid fuels has been strong ever since the early days of the Metallurgical
Laboratory. In 1958 the most prominent fluid fuel projects were the:
liquid bismuth reactor, the aqueous homogeneous reactor, and the molten-
salt reactor. In 1959 the AEC assembled a task force to evaluate the
three concepts. The principal conclusion of their report} was that the
"molten-salt reactor has the ‘highest probability of achieving technical
feasibility." :

This verdict of the: 1959 task force appears to be confirmed by the’
operation of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment. To those who have
followed the molten-salt project closely, this success is hardly sur-
prising. The essential technical feasibility of the molten-salt system
is based on certain thermodynamic. realities first pointed out by the late
R. C. Briant, who directed the ANP project at ORNL. Briant pointed out

nickel-based structural materials; that, being ionic, they should suffer
no radiation damage in the liquid state; and that, having low vapor
pressure and being relatively inert in contact with air, reactors based
on them should be safe. The experience -at ORNL with molten salts during
the intervening years has confirmed Briant's chemical intuition. Though.
some technical uncertainties remain, particularly those connected with
the graphite moderator, the path to a successful molten-salt breeder
appears to be well defined.

N

 
 

 

We estimate that a 1000-Mw(e) molten-salt breeder should cost $115
per kilowatt (electric).and that the fuel cycle cost ought to be in the
range of 0.3 to O.t mill/kvhr(e). The overall cost of power from a pri-
vately owned, 1000-Mw(e) Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor should come to
around 2.6 mills/kvhr(e). In contrast to the fast breeder, the extremely
low cost of the MSER fuel cycle hardly depends upon sale of byproduct

, fissile material. Rather, it depends upon certain advances in the chemical
processing of molten fluoride salts that have been demonstrated either in.
pilot plents or leboratories: fluoride volatility to recover uranium,

- vacuum distillation to rid the salt of fission products, .and for highest

. performance, but with somewhat.less assurance, removal of protactinium by

liquid-liquid extraction or ‘&bsorption.

The molten-salt ‘breeder, operating in the thermal Th-233y eyele, is
characterized by a low breeding retio: the maximum breeding ratio con-
sistent with low fuel cycle costs is estimated to be ebout 1.07. This

. low breeding ratio is compensated by the low specific inventory* of the

MSBR., Whereas the specific inventory of the fast reactor ranges between
2.5 to 5 kg/Mw(e), the Specific inventory of the molten-salt breeder
ranges between 0, f to 1.0 kg/Mw(e). The estimated fuel doubling time.
for the MSBR therefore fells in the range of 8 to 50 years. This is com-
parable to estimates of doubling’ times of 1 to 30 years given in fast -
breeder reactor design studies.

From the point of view of long-term conservation of resources, low
specific inventory in itself confers an advantage upon the thermal breeder.
If the amount of nuclear power grows linearly, the doubling time and the
specific inventory enter symmetrically in determining the maximum emount
of raw material that must be mined in order to inventory the whole nuclear
system. Thus, low specific inventory is an essential criterion of merit:
for a breeder, and the detailed comparisons in the next section show that
a good thermal breeder with low specific inventory could, in spite of its
low breeding gain, meske better use of our nuclear resources than a good
fast breeder with high specific inventory end high breeding gain.

The molten salt.approach to a breeder promises: to satisfy the three
criteria of technical feasibility, very low power cost, and good fuel
utilization. Its development as & uniquely promising’ competitor to the
fast breeder is, we believe, in the national interest. i

It is our purpose in the remainder of this report to outline the
current status of the technology, and to estimate what is required to
develop end demonstrate the technology for a full-scale thermal breeder
based on molten fluorides.

FUEL-UTILIZATION COMPARISON
Growth of Electric Generating Capacity

The importance of good fuel utilization can be shown simply as
follows. A projection of the rate of growth of the. electrical generating
capacity in the U.S. is presented in Table 1. Numbers through the year
2000 were based on estimates developed by the Federal Power Commission
and the AEC for the Report to the President in 1962 and were the nuclear
capacities updated to reflect the present rapid growth of nuclear electric
capacity. The total capacities for the years beyond 2000 were based, in
Case A, on continued growth at the exponential rate of about 5% per year
and, in Case B; on continued growth at a linear rate of 100,000 Mw/yr--
the rate at year 2000. In Case B, the rate of expansion of total electrical
generating capacity would be down to about 2% per year by the year 2030.
The nuclear capacities for the years beyond 2000 were extrapolated on the
basis that all new generating capacity after about 2020 would be nuclear.

Fuel-Utilization Characteristics of Converter Reactors:

The efficiency of fuel utilization is. determined by the quantity of
Ualg required to provide the total inventory of fissionable materiel
associated with the reactor per megawatt of electrical generating capacity
and the quantity of Ua0Dg required per year per megawatt of electrical
generating capacity to provide for burnup of fissioneble material. These om
requirements are listed in Table 3 for several types of reactors. The OW

indicated should be attainable within a few years, except possibly for
the hypothetical Very Advanced Converter Reactor, which has a much lower
specific inventory and & conversion ratio “approaching one. The latter is
included to show what greatly improved "advanced converters" or high-
performance near-breeders might accomplish. In the studies from which
the data were taken, the reactors were generally optimized to obtain the
lowest power cost from low-cost fuels. Recycle of plutonium is assumed
in estimating the burnup. Optimization for use of higher cost fuels
would have resulted in better, but not greatly better, fuel utilization
and higher power costs.

Fuel Resource Requirements with Converter Reactors

The deta from Tebles 1 and 3 were used to obtain the curves in Fig. 1.
The assumption was made that only boiling or pressurized water reactors
would be built until 1976. Beginning in 1976 advanced converters associ-
ated with a given curve would begin to be built and by 1988 all new reac-
tors would be advanced converters. Each reactor built was assumed to have
a life of 30 years. . .

The emount of uranium required for the inventory and the total burnup
to any given date is shown in Fig. 1 along with the total estimated re-
sources and the total cost of obtaining those resources. The fuel require-
ments for pressurized and boiling water reactors do not differ appreciably
and would require the mining of all our reserves costing less than $30 per
pound by shortly after the year 2000. If the industry continues to expand
as projected and the estimate of the availability and cost of the fuels
is reasonably accurate, all the fuel available for less then $50 per pound
would have to be mined by 2030 at a cost of about $700 billion. The
advanced converters presently proposed will buy 5 to 10 years! time in
uranium reserves over the pressurized end boiling water reactors.

Further extension by converter reactors would require development of
a reactor--probably of a completely different type--with a much lower
specific inventory and a higher conversion ratio. Even with such a very
advanced converter, the total domestic uranium resource, available for
less than $50 per pound Uz0g, would be consumed by about 2050.

Figure 1 does not give the whole picture. A power reactor should
run dependably and profitably for sbout 30 years, so when a reactor is
built, we, in a sense, commit a fuel supply for 30 years. For the reac-
tors and growth rates used in meking the curves in Fig. 1, the total
commitment at any given time is about the same as the total shown for

the inventory and burnup 10 years later. Reactors built as late as 1990
in an "all-water-reactor economy" would be fueled initially with uranium
costing as little as $10 per pound UsOg. However, the cost of fuel could
be expected to rise to $30 per pound of UsOg during the life of the plant
if there were no further expansion of the power industry, and to #0 per
pound if the industry continued to expand rapidly.

The ThOz commitment is &bout the same for the HWOCR, HIGR, and the

VACR. The light water breeder reactor has & much greater thorium inventory.

In all cases the thorium inventory is several times the 30-year burnup, so

the amount of thorium required at any time is close to the total commitment.

Although much less thorium is required than urenium, the low-cost reserves
are smaller and would be used in inventory by 2010 to 2030.

The effect of the cost of Uz0g and ThOz on the cost of power is shown

in Table 4 for the reactors and the corresponding inventory and consumption

numbers from Teble 3. These costs are only the costs associated with the
raw materials end do not reflect the higher enrichment, fabrication, pro-
cessing, and other costs that invarisbly accompany increases’ in raw mate-
rial cost. They are, however, for reactors that have not been optimized
for use of high-cost resources. All except the very best converter reac-
tors would suffer heavy penalties if the UsOg cost were to rise to $30
per pound. In the thorium reactors, the consumption is small, and for
those reactors with low inventory the use of high-cost resources has only
a small effect on the power cost. The light water breeder reactor would
incur a considerable cost penalty in an era of high-cost thorium.

resource requirements depends on the specific inventory and doubling time
of fissile material in the breeder system, the growth rate of the nuclear
power industry, and the capacity in converter reactors at the time the
breeders begin to be used for essentially all new capacity. Character-
istics taken from studies of oxide- and carbide-fueled fast breeders and -
of a molten-salt-fueled thermal breeder are presented in Teble 5. The
estimated doubling times vary from T to 30 years for the fast breeders
and from 8 to 50 years for the thermal breeder.

Fuel Resource Requirements with Breeder Reactors

The total resource requirements¥* for a power industry in which only
water reactors are built until 1976 or 1986 and only breeders are built
after 1988 end 1998, respectively, are presented in Figs. 2 and 3. The
figures show the total resource requirements to depend heavily on the -
capacity in water reactors at the time when breeder reactors ere intro-
duced end, by comparison with Fig. 1, 1 the great incentive for expediting
the development of breeders.

The thermal breeder is clearly competitive with the fast breeders
in reducing the requirements for mined uranium. If the doubling time is
less than ebout 12 years, the maximm resource requirement depends more
on doubling time than specific inventory, so there is little difference

 

~ ¥Inventory in converter and breeder reactors, plus net consumption
by converters minus net production by breeders.

between fast and thermal breeder systems. For longer doubling times, the
specific inventory assumes greater importance and the maximum requirements
for thermal breeder systems become increasingly less than those for fast
breeder systems with equal doubling times. Once the maximum requirement
is satisfied, the fast breeders produce much larger amounts of excess
fissionable material. Whether this is important depends on the need for
the excess material,

Figures 2 and 3 were based on starting the fast breeder reactors
with plutonium and the thermal breeders with ®33U,: The fast breeders
require an inventory of 3 to 5 kg of plutonium per megawatt of electric
generating capacity, and the PWR's and HWR's produce 0.2 to 0.3 kg of
plutonium per year per megawatt of electric generating capacity. The
growth rate of the nuclear generating capacity is T to 10% per year from
1980 to 2000. The converters and the breeders coming into operation
would be able to provide the inventory for high-performance fast breeders
but would fall rapidly behind if the breeders were to have doubling times
longer than about 12 years. Additional thermal converters or fast con-
verters would have to be built or the breeders would have to be fueled
initially with 25U. This could add significantly to the resource re-
quirement and the fuel cycle costs during the period of conversion to
operation on plutonium. Co N

Thermal breeders are also likely to be fueled initially with 235U
to produce en inventory of 2337, However, the conversion time is only
about one year and the additional resource requirement and the cost
penalty are small,

 

COST~OF ~-POWER COMPARISON

Capital Costs

Although molten-salt thermal breeder reactors are competitive with
fast breeder reactors and superior to the converter reactors with respect
to the efficient use of nuclear fuel resources, they must also produce
power for as low or lower cost. No large molten-salt reactors or fast
breeders and few large advanced converters have been designed in detail,

- so most of the costs must be educated estimates based on comparisons of

the reactor systems and judicious use of information from reactors that
are being built. Such a comparison was made of several advanced con-
verter reactors and reported in ORNL- 3686.2 The results ere summarized
“in Table 6. A comparable estimate of costs for a large molten-salt

thermal breeder reactor, made by the same people and reported in ORNL-
- 3996 (ref. 3), is also included in the table, along with the fuel cycle

costs from several studies of fast breeder reactors. Capital costs were
not estimated in the fast breeder studies. In all cases the costs in
the table are for investor-owned utility plants which carry a 12% per

Lo year charge on investment in plant and 10% per year on inventory of fuel.

The comparisons show that the capital cost of a large power station
containing a molten-salt breeder reactor should not be much different

from one containing a thermal converter reactor. We believe this is a
reasonable conclusion. . The molten-salt reactor uses high-nickel alloys--
which are more expensive than stainless steels--for structural material,
uses expensive graphite in the core, has an intermediate heat transfer
system between the reactor primary system and the steam system, and
requires special provisions for remote maintenance of radioactive equip-
ment, However, the salts are good heat transfer fluids with high volu-
metric heat capacity, are chemically stable at high temperature and, we:
believe, at very high power density, have low vapor pressure, and can be
used with large temperature differences without mass transfer difficulties.
They do not undergo violent chemical reactions with air or water. The
primary and secondary systems cen be compact and, except for parts of the
steam generators, can be built for low pressure. The reactor can be
fueled while at power by means of relatively simple equipment, and the
amount of excess reactivity can be kept small. The plant can operate

at the highest thermal efficiency obtainable with modern steam plant
practice, so the cost in dollars per electrical kilowatt can be low even
though the plant may have more equipment and the dollars per thermal kilo-
watt may be higher than for a water reactor.

Operating Costs

In Table 6 the operating costs for the molten-salt reactors are
shown to be the same as for the converter reactors. Most of the operating
costs do not vary much with type of reactor. We have not studied the
operation and maintenance enough to know whether an appreciable cost
penalty results from handling of the larger quantities of radioactive
wastes and from maintenance of the more-than-normally radioactive equip-
ment in a molten-salt reactor plant, so none was included here. Several
million dollars was included - in the capital cost for special maintenance
equipment. .

Fuel Cycle and Total Power Costs

~ Table 6 shows that the fuel cycle cost for a molten-salt thermal
breeder reactor is lower’ than for any of the converter or fast breeder
reactors. The molten fuel and blanket salts can be reprocessed continu-
ously or semicontinuously by simple physical and chemical processes,

‘such as vacuum distillation and: fluoride volatility, in a small plant

connected directly to the reactor. Fuel fabrication and shipping costs
are eliminated; burnup cost (thorium) is negligible; the inventory

charges are minimal; the credit for bred fuel is small. All these com-
“bine to prgduce very low fuel cycle costs that depend very little on the
gale of 23U, The contribution ‘of the mined ThO> end Us0g costs to the

total power cost is small, so the increase in power cost in going from
the present low-cost resources to $50-per-pound resources. should be less
than 0.3 mill/kwhr. The very low fuel cycle cost results in the molten-
salt reactor having an estimated power cost that is substantially lower
than for any of the converter reactors.
 

 

22

If one accepts, in the absence of estimates, that the costs for
building and operating large power plants containing fest breeder reactors
should not differ greatly from the costs for the other plants in Table 6,
then differences in power costs depend primarily on differences’ in fuel
cycle costs. According to the numbers in the table, the fuel cycle costs
and the total power costs for the fast breeder plants are mostly lower
than for the converter plants but higher than for the molten-salt thermal .
~ breeder plant. \

How the molten-salt thermal breeder and the, fast breeders compare
depends strongly on such characteristics of the fast breeders as the
relationship between the plutonium inventory, the breeding gain, the
charge assessed against the inventory, and the value of the excess plu-
tonium produced. These factors can be so adjusted that a fast breeder
with a very short doubling time could have negative fuel cycle costs.
In view of the many uncertainties, we interpret the date in Table 5 to
indicate primarily that a molten-salt thermal breeder plant could produce
power at a cost competitive with the cost of power from & fast breeder
plant and with far less dependence on the sale of fissionable material.
The molten-salt thermal breeder is clearly a strong competitor to the
fast breeder for achieving the goal of producing power at low cost with
good fuel utilization.

1000-Mi(e) MOLTEN-SALT THERMAL BREEDER POWER PLANT

Studies of the conceptual design of a 2000-Mw(e) molten-salt thermal
breeder power plant (MSER) end of some alternatives or improvements are
reported in ORNL-3996, ORNL-4037, and ORNL-4119. Results of the studies
are summarized here end in some instances are adjusted to incorporate
more recent information.

The MSER reference design is & two-region, two-fluid system with
fuel salt separated from the blanket salt by graphite tubes. The fuel
salt consists of uranium fluoride dissolved in a mixture of lithium end
beryllium fluorides, and the blanket salt ‘is & thorium fluoride — lithium
fluoride mixture of eutectic composition. The heat generated in those
fluids is trensferred in a primary salt-circulating system to & coolant
salt in a secondary circuit which couples the reactor to a supercritical
steam cycle. Fuel and blanket are processed on site by: means of fluoride
volatility end vacuum distillation processes.

A design called MSBR(Pa) is & favored variation of the MSER. It is
the same as the reference design except that the blanket salt is processed
to remove protactinium on ebout a half-day cycle. This results in improved
rerformance through a higher breeding ratio, & smaller inventory of
fissile materiel in the blenket, and a considerable reduction: in the in-
ventory of blanket salt. :

23

Two methods of removing protactinium from fluoride melts have been
tested on small scale in the lsboratory. In one, PaO was shown to pre-
cipitate on ThOp that had been added as a solid to & molten fluoride
salt. In the second, protactinium was extracted from a fluoride melt
by molten bismuth with thorium metal as a reducing agent. , The chemistry
of these processes is favorable, so further work should provide an in-
organic ion exchange process or & liquid-metal extraction process for

removing protactinium continuously and inexpensively from the blanket

salt of a breeder reactor.

Because the designs are so similar the MSBR and MSBR(Pa) are treated
below as one plant. Characteristics for both are reported where they
differ. :

Reference Plant Design

Fuel, Blanket, and Coolant Salts

Fuel salt for the reactor is & ternary mixture consisting of about
0. ax UF4, 65.7% "LiF, and 34% BeFo. This salt is similar to the fuel
in the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment. A salt containing 27% ThF¢, T1%
LiF, and 2% BeFp is proposed for the blanket. A mixture of 48% NaF, 4%
KF, and 48% BFs is the favored coolant salt because of its low liquidus
temperature and low cost. Estimates of the physical properties of the
salts are reported in Table T.

Flowsheet

A flowsheet for the 1000-Me(e) plant is presented in Fig. Lh, Fuel

‘1s pumped through the reactor at a rate of about 44,000 gpm, entering

the core at 1000°F and leaving at 1300°F. The PEERY fuel system has
four loops, each loop having a heat exchanger and & pump of 11,000-gpm
capacity. The blanket system has four pumps and heat exchangers, smaller
but similar to the components:in the fuel system. Blanket salt circu-
lates through each of the four loops at a rate of 2000 gpm, entering the
reactor vessel at 1150 °F and leaving at 1250°F.

Four 1&4, , 000-gpm pumps circulate the sodium fluoroborate coolant

salt through the shell sides of the primary heat exchangers. The salt

enters at 850°F, leaves at 1112°F, and then passes through the shell
sides of the blanket heat exchangers where it is further heated to
1125°F., The coolant then passes in parallel through sixteen once-through

boiler-superheaters end elght steam reheaters.

The steam system is essentially that of the new ; Bull Run plant of the
TVA, modified to increase the rating to 1000 Mw(e) and to preheat the work-
ing fluid to TOO°F before it enters the boiler-superheaters. Use of the
supercritical steam cycle appears to ease some problems of design of steam
generators for molten-salt reactors and results in a thermal efficiency of
about 45%.

Reactor Design

The MSER cell arrangement is shown in plen in Fig. 5. On two sides
of the reactor cell are four shielded cells containing the boiler-super-
heaters and the reheaters; those cells can be isolated individually for
maintenance. A cell for handling the gaseous fission products from the
reactor and two cells for processing the fuel and blanket salts are ad-
Jecent to the reactor cell. Cells are also provided for decontamination
and storage end repair of redicactive equipment.

An elevation of the plant in Fig. 6 shows the arrangement of equipment
in the reactor and coolant cells, and a more detailed view of the reactor
primary equipment ie shown in Fig. 7. The reactor vessel is about 14 ft /
in diameter by about 19 ft high, is designed for 1200°F and 150 psi end
has & metal-wall thicknesses in the range of 1 to 3 in.

The reactor vessel contains & 10-ft-diem by 12-1/2-ft-high core
assembly composed of 534% graphite fuel cells of a type similar to that
shown in Fig. 8. Fuel from the entrance plenum in the reactor vessel
flows upward through the annulus and downward through the large central
passage in the graphite tubes to the outlet plenum. Fuel is circulated
from the outlet plenum through the pumps to the heat exchangers and then
back to the reactor. A 1-1/2-ft-thick blenket and a 3-in.-thick graphite
reflector surround the core. The thorium salt circulates through the
"blanket region, through the passages between fuel cells in the core, and
through the heat removal system outside the reactor vessel,

Values chosen for some of the MSER and MSER(Pa) design parameters
are listed in Teble 8.

The reactor vessel and all other equipment that holds salt is made
of Hastelloy N, a nickel-base alloy containing ebout 17% molybdenum, T%
chromium, and kf iron. This materiel is highly resistant to corrosion

by fluoride salts and has good strength at high temperature. The high-
temperature creep properties of Hastelloy N presently obtainable commerci-
ally deteriorate under irradistion, but small changes in the alloy offer
promise of eliminating this deficiency.

The graphite is a high-density grade processed to achieve small pore
openings for low permesbility to salt. Superior resistance to damage by
irradiation is important, but the core is designed to keep the flux gradi-
ents small scross individual pieces and to permit the graphite to expand
or contract with little restraint.

Heat Exchange,Systems

The fuel heat exchangers, are of the tube and shell design and are
combined with the pumps &s shown in Fig. 9. Fuel salt from the reactor
flows into the impeller of the pump and is discharged down through the
tubes of the inner bundle. It then flows upward through the tubes of

the outer bundle and back to the reactor core. The coolant salt enters

the shell at the bottom, flows upward slong the outer wall, then through
the tube bundles countercurrent to the flow of the fuel salt and out
through the center pipe. - « :

The blanket heat exchangers transfer only a small fraction of the

“heat, but they pass the full flow of coolant from the fuel heat exchangers.

They are similar to the fuel heat exchangers and are designed for single-
pass flow of coolant on ‘the shell side, although two-pass flow is retained
for blanket salt in the tubes.’

Fuel and blanket pumps ‘are sump~type pumps built into the upper heads

~ of the heat exchangers. While this complicates the design of some of the

equipment, it reduces the salt inventory (particularly in the fuel system),
the amount of piping, and some of the stress problems during heating and
cooling of the systems. Concentric piping is used between the reactor

vessel and the heat exchangers for the same reason. The fuel heat ex-
changers and pumps are below the core so the fuel salt in the core will
drain quickly into tanks, where it can be cooled more easily, if the

pumps stop.

The boiler-superheaters are long, slender, U-tube — U-shell exchangers.
Coolant salt flows through the shell, entering at 1125°F and leaving at
850°F. Water preheated to about. TOO°F enters the tubes at 3800 psi and
leaves as supercritical steam at 1000°F and 3600 psi.

Steam is extracted from the high-pressure turbine at about 550°F and
reheated to 1000°F and 540 psi before use in the intermediate pressure
turbine. This is accomplished by heating partly with prime steam in pre-

_ heaters and partly with coolant salt in reheaters.

Since ‘the freezing ‘temperature of the coolant salt is about TOO°F,

. it seems desirable to preheat the working fluid to almost TOO°F before

it enters the boiler-superheaters or reheaters. This is the purpose of

“the steam preheaters shead of the reheaters. The prime stesm from those

preheaters is injected into the feedwater in a mixing tee to heat the.
water to the desired temperature before it enters the boiler-superheaters.

Use of the supercritical steam cycle sakes possible this matching of
salt and feedwater temperatures. . It is believed to reduce the thermal
cycling (and fatigue) of the tubes that would occur in the boiling regions

‘of the steam generators at lower pressure. The net thermal efficiency -

of the plant is about 45% and would be higher if higher temperatures
could be used effectively in the steam system.

Fuel and Blanket- Processing

The primary objectives of the processing are to separate fission
products in low concentration from the other constituents of the fuel
salt and to separate bred fissile materiel in low concentration from the
other constituents of the blanket salt while keeping the losses and the
costs low. With the fluoride fuel and blanket salts of the MSBR, these.
objectives cen be fulfilled by a combination of fluoride volatility,

vacuum distillation and. protactinium- extraction processes. The process-

ing is done continuously or semicontinuously in cell space adjacent to

“the reactor; services and some other equipment required for the reactor

are shared by the processing plant. Shipping, long storage at the reactor
and reprocessing sites, and refabrication of fuel end blanket are elimi-
nated. All these factors lead to. yequees inventories, improved fuel

utilization, end reduced costs,

‘The fuel salt for the MSER &nd the 'MSBR(Pa) ie processed by fluoride

volatility to remove the uranium and by vacuum distillation to separate

the carrier salts from the fission products. For the MSER the blanket is
processed by fluoride volatility alone. The cycle time is short enough

to maintain the concentration of fissile material very low. The inventory
of blanket salt is made large to keep the Pa losses small. For the MSBR(Pa)
the blanket stream is treated by a liquid-metal extraction process
 

 

36

or an exchange process to remove Pa and 233 on a very short cycle, In |
this case the fissile inventory in the blanket and the blanket salt
inventory can be kept to a minim,

Principal steps in the processes are shown in Fig. 10, Small streams
of core end blanket fluids are withdrewn continuously from the reactor .
and circulated through the processing system. After processing, the decon-
teminated fluids are returned to the reactor at convenient points such as
the storage tanks. Inventories in the processing plant are estimated to .
be about 5% of the reactor fuel system inventory end less then 1% of the
blanket inventory.

The fuel and blanket processing plants are intended to operate con-
tinuously in conjunction with the reactor. However, the reactor can con-
tinue to operate when all or part of the processing plant 1s shut down for -
maintenance. - During a 30-day’ interruption in processing of the blanket,
the increase in concentration of 2335 1n the blanket salt would produce an .
increase of less than 20% in the amount of heat generated in the blanket.
Since 23y would not be availeble from the blanket, the burnup in the core
would have to be compensated by supplying fissile material from a reserve.

Interruption of the processing of the fuel stream would cause the
fission product concentration in the fuel to increase. Fissile material
would have to be added to compensate for burnup and for the gradual increase
in poison level. During periods of operation without processing, there
would also be & gradual decrease in the breeding gain. The decrease would
be less than 0.02 in 30 days. oo

Capital-Cost Estimates _
Reactor Power Plant

Preliminary estimates of the capital cost of a 1000-Mw(e) MSBR power
station indicate a direct construction cost of about $81 million. After
applying the indirect cost factors used in the advanced converter evalu-
ation,* the estimated total plent cost is $115 million for private financ-
ing and $111 million ‘for public financing. - A summary of plant costs is
given in Table 9. The conceptual design was not sufficiently detailed to
permit a completely reliable estimate; however, the design and estimates
were studied thoroughly enough to make meaningful compariséns with previ-
ous converter-reactor-plant cost studies. The relatively low capital
cost results from the small physical size of the MSBR and the simple con-
trol requirements. The results of the study encourage the belief -that
the cost of an MSBER power station vill be as low as for stations utilizing
other reactor concepts.

The - operating and maintenance costs. of the MSER were not estimated.
Based on the ground rules used in Ref. k, these costs would be O. 0.34

Fuel. Recycle Plant

The capital costs of the fuel recycle plant for processing 15 ft°/day
of fuel salt and 105 f£t°/dey of blanket .salt in & 1000-Mw(e) MSER power
station were obteined by itemizing and costing the major process equipment
and by estimating the costs of site, buildings, instrumentation, waste
disposal, and building services associated with fuel recycle. Table 10
summarizes the direct construction costs, the indirect costs, and totel
© costs of the plant. The total is $5.3 million. The operating and main-
tenance costs for the plent include labor, lsbor overhead, chemicals,
utilities, and maintenance materials. The total annual cost is estimated
to be about $721,000, which is equivalent to ebout 0.1 uill/kr(e)

A ‘breakdown of these charges’ is given in Teble 11.

The capital and operating costs for this plant were the basis for
deriving the costs of plents with other capacities. ~The relationship
of cost to volume of salt processed was estimated separately for fuel
and blanket streams to give" ‘the -curves shown in Fig. 11. Data from
those curves were used in the fuel-cycle-cost optimization studies to
represent the effects of varying the plent size and throughput. oN

For the MSER(Pa) plant the processing methods and costs were the
same as those for the MSBR plant except for the blanket processing. The
cost of protactinium removal from the blanket stream was estimated to be

o(re) = 1.65 R°**° | (1)

where C(Pa) is the capital cost of the protactinium removel equipment,

in millions of dollars, and R is the processing rate for protactinium
removal in thousands of cubic feet of blanket salt per day. Calculations
of the total costs of fuel recycle in the MSBR(Pa) were based on the
curves in Fig. 11 for the fuel stream:and on Eq. (1) combined with the
curves in Fig. 11 for the blanket stream.

Nuclear Performance and Fuel Gyele Analyses

The fuel cycle cost and the fuel yield are closely related, yet inde-
pendent in the sense that two nuclear designs can have similar costs but
significantly different yields. The objective of the nuclear design
calculations was primarily to find. the conditions that gave the lowest

Analysis Erocedures and Basic Assumptions

The nuclear calculations were performed with a mltigroup, aiffusion,
equilibrium reactor program, which caleulated the nuclear performance,
the equilibrium concentrations of the various nuclides, including the
fission products, :and the fuel-cycle cost for a given set of conditions.
The 12-group neutron cross sections were obtained from neutron spectrum -
calculations, with the core heterogeneity taken into consideration in
the thermal-neutron-spectrum computations. The nuclear designs were
optimized by parameter studies, with most emphasis on minimum fuel-cycle
cost and with lesser weight given to maximizing the annual fuel yield.
Typical parameters varied were the reactor dimensions, blanket thickness,
fractions of fuel and fertile salts in the core, and the fuel- and fertile-
stream processing rates.

The basic economic assumptions employed in obtaining the fuel-cycle
costs are given in Teble 12. The processing costs are based on those
given in the previous section and are included in the fuel-cycle costs.
A fissile material loss of 0.1% per pass through the fuel-recycle plant
was applied. J

The effective behavior used in the fuel-cycle-performance calcule-
tions for the various fission products was that given in Teblée 13. The
gas-stripping system is provided to remove fission-product gases from the
fuel salt. In the celculations reported here, the S5%e poison fraction
was assumed to be 0,005.

The control of corrosion products in molten-salt fuels does not
appear to be & significant problem, so the effect of corrosion products
was neglected in the nuclear calculations. The corrosion rate of Hastel-
loy N in molten sslts is very low; in addition, the fuel-processing
operations can control corrosion-product buildup in the fuel.

The importent paremeters describing the MSER and MSBR(Pa) designs
are given in Teble 8. Many of the parameters were fixed by the ground
rules for the evaluation or by engineering-design factors that include
the thermal efficiency, plant factor, capital charge rate, maximum fuel
velocity, size of fuel tubes, processing costs, fissile-loss rate, end
the out-of-core fuel inventory. The parameters optimized in the fuel-
cycle calculations were the reactor dimensions; power density, core =
composition (including the carbon-to-uranium and thorium-to-ursnium ratios),
and processing rates.

Nuclear Performance and Fuel-Cycle Cost

The general results of the nuclear calculations are given in Table 8;
the neutron-balance results are given in Table 14. The basic reactor
design has the advantage of zero neutron losses to structural materials
in the core other than the moderator. Except for the loss of delayed
neutrons in the external fuel circuit, there is almost no neutron leskage
from the reactor because of the thick blanket. The neutron losses to
fission products are low because of the low cycle times associated with
fission-product Temoval.

The components of the fuel-cycle cost for the MSBR(Pa) and the MSBR
are summarized in Table 15. The main components are the fissile inventory
and processing costs. The inventory costs are rather rigid for a given
reactor design, since they are largely determined by the external fuel
volume. The processing costs are a function of the processing-cycle
times, one of the chief parameters optimized in this study. As shown by
the results in Tables 8 and 15 the ability to remove protectinium directly
from the blanket stream has a marked effect on the fuel yield end lowers
the fuel-cycle cost by about 0.1 mill/kwhr(e). This is due primarily to
the decrease in neutron ebsorptions by protactinium when this nuclide is
removed from the core and blanket regions.

In obtaining the reactor design conditions, the optimization pro-
cedure considered both fuel yield and fuel-cycle cost as criteria of
performance, The corresponding fuel-cycle performance is shown in Fig.
12, which gives the minimum fuel-cycle cost as a function of fuel-yield
rate based on privately financed plants and a plant factor of O. 8. The"

‘design conditions for the MSBR(Pa) and MSBR concepts correspond to the

designated points in Fig. 12.

Power-Production Cost and Fuel-Utilization
Characteristics

The power-production costs are based on the capital costs given
gbove, operation and maintenance charges, and fuel-cycle costs. Table 16
summarizes the power-production cost and the fuel-utilization character-
istics of the MSBR(Pa) and MSBR plants. Both concepts produce power at
low cost end have good fuel-utilization characteristics. In terms of fuel
utilization, the MSBR(Pa) concept is comparable to a fast breeder reactor
with & specifi¢ inventory of 3 kg of fissile material per megawatt of"
electricity produced end a. ‘doubling time of ‘9 years, while the MSER plant
is comparable to the same fast ‘breeder with a doubling 1 time of 12 years.

me 5 to the Reference Design

The MSBR and MSBR(Pa) reference design represents extrapolation to
a large scale of technology that has-been mostly demonstrated on a.much
smaller scale. The major uncertainty is whether the graphite fuel cells
will have an economical life in the high fast neutron flux in the core.

This, :in turn, is related to the cost in equipment, effort, and downtime
to do maintenance of the highly radioactive core and other components

in the -réactor primary systems. Several alternatives to the reference
design have been proposed and they are primarily concerned with making
these problems less difficult and in some instances with generally im-
proving the performance of the breeders. These alternatives and the
extent to which they should be included in the program of development
of large power breeder stations are discussed below.

Modular Designs |

The reference design has four fuel circuits end four blanket circuits
operating off one reactor vessel in order to. produce 1000 Mw(e). One
coolant circuit is provided for each fuel and blanket circuit. If a
graphite tube in the core were to fail or & pump in the primary system
were to stop or & tube in a primary heat exchanger were to fail, the
entire plant would have to be shut down until the fault was repaired.

We believe the components can be made Telisble enough so that such shut-
downs will be infrequent, but they. will happen. .

As &n alternative, a modular design was evolved with the objective
of providing assurance of high plant availability. Each primary circuit
of the reference design and its secondary circuits were connected to &
separate reactor vessel to provide four 556-Mw(th) reactor modules. The
modules were installed in separate cells so that one could be repaired
vhile the others were operating. The layout is shown in plan and ele-

‘vation in Figs. 13 and 1k. ’ .

Although ‘the moduler design has four reactor vessels, they are
smaller than the reference vessel. The average power density in the
fuel salt and in the core are the same as in the reference reactor; the
reactor vessel for each module is bout 12 £1 in diameter by 15 ft high,
as compared with 14 ft diam by 19 ft high for the reference design. Most
of the rest of the equipment in the two types of plants is the same, and
the plents ere of very. nearly the same size. The increase in total cost
of the modular plant over the reference plant would be sbout L%; there
is no significent difference in breeding performance or in cost of the
power produced.

The reference design and the modular design described above operate
at the same high power density in the core and the graphite is subjected
to a high dose of demaging neutrons in a few years--10 neutrons/ cm®
(max) in four to six full-power years depending on the amount of flux
' flattening that can be achieved. This dose: is a factor of 4 higher than
has been achieved to date in in-pile. testing, and having to replace the
graphite every 5 years is estimated to increase the power cost by 0:05
to 0.1 mill/kvhr. Although there is considerable confidence that graphite
cen be developed to perform satisfactorily to even greater doses, several
years of irradistion in the HFIR and in EBR-II or other fast test reactors
is required to provide & firm basis for this confidence.

For these reasons the first molten-salt breeder reactors are likely
to be operated at lower power densities where an acceptable core life is
more easily assured, so considerable attention is being given to a modular
plant in which the average power density in the core is 40 kw/liter--
half the power density in the core of the reference design. Again the
only significant physical change in the plant is in the size of the core
and the reactor vessel. The reactor vessels become about 13 ft in diam-
eter by 17 ft high; the breeding ratio remains about the same, but the
yield decreases; the capital cost would be about 8h higher than for the
reference plant. Some characteristics of modular plants with full and
half power density in the core, with and without protactinium removal,
are shown in Tables 17 and 18. The plant factor is 0.8 as for the refer-
ence design, no credit being taken for being able to maintain a higher
plant factor.

Whether the modular design represents a more attractive or a less
attractive alternative to the reference design depends on the outlook of :
each designer and operator. The modules can be made larger than 556 Mw(th)
if desired, the capacity depending on the fraction of plant the operator
is willing to have shut down for repair on short notice. No special devel-
opment is required for the modular design. It should receive continued
attention as design studies are made. Construction of a plant of the
size of one module could be & desirable step in the development of large
pover breeder stations. :

Mixed-Fuel Reactor

In the reference design, graphite cells or tubes with graphite-to-
metal Joints on one end are used to keep the fuel and blanket salts from
mixing in the reactor vessel. The major feasibility question in the
design is whether the damage to the graphite by the high flux of fast
neutrons will cause the cells to crack or break in less than the three
to five years required for replacement to be economical.

"An alternative to this type of reactor is one in which both thorium
and uranium are contained in the fuel salt which flows through channels
in graphite bars much as it does in the MSRE. In order for the reactor
to be a breeder the core would have to be surrounded by a blanket as
shown in Fig. 15. The wall separating the core and blanket would be
Hastelloy N, niobium, or molybdenum, 1/8 to 1/k in. thick. Whether a
satisfactory core tank can be developed is the major feasibility question
of this reactor. Co

"The breeding performance of such a reactor is shown in Table 19.

The specific inventory and the doubling time can be attractively low.

Major requirements are that satisfactory processes be invented to sepa-
rate protactinium continuously from urenium and thorium in the fuel
stream and to separate thorium from fission products. The demands on
fuel processing for this reactor are considerably greater than those
imposed by the reference MSBR.

© pssumes that processing is no more complicated or expensive
than for reference MSER.

This alternative is attractive if serious problems are encountered
with the graphite tubes of the reference design, but substitutes problems ' 3
of & metal core tank end more difficult reprocessing. The neutron ab-
sorption in the metal core tank increases with decreasing core size, so |
the breeding performance would suffer if & moduler design were used and -
the reactor were made smaller to keep the specific inventory low. Work
on the mixed-fuel reactor should be limited to laboratory studies (or
observation of other groups'. studies) of the effects of radiation on the
high-temperature properties of potentiel core-tank materials, the compati-
bility of those materials with fluoride salts and graphite, and methods
of processing the fuel. If the results in the main line program indicate
that the graphite cells are unlikely to perform satisfectorily in the
reference design, the development should be shifted to this mixed-fuel
alternative. The reactors are so similar that most of the work done on
the reference breeder would be appliceble to this alternative.

A

Direct-Contact Cooling with Molten Lead -

The reference-design MSBR has three volumes of fuel outside the core
in heat exchanger, piping, plenum chambers, etc., for each volume of fuel
in the core. Studies indicate that the fuel volume could be reduced to
ebout one volume outside the core for each volume in the core if the fuel
salt were circulated and cooled by direct contact with molten lead. The

lead would be pumped into & jet at the lower end of each fuel tube. Salt
and leed would mix in the jet and be separated at the outlet, The salt
would return directly through the graphite cells to the core and the lead
would be pumped either through intermediate heat exchangers or directly to
the steam generstors.

This system has several advantages, Ideally the specific inventory \W/
could be reduced to 0.3 to 0.4 kg of 2337 per megawatt (électrical) and
»

the doubling time to 5 or 6 years. Relatively inexpensive lead would be
substituted for some of the lithium and beryllium fluorides. The lead
pumps and heat exchangers could be arranged for maintenance of individual
units with the remainder of the plant operating. Some parts of the plent
should be considerably simplified.

There are some uncertainties also. Thermodynamics data indicate that
lead, fuel and blanket salts, graphite, and refractory metals such as
niobium and molybdenum alloys should be compatible. Preliminary tests
indicate that this is true and that the much less expensive iron-chromium
alloys might be used in the main lead systems. However, the materials.
problems are almost unexplored; little is known of the effects of radi-
ation or fission products or of the ease of separating lead and salt.

The lead-cooled reactor represents an almost completely new technology
that cannot presently be given a good evaluation. Work on the basic
chemical, engineering, and materials problems of the system should be pur-
sued to a. a good evaluation possible within three or four years. If
direct-contact cooling proved to be practical, its adoption could produce
impressive improvements in the performance of the thermal breeders and
could point the way to the use of molten-salt fuels in fast breeders.

PROGRAM FOR DEVELOPMENT OF MOLTEN-SALT THERMAL BREEDER POWER PLANTS

We believe the information in the section on fuel utilization strongly
indicates the need for the U.S. to be able to build 1000-Mw(e) or larger
power breeder stations of high performance by about 1980, so they could be
built at a rate near 50,000 Mw(e) per year by about 1990. The development
program for a molten-salt thermal breeder should be aimed directly at that
goal. This requires an aggressive program, carefully planned and exe-
cuted and supported by firm intentions to carry it to completion unless
developments along the way show that the technical or economic goals
cannot be met. :

Steps in the Development’

The technology as it presently exists is embodied in the Molten-Salt
Reactor Experiment. The reactor is a one-region, one-fluid reactor. It
operates at 1200°F but at 7.5 Mw(th), so the power density is low. Some
exploratory tests, however, indicate that the fuel salts and the major

structural materials--graphite and Hastelloy N--should be: compatible at

pover densities far sbove the maximum in the reference breeder design.

"The MSRE plant includes some provision for fuel processing and for main-

tenance of radioactive equipment, but much less than will be needed in
a power breeder plant. :

Successful operation of the MSRE is providing an essential base for
proceeding with larger reactors, but a true breeder pilot plsnt--a Molten-
Salt Breeder Experiment--should be operated before building a prototype
power breeder plant. The MSBE should include the essential features and

 
 

 

60

satisfy all the technical criteria of the reference design, but it should
be sbout &s small & plant as will meet these requirements. According to
preliminary studies, the power would be 100 to 150 Mw(th). The experiment
would demonstrate all the basic equipment and processes under the most
severe conditions of the large plants; its essential purpose would be to
produce information rather than electricity.

A prototype power breeder station would follow the MSBE. The size
would be 250 to 500 Mw(e), one module of the modular design described
above. A full-scale plant could then be obtained by adding modules to
the prototype plant or by building a plant of the reference design with
heat transfer circuits of the size developed for the prototype.

Plans are discussed here and in related reports for designing, devel-
oping, and building the MSBE. They are aimed at having the experiment in
operation as soon as is consistent with resolving all basic problems
before beginning construction and major procurement for the plant. Detailed
design of the plent end research and development for all the parts proceed
concurrently. Design in detail is essential for identifying all the devel-
opment problems, and much of the development for & fluid fuel reactor con-
sists of building, testing, and modifying the equipment that has been
designed so that it will perform satisfactorily in the reactor.

Nuclear operation of the MSBE would begin in FY 1975. A prototype
could be in operation by 1980, and its construction would bring into
being the capability for bullding full-scale plants. This capebility
could then be expanded according to the needs of the time. We have not
included a more detailed schedule or a projection of the development
costs for the prototype or for plants beyond the prototype. If the
MSBE fulfills its purpose, the development would consist largely of
building and testing larger equipment and improving on demonstrated
processes. The rate and manner in which the work on lsrger reactors
would proceed and the distribution of expenditures between government
and industry are uncertain and are completely out of our control. We
therefore have limited our projections to the essential step in making
this further development feasible and attractive to the equipment industry
and the utilities.

Precent Status of the Technology - MSRE

The present status of the technology ie best described in terms of -
the MSRE and some supplementary information. The MSRE is a molten-salt-
fueled thermal reactor that produces heat at a rate of 7.5 Mw(th) while
operating at sbout 1200°F. The purpose of the reactor is to provide a
demonstration of the technology end a facility for investigating the
compatibility of fuels and materiels and the engineering features of
molten-salt reactors. The design conditions are shown in the flow dia-
gram in Fig. 16, and the general arrangement of the plant is shown in

The fuel for the MSRE is 65% "LiF-29.1% BeFz5% ZrFge—0.9% UF4.*
Except for the small smount of ZrF4 and the higher UFq concentration, it
is the fuel for the core of the reference breeder.

. In the reactor primary system the fuel salt is recirculated by a
sump-type centrifugal pump through a shell and U-tube heat exchanger and
the reactor vessel. The flow rate is about 1250 gpm. The MSRE normally
operates at about 7.5 Mw thermal and at that power level fuel enters the
reactor at 1168°F. and leaves at 1210°F. The base pressure in the system
is 5 psig in the helium cover gas over the free surface of salt in the

‘pump bowl. The maximum pressure is about 55 psig at the outlet of the

pump.

The heat generated in the fuel salt as it passes through the reactor
vessel is transferred in the heat exchanger to a molten-salt coolant con-
taining 66% "LiF and 34% BeFz. The coolant is circulated by means of &
second sump-type pump at a rate of 850 gpm through the heat exchanger,
normally entering at 1015°F and leaving at 1073°F, and through a radiator
where the heat is dissipated to the atmosphere. The base pressure in
this system is also 5 psig in the pump tank; the maximum pressure, at
the discharge of the pump, is 70 psig. .

Drain tanks are provided for storing the fuel and the coolant salts
at high temperature when the reactor is not operating. The salts drain
from the primary and secondary systems by gravity. They are transferred
between tanks or returned to the circulating systems by pressurizing the
drain tanks with helium.

The fission product gases krypton and xenon are removed -continuously
from the circulating fuel salt by spraying salt at a rate of 50 gpm into
the cover gas sbove the liquid level in the fuel pump tank. There they
transfer from the liquid to the gas phase and are swept out of the tank
by a small purge of helium. After a delay of about 1-1/2 hr in the
piping, this gas passes through water-cooled beds of gactivated carbon.
The krypton and xenon are delayed until all but the &3kr decay and then
are diluted with air and discharged to the atmosphere.

Fuel and coolant systems are provided with equipment for taking
samples of the molten salt through pipes attached to the pump tanks
while the reactor is operating at power. The fuel sampler is also used
for adding small amounts of fuel to the reactor vhile at power to com-
pensate for burnup. .

Finally, the Plant is provided with a simple processing facility for

treating full 75-£t2 batches of fuel salt with hydrogen fluoride and fluo-
rine gases. . The hydrogen fluoride treatment is for removing oxide con-

tamination from the salt as Hz0. The fluorine treatment is the fluoride
volatility process for removing the uranium as UFg. The equipment
approaches the size required for batchwise processing of the blanket of
the 1000-Mw(e) reference reactor.

~All the equipment in the MSRE thet contains salt is made of Hastelloy
N. All of it was designed to be &ble to operate at 1300°F. The liquidus
temperature of fuel and coolant salts is near 850°F. It is desirable to
keep the salts molten in the reactor systems end in the drain tanks, so
the major pieces of equipment ere installed in electrical furnaces end
the piping is covered by: electrical heaters and insulation,

The reactor primary system, the fuel drain tank system, and some

auxiliaries become permanently radioactive during the first few hours of

operation at apprecieble power. Maintenance of this equipment and associ-
ated heaters, insulation, and services must be done remotely or semi-
remotely by means of special tools. Tools have been developed for accom-
plishing this maintenance of the MSRE equipment. i

The MSRE reactor vessel is. shown in Fig. 18. It is ebout 5 ft diem
by 8-1/2 £t high from the drain line at the bottom to the center of the
outlet nozzle. The wall thickness of the cylindrical section is 9/16
in.; the top and béttom heads are 1-1/ 8 in. thick. The core contains
approximately 600 vertical graphite bars 2 in. square x 67 in. long.
Most of the bars have grooves 1.2 in. wide x 0.2 in. deep machined along
the full length of each face. The bars are installed with the grooves
on adjacent bars aligned to form chennels 1.2 in. x O.4 in. for the salt
to flow through the core. The graphite is a new type with high strength,
high density, and pore openings averaging about 0.4 microns in diameter.
The salt does not wet the graphite and cennot penetrate through the small
pores unless the pressure 1s raised to 5 to 20 times the normal pressure
in the core.

- Preliminary testing of the MSRE was begun in July, and fuel and
coolent systems were heated for the first time for the prenuclear tésting
in the fall of 1964. The reactor.was first critical in June 1965 and
reached its maximum power of about T.5 Mw(th) in.June 1966. The accumu-
lated operating experience through May 12, 1967, is presented in Table
20. Major activities are shown &s & function of time in Figs. 19 and 20.

In most respects the reactor has performed exceptionally well.
Analyses for corrosion products in the salt indicate that there has been
essentially no corrosion of the Hastelloy N by the salt. Inspection of
some parts of the fuel system confirmed that the corrosion was negligible
during about 1890 hours of circulating salt in prenuclear and critical
tests. Samples removed from the core showed no attack on metal or =
graphite during the 2760 hours of subcritical and power operation from
December 1965 through July 1966. Analyses of the fuel salt for uranium
and reactivity belences indicate that the fuel has been completely stable.

. Although there have been problems with auxiliaries and electrical
systems, few problems have been encountered with the major reactor systems.
The time to reach full power was extended several months by plugging of
small lines in the off-gas system that handles the helium and gaseous
fission products from the pump bowl. The reactor was shut down from mid-
July to mid-October, 1966, by failure of the rotary elements of the
blowers in the heat rejection system. After power operation was resumed
in October, it was interrupted in November and again briefly in January
for work on the off-gas line and on problems associated with monitoring
of the reactor containment. In spite of these interruptions the reactor
was critical 75% of the time--mostly at full power, the fuel system
operated 86% of the time, and the coolant system operated 100% of the
time from mid-October until the reactor was shut down in mid-May, 1967,
to remove graphite and metal specimens from the core. The mejor ineci-
dents are discussed more fully below. : ’

The radiator housing is a large, insulated, electrically heated box
around the radiator coils and is required so the radiator can be kept hot
and the salt in it molten when the reactor is not producing fission heat.
The difficulties were in obtaining proper operation of the doors and in
controlling leakage of hot air through joints end through ducts for elec-
trical leads to prevent overheating of equipment outside the housing.
Future molten-salt reactors are unlikely to have similar radiators, but
the experience will be helpful in designing better furnaces for other
equipment.

The off-gas system was designed for a small flow of gas, essentielly
free of solid or liquid aerosols. Some difficulty was experienced with
micron-size particles of salts collecting in the tiny ports of the flow
. control valves, but much more difficulty was experienced efter the reac-
tor began to operate at 1 Mw with organic solids and viscous organic
liquids collecting in the valves and at the entrance to the carbon beds.

The bearings on the fuel circulation pump are lubricated and parts
of the pump are cooled by oil. The oil is separated from the pump tank
by & rotary seal. Provision is made for directing the normal seal lesk-
age of 1 to 10 cc per dey of oil to a waste tank and preventing liquid
or vapor from coming in contact with the salt or cover gas in the pump tank.
Under special conditions, demonstrated in a pump test loop, this oil can
leek through a gasketed seal in the pump presently in the MSRE and into
the pump tenk where it vaporizes. The vapors mix with the helium purge
stream and flow into the off-gas system. The oil has no effect on the

C

fuel salt, but the organic materials polymerize in the off-gas system

“under the intense bete radiation of the gaseous fission products to form

the viscous liquids and solids that plugged the valves and the entrances
to the carbon beds.

This problem has been reduced to & minor nuisance in the MSRE by
installing absolute filters for trapping solids and heavy liquids ahead
of the control valves. The leakage path has been eliminated in future
pumps by substituting & welded seal for the gasketed seal. Small amounts
of organic and inorganic vapors or aerosols are likely to be found in the
off-gas from future reactors, but they can be easily controlled by the use
of filters, traps, and absorbers. :

- The off-gas line was plugged once by frozen salt. This happened
vhen the pump bowl was accidentally overfilled while the calibration of
the liquid-level indicators was being investigated. Salt was discharged
into some of the lines attached to the pump bowl and froze in the cold
sections. Heaters were applied to the lines to remove most of the salt,
but it was necessary to open the off-gas line and break up.a small amount
of material in part of the line, Careful attention must be given to the
interface between hot systems and cold systems in the breeder designs.

The maximum power reached in the MSRE is 20 to 25% below the design
power. It is limited by the heat transfer performance of the radiator,
but the overall heat transfer coefficient of the primary heat exchanger
is also less than had been calculated. In the case of the radiator the
air-side coefficient is low. While this indicates that better relation-
ships would be useful for calculating the air-side performance of such
devices, the designs for molten-salt breeder reactors do not contain
salt-to-air radiators. Recent date indicate that the equations used to
calculate the performence of the primary heat exchanger were adequate,
but that too high a value was used for the thermal conductivity of the
salt. This points to the need for very good date on the properties of
salts for the breeder reactors.

One day in July, 1966, when the reactor was running at full power,
the power slowly decreased from T.5 Mw to about 5.5 Mw without action

- on the part of the operators, and at the same time the air flow through

the radietor decreased. Investigation soon showed that the reduction in
air flow had resulted from the disintegration of the rotary element on
one of the two axial blowers that operate in parallel to pump air through
the radiator at a rate of about 200,000 f£t3/min., Although the blower was

wrecked, the housing retained most of the fragments. Only some small

pieces were blown. through the ‘radiator and they did no: damage.

The rotary element on the other blover had a large crack in:the hub,
so one blower and the rotary. element of the second had to be replaced.
Tt took about three months to obtain rotary elements with blades that
would pass & thorough examination. The cause for the failures was never
fully established. The blowers with new rotary elements have been
operated for about 8 months with the vibrations and bearing temperatures

. monitored carefully. One bearing on one blower has had to be replaced

 

 
 

 

 

 

T0

to keep the vibrations within specified limits, The rotary elements have \&/
been inspected periodically and show no signs of cracking. While this
incident caused a long shutdown it is unrelated to molten-salt reactor -
technology.

We stated above that the mechanical performance of the MSKE, salt
systems has been excellent, that there has been little or no corrosion
of the container metal and little or no reaction of the salt with the So
graphite, and that the fuel salt has been completely steble. - This is
the performance that the component tests and several years of materials
work and chemicel development prior to the experiment had led us to \
expect. Aside from the experience with polymerization of orgenic materials
in the off-gas system, the only unexpected behavior in the system has been
that of fission products from niobium, atomic number 41, through tellu-
rium, atomic number 52.

These elements were expected to be reduced to metals by the chromium
in the Hastelloy N end by the. trivalent uranium in the salt and to deposit
on metal surfaces in the reactor or to circulate as colloidal particles.
However, they were found in considersble amounts on graphite as well as
on metal specimens that were removed from the core of the reactor in
August 1966. Also there is some evidence of these materiels in the gas
phage sbove the salt in the pump bowl. In the higher valence states,
.most of these elements form volatile fluorides, but the fluorides should
not be able to exist in equilibrium with the fuel sglt. The actual state
of these materials in the MSRE may be exactly what the chemists expected; >
the deposits on the graphite samples may be thin films of metal particles;
and the materials in the gas phase may be serosols instead of volatile
fluoride compounds. More work is required to firmly esteblish the be-
havior of these elements in the MSRE and to relate this behavior to the
conditions of breeder reactors,

tn

In its performance to date the MSRE has fulfilled much of its
original purpose. Continued operation of the reactor now becomes important
in the investigation of details of the technology, of long-term effects,
and of some aspects that were not included in the original plans.

The MSRE is the only large irredietion facility availsble or proposed
for use in the development of molten-salt reactors before the MSBE begins
to operate. It is needed primarily for study of the chemistry of the fuel
salt and the materials. Continued investigation of the mechanism of depo-
sition of fission products on graphite and metel surfaces and of the
. appearance in the gas phase of elements from niobium through tellurium is
essential to the design of molten-salt breeder reactors. This information
will be obtained through studies of the fuel salt » the off-gas from the
pump bowl, and. specimens of graphite and metal that are exposed in the
core and in the liquid and vapor phases in the pump bowl. The core of
the MSRE is the only place where large numbers of specimens can be accom-
modated for this purpose and also for determining the effects of irradi-
ation on metels and graphite in a fuel-salt environment. Since the MSRE —F
- operates at low power density, the effects of power density must be : GO
determined in capsule &nd in circuleting loop experiments in other reactors.
Tl

By having these latter tests complement those in the MSRE the number of
tests and the size and complexity of the test facilities should be con-
siderably reduced. Lo - Lo

Large breeder reactors will use 233 as fuel and in the circulating
reactor the effective delayed neutron fraction will be reduced. to about
0.0013. This is much smaller than has been used in reactors to date
and has important safety and control implications. Plans are to fuel
the MSRE with #23 late in FY-1968 and to investigate the stability of
the reactor when operating with the small delayed neutron fraction.

This will be the first reactor fueled with 22°%y and good agreement
between the calculated and measured stability characteristics will give
confidence in the calculated stability end safety characteristics of
the large breeders. to :

While the above experiments are in progress the longer operation of
the reactor will subject the equipment to additional exposure to radi-
ations and operation at high temperature. Effects observed and experience
with the equipment will provide data helpful in designing the MSBE and
in design studies for larger plants. Experience with the maintenance
and studies of radiation levels and the principal sources will apply
directly to the development of maintenance methods and equipment for
those reactors.

Advances in Technology Required for a
High-Performance Thermal Breeder

Advancing the technology of the MSRE to the level required to build
large, two-fluid, two-region power breeders requires few, if any, major
inventions. It does require considerable research and development to
increase the depth of knowledge in the entire field, to improve materials
and processes, to make larger, better equipment, and to demonstrate a
much higher performance in a combined reactor, processing, and power
plant. ) ;

~The most important difference between the MSRE and the reference
breeder is the power density in the fuel. The maximum power density

in the fuel in the power breeder is expected to be 600 to 1000 kw/liter,
a factor of 20 to 35 ebove the maximum in the MSRE. Results of short-
term in-pile tests of fuel salt and graphite in metal capsules at 250
kw/liter and fuel salts in metel capsules at several thousand kilowatts
per liter indicate that the fuel is steble and compatible with the mate-
rials at the high power density. This compatibility must be more thor-
oughly established by tests of long duration under conditions proposed
for the breeder and, in some instances, under more severe ‘conditions.

A very important part of this effort is to determine the distribution
of fission products in the systems and in particular whether enough of
them deposit on the graphite to seriously affect the breeding potential
of the reactor. Co

\

 
 

 

 

T2

The two-region breeder meskes use of graphite tubes or fuel cells to
keep the fuel salt from mixing with the blenket salt in the reactor Cope.
This graphite will be subjected to & maximum neutron dose of about 1022
nvt (E > 100 kev) in five years at the high power density in the center
of the core. The graphite bars in the MSRE have cracks that would pass
.salt, but with some additional development, tubes or fuel cells could.
almost certainly be made with the same low permeability to salt and free
from cracks. Whether they would survive the large radiation dose is
uncertain because no grephite has yet been irradiated beyond ebout 3 x 102
nvt. A more radiastion-resistant graphite, possibly an isotropic material,
with equally low ‘permeabllity may have to be obtained to get the desired
life.

The Hastelloy N used in the MSRE has excellent properties when un-
irradiated, but the creep properties deteriorate under irradiation. This
behavior occurs in stainless steels and other alloys and is caused by
helium bubbles in the grain boundaries ‘produced by thermal neutron irra-
diation of boron in the alloy. For the reactors to have long life, the
Hastelloy N must be improved to have better high-temperature properties
under irradiation. Research in progress indicates this cen be done, but
a satisfectory improvement must be demonstrated with commercial materials.

The vacuum distillation, protactinium removal, and continuous vola-
‘tility processes for the fuel and blanket salts must be taken through the
laboratory and pilot plant stages.

Equipment for the full-scale breeder plants and for any demonstration
plant will be considerably larger than that in the MSRE. Techniques
developed for building large equipment for other types of reactors will
have to be adapted to the needs of molten-salt reactors. Supercritical
steam generators, salt to steam reheaters, large pumps with long shafts
and molten-salt bearings and new concepts in cover-gas systems must be
developed for the reactors. A continuous fluorinator, & high-temperature
vacuum still, a liquid-metal to molten-salt extraction system and other
new devices are required for the fuel processing plent. Equipment and
techniques must be developed for maintaining larger radioactive equipment
with greater facility. Development of remote welding and inspection of
radioactive systems is expected to be necessary.

A these developments must be combined and the new level of tech-
nology demonstrated in a breeder pilot plant.

Criteria for the Molten-Salt Breeder Experiment
The MSBE should demonstrate all the basic technology of a large
molten-salt breeder reactor so that moderate scale-up and normal improve-
ment of equipment and processes ere all that is required to build large
plants. The plent should be as small end the power level as low as is
consistent with making a complete demonstration. Major criteria for the
plant are the following. :
a

73

{

The average: core power density in the fuel salt in the core should
be at least the 470 w/1iter of the MSBR reference. design.

Fuel, blanket, and coolant salts should be essentially those proposed
for use in the reference reactor. The uranium concentration may be
somewhat higher in the fuel salt in the experiment with the reference
concentration of thorium in the blanket but not so high as to cause
the chemistry to be significantly different. A fuel of the reference
uranium concentration could be demonstrated by reducing the thorium
concentration in the blanket for the demonstration period.

The design of the plent should be similar to that proposed for a
large breeder and the components should be of a size and design that
can reasongbly be scaled up to make components for & prototype. The
core should have graphite tubes or fuel cells with fuel salt in the
tubes and blanket salt around the tubes. Components probably should
be at least one-tenth the size of the components of the reference
design. :

Reactor and coolent systems mst be capable of operating vith the
maximum temperatures and temperature differences.

The reactor should be & breeder with high enough yield to demonstrate
breeding in & reasonable time. Suggested times are one full-power
year for the determinetion based on enalyses of core and blanket
fluids and weights: of fissile material fed to the core and removed
from the blanket and three to five years for a material balance over
the reactor and processing plant.

Methods for processing the fuel ‘and blanket salts should be those
proposed for the reference breeder. Protactinium removal should be
included. Equipment for the processing plant should be of a size
that can be scaled up for the larger plant. Intermittent operation
of the pilot plant would be acceptable to permit use of equipment of
larger size.

Maintenance methods end. Seta, what represent major steps in devel-

opment of equipment -for large power breeders. This probably requires

development of remote velding ‘that might not otherwise be needed in
the pilot plant.

Supercritical steam should be generated : in the- pilot plant and should

be used to produce electricity. This may require a special turbine,

smaller than is normally built for use with supercriticel steam.

} - Results of some preliminary studies suggest that e reactor with a
power level of 100 to 150 Mw(th) would setisfy these criteria. Some

characteristics of pilot plants of several sizes and power levels, but
with an average power density of 470 w/liter in ‘the core, are compared
with those of the reference design and one module of the modular alterna-
tive in Table 21. All the reactors use fuel cells of the same design,

but the number and length vary with core size. Moderator pieces around

the fuel cells are modified to vary the fraction of blanket salt in the

core. The pilot plant would be expected to be a smaller version of the
modular design in having one fuel salt, one blanket salt, and one coolent-
salt circuit to remove the heat generated in the reactor. The comparison
suggests that a 100- to 150-Mw(th) reactor would satisfy the criteria.
For smaller reactors, the fraction of blenket salt in the core becomes
impracticebly small, or the uranium concentration in the fuel salt unde-
sirably high unless the core is made drastically different from the
reference design.

SUMMARY OF PLANS, SCHEDULE, AND COSTS

Molten-Salt Breeder Experiment

The entire program centers about the breeder experiment. A proposed
schedule for the experiment is shown in Table 22. Conceptual design and
planning would begin immediately to provide the design basis for FY-1969
authorization of Title I end part of Title 2 design for a construction
project. Authorization of construction would be requested for FY-1970.
Construction of buildings and services and procurement of major equipment
would begin in FY-19T1, this time being determined by the time required
for parts of the final design and for essential development work. No
construction or procurement would begin until all basic questions of
feasibility were satisfactorily resolved. Prenuclear testing and check-
out of parts of the plant would begin in FY-197h and the plant would

reach full power in 1975.

The - MSBE would be a complete power breeder plant designed to operate
at 100 to 150 Mw(th) and to produce 40 to 60 Mw(e).. The experiment would
contain a reactor and supercritical steam-generating plant, an electrical
generating end distributing plant, a fuel and blanket processing facility
associated with the reactor, waste handling and storage facilities, and
all necessary maintenance equipment. Preliminary estimates of the cost
of the experiment and the startup are presented in Table 23. The plant
costs represent & factor of more than two escalation of costs obtained by
scaling down to the experiment size the estimates for the 1000-Mw(e) MSER
end the 250-Mw(e) module. Ba

Training of — ‘which is done in conjunction with the operation
of the Engineering Test Unit and the Fuel Processing Pilot Plant, and

- startup costs were estimated on the basis of experience with the MSRE and
a variety of processing plants.

Hglrebiag Test Unit end Fuel Processing Pilot Plant

As en important part of ‘the development and testing of equipment, we

‘plan to build end operate a full-scale mockup of the reactor primary system,

coolant system, and fuel &nd blanket processing facility. Equipment
for this plant will be made directly from the early designs of equipment

for the MSBE and will be made of materiels being developed for use in the \’
finel plent. The equipment will be arranged in heated cells of the design °
proposed for the MSBE but the cells will not have heavy concrete walls &nd

will be instelled in an existing building.

Febrication of the equipment will provide manufacturers with their
first experience in making reactor equipment of Hastelloy N and should-
result in much better equipment for the reactor. Operation of the plant
will provide a better test of the equipment, the methods of support, and
the furnaces than would individual tests. Maintenance procedures and
equipment will be tested there also. Operators for the MSBE will receive
much of their training in this test facility. Serious work on the test
plant is planned to begin in the middle of FY-1968 with the goal of having
it in operation by the. end of FY-1971. Operation will end in FY-19Th.

Development of Components and SystemsS

Much of the development and testing of components and systems will be
carried out in conjunction with the Engineering Test: Unit. In addition
there will be extensive design, development, and loop testing of pumps
for the fuel and blanket systems and some work on the coolant pumps.
Relieble pumps are essential to long continuous operation of the reactor, (
and the pumps for the MSER differ considerably from those in use in the
MSRE. Other major activities include development of control rods end
drives, a cover gas recirculation system, mechanical valves for use in -
salt, and parts of furnaces and special coolers. Flow tests will be made
in the ETU and in reactor core models. Heat transfer studies will be
made for the heat exchangers, the steam generator, and the reheater.
Minor testing will be done of components for the steam system and the
salt sampler, and the drain tank cooler systems developed for the MSRE
will be upgraded for use in the MSBE. Models of the pumps, the control
rods, and the cover gas and xenon stripping system will be operated,
solutions to other critical problems will be demonstrated, and critical
parts of the heat transfer and flow tests will be completed in FY-1970.

Instrumentation and Controls Development”

The instrumentation for the MSBE will depend heavily on the experi-
ence with the MSRE. Upgrading of some instruments will be necessary;
there will be considersble testing of the instrument components specified
for use in the MSBE. An ultrasonic flowmeter will be investigated for
measuring the flows of salt in the fuel, blanket, and coolant systems in
the reactor end in the EIU. Development of the control rods and drives
is included under the Component end Systems Development. The instrumen-
tation offers no barriers to the successful construction and operation of
the breeder experiment. :

Materials Development®

‘Demonstration of a graphite satisfactory for the tubes for the core
of the reactor and a Hastelloy N with adequate high-temperature properties
under irradiation for making the equipment and piping are crucial items
in the development for the MSBE, The metals program includes modifying
the present Hastelloy N, testing the resistance to radiation effects, and

~ demonstrating that the improved alloy hes satisfactory corrosion resist-
ance, weldability, fabricability, and compatibility with graphite.

The graphite program includes determining the effects of very large
doses of fast neutrons on the properties of several promising graphites,
developing graphite in tubes with an acceptably high, resistance to radi-
ation effects and low permeebility to salt and gaseous fission products,
and developing a satisfactory method for joining the graphite to metals.
The progrem is aimed at demonstrating before FY-19T1 that these problems
have adequate solutions. A strong continuing program is required in
support of the effort to provide all the Hastelloy equipment and a graph-
ite core for the MSBE. oo

v7 Chemical Research and Development?

Although the fuel salt for the MSBE is similar to the fuel used in
the MSRE and salts similar to the blanket salt have been used in experi-
ments, some studies must be done with salts of the actual compositions
proposed for the MSBE. The proposed coolent salt is new and must be
thoroughly tested. Details. of the phase relationships will be obtained
in the vicinity of the specified compositions. The physical and thermo-
dynamics properties and the behavior of oxides and oxyfluorides in the
salts will be studied in regions of - interest to MSBE operation.

In-pile tests will be run to establish the compatibility of salt,
graphite, and Hastelloy N through long exposures at high power density.
Good knowledge of the distribution of the fission products between the
salt, graphite, and metal surfaces promises to be a very ‘important result
of. these experiments.

X

Studies will be made of protactinium end fission-product chemistry to

provide a better chemical basis for the separations processes. Some work

will be done to improve the. efficiency of the salt preparation processes.

Continuous Knowledge of the composition of the salts, especially
the: fuel salt, is desirable: for running a liquid-fuel reactor. The most
direct way of obtaining this information is through in-line enalysis of
the salts. Effort will be spent on methods which have been partly devel-
oped under other programs and ‘appear to be promising for making the
analyses.

A favorable flssion-prodict distribution and good compatibility of

~ salts, graphite, end Hastelloy N at high power density are essential to

the success of the MSBER as a breeder. e program is planned to pro- oo’
vide definitive dats by the end of FY-1970. *

Fuel end Blanket Processing Developmenti©

The fuel and blanket process development involves converting the
fluoride volatility process from batchwise to continuous operation end
taking the vacuum distilletion and the protactinium removal processes from
the stage of demonstration of basic phenomena in the laboratory to an
engineered plant. This includes developing flowsheets and equipment,
determining effects of operating veriebles, testing the processes in the

laboratory and pilot plants, and testing the final equipment 1 before it.
is installed in the MSEE processing facility.

Demonstration of the continuous fluorinator and the partiel decon-
tamination of fuel salt from the MSRE in a practical vecuum still. are
required before FY-19T71 in order to begin construction of the plent.
Demonstration of the protactinium removal process on & small scale by
that time is desireble and is plenned, but it is not essential. Such a
\ process significantly improves the performance of & molten-salt reactor
as & breeder. It is not a decisive factor in making an ‘MSER competitive
with advenced converter or fast breeder reactors.

Maintenance Development! Co - .

The methods for maintaining much of the radioactive equipment in
the MSBE will be similar to those used in the MSRE. This eliminates the
expensive consideration and investigation of several alternatives, but
considerable development of tools, jigs, and fixtures will be necessary
because their design is closely related to the design of the reactor
equipment. Several techniques new to the molter-salt reactor technology
are proposed to be investigated and some will be developed. One is remote
machining and welding of the main salt piping. A second is the remote
replacement of the graphite structure core. A third is remote machining
and welding of seal welds or closure welds on the cover of the reactor
vessel and on the plenums. A fourth is the remote replacement of the
primary heat exchanger and possibly the plugging of heat exchanger tubes
in place or in & hot cell, depending on the design of the exchanger. The
welding and brazing development is & Joint Materials Development and.
Maintenance Development effort. The program is planned to demonstrate
by the end of FY-1970 the feasibility of making the essentiel joints in
the reactor system by remote brazing or welding or by other methods pro-
posed by the designers. :

Physics Program?
Because the molten-salt breeder reactors are thermal reactors, make 2
use of circulating fuels that are easily adjusted in fissile concentration, <

and are of simple configurations, they do not require an elsborate physics

ak

of fission products from salt under accident conditions and release of
pressure produced by discharge of supercritical steam into the intermediate

81

program. Some work is needed to obtain better cross-section data. Studies
are required of the dynamics characteristics of the reactors and methods
of flattening the power distribution and some development of codes will be
necessary. Physics experiments will consist primarily of a few lattice
substitution measurements in the High-Temperature Lattice Test Reactor

and the Physics Constants Test Reactor at the Pacific Northwest Laboratory.

The program is planned to resolve by FY-1971 all physics questions con-

cerning the performance of molten-salt reactors as breeders. Work after
that time will be mostly concerned with refining the physics calculations
and preparing for the physics experiments associated with startup of the

MSBE.

Safety Progran'®

The studies of safety of. ‘molten-salt reactors have, in the past, been
limited to the safety analysis of the MSRE. A thorough analysis is re-
quired of the safety problems of the large breeder reactors, primarily in
describing potential accidents, their consequences, and methods of pre-
vention. Experimental investigation of specific problems such as release

coolant system will be made when the conditions are properly esteblished
by the enalysis. The analytical work end essential experiments can be
completed easily as the reactor is designed. No problems are presently
foreseen that would lead to serious questioning of the feasibility of
properly containing and safely. operating molten-salt reactor plants.
