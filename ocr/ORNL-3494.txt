ABSTRACT

The removal of uranium hexafluoride from a gas stream containing
uranium hexafluoride and nitrogen by a single layer of sodium fluoride
pellets was investigated. Experimental data on the rate and extent of
sorption were obtained in the temperature range 29 to 100 degrees cen-
tigrade and uranium hexafluoride concentration range 0.57 to 10.9 mole
per cent uranium hexafluoride.

The results of this study indicate that the rate controlling
mechanisms are: transfer of uranium hexafluoride across a stagnant gas
film surrounding the pellet, diffusion of gaseous uranium hexafluoride
in the pores of the pellet, and diffusion of uranium hexafluoride
through a layer of uranium hexafluoride-sodium fluoride complex covering
the unreacted sodium fluoride in the interior of the pellet. The
crystalline density of the complex, UF -2NaF, was determined to be
4.13 grams per cubic centimeter which indicates that incomplete reaction
of the sodium fluoride will occur for pellets in which the initial
volume void fraction is less than 0.807.

A useful model was devised to represent the sorption of uranium
hexafluoride by a single pellet of sodium fluoride, and differential
equations based on the model were written. A general method of solution
of the partial differential equation describing simultaneous diffusion
and irreversible reaction with variable diffusivity and reaction rate
constant was derived for systems in which a steady-state type of
solution is valid. The experimental data were correlated on the basis

of the model with a root-mean-square error of 9.5 per cent for all
iv
points. The resulting computer code and associated data may be used

for design of sorber systems such as fixed and moving beds.

CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION

The study reported here concerns the determination of the rate
controlling mechanisms for the removal of uranium hexafluoride from
flowing streams of uranium hexafluoride in nitrogen by cylindrical
pellets (one-eighth-inch right circular) of sodium fluoride.

Uranium hexafluoride reacts reversibly with sodium fluoride to
form a solid complex. The reversible character of the reaction makes
it attractive as a means for separating uranium hexafluoride from other
gases and/or as an alternative to low-temperature cold trapping for
collecting uranium hexafluoride.

An important application of the uranium hexafluoride -sodium
fluoride system is in the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Fluoride
Volatility Process for recovery of uranium from irradiated nuclear
fuels. During the final step of the process, a molten fluoride salt
containing dissolved uranium tetrafluoride and fluorides of fission
products and corrosion products is contacted with gaseous elemental
fluorine at 500 to 600°C (degrees centigrade). The gas stream leaving
the fluorinator consists of a mixture of uranium hexafluoride, unreacted
fluorine, fission product fluorides, and corrosion product fluorides.
Differences in the decomposition pressures of the fluorides that form
sodium fluoride complexes are exploited during alternate sorption and
desorption of the uranium hexafluoride in fixed beds of sodium fluoride

to produce a uranium hexafluoride product of high purity.
2

Information on the effects of various system parameters on the
rate of sorption is needed so that sodium fluoride sorbers may be
designed for a wide range of operating conditions..

In this study, a determination was made of the rate-controlling
steps in the sorption of uranium hexafluoride from a stream of uranium
hexafluoride and nitrogen by sodium fluoride in the form of one-eighth-
inch right circular cylindrical pellets at atmospheric pressure. The
temperature range covered was 29 to 100°C; the uranium hexafluoride

concentration range was 0.57 to 10.9 mole per cent.

A discussion of the pertinent information from the literature is given

below.

Uranium Hexafluoride-Sodium Fluoride System

The reaction of uranium hexafluoride with sodium fluoride was

noted first by Ruff and Heinzelman in 1911.

50 Grosse in 194120 reported

that hydrogen fluoride was necessary for the reaction, which resulted
L
in the formation of a ternary complex. Subsequent study of the complex
formed in the temperature range 30 to 100°C by Martin et al. in 19512
showed the composition UF -5NaF and indicated decomposition of the
complex at 450°C yielding uranium hexafluoride and fluorine. It was
also concluded that the presence of hydrogen fluoride is not necessary
for obtaining a reaction between uranium hexafluoride and sodium
fluoride.

Cathers et al. in 195712 studied the formation and decomposition
reactions of the complex and concluded that the reaction involved an
equilibrium between gaseous uranium hexafluoride, solid sodium fluoride,
and the solid complex which was given the formula UF *5NaF although it
was noted that some preparations had a composition nearer to 2UF ;*5NaF.
The decomposition pressure of the complex was measured in the tempera-

ture range 80 to 360°C and conformed to the equation
log), Pp = 10.88 - 5.09 x 10°/T 5 (2)

where

I]

P decomposition pressure in millimeters mercury,

T = temperature in degrees Kelvin.
Use of the Clausius-Clapeyron relation with the decomposition pressure
relation yielded the heat of sorption for the complex: -23.2 kilocal-
ories per mole. A study was made of the rate of decomposition by two
alternative reactions reported by Martin et al., the first of which was

found to yield fluorine and a white complex in which uranium had the

valence of plus five, and a subsequent reaction which was found to yield

7
>
a green complex in which uranium had the valence of plus four, the
result of the liberation of additional fluorine. Based on the rate
constant for the first decomposition reaction, these reactions can be
neglected in the present study in which the temperature range is below
100°C.

Worthington ‘in 1957%3

studied the rate of reaction between pure
gaseous uranium hexafluoride (at a pressure of fifty-six millimeters of
mercury) and finely divided sodium fluoride in the temperature range

80 to 150°C. No estimates of particle size or surface area were given.
At a given temperature, the reaction followed the logarithmic rate law.
The final composition contained slightly more uranium than would corre-
spond to the formula UF 5NaF. The average rate increased with tempera-
ture up to 130°C, after which a marked decrease was observed. In view
of the experimental method used (admission of uranium hexafluoride to
an evacuated chamber containing a thin layer of sodium fluoride), the
temperature control of the sample was undoubtedly poor in the early
stages of sorption; it is believed that this is the origin of the
decrease in average reaction rate above 130°C.

The rate of reaction between pure uranium hexafluoride at ninety
millimeters mercury pressure and sodium fluoride in the form of powder,
crushed pellets, and pellets was investigated by Massoth et al. in
1958°7 in the temperature range 24 to 68°C. The reaction with powder
having a surface area of 0.33 square meters per gram followed the para-

bolic law after a loading of 0.6 grams of uranium hexafluoride per gram

of sodium fluoride had been established. Insufficient data were
6
available to establish the rate law at lower loadings.

The reaction with crushed pellets followed the logarithmic law
until the loading reached 1.9 grams of uranium hexafluoride per gram of
sodium fluoride, after which reaction in accord with the parabolic law
was observed. It was concluded that the thickness of the film of com-
plex at the onset of the parabolic law was the same in both cases, based
on measurement of the particle size of the materials. An increase in
reaction rate was observed as the sorption temperature was raised for
both powdered sodium fluoride and crushed pellets. The data on the
sorption rate with whole pellets (one-eighth-inch right circular
cylinders) scattered badly and few conclusions can be drawn. A rapid
initial reaction was observed, after which sorption stopped at a loading
of about one gram of uranium hexafluoride per gram of sodium fluoride.
An inverse effect of temperature on the maximum loading was noted.

33

Studies in progress by Katz”~ with sodium fluoride powder having
a surface area of 7.0 square meters per gram show that the composition
of the complex is UF “2NaF. It is believed that the lower extent of
reaction noted in previous studies with low-surface-area powders was
due to the buildup of a thick film of complex on the outside of the
individual particles. This film was five to ten times as thick as the

film on the higher surface area material and caused a low rate of

sorption.

Uptake of Gases by Solids
The uptake of gases by solids may be divided into two types:

that of adsorption, where the gas is retained on the surface of the
7

solid, and that of sorption wherein the interior of a nonporous solid

is penetrated. Study of adsorption, both theoretically and experimen-
tally, has been widespread, while only rudimentary data are available on
the somewhat more complicated process of sorption. :

Adsorption is further divided into physical (van der Waals)
adsorption and activated adsorption (chemisorption). In physical
adsorption the adsorbed gas is held at the solid surface by relatively
weak forces comparable to van der Waals forces in a gas. This type of
adsorption is similar to the condensation of a pure vapor in that in
both processes the rate is almost instantaneous. A second similarity
is that the quantity of heat released on adsorption is approximately
the latent heat of vaporization (five to ten kilocalories per mole) of
the adsorbing material. Also, physical adsorption is observed only at
temperatures near or below the boiling point of the adsorbing material,
whereas chemisorption commonly occurs at temperatures far above the
boiling point of the material being adsorbed.

Chemisorption more closely resembles chemical reaction ‘than con-
densation. The bonding forces between the gas and the solid are
normally stronger than those in physical adsorption; this is reflected
in the heat of adsorption, which is usually greater than ten kilocal-
ories per mole but less than the heat of reaction for typical chemical
reactions, which is about one hundred kilocalories per mole. Chemi-
sorption normally proceeds at a rate which is lower than that of
physical adsorption, and in most cases, an activation energy is observed

as in most chemical reactions.
8

Adsorption normally results in the deposition of a monolayer or,
at most, a few molecular layers of the adsorbing gas whereas sorption
often results in complete reaction of the original solid. As pointed
out by Cabrera et al.,’ if the lattice constants of the reacting solid
and the solid product differ by more than about ten per cent, cracking
and degradation of the product film may occur. McBain’ L discusses
numerous examples where an initially crystalline material is reduced to
a powder during sorption of a gas or liquid. Katz) observed that the
sorption of approximately three moles of hydrogen fluoride per mole of
sodium fluoride results in complete disintegration of the pellets with
a tenfold increase in surface area. It is believed that sorption of
hydrogen fluoride results in a decrease in the size of the initially
crystalline particles originally in the pellet.

‘Most of the data on the rate of sorption of gases by finely
divided solids can be represented by one of three common relations: the
linear law, the parabolic law, and the logarithmic law. The linear law,
which predicts a constant rate of reaction for slab geometry, is
observed in cases where the sorption rate is controlled by the rate of
reaction be tween the reacting solid and gas. The parabolic law predicts
that the rate of sorption is inversely proportional to the thickness of
reaction product through which the gas must diffuse. The parabolic rate
is thus independent of reaction rate and is the rate of diffusion of
reactant.

The logarithmic law, known also as the Elovich equation, is less

well understood. Since the sorption of uranium hexafluoride by sodium
9

fluoride was observed to follow this law, it will be considered in
greater detail. Numerous attempts have been made to provide a theoret-
ical basis for the law, which states that the sorption rate decreases
exponentially with the quantity sorbed. Evans in 194322 derived the
logarithmic rate law in consideration of the rate of oxidation of zinc
where cracking of the oxide layer was believed to occur. This mechanism
is believed to be applicable to the sorption of uranium hexafluoride on
sodium fluoride and will be discussed in Chapter III. Taylor in 1952”7
derived the logarithmic law for chemisorption leading to a monolayer.
He assumed that a certain number of active sites are produced at the
onset of sorption, that the sorption rate is proportional to the number
of active sites, and that the number of active sites decays bimolecu-

>T

larly. Trapnell in 1955 showed that a logarithmic law would be
followed if the activation energy increased linearly with the degree

of surface coverage for a monolayer buildup if the coverage is not near
completion. The uranium hexafluoride loading due to a monolayer of
uranium hexafluoride on sodium fluoride of the type used in this study
is 0.004 gram of uranium hexafluoride per gram of sodium fluoride, which
is approximately one per cent of the loading which is observed. For
this reason, these derivations of the logarithmic law are not considered
pertinent to the present discussion. Freund in 1957° examined data

for the sorption of hydrogen on various oxides and found good agreement
between values of constants in the logarithmic law determined experimen-

tally and values calculated from a relation obtained by Sutherland et al.

in 195372 for the case in which the rate of sorption was controlled by
10
35

Knudsen flow in a porous material. Landsberg in 1955 reviewed the
literature on the logarithmic rate law for chemisorption and the oxida-
tion of metals. and gave a derivation of the law. The assumption was
made that the rate of adsorption was proportional to the surface density
of adsorption sites which were initially present or were generated
during sorption by such processes as the diffusion of adsorbed material
away from the surface. Although the basic idea on which the derivation

is based is certainly plausible, its use is limited by its indefinite

nature.

Diffusion of Gases Through Porous Solids

Gases may be transported through porous solids by bulk diffusion,
Knudsen diffusion, or a combination of the two. Bulk diffusion occurs
in a pore when the mean free path of the diffusing gas molecules is
small compared to the radius of the pore, so that in most collisions
the gas molecule collides with another gas molecule. When the mean free
path of the diffusing gas molecule is the same as or larger than the
radius of a pore, the gas molecule will collide more often with the
pore wall than with other gas molecules, and Knudsen diffusion will
occur. As discussed in Chapter III, only bulk diffusion is believed
important in this study.

The effective diffusivity of a gas being transported within a
porous solid by a diffusive mechanism is less than the normal diffu-
sivity of the gas. Numerous efforts have been made to relate the ratio

of effective diffusivity to normal diffusivity and characteristics of
11
the porous solid. Maxwell in 18730 considered the solid to be composed

of uniform spheres and obtained the relation:

 

D
5 = 3 == ’ (2)
where
D, = effective diffusivity,
D = normal diffusivity, \
€ = volume void fraction.

Bruggeman in 1935° extended the range of validity of Maxwell's expres-
sion to higher values of ¢ by the use of a continuum model which yielded

the result:

“lo

= 32, k (3)

Buckingham in 190k, on the basis of data on the rate of diffu-
sion of oxygen and carbon dioxide through soil, suggested the relation

D :
SS = (k)
Masamune in 1962,38 working with large pore silver catalysts in which
only bulk diffusion was present, found that the Buckingham relation
represented the data better than the Maxwell or the Bruggeman relations.

58

Wakao in 1962” derived an expression for the effective diffusivity in

a solid containing both macro- and micropores; it reduces to Equation
(4) for the case of bulk diffusion in macropores. Currie in 1960°
measured the rate of diffusion of hydrogen through a number of materials

in which the void fraction ¢ varied from 0.18 to 0.98 and recommended

the relation:
12

D, = 7¢" , y<1l, n>1, (5)

where y and n are characteristic of a given material.

Petersen in 19580 considered the effect of periodic pore con-
strictions (such as in pelleted or extruded porous solids) on the effec-
tive diffusivity. The pore model assumed was a hyperbola of revolution
giving a pore constriction at the vertex of the hyperbola. The solution
to the steady-state diffusion equation for a pore of this shape was
found at different values of B, the ratio of the maximum to minimum
cross section of the pore. Comparison of the rate of diffusion in this
type pore and in an equivalent cylindrical pore showed that the normal
diffusivity was reduced by a factor of three when f had a value of

twenty-five.

Simultaneous Diffusion and Irreversible Reaction

The process in which a substance diffuses into a rigid medium
with which it reacts irreversibly is encountered in many fields and has
consequently received considerable study. In the most general form of
the problem, the rate of sorption of the reacting substance depends on
both the rate of diffusion of the substance in the medium (or in the
product of reaction between the reacting substance and the medium) and
the rate of reaction between the diffusing substance and the medium.
One may also have the added complication that the point values of
diffusivity and the rate of reaction are dependent on the quantity of
the substance that has reacted at the point. To date, an analytical

solution yielding the rate of sorption and associated information has
13

not been found for the general problem. A number of solutions, both
analytical and numerical, have been obtained for special cases of the
general problem and will be discussed below. Most of these solutions
are of a steady-state nature; that is, the rate of sorption does not
include the time rate of change of the total quantity of unreacted
substance in the medium. These solutions result from solution of the
appropriate form of the general diffusion equation and can be grouped
according to reaction rate and diffusivity in the following manner:

1. Instantaneous reaction, constant diffusivity.

2. Instantaneous reaction, variable diffusivity.

5. Variable reaction rate, constant diffusivity.

In the first type of solution, distinguished by an instantaneous
reaction rate and constant diffusivity, the rate of sorption of the
reacting substance is controlled solely by the rate of diffusion of
reactant through the reacted portion of the medium to the reaction
interface, which is of infinitesimal thickness and separates the region
in which complete reaction with the medium has occurred from the region
in which no reaction has occurred. This type of solution was first
investigated by Hill in 1929°7 in the study of the diffusion of oxygen
and lactic acid in muscle tissue. Other investigations of this type
include the work of Hermans in: 194720 on the diffusion of sulphide ions
into a gel containing heavy metal ions, and of the work of Booth in
1948° who derived the condition for the existence of a steady-state
type of solution for slab geometry. Crank in 195757 showed that the

agreement between the actual solution and the steady state approximation
14
was dependent on the ratio s/c, where S is the capacity of the medium
for the reacting substance and C is the concentration of the reacting
substance in the fluid adjacent to the medium. For values of S/C
greater than ten, results calculated from the steady-state solution
agree to within one per cent of results from the actual solution for
plane, cylindrical, and spherical geometries. Kawasaki et al. in

1962, >"

and Scott in 1962, °L encountered this type solution in the

reduction of pellets of iron oxide and copper oxide, respectively, by

hydrogen and carbon monoxide. In these two studies, the diffusional

process was that of counterdi ffusion of reactant and product gases;

however, this does not change the characteristics of the solution.
The second type of solution, distinguished by instantaneous

3

reaction and variable diffusivity, was studied by Olofsson in 1956

and in 1960" in the study of uptake of periodate ions by cellulose

fibers. The change of diffusivity with time was attributed to swelling

of the fiber, and a sharp reaction interface was observed, as in the
first type of solution.

The third type of solution, distinguished by variable reaction
rate and constant diffusivity, is used widely in the field of hetero-
geneous. catalysis for the prediction of catalyst activity, selectivity
and other properties. In this type of solution, one or more reactants
and products penetrate the catalyst particle by diffusion through the

‘pore space in the particle to a depth dictated by the relative rates of
diffusion and reaction. A constant value of the diffusivity of

reactants and products is observed since the gross structure of the
15

catalyst is unchanged by the occurrence of a reaction on the pore walls.
The variability of reaction rate in the catalyst particle is caused by
the dependence of the rate upon the concentration of the reactants.
Hence, in the third type of solution, the reaction zone may be
restricted to a narrow region near the surface of the particle if the
reaction rate is high compared with the diffusion rate, or, the reaction
may occur throughout the entire particle if the reaction rate is low
compared with the diffusion rate.

The third type of solution was investigated by Thiele in 1939.77
He obtained an analytical solution for slab geometry with first- and
second-order reactions, and for spherical geometry with first-order

7

reaction. Danckwerts in 1957" obtained the general solution for first-
order reaction in various simple geometries, of which the Thiele treat-
ment is a special case. The Thiele treatment has been used widely in
catalysis by Wheeler in 19518° and in 1955, 61 by Bokhoven et al. in
1951, * by Barnett et al. in 1961° and by numerous other investigators.

A similar type of solution was also obtained by Ausman et al. in 1962!
for. the burning of carbon from the internal surfaces of a porous cata-
lyst pellet where the burning rate was assumed to be first order with
respect to oxygen concentration. The Thiele concept has been extended
to nonisothermal conditions by Tinkler et al. in 196170 and by Carberry

in 1961.10

Mass Transfer to the External Surface of the Pellet
The resistance to mass transfer of a component from a fluid

stream to the surface of a solid particle in a fixed bed is normally
16

considered to be the resistance to diffusion across a hypothesized
stagnant film of fluid surrounding the particle. The rate of transfer
per unit. area is assumed to be given by the product of a mass transfer
coefficient and the concentration difference across the film. Many
investigations have been made for determining the dependence of the mass
transfer coefficient on factors characterizing the fluid, the solid, and
the flow conditions.

Almost all mass transfer data are correlated on the basis of the
j factor originated by Chilton and Colburn in 1934 LH which is defined
in terms of the mass transfer coefficient and physical properties of
the system. The correlation of j factor as a function of Reynolds
number is observed to consist of two straight line portions that inter-
sect at values of the Reynolds number from 50 to 150. Most investi-
gators are in agreement for the line representing Reynolds number
greater than 150, and since the values of the Reynolds number in this

!

study are considerably lower than fifty, only investigations pertinent
to the low Reynolds number range will be discussed. Obtaining accurate
mass transfer data in this range is difficult, particularily for
Reynolds numbers lower than five, owing to effects such as backmixing,
free convection, and axial diffusion. These problems and others
specific to the systems used for obtaining mass transfer data have
resulted in wide discrepancies between the results of individual inves-
tigators and disagreement as to the factors on which the mass transfer
coefficient is dependent. For example, Hurt in 1943, 5t Resnick et al.

in 1949, 49 and Bar-Ilan et al. in 19572 noted an effect of particle

jo}

»
17

size greater than the dependence afforded by inclusion of the particle
diameter in the Reynolds number, while other investigators show only the
variation accounted for by the Reynolds number. Examination of these
studies suggests an effect of particle size for particles less than four
millimeters in diameter; this effect becomes increasingly important as
the particle size is reduced.

Another area of inconsistency is in the definition of the proper

Reynolds number for use in fixed-bed studies. Most investigators use

DG
Neo = -— , (6)
where
Dy = particle diameter,
G = superficial mass flow rate,

pi = viscosity of fluid.

25 Dryden et al. in 1953, 2° and Carberry

36

However, Gaffney et al. in 1950,
in 19607 defined Reynolds number as D G/ue, while Lynch et al. in 1959
" used D,G/u(1-¢)- "Other differences are observed in the recommended
power dependence of the Reynolds number and the Schmidt number.

Carberry in 1960° derived an expression for mass transfer in
fixed beds on the basis of boundary layer considerations which agrees
well with the results of a number of investigations. This relation
shows a direct dependence of the transfer coefficient on fluid velocity,
which is not present in the Chilton-Colburn correlation.

7

Gupta and Thodos in 1962° examined existing data on mass

transfer in fixed beds for both gases and liquids as the fluid phase
18

and recommended the following relation:

€ ip = 0.010 + i ane (7)

Nee - 0.483
DG
for Npe = —£— greater than one, with the mass transfer factor being
defined as
k P_M

ip 5 (Ng); (8)

This relation was used in the present study, although resistance to
mass transfer across the stagnant film is important only during the

early stages of sorption.
19

CHAPTER III

MATHEMATICAL MODEL

The over-all process of removal of uranium hexafluoride from a

flowing stream of uranium hexafluoride in nitrogen by a pellet of sodium

fluoride is believed to involve some or all of the following processes:

1.

The movement of uranium hexafluoride from the gas stream to
the external surface of the pellet, which is commonly
depicted as the transfer of uranium hexafluoride across a
stagnant nitrogen film surrounding the pellet.

The diffusion of gaseous uranium hexafluoride through
nitrogen in the pores of the pellet.

The diffusion of gaseous uranium hexafluoride through a
cracked or broken layer of complex on the internal surfaces
of the pellet.

The adsorption of gaseous uranium hexafluoride on a thin
layer of complex adhering to the underlying sodium fluoride.
The diffusion of adsorbed uranium hexafluoride across the
adherent layer to underlying sodium fluoride.

The reaction of uranium hexafluoride with sodium fluoride

below the complex layer.

Any model proposed to represent the over-all sorption process

must take into account those steps whose rates are of the same order of

magnitude as the rate of the over-all process. The model must also

account for effects resulting from deposition of complex in the pores
20
of the pellet.

.The most striking characteristic of the system under study is the
effect of temperature on the rate and on the extent of reaction between
uranium hexafluoride and sodium fluoride. As noted in the previous
section, for reaction between uranium hexafluoride and powdered sodium
fluoride, an increase in temperature over the range 29 to 100°C results
in an increase in the rate of reaction and the extent of reaction at a

39

specific time. However, as noted by Massoth et al., and from the
results of the present study, there is an inverse effect of temperature
on the maximum extent of the reaction of the sodium fluoride pellets
with uranium hexafluoride.

An explanation of this anomalous effect of temperature on the
rate and extent of sorption for finely divided sodium fluoride and for
sodium fluoride pellets is based on the combination of two ideas. The
first idea is that the temperature dependence of most chemical reactions

and of solid-phase diffusion is of the form ¢ “E/RT

, whereas the tempera-
. : : 3/2

ture dependence of bulk diffusion of gases is of the form . At some
temperature, a given increase in temperature will increase the point

reaction rate by a greater amount than the point rate of bulk diffusion.
The second idea is that, based on measurement of the crystalline density
of the complex, the pores of a pellet will be closed with complex before
complete reaction of the sodium fluoride can occur. (A maximum reaction

of thirty-three per cent of the sodium fluoride was calculated for the

present pellets.)
21

In order to clearly depict the condition outlined above, consider
a sphere of sodium fluoride at a high temperature where the local rate
of reaction of gaseous uranium hexafluoride is high compared with the
rate of diffusion of gaseous uranium hexafluoride through the pores of
the pellet. Under these conditions, the concentration profile of
gaseous uranium hexafluoride would extend into the sphere only a short
distance, and when the pores at the surface have been closed by the
formation of complex, there will be only a thin layer of complex at the
outer surface of the sphere. On the other hand, at a low temperature,

where the rate of reaction is low compared with the rate of diffusion,

‘the radial concentration profile of gaseous uranium hexafluoride is

practically constant, and when the pores are filled at the surface of
the sphere, the pores at the center of the pellet will also be filled.
In the latter case, a larger loading will result due to the formation
of complex within the interior of the pellet in addition to that at the
surface.

In order to test the hypotheses discussed above it is necessary
to derive the general equation for diffusion with chemical reaction
allowing for variable diffusivity and variable reaction rate.

The following assumptions will be made in order to make the

problem more tractable:

1. The pellet is a sphere having a volume equal to the one-
eighth-inch right circular cylindrical pellets used in the
study.

2. The pellet is homogeneous.
22
Radial symmetry.
The temperature variation in the pellet is negligible.
Radial transfer of uranium hexafluoride in the pellet occurs
as diffusion of gaseous uranium hexafluoride through an inert
gas in the pores of the pellet.
The decomposition pressure of the complex is negligible.
The local rate of reaction between gaseous uranium hexa-

fluoride and unreacted sodium fluoride is of the form:

4 - pq, 1) C. (9)

The local effective diffusivity for diffusion in the pores of
the pellet is of the form:

D, = D (qa, T). : (10)

Consider a spherical shell of thickness dr which has the condi-

tions noted at the two surfaces of the shell in Figure 1

From a material balance on the shell,

desired relation, which is:

In order to complete the definition of the mathematical model, one must
specify relations for ¢, D,, and B.
A linear relation was assumed between ¢ and q which was

25

where

m

maximum loading of uranium hexafluoride based on density of
complex and initial void fraction of pellet.

In order to choose the form of D,, one must first characterize
the type of diffusion occurring in the pores of the pellet which could
be bulk, Knudsen, or a combination of the two. The median pore radius
for the unreacted pellets is 6780 angstroms (Appendix E) and the mean
free path (Appendix D) of a uranium hexafluoride molecule in a mixture
of uranium hexafluoride and nitrogen in the present study. is approxi-
mately 300 angstroms. Based on cylindrical pores, the pore radius will
be three times the mean free path when the loading is ninety-eight
per cent of the maximum loading. On this basis, diffusion through the

pores of the pellet will be assumed to be of the bulk type, with D, of

the form
n
where
D. = diffusivity of uranium hexafluoride in nitrogen,
UFg-N,
¢ = void fraction,
7, n = constants.

The form of the point rate of reaction of uranium hexafluoride
remains to be specified. The uranium hexafluoride-sodium fluoride
complex occupies a volume three and one-half times as great as the

volume of the sodium fluoride consumed in its production. Thus, when
26
freshly formed, a film of complex will be in a state of lateral compres-
sion. Although the film adjacent to the sodium fluoride may adhere to
and be braced by the underlying crystalline material, where the film is
not braced by this contact it will yield to the compressional stresses
by cracking and buckling. This yielding will almost certainly result
in flaw paths or zones of loose structure suited for easy transfer of
a diffusing gas. One might thus consider the sodium fluoride to be
covered by two types of films: a thin, tightly packed layer in contact
with the sodium fluoride, which will be of constant thickness, covered
by a broken layer that increases in thickness as sorption proceeds.
Transfer of uranium hexafluoride across the inner layer will be by
diffusion through a crystalline structure. This transfer is slow,
compared with diffusion through gases, and, as pointed out by Jost, 2
is normally an activated type of diffusion. The rate of transfer of
uranium hexafluoride through a break in the outer layer may thus be
independent of the thickness of the outer film and dependent only on
the rate of transfer across the inner layer. If all of the cracks in
the outer layer traversed the entire thickness of the layer, the rate
of sorption would be independent of the film thickness, once the thick-
ness exceeded the thickness of the inner layer. Practically, however,
some paths will be obstructed and no transfer can occur along these.
The rate of transport will be determined by the number of paths that
remain unobstructed at any given thickness.

If one defines as pdx the probability that an obstruction will

occur in the portion of a path contained in a film thickness dx, then

23
27

the probability that a given path be unobstructed will be e P*, The
number of unobstructed paths per unit area of film will thus be in
proportion to e P*. As shown in Figure 2, if C is the uranium hexa-
fluoride concentration in the gas adjacent to the outer surface, the
average concentration at the plane dividing the two films will be

ke P¥c, where k is a constant. The concentration of uranium hexafluo-
ride will be zero where the inner film contacts the sodium fluoride.
The rate of transfer of uranium hexafluoride per unit volume of pellet

is then

dq _ dc
at = DSPyar ax (19)

The form of D for activated diffusion is

D =D o~E/RT

If the thickness of the inner layer is small compared with that of the

and Equation (20) can be written as

A second derivation of Equation (22) is possible based on
slightly different ideas. In this derivation, the unreacted sodium
fluoride is considered to be covered by only the broken layer of complex
of the previous case. As before, the average concentration of uranium
hexafluoride at the sodium fluoride surface is k e P°C. The rate of

reaction per unit area will be assumed to be of the form
Rate = k_ ¢E/RT ,

where k is a constant. The rate of reaction per unit volume of pellet
30

is then

dq _ -E/RT px
ic = k e SPNaF ke” C.

With the definition that
tr _ k
a ko SPyap Ko
and the previous definition for b, one obtains the rate equation

- at o~E/RT _-ba

as

which is of the same form as Equation (22). In the first derivation,

a resistance to reaction is afforded by the adherent layer of complex,

whereas, in the second case a resistance to reaction is afforded by the
rate of chemical reaction. While only two interpretations of Equation
(22) have been given, it is probable that others exist.

Since Equation (16) involves variable coefficients of a rather
complex form, the possibility of achieving an analytical solution is
limited. In such a case, the normal procedure is that of performing
the desired integration by a simple, explicit finite-difference tech-
nique. However, as noted by DuFort and Frankel," if the range in time
for which a solution is required is of the order of the time required
for effective diffusion through the distance NAx, the stability crite-
rion requires that the number of time intervals be of the order N
squared. Cases requiring a moderately fine spatial division lead to
impractically large amounts of computer time, even for large computers
comparable to the IBM-T090 computer. More complicated explicit differ-
encing techniques using two or more time rows or various implicit

techniques have been developed for relaxing the stringent stability
31
, 23 . .
requirements. Since it was not clear that use of one of these methods
would result in a practical time increment (approximately ten seconds
or greater), an alternative method of solution was sought. Desirable
characteristics for such a system include complete stability and freedom
to determine the degree of convergence in order to minimize the amount

of computer time required for solution of the differential equation.
32
CHAPTER IV

| METHOD OF SOLUTION OF SIMULTANEOUS DIFFUSION
AND REACTION EQUATION

As Crank pointed out, in a medium in which a substance is under-
going simultaneous free diffusion and instantaneous irreversible reac-
tion, the concentration profile of unreacted material closely resembles
a steady-state profile when s/c is greater than ten, where § is the
capacity of the medium for the reacting material, and C is the concen-
tration of the unreacted material in the fluid adjacent to the medium.
In the present study, values of s/c range from 1000 to 14,000; however,
the condition of instantaneous rate of reaction is not completely
satisfied.

Another statement of the same idea is that the capacity of the
pores for the accumulation of uranium hexafluoride in gaseous form is
negligible when compared with their capacity for uranium hexafluoride
in the form of the complex. In the present case, the maximum capacity
of the initial void space is 0.03 per cent of that of the solid material
in the pellet. Since the term on the left of the left of equation (16)
represents the accumulation of gaseous uranium hexafluoride in the
pores of the pellet, one is justified in neglecting this term so that
equation (16) becomes the ordinary differential equation:

2 dD
ac 2,1 _e d€ 8B ¢.0, (23)

which defines a steady-state profile dependent only on values of 8 and

D,- As was the case for equation (16), this equation cannot be solved
33

easily by analytical methods. A method will be developed for effecting
the solution to Equation (23).

Consider a sphere that has been divided into N spherical shells
in each of which B and D, have constant values. Since 8 and D, can
vary from shell to shell, one is approximating the true radial variation
of these functions by a series of step changes. Within shell m,

Equation (23) reduces to:

Denote by R the outer radius of the nt? spherical shell. If one
specifies the 3N values of D » ko and R, for the original sphere (which
consists of N shells) one has specified the rate of reaction in the
sphere. It is desired to calculate this rate of reaction.
If one denotes the center shell, which is actually a sphere, as
shell one and specifies the boundary conditions,
Cy is finite at r = 0,

one obtains the concentration profile of unreacted uranium hexafluoride

The remaining shells have common boundary conditions which are,

The relations given by Equations (40), (41), (44), and (45) may
be used in a finite-difference manner for calculating the rate of
reaction, the total quantity which has reacted at a given time, and
other similar quantities. The time increment for any given time inter-

val can be chosen such that the maximum change in the value of B or D,

 
39

is some prescribed fraction of its present value. In this manner, the
degree of convergence from a time increment basis can be chosen at will.
Similarily, since the method is completely stable, one can choose the
degree of convergence on a distance increment basis. In this manner,
one can calculate approximate values of parameters with the expenditure
of a small amount of computer time and improve the degree of convergence
when the values for the parameters are approximately equal to the
required values.

The convergence of the numerical method was examined (Appendix

F) for the case of B and D, of the form:

. MATERTALS AND EQUIPMENT

Materials

The sodium fluoride used in these tests was in the form of com-
pacted right circular cylinders and was part of a shipment of commercial-
grade sodium fluoride from the Harshaw Chemical Company. The material
was prepared by a two-step process consisting of the compaction of
powdered sodium bifluoride followed by heating to approximately 300°C
in air for removing the hydrogen fluoride. A material having a surface
area of about one square meter per gram and a void fraction of 0.35 to
0.50 is produced. Typically, this material has the composition shown
in Table XII (Appendix E) and consists of a mixture of whole and broken
pellets (Figure 3).

Repeated sorption of uranium hexafluoride followed by desorption
at LOO°C in fluorine results in an initial reduction in capacity for
uranium hexafluoride of about thirty-five per cent. During continued
cyclical operation, the capacity increases slowly and approaches that
of pellets treated at 400°C in fluorine for one hour, which is about
five per cent less than the capacity of "as-received" pellets. The
initial variation in pellet capacity due to cyclical operation is within
that observed between different lots of commercial pellets.

The pellets used in this study were fluorinated at L00°C for one
hour prior to use. The material had a surface area (determined by

nitrogen adsorption) of 0.86 square meter per gram, and a void fraction

of 0.45. The mean pore size was 6780 angstroms. A porogram for this
material, together with other pertinent information is presented in
Appendix E.

The nitrogen used in the study had been oil pumped and was dried
in a Drierite column prior to use.

The uranium hexafluoride used in this study was obtained from
the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant and contained less than 200 parts
per million of volatile impurities the most of which was hydrogen
fluoride.

The fluorine used for conditioning the sodium fluoride and
various parts of the experimental apparatus was obtained in gaseous
form from the. Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant. Prior to use, the gas
was passed through a bed of sodium fluoride at room temperature for

removal of hydrogen fluoride.

Equipment

A flow diagram for the equipment used in this study is shown in
Figure 4. Basically, the equipment provided means for preparing gas
mixtures of the desired composition at a controlled flow rate, means
for controlling the temperature of the gas mixture and the sorption
vessel, and means for a second determination of the flow rate of the
two gases used.

The flow rate of uranium hexafluoride was set by maintaining a
controlled pressure drop across a calibrated capillary. The nitrogen

was metered through a rotameter from a constant-pressure nitrogen

the gas preheater which consisted of a coil of three-eighths-inch tubing
fifty feet in length. The preheated gas then flowed through the sorp-
tion vessel and through a sodium fluoride trap for removal of uranium
hexafluoride which passed through the sorption vessel. Both the gas
preheater and the sorption vessel were immersed in an agitated oil bath
that was controlled to within 0.1°C of the desired operating tempera -
ture. After removal of the uranium hexafluoride, the nitrogen was
metered by a wet test meter.

A bypass around the sorption vessel and the sodium fluoride trap
was provided so that the gases did not flow through the sorption vessel

during startup and shutdown of the metering system.

CHAPTER VI
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

The experimental phase of the study consisted mainly of the
determination of the loading of uranium hexafluoride on single layers
of sodium fluoride pellets during a prescribed time interval under a
given set of conditions. Some work was necessary for preparation of
samples of the uranium hexafluoride-sodium fluoride complex for deter-

mination of crystalline density.

Differential -Bed Studies

 

The differential-bed runs were made by using a single layer of
sodium fluoride pellets placed between two four-and-one-fourth-inch
sections of three-millimeter glass beads used as entrance and exit
sections. As shown in Figure 5, the bed was constructed from one-and-
one-half-inch diameter schedule-forty nickel pipe. The glass beads
were conditioned before use by exposure to fluorine at L00°C for one
hour.

To make a run, the sorption vessel was loaded and placed in the
oil bath. At least one hour was allowed for the bed temperature to
reach that of the oil bath. As shown in Appendix G, after 0.45 hour,
the difference between the center-line temperature of the bed and the
bath temperature will be less than two per cent of the original tempera-
ture difference. Prior to starting a run, the uranium hexafluoride and

nitrogen flow rates were set, and the stream was allowed to flow through

the preheater coil for at least five minutes in order to establish a
constant concentration in the coil. During this period, the stream was
bypassed around the sorption vessel and the sodium fluoride bed. A run
was started by diverting the stream through the differential-bed. Gas
was passed through the bed for a predetermined length of time, after
which the stream was diverted into the bypass. About ten seconds were
required for effecting the valving changes necessary for diverting the
gas stream. The uranium hexafluoride flow was stopped and the nitrogen
flow was continued through the preheater coil for two minutes to free
the coil of uranium hexafluoride. The nitrogen flow was then diverted
through the sorption vessel for one minute to free the bed of unreacted
uranium hexafluoride. The bed was then sealed, removed from the oil
bath, and allowed to cool in a dry box containing dry air. The sodium
fluoride was removed from the reaction vessel in the dry box and placed
in a sealed container for weighing on an analytical balance having a
capacity of 200 grams. The sodium fluoride trap was treated similarly

and weighed on an analytical balance having a two-kilogram capacity.

Determination of Density of Complex

For determination of the crystalline density of the uranium
hexafluoride-sodium fluoride complex, pellets of sodium fluoride that
had been treated with fluorine for ome hour at 400°C were ground with a
mortar and pestle in a dry box. A half-inch layer of the powder in a
nickel dish was exposed to a stream of dilute gaseous uranium hexafluo-

ride (five to ten mole per cent uranium hexafluoride in nitrogen) at
48
100°C, after which the resultant material was again ground with a mortar
and pestle in a dry box. The material was repeatedly exposed to uranium
hexafluoride and ground until the desired weight gain had occurred.
Samples of the material and of the original sodium fluoride were then

submitted for crystalline density determination by toluene immersion.

CHAPTER VII
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Fifty usable differential-bed runs were made in order to provide
data on the rate of sorption of uranium hexafluoride by one-eighth-inch
pellets of sodium fluoride. The concentration profiles of sorbed
uranium hexafluoride on pellets from a number of runs were examined
both photographically and by a reflected X-ray technique. Two samples
of the uranium hexafluoride-sodium fluoride complex were prepared for
determination of the crystalline density, which is required for use of

the mathematical model.

Differential -Bed Studies
Differential-bed runs were made with a single layer of sodium
fluoride pellets in the following range of operating conditions:
Uranium hexafluoride concentration 0.57 to 10.9 mole per cent
Temperature 29 to 100°C
All runs were made with a nitrogen flow rate of 0.129 gram mole per
minute at atmospheric pressure. Approximately 4.5 grams (about 130
pellets) of one-eighth-inch right circular cylindrical sodium fluoride
pellets were used in each run. The results, plus operating conditions,
are presented in Tables I through VI. Data from some runs was not
usable due to experimental difficulties such as poor control of the

flow of the nitrogen or uranium hexafluoride, or other malfunctions of

the apparatus.

Examination of Partially Reacted Pellets

Partially reacted pellets from a number of runs were sectioned
for determination of the distribution of sorbed uranium hexafluoride.
The contrast between the pale yellow color of the complex and the white
color of sodium fluoride allowed qualitative determination of the dis-
tribution of the uranium hexafluoride in a pellet by microscopic and
photographic means. Partially reacted pellets, which have been sec-
tioned axially, are shown in Figures 6 and 7. By use of the proper
filter, the pale yellow of the complex was made to appear grey. The
pellets in Figure 6 are from a run at 50°C and contain the maximum
quantity of uranium hexafluoride which will be sorbed at that tempera-
ture. A considerable variation in penetration of uranium hexafluoride
is observed not only between individual pellets but also between dif-
ferent areas of the same pellet. Of particular interest is the slight
penetration near the corners of some pellets since this type of profile
is not observed in the case of diffusion of a substance into a finite
cylinder of constant properties. It is felt that the differences in
penetration are due to variation in the density of different areas of
the pellet. The method of manufacture of the pellets, compression of
a powder, would be expected to produce variations in density, with high-
density areas in the unreacted corners of the sectioned pellets.
Sectioned pellets containing the maximum quantity of uranium hexafluo-
ride which will be sorbed at 100°C are shown in Figure 7. The profiles
are similar to those at 50°C, except that the penetration is not so

great. Most of the pellets that have sorbed the maximum amount of
59

uranium hexafluoride at 30°C show no unreacted areas.

The concentration profiles of sorbed uranium hexafluoride on a
number of pellets were measured by use of a reflected X-ray technique.
In this method, the target area is bombarded with monoenergetic X rays
having an energy sufficiently high to excite the element of interest;
excited atoms then emit X rays having an energy characteristic of the
excited element. The count rate of emitted X rays is assumed propor-
tional to concentration of the element of interest. Use of this method
allowed the measurement of the uranium concentration in a circular area
100 microns in diameter. The method is somewhat time-consuming, and,
in view of the irregularities in the profile within a pellet as well as
between pellets, only enough profiles were measured to establish the
type of profile, that is, whether the profile is sharp or extends over
a region as predicted by the mathematical model. A typical experimental
profile resulting from sorption at 100°C is shown in Figure 8 and is
observed to be diffuse, in agreement with the mathematical model.
Profiles in some pellets from the same run extended farther into the
pellet, with about five per cent of the pellets being reacted to the
center. The profile extended farther into the pellet at lower tempera-
tures, and a larger percentage of the pellets were reacted to the

center.

fluoride to gaseous uranium hexafluoride. Conditions for preparing
the samples are given in Table VII. Measurements of the sample density
were made by a toluene pycnometric method at 26°C.

Duplicate measurements on sample one, which contained 2.58 grams
of uranium hexafluoride per gram of sodium fluoride, yielded sample
densities of 3.935 grams per cubic centimeter and 3.885 grams per cubic
centimeter. Sample two, which contained 3.54 grams of uranium hexafluo-
ride per gram of sodium fluoride, had a density of 4.128 grams per cubic
centimeter.

For calculation of the crystalline density of the uranium hexa-
fluoride-sodium fluoride complex, the formula UF 2NaF was assumed. It
was also assumed that in a mixture of complex and sodium fluoride each
material exhibited the density of the pure material. On this basis,
63.5 per cent of the sodium fluoride in sample one was complexed, and
the resultant complex densities are 4.13 grams per cubic centimeter and
4.07 grams per cubic centimeter, based on the two reported sample
densities. In sample two, 84.5 per cent of the sodium fluoride was
complexed, and the resultant complex density was 4.20 grams per cubic
centimeter. The average of these figures, 1.13 grams per cubic centi-
meter, was used for determination of a the maximum quantity of
uranium hexafluoride which can react per unit volume at a point in the
pellet. ~The density of a sample of the initial sodium fluoride was
determined to be 2.78 grams per cubic centimeter, which compares quite
59

favorably with the reported value of 2.79 grams per cubic centimeter.

The samples were analyzed before and after exposure to toluene to detect

content of sample two, and a change of less than four per cent was noted
for sample one. The uranium content of the toluene after exposure to
the complex was below the limit of detection (less than 0.003 micrograms
per milliliter). It was concluded that interaction, if present, could

be safely neglected.

CHAPTER VIII

ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

The final evaluation of the mathematical model rests on a com-
parison of experimental and model-predicted data. This comparison and
a discussion of the application of the results of the study to fixed-bed
A

sorber design are given in the following sections. A discussion of

experimental error is also presented.

Differential -Bed Data

 

Several relations [Equations (40), (41), (44), and (45)] were
derived for use in the solution of the differential equation describing
sorption by a single pellet with variable reaction rate constant and
variable diffusivity. In addition to these equations, one has the three
relations for the variation of volume void fraction, effective diffu-
sivity, and reaction rate constant, all of which contain constants whose
values must be determined from experimental data or from a parameter
search. The constants to be determined in the relation for volume void
fraction,

cme, (1-dafay), (17)
are ¢_, the initial void fraction (0.45 for the pellets in this study),
and Uns? the maximum quantity of uranium hexafluoride which can accu-
mulate per unit volume of pellet. This quantity was calculated from
the initial volume void fraction and the crystalline densities of sodium

fluoride and the complex UF, -2NaF and was found to be 0.00595 gram mole
66
of uranium hexafluoride per cubic centimeter of pellet or 1.37 grams of
uranium hexafluoride per gram of sodium fluoride.

The relation for the effective diffusivity in the pellet,

n .
D, = Pur -N 7 € s (18)

contains two constants, y and n, which must be determined in the param-

eter search. Values of Pur,’

in nitrogen, were calculated as shown in Appendix C.

the diffusivity of uranium hexafluoride

The relation for the reaction rate constant 8,

B =a o"E/RT o-ba

J
contains three constants (a, E, and b) which must be determined in the
parameter search.

Without additional information, the parameter search would
involve five constants whose values must be determined. One can,
however, derive relationships between the constants which will markedly
decrease the amount of computer work necessary for determination of the
values of the constants. The first relation is based on Danckwerts'
analytical solution! for the steady-state rate of sorption with irre-
versible reaction for constant reaction rate constant and constant
diffusivity, which is:

dq _ k aCghr [- 1 + kR coth kR] D,
dt = ka + UR [- 1 + kR coth kR] D,

 

Knowing the initial rate of sorption, this expression sets a relation-

ship between the initial values of B and D,.
67
The second relation between constants is that afforded by appli-
cation of the point rate equation to the surface of the pellet. The

point rate of reaction at the surface is

dg = a o “E/RT ed C,

dt N’

which integrates to

t

From experimental data, one knows the time at which sorption ceases, and
hence the value of q which will be 9ax” One does not know the time

variation of C, however, a close approximation is the assumption that

Then, if t is the time at which q has the value q _, one has the
max max
relation

which sets a relation between the value of b and the initial value of 8.

Uax =
With the two relations that have been developed, at a given
temperature one has only two parameters, vy and n, whose values are )
independent. Hence, at a fixed temperature, the parameter search
involves only two parameters. Based on information from the literature
on the observed dependence of D, on g, it was decided to try only two
values for n; these were 1.5 and 2.0. It was apparent very early that

n should have the value of 2.0. Hence the major part of the parameter
68
search involved only two independent parameters, y and E.

In order to accomplish the parameter search, the relations
discussed above were coded in FORTRAN for a finite-difference solution
using the IBM-T7090 computer at the Central Data Processing Facility of
the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The
FORTRAN statements for the computer code are given in Appendix H. For
most of the computer calculations, the spherical pellet upon which the
model is based was divided into forty shells of equal volume; the length
of each time increment was chosen such that the maximum change in the
point reaction rate constant or the point diffusivity during the time
increment would be five per cent of its current value or less. In this
method of solution, the time increments were short initially (about 0.5
second) and increased continuously as the solution progressed so that
after about one hour of computed time had been accumulated, time incre-
ments of approximately 100 seconds were observed. For calculations
covering the first five hours of sorption, approximately 0.006 hour of
computer time was required.

As shown in Appendix F, the calculational method was observed to
converge to within one per cent of the analytical solution for B and D,
of a functional form similar to the experimental case when forty equal-
volume shells were used. As a further check on convergence, a number
of the calculations were repeated using eighty shells and a maximum
change in the current value of B or D, of 2.5 per cent; a difference of
less than one per cent in calculated values for uranium hexafluoride

loading was observed for the two cases.
69

The relations that resulted from the parameter search are:

D = 0.369 D _ €
and
_T000
B= 6.25 x 10%e RI e "13904

A comparison of the experimental data on variation of pellet loading
with time with model-predicted values for the loading using these rate
relations is shown in Figures 9 through 13. Experimental and calcu-
lated values for pellet capacity as a function of temperature are shown
in Figure lk. The root-mean-square error for all points in the study
was 9.5 per cent; the largest error for a single point was 31 per cent.

The values of the parameters should be examined to determine
whether. they are consistent with the proposed model. The labyrinth
factor for the pellets, ye, has an initial value of 0.166, which is
typical for porous materials. It should be noted that this factor is
independent of temperature and the gases taking part in the diffusion
process.

The value of E, TOOO calories per mole, may be slightly low for
the activation energy for diffusion in crystalline materials, however
few data are available on systems comparable to the present one. Using
Equation (21), one can assume a typical value for the diffusivity of
uranium hexafluoride in the crystalline layer of complex and calculate
its thickness. A diffusivity of 0.6 x 1077 square centimeters per

second corresponds to a thickness of 16 angstroms, or about three

molecular layers; both values are felt to be realistic for the system
at hand.

The values of E and a are likewise felt to be of the proper
order of magnitude for the second interpretation of Equation (22) in
which the rate of the chemical reaction was considered to.contribute
a resistance to the rate of sorption.

The effect of a number of pellet properties on sorption rate
and capacity have been considered. Thus far, however, the effect of
surface area has not been discussed. A dependence of sorption charac-
teristics on surface area is predicted through the dependence of the
constants a and b on the surface area, as shown in Equation (21). A
direct dependence of a on S is predicted, and an inverse dependence of
b on S. The net result will be a decrease in effective capacity as the
surface area is increased. Calculations were made using the computer
code for pellets having the same properties as those of the study, with
the exception of surface area. Results are shown in Figure 15 for the
pellets of this study, which had a surface area of 0.86 square meter
per gram, and for pellets having surface areas of 1.0 and 1.2 square
meters per gram. The effective capacity of pellets with a surface area
of 1.1 square meters per gram is about sixty-five per cent that of
pellets having a surface area of 0.86 square meters per gram. This
result is in agreement with data resulting from repeated use of sodium
fluoride pellets. After the first sorption cycle pellets from this
study had a surface area of approximately 1.1 square meters per gram
and an effective capacity of about sixty-five per cent of the initial

capacity.

Application of Data to Sorber Design

The results from the differential-bed studies enable one to
predict the rate of removal of uranium hexafluoride from a gas stream by
a pellet of sodium fluoride at conditions which may be time dependent;
theoretically, one can also use the results to predict the performance
of sorber systems such as fixed or moving beds. The calculations neces-
sary for treatment of the general case are somewhat involved and require
a finite-difference integration in both time and distance throughout the
system. For this reason, the general results will not be included in
this report.

One can consider the results for a specific case which is fre--
quently encountered and which will serve to exemplify the effects of two
system parameters; the temperature, and the diameter of the pellet. The
case to be considered is that of a sorber system operating under condi-
tions such that the pellet loading reaches the effective capacity
throughout most of the sorber system. Such conditions include sorber
systems having a low gas velocity (0.5 centimeter per second in a bed
ten centimeters deep) or systems in which the bed occupies an extended
length (150 centimeters at a gas velocity of 5.0 centimeters per second).
These results, shown in Figure 16, also indicate the minimum quantity
of sodium fluoride of the type used in this study that can be expected
to sorb a given quantity of uranium hexafluoride. The results will be
useful until more detailed information is available from the general

solution.

Discussion of Error

A number of possible sources of error exist in the experimental
techniques used in this study. The major contribution to error probably
arose from the variation of. pellet characteristics between individual
pellets. A second source of error is in the flow rates of the two gases,
nitrogen and uranium hexafluoride, and hence the concentration of the
gas stream entering the sorption vessel. It is felt that the concentra-
tion was known to within five per cent of the concentration value. A
third source of error is in the temperature control of the pellets dur-
ing sorption; the pellet temperature is felt to be known to within 1.0°C
during the initial stages of sorption, and to a much closer degree dur-

ing the subsequent period.

CHAPTER IX

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Conclusions

The following conclusions can be drawn from the results of this
study:

1. Experimental data on the rate and maximum extent of sorption
of uranium hexafluoride by pelleted sodium fluoride has been correlated
with a root-mean-square error of 9.5 per cent.

2. The apparent mechanisms controlling the rate of sorption of
uranium hexafluoride by sodium fluoride pellets are transfer of uranium
hexafluoride across a stagnant gas film surrounding the pellet, diffu-
sion of gaseous uranium hexafluoride in the pore space of the pellet,
and diffusion of uranium hexafluoride through a layer of uranium hexa-
fluoride-sodium fluoride complex covering unreacted sodium fluoride.

3. Sorption of uranium hexafluoride at a point in a sodium
fluoride pellet results in a decrease in the volume void fraction, the
effective diffusivity of gaseous uranium hexafluoride, and the reaction
rate at the point.

4. The maximum quantity of uranium hexafluoride that can be
sorbed at a point in a pellet of sodium fluoride depends only on the
initial void fraction of the pellet at the point. For void fraction

values less than 0.807, incomplete reaction of the sodium fluoride will

occur.
-y

82

5. Cessation of sorption of uranium hexafluoride by pelleted
sodium fluoride occurs when the pores at the external pellet surface
have been filled with complex.

6. The effective capacity of pelleted sodium fluoride for uranium
hexafluoride is inversely dependent on the temperature.

7. The density of the uranium hexafluoride-sodium fluoride com-
plex UFg'2NaF is 4.13 grams per cubic centimeter at 26°C.

8. Considerable variation in characteristics exist in individual
pellets as well as between pellets of commercial sodium fluoride.

9. A useful, general calculational method has been derived for
systems involving variable reaction rate constants and/or variable
diffusivity which is applicable when the steady-state approximation is

valid.

Recommendations

The ultimate objective of the study of sorption of uranium hexa-
fluoride by sodium fluoride pellets is the prediction of the performance
of sorption systems such as fixed-bed or moving-bed sorbers. The com-
puter code resulting from this study can be used to generate data for
pellets of specified characteristics which can be used in calculations
on specific sorber systems.

Until such calculations are made, the data on variation of ef-

fective pellet capacity with system parameters can be used for design

of sorber systems.

The experimental data on sorption rate should be extended to

approximately 200°C; the diluent gas for this work should be fluorine
83
in order to avoid decomposition reactions which the complex can undergo

at higher temperatures.

TEMPERATURE OF PELLET DURING SORPTION

The temperature difference between the interior and the external
surface of a sodium fluoride pellet during sorption is of interest.
Also of interest is the temperature difference between the external

surface of the pellet and that of the gas stream.

Temperature Difference in Pellet
Heat of sorption will cause a temperature difference between the
interior and the surface of a porous pellet during the sorption of

7

uranium hexafluoride. Prater in 1957, from an analytic solution of
the steady-state equations for heat and mass transfer in a porous solid,
derived an equation relating the temperature difference to the reactant
concentration difference and showed it to be independent of the kinetics
of the reaction and of the particle geometry. The relation obtained
was: |
- un,
T-T, =—%g— (cg -¢C), (46)

where

T = temperature at any point within the particle which has. a

concentration C, °C,

T = temperature at the surface of the particle, °C,

C = concentration at any point within the particle, moles cm,

AH = heat of reaction, cal/mole,

D = effective diffusivity of the particle, nsec,
92
K = thermal conductivity of the particle, cal/sec cm*°C.
For the system at hand, the concentration in the interior of the
pellet is zero, so that the maximum temperature difference is then

- MHD,
T-T =——=—C_. (47)

Ss K Ss
The thermal conductivity of sodium fluoride is reported to be 0.036
cal/sec*cm*°C at 100°¢. 12 The thermal conductivity of the pellet was
taken as half this value. The initial value of D, for the pellet is
0.0089 cn’ /sec. The maximum value of Cg in the study is 0.45 x 107°
g mole/cm The value of (- AH) is 23,200 cal/mole. Substitution of

these values into equation (47) yields the temperature difference as:

T-T
s

 

_ (23,200)(0.0089)(0.45 x 1077)
o 0.018 C2?

T - Tg = 0.052°C.

Hence, radial variation in pellet temperature will be negligible.

Temperature Difference Between Pellet and Gas Stream

A conservative estimate of the temperature difference between
the pellet surface and the gas stream will be obtained if one neglects
the effect of heat capacity of the pellet. A heat balance on the pellet

then yields the relation:

A plot of temperature difference between the pellet surface and
the gas stream for the series at 100°C is shown in Figure 17. As would
be expected, the maximum temperature difference was observed for the
series with 8.5 mole per cent uranium hexafluoride. The initial differ-
ence of 9.0°C decreased to less than 1.0°C after 8.0 minutes. As
discussed in Chapter VIII, the difference between pellet temperature and

gas temperature was taken into account during the finite-difference

calculations.

VISCOSITY OF URANIUM HEXAFLUORIDE-NITROGEN MIXTURES

gives the viscosity in centipoise as:

where T is the temperature in degrees Kelvin.

Values for the viscosity of the mixture were calculated using

MEAN FREE PATH OF URANIUM HEXAFLUORIDE IN MIXTURES OF
URANIUM HEXAFLUORIDE AND NITROGEN
In order to decide which type of diffusion occurs in the pores of
a pellet, it is necessary to calculate the mean free path of uranium
hexafluoride in a uranium hexafluoride-nitrogen mixture.

The mean free path of a component in a two-component gas mixture

can be derived by means of the kinetic theory of gases and is given by:
A= : ; (52)

where
A = mean free path of type one molecules,
Ny» N, = gas densities of molecules of type one and type two,
dys d, = molecular diameters of molecules of type one and type two,

19

The molecular diameter of uranium hexafluoride is:
3 -8 .
d; = 4,29 x 10 ~ centimeters,
. . , 50
and the molecular diameter of nitrogen is

d5 = 3.15 x 1078 centimeters.

For the present system, the term involving the molecular weights

+

becomes:

 
102

Assuming ideal gas behavior, the densities of type one and type

two molecules are given by:
N, = 6.023 x 10% Py/RT,
23
N, = 6.023 x 10 P(1 - y)/RT,

where y is the mole fraction of type one molecules.

The equation for the mean free path is then reduced to:

which was used to calculate values in Table XI.

APPENDIX E
PROPERTIES OF THE SODIUM FLUORIDE PELLETS

The sodium fluoride pellets used in this study were nominal one-~
eighth-inch right circular cylinders. They were manufactured by the
compaction of sodium bifluoride followed by heating to about 300°C in
order to volatilize the hydrogen fluoride. Prior to use, the pellets
were contacted with elemental fluorine at 400°C for one hour in order to
fluorinate impurities and remove residual hydrogen fluoride.

The fluorinated pellets had the following properties:

Average weight of all pellets 0.0349 grams per pellet

Average weight of whole pellets 0.036 grams per pellet

Average length of whole pellets 0.1251 inch

Average diameter of whole pellets 0.1208 inch
The weight loss of the pellets during fluorination was 1.6 per cent of
the original weight. The chemical composition of the fluorinated
pellets is shown in Table XII.

The pore volume distribution, porosity, and surface area of the

pellets were determined by both nitrogen and mercury porosimetry by the
Special Analytical Service Group at the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion
Plant. The following properties were noted:

Surface area by nitrogen adsorption 0.856 square meter per gram

Median pore radius 0.678 micron

Average pore radius 0.791 micron

Void fraction 0.40

The variation of fractional pore volume with average pore radius is
shown in Figure 18.

The reported void fraction of 0.40, based on the pore volume
contained in pores of 3.7 micron radius or smaller, was lower than the
calculated void fraction of 0.45 based on external dimensions and the
crystalline density of sodium fluoride (2.79 grams per cubic centimeter).
It is probable that the pore volume in pores having radii greater than

‘3.7 microns would account for the discrepancy.

CONVERGENCE CHARACTERISTICS OF NUMERICAL METHOD

It is desirable to check the convergence characteristics of the
numerical method of calculation. Since one does not have the analytical
solution to the general problem which has been solved numerically, a
direct comparison is not possible. One can, however, examine the degree
of convergence for a number of special cases.

The numerical method was derived for solution of the relation

2 | dD

S24 2,1 _e € _B o-oo (54)
dr r

for arbitrary dependence of £ and D, on r and with the boundary condi-

tions
C=C at r =R,
dC
iT = Oat r = 0.

It should be noted that for constant values of B and D,, the numerical
solution using one shell reduces to the analytical solution.

In the problem at hand, the forms of B and D, are such that after
some reaction has occurred, the values of 8 and D, increase as one moves
along the radius of the sphere from the surface to the center. If one
chooses B and D, to be of this general form and ‘specifically to be:

R 2

r

 

 

 

 
which is of the same form as the solution obtained by Thiele in 1939

109

Equation (54) is reduced to

ec pr
~~ px © =0. (55)

This equation may be integrated analytically to yield the solution

C = A cosh ap +B sinn 2x r. (56)

Applying the boundary conditions which were used for the numerical
procedure, namely,
C=C _atr =R,
Ss -

ar = 0aetr=0

The rate of reaction in the sphere is then:

results in the solution:

 

Rate = LrRSDx SC
dr
r=R,
which yields the final result,
Rate = WRC /BF D¥ tanh ,./P*/D¥ R, (58)

25

for a reaction in a single pore.

The numerical method resulted in the relations:

Rate = HRD C on [1+ Roy ~ ORy_18y s (59)

If the sphere under consideration is of radius R and is divided
into N shells of equal volume, the outer radius R of shell m is given
by:

Choosing the same relations for B and D. as used in the analytical
solution, and taking the values of Pn and D. in shell m to be the values

of B and D, at the outer radius of shell m, one obtains the relations:

for several values of N and 6 using equations (58) and (62) are shown

in Figure 19. Values of 6 in the present study are in the range five to
eighty so that an error of less than one per cent will occur when forty
shells are used in the calculation. Although the error encountered in
the solution of the actual case will differ from this value, it is felt

that Figure 19 represents a good estimate of the error which can be

expected.

HEAT TRANSFER CHARACTERISTICS OF DIFFERENTIAL-BED AND GAS PREHFATER

In the differential-bed studies, the bed and a gas preheater were
placed in a constant temperature bath. Two calculations related to
heat transfer are of interest. The first of these is the difference in
temperature between that of the center-line of the bed and that of the
bath before a run is started; the second is the inlet gas temperature
to the differential-bed during a run.

A conservative estimate of the time required for the difference
in temperature between the center-line of the bed and the bath to be
some fraction of the initial temperature difference will be obtained if
one treats the bed as an infinite cylinder. Carslaw and Jaegeri! give
the radial temperature distribution in an infinite cylinder that is
initially at constant temperature and has a constant surface tempera-
ture. In order to use the solution one must know the thermal diffu-
sivity of the differential-bed, which is essentially a bed of three
millimeter diameter glass beads. Assuming a diffusivity of 0.002 square
centimeter per second, after 0.45 hour the temperature difference
between the center-line of the bed and the bath will be less than two
per cent of the initial temperature difference. Thus, one hour is
sufficient time to allow the differential-bed to achieve the temperature
of the bath.

The preheater consisted of fifty feet of three-eighths-inch

tubing. If average values for the heat capacity and the transfer
115

coefficient are used, a heat balance yields the relation:
\

d
FC, = rd (T, - T), (63)

where

rj

gas flow rate,

C_ = heat capacity of gas,

P
T = temperature of gas,
TI, = temperature of coil,

h = heat transfer coefficient,
d = inside diameter of coil.

Integration of equation (63) yields:

T -T _ hmd
T -T, 2
w 1 ’ :

where T, is the initial gas temperature.

i
If one assumes a heat transfer coefficient of 0.5 Btu/hr+£to:°F, the
temperature ratio has a value of 1076 for a typical differential-bed

run.
