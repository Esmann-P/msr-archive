CONSIDERATIONS OF LOW PRESSURE DISTILLATION AND ITS APPLICATION.
_.TO_PROCESSING OF MOLTEN-SALT BREEDER REACTOR FUELS

“L. E. McNeese
ABSTRACT

Distillation at low pressure was examined as ‘a method
for removing rare earth fluorides from the fuel stream of
-a molten-salt breeder ‘reactor. It was concluded that dis-
tillation allows: adequate rare earth fluoride removal with
‘the simultaneous recovery of more than 99, 5% of the fuel
salt. Characteristics of equilibrium and molecular =
distillation were noted and expressions for the relative !
volatility of rare earth fluorides were derived for these
types of distillation, > :

Expressions for the separation potential of several
modes of distillation were derived and reported rare:
earth fluoride relative volatilities were shown to allow

_a great deal of latitude in still design and operational
mode. ‘It was concluded that a single contact ‘stage such
as ‘a well mixed liquid pool provides adequate rare earth .
fluoride removal and that ‘rectification is not required,

. The buildup of rare earth fluorides - ‘at the vapori-
zation surface was ‘shown to seriously reduce the :
effectiveness of a distillation system, .Liquid circu-
lation was shown to be an effective means for preventing
buildup of rare earth fluorides at vaporization surfaces,

br Ti

‘The molten-salt breeder reactor (MSER) is a reactor concept
having ‘the - possibilities of economic nuclear power production and
"#twaltaneoss breeding of fissile material using ‘the thorium-uranium
fuel cycled ‘The reactor will be fueled with a mixture of molten
fluoride salts which will circulate continuously ‘through the reactor

core where fission occurs ‘and through the primary heat exchanger

 vhere most of the fission energy ‘is removed. The reactor will employ

a blanket of molten fluorides containing a fertile material (thorium)

 
 

in order to increase the neutron economy of the system by: the con-
version of thorium to fissile uranium-233.. A close~-coupled processing
facility for removal of fission products, corrosion products, and
fissile materials from these fused fluoride mixtures will be an

integral part of the reactor system.

It has been proposed that the rare earth fluorides (REF) - and
fluorides of Ba, Sr, and Y be removed from the fuél stream by
vacuum distillation. The purpose of this report is to examine.
various factors pertinent to such an operation and to compare several

methods for effecting ‘the distillation. .
2. DISTILLATION AT LOW PRESSURE

The vaporization of a liquid is normally carried out under
conditions such that the liquid and vapor phases are essentially
in thermodynamic equilibrium, This condition may cease to exist
if the distillation pressure is reduced sufficiently, and phenomena

peculiar to low pressure distillation may be observed.

In discussing distillation at low pressure, it is convenient
to make ‘a distinction between two modes of distillation: equilibrium
distillation and molecular distillation. During equilibrium
distillation, a kinetic equilibrium exists at the liquid-vapor
interface owing to the presence of a vapor atmosphere above the
liquid which has the net effect of immediately returning most of the
vaporizing molecules to the. liquid surface. In contrast, molecular
distillation is carried out in the absence of such an atmosphere
and the vaporizing molecules reach. the condensing surface without
experiencing collisions with other gas ‘molecules or with the walls
of the system. In the following sections, consideration will be
given to characteristics of these modes of distillation, to values
of the ‘mean. free path under conditions of interest for MSBR
processing, and to calculated values of maximum vaporization rates

to be expected,

 

 
 

 

 

cl

 

‘2,1. Equilibrium Distillation

Equilibrium distillation can be further divided into ebullient
distillation and evaporative distillation. Ebullient distillation
occurs when bubbles of vapor form within the bulk of the liquid
which remains at a temperature such that the vapor pressure is
equal to the total external pressure acting on the liquid (in the
absence of other gases). ‘Boiling promotes mixing in the liquid

‘and the surface from which vaporization occurs is not depleted in

the more volatile species,

"Evaporative distillation occurs when the distillation is carried
out at a temperature below. the boiling point of the liquid. Under
these conditions there is no formation of bubbles at points below
the 1iquid surface and no visible movement of the liquid surface,
Transfer of the more volatile species to the. liquid surface occurs

by a combination of molecular diffusion and convective mixing so

that depletion of this species: inthe vicinity of the surface is

possible, However, the rate of distillation is relatively low owing
to the kinetic equilibrium which exists at the liquid-vapor interface
and the liquid surface may have ‘a composition near that of the bulk

‘liquid.

2,2 Molecular Distillation

'

Molecular distillation is quite similar to evaporative distillation

in that vaporization occurs only from a quiescent liquid surface

and in that the vaporizing species is transferred to the surface by

~ molecular diffusion and convective mixing. However, few of the

vaporizing molecules ‘are returned to the liquid surface by

collisions in the vapor space above the liquid and vaporizdtion

proceeds at the greatest rate possible at the operating temperature.

In order to achieve this condition, the distance between the

vaporizing surface and the condensing surface should theoretically

be less than the "mean free path" of the distilling molecules. This

condition 1s seldom realized in practice, however the distance should

 
 

be no greater than a few mean free paths, These conditions favor a
greater buildup of rare earth fluorides at the liquid surface ‘than
do those of evaporative distillation at the ‘same temperature where
vaporization is impeded by the vapor: atmosphere above’ the liquid
which serves to return most of the vaporized molecules to the Liquid

surface.

2.3 ‘Mean Free Path

“In & distillation system, the gases in the region between the
vaporizing liquid and the condenser normally consist of a mixture
of ‘the distilling molecules and molecules of noncondensable gases.
. The calculation of the mean free path in this region is complicated
by the fact that the vaporizing molecules, which have a net velocity
component directed away from the liquid surface, ‘pass -into gas
whose molecules are in random motion. . The -mean free path of a type
1 molecule in type 2 molecules may be obtained from a relation
given by Loeb as |

 

NN 2 = mean free path of a type 1 molecule moving among type 2
=) molecules

0,02 = collision diameters of type 1 and type 2 molecules

n = number of type 2 molecules per unit volume -

C1,C> = average velocity of ‘type 1 and type 2 molecules.
By making appropriate substitutions into this relation, one can obtain
the following relation for the mean free path-of a type 1 molecule
in type ‘2 molecules at a pressure P, both gases being at the
temperature T.

where
R = gas constant, (mm Hg) (cm®)/(°K)(gmole)
0,02 = collision diameters of type 1 and 2 molecules

M; ,Mz = molecular weights of type-l and 2 molecules.

Values for the mean free path of LiF ‘in Ar and in LiF at 1000°C

are given in Fig. 1. It should be noted that the mean free path of
LiF at a pressure of ‘1 mm Hg is approximately 0.04 cm and that at a
pressure of 0.01 mm Hg, the mean free path of LiF is approximately

4 cm. These distances are probably quite small in comparison with
the distance between the condenser and the surface from which
vaporization will occur in an MSBR distillation system. Hence, the
rate of distillation in an MSBR system will be set by the pressure

drop between the liquid surface and the condensing surface. The

values for the mean free path are sufficiently large that slip-~flow

may be of importance in pressure drop considerations.

2.4 Langmuir Vaporization Rate

A derivation of this relation will be given in order to ‘show the

region of its applicability. Consider a plane liquid surface at
a temperature below ite boiling point. At equilibrium, ‘the rate

of vaporization from the surface ‘will equal the rate of condensation

~ on the surface, ‘Langmiur postulated that the rate of vaporization

in a high vacuum is the same as ‘the rate of ‘vaporization in the

presence of a saturated vapor and that the rate of condensation in

The assumptions implicit : in the use of this relation for cal- :
‘culating the rate of vaporization from a liquid surface include ;
the following:
(1) The liquid surface is plane.
(2) The liquid surface is of infinite extent, i.e. collisions
of molecules with the vessel walls in the vapor space must
exert a negligible influence on the rate of vaporization, .
(3) The vapor behaves ‘as an ideal gas. i . i
(4) Every part of the liquid surface is within a fraction of N
the mean free path from every other part or from a oo
condensing surface, i.e., the effect of collisions between
evaporating molecules on the rate of vaporization is
negligible. | )
(5) The number of molecules leaving the liquid surface is not
affected by the number striking the surface.
(6) Vapor molecules striking the liquid surface are absorbed
and revaporized in a direction given by a cosine relation
which is independent of the direction of approach at the

moment of absorption.

When applied to the vaporization of LiF-BeFp mixtures, the

poorest of these assumptions is likely that of considering the vapor

to behave as an ideal gas since it is known that gaseous LiF tends

to associate. The vaporization rate given by Eq. 11 represents the
maximum rate at which vaporization will occur and hence sets ‘an
upper limit on the vaporization rate. Values for the Langmuir
vaporization rate of LiF are given in Fig. 2. The vaporization rates
observed in practice may be considerably lower than the Langmuir rate

since the fourth assumption is rarely met.

2.5 Probable Operating Mode for MSBR Processing

The mode of distillation currently envisioned for processing
MSBR fuel salt is that of single stage equilibrium distillation at
950° ~1050°C and at a pressure of -approximately 1 mm Hg. The
composition of liquid in equilibrium with vapor having the composition
of MSBR fuel salt (6l mole % LiF - 36 mole ¢ BeFp) is approximately
88 mole ¢ LiF =- 12 mole % BeFo. The vapor pressure of liquid of
this composition is ~ 1.5 mm Hg at -1000°C.” ‘Hence, evaporative
distillation, with surface vaporization only, will occur if the
distillation is carried out at a pressure greater than 1.5 mm Hg.
However, if the distillation is carried out at a pressure lower than
1.5 mm Hg, boiling could occur below the liquid surface. At a pressure
of 0.5 mm Hg, boiling could occur to a depth of about 0.7 cm. The
actual depth to which boiling would occur is dependent on the
vertical variation of liquid temperature and composition (and hence
vapor pressure) and on the extent of superheating of the liquid;
the value of 0.7 cm assumes a constant temperature and concentration
and no superheat throughout the bulk of the liquid. Boiling in the
vicinity of the liquid surface would promote convective mixing
which would result in a lower rare earth fluoride concentration
at the liquid surface than would be observed without such mixing.
The lower surface concentrations would in turn decrease the relative

rate of volatilization of REF with respect to LiF.

.Molecular distillation offers two advantages over either type
of equilibrium distillation in .that (1) the distillation proceeds |
at the maximum rate, and (2) a greater separation of rare earth
fluorides from the MSBR fuel salt is possible as will be discussed
~ in the section on relative volatilities. Its chief disadvantages
‘are the low pressure required to achieve this type of distillation
and the increased likelihood of an undesirable buildup of rare earth

fluoride at the liquid surface.

The MSBR distillation system will probably be operated at the

vapor pressure of the liquid at the vaporization surface or possibly

 
 

 

 

 

 

£)

 

S11

at a pressure:0.5-1.0 mm Hg lower than the vapor pressure, A decrease

in pressure could yield an increase ‘in distillation rate-and/or a
decrease in operating temperature. Entrainment at the lower pressures
should be considered. It is improbable that the advantages to be
gained by molecular distillation justify the effort necessary to attain

this mode of operation.

3. RELATIVE VOLATILITY
The relative volatility is a convenient -form for presenting
data relating the composition of liquid and vapor phases at equilibrium
and is defined as

a = Ya/Yg
AB x, [xg

 

| (2)

where

Yu Yp = mole fraction of component A, B in vapor
*0%p

If the concentration of component A is low compared to that of

a. = relative volatility of component ‘A referred to component B

mole fraction of component A, B in liquid.

‘the major component (B), the relative volatility can be expressed

in a useful approximate form

o

“a7 T, 2
where
Cc, = moles A/unit volume of condensed vapor
C, = moles A/unit volume of liquid.’

-and where the condensed vapor and liquid are at the temperature at which
‘vaporization is carried out. .In a binary system, the:error introduced

in relative volatility by this approximation depends on the concentration

of component ‘A, the relative volatility, and the relative molar volumes

of components A and B, The error can be evaluated as follows.

Let @ denote the actual relative volatility as defined by
Eq..12, and @" denote the relative volatility in the approximate
form defined by Eq. 13. From Eq. 13,

and B are equal. It should be noted that the error in &" introduced
by Eq. 13 is less than 18% for X, < 0.15 mole fraction if a < 2.46.
For rare earth fluorides in LiF, A io error in o* will be approximately
three times the values shown for @ < 10 3 since the molar volume

of rare earth fluorides is approximately three times that of LiF."

The definition of relative volatility given by Eq. .12 has
been used throughout this report except in Section 5 where the

definition given by Eq. .13 was used.

The appropriate forms of the relative volatility will be
derived in the following sections for both equilibrium and molecular
distillation, and a comparison of experimental and calculated values
of relative volatility for several rare earth fluorides in LiF will

be made.

3.1 Relative Volatility for Equilibrium Distillation -

3.2 Relative Volatility for Molecular Distillation

With molecular distillation, the liquid and vapor phases are
not in thermodynamic equilibrium; instead, the composition of the
vaporizing material is related to that of the liquid by a dynamic
equilibrium which is dependent on the relative rates for vaporization
of the various components of the liquid. An expression for the

rate of vaporization of a pure liquid was derived in Section 2.h,

Thus, the molar rate of vaporization for any substance, at a given

ly, SEPARATION POTENTIAL OF VARIOUS DISTILLATION METHODS

Several modes of operation -are -available for the distillation

of MSBR fuel salt; the choice between these will involve consideration

of their separation potential as well as factors such as degree of
complexity, economics, etc, In the following sections, a comparison
will be made of the separation potential of distillation systems
employing continuous, batch, and semicontinuous methods. A semi-

continuous system employing rectification will also be considered.

4.1 Continuous Distillation

Consider a continuous distillation system of the type shown in
Fig. 4. Salt containing Ce moles REF/mole LiF is fed to the
system at a rate of F moles LiF/unit time. A vapor stream
containing OC moles REF/mole LiF is withdrawn at the rate of v moles
LiF/unit time and salt containing C moles REF/mole LiF is discarded
at the rate of Fev moles LiF/unit time, A material balance on REF
yields the relation

FC, = (vr + F-v)C.

(4) The vaporization rates for LiF and BeF; are unaffected by
the presence of REF and hence are the steady state

the low concentration of REF in the vapor from the

4,6 Comparison of Methods Considered

A comparison of the various distillation methods must take
account of numerous factors such as separation potential,
operability, economics, etc. Consideration of all of these factors
is beyond the scope of this report, however, the two topics of

separation potential and operational simplicity will be discussed.

For currently envisioned processing rates, the required removal
efficiency for the rare earth fluorides is approximately 90% for
the more important neutron poisons (Pm, Nd, Sm) and less for other
members of this group. It should be recalled that the real
requirement is the rate at which neutron poisons are removed from.

the reactor system, hence the "required removal efficiency" can be

‘lowered at the expense of an increased throughput in the processing

plant. With this in mind, !a rare earth fluoride removal efficiency
of 90% will be used as a basis for discussion of separation potential
for the various distillation methods.

As shown in Table 1, recent measurements indicate the relative
volatilities (referred to LiF) of some of the more important rare
earth fluorides to be 6 x 10 % for NdFs, 5 x 10 4. for SmFs, and
3 x 10 4 for LaF at 1000°C in LiF. The relative volatility of CeFg
was found to be 3 x 10°23, however, the required removal efficiency
for CeFs is only 8%.

The fraction of REF not vaporized for the various distillation

"methods considered is given in Table 2. The values were calculated

for a REF relative volatility of 5 x 1074 and a LiF recovery of
99.5%. As would be expected, the continuous system yields the
poorest REF removal (91%) although this is an adequate removal
efficiency. The removal efficiency for a semicontinuous system is
somewhat higher (95.2%). The combination of semicontinuous dis-
 tillation followed by batch operation to yield a 10% heel results
in a REF removal of 99.5% which is comparable to that obtained with
batch operation (99.744). The effectiveness of rectification is
pointed out by the REF removal (99.9967%) for a semicontinuous

system containing one theoretical plate in sddition to the reboiler.

Semicontinuous with Rectification 0.999967

 

 

The continuous distillation system is considered to be the
simplest operationally, This system will operate with a near
constant heat load (due to fission product decay) and liquid level
which will allow prediction and control of concentration and
temperature gradients in the liquid phase and will simplify instru-
menting the system. Waste salt could be removed from the system at

frequent intervals rather than continuously.

The semicontinuous system is considered to be slightly more

complex operationally than the continuous system; this complexity
 

 

 

 

 

35

arises ‘primarily from the transient nature. of this mode of operation
and the associated variation of the fission product heat load with
time. Reduction of the liquid volume in the system near the end of
a cycle by batch operation will not complicate instrumenting the :
system if the heel volume is not less than approxinately 10% of the
initial still volume.

Operation of a batch system will be significantly more ‘compli-
cated than either of “the above systems for a number of reasons.
The cycle time for this system should be relatively short in order
to maintain an ‘acceptably low salt inventory, hence the system must
be charged and discharged frequently. Control of temperature ‘and
concentration gradients in the liquid will be complicated by the
continual variation of both liquid level and heat generation per
unit volume, Near the end of a cycle, the liquid volume in the
system will be approximately 0. 5% of the initial volume; accurate
measurement of Liquid level at this point may be difficult,

Conceivably, a continuous distillation system employing
rectification would be as simple operationally as a continuous
‘system without rectification. However, a system using rectification
probably requires ‘a greater extension of present technology than any
of the systems considered. Problems ‘such as vapor- liquid contact
are aggravated by the necessity for Tow pressure, high temperature
operation. The very high rare “earth removal efficiency achievable

with rectification is not required for MSBR processing.

Based on the factors considered, the distillation methods can

be listed in order of decreasing desirability as follows:

1. continuous

2. . semicontinuous with batch reduction to yield a 104 heel
3. semicontinuous So

4. batch

5. continuous with rectification

5. ‘PREVENTION .OF BUILDUP OF ‘NORVOLATILES AT A VAPORIZING SURFACE Sh .
BY LIQUID PHASE MIXING

During vaporization of a multicomponent mixture, materials

 

less volatile than the bulk of the mixture tend to remain in the
liquid phase and are removed from the liquid surface by the processes
of convection and molecular diffusion. As noted in Section II, low
pressure distillation will result in little if any convective mixing
in the liquid and an appreciable variation in the concentration of
materials of low volatility is possible if these materials are
removed by diffusion only. The extent of surface buildup and the
effectiveness of liquid phase mixing will be examined for a continuous

still, although the phenomena is common to all types of stills.

Consider a continuous. still of the ype shown in Fig. I1. Fuel
carrier salt. (LiF-BeF,) containing fission product fluorides is
fed to the bottom of the system continuously. Most of the LiF-BeF, }
fed to the system is vaporized and a salt stream containing most Bh
of the nonvolatile materials is withdrawn continuously. The a
positive x direction will be taken as vertically upward and the
liquid withdrawal point and the liquid surface will be located at
x = 0 and x = 4, respectively. Assume that above the liquid
“withdrawal point, molten LiF containing rare earth fluorides (REF)
flows upward at a constant velocity V. At the surface, a fraction
v/V of the LiF vaporizes and the remaining LiF is returned to the
bottom of the still,

Above the withdrawal point, the concentration of REF satisfies

relative volatility of REF is 5 x 10 # are given in Fig. 12. The
following two effects should be noted;

1. The value of ¢ is essentially unity for V4/D < 0.1 for
any value of v/V (fraction of LiF vaporized per circu-
‘lation through still), Within this region, a near
uniform REF concentration is maintained by diffusion
of REF within the liquid and mixing by liquid circu-
lation is not required.

2. The value of ¢ is strongly dependent on v/V for

V£/D > 1. ‘Within this region, a near uniform REF

concentration can be maintained only if liquid circu-

‘lation is provided. For V/D = 100, @ has a value of

0.0055 with no liquid circulation and a value of 0.99

if 90% of the LiF is returned to the bottom of the still,
“An actual still would probably operate in the region VZ/D > 1 so
‘that the importance of liquid circulation can not be over emphasized.
Liquid phase mixing by circulation is believed to be an essential
feature of an effective distillation system. In the case considered,
circulation was provided by an external loop for mathematical con-
“venience. In an actual still internal circulation could be, provided
by a toroidal liquid flow ‘path which, for a liquid having a strong
‘volume heat source (provided 1n the ‘present case by fission product
decay), would result if more cooling were ‘provided. to the still in an

outer annular region than in the center.

6. CONCLUSIONS ‘AND RECOMMENDATIONS

"The following conclusions have been drawn from the. information

considered in ‘this report:

1.

Distillation at low pressure allows the adequate removal

of rare earth fluorides from MSBR .fuel salt and the

- simultaneous recovery of more than 99.5% of the fuel salt.

Recently reported relative volatilities of several rare

earth fluorides allow a great deal of latitude in still

design and operational mode. A single contact stage such
as ‘a liquid pool is adequate ‘and rectification is not

necessary.

The effectiveness of a distillation system can be seriously
decreased by the buildup of rare earth fluorides at-the
surface of the vaporizing liquid.

Liquid circulation can provide adequate liquid phase
mixing and is an essential feature of an effective dis-

tillation system.

The following recommendations are made:

“1.

Further consideration should be given to the use of single-

stage, continuous distillation for removal of rare earth

~ fluorides from the fuel stream of an MSBR.

The ‘study of ‘liquid phase temperature and concentration
profiles should be extended to stills having configurations
of interest for MSBR processing. Methods should be

‘devised for the calculation of velocity, temperature ‘and

concentration in the liquid phase of a three dimensional
still having ‘a distributed heat source, The effect of

variations in heat generation rate ‘should be considered.

 
h2

3. Removal of fission product decay heat from a distillation
system should be studied. Heat removal systems which
maintain the temperature within acceptable limits in the
event of failure of the primary cooling system should be’
devised. |

4, Factors which limit distillation rate such as operating
- pressure, the presence of noncondensables, and entrainment

should be examined.
