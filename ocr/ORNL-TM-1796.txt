THE. REACTIVITY BATANCE IN THE MSRE

J. R. Engel .'B., BE. Prince
ABSTRACT

Reactivity balances have been calculated for the MSRE since

the start of power operation. After an initial period of manual
calculations while the computer was being set up, machine calcu-

lations were started which are now routinely performed every

5 minutes while the reactor is in operation. The calculations.

are carried out by an on-line (Bunker-Ramo Model 340) computer

using current values of reactor parameters such as temperature,

power, and control-rod positions. All the known factors that

have significant reactivity effects are computed and a residual

reactivity required to ‘keep the reactor just critical is evalugted.

Barly results showed that the 35Xe poisoning in the MSEE
(~ 0.3% 8k/k at 7.2 Mw) was lower than was expected and results
during xenon transients were used to construct a model to de-
scribe the xenon behavior. Subsequent results have been used
to monitor the reactor operation for the appearance of anomalous
reactivity effects. After the equivalent of 95 days' operation
at meximum power, the residual reactivity is + 0.05 + 0.04%
8k/k. * This indicates excellent agreement between the predicted
end observed behavior of the reactor. No significant anoma-
lous effects have been observed.

Prior to the start of reactor operation, a limit of + 0.5%
- 8k/k was. imposed on the residual reactivity as a criterion for

critical operation of the ‘reactor. This limit has ‘not been
approached. :

5 Smo

The availability of an on- line digital computer: for the ‘purpose of

data logging and routine computations for the MSRE has made feasible the

continuous monitoring of the important reactivity effects associated with
power operation of the reactor. Steady power operation requires that a

“balance be maintained between the rate of production of neutrons from
~ fission and their rate of disappearance due to absorption and leakage to

the surroundings. The reactivity is a quantity introduced to describe

' physical situations in which these rates do not balance. It is convenient

 
 

to express this quantity as the algebraic fraction of the production rete
which equals the net rete of accumulation (+) or depletion (-) of neutrons

in the entire reactor, i.e.,

Total Production Rate — Total Depletion Rate

Reactivity = Total Production Rate

In one , sense, therefore, the reactivity makes its appearance physically
only when the reactor power level is changing. At steady power, the reac-
tivity must be zero, and any attempt to ascribe separate reactivity com-
ponents (both positive and negative) to the steady state is merely a
convenient bookkeeping device. If we use this device to monitor the ‘re=-
actor operation and find that the algebraic sum of the calculated components
is not zero, this may mean either that the calculations of the individual
known effects are in error, or that there are unknown, or anomalous changes
occurring in the neutron reaction rates which are not accounted for in the
calculations. Power operation of the reactor is a complex situation where
many effects are simultaneously influencing the neutron reaction rates.

The device of separating the effects according to a reactivity scale
allows individual experiments or computations to be used as an aid in.
interpreting the whole process. Thus, continuous monitoring of the com-
ponent reactivities serves both to test our confidence in individual
measurements and, potentially, as a means of detecting and interpreting
anomslous changes in the reaction rates during operation.

As an illustration of these general considerations, we describe in
the following sections the basis and approximations used for the reactivity
balence calculation for the MSRE. We emphasize at the outset that the
methods and quantitative results of analysis of MSRE operation to date are
still subject to possible future modifications. In discussing the results,
wherever possible we will attempt to indicate the level of confidence
in present calculations of the individual reactivity effects.

DESCRIPTION OF THE REACTIVITY BATANCE

The Reference Conditions | .

If we are to mont tor changes in component reactivity effects during
operation, it is advantageous to choose .a starting, or reference condition
which cen be defined by experimental measurement with relatively little
error or ambiguity. The reference conditions chosen for the present work
correspond to the just critical reactor, isothermal at 1200°F, with fuel
circulating and free of fission products, and with all three control rods
withdrawn to their upper limits (51 inches). The uranium concentration for
these conditions, as well as the increase in uranium concentration required
to compensate for a range .of control-rod insertions and isothermel tempera-
ture changes was established during a program of zero-power nuclear experi-

‘ments carried out in the summer of 1965 (Ref. 1). In this program, inde-..

pendent measurements of control-rod reactivity worth (period — differential
worth experiments and rod drop: integral worth experiments) were used to

determine reactivity equivalents of uranium concentration changes and

isothermal temperature changes.
The General Reactivity Balance Equation
The equation deseribing the general situation when the resctor is
operating at some intermediate steady power level includes terms repre-
senting, relative to the reference state,
1. | the total excess ‘uranium added before. increasing ‘the power,
2. the poisoning effect of the rod insertions, and
3. the power and time- integrated pover dependent effects of
changes in fuel and graphite temperature. levels and spatial
distributions, uranium burp, and fission product buildup
(*35%e, 149m, 1S%gn, and non-saturating fission products).
This lst. includes the most important effects of substantial power genera-
tion. ‘There are, however, other ‘known effects of smaller ‘magnitude erising
+ from 1sotople burnup which mist be added to ‘this list. These include: -
1. the burnout of the small amount of Lithium-6 present in the
clean fuel salt,

 
 

2. burnout of residual boron-10 from the unirradiated graphite

moderator,

3. production of plutonium-239 from absorptions in urenium-238,

and
4. ' Changes in the concentrations of uraniun-234 e and 236 in the
fuel salt due to neutron absorption. oo

There are, in addition, other known reactivity effects which can be shown

to be insignificant. in the MSRE, such as photoneutron reactions in the
beryllium in the fuel salt, and several high-energy neutron reactions.

This completes the list of component reactivity effects only if we assume
© that the structural configuration of the graphite stringers and the associ-

‘ated matrix of fuel-salt channels undergo no significant changes during

the power-generating history of the core. If changes in the fuel-moderator

geometry -are induced, for example by nominiform temperature-expansion
effects or cumulative radiation-damage effects on the graphite, this
could appear &s an anomelous reactivity effect, not explicitly accounted
for in the reactivity belence.
There is substantial evidence that another special resctivity effect
is of importance in the operation of the MSRE. This arises. from the en-
trainment of helium-gas bubbles in the circulating fuel salt, through the
“action of the xenon-stripping spray ring in the Puel-pump tank. These

minute, circulating helium bubbles would be expected to affect the reac-
tivity in two ways, by modifying the neutron leakage through an effective

reduction in the density of the fuel salt, and by. providing an additional
- sink for 135%e, thereby reducing the effective xenon migration to the
graphite pores. (This will be discussed in greater detail in a later
section. )

We cen summarize the preceding discussion in the form of & general =

equation for the reactivity balance. By using the symbol K(x) to repre-

sent the algebraic value of the reactivity change due to component x, and
grouping terms which can be treated similarly in the calculations, one
obtains: a

+ K(Xenon-135) + K(Bubbles)
+ K(Isotope Burnout) -
+ K(Residual) Len : oo (1)

The final term on the right hand side of the above equation includes any
small residual effects known to occur which are not explicitly accounted
for in the calculation (such as long-term effects of gadolinium burnup

on the ‘control-rod reactivity), effects of any anomalous changes in the
graphite-fuel salt configuration, permeation of the graphite by salt, or
changes in fuel-salt composition. If, in addition, we consider each term
in Eq. 1 to represent cur best estimate of the individual effect, rather
then the value we could compute with perfect information, the final term
in Eq. 1 will also contain any residual reactivity corrections due to
errors in calculating the other terms. In order to meke this report

~ reasonably self-sufficient, we will give a brief review of the basis of

calculation of each term of f Ba. 1 in the order given.

Control-Rod Worth

‘Of the terms in Eq. 1, the rod worth, the 225U reactivity worth, and
the temperature-level reactivity effects [K(Temp.)], are based on zero-
power experimental measurements. Because the uranium and temperature reac-

tivity effects are inferred from the control-rod calibration experiments,
~ and also because the magnitude of other known power-dependent reactivity

effects are evaluated according to the time variation of the control-rod
position following a-change in power level, accurate knowledge of the rod
worth is vital to the successful interpretation of the reactivity balance.

The control rods were calibrated by means of rod bump-period measurements

made with the reactor at zero power (i.e, with negligible temperature

feedback effects), and with the: fuel circulating pump stopped. These were
made during a period of uranium additions sufficient to vary the initial
critical position of one rod (the regulating rod) over its entire length
of travel. At three. intermediate 235U concentrations, banked insertions
of the two shim rod required to balance specified increments of withdrawal
of the regulating rod were measured.” In this way, various combinations

 
 

 

 

of shim- and regulating-rod insertions equivalent in their reactivity
poisoning effect were obtained. Rod-drop experiments were also performed
at three intermediate 235U concentrations. In these experiments, the
equivalent integral negative reactivity insertion of the rod, falling from
its initial eritical position to its scram position we.s measured.s®
Agreement between the integral of the differential worth. measurements and
the integral reactivity obtained: directly from the rod-drop experiments
was found to be within 5% of the total negative reactivity. insertion in-
volved in each experiment.

The reactivity vs position calibration curve for the regulating » rod,
and the results of the three experiments measuring equivalent shim- and.
regulating-rod combinations were next combined with a theoretical formule
for the reactivity worth of an arbitrary shim-regulating rod configuration.
The theoretical formule contained several parameters which were adjusted
so that the formula provided a least squares fit to the experimental
measurements. Derivation of the formula for the rod worth and dlscussion
of its application are given in Ref. 3. The result of this analysis is
shown in Figure 1. Here, the solid sample points are taken from smooth
curves through the experimental data. As Figure 1 indicates, the smoothed
data could be fitted very closely with the theoretical rod-worth formula,
except for small errors at the extreme positions of the rods (full inser-
tion or withdrawal). No important restrictions in the use of the formula

arise from these errors, since its purpose is primarily for interpolating

for the reactivity worth of intermediate shim-regulating rod combinations
not specifically covered in the three groups of experiments described
above, It provides a convenient means of rapidly calculating the reac~
tivity equivalent of the rod configuration during reactor operation, by
means of the BR-340 on-line computer. One restriction in the practical
use of the formule on which Figure 1 is based should be noted, however.
It should only be applied in regions of rod travel and excess reactivity
covered in the zero-power calibration experiments (i.e., magnitude of

reactivity less than or equal to the worth of a single rod, moving. through

51 inches of travel). Modifications of the least-squares formula would be

required to cover a larger reactivity range.

Excess~-Uranium Reactivity Worth

Relative to the reference conditions defined in the preceding part
of this report, the total excess 2357 is equal to the amount added during
the zero-power experiments, minus the amount burned during power operation
of the reactor, plus the amount added to re-enrich the fuel salt when the
burnup becomes sufficient. Corrections must also be introduced for rela-
tive dilution effects each time the reactor fuel loop is drained and mixed
with the fuel salt "heel" remaining in the drain tanks during operation.

The reactivity equivalent of the excess uranium was determined from
‘the zero-pover experiments by measuring the amount of control-rod insertion
required to balance each addition of 235y, then using the independent cali-
bration of reactivity vs position to determine the incremental reactivity
worth of the 57, “Results of these measurements, expressed in terms of a

concentration coefficient of reactivity, gave 0.223% increase in reactivity

for a 1% increase in 235U concentration. This was within approximately 5
agreement with the theoretical calculations of this quantity.

Temperature-Ievel Reactivity Effect

When the core temperature is maintained spatially uniform, a change
in this temperature can be related both experimentally and theoretically
to the core reactivity in an unambiguous manner. The method used to =
measure the isothermal temperature coefficient of reactivity during the
Zero-power experiments consisted of varying the external heater inputs and
allowing the just critical reactor to cool slowly and uniformly while
measuring the change in regulating-rod position’ required to maintain a
constant neutron level. In these experiments, the fuel was circulating
and the system temperature was taken to be the average of a preselected
set of thermocouples distributed over the circulating system. The change

in rod position corresponding to the temperature change was converted to

reactivity by again using the rod calibration curve.” These experiments
measured the combined effect of a uniform change in fuel and graphite
temperature. The measured total isothermal temperature coefficient of
reactivity was -7.3 x 1075 (°F~1).
Experiments were also performed to separate the component effect of
fuel and graphite temperatures.l This was done by stopping the fuel circu-
lating pump, raising the temperature of the circulating coolant salt as
well as the stagnant fuel salt in the heat exchanger, then restarting the
fuel pump to pass fuel salt that was hotter than the graphite through the
core, The reactor was maintained critical with the power level controlled
by the flux servo. The change In control-rod position and the output of a

© thermocouple in the reactor-vessel outlet was logged digitally at quarter-

second intervals. The value of the fuel coefficient obtained from these
experiments was -4.9 x 107° (°F~1), about 20% higher in magnitude than the
calculated fuel temperature coefficient. These experiments, however, con-
tained a relatively large band of uncertainty due to the inherent diffi-

: culty in introducing proper time-dependent corrections.

Power Coefficient of Reactivity

-At power levels. higher than about 0 kw of heat, nomi form nuclear
heating of the core occurs, and produces spatial distributions of tempera-
ture in the graphite and fuel salt characteristic of the power level. The
reactivity change, relative to a fixed uniform temperature level, is no

| longer simply related to a single physically measurable temperature (or

even the average of several measured temperatures) in the circulating
system. Rather, the reactivity is a cumulative effect of the entire

temperature field in the core. This  temperatuve- distribution reactivity

effect, or steady-state power coefficient of reactivity, is somewhat
difficult to estimate reliably for the MSRE, because it requires accurate
knowledge of the local heat deposition and temperature distributions in .
the graphite end salt and the contribution of these local effects. to the
neutron reaction rates. An approximate way of treating this problem in-
volves the use of a "muclear average temperature,” as described. in Ref. lL.
In this method, the local temperature changes are multiplied by a weight-
ing (importance) function which measures their effect on.the net reac- -
tivity, then integrated over the reactor core. Even if we assume that the
temperature distributions in the fuel and core graphite can be calculated
accurately, one should note that the weighting procedure described. in

Ref, 4 may be intrinsically in error, when applied to a small reactor core
such as the MSRE. Here the principal temperature reactivity effects arise
from chenges in the neutron leakage. Although non-uniform temperature
changes induce expansion in fuel salt and graphite which do affect the re-
activity according to the weighting procedure described above, they also
influence the thermal neutron spectrum in a more complex, non-local

manner.

The power coefficient of reactivity for a fixed reactor outlet tempera-

“ture was measured during the approach to power, by holding the reactor
outlet temperature at a preset value with the servo controller, and measur-
ing the control-rod response to the change in steady-state power level.
Since the reactivity response to the change in temperature distribution is
essentially instantaneous, this effect can be separated from the slower
power-dependent reactivity effects such as xenon-135 and samarium-149. The

 

The temperature distributions in fuel and graphite are determined by
the total power level and the mode of temperature level control (the ‘reactor
outlet fuel temperature is servo-controlled in the MSRE). Since the power
level is an input variable to the on-line computer, it is convenient to
relate the reactivity effect directly to the power level.

**To the authors’ knowledge, the theoretical problem of neutron
thermalization in a moderator with a non-{niform temperature field has
not yet been completely resolved.

measured power ‘coefficient was +0.001% reactivity per Mw compared to &
calculated value of -0.00T%. The observed coefficient corresponds to a
difference of 22°F between the nuclear average temperature of the graphite
and that of the fuel at 7.2 Mw; the calculated temperature difference was
32°F. This sensitivity of the power coefficient to changes in core tempera-
tures results from the fact that it represents a small difference between
two larger values (the positive reactivity effect of the fuel average
temperature and the negative effect of the graphite average temperature).
As with the other terms in Eq. 1 in which experimental results can be
applied directly, we emphasize that the measured power coefficient is
used in the overall reactivity balance eguation. RE

Semarium Poisoning

| The direct fission production-decay schemes for the high-cross-section
isotopes 149m and 151Sm are shown in Figure 2. The numerical values of
effective removal constants due to neutron absorption, 9,9 given in
Figure 2, are normalized to 1 Mw and corrected for the time the fuel spends

"in the part of the circulating loop external to the reactor core. In

principle, the chains shown in Figure 2 should be connected by neutron
absorption in 59m; other indirect routes for the production of 149m. can
also be considered.® However, for the relatively low neutron flux and
fraction of uranium burnup engendered in the MSRE, these corrections can be
neglected. For periodic calculation with the BR-340 on-line computer, the
differential equations describing the production and decay schemes in

Figure 2 were converted to. finite difference form. The form of the equations
used for computation in both decay chains are: -

values of C; for the MSRE are 6.32 x 1031 and 2.46 x 101 atoms per: em®

The conversion of the samarium concentrations to a reactivity effect
requires knowledge of their average cross sections for absorption in the
MSRE neutron spectrum and the reactivity coefficient for a unit absorber
of this type, uniformly distributed in the MSRE fuel salt. In the MSRE
spectrum, all but a small fraction of the absorptions in the samarium
isotopes take place below about 0.9 ev. At 1200°F, the peak of the ‘thermal
spectrum is at approximately 0.09 ev, and 0.876 was chosen as the effective
cutoff for the thermal energy group, for reasons of convenience in theo-
retical computations. The absorption cross sections, averaged over the
neutron energy spectrum below and sbove this cutoff energy can be esti-
mated with & fair degree of reliability with presently available computer
codes. Effective absorption cross sections can then be obtained which give

Theoretical calculations of the coefficients which convert the samarium
absorption retes to reactivity effects must also be employed. since a

thermal absorber, uniformly distributed.in the MSRE fuel salt, was not
obtained from the zero-power experiments. It may be noted, however, that

considerable indirect support of the theoretical reactivity coefficient

for thermal absorption is given by the close comparison between the
measured and calculated 235U concentration coefficients of reactivity,

mentioned earlier in this report.

Xenon-135 Folsoning
’ Early estimates of the magnitude of xenon-135 poisoning were based

upon the assumption that, at equilibrium, a relatively large fraction of
~ the xenon. produced in the reactor would diffuse into the pores of the

graphite moderator and undergo radioactive decay and neutron ‘absorption
there. Continuous removal of some of the xenon from the fuel salt would
be accomplished by circulation of a small bypass stream of salt through
the spray ring. in ‘the fuel-pump tank, which contacts the salt with a
stream of helium gas. Estimates of the efficiency of removal of fission
gases by this stripping apparatus, and also of the expected mass transfer
of xenon to the graphite pores, were based on experiments performed prior
to the nuclear operation of the MSEE. S Although it was recognized that

the presence of any circulating voids (undissolved helium gas) would
drastically affect the xenon behavior, this aspect of the problem was |
first. neglected because there was no evidence that circulating voids
would be encountered. in the operation of the reactor.

During the zero-power operation, several tests were performed 1 to

evaluate the response of ‘the system reactivity to changes in overpressure. “-

 

x RE

“Most of the suggestions and ground work to provide an: interpretation -
of the xenon behavior in the MSRE. are due to R.- J. Kedl of the Engineering
Development Group.

 

 
 

1h

In these tests the system. pressure wes slowly increased by about 10 psi
and then rapidly reduced to the normal value. If circulating voids had
been present, their expansion when the pressure was reduced would have
expelled some salt from the core and reduced the nuclear reactivity. In
eddition, the gas expansion in the entire loop would have raised the salt
level in the fuel-pump tenk., There was no evidence of undissolved gas in
the tests performed with the normel ‘salt level in the pump tank. However,’
when the salt level was reduced to an abnormally low value, the seme ex-
periments did indicate 1 to 2 volume percent of undissolved gas. We con-
cluded from these tests that circulating voids would not be a factor in
the xenon poisoning during normal power operation. »

Soon after power operation of the reactor was started, 1t ‘became
apparent that the magnitude of the xenon-135 poisoning was much smaller
then had been predicted on the basis of the sbove considerations. At

this point the attempts at on-line calculation of the xenon poisoning vere

suspended and the reactivity-balance results were used. to measure the
actual xenon poisoning. Examination of the steady-state results shoved }
that the low poison level could not be accounted for vith reasonable oo

parameter values within the assumption of no circulating voids. | In ad- |

dition, the system response to small pressure changes now indicated a
smell circulating void fraction at normal salt levels in the pump tank.
Another set of pressure-release ‘tests was then performed which showed
significant pressure effects at normal conditions. If all of the observed
effects were attributed to circulating voids (as was done initielly), e

volumetric void fraction of 1 to 2% was indicated. However, the pressure-

release tests do not necessarily indicate the presence of this amount of
circulating voids prior to the pressure release; they only indicate that
they are present afterwards. That is the observed response could be ex-
plained by a stagnant void of fixed volume from which expanding ges could

escape to the circulating stream when the system pressure is reduced. Such

-& vold could be anywhere in the loop so long as its volume is unaffected

by pressure (e.g. voids into which salt cannot penetrate because of surface

tension). Further analysis of the pressure-release tests showed that most

of the excess gas that was in the loop after the pressure release was

removed very repidly; gas- stripping efficiencies of: 80° to 100% were

‘calculated,

In view of ‘the new evidence for circulating voids, the steady-state
xenon equations were modified to include bubbles and were reevaluated.
As expected, the steady-state xenon poisoning was quite sensitive to both -
the volumetric void fraction and the bubble-stripping efficiency. However,
it vas found that the ‘steady-state. xenon poisoning as a function: of reactor
power could be described by & variety of combinations of void fraction and
bubble-stripping efficiency. Therefore, the equations were rewkitten to

‘include the time ‘dependence which would permit a comparison of calculated

end observed transient 13SXe poisoning effects (as determined by the

- change in the critical position of the regulating rod during the 48 hours

following & change in the steady-state reactor power level). The purpose
was to attempt a separation of those parsmeter effects that could not be
separated in the steady-state correlations. The mathematical model used
to calculate the time behavior of the 135%e poisoning is described in
References T and 8. In the present section we will give only a quali-
tative description of the main aspects and assumptions in the model.
Further refinements of the model: for the xenon behavior may also be re-
quired in future operation. These refinements should not affect the major

‘conclusions: about the overall reactivity behavior.

In the model: chosen, we have assumed that all the 1odine-135 produced
from fission remains in circulation with the salt. After decay to xenon-135,
the xenon migrates to the accessible pores of the graphite at the boundaries
of the fuel channels and: also to minute helium bubbles distributed through
the circulating salt stream. “An effective mass-transfer coefficient was.

Similar considerations were assumed to apply to the mass transfer of
‘xenon from liquid solution to the gas bubbles. The coefficient of mess
transfer from the liquid to & small gas bubble, of ‘the order of 0.010 in.
in diameter, moving through the main part of & fuel channel, was estimated
from theoretical mass-transfer ‘correlations.® The equilibrium 1>Sxe
poisoning wes shown to be relatively insensitive. to the bubble diameter and
mass-transfer coefficient, over a reasonable range of uncertainty for these
paremeters. Se

Different efficiencies of removal by the external stripping apparatus
of xenon dissolved in the salt and that contained in the gas bubbles were .
provided for in the computational model. ‘The efficiency of removal
(fraction of xenon removed per unit circulated through the spray ring) of
xenon dissolved in the salt was estimated to be between 10 and 15%, based
on some early mock-up experiments to evaluate the performance of the xenon
removal epparatus. -

The conversion of the calculated 1°5Xe concentrations in salt, gas:
bubbles, and graphite pores to the corresponding reactivity poisoning
effect follows from considerations similar to those described in the pre-:-
ceding section for the samarium isotopes. Here, however, there is one :
special feature which should be accounted for which is not present inthe’
case of samarium. This is the non-uniformity of the spatial distribution
of the 1°S¥e in the graphite pores. In the graphite region, the 1>5Xe
tends to assume a "dished" shape, governed by the burnout of the xenon in.
the neutron flux. The concentration is minimum near the: center of. the re-
actor and maximum near the boundaries of the graphite region. This: in-
fluences the net reactivity effect, since these regions assume afgsseny
importances in determining reactivity changes. The calculation of this .

"shape correction" factor is described in Reference 7.

A computational study based. on the theoretical model described above
vas first performed "off line", with the eid of an. IBM 7090 program. . These
theoretical calculations were compared with the date logged by the ER-340..

In Figures 3 through 13, we have compared some of the transient reac-
tivity curves obtained from this analysis with some experimental transients,
in the chronological order in which they were obtained. In each of these
figures, the solid curves represent the calculated behavior and the plotted

 

points show the observed response from reactivity-balance results. A i
measurement of the 134Xe/136Xe ratio in a semple of the reactor offgas

taken at T.2 Mv with the xenon in steady state gave an independent value

for the magnitude of the 135xe poisoning which agreed well with the

reectivity-balance results. At this date, only a few relatively clean

‘experimental transients corresponding to step changes in power level (for

which the T090 program was devised) have been obtained. ‘However, several
characteristics of ‘the 135ye ‘behavior are indicated from these curves.
These will be discussed by considering the figures. in order.

Figure 3 shows the calculated and observed xenon transients for a

relatively low efficiency is equal to the efficiency estimated for the

stripping of xenon dissolved in the salt; it was used as a first approxi- -

mation because at the time there was no basis for assuming a higher velue
for the bubbles. The effectiveness of the circulating gas in reducing the

poison level is due to the combined effects of the large overall gas= liquid

surface area, for mass transfer to the bubbles and of the large xenon-
storage capability of the bubbles - (because of the extreme insolubility of
xenon in molten salt). Thus, the bubbles compete effectively with the
graphite for removal of xenon from the liquid and xenon in the circulating

fluid is a less effective polson than that in the graphite because about
two-thirds of the fluid is outside the core at any instant, The plotted

points represent the observed 135Xe reactivity transient at the beginning

of Reactor Run No. 7 (July 1, 1966). The data indicate that the low
apparent xenon poisoning at steady state could be explained by & large
void fraction (between 0.5 and 1.0 vol%) and a low bubble-stripping

‘efficlency. However, the transient buildup is not closely fitted by these

parameter values,
“In Figure lL, the curves indicate the calculated effect of increasing

the bubble-stripping efficiency for a fixed, relatively small (0.1 vol)

circulating void fraction. The plotted points are for the same reactor

xenon transient shown in Fig. 3. A comparison of Figs. 3 and 4 shows

that the steady-state xenon poisoning is described as well by a low void

fraction with a high bubble-stripping efficiency as it 1s by & high void

fraction with a low stripping efficiency. However, the shape of the

transient is described much more closely by the parameter values in Fig. h.
Figures 5 and 6 show the calculated and observed transient buildup

of 135%Xe poisoning after a step increase in power from zero to 5.7 Mw in

Run No. 8 (October, 1966).  The>ranges of values of a end < used in

these calculations are the same as those used for Figs. 3.and kh. Again,

the shape of the observed transient is matched more closely by the calcu-

lations which assume & low void fraction and a high bubble- stripping
efficiency. Thus, it appears that the initial assumption of a low stripping
efficiency for the bubbles was incorrect. The higher stripping efficiency
not only. fits the: ‘xenon transients’ ‘better, it is also consistent. with the

rates of excess gas removal observed in the pressure-release experiments.

Since the latter experiments do not define ‘the void fraction unambiguously,

the low void fraction that must be ‘associated with a high stripping
efficiency is also in agreement with all the data.

about the seme information about the bubble parameters as the earlier
- ‘xenon bulldup transients, ~The calculated curves also reveal an important
‘characteristic of the transient xenon behavior which is due to variations

in the overall xenon distribution that result from the choice ‘of values for
o, ‘and € - If the circulating void fraction is low, most of the poisoning
effect 1s due to xenon in the graphite and only a small amount of xenon is
in the circulating fluid. Xenon that is produced in the fluid from iodine
decay continues to migrate to the graphite for a period of time after the

power has been reduced. This produces a shutdown peak in the xenon

poisoning. Eventually, the stripping process reduces the xenon concen-
tration in the fluid so that some of the xenon in the graphite can escape
and be stripped out. This results. in a more rapid decrease. in xenon
poisoning than simple radioactive decay. As the circulating void fraction
1s increased, & larger fraction ‘of the xenon inventory (or poisoning) is
associated with the bubbles ‘and there is less xenon migration to the
graphite.” In this case the shutdown peak tends to disappear. This effect

makes the shape of the shutdown transients more sensitive to changes in

the values assumed for the bubble parameters and thus facilitates the
process of fitting the observed data to the calculations. -

For this seme limited decay transient, Figure 9. shows the effect of
the bubble-stripping efficiency with a slightly larger volume fraction of
circulating gas bubbles (0. 15 vol%). Although the data for this particular
transient are somewhat scattered, the combined results from Figures 3
through 9 suggest that a and € might be bracketed between 0. 1 and 0.15
vol%, and 50 to 100% respectively. Co SE :

A second 1°SXe stripping out-decay transient, observed during

Run No. 9 (November, 1966), following reduction in the power ‘level from
7.4 Mw to zero, is plotted in Figures 10 and 11. Again, the approximate

ranges given above for oy, and € are in agreement with the experimental

observations of the shape of the transient and the data show clearly the

small xenon peak expected for these parameter values.

“Finally, in Figures 12: and. 13, we show the most recent shutdown transi-
ent obtained at the termination of Run No. 10 (January 1k, 1967). In this
case, the apparent 135Ye reactivity transient was recorded for more than

40 hours. after the reduction in power level. These results indicate
strongly that the tentative conclusions reached from the earlier compari-
sons are ‘essentially correct. -

Although ‘substantial’ progress has been made in interpreting the xenon
behavior in the MSRE, the experimental data which have thus far been accumu-
lated for the transient behavior of the °SXe poisoning are as yet insuf-
ficient to provide a rigid test of our model for analysis. As one example,
it should be noted that, if gas bubbles are continuously being ingested
into the main circulating stream as the evidence indicates, the volume of
ges in circulation is probably not constant, but rather is a slowly varying
quantity depending on the level of the liquid in the fuel -pump tank and

the transfer rate of salt to the overflow tank. This dependence is as

yet not well understood, and future operation is expected to shed further
light in this area. - :

We should also mention that least- squares methods can be employed to
determine the unknown parameters in the theoretical model for the 13SXe
behavior which provide a closest fit to the experimental transients. -How-
ever, these methods contain several pitfalls (primarily relating to the

uniqueness, and hence to the. interpretation of the results) when two or

more parameters in the differential equations describing the process are
to be determined simultaneously. Their success is best assured if ground-

work is Pirst completed by a broad parameter study such as that summarized

here. We are now.at the point where least-squares techniques will be
useful in further refining the conclusions. .

Based: on the results of the off-line analysis with: the: THI-TO%0,
epproximate equations and parameters were determined for the ER-340. Co
on-line calculation of the *35Ye reactivity effect. Similar to the case
of the samarium poisoning calculation, these are finite difference equa-

tions, of the form given below:

In these equations, I*>S is the concentration of iodine-135 in the"
circulating salt, and X15 is the concentration of xenon-135, with. sub-

scripts s, g, and b representing the components in solution, in the graphite

pores, and in the circulating helium bubbles, respectively. The parameters
ao. through a,- are determined from the analysis described in the preceding
‘pages, and depend on the fission yields, radioactive decay constants, ma.ss-
transfer coefficients, bubble characteristics, and external stripping
efficiencies. The factor F is & shape correction factor for the component
of the 135Xe poisoning in the graphite. Although this is actually a time
dependent quantity, in the ER-340 program we are presently using a constant
value, equal to the correction calculated under equilibrium conditions
(Fr~0.8at P= 7.5 Ma).

As further experience is accumulated from operation of ‘the MSRE,
efforts will be made to refine the analysis summarized in this section.

Density Effects of Circulating Bubbles on Reactivity

In addition to its. indirect influence on the reactivity through re-

duction of the 135xe poisoning, the entrainment of undissolved helium in
"the circulating salt also directly affects reactivity by. increasing the
‘neutron leakage from the reactor core. This "fuel-salt density coefficient
of reactivity" wes estimated earlier as part of the analysis of core physics
‘characteristics summarized in Ref. k. The value obtained vas -0. 18% reac-

tivity for one volume percent of circulating gas bubbles.

‘Measurements ‘were made ‘during the zero-power experiments to evaluate
the reactivity effect due to fuel circulation, At thet time.there was no
evidence of circulating voids and the measured reactivity effect was -0.21%,
in good agreement. with the calculated decrease due to the loss of delayed
neutrons. This measurement was repeated-in October, 1966, after the
analysis of the 135%e poisoning had indicated a ‘circulating void fraction
of 0.1 to O. 15 vol. Prior to the start of circulation, the fuel salt had
been stored in a drain “tank for 11 weeks 50 it should have been free of
undissolved. ges. The observed reactivity change between no circulation
and circulation at steady state this time was -0. 23 to -0.25%, an increase
of 0.02 - 0.04%. If the amount of gas normally in circulation is approxi-

mately O, 1 to 0. 15 vols, this means that the density-reactivity effect

would be in the range of -.02 to. -.03% reactivity. Although this result
does not prove the existence of circulating voids, it is at least con-

sistent with the xenon results. Because. the actual amount of gas in ecircu-

lation appears to vary. somewhat uring operation (see also: later section
‘deseribing operational experience at the. MSRE), the magnitude of this

“explicit tern in the ER-340 on-line reactivity balance calculations. Hence,

Isotope Burnout Effects

" We have already mentioned in ‘an earlier section that , changes in the
isotopic concentrations of 1ithium-6, uranium-234, -236, and -238,
plutonium-239, and non=saturating fission products, all in the salt, and

residual boron-10 in the grephite can be lumped together as a single cate- >
gory in terms of their effect on the reactivity of ‘the core. Most of these
effects manifest themselves as very slowly developing positive reactivity
changes, dependent on the time-integrated ‘power, or energy generated. The
exceptions are 236y (for which there is a slight increase in concentration.
resulting from radiative capture in 235) and the buildup of non-saturating
fission-product poisons. .

In the MSRE, the 235U consumed per year's operation at 1. 5 Mw is )
3.56 kg, or epproximately 5 percent of the initial fuel charge. Because
this represents & relatively low fractional burnup of the fuel, and be-
cause each of “the reactivity effects mentioned above is a small correction
in the net reactivity balance, we can make convenient first-order approxi-
mations in calculating these effects. For this purpose, we- have assumed
that the magnitude and energy spectrum of the neutron flux remain con-
stant during operation at a given power level, and have used calculated
effective cross sections for neutron reactions in this spectrum. With
these assumptions, it is a straightforvard exercise to obtain the solutions
to the differential equations governing the first-order changes in isotopic .
concentrations with exposure to the neutron flux. We will omit description
of the algebraic details of these calculations. For ‘all isotopes but
boron-10, account has to be taken of the "flux dilution" effect of the
time the fuel spends in the section of the loop that is external to the
core. Thus the calculated volume-average thermal flux" for the entire
fuel loop is 0.665 x 1012 n/en? sec/Mv, whereas the average thermal flux
over the graphite-moderated region of the core is 2.0 x 10*2 n/em® sec /Mv.

The boron concentration initially in the MSRE graphite was estimated from
Ref. 9 to be about 0.8 ppm. In the calculation of the boron ‘burnout, we
have neglected a correction factor accounting for the spatial dependence
of burnout in the graphite region, since the total effect is quite smell.

"EXPERIENCE WITH THE ON-LINE CAICUIATION

.Reactivity-balance calculations have been performed for the MSRE since
the start of reactor operation at significant power. During the very early
stages of the operation, many of the calculations were done manually while
the computer progrem was being checked.out. ‘Such calculations were feasi-
ble at that time because the terms which depend on integrated power. were
negligibly smell. Subsequently the on-line computer was used to execute
modified reactivity balances. to provide data for evaluating the xenon-

polsoning term. At present, the complete reactivity balance is calculated

routinely by the computer every 5 minutes and the results are used without

further modification during normal operation. However, it is still neces-

sary to manually calculate the dilution effects that. occur when the fuel
loop is drained, Since shutdown operations may involve a variety of fuel
and flush-salt transfers, each shutdown must be treated as a special case.
Low-Power Calculations

The first operation of the MSRE after the zero-power experiments and
hence, the first opportunity to apply the reactivity-balence calculation
occurred in December, 1965, and Jamuery - February, 1966, during a series
of low-power experiments. (The intervening period, July - December, 1965,
wes spent. in completing those ‘parts of the system that were required for

“power operation. ) The reactor was operated at a variety of powers up to

1 Mw and a total of 36.5 Mwhr of fission energy was produced in these tests.
During the control-rod. calibration, capsules of enriched fuel were =

added to the ‘loop with the ‘sempler- enricher, and at the end ‘of the zero-

power experiments, the 25y concentration in the primary loop was about 110%

greater ‘than thet in the salt heel which remained in the drain tenks. Thus,
when. the reactor. vas drained. in July, 1965, a substantial ailution occurred
 vaich had to be ‘accounted for in the reactivity balance.

Since the computer program for the on-line calculation was not ready
for service during the low-power tests, ‘manual ‘calculations were. performed.

“However, the analytic expression for control-rod poisoning and. the. various

reactivity coefficients. that were being tncorporated. in ‘the computer
 

 

38

‘program were applied. Since very little integrated power was produced,
the xenon, samarium, burnup, and other- fission-product terms were
neglected. .

At low power these calculations provided a test of those terms in the
belence-that do not depend directly on power operation, i.e. control-rod
poisoning, variations in operating temperature, and changes in 2357 con-
centration. They also gave some indication of- the inherent accuracy of
the calculation under the simplest conditions.” These calculations gave a
residual reactivity of 40.01 * 0.01% 8k/k. This residual was attributed
- to uncertainties in the physical inventory in the system and was elimi-
nated from subsequent reactivity balances. That is,.the reference con-
dition for the reactivity balance. was established as the system condition
just before the start of power operation. In addition to verifying the
"zero-power" reactivity balance, the calculations at.l Mw gave en early -
indication thet the power coefficient of reactivity was less negative then
had been calculated and that the xenon poisoning would be less than we had
expected. (See also pp 9 - 11 and 13 - 32. ) As a result of these and
later findings, experiments were performed to evaluate these two terms.

Intermediate Calculations

Operation of the reactor at powers and for times that produced sig-
nificant fission-product terms began in April, 1966. This operation soon
showed that the xenon term was inadequately. treated and that part of the
calculation was temporarily deleted from subsequent computations. The
calculation results from the other terms in the reactivity balance were
then used to aid in the ‘development of an adequate representation of the
xenon poisoning. CT

| In order to use the reactivity balance to evaluate xenon poisoning, it
was necessary to assume that there were no other unaccounted-for reactivity
effects. This assumption was not completely valid for the early calcu-
‘lations because of long-term effects that were neglected, but it was valid
for the relatively short times involved in the xenon transients. Since
most of the data for the xenon calculation were developed from the reac-
tivity transients after the reactor power was raised or lowered

N

 
a

39

(see pp 13 - 32) the early errors in the long-term reactivity balances

were of ‘little consequence.

Figure 1b shows the results of reactivity-balance calculations without
xenon for ‘all power operation of the reactor between April and July, 1966.
The reactor power is shown with each reactivity ‘plot. for reference. pur-
poses. The reactivity transients associated with the buildup and removal
of xenon due to changes in power are clearly displayed. The apparent
steady-state xenon poisoning at maximum power t~ 7.2 Mv) is 0.25 to
0.30% 8k/k.

"The large negetive-reactivity transient on June 18 - 19 was caused

by the development of a large. circulating void fraction in the fuel loop.

It wes Known that if the fuel-salt level in the pump tank were allowed
to decrease below a given value, the amount qf gas in circulation would
increase significantly. This condition was reached on June 18 and the
accompenying decrease in average fuel density produced the reactivity
decrease. The reactivity recovered rapidly when the normal pump-tank
level was restored and the excess gas was stiipped out. The response of
the reactivity balance in this event illustrates the sensitivity of this
method for detecting minor anomalies under otherwise normal circumstances.
The reactivity balances calculated for the period shown in Figure 1h
were not completely corrected for long-term isotopic change effects or
for flush-salt dilution, This is illustrated by the apparent increase
in the residual reactivity at zero-power when there was no xenon present.
(Note especially the results on April 11, May 9, June 13, and July 1 and’

21-23.) Corrections for these factors were subsequently applied to. the -

zero-powver balances to evaluate as accurately as ‘possible. the: long-term

drift in ‘the residual reactivity.

Complete Celeulations

The complete reactivity balance calculation, ‘including all ‘known
effects, vas first ‘applied to the period of reactor operation which began
in October, 1966. Figure 15 shows the power history and residual reac-
tivity results on a day-to-day basis for the next three runs (the reac-
tivity scale in Figure 15 is expanded from that of the preceding figure).

During steady-state operation the results show only minor variations in
the residual reactivity. However, in October and November there is still
some indication of a disagreement between the calculated and actual xenon
poisoning, both in the absolute magnitude of the term and in the transient
behavior. The results for December, 1966 and January, 1967 show better
transient agreement but still some difference in the magnitude of the
xenon term. :
The larger spikes in residual reactivity can all be accounted for by

‘ebnormal reactor conditions which are not covered in the reactivity balance.

For example, the spikes on October :10 are associated with speciel experi-
ments during which gas bubbles were circulating with the salt. Fuel-salt
circulation was interrupted for 2-1/2 hours on October 16 and no xenon
stripping occurred. When circulation and power operation were resumed,
the actual xenon-poison level was higher than that calculated in the re-
activity balence which assumed continuing circuletion and stripping while
the power was low. On October 23, the salt level in the pump tank was at
an sbnormally high level for a brief period. The xenon stripping was much
less effective in this condition and the xenon-poison level rapidly built
up to a higher value. When a more normal salt level was restored, the
xenon poisoning returned to the normal value. oo

The perturbations in residual reactivity during the November operation
resulted from failure of the calculation to adequately describe the xenon
transients. During this run it was necessary to reduce the power on
several occasions because of conditions imposed by the reactor offgas
system. In each case the observed xenon behavior was about the same, indi-
cating a longer time constant for xenon stripping than wes calculated in
the model. This disparity in the time constants produced the eyelie be-
havior that was observed.

Considerable difficulty was encountered in die cpp of the on-
line computer during the last period of operation shown in Figure 15. As
& result, substantial gaps exist in the complete reactivity-belence re-
sults. However, the available results are in good agreement with the ex-
pected behavior. Again, the spikes on December 23 and 24 end Jemuary 12
reflect abnormal reactor operations which resulted in circulating voids.

-“

 
43

The smaller variations (see, for example, the period from December 30 to
Jemiary 5) appear to be related to.variations in the -fuel-system over-
pressure. They may reflect changes in the circulating void fraction or
veriations in the net xenon-stripping efficiency. Additional detailed
analyses will be required to identify the cause of these small variations.

Long-Term Residual Reactivity

The long-term drift in residual reactivity can best be seen in the
calculation results where there is no xenon present. In order to make
this comparison, representative results of this kind have been converted
to & common basis using current values for all coefficients, The mejor
corrections that were applied to earlier results were to compensate for

_ long-term isotopic-change effects that had been neglected and for flush-
salt dilution effects. Each time the fuel loop is drained a small heel
of the salt that vas circulating remains in the loop. This salt then

mixes with the material that is next introduced into the loop. When the
reactor 1s shut down for maintenance the fuel loop is normally rinsed
with flush salt to remove as much residual radioactivity as possible.

Then, when the loop is refilled with fuel salt, the remaining flush-salt

heel produces a dilution of the fuel. Some additional intermixing occurs
because & common £111-and-drain line 1s used for the two salts. The extent
of the salt intermixing was determined from the amount of uranium that

has appeared in the otherwise-barren flush salt. Chemical analyses of

the flush salt indicated the amount of fuel salt that was picked up by the
flush selt in various operations. We then assumed that a similar volume
of flush salt is added to the fuel. The net result of a flush-salt fill
end drain followed by a fuel-salt fill is to reduce the system reactivity

by about 0.05%. oo

The corrected: resctivity-belence results at zero ‘power with no xenon
present are shown: as a function of integrated power in Figure 16. It
should be noted that the reactivity scale 1s greatly expanded end thet the

average residual reactivity is only about +0.05 8k/k. There appears to

| have been a positive shift of about +0. ok to +0.05% 8k/k early in the
operation with insignificant changes occurring subsequently.

Through the end of Run No. 10 (January, 1967) the reactor had pro-
quced 16,450 Mir-hrs, equivalent to 95 days' operation at maximum power
and substantial changes had occurred in many of the reactivity-balance
terms. Table 2 shows typical values for the various terms in the reac-
tivity balance at the start of power operation and at the end of Run 10.
The values given represent zero-power operation with no xenon present to
emphasize the long-term effects. The estimated accuracies of the various
terms are included in the table for later consideration (see pp 47 - 48).
This table shows. clearly the current value of the residual reactivity

INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS

 

Previous Reports of Results = Sa ~ |

The results presented in this report represent our current evaluation
of the reactivity behavior of the MSRE during the first year of power
operation. In the course of this year the accumulation of data and experi-
ence has resulted in & number of changes in the calculation of various

“terms as well as in the Interpretation of the results. Because of the

interest in the performance of the MSRE and the value of the reactivity
balance in assessing that performance, intermediate results have ‘been
reported from time to time (see especially Reference 10) even though it
was recognized that further analysis was required for an accurate inter-
pretation. ‘Some of these results suggested the possibility that the posi-

tive residual reactivity was gradually increasing. This apparent increase

was due to an inadequate treatment of long- term changes in ‘minor salt

constituents and to a misinterpretation of conflicting data on the cireyla-

ting void fraction.

Tt is to be expected that ‘additional modifications. Will ‘be mede in
our treatment of the reactivity balance as more operating: experience. is
accumulated. However, we feel that ‘any future refinements will have small
effects and that the current evaluation is reasonably accurate.

Utility of Residual Reactivity

The residuel reactivity as determined from the reactivity valance
cannot -be used by itself as an absolute indicator of the reactor per- -
formance. Because of the experimental nature of the. MSEE and the variety
of unknowns associated with the reactivity behavior, particularly in re-
gard to xenon ‘poisoning, it was necessary to use the reactor behavior as
a tool in ‘developing the reactivity balance. During ‘this development it
was necessary to assume that no anomalous reactivity effects were ‘present.
This assumption was supported by a variety of other observations: the
melear stability both at steady power and during ‘transients, a comparison
of predicted and atrectly observable nuclear characteristics, chemical
analyses of fuel-salt samples, and examlnation of in-core irradiation and

 

corrosion specimens. Even after its development, ‘the reactivity balance
must ‘be used in ‘conjunction with these other observations to insure that
no neglected, ‘but otherwise normal, reactivity-effect is interpreted as
an anomaly.

~~ The reactivity balance 1s potentially one of the most sensitive indi~
cators of changing conditions. in a system like the MSRE. However, there
are certainly limitations in both the precision and absolute accuracy of

“such calculations.’ At steady reactor conditions (constant - temperature,

pressure, and pover) the variation in consecutive reactivity balences is
only about 0. 01% ok/k. This is associated. primarily with variations in
the temperature and control-rod-position readings from. the computer and,
therefore, probably represents. the precision Limit of the calculation.

t cL It is difficult to provide a ‘reliable estimate of the confidence oo
Limits of the calculations summarized in this report. To a large ‘extent,
refinements in the analysis to include effects found to be. significant,
together with reinterpretations of. measurements, have to be performed

“of reactivity effects Important in operation are often interwoven, so
‘that operational data taken in connection with one particular effect have .

shed further. light on earlier ‘measurements pertaining to other effects.
This process is expected to continue,
 

48

Because several of the most important terms in the reactivity balance
(control-kod worth, excess *>5U, temperature levels) are based on measure-
ments made during the ZE€TO-power nuclear experiments, a rough basis for
discussing the accuracy of these terms is provided by those experiments. -
As mentioned in en earlier section, independent messurements of the oo
control-rod worth (by means of period-differentiel worth experiments and
rod drop-integral worth experiments) were found to be self consistent,
within 5%. Also, the interpretation of other ‘reactivity effects (sy
concentration coefficient, overall temperature coefficient, and delayed-
neutron losses) based on the rod calibration were within 5% of the calecu~
lated values. Thus, reasonable confidence limits are probably. + 2.5% on
terms for which experimental measurements are available and + 5% on terms
for which only calculations are available. Application of these limits to
the changes in reactivity léads to an uncertainty of * O. ough 8k/k in the
residual reactivity at zero power with no xenon present. (See also
Table 2, p 46.) | | |

~The very small uncertainty in the residual reactivity makes this 8
very sensitive monitor of conditions in the MSRE. By comparison, sta-
tistical analysis of the results of chemical analyses of fuel-salt samples
gave & change in 2257 concentration of -0.025 + 0.013 wt% between the
start of power operation and 16,450 Mw-hrs.'! This corresponds to &
reactivity change of -0.36 + 0.18% ®k/k which can be directly compared
with the reactivity-balance value of -0.43 + 0.01% 8k/k in Table 2. - Thus,
while both the reactivity balances and the chemical results indicate normal
behavior the reactivity balances are somewhat more accurate in this par-

ticular application and are contimiously available during reactor operation.

Effects: Not Treated | Co

Several effects have been mentioned which have not been explicitly
included in the reactivity-balance calculations, and for which cognizance
should be taken. These include the production of photoneutrons through
(7,n) reactions in the beryllium and neutron absorptions in the products
which result from reactions that are evaluated. Since only changes in
reactivity relative to the reference condition are observed in the re-
activity balance, one may show by approximate calculation that the magnitude

of these effects should have negltginie direct effect on the reactivity
balance in the MSRE. - Co Co

"Of potentially ta te the teeta fmm 4h be
present but not accounted for are (1) the slight changes in the structural

configuration of the graphite stringers and salt channels due to neutron

irradiation demage to the graphite, and (2) the cumulative effects of

‘irradiation on the control-rod worth (through burnup of the gadolinium).
Both these effects should appear as slow changes in the residual reactivity.

Radiation damage 1s expected to cause the graphite to shrink, thereby
reducing slightly the axial dimensions of the core, increasing the ef-
fective graphite density, and causing some bowing of the stringers due to
the radial gradient in the neutron flux. It 1s difficult to provide a
precise estimate of the change in core’ reactivity associated with this
effect, but a reported estimate which should be on the conservative side
(larger than the actual magni tude) is about +.07% 8k/k per Mw yr.12
Although this 1s in the range which might be detected in the residual re- -
activity, no consistent,’ “slowly increasing: change of this magnitude has
been observed in the reactivity.

In the second case, above, rough calculations supported by comparative
observations in the reactor, have indicated that the effect of burnout of
the gadolinium on rod reactivity 1s of negligible significance in ‘the MSRE
operation to date, However, corrections for this effect should properly’
be accounted for as operation continues into a. substantial fraction of the
core life. A thorough analysis of this effect is planned in the immediate

future.

Operating imitations Ee |

In the MSEE operating authorization, the SARC recommended. ‘that :
‘allowable limits on reactivity anomalies should be established and docu-
mented before critical tests begin and should be adhered to during all
operations. "13 This was, and is being, done. The operating limits on. the

~ MSRE include this one. "At no time. during critical operation of the re-
actor will The reactivity anos ly ‘be allowed to exceed 0.5% Ski. "4
 

50

The limit of 0.5% was set in consideration of the consequences ofa -/
very pessimistic hypothetical incident involving separated urenium. It
was postulated that uranium separated from the circulating fuel by some
unspecified process and collected in the lower head of the ‘reactor .
vessel." Then something caused part of the uranium. to be. resuspended and
sucked up through the central channels in the core in a .single blob. (The
velocity in 22 channels near the center is 2.0 ft/sec, almost three times
the velocity in the 940 channels covering the main body of the core.)

The computations were done as follows.1S The shape of ‘the reactivity
transient due to movement of & blob of urantumup through a central channel
‘was computed. Then the transients in power, temperature, and core pressure
were computed for various amounts of added reactivity and different initial
power levels. No account was teken of rod scram, only the shutdown pro-
vided by the negative temperature coefficient of reactivity. The computed
power excursions were brief, producing sharp but momentary increases in
the temperature of the fuel in the core (but little change in grephite
temperature) end pressure surges in the core due to fuel-salt expansion.
A tolerable excursion (one which would not be expected to cause damage)
was defined as one in which the pressure surge was less than 50 psig and
the peek fuel temperature was less than 1800°F. The limit was reached by
incidents in which the reactivity addition peaked at 0.7% 8k/k. The oo
amount of excess uranium that would give this reactivity was computed to.
be 0.8 kg (neglecting self-shielding in the blob, which would increase the
amount of uranium required). |

The next step was to decide what fraction of a uranium deposit might
reasonably be pictured as becoming detached and passing through the: core
as postulated, In HRE-2 (an aqueous fluid-fuel reactor where fuel separa-
tion could and did occur), deposits could be dispersed by movement of the .
loose core-inlet screens in the turbulent flow, or by steam formation, and

under the conditions maintained in the MSRE.

the dispersed material was soluble. "Even under these conditions the

-largest sudden recovery of uranium was less than 0.1 of the existing de-

posits. In the MSRE, on the ‘other hand, deposits of uranium as UOp should
be quite stable so the probability of resuspension of any significant
fraction should be quite small. Therefore, we considered that an assump-
tion of sudden resuspension of 10 percent of the separated uranium was
quite conservative. = T

With the foregoing pessimistic assumptions, ‘one computes that the

separation: of 8 kg of ‘uranium is the maximum smount tolerable. If this

“much were to ‘separate from the circulating fuel and collect in a region of

low nuclear importance, the reactivity would decrease by 0.5% Bk/k. This
was set then ‘as the maximum allowable reactivity anomaly.

Conclusions

Several conclusions can be — from the experience with the
reactivity-balance calculation during the first year of power operation of
the MSRE., The calculation has provided an invaluable tool for evaluating

the performance of the reactor system, particularly in connection with the
xenon-polsoning problem. The results have been accurate and precise enough

to permit a detailed analysis and evaluation of mechanisms which would

otherwise have been largely indeterminate in the reactor. In addition,

‘they: have provided the operating’ staff with a real-time mond tor of the

"condition of the reactor system.

‘Possibly the most importent conclusion is that the reactivity balance

hes’ shown, within very narrow confidence limits, no anomalous reactivity

behavior. during this first year of power ‘operation. The long- term change
that has occurred is: lower than: ‘the ‘allowable. anomaly by a factor of 10
and there have been no. unexplained short-term deviations. This experience

shows with: considerable. ‘confidence that the reactor has performed &s. ex-

pected in all respects that could affect the miclear reactivity.
