ABSTRACT

(The zirconium fluoride~base fluoride mixture NaF-ZrF -UF 4 (50-46-4 mole %), referred to as “fluoride 30,"
was circulated in Inconel thermal convection loops for periods varying from 500 ta 5000 hr and of a hot-leg tempera-
ture of 1500°F.
companying the circulation of zirconium fluoride—base mixtures in Inconel.

 

The purpose of this program was fo develop an understanding of the corrosion mechanism ac-

The attack in the Inconel loops was in the form of subsurface voids formed by selective leaching of chromium
from the alloy. After 500 hr of operation the voids were found to depths of about 10 mils, with the depth continuing
to increase at a rate of about 4 mils per 1000 hr of operation. The effects of such variables as time, hot-leg temper-
ature, temperature drop, fluoride purity, loop size and shape, and inhibitors on the depth of corrosion were studied.
It wos found that the attack was reduced when a portion of the uranium wos present in the trivalent state, but the

results were not reproducible. )

CONCLUSIONS

From the data presented in this report it may be
concluded that molten mixtures of NaF, ZrF,, and
UF, may be circulated for several thousand hours
in low-velocity nonisothermal Inconel systems.
After 2000 hr of operation the corrosion depth in
such a system will be deeper than desirable but
will still not be excessive. A depth of about
0.010 in. will be reached in 500 hr; after this the
depth will increase at a rate of 0,004 in. per
additional 1000 hr of operation.

The corrosion of the Inconel takes place by
selective leaching of chromium metal from the
hotter surface of a nonisothermal system. The
removed chromium is replaced on the surface by
diffusion from the center, but since no inward
diffusion takes place, voids
surface of the metal.

The principal removal reaction is

UF, + Cr — UF, + CF,

form under the

accompanied by the reverse reaction to form
chromium metal in the cold leg. With short
operating times a large portion of the attack
takes place by enough chromium being leached
from the wall to reach the equilibrium concen-
tration necessary for the mass transfer reactions

to take place. It is known that other mass
transfer reactions may occur when the uranium is
not present, and these may also be of secondary
importance when uranium is present. Neither
the nature nor the location of the rate-controlling
step has been determined. The diffusion of
chromium to the hot-leg surface has been shown
not to be controlling.

With present production techniques for the
fluoride mixtures, the nickel, iron, and hydrogen
fluoride impurities are reduced to levels where
they no longer play a vital part in the corrosion
mechanisms; however, if they are present in the
zirconium fluoride—base mixtures, they will
cause attack in the loop hot legs.

The most important variable controlling the
depth of corrosion is the maximum wall temper-
ature. The wall temperature is more critical
than the maximum average bulk fluoride tempera-
ture. While wall temperature is important, it must
be a relative temperature; appreciable attack is
found only at the hottest point in a loop no matter
what the actual temperatures are. Variables of
secondary importance are uranium concentration,
loop size and shape, and temperature drop.

The replacement of a portion of the UF, content
of a batch with UF, either in the production
procedure or by the addition of reducing agents,
will provide reduced depths of attack. The UF,
has only a limited solubility in zirconium fluoride—
base mixtures, so all the uranium cannot be
present in the trivalent form. These mixtures are
difficult to control during production, ond dis-
proportionation of the UF, may occur, causing the
formation of hot-leg deposits.

While Inconel is on acceptable material for
present reactors, it will not be adequate for
future larger reactors. With zirconium fluoride—
base fluoride mixtures at 1500°F, niobium, mo-
lybdenum, and Hastelloy B show promise as
future reactor materials. Some reduction in depth
of attack may be obtained in alloys similar to
Inconel but with reduced chromium concentration.
The stainless steels did not plug with these
fluoride mixtures, as they did in the case of the
alkali-metal-base fluoride mixtures, but they still
are not as good as Inconel.

The addition of UF, fo alkali-metal-base fluoride
mixtures also resulted in a reduction in depth of
attack in Inconel loops. The solubility of UF,
is higher in this system, but mixtures of UF,
and UF, were still necessary. While this mixture
shows promise for future use, production and
disproportionation problems remain to be solved,

EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
Equipment

Most of the loops used for this study were

slightly modified from those. originally  de-
veloped;! the modifications are discussed in
detail below (‘Loop Size and Shape”). The

expansion pot was replaced by a length of pipe of
the same size as that used for the loop itself.
The fill line and spark plug probe entered the
sides of this pipe through Swagelok fittings. A
typical loop is shown in Fig. 1. Most of the loops
were constructed from IPS %-in. sched-10 pipe,
but, if this was not available, IPS Yin. sched-40
pipe was used as an altemate. No changes were
made in the auxiliary equipment.

Procedure

The operating procedure remained essentially
the same as that used for the alkali-metal-fluoride

work, | except for the addition of a cleaning step,
which consisted in circulating another batch of
fluorides for 2 hr before the loop was filled with
the test mixture,

All the molten fluorides used in this study were
mixed and purified by the ANP Chemistry Section
of the Materials Chemistry Di
purification procedure included treatment with
both hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen goses at
elevated temperature followed by a prolonged
stripping operation with hydrogen and helium.
During the latter part of this study the batch size
was increased, from 50 Ib, to 250 Ib; however, for
handling and use, these batches were subdivided
into 50-lb batches. The batching down was
carried out while the mixture was molten, and the
usual steps were taken to avoid contamination.
Once a pot was filled, it was held under a positive
helium pressure at all times. Helium gas was
allowed to leak to the atmosphere whenever a
was made or broken. During the
actual transfer to a loop, helium pressures were
maintained in both the loops and the fifl pot.
The rate of transfer was controlled by adjusting
the difference between these pressures.

The liquid level in the loop was controlled by
the location of the outlet from the transfer line.
When a signal was obtained on the spark-plug
probe, which was located above this level, the
helium pressure in the loop was increased and
the excess liquid was transferred back to the fill
pot. After the loop reached operating temperature,
any excess liquid resulting from expansion was
blown back to the fill pot. A sample of the
original liquid was trapped in an enlarged section
of the transfer line for chemical analysis.

After the loop had operated for the desired
time, the power was tured off and the liquid
allowed to freeze in place. The loops were then
sectioned as shown in Fig. 2. The material was
melted out of the 2-in. sections in an inert-atmos-
phere fumace; the pipe sections were sent for
metallographic examination, and the fluorides for
chemical analysis. Sections 1A, 2A, and 4A
were stored in a dry box as reserve samples.
The ends of the other sections were covered with
tape. The loop sections were stored for three
months; then, if they had not been used, they
were sent to salvage.

to be standard conditions. These loops circu-

a hot-leg temperature of 1500°F and a tempera-

either as preliminary loops to outline the problems
to be encountered with this mixture or as control
loops for some of the early studies. These loops
were not precleaned, and close control of con-
ditions had not yet been established. The second
group were run as controls for later studies, and
all were precleaned. While some scatter in re-
sults still exists this second group, the
reproducibility, especially during the fluoride
production, was much better than was found in
the early loops. The data for the first group are
tabulated in Table 2 and those for the second
group in Table 3.

It is apparent from Table 2 that a variation in
maximum depth of attack from 5 to 18 mils was
With
many of these loops the iron and nickel impurity
concentrations of the original fluorides were also
high, but the maximum depth of attack did not
vary in a systematic manner with these concen-
trations. Another cause of variation in attack
was an undetermined amount of hydrogen fluoride
left in the fluoride mixture from the purification
process. This hydrogen fluoride would react
with the loop wall, producing iron and nickel
fluorides which in turn would reduce the chromium.
When this group of loops were operated, no suit-
able method was available for measuring the
hydrogen fluoride concentration.

When a method became available for measuring
the hydrogen fluoride content of the mixtures, it
was to be necessary to
stripping time after purification to reduce the
hydrogen fluoride to acceptable levels. The
control loops tabulated in Table 3 were those in
which the controlled fluoride batches were circu-
lated. While considerable variation is still
found in the maximum depths of attack, it is not
as great as in Table 2,

found increase the

The loops in Table 3 are tabulated approxi-
mately in the order in which they were filled or
in order of time. If this table is divided info
quarters and average maximum attacks calculated
for each quarter, it may be noted that the depths
of attack are higher at the end, that is, that the
attack is gradually increasing with time. The
average depth for the entire table was 9.1 mils,
while the attack for the four quarters averaged
7.0, 9.2, 9.6, and 10.5 mils, respectively. As a
comparison, the average in Table 2 was 10.1 mils.
The poorer control of production with the large
batches was responsible for some of the increase
but not for all of it, since the trend was a gradual
one, Neither the other causes of this gradual
increase nor the cause of the occasional very
deep attacks has been determined. The increased
purging time and closer control in the second
group have made the attack more consistent but
have not resulted in a large average reduction in
Since the average
chromium content in the fluorides after operation
of the loops in Table 2 is higher than affer
operation of those tabulated in Table 3, there
appears also to be a reduction in intensity of
attack over the entire loop with the controlled
batches.

In an effort to determine whether air contami-
nation during filling or operation could be
sponsible for the variation in attack, o series of
loops were operated with fluoride batches which
had been deliberately contaminated. Loops were
operated under three conditions: (1) with helium
pressure only during filling, (2) with no protective
atmosphere combined with a small air leak, and
(3) with a 1-liter volume of air bubbled through
the batch before transfer. The loop with no
protective atmosphere ond a slow leak developed
an attack of 21 mils in 500 hr, which was double

maximum depth of attack.

that found in the control loops. The other two
loops developed maximum depths of attack within
the usual spread. However, in loop operation
there is only a remote possibility that develop-
ment of a leak and failure of the protective gas
system would occur simultaneously.

When the gradual increase in attack became
apparent, loops 684, 685, and 686 were filled on
the same day from the same batch of fluorides.
The operators were watched and were extremely
careful to avoid any operation that could permit
contamination. The attack in 500 hr in these
loops was 11, 14, and 9 mils, respectively.
Since a variation was still found, these loops
indicated that the trouble was not from careless
operators or from the batch, Changes in the
batches could have caused the gradual increase
but not the wide and unpredictable variations.
As yet, no satisfactory explanation has been
offered for these variations.

To illustrate the distribution of attack around
the loop and to support the procedure of basing
conclusions primarily on the sample from the top

of the hot leg, loop 833 was sectioned in con-
siderable detail as shown by Fig. 4; the metallo-
graphic data from this loop are given in Table 4;
Fig. 5 shows typical photomicrographs from the
various loop sections. These data confirm the
fact that the maximum attack was found at the
top of the hot leg. Very little attack was found
in the hot horizontal leg, and a gradual increase
in depth was found in moving up the vertical hot
leg. This increase was more gradual than was
found in a similar examination of a loop in which
alkali-metal-base fluorides were circulated, but
otherwise the two loops were similar.! The
attack depth decreased rapidly above the heated
area, and this will be discussed in more detail
below (‘Effect of Temperature’). The three
samples from under the upper half of the top
heater checked each other very well.

Operating Time. — Since thermal loops have no
moving parts or mechanical seals, they are ideal
for long-time operation. The limiting feature in
such loops is the life of the heating elements,

Fig. 5. Variation in Attack Around Loop 833. Reduced 35%.
some difficulty, In this program a considerable
number of loops were operated for 1000 hr or
longer.

To determine how the maximum depth of attack
varied with operating time, several series of
tests were made with various fluoride batches.
These data are tabulated in Table 5 and plotted
in Fig. 6. As shown on the plot, considerable

spread was apparent in the data; however, if they
are separated into the various fluoride production
batches, a series of nearly parallel curves is
found. In each case a few points do not fall on
the curve; these are thought to be another ex-
ample of the unexplained occasional wide varia-
tions found in the control loops.

With all these curves, after about 300 hr the
increase in depth of attack is linear and is at a

reaching equilibrium; it was affected by such
things as impurities from any source and by the
dissolving of sufficient chromium to reach equi-
librium concentrations.

An interesting point in the tests was the average
chromium content found in the fluorides after
operation of the loop. While the depth of attack
increased with time, the chromium concentration
in the fluorides did not. The concentration was
established during the first stage of the attack
and then remained constant. In some long-time
loops, metallic chromium crystals were found in
the trap at the bottom of the cold leg. This
deposit appeared first as a ring made up from
fine dendritic crystals sticking to the trap wall
just above the liquid-solid interface found in the
trap. It continued to grow until an entire disk
was formed, as shown in Fig. 8. In many 1000-
and 2000-hr loops, no crystals at all were found,
and in none of the loops were sufficient metallic

14

trap deposits were identified as metallic chromium
by x-ray diffraction and spectrographic studies.
With the depth of attack varying with time as
shown in Fig. 6, diffusion of chromium within the
pipe wall could possibly be the rate-controlling
step. If this were true, the depth of attack would
be independent of the solutions and so should be
the same after circulating two fluoride batches
for 250 hr each as after circulating one batch for
500 hr. However, loop 281 developed a total
depth of attack of 17 mils with two batches circu-
lated for 250 hr each, while loop 280 developed
an attack of 8 mils with a single 500-hr circulation
of another portion of the same batch. Additional
evidence that the controlling step is not in the
wall is provided in loops 333 and 334, Loop 334
circulated a batch that had been previously
circulated in loop 333. An attack to 5 mils was
found after 500 hr in loop 334, while in loop 333
an attack to 14 mils was found after only 240 hr.

from Loop 344.

The attack in loop 334 was higher than would be
predicted from the curves, but the original batch
was of poor quality, and the 240 hr in loop 333
does not appear to be sufficient time for it to
reach equilibrium, When the fluoride mixture was
transferred to loop 334, 225 ppm of iron was still
present.

Other evidence that chromium diffusion is not
the limiting factor during the longer operating
times is presented below (‘‘Change in Analysis
of Inner Pipe Wall").

These tests show that while the chromium is
continually removed from the inner surface of the
pipe wall, the wall is not being continually
depleted. Chromium is removed fairly rapidly
during the early stages of rapid attack, but with
the decrease in removal rate the chromium diffuses
to the surface as fast as it is removed and
possibly even at a slightly higher rate. If the
chromium diffusion rate was the limiting factor,
the surface would be continually depleted, or at
least remain constant, instead of the concentration
evening out.

Effect of Temperature. — For all this work, the
loop operating temperature was measured from
thermocouples  spot-welded to the pipe wall
several inches above the top heater, As long as
the temperature is measured in the same manner
and at the same spot in all loops, the measure-
ments are comparable, but they may be only
relative. The development of the methods of
installing the thermocouples and the choice of
locations were discussed in the previous report,
With the techniques used on the loops several
errors are known to be present. The temperatures
were measured on the outer pipe wall surface
above the heaters. While the bulk fluoride temper-

16

ature would change little, if at all, in this dis-
tance, a difference in wall temperature would be
found. Under the heaters the driving force is
inward, and therefore the walls are hotter than
the fluoride; above the heaters, the reverse is
true. The temperature of interest is the maximum
temperature at the interface between the liquid
and the pipe wall, but for practical reasons it is
the temperature of the outer wall that is measured,
and this at only a few spots. Thus there is no
assurance that the maximum interface temperature
is being measured.

Two attempts were made to
maximum wall

determine the
temperature under the heaters.
Thermocouples were attached to the walls of
these loops by various methods, and several
different radiation shields were provided for the
thermocouple beads. In addition, several thermo-
couples were buried in the wall.
pected, a spread in temperatures was obtained,
but for both loops the maximum wall temperature
appeared to be between 150 and 175°F above the
measured standard loop operating temperature,
This temperature difference was larger than was
expected, but since so much work had already
been done with the temperature above the last
heater used as the so-called maximum, it was
decided to complete the work without making a
change in the technique. The thermal loop data
are suitable only for direct comparison to give
trends and for studies of mechanisms and are not
intended as reactor or loop design data; therefore
such a decision was reasonable.

When this started, considerable
discussion had occurred as to what temperatures
should be measured ond how. Considerable
difficulty hod been encountered with failure, by
breaking loose, of thermocouples under the
heaters; installation there was more difficult,
and such failure could easily produce high values.
For these reasons, it was decided to measure
the temperature just above the heaters. In
retrospect this appears to have been a mistake,
since wall temperature has now been shown to be
the most important variable and the error in
measuring with this method is larger than was
thought; so it would now appear desirable with
each loop to actually measure the temperature
under the heaters.

The data showing the variation in depth of
attack with variations in hot-leg temperature are
tabulated in Table 6 and summarized in Table 7.

the 1500-hr loops with mixture 44, but the shape
is typical. With other mixtures and times the
slopes of the upper curves change, but in all
cases a nose is apparent, While breaks have
also been noted in some physical properties in
this temperature range, no definite reasons have
been advanced for the increase in depth of attack.

As shown by the photomicrographs in Fig. 10,
the nature of the voids also changes with temper-

ature. At low temperatures, even with the long
times, the voids are small ond fairly evenly
distributed. As the temperature increases, the

voids grow in size and concentrate in the grain
boundaries.

Temperature in Loops Operated for 1500 hr.

While a variation in attack occurs with temper
ature, this variation is relative. It has been
shown that considerable attack can be found in a
loop whose hot leg was at 1500°F, but none is
found in the 1300°F cold leg. When the loop
temperature was increased until the cold leg was
at 1500°F, no change was found in the distribution
of the attack. This was also true when the hot-
leg temperature was dropped to 1350°F,

Additional evidence that the actual temperature
is not as important as the relative temperature
was found in the data in Table 4. As discussed

previously in this section, very little change

would be found in bulk fluoride temperature
between samples 8 and 1A; however, some differ-
ence would be found in wall temperature, The
depth of attack has been reduced by one-half in
this 1-in, distance. This rapid decrease in attack
was confirmed with loop 268. The top of the hot
leg of this loop was sectioned longitudinally, and
the attack decreased from a heavy 12 mils to a
light 4 mils in a distance of 0.75 in.

In another attempt to show the correlation
between depth of attack and heater location,
loop 456 was operated with an unheated, but
well-insulated, area near the top of the hot leg.
The maximum depth of attack in the unheated
area was 3 mils, while attacks to 9 mils were
found in the heated areas on both ends of this
zone. The change in depth was quite rapid at
both ends. The effects of the unheated area must
be complex, since the 9-mil attack below the gap
was deeper than would be found in a comparable
area in a control loop. It is possible that the
gap in the heaters had an effect upon the forced
convection currents found by Hamilton. These
currents could affect both the laminar layer and
the wall temperature.

also shown
Loop 259 was part of the
temperature study and had an Inconel thermocouple
well suspended in the middle of the hot leg.
Fluoride 27 was circulated in this loop, and
after 500 hr a typical attack to 8 mils was found
on the loop wall. In a section directly opposite
this area, the thermocouple well showed only a
light attack to a maximum depth of 1 mil. The
distance between the thermocouple well and the
loop wall was only 0.2 in., but all the attack had
been concentrated on the hotter surface.

All these tests illustrate the fact that the
maximum wall temperature is a more critical
variable than average bulk fluoride temperature
is. When a temperature difference is present
between two surfaces, the attack will be concen-
trated on the hotter surface, even if the colder

temperature difference between the two legs is
also a change in flow driving force, and so must
be reflected as a change in velocity. With a
standard loop design and heater location, any
change in temperature drop requires a change in
heat input and therefore a change in maximum
wall temperature, Since in a thermal loop the
Reynolds number is already very low, it was
speculated that the changes in flow would not
have a big effect on the laminar layer and there-
fore that changes in temperature drop could be
studied, ot least in an approximate manner. It
has now been shown in the pump loops that
velocity is not a critical variable, The varia-
tions in wall temperature would, however, still
cause errors,

For this series of tests the temperature drops
in the loops were varied by placing various
amounts of insulation on the cold leg. An attempt
was made fo increase the drop by air-cooling the
cold leg, but with the standard loop design,
sufficient heating was not available to maintain
the hot-leg temperature at 1500°F. The long-time
loops in this series were terminated by a building
power failure after they had been circulated for
varying periods. For comparative purposes, small
corrections were made in the depths of attack fo
compensate for the variations in time. In all
cases the corrections, and therefore any errors,
were smaller than the normal spread in results.

As shown by the data tabulated in Table 8 and
summarized in Table 9, a decrease in depth of
attack was found with smaller temperature drops.
This was found with both the short- and the long-
time loops. While these data seem to show an
effect, they cannot be considered as proof, since
with the lower temperature drops, lower wall
temperature would be found. This would also
reduce the attack, and the two variables cannot
be separated from these data, It was shown
previously that while wall temperature was critical
it was relative in that a temperature drop was
also necessary. This would be indirect confir-
mation that increased temperature drop will cause
increased attack.

A conflict is apparent in the data in Table 9.
An increase in attack was found for each time
series with an increase in temperature drop;
however, the increases were independent of time.
Thus these data indicate that the depth of attack
does not increase with time and therefore conflict
with the results presented above (“‘Operating

Time"), This conflict cannot be blamed on batch
variation, since portions of both EE batches
155 and 198 were operated for different times
with the same temperature drop and in both cases
this independence with time was noted. A series
of loops with insulated cold legs were therefore
operated for varying times. The data for this
series are also tabulated in Table 8 and do show
an increase in depth with time. The attack in the
500-hr insulated loop is only half that found in

the control loop, confirming the data reported
above. The fact that 3 mils attack was found
after only 14 hr with a low temperature drop shows
that prolonged cleaning times should be avoided.

Additives. — [n the discussion on the control
loops it was pointed out that the depth of attack
seemed to increase with the presence of iron or
nickel in the fluorides, but because of other
variables a definite correlation could not be

made. The variation of attack with iron and
nickel concentrations was also noted in the
original alkali metal work. To establish a
better correlation, several loops were therefore
operated with controlled additions of nickel
fluoride. The nickel fluoride was added to the
batch in the transfer pot in order to produce a
more uniform distribution. While the batch was
being agitated with helium, some of the nickel
fluoride reacted with the pot walls, resulting in
smaller additions than had been planned. A
Micro Metallic filter was used in the transfer line
to prevent transfer of any metallic nickel. The
data from these loops are tabulated in Table 10,
From these data, an increase in depth of attack
over that of a control loop was found in each of
the 500-hr loops to which nickel fluoride had
been added. Since the amount of nickel actually
added is not known, an exact comparison cannot
be made, but the depth of attack does increase
with increasing additions. The increases are not
as large as was expected, with an addition of
1000 ppm of nickel fluoride causing a doubling in
the depth of attack. Since some of the chromium
in these loops was picked up in the charge pot,
the fluorides were partially saturated before
being circulated. To compare these loops with
control loops the hot-leg attack would have to be
increased sufficiently to balance the chromium
picked up in the pot. With present production
techniques for the fluoride mixtures, the varia-
tions in nickel and iron found in the original
batches are not large, and from this work it does
not appear that they are the cause of the erratic
attack. Typical hot-leg sections from one of
these loops and from the 500-hr loops with the
other additions discussed below are presented in
Fig. 11. Portions of the same fluoride batch

22

were used in loops 454 and 455 to determine the
effect of nickel fluoride on the rate of mass
transfer. The longer-time loop developed an
attack of 16 mils, which is an increase of only
1 mil in 1335 hr; however, some increase was
found in the number and size of the voids. While
it is possible that nickel fluoride will not increase
the rate of mass transfer, it should react to
produce chromium fluoride, which is shown below
to increase this rate, No satisfactory explanation
has been found for this inconsistency. Typical
hot-leg sections showing the effect of this addi-
tive and others on mass transfer are shown in
Fig. 12.

Additions of both chromic and chromous fluoride
were made in a manner similar to that described
for the nickel fluoride. The data for these loops
are also tabulated in Table 10. It has been
shown by work in the Materials Chemistry Division
that when CrF, is odded to fluoride mixtures
with a zirconium fluoride base it is reduced to
CrF,, the latter being the only valence state that
has been found in such mixtures, The addition of
CrF, should reduce the attack found in the first
stage by providing some of the chromium required
to reach equilibrium. With CrF, this effect would
also be found, but it would be offset by an in-
crease in attack caused by the extra fluorine atom,

The data in Table 10 do show a reduction in
depth of attack when CrF, was added fo a loop
operated for 500 hr. However, in a loop operated
for 1710 hr the depth was slightly deeper than
was found in control loops operated for similar
times; thus, since the depth at 500 hr was re-
duced, the rate of mass transfer increased. For
these loops the data would indicate a rate of
1 mil per 100 hr rather than the 0.4 mil found
with the control loops.

After 500 hr, batches to which CrF, had been
added developed the same depth of attack found
in the control loops. It is possible that the
presence of CrF, and the accompanying free
fluorine atom canceled each other. A definite
increase in amount and depth of attack was
noted for these loops at 2000 hr; the rate during
the period from 500 to 2000 hr was 0.9 mil per
100 hr.

In both cases the addition of chromium fluoride
resulted in an increase in the rate of mass
transfer. This appears to conflict with the
statement above (see ‘Operating Time’) that the

rate of mass transfer seems to be independent of
batch purity; however, the additions made here
are much larger than would be found in normal
batch variations.

In some of the early loops, chromium metal
powder and Inconel tumings were added to the
fluorides in the charge pot. The chromium did
result in a small decrease in attack, but metallic
layers were found on the cold-leg surface. A
small improvement appears to have been obtained
from the Inconel turnings, but the results are not
definite, From the time data obtained with the

loops, it was shown that about 200 hr was re-
quired for the impurity and saturation reactions
to be completed, so it appears that fairly long
treatment times would be necessary for equi-
librium. For these batches 24 hr was the longest
treatment time used.

A group of loops was operated with graphite
present in the hot legs. The purpose of these
loops was to determine whether graphite could be
used in an Inconel-fused-salt system. With
loop 294 a Yuin. graphite rod was suspended
in the center of the upper portion of the hot leg,
while with loops 674 and 675 tubular inserts with
internal diameters the same as the diameter of
the Inconel pipe were used. The tubular inserts
were about 6 in. long and were located just below
the hottest portion of the loop. With each of
these loops a definite increase in the depth of
attack in the Inconel was noted. A deposit was
present on the surface of the graphite and pene-
trated it for a considerable depth, The photo-
micrograph in Fig. 13 shows the surface of the
insert from loop 294 and shows the deposit
extending for a depth of 17 mils. On the surface
the deposit is in the form of a thin film of metal
surrounding nonmetallic particles.

function of this material was to convert a portion

was zirconium hydride.

Ratio of Surface Area to Loop Volume. — One
difficulty in comparing
corrosion tests is the wide variation between the
tests in the surface area to volume ratios. In
isothermal static tests it is easy to define and
figure such ratios; however, with dynamic sys-
tems it is difficult to determine what the signifi-
cant parameters are, let alone measure them.
The significant surface area is the one where
the rate-controlling step takes place and could be
the cold-leg surface as well as the hot-leg
surface.

For this discussion the ratio of the heated
surface to the total loop volume was used. Since
each loop was made from a single size of pipe
and all loops are the same length, such ratios are
dependent only upon the pipe diameter. The
ratios would vary in value depending upon what
is considered as the critical surface, but such
variations would cancel out in comparing various
loops with the same length of critical surfaces
and would depend only upon differences in the
diameters,

A series of otherwise identical loops were
constructed from tubing and pipe of various
diameters. The data from these loops are tabu-
lated in Table 11. After 500 hr the loops with the
low ratios of surface area fo volume show the
most attack. This is as would be expected, since
the chromium required by the batch was obtained

from a smaller surface. With the longer-time
loops, no definite conclusion may be drawn, as
shown by the data summarized in Table 12.
After 1000 hr, less attack is found in the loops
with the low ratios than in those with high ratios;
while this is still true after 2000 hr, the differ-
ences are smaller rather than having continued to
increase, If the time from 500 to 2000 hr is con-
sidered, the differences in rate are within the
usual spread; for the loops from Y-in. tubing the
rate is about the same as those obtained from the
time curves in Fig. 6.

Oxide Removal Procedures. — While much of
the available commercial tubing contains internal
surface scale and dirt, the pipe used in this study
was supposed to have been annealed and pickled.
In most cases this specification was met, but
some loops were found in which heavy surface

Since these loops had been previously degreased
with a solvent degreaser, all loose dirt and grease
had been washed out. The layer was identified
as being primarily chromium oxide. Several
procedures were tried in an effort fo remove these
oxide layers before the loops were filled and
operated.

The loops designated ‘‘First Ser.es'’ in Table 13
were operated in connection with the original
cleaning or oxide removal study made shortly
after this work had started. As shown by the
data, no large differences in depth of attack
were found with any of the methods studied.
Although none of these loops showed a reduction
in attack from the usual control loops, a cleaning
step was still thought to be desirable to elimi-
nate erratic results caused by the occasional
heavily contaminated loops. The surest and
simplest method of oxide removal appeared fo be
the prior circulation for short times of another
batch of fluorides. This method was then adopted
as standard procedure.

When the gradual increase and poor reproduci-
bility in the depths of attack were noted, cleaning
variables were one of the suspected causes and
were checked again. The results obtained in this
second study are reported as ‘Second Series” in
Table 13. Since cleaning variables represent
attack due primarily to the reduction of impuri-
ties, they should show up more in short-time
loops; therefore the loops in this series were
operated for only 250 hr. These loops again show
no apparent variation in depth of attack with the
various oxide removal steps. Some variations are

clusion were to be drawn, it would have to be
that the lowest attack was in the loops that
received only a careful degrease and visual
check with no oxide removal operation.

Heating Methods. — Both to reduce the number
of variables and for ease in operation, it was
desirable to use only a single heating method.
From previous work it was known that clamshell
resistance-wound heaters and saturable-core
reactors for control were a satisfactory combi-
nation. Consequently, these heaters were adopted
for this study, but, since it was shown previously
that the attack was heavier and deeper under the
heaters, a study of the effect of heat flux on
was desirable. In addition,
corrosion theories were proposed in which the
heating method was a variable.
questions it was necessary to operate some loops
with a different method of heating.

A method of heating by means of the electrical
resistance of the pipe wall was used during the
cleaning operation and was then modified for
use during operation. To concentrate the heating
in the hot leg, so that the heating area and dis-
tribution would one electric
terminal was connected to the middle of the hot
leg and the other one connected in parallel to
both ends of this leg. Because of the short path,
the resistance was low and very high currents
were required to give the required power. The
data from the loops heated in this manner are
tabulated in Table 14, and a typical hot-leg
section is shown in Fig. 14. The depths of

loops.

Some effort was spent by the Experimental
Engineering Section in developing a gas-fired
furnace capable of heating the loops. This
method would be especially advantageous for
higher temperature loops, since at 1500°F the
heating capacity of the electrical equipment is
being approached. As yet, a gas furnace has not
been built in which the maximum wall temperature

30

and the maximum fluoride temperature occur in
the same vicinity and in which no hot spots are
present. While direct comparisons cannot be
made at this time, no larger differences in attack
have been found with the preliminary gas-heated
loops.

While it has been shown that deeper attack may
be found under a heater, the attack does not
depend upon the method of heating. The differ-
ences are caused by the higher temperatures,
either in the wall or, more likely, in the fluid
boundary layer adjacent to the walls.

When a reactor system is compared with a
thermal loop, two differences in heating are
found. In the reactor the heat is generated within
the liquid, and so the wall is at a slightly lower
temperature than the liquid.
ture cycling may be present and may be quite
rapid. As yet, no method has been devised by
which a loop may be internally heated, so that
the first difference will have to be checked in
the radiation tests. A series of tests were set
up to determine whether the second difference —
temperature cycling — increased the rate of mass
transfer,

In addition, tempera-

The temperature cycle used for these loops was
periodic and, to avoid excessive wall temper-
atures, of fairly long duration. Figure 15 shows
the hot-leg temperature pattern of a typical loop.
The corrosion data for this series are tabulated
in Table 15. Within the accuracy of the data
this slow cycling did not affect the depth of
corrosion. It appears that the cycling averages
the attack over the entire temperature range rather
than effectively increasing the differences, and
it has already been shown that the depth of
attack is not affected greatly by changes in hot-
leg temperatures. It is possible that a more
rapid cycling could increase the attack by
effectively increasing the temperature drop, but
this cannot be confirmed in the present equipment.

studies progressed, some effort was made to
improve the design of the loops.

A major simplification in fabrication was the
elimination of the expansion pot, which required
several different sizes of material
siderable welding. This pot was originally
provided on the loops to take care of expansion
of the liquid and to allow more leeway in filling.
With experience in loop handling, it was found
possible fo fill to between rather narrow limits;
consequently, the pots were replaced by a straight
length of pipe of the same size as the loop, which
was welded into the top of the loop. The gas
and vacuum connections as well as the fill line
and spark-plug probe were connected into the
side of this pipe by means of Swagelok fittings
as shown in Fig. 1.

In making some calculations on loop design,
J. F. Bailey showed that a major portion of the
flow resistance was in the sharp bends where the
legs joined. The loop was therefore redesigned
with smooth curves at both these positions. The
riser leg and trap were saddle-welded on the high
and low points of the loop. In making this change,
it was necessary to relocate the thermocouples;
so it was not definitely established whether an
increase in velocity was obtained. No measur-
able change in depth of attack was found in the
control loops of this design compared with those
with the sharp joints.

When work was started with liquid metals it
was noted that the deposits of metallic crystals
found in loops with the trap in line with the cold
leg were larger than those in loops with a smooth
bend and the trap offset several inches. In both
cases the temperature pattern in the trap would
be the same, but it is speculated that with the
sharp bend the crystals could settle out, while
with an offset trap they were easily carried
across the small opening. This does not neces-
sarily mean that more crystals were formed, only
that they were concentrated and easier fo find.
Since it was desirable to use a standard loop for
all work, the in-line trap and sharp bend for the
lower joint were made standard, This change
caused an increase in temperature drop of about
10°F, showing that some decrease in velocity
had taken place. The configuration of the stand-
ard loop after incorporating these changes, shown
in Fig. 1, is satisfactory for normal loop materials
and coolants but is objectionable for special
materials in that it requires considerable amounts

and con-

32

 

of materials both for the loops and for filling
them. Such materials as niobium and molybdenum
not only are expensive in the required quantities
but are hard to obtain in the required lengths.

A series of loops were fabricated with various
ratios of height to width. Unfortunately, as with
so many other variables in the loops, any variation
in size affects other variables, such as tempera-
ture drop, so that only the over-all effect can be
observed. With the change in temperature drop,
it is likely that a change in wall temperature was
also occurring. The corrosion data for this
series of loops are tabulated in Table 16 and
indicate that it is possible to reduce the loop
size by one-half with only a small reduction in
depth of attack,

Change in Analysis of Inner Pipe Wall. — As
shown by all the photomicrographs in this report,
visually the attack found after circulating zir-
conium fluoride—base fluorides appears to be the
same as that reported for alkali-metal-base
mixtures.! Thin layers were removed from the
inner surfaces of both the hot and cold legs to
determine whether the changes were also similar
chemically, Obtaining thin, uniform layers with
enough material for analyses is a difficult pro-
cedure. After operation at 1500°F the pipes are
no longer perfectly round, and in addition, lengths
of at least 6 in. are required to get enough sample
with 5-mil layers being removed; both these
facts make it difficult for the machinist to main-
tain the required depth during the drilling. For
this reason the depths reported in the work must
be considered as being only relative.

The analyses of the various layers removed
from the hot legs of three 500-hr loops are given
in Table 17. The samples were cut as concentric
layers, and the deepest cut in each sample is
listed in the ‘depth The tabulated
analyses give the average concentration between
the depth listed for the line in which it is tabu-
lated and the depth listed for the line directly
above. These analyses show that the mechanism
has not changed and that chromium is still the
major constituent removed from the wall by the
attack, The chromium is removed from a depth
greater than that of the microscopic voids, con
firming the obvious assumption that a certain
contentration of vacancies is necessary for the
appearance of voids, As shown by Fig. 16, the
change of chromium concentration with depth
is a straight line on a logarithmic plot. Any

change in iron or nickel is difficult to determine,
and if it occurs must be small. With two of the
loops the Fe/Ni ratio decreased slightly, while
with the third no change was noted.

With these same samples, an attempt was made
fo determine whether any components of the
fluoride mixture were present below the surface,
although satisfactory analyses were not possible
because sufficient sample did not remain after

zirconium, uranium, and fluoride ions were re-
ported as being present in all samples and in
decreasing with depth; however, the
ratio of their concentrations varied from sample
to sample and in all cases was different from that
in the original mixture. In no case were the
amounts reported sufficient to account for the
volume of holes seen under the microscope.
This work does not prove that the fluoride mixture
is not present below the surface; however, it
indicates that fluorides are not present in
sufficient quantities to have filled all the voids.

Analyses from similar chemical samples re-
moved from loop 765 after it had circulated for
2000 hr are shown in Table 18. These values do
not show any significant decrease compared with
those obtained from the 500-hr loops. This would
indicate that chromium is replaced in the surface
layers by diffusion as fast as it is removed by
mass transfer.

Additional evidence that the chromium concen-
tration of the surface does not continue to de-
crease with operating time is shown in Fig. 17.

When chromium is removed from Inconel, a mag-
netic alloy results when the chromium concen-
tration is reduced below a value which lies be-
tween 8 and 10% chromium. The magnetic areas
in the samples shown in Fig. 17 are outlined by
the use of an electromagnet and a fine colloidal

suspension of iron on the sample. The thickness
of the magnetic layer gradually increases for the
first 100 hr, then after about 350 hr, during which
time it remains about the same, it starts to
After 500 hr, only scattered spots are
present and they gradually disappear with longer
times until at 3000 and 5000 hr no traces of
magnetism were found. These tests show that the
minimum chromium concentration in the wall
occurred between 100 and 350 hr, which is the
same time at which the break occurs in the time
curve, and that with the longer times the chromium
diffused to the surface faster than it was removed.

Chemical analyses were also made of layers
from the cold legs of several loops, but no varia-
tions large enough to show with these techniques
were found. If chromium is depositing on the
surface, it is either present as an extremely
thin layer or is diffusing inward rapidly.

Effect of Uranium Concentration. — The uranium
concentrations used in this study were based
upon nuclear requirements and were periodically
revised as reactor design was developed. It
became obvious that to study corrosion funda-
mentals it would be necessary to adopt one
composition as the standard and check the others
only sufficiently to determine that the data could
be extrapolated. Fluoride mixture 30 was the one
under consideration at the time and so was
adopted as the standard. A mixture close to
No. 44 was used for the Aircraft Reactor Experi-
ment and received some study. During the pre-
liminary testing of reactor systems, it will be
necessary to operate for considerable periods of
times with mixtures that do not contain uranium,
and during the enriching operation
having a range of uranium concentrations will be

mixtures

used.
To provide data on the effect of uranium concen-
tration upon depth of attack several series of

loops were operated, Since in the fluoride pro-
duction a considerable portion of the impurities
are added with the uranium, it was difficult to
make comparable batches which differ only in
amounts of uranium. From data presented above
(“‘Additives’’), it appears that slight variations
in impurity are not as critical as was feared and
that comparisons of these data should be
permissible,

Data from loops operated for both 500 and
2000 hr with batches containing various uranium
concentrations are presented in Table 19. The
changes in depth of attack after 500 hr with
variations in uranium concentration are plotted in
Fig. 18. These data indicate that an increase in
depth of attack was found with increasing uranium
content. This increase was at a rate of about
0.5 mil for each per cent of uranium added. A
more rapid increase is possible with low addi-
tions, but these batches were of a higher purity,
and so the results need confirming. On the same

figure the average depths obtained with the
control batches of fluorides 30, 31, and 44 are
shown. For these averages a straight line was
found with ao rate only slightly lower than the
other one, Considerable variation was found in
the depths of attack after 2000 hr, and no definite
conclusions may be drawn. Additional loops will
be necessary to show the effect of uranium concen-
tration on depth of attack resulting strictly from
mass transfer.

Two loops were operated with batches con-
taining high uranium concentrations, and the data
from these loops, also tabulated in Table 19, do
not lie on the curves shown in Fig, 18. In both
cases, the depth of attack was less than would
be predicted, Another difference in these two
loops was that the chromium concentration did
not build up to the usual levels. A comparison
with the data presented below (‘‘Special Fuel
Mixtures’) points out the possibility that a
portion of the high UF, concentration has dis-
proportionated into UF;. The UF; would lower
the equilibrium chromium concentration and
reduce the depth of attack.

Barren Fluoride Mixtures

During the cleaning and preliminary testing
stages of reactor operation, the material circu-
lated is similar to that used during operation,
except for the absence of uranium. The operating
time during such operations can be a considerable
fraction of the total operating time, and therefore
corrosion during this period must also be studied.

An examination of the data tabulated in Table 20
reveals that the corrosion mechanism is not the
same when the uranium is present as when it is

not. The average depth of attack in the standard
loops after 500 hr was 57 mils or about two-
thirds of the depth in similar loops containing
UF, mixtures. The appearance of the attack, as
shown in Fig. 19, is similar to that previously
discussed. The iron and nickel in the fluorides
after operation decreased in the usual manner,
but the chromium concentration is lower.

An increase in depth of attack was found with
increases in operating time. While the values
vary with the different fluoride batches, an
average rate of increase, as shown by Fig. 20,
would be about 2 mils per 1000 hr, or about half
that with the UF, addition. The voids also grow
in size with increasing operating times, as shown
in Fig. 19. The increase in depth of attack or
mass transfer takes place in this mixture with
very low chromium concentrations. In the cold
legs of both the 2000- and 3000-hr loops, operated
with a portion of the high-purity materials used in
the ARE, dendritic crystals of chromium metal
were found.

Another difference with the barren mixtures
was revealed by loops 337 and 338, Both these
loops circulated for 500 hr, but loop 337 operated
with two batches of high-purity ARE fluorides,
and the first batch drained from 337 was then
circulated for on additional 500 hr in 338, The
depth of attack with both these loops was about
the same as in the control loops, rather than
being double and half, respectively. Hot-leg
sections from these loops are shown in Fig. 21.
These data indicate that this attack is caused
primarily by mass transfer, with impurities and
saturation playing only a minor part.

The actual mass transfer mechanism with the
barren solutions is not known, since insufficient
work has been done on concentrations and
equilibrium constants in systems which do not
contain uranium. The most likely reactions
would result in a change in solubility with temper-
ature, for example, 3CrF, == 2CrF; + Cr or
possibly 2Na + CrF, ==Cr + 2NaF. Reactions
with zirconium are also a possibility, but no
evidence for them has been found.

material selection was made were carried out

general, these tests are much more favorable than
the previous ones were.

Stainless Steels. — All stainless steel loops
operated satisfactorily for 500 hr when zirconium
fluoride—base mixtures were circulated in them,
as shown by the data tabulated in Table 21. The
hot-leg attack in type 316 stainless steel loops
was similar in appearance (Fig. 22) and to about
the same depth as was found in Inconel loops.
As would be expected from solubility studies,
the iron and nickel concentrations of the fluorides
remained low and the chromium increased during
The disadvantage of this alloy is the
metallic deposits that were always found in the
cold legs (Fig. 22). Attempts to identify the
deposit by spectrographic and diffraction studies
were not successful, but indications are that iron
and chromium are both present.

When the loops were fabricated from a 400
series stainless steel, the nature of the attack
changed. The hot-leg surfaces were rough, with
entire crystals being removed, and no subsurface
voids were present. Large deposits of dendritic
metallic crystals were found in the cold legs.
Typical cold-leg sections with types 410 and
446 stainless steel are shown in Fig. 23. The
cold-leg deposit in a type 410 loop analyzed
53.4% Fe-4.3% Cr-1% Ni-12.9% Zr. In a type
446 loop the crystals were 35.7% Fe-7.6% Cr-1%
Ni-13.8% Zr. The zirconium is not part of the
crystals but is from unseparated fluorides. These
data indicate that both iron and chromium can be

mass-transferred in these systems, and while the
loops operated without plugging for 500 hr, the
rate of mass transfer is much too high for use of
these alloys.

Izett Iron. — The single instance of a loop
plugging with zirconium fluoride—base mixtures
was found with Izett iron (low-carbon high-purity
iron) loop No. 47. This loop plugged in 39 hr by
the formation of balls of dendritic metal crystals
(Fig. 24). The hot-leg attack was an even re-
moval, but the depth could not be determined,
since considerable oxidation of the outer surface
also occurred.

Nickel. = Two “A” nickel loops operated for
500 hr with very little hot-leg attack. The wall
surfaces were polished, but the thicknesses were
still within commercial tolerance, so at least no
large amount of metal was removed. Neither
intergranular nor void type of attack was found,
as shown in Fig. 25. A few metallic crystals
were found in the cold leg of loop 108, but none
were found in loop 110. In both loops, the nickel
content of the fluorides remained very low.

Inconel X. — Attacks of 22 and 19 mils were
found after circulating fluoride 44 for 1000 hr in
loops constructed from Inconel X (15% Cr, 9% Fe,

Difficulty was encountered with the analytical
determination of molybdenum in fluorides, but it
is obvious that the solubility is very low. These
loops were not operated with in-line traps, so a
final judgment on mass transfer should be re-
served until this has been done.

studies,’ two such loops failed in short times by
catastrophic oxidation. The first two loops in
this series failed in a similar manner, but the
difficulty was remedied by replacing the Sauer-
eisen cement normally used to protect thermo-
couples with metallic shields.

In the original screening

Hastelloy B is another material showing promise
for use with the fluorides, as shown by the data
in Table 23. A few voids and cracks to shallow
depths were found in both legs, with the cracks
also being found in the as-received pipe. Very
little, if any, increase in attack was found with
an increase in hot-leg temperature from 1500 to
1650°F or with an increase in operating time to
2000 hr (Fig. 29). While the rate of attack was
low, some occurred, since in several loops a few
dendritic crystals of nickel were found in the
cold legs.

When Hastelloy B is fabricated, some mo-
lybdenum is vaporized; therefore there was a
possibility that a nickel-enriched layer on the
surface was causing the mass transfer. The
internal surfaces of several loops were machined
to eliminate any such layer. The attack found in
these loops was essentially the same as in the
normal loops.

46

The major disadvantage with Hastelloy B is
the large amount of mass transfer found when
molten sodium or sodium-potassium alloy is
circulated in it. With the presently proposed
reactors, it would be highly desirable for a metal
to have corrosion resistance to both fluorides and
alkali metals.

Special Alloys. — It has been shown that the
only metal leached from Inconel was the chromium;
therefore, in an effort fo reduce the attack, alloys
were made with decreasing chromium concen-
trations, These alloys were vacuum-melted and
extruded by the ORNL Metallurgy Division and
then drawn into Yin. tubing by the Superior Tube
Company. Fluoride corrosion data from these
loops are tabulated in Table 24, and representa-
tive hot-leg sections are shown in Fig. 30.

In each case when the chromium in these alloys
was reduced from the original 15% to about 5%,
the depth of attack was reduced by a factor of
3, The reduction was found when the chromium
was replaced with either iron or molybdenum.
When the chromium concentration was reduced fo
10%, erratic results were found.

Results from another series of special loops
are tabulated in the lower portion of Table 24,
These loops were operated to determine whether
variations in carbon content had an effect on
corrosion. Loops 366 and 367 were fabricated
from vacuum-cast metal and contained only 0.01%
carbon, The attack in both these loops was
essentially the same as that found in control
loop 359 made from commercial alloy containing

0.07% carbon (Fig. 31).

 

 

Special Fuel Mixtures

In the last report,’ it was pointed out on the
basis of only a few tests that the addition of
zirconium hydride to alkali-metal-base mixtures
showed promise of reduced depths of attack, but
that unidentified layers had been found on the
hot-leg surfaces. This type of work has con-
tinued, with similar additions being made to
zirconium fluoride—base mixtures. A large in-
vestigation into the basic mechanisms in such a
system has also been carried out by the ANP
Chemistry Section.

In two series of tests, various amounts of
zirconium hydride were added to portions of the
same large batch of fluoride 30. The zirconium
hydride was added to the fluorides in small

loops through grade G Micro Metallic filters. The
metallographic data from these loops are tabu-
lated in Table 25, with the chemical data in
Table 26. These data show that a gradual re-
duction in depth of attack was found as the
zirconium hydride concentration was increased to
about 0.7%. With larger hydride additions, layers
of increasing thickness were found on the surfaces
of the hot and cold legs, as shown in Fig. 32.
The deposits attained greater thickness in the
hot legs. With the use of a special microspark
spectrographic method, it was found that the

affected by the zirconium hydride additions.
As the hydride was increased above 0.5%, notice-
able amounts of uranium were reduced in the
charge pots and left on the filters during transfer.
With a 2% hydride addition, half the uranium was
lost. With the higher additions, small amounts of
uranium were also lost during operation of the

While the rate of
mass transfer is the same, the chromium concen-
trations of the fluorides are much less with the
additions. This low value did not increase in the
1000 hr of operation even with the mass transfer,

While zirconium hydride will reduce the depth
of attack, it does not reduce the rate of mass
transfer. Unless
trolled very closely, uranium will be lost from the
system both before and during operation. If such
a system were to be used, the deposits in both
legs would have to be studied in detail.

After it was found that the formation of UF
was responsible for the reduction of attack with
zirconium hydride additions, work was started
on batches with a portion of the uranium present

UF, and in developing a suitable method of
analyzing such mixtures.

The hot-leg attack was replaced by thin de-
posits in the first three loops, which circulated
batches made under carefully controlled con-
ditions in the laboratory (Table 27). Two of
these loops operated for 500 hr and the other for
2000. These loops all operated with low total
uranium concentrations and therefore high UF,
to UF, ratios. The hot-leg layer in the 2000-hr
loop was identified as zirconium by the micro-
spark spectrographic procedure, To show the
layers were formed during operation and not
during cooling, a loop was drained after 500 hr
of operation and while still at temperature. This
loop also showed no attack and the presence of a
zirconium layer.

The solubility of UF in the zirconium fluoride—
base mixtures is not sufficient to provide the
concentration necessary for reactor operation;
therefore it would be necessary to use mixtures

varying times with mixtures containing various
proportions of UF; to UF, and produced erratic
results, The attack was reduced, but not elimi-
nated, and the results were not consistent. Cold-
leg deposits were found in almost all of these
loops. The attack in the 2000-hr loop is much
lower than would be found in an all-UF, loop,
but drawing any conclusion conceming mass
transfer from these data would be dangerous. An
actual reduction in mass transfer rate would,
however, be partially confirmed by loop 457,
which operated with an all-UF ; mixture.

The loops (627-690 in Table 27) operated with
batches made in the production facility, and
very little, if any, reduction in attack was found
in these loops. Analyses of these batches have
shown them to contain much less UF, than had
been predicted. With both these loops and those
discussed above, the attack in most cases does
large in the chromium
concentration of the fluorides. Even small ad-
ditions of UF, must markedly lower the chromium
solubility level. The attack must be predomi-
nantly from mass transfer.

No additional loops are being operated at this
time with zirconium fluoride—base mixtures con-
taining UF,. What is causing the production
difficulties and why it has not been possible fo
obtain corrosion results comparable with those
obtained with the hydride addition, has not been
explained, Both the production ond the dis-

Alkali-Metal-Base Mixtures Containing

While the solubility of UF, in zirconium
fluoride—base mixtures is limited, it is much
higher in fluoride mixtures with an alkali-metal
base. Such mixtures are also to be preferred
from a physical property viewpoint, and so some
work was done on the mechanism and rate of
corrosion of Inconel by alkali-metal-base mixtures
containing trivalent uranium.

Again, difficulty was encountered in obtaining
reproducibility in the results and also with the
analytical procedures. In the first series of
supposedly identical loops, Nos. 499 to 528

(see Table 28), essentially no attack was found
in two loops, while it was deep and heavy in the
others, The reported UF, values are well below
the predicted values, but do not vary in a system
atic manner with the attack.

After the production techniques had been im-
proved, the remaining loops in Table 28 were
operated and gave more consistent results. The
maximum attack in these loops was to 2 mils and
was from a batch with a low UF, proportion.
Hot-leg deposits to 1 mil in thickness were found
in the loops with the slightly higher UF, concen-
trations. Typical hot-leg sections from these
loops are shown in Figs. 33 and 34. Definite
identification of the layer has not been made, but
metallographically it appears to be uranium, No
hot-leg attack was found in any loops with a
layer, Shallow attacks with no visible hot-leg
deposits were found in the loops with U***
concentrations of about 2% Cold-leg deposits,
which in one case were identified as chromium,
these loops. Thus mass
transfer is not eliminated by U*** additions.

In the second group of loops, there
tendency for large decreases in total uranium to
accompany the high UF, concentrations, but
exceptions may be noted. The variations are
larger than would be found with a mixture with
all the uranium present as UF. With the batches
having high concentrations of UF, the chromium
content of the fluorides was low; however, with
low UF, concentrations high and erratic chromium
values were found. The higher chromium levels
were found in the cold legs. These mixtures
also differed from the zirconium-base mixtures
in that the nickel content of the fluorides after
operation was higher,

From these data, it would appear that a thermal
loop may be operated without a hot-leg deposit
and with only shallow depths of attack if the
U*** content could be controlled at a concen-
tration just above 2% To operate in this range
will require closer production
control than is now available. In such a system,
additional study is necessary on dispropor-
tionation during long operating times and also on
the cold-leg deposits. The attractiveness of this
system would make such further studies appear to
be worth while if production problems can be
overcome,

REACTIONS AND MECHANISMS 3. Since nothing diffuses inward to replace the
chromium, vacancies occur in the area below
the surface.

4. The vaconcies collect in areas of discon-
tinuity and weakness, such as the grain
boundaries, and form the voids.

5. The voids concentrate and grow in size with

manner, and the same mechanism of hole formation
is thought to apply. The fact that the holes grew
and concentrate with time is additional evidence
that they are voids. |f they contained fluorides
they would have to connect to the surface and
have appreciable size; it does not appear possible
for the fluorides to move through the metal and
collect at a few larger sites; vacancies can move
but not fluorides.

The study of the chemical reactions by which
the chromium is removed from the hot-leg surface
is still the object of a large effort by the ANP
Chemistry Section. This Section studied the data
from the thermal loops and also worked with
laboratory experiments, A detailed and complete
report on these reactions will be the responsibility
of that Section. In this report, these reactions
will be discussed only briefly and where they
are indicated by the loop data. Some of the
reactions discussed here were worked out in the
chemical experiments.

With the relatively impure alkali-metal-base
mixtures previously reported,’ a large portion of
the attack found in the 500-hr tests was caused
by the impurities. Analyses of the batches used
for the loops described in this report, combined
with the corrosion data when known additions
were made, show that this is no longer true; only
a small part of the attack may now be attributed
to the known impurities.

In spite of the purity of the fluorides, the
attack is still rapid at first and then continues
at a slower rate. The chromium in solution also
increases rapidly at first but then remains
constant with increasing operating times, The
second stage of the process, in which the attack
continues but the chromium concentration in the
fluorides remains constant, is the mass transfer
phase of the attack. The first, rapid stage is
caused by the system reaching equilibrium. Any
reactions from impurities and the dissolving of
enough chromium to reach equilibrium concen-
trations are thought to be the major contributors.
The unexplained variations in depth of attack in
a period of 500 hr point to additional, as yet
reactions also occurring during this

 

unknown,
period.
The main reaction contributing to the mass
transfer is

UF, + CrF, —=2UF, + Cr

The equilibrium concentrations for this reaction

are of the proper order and direction to cause
mass transfer fo occur. No evidence of a similar
mass transfer reaction in fluoride mixtures with
zirconium and uranium has been found. The
equilibrium concentration of CrF; in these mix-
tures is too low to be determined analytically;
therefore mass transfer reactions involving this
compound must be of very minor importance.

With the reaction shown above, the rate-con-
trolling step in the process has not been de-
termined, That it is not the diffusion of chro-
miuvm through the wall to the loop surface is
shown by fhe magnetic etching studies. The
chromium gradient is steeper during the initial
stages than it is during the mass transfer stages.
After the rapid attack, the chromium diffuses to
the surface faster than it is removed and thereby
evens out the gradient somewhat. This would not
be the case if the diffusion step was the rate.
controlling step. The fact that the depth of
attack was doubled when two batches were circu-
lated in the same loop for 250 hr each is evidence
that the chromium diffusion rate is not controlling
For mass
transfer fo continue, the chromium must diffuse
into the cold-leg wall. The suggestion has been
made that this step controlling; however, no
evidence of any chromium-rich layer on the cold-
leg surfaces has been found in any long-time
loops. Any chromium metal had always been
found in the cold-leg trap, where it is essentially
removed from the system. Tracer tests are now
in progress fo provide a better answer to this
question.

The mass transfer reactions with the barren
mixtures are not as well understood. They are
the same type of reactions, since the hot:leg
attack is similar but not as heavy, and chromium
metal hos also been found in the cold-leg traps
of these loops. The most likely reactions are

CrF, + 2Na == 2NaF + Cr

even during the rapid initial attack.

 
 

or
3CrF, =—2CrF, + Cr

In either case, it would be an equilibrium

reaction.

The addition of UF, to these mixtures com-
pletely changes their reducing power and equis
librium concentrations. The chromium is not
taken into solution as rapidly, and smaller
amounts are left in the cold leg on each cycle.
