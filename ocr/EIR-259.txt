A high flux molten salt (plutonium chlorides) fast reactor

(7 GWth) with internal thermal zone for transmutation of Sr=90

and Cs-137 1s here discussed. These fission products have been
produced by breeder reactors with total power of 23 GWth and by the
the 7 GWth fast burner reactor,

For the case when the power breeder reactors achieve a breeding
gain G >0.2 the doubling time for whole system, including the

high-flux burner reactor, equals ~30 years,

The transmutation of Sr-90 and Cs-13%7 in a total flux of

3,8+1010n em Cs, and thermal flux ~2,0-10%0

n cm “s 1 can
achieve the steady-state which corresponds to an effective
half-life of 1,8 year for Sr-90 and of 8,9 years for Cs-137.
In terms of hazard coefficient the transmutation system gives

an improvement of 14 times.

The impact of numerous parameters is discussed, e.g., chemical
form of both nuclides, nature of moderator in thermal zone,
moderator, layer, fuel composition, radius of thermal zone,
ratio of burner/breeder reactors etc. The effects of replacing
chlorides with fluorides as fuel for fast core is also dis-

cussed,
1. Introduction

The aim of this work was to study the concept of transmuting
Sr-90 and Cs-137 in a very high-flux reactor. These two
isotopes are of particular interest because of their high
yield in fission, their longevity and their biological hazard.

The rather high yields (Y: mol %) from fission are

 

 

U-233 U-235 Pu-239
Sr-90 ~6,2 “5,1 2,2
Cs=137 6,6 ~6,0 ~6,7

Assuming each of the above fissile fuels to be equally prevalent
in the future, the mean yield is 4.1% for Sr-90 and 6,4% for
Cs=137.

The half-lives (28 years for Sr-90 and 30 years for Cs-137)
indicate the longevity of the isotopes. To "significantly" reduce
thelr activity (by a factor of 1000) through natural decay would
take 300 years.

The bilological hazard 1s reflected in the maximum permissible
concentrations (IAEA, 1973):

Nuclide in air, on water
(uCi/em”) (uCi/em?)

Sr-90 1.1077 1.1072

Cs=137 6.1070 yoo"

This indicates that Sr-90 is roughly 50 times more hazardous than

Cs-137 and warrants prime attention.
These facts have understandably prompted numerous transmutaticn
studies (Schneider 1974; see also Taube, 1975). The most opti-
mistic has been transmutation in a controlled thermonuclear
reactor CTR (Wolkenhauer, 1973). However, even unrealistic flux
levels in CTR could only reduce the transmutation half-life
from 30 years down to 5=-1% years. The time required for
"significant" reduction is five to ten times longer than indi-
cated above. That would be longer than the usual life of a power
plant. Furthermore, Lidsky (1975) has pointed out that for any
reasonable ratio of fusion burners to fission reactors, the
burners soon contain a much higher radioactive burden than the
fission reactors themselves. This is certainly undesirable, and
probably intolerable. A motivation for alternate solutions

remains.

This work examines the basic requirements to obtain a system cf
reactors which provide adequate breeding and self-destruction of
fission products. These requirements lead towards the inclusion
in the system of a molten salt burner reactor with a central
flux-trap (Taube 1974).
2. Formulation of Reactor Requirements

 

2.1 Minimal System Doubling Time Requirements

It was assumed at the outset that a very-high flux reactor for
fisslon product transmutation would be special, only one being
built for every L (breeder) power reactors. Such a system of
L+l reactors should provide a doubling time T <30 years;
this is estimated to satisfy the needs of future world power

development,

Doubling time is defined by

2.2 Need for Central Flux Trap

 

To accomplish a significant fission product transmutation rate
will require high neutron absorption rates. For both Sr-90 and
Cs-137, the thermal absorption cross section (in barn) is one

or two orders of magnitude greater than in the fast neutron

 

 

region:
FP 0(.0253 eV),b o(fast reactor),b 0(.0253 eV)/ofast
Sr=90 ¢.8 0.0076 ~100
Cs-137 0.11 0.0137 ~ 8

Consequently, the transmutation might be best accomplished in a
central thermal flux trap surrounded by a fast fuel region (for
high flux levels), If o(total spectrum, flux trap) =

1/2 + o(E = ,0253% eV) the estimated total flux o ot just to

 

match (K=2) the natural decay rates is ‘
for Cs=-137:

0.11
for Sr-90:
o = te * 2 = 2.0101 em st (170 = 7.88.10 19%)

 
2.3 Determination of Flux-Trap Size from Destruction-Production

Balance Requirement

 

Another important requirement will be that the FP transmutation
rate in the burner flux-trap (FT) exceed the production rate in

the power and burner fuels:

(Any additional transmutation beyond this would help to remove FP
inventory from reactors outside this system. However, for trans-
mutation to be a significant improvement over tne 1000-fold
decrease in 300 years by natural beta decay, it should then be
accomplished in a much shorter time. A reasonable goal is 30 years

(K=10), the lifetime of a power plant.)

3.1 Burner Reactor Calculations

To analyze the burner reactor, calculations were made by ANISN-
code in the Sy transport-theory approximation and checked in Sg
with 23 energy groups and approx. 100 spatial positions (checked
by 160 spatial positions). P,-approximation cross sections were
produced mostly with the GGC-3 code which utilizes ENDF/B-1 and
-2 and GAM data. Sets for Cs-137, Sr-90 and F were made in

less exact fashion from AAEA and Hansen-Roach data, Fig. 1

shows the group structure.

A reference burner reactor model is shown in Figure 2. The flux
trap 1s surrounded by a BeO spectrum-converter, a critical fuel

thickness, and an outer wall (see Table 2).

Figure 3 shows the calculated flux distributions. The total flux
in the fuel is similar to that in the flux trap. The calculated
fluxes lead to the conclusion (used in section) that o(total

spectrum, flux trap) = 1/2 - o(E = .0253 eV).

3,2 Moderator Requirements

To accomplish a thermal neutron flux trap one must naturally
employ neutron moderating materials in and about it. As is well
known, light materials can scatter neutrons past the neutron-

absorbing intermediate-energy resonance region. Ly is the most

1
efficient nuclide in this respect but also exhibits appreciable
thermal absorption. °D, Je and 6C are usual alternatives. gC

is a bit heavy though frequently already present in a molecular
combination. Other light nuclides have unacceptable nuclear or

physical limitations.

Considering chemical and physical properties, the logical mate-
rials to be used inside the flux trap are hydroxide and/or
deuteroxide compounds of the FP. Figure 4 shows that just a small
proportion of H molar fraction has a large deleterious effect on
the Cs-137 transmutation rate. This is due to the H absorption

cross section. Therefore, CsOD and Sr(0D),, are preferred.

As Sr-90 and Cs-137 also have their fair share of resonances it

is advantageous to thermalize the flux before reaching the flux
trap region containing these targets. Therefore a spectrum con-
verter between flux trap and fast fuel 1s needed. Bearing in mind
the high temperatures to be obtained in this reactor and possible
chemical reactions with molten salt, H,0 and D,0 are unacceptable.
This leaves Be, BeO and graphite or some variant therefore for
consideration, Be (and D) compounds, of course, have also to
their advantage a relatively low (n,2n) threshold (1.67 MeV).
Locatlon next to a fast region can therefore produce considerable
extra slow neutrons in the flux trap - which is a main objective
of the burner reactor. Replacement of Be by C or Mo wall material
should therefore lower the FP transmutation rate, and it does
(Table 3). Figure 5 indicates an optimum thickness of about 5 cm Be.
For the sake of safety and higher melting temperature, BeO is

preferred over Be,

3.3 Motivations for Molten Salt Fuel

In a fast plutonium reactor the average fission cross section is
estimated to be 2.5 barns. The Pu atom density is .,002 atoms

em tpt, The total flux is of the same magnitude as in the flux
trap. The specific power for the Cs-137 burnup is then (using ©

from section 2.2)
N(Pu)o, ©/3.1-10%° = 2.1 (K-1) ¥W em >

The rise of the thermal flux in the fast fuel (Fig. 6) leads
to an order of magnitude increase in the fission density at
the inner fuel boundary. For a solid fuel core the resulting
peak power position would present extreme demands upon coolant

velocity and flow distribution.

To minimize this, the addition of boron in and about the fast
fuel was considered. Reactor calculations were made for 5 to
100 micron-thick intermediate walls as well as for distributed
boron inside the fast region. As seen from Figure 7 the FP
transmutation rate is always reduced; although the spectrum in
the fuel region is harder, the loss of thermal neutrons to the

flux trap has a greater effect.

From the above one sees that the fuel melting point and the
thermohydraullic requirements effect a loss in FP transmutation
rate for solid fuels. One solution might be to use liquid fuel,
cooled out-of-core, Turbulent flow in the core will alleriate
the thermal peaking problem. Also, the melting point limitation

is removed.

The disadvantages arise from the increased fuel inventory in
the burner, e.g. a factor B =e + 0.5 higher. To keep the
system SI low will then require an specific fissile inven-
tory SI in the burner core considerably lower to accomodate
the factor (ratio of inventory in both subsystem) Bi-higher
inventory. Other problems include reduced doubling time,

increased capital costs, and decreased B the effective

fr?
fraction of delayed neutrons in the core,

Proceeding with this concept, the molten salt burner fuel is
assumed to be a mixture of Pucl, and NaCl. Critically will de-
pend upon the Pu concentration and the thickness of the fuel
region, Figure § shows the effect of FuCl, molar fraction upon

specific power, core exit temperature, and Cs-137 transmuta-

tion rate.

S.4  Outer-Reflector Zone Consideration

The large size of the thermal flux trap results in the fuel re-
sion approaching slab geometry with attendant high neutron

leakage. To better economize on neutrons several possibilities

arise

(1) use of an optimum reflector such as Fe, Ni, Cu or Be to
minimize the critical mass

(2) use of the outer neutron leakage for breeding

(3%) use of the outer neutron leakage for additional FP trans-

mutation.

To begin with a solid Fe reflector was assumed (Fig. 9).

The deduced fuel velocity is similar to that postulated by Lane
(1969) for the HFIR reactor: 21 m 571, (The HFIR is also a high

flux irradiation facility).

The specific power in the coolant is about 3 times higher for
the burner than for the indicated breeder concept. Furthermore,
it must be increased by By to account for the increased fuel
inventory in the burner reactor cycle. The crucial problem will
be the efficiency of the external heat exchanger. In the follo-
wing we use some typical heat exchanger characteristics to

examine the possibilities.

5. Further Parameters of the Burner Reactors

 

Parametric studies were made as variations about a reference

pp = 78.5 cm,
The flux trap is surrounded by 5 cm EeQ converter, a critical fuel

system which assumed P = 11 GWatts, (X=2.9, K=4.2) and R

thickness of 6.6 cm, and an outer wall, Figure 11 shows the calcu-
lated flux distributions for such a burner reactor, Note that the
total flux in the fuel is similar to that in the flux trap. The
calculated fluxes lead to the conclusion that o (total spectrum,

flux trap) = 1/2 + o(E=0.0253).

Figure 12 shows the dependence of Cs-137 transmutation rate upon
the burner power level. The higher the power, the greater the
rate. However, power must, of course, be subject to thermohy-

draulic restraints, such as pump and heat exchanger capabilities.

Figure 13 indicates the relative effect of X upon the ratio R
of FP transmutation rate to FP production rate for the reactor
system, One observes the need to keep X low here. Absolute results
will depend upon the Cs and Sr densities in the flux trap. An
actual case of R = 1 for both FP nuclides was achieved at X = 4,5,

The FP atom ratio there was (Cs-137)/(Sr-90) = 7.25.

Another important problem is the relative high flux in the outer

zone, the leakage from the core.

This flux can be used for two purposes:

1) for transmutation of other fission products which have
rather high absorption cross section e.g.
Te-99 a = 22 barn; tR 1/2 5,1°10° a

1-129 o' = 28 varn; tg 1/2 = 1,7-100 a

For improvement of this possibility use of a beryllium moderator

in form of 5 cm wall in the outer region of core have been calcu-
lated. This gave an improvement of transformation rate of Cs-137

in the innter target region but also a very significant increase

of specific power, due to the softening of the neutron flux in

the fuel region has been obtained (Fig. 11).

The possibility of transformation of these two longliving fission

products will be further discussed elsewhere.

The neutron flux outside of the core can be used for breeding in
an uranium blanket. The breeding ratio can be really very good,
higher than 1, but the decrease of the transmutation ratio is
critical, and seems to be too low for a reasonable burner reac-

tor.

In spite of this, in a further study the possibilities must be
checked of using part of a neutron for the breeding process in

an external uranium blanket region.

For fuel in tnls reactor we nave used an arbitrarily chosen
mixture of Purge 3, 0h lar 2,h irl. The calculations have been
done for a pigger burner reactor of 11 GWth and, the whole

[GR

system totaling 55 GWtna.

The neutron flux in the target region was in the case of fluoride
fuel appr. 1.05 times higher than in the reference case with

chloride fuel.

The erfective half-life of both the fission product nuclides

was {in years):

 

In fluoride- In chloride-fuelled
fuelled reactor reactor (reference)
Ce=-137 8.57 8.93
Sr-90 1.753 1.8%

But all tnese benefits must be paid by a twice higher specific
5

power: in [luoride-fuelled core of 19.9 kWem -, and 10,1 lem in

chloride-containing core.

Also because the possibility to use graphite, instead of part of
beryllium oxide as moderator, which seems to be possible from the
point of view of neutronics, a rather important improvement of the
corrosicn problems can be achieved. We must remember that the com-
pativility of molten fluoride fuel and graphite had been proved by
the excellent experience of Oak Ridge Nat. Laboratory (with one

difference: in ORNL experiments the fuel was Lik~Bet -Thi) =U, J.

7. Remarks about transmutation and hazard coefficients

 

It seems to be worthwhile

to make some estimation of the

advantage given by this type of fission-product management.

To operate for sale with only one figure for both nuclides:

Sr-90 and Cs-137 the following mean values have been arbitrary

postulated here:

Thus in the steady state of transmutation the amount of hazardous
substances 1s reduced by factor ~15 in relation to the steady-

state of beta-decay.

The amount of strontium, the most hazardous nuclide, is in a
high-flux reactor burner approximately the same as in the power

reactors after 3 years of fuel burning (fig. 16).

But the most impressive result comes from the considerations
about the "end of the fission power era". The storage (without
transmutation) Caesium-137 and Strontium-90 decayed within
half-life of 39 years, core after ~300 years the amount of

these nuclide will be reduced by factor 1000 (fig. 17).

In a high-flux transmutation the reduction with factor 1000 could
be achieved after approximately 26 years, (fig. 17) i.e. in the
lifetime of one reactor generation (for more exact consideration

see (Taube, Ligou, Bucher, 1975).

Conclusions

These considerations show that a high flux burner reactor for the

transmutation of selected most hazardous fission products as Sr-90

and Cs-137 may be achieved for reasonable assumptions:

1)

2)

1)

the whole system 1s a steady state transmutation system

in the steady-state the amount of transmutated nuclides is
more than one order of magnitude lower than in a spontaneously

beta-decay steady-state,

the ratio of conventional breeder power reactors to the burner
is to about U4, making it possible to organize the fission

power industry.

the whole system 1s still breeding, with a relatively long
doubling time of 30 years. The relative high specific power-
rating of 1 kgPu/MWth, inclusive of the amount of plutonium
out of core (cooling transport, reprocessing) is rather
optimistic but not impossible, especially if a more sophisti-
cated system will be used e.g. GCFBR or MSFBR (Molten Salt
Fast Breeder Reactor) with a quasi-continuously pyrochemical

reprocessing plant
