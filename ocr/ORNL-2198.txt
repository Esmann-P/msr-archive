SUMMARY

This report is concerned with a series of studies which describe the
temperature structure within the core of the ART for several different
entrance flow conditions. Both analytical and experimental techniques of
analysis are used in the investigation. Mean and transient temperature
fields are predicted on the basis of the mathematical behaviour of ideal-
ized cores; these results are compared with experimental temperature meas-
urements obtained in a half-scale model of the ART core, within which the
volume heat sources are generated electrically.

The heat transfer studies presented here reveal the following facts
about the ART core:

1) Unless the core shell walls are cooled, maximum wall temperatures
ranging from 1750°F to 1850°F (depending upon the type of entrance
flow) will exist near the core exit. About three per cent of the
heat generated within the core must be extracted to accomplish
the cooling task.

2) Unless the sodium coolant flows through the cooling annuli in a
uniform fashion, hot and cold spots will exist in the core shells.

3) Peak fuel temperatures at the core exit, under wall cooling con-
ditions, are from 100 to 170°F higher than the mixed-mean fuel
temperature (depending upon the type of entrance flow).

4) The temperature structure within the core is significantly asym-
metric with respect to peripheral position when one pump is not

in operation.
[ -2- Lam

5) The core shell interface and fuel temperatures are transient in >
nature (frequency spectrum ranges from about 1/2 to 4 cycles per
second).
It is stiggested that a greater research effort is required to determine
how seriously these temperature structures influence material strength and
corrosion. Some of the general principles upon which circulating-fuel re-

actors should be designed from the standpoint of heat transfer and fluid

flow are discussed. Several reactor cores other than the ART are reviewed.

INTRODUCTION

During the period 1953-1954, the ANP Project made the decision to de-
sign and construct a 60-Megawatt circulating-fuel reactor of the reflector-
moderated type which was named the ART (reference 1). The circulating fuel
flows into a thick annular core whose flow cross-sectional area increases
by a factor of four from the inlet to the equator, and then decreases by a
factor of four from the equator to the core exit. A preliminary heat trans-
fer analysis of the proposed core configuration was conducted at that time.
It was shown that the ART core would have certain unique thermal character-
istics which would perhaps be undesirable. These characteristics were
identified as follows:

1. Large Radial Temperature Differences Within the Fuel

Mathematical temperature solutions for a simplified flow system
revealed that significant radial fuel temperature differences
would exist in the reactor core primarily because the volume heat
sources within the fuel were high and the mean thickness of the
fuel ennulus was great (reference 2). The core shell wall tempera-
tures were so high that a wall cooling system capable of extract-
ing several per cent of the heat being generated within the core
was required.

2. Asymmetric Temperature Core Shell Structure

From elementary fluid flow considerations, it became apparent that
flow asymmetries could exist under certain circumstances in the

fuel passing through the core or within the sodium flowing in the -

E04 wall-cooling annuli that had been proposed (reference 3). Under

 
am -9- Lo]
such circumstances, asymmetrical core shell temperature dis-
tributions would be established, giving rise to hot spots.

3. Transient Temperature Field

On the basis of fluid flow phenomena, it was believed that the
four-to-one area expansion ratio in the northern hemisphere of
the core would, in general, create unstable flow within the ART
fuel annulus. The combination of a nonuniform radial tempera -
ture profile and an unstable velocity field would, of course,
generate a transient temperature field that could initiate
cyclic thermal stresses in core shell and heat exchanger tube
walls.

One of the first steps taken in evaluating the above problems vas to
study the fluid flow in simple systems that in a sense approximated the
actual ART fuel annulus. Nikuradse's classical experimental study of fluid
flow in diverging and converging channels (reference 4) was used to describe
the flow features in the northern and southern hemisphere of the ART core
for the straight-through flow condition (reference 5). On the basis of
Nikuradse's work, flow asymmetries and transients were predicted to be pre-
sent in the core for this case. The investigation of fluid flow between
curved channels by Wattendorf (reference 6) yielded fundamental information
on velocity and eddy diffusivity distributions which was used to estimate
the asymmetric hydrodynamic structure in the ART core for the case of super-
posed rotational flow (reference 7).

In 1954 the phosphorescent particle technique was first used to study

the flow features in a quarter-scale model of an early version of the ART

 
a -10- boom

core. For straight-through flow, large reverse-flow layers were found to
exist on the outer core wall (reference 8); these were typical of the flow
separations found by Nikuradse in large-angle diverging channels. When a
significant rotational component was superposed on the axial flow, a reverse-
flow layer next to the inner wall in the northern hemisphere was observed
(reference 9). These flow visualization studies as well as a quantitative
investigation of the velocity structure in the core (reference 10) also
demonstrated that the flow was generally transient in nature because of
hydrodynamic instability. These data substantiated the earlier belief that
flow transients would exist in the ART core and supported the prediction
that corresponding temperature transients would also be present. Detailed
information on this hydrodynamic research, chiefly with quarter-scale models,
is to be summarized in ORNL-2199.

Mathematical analyses of the temperature structure in an idealized ART
core with sodium wall cooling were carried out (references 11 and 12). De-
terminations of cooling requirements and sodium flow rates were made. From
these analyses maximum fuel-Inconel and sodium-Inconel interface temperatures
at the core exit were calculated. The presence and magnitude of the high
temperature peak within the fuel a short distance from the core walls was
also described. Inconel-fuel interface temperature fluctuations in the ART
core shell and heat exchanger tubes were considered. Estimates of interface
temperature fluctuations under conditions of momentary flow stagnations and
high-velocity flow instabilities were made.

In order to determine information about the asymmetries in the mean

temperature structure within the ART core and wall and fluid temperature

 
_— a1. a

fluctuations, it was decided to obtain experimentally the core wall and
fluid temperature structures. Several types of entrance flow conditions
were studied in a half-scale core model for the uncooled-wall case. The
volume heat source was generated electrically within an electrolyte which
circulated through the core model. The experimental mean and transient
temperature fields determined in this system were generalized and compared
with predicted temperature fields (references 13 and 14).

After the detailed analytical and experimental descriptions of the
mean and transient ART core temperature structures presented here, the in-
fluence of the temperature field on structural integrity will be considered.
Certain fundamental research on corrosion and material strength 1s suggested

in view of these heat transfer studies.

MATHEMATICAL HEAT TRANSFER ANALYSES

1. Uncooled Core Wall Temperature Structure

It was determined from the ART hot critical experiment that, on the
average, the volume heat source at the core wall was two times as large
as at the centerline. Thus, a new radial temperature solution account-
ing for the source variation in a parallel plates system was derived.
An earlier analysis (reference 2) only accounted for a uniform radial
source distribution. The boundary value problem is defined by the

following equations:

u(r) $F - 2 [ree r)] 3 , HH

ye

bp
on (r = r,) =0 (1)
t (r = ry) = ty

From the activity data obtained in the hot critical experiment by

A. D. Callihan et al, it was determined that the averaged, radial power
density distribution could be represented satisfactorily by a hyperbolic
cosine function (see Figure 1). This power density function together
with the generalized turbulent velocity profile was substituted into the
above differential equation. The solution of this boundary value problem
for established flow was obtained (reference 12), and it was found that
the resulting uncooled-wall temperature above the mixed-mean fluid tempera-
ture was more than twice as great as the corresponding temperature differ-
ence in a uniform volume-heat-source system. The two temperature profiles
in dimensionless form are shown plotted in Figure 2 for Re = 100,000 and

VPri=§ which are representative of ART conditions.

A Cooling Analysis for a Variable-Gap Channel (Idealized ART)

A variable-gap channel representing the spiraling annular passage

through which the fuel flows in the ART with the swirl-flow entrance

was studied. The variable-gap channel was divided into a series of

channels with parallel walls, having different wall spacings. The

heat transfer analyses of these individual channels were performed as

described previously in ORNL-1933. The idealized system shown in

Figure 3 for each channel is defined as follows:

a)
b)
c)
d)

£)

Thermal and hydrodynamic patterns are established (long channels).
Steady state exists.

Volume heat sources exist in the fuel, wall, and coolant.

Physical properties are invariant with temperature.

The fuel channel is being cooled nonuniformly along its length by
the coolant.

The walls of the fuel channel are thin.

The three equations describing heat flow from the fuel to the coolant

can be expressed as,

1. Gamma and neutron heat generated in the beryllium reflectors is carried
away by sodium flowing through cooling holes and annuli. The heat gene-
rated in the thin layers of beryllium (next to the amnuli) flows into
the sodium and hence raises its bulk temperature. In the analysis, this
heat flow was simply treated as an equivalent volume-heatesource term in
the sodium itself. Although this technique correctly accounts for all
the sodium heat transfer, the beryllium-sodium interface temperature is
not explicitly determined. However, a separate calculation of the
beryllium-sodium interface temperature shows that it lies only about

4°F above the bulk sodium temperature.

An entrance length anelysis which is discussed in a later section of this
report showed that the thermal and hydrodynamic flow layers are established
by the time the fuel arrives at the exit of the idealized core. However,
the whole northern hemisphere lies in the entrance region. The fact that
both the local Nusselt number and Atyrs functions vary in compensating

fgg fashions in this entrance region validates the analysis there.

sodium coolant streams are shown plotted in Figure 4. The sodium flow
rates and cooling requirements in the varisble-gep channel system per- -
tained to a passage having identical wall areas from which heat was
transferred to the coolant streams. In the aetual ART annulus system,
the inner and outer wall areas are not identical; thus, the results of
the variable-gap channel analysis were apportioned to accgunt for the
fact that the ART outer wall areca was larger thas the inner wall area.
The flow rates and cooling requirements so obtained follow:
flow rate in inner sedium annulus: 0.071 x 10° 1v/br

3. Radial Fuel Temperature Structure with Wall Cooling

In order to illustrate the nonuniformity of the radial fuel tempera-
ture profile at the exit of the reactor core, the following analysis is
presented. The radial fuel temperature profile for the uncooled wall °
case, under the representative ART conditions of Re = 100,000 and Pr = 4, 3
is graphed in Figure 5. In order to maintain the Inconel-fuel interface
temperature at the core outlet at approximately 50°F below the mixed-mean
fuel temperature, about 3 per cent of the heat generated in the core must
be removed by the wall coolant. The radial fuel temperature profile for
this case was obtained by the superposition process described in reference 11
and is graphed in Figure 5 for purposes of comparison. Note that the peak
fuel temperature above the mixed-mean fuel temperature in the wall-cooled
case was still 62 per cent of the corresponding peak temperature difference
for the uncooled wall case.

An analysis of the degree of decay of the fuel temperature peak, for

the wall-cooled case, in the short passage between the core exit and heat

exchanger entrance will be discussed in a following section of this report.

4. Transient Temperature Analyses
The hydrodynamic studies conducted with the quarter scale ART core
models revealed that, under unstable flow conditions, a series of different -
types of flow phenomena existed in the vicinity of the core walls; high
velocity layers, stagnant layers, and reverse flow or separation layers
could be identified at different moments during the complicated turbulent
history. Two specific transient processes will be considered; namely, the
cases of a momentary flow stagnation and a high velocity eddy for an Inconel-
fluoride system will be analyzed.
-a. Momentary Flow Stagnation
Postulate that, at time equal to zero, the fuel contiguous to the
Inconel wall remains perfectly stagnant for a short period of time
(perhaps several tenths of a second). The problem is to determine the -
transient temperature structure in the Inconel wall, in the adjacent
fuel, and at the interface between the two. The equations which define

this Youndary value problem follow:

_— -25- a

An analytical solution of this set of equations would be laborious”
and was actually not required for this specific study; thus, a solu-
tion was obtained very quickly by the graphical technique. A 0,2
second flow stagnation in the fuel with a volume heat source of 2 kw/cc
created a 208°F temperature rise within the fuel at a sufficient dis-
tance from the wall where heat conduction was no longer important.
However, the Inconel-fuel interface only increased by 48°F during the
same time interval because of the transient conduction of heat into the
Inconel. Thus, in the case of flow stagnation in an Inconel-fuel sys-
tem, the wall-fuel interface fluctuation is only about one-quarter of
the value occurring in the fuel at some distance from the wall.
b. High-Velocity Eddy

Consider the case of a momentary high-velocity eddy which flows
past the core shell wall in the vicinity of the equator where the in-
fluence of the divergent flow exists. The problem is to estimate the
transient temperature structure in the Inconel and fuel for such a
case. The mean boundary layer thicknesses and turbulent conductivities
for the swirl-flow case were obtained from the fundamental velocity
data for simple ducts and converging and diverging channels. Some of

the results are shown in Table 1,

 

A mathematical solution to a slightly simplified boundary value problem
was derived, however, which could be used to closely approximate the
transient temperature behaviour of this system.

On the basis of the hydrodynamic research conducted in quarter-
scale models of the ART, it is believed that the sudden high-velocity
fluctuations observed near the core boundaries were due to momentary
high-velocity eddies which greatly increase radial momentum and heat
transfer during their existence. The following boundary value pro-
blem represents an idealized description of the transient temperature

structure during this event.

It is assumed that the high-velocity eddy suddenly presents the
Inconel and thin laminar sublayer and buffer layer with a new slab of
fuel having a new higher or lower uniform temperature above the initial
datum, t,. This new slab also has a higher eddy conductivity represent-
ative of a region a short distance from the wall where the eddy originated.

The source terms in both the Inconel and fuel have been neglected here.

 
ln -28- bron

A layer of Inconel having the same combined thermal resistance and
capacitance as the thin laminar sublayer and buffer layers was added
to the Inconel wall.

The solution to this boundary value problem is prosaic and can
be found readily in the literature (reference 15). The ratio of the

The high velocity eddy analysis presented above is based on a con-
servative system. From photomicrographs of the surface of Inconel ex-
posed to fuel, it was observed that the surface roughness was of the
same size as the thickness of the calculated laminar sublayer. Many
hydrodynamicists believe that if this is the case, then there would be
no laminar sublayer. Further, the layer thickness used in the above
analysis was calculated for the average flow condition; actually, it
would be thinner because of the momentary higher local velocities. The
thermal resistance and capacitance of the laminar sublayer as well as
the buffer layer were so small that the calculated ratio, t nterrace’ ta’

given above would only increase 12 per cent if these two layers were

neglected. It is also pointed out that in the analysis it was postulated

layer described above.

that a slab of fuel was suddenly exposed to the boundary layers and
the Inconel; however, the high-velocity eddy would continually supply
new fuel, thus further raising the temperature ratio calculated above.
Finally, calculations have been made which show that the thermal con-
ductivity of a layer of Inconel, penetrated uniformly with subsurface
corrosion voids, can suffer a significant reduction. For example,
the reduction in conductivity of a uniformily pitted layer having a
void volume of 30 per cent would be 38 per cent.

The above calculations indicate that high velocity eddies of the
type pictured here can transfer heat so effectively that Inconel-fuel-
interface temperature fluctuations are not drastically reduced below

the temperature fluctuations in the fuel.

EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM

l. Technique

In order to determine a more detailed description of the mean and
transient temperature structure within the ART core, it was decided to
perform a heat transfer experiment in a half-scale model of the core.
The most effective way of generating heat within the volume of an aque-

7

ous solution’ flowing through the model was found to be the "resistance
heating" technique, using alternating current. This method was :found to
possess the following advantages:

a) High specific powers are attainable.

b) Fluid and surface temperature measurements can readily be made.

c) Proper electrode spacing: and voltage regulation yield control

of the power density distribution.

d) Power densities can be accurately determined from voltage and

current measurements.

In order to obtain sufficiently large temperature differences within
the electrolyte flowing through the core, intense volume heat sources had
to be generated. It was observed, however, if the alternating current
densities at the electrodes of the system were in excess of a certain

value, then undesirable hydrogen and oxygen liberation would occur at the

electrode surfaces. Hence, it was necessary to so adjust the electrical

not found to be readily applicable; they were induction, dielectric,
ultrasonic, and radiant heating.

ad

resistivity of the electrolyte, by varying the specific gravity, so that a

maximum current density just below the critical value for gas generation
was obtained. It was also found that platinum electrodes made it possible
to obtain higher current densities. Further details on electrolysis re-
search can be found in Appendix 1.
2. Electrode Geometry

It was found essentially impossible to create an electric flux field
within the electrolyte flowing through the core which would generate a
volume heat source that would peak sharply at the core wall as previously
shown in Figure 1. It was possible, however, to create.an electric flux
field which was nearly uniform throughout the whole core. It is possible
to transform the experimental temperature profiles obtained in the uniform
power density case to those corresponding to the nonuniform power density
case (ART) with the aid of the mathematical temperature solutions carried
out previously for these two systems.

The electrode arrangement used in the experiment is shown in Figure 6.
It can be shown that if the axial potential gradient is a uniform value
throughout a conducting system (linear voltage drop), a uniform volume
heat source will be generated. The electrode arrangement in Figure 6
Yylelded a potential field that had an axial potential gradient that was
within + 6 per cent of being uniform (excluding the extreme ends of the
potential field); this means that the volume heat source was within + 12

per cent of being uniform. The potential difference of each electrode set

was adjusted such that the potential drop between adjacent electrodes re-

A dilute solution of sulfuric acid (1% by weight) was used for the i

3. Flow Circuit

A perspective drawing of the ART volume-heat-source system is shown
in Figure 7. The components consist of an electrolyte reservoir, two
centrifugal pumps, flow-control valves, and orifice meter, the half-scale
core model, and a water-cooled heat exchanger. The entire flow system
was enclosed by plywood and Plexiglas walle in order to protect the opera-
tors from sulfuric acid in the event of a system leak. The electrolyte
was pumped from the reservoir to the test section (where heat was generated
within its volume) to the heat exchanger (where it was cooled) and finally
back to the reservoir. Information on materials of construction and flow
system components, excluding the core model which will be described next,
can be found in Appendix 3.

4. Half-Scale Core Model

Figure 8 shows a cross-sectional view of the core model including
entrance and exit sections. A transparent Plexiglas pipe was located at
the core entrance so that the presence of entrained gas in the electrolyte
could be observed. A mixing chamber used to obtain a mixed-mean fluid
temperature was also located in this pipe. The two flow control valves

located above the pump volutes were used to simulate single and dual ART

pump operation. A view of the pump volutes and the core entrance region

is shown in Figure 9, The flow either spiraled through the core unguided

(swirl-flow entrance) or was guided by a set of turning venes (vaned-flow

Plastic surface, and twenty-four No. 30 gauge pPlatinum-platinum + 10% rhod iui
thermocouples which were honed flush with the wall surfaces. In all cases,
the junctions were of the butt type, and the couples were positioned in a
Plane parallel to the wall-fluid interface. Figure 11 shows a view looking
down into the core from the entrance. This photograph was made after the
first two sets of runs were completed. The simulated bellows on the island
is observed in the center, and around it are seen the dark Platinum elec-
trode rings in the outer wall of the core. Several copper-constantan ther-
mocouples may be seen through their transparent Araldite resin coverings.
The copper-constantan thermocouples were spaced at five axial stations;
four were located 90° apart at each station on the inner and outer walls.
The platinum-platinum + 10% rhodium thermocouples were spaced at four axial
stations; three were located 120° apart at each station on the inner and
outer walls. Table 2 gives the couple positions.

Platinum tubes, 1/16 inch in dismeter, with platinum + 10% rhodium wires
inside joined at the tips were fashioned into thermocouple probes whose Jjunc-
tions were positioned in the flow stream 1/8 inch below the exit plane (see
Figure 12). The probe tips were rotated 45° from the vertical so that they
faced in the general direction of the rotating flow from the exit of the
core,

thermocouple leads in place can be seen in Figure 13.
5. Power Circuit and Instrumentation
Figure 14 shows a schematic diagram of the electrical power system.
A saturable reactor shown in the diagram was only used to control the
voltages of the end electrodes at certain times. The voltages of the
intermediate electrodes (3 through 22) were controlled in pairs by vari-
able autotransformers. The power level was controlled by varying the
strength of the acid solution up to one per cent by weight, thus changing
its resistivity. The maximum total power dissipated in the test section
was about 125 KW. -
Figure 15 shows a photograph of the control and instrument panels.
The power control Variacs are on the panels at the right with their volt-
meters and ammeters. An accurate voltmeter (less than one per cent error)
with a selector switch so that any electrode potential could be measured
was installed later and used throughout the experiments. Accurate ammeters
(less than one per cent error) were used to measure the currents drawn by
the electrodes. The total electrical power dissipated within the core model
was obtained by summing the individual wattages consumed by the individual
electrode pairs.
Mean temperature measurements were obtained with the copper-constantan
thermocouples. The voltages of these couples were recorded on four twelve-

point recording potentiometers which are shown at the far left in Figure 15;

portable precision potentiometers were used most of the time to obtain these
voltages, however. The platinum-platinum + 10% rhodium thermocouples, which
were normally used to obtain transient data, were also used to determine
mean voltages to verify the copper-constantan measurements,

Two methods of measuring temperature fluctuations were used. One con-
sisted of connecting a sensitive mirror galvanometer, made by the Hathaway
Instrument Company, to the platinum-platinum + 10% rhodium thermocouples
(see Figure 16). Galvanometer deflections were then calibrated in terms
of couple voltages or temperatures. Motion pictures were made of the gal-
vanometer deflections. The second method of measuring transient tempera-
tures involved using a Brush recorder with a special isolated preamplifierd.
A photograph of this system is shown in Figure 17.

To protect the test section and the people working with the experiment,
several automatic safety controls were included in the electrical system.
The power circuit to the core model was instantaneously opened by control
equipment when the following events occurred:

a) reduction of electrolyte flow rate below a preset value

b) reduction of cooling water flow rate below a preset value

c) opening of door to room containing the volume-heat-source

experiment.
An alarm system immediately made known the occurrence of any of the above

events.

 

8. This amplifier had an input circuit which was isolated from the remainder
of the circuit. This permitted the detection of small varying D.C. volt-
ages in the presence of high A.C. potentials. The amplifier circuit was
modified so that the range of flat frequency response was increased.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

Calibration
a. Brush Recorder and Hathaway Systems
When all the transient thermocouples within the core model were
held at some kmown, uniform environment temperature, a zero reading
was obtained on the Brush recorder. The enviromment temperature was
then raised to some new uniform temperature level and the deflection
of the Brush recorder again noted. The calibration constant was there-
by derived directly in degrees centigrade per recorder scale division.
An alternate method of calibrating the Brush recorder was used to verify
the previous method. A direct current signal was applied to the Brush
amplifier and then changed by a known increment. This increment was
then converted to a temperature change, and the Brush recorder scale
deflection was noted. The calibration constant so obtained was found
to be within 5 per cent of the one determined by the previous method.
The Hathaway system was calibrated in the following manner. The
output of the platinum-platinum + 10% rhodium thermocouple was impressed
directly upon the galvanometer suspension. The light arm deflection was
noted for a given thermocouple environment temperature. The temperature
level was then raised a known number of degrees, and the deflection of
the light arm recorded.
b. Thermocouple Response
An experimental and analytical study of the response of the tran-

sient thermocouples under periodic and step function conditions was

 

 

 
— -5o- 2

conducted. It was found that the thermocouple response itself was far
greater than those associated with the Brush recorder and Hathaway gal-
vanometer suspension systems.
c. Frequency Response of Recorder and Galvanometer
Calibration of the frequency response of the Brush recorder was
accomplished by impressing a known signal of variable frequency on
the system input. The amplitude of the output on the Brush oscil-
lograph was measured, and the results appear in Appendix 4 in terms
of percentage of D-C response versus frequency in cycles/sec. A
similar calibration of the frequency response of the Hathaway mirror
galvanometer was made. The results are also presented in Appendix 4.
Both of these Brush recorder and Hathaway response curves show that
the 60 cycle per second response is very small compared to the low
frequency spectrum.
d. Orifice Meter
The orifice meter was calibrated by measuring the weight flow

rates and manometer deflections over the range of operating conditions.
The calibration for a two-inch orifice is presented in Appendix 4; a
graph of the mean Reynolds number as a function of manometer deflection
can also be found there.

2. Operational Technique
Four sets of volume-heat-source experiments were conducted during this

investigation. Two sets of measurements were made with a swirl-flow en-

trance; in one case, both simulated pump inlets were open, and in the other

—
Vira
_— -51- en

case, one inlet was closed. Two additional sets of measurements were
obtained with vanes located at the core entrance; the one and two pump
flow simulation was again examined.

All heat transfer and fluid flow data were recorded only after the

following steps were completed in the indicated sequence:

a) The system was filled with the electrolyte.

b) The electrolyte was circulated through the system by means of
the two pumps.

c) The datum temperature of the electrolyte was maintained by an
automatically controlled cooling water flow rate in the heat
exchanger.

d) A predetermined voltage distribution for the electrode system
was established before the power was applied.

e) Power was turned on.

f) A final check was made on the desired electrode voltage dis-
tribution as shown in Figure 6.

g) Thermal equilibrium was established in the flow system. The
external core model environment temperature was matched to the
mean wall temperature within the core in order to establish the
uncooled-wall condition.

During the subsequent period of data recording, it was observed that

the mean temperature and electric flux fields were extremely stable. For
example, the variation in the mean temperature structure was less than

one-quarter of one per cent. Further, only negligibly small gaseous elec-

rol. products existed in the exit flow as detected by the Tyndall light

scattering effect. A minute amount of leakage current was conducted

through the external flow circuit from the core (less than 0,001 amps).

MEAN AND TRANSIENT TEMPERATURE RESULTS

     

1. Swirl-Flow Case; Two Pumps
Fifteen complete power runs were made for the core model using the

swirl-flow entrance.

   

Both flow valves were open, thus simulating the ART

  

flow with both pumps in operation. The ranges of parameters investigated
follow:
66,000 < Re < 256,000
hh <Pr<s
5<t  -t, <10°F
0.08 < P_ < 0.12 Megawatts
The heat balances obtained for the system were within + 5 per cent of being
perfect. Typical mean’, uncooled wall and mixed-mean fluid temperature
profiles obtained in these experiments with a uniform volume heat source
- are presented in Figure 18 in a.generalized form. The asymmetries in the
outer and inner core wall temperatures can be explained on the basis of
hydrodynemic asymmetries. For example, the high inner core wall tempera-
ture in the northern hemisphere existed because of a separation region which
completely encompassed the inner wall (island wall) in that region.
The hydrodynamic structure in the northern hemisphere of both the swirl-
flow and vaned-flow entrance cases is extremely complex. The shear stress

and turbulence distributions are unknown in that region. Therefore, it was

. a particular location as well as an average with respect to peripheral
position.

felt that predictions of the detailed, uncooled-wall temperature structure
in the entrance region would probably be too simplified and hence were not
made? A calculation of the entrance length in a simple parallel plates
system was made along the lines of Latzko's analysis (reference 16). It

was found that the entrance length for the swirl-flow case was about 36
dismete#s. This meant that the flow was established in most of the southern
hemisphere because the physical, vectorial channel length in this case was
also 36 diameters. Consequently, the solution for established temperature
structure ih a Zarallel Plates system (reference 2) was used to predict the
local uncooled wall-fluid temperature difference in the southern hemisphere.

It can be shown that,

This relation was evaluated with the aid of the solution in reference 2 for
the swirl-flow case and is seen graphed in Figure 18; the predicted tempera-
ture profile lies between the experimental temperature profiles for the
inner and outer walls. .

Variations in the experimental uncooled core wall temperatures with
respect to peripheral position were observed in the system. For example,

the uncooled wall-fluid temperature difference, on the inner wall in the

analyses pertaining to entrance regions in simple flow systems were
derived, Cases where both thermal and hydrodynamic patterns are being

in the future.

equatorial region, varied by plus or minus 30 per cent from the mean wall-
fluid temperature difference at that plane. The corresponding variations
in wall-fluid temperature difference for the cooled-wall core would prob-
ably be much less because the peripheral variation in the heat transfer
coefficient no doubt would be a compensating factor.

The experimental temperature profiles obtained for the uniform power
density case were transformed to those corresponding to the radial, non-
uniform power density case (Figure 1) with the aid of the mathematical
temperature analyses presented earlier in this report. The axial mixed-
mean temperature distributions for both the ART axial power distribution
(reference 21) and the uniform axial pover distribution are compared in
Figure 19. The maximum difference is seen to be less than one per cent
of the total mixed-mean temperature rise. The results can be seen in
Figure 19 together with a corresponding analytical solution. Note that
wall temperatures as high as 1750°F would occur if the wall were not
cooled.

Typical transient wall and fluid temperature data are shown in Fig-
ure 20 in terms of the total temperature fluctuation divided by the axial
temperature rise of the fluid going through the core. The frequencies of

~ the temperature fluctuations for this half-scale model varied from about
one-half cycle per second to four cycles per second, The frequency range
of temperature fluctuations in the full-scale ART system, operating with
fluoride fuel, should be similar to that in the half-scale model experi-
ment with the acid solution. A simple average of the maximum wall and

f¥uld temperature fluctuations with respect to peripheral position was

obtained. Typical measurements uncorrected for frequency response are
shown plotted as a function of axial distance in Figure 21 for the uniform

power density case. These fluctuations would, of course, be larger

 

the nonuniform power density case. Note that the outer wall temperate
fluctuations are greater than those measured at the inner wall; this 4if-
ference appears to reflect the Rayleigh stability criterion. A detailed
frequency response correction is laborious because of the difficulty in
determining instantaneous frequencies for the complex fluctuation spectrum.
However, on the basis of a mean fluctuation frequency of about two cycles
per second, one would expect to increase the magnitude of the fluctuations
given in Figure 21 by a factor of about 1.5.
2. Vaned-Flow Case; Two Pumps

Six complete power runs were made for the core model using the vaned-
flow entrance. Again, both valves were opened to simulate normal ART
operating conditions. The ranges of parameters investigated follow:

mean, uncooled-wall and mixed-mean fluid temperature profiles for a uni-
form volume heat source are presented in Figure 22. Note that the high
inner wall temperatures in the northern hemisphere obtained in the pre-

vious swirl-flow case are no longer present because the vane system almost

uncooled-wall temperatures in all other regions were higher for the vaned-

flow case than those for the swirl-flow case because the latter case was ou

“

characterized by a significantly higher vector Reynolds number.

A calculation revealed that the entrance length in a simple parallel
plates system corresponding to the vaned-flow case was about 29 diameters.
Since the physical vectorial channel length was only 16 diameters for this
case, the thermal boundary layers were about 67 per cent of the fully estab-
lished values at the idealized core exit. However, the analytical, uncooled-
wall temperature profile for the southern hemisphere shown in Figure 22 was
carried out for established temperature conditions.

Peripheral variations in the experimental uncooled-wall temperatures
were again observed. However, they were generally larger than those found
in the swirl-flow case. For example, the uncooled wall-fluid temperature
difference, on the inner wall in the equatorial region, varied by + 90 per
cent from the mean temperature difference at that plane.

The experimental temperature profiles obtained for the uniform power
density case were transformed to those corresponding to the nonuniform
power density case as was done previously. The results can be observed in
Figure 23 together with the analytical prediction. Note that wall tempera-
tures as high as 1850°F would result if the walls were not cooled.

Typical transient wall and fluid temperature data for the vaned-flow
case are presented in Figure 24. The frequency spectrum of the temperature .
fluctuation for this case was, in general, similar to the one found for the

swirl-flow case. However, at certain flow conditions in the northern

the vaned-flow case. Maximum wall and fluid temperature Fluctuations ee
averaged with respect to peripheral position, are shown in Figure 25 aC
function of axial position; frequency response corrections were not nel.
The outer wall temperature fluctuations in the northern hemisphere were
significantly lower for the vaned-flow condition than in the previous case.
However, wall and fluid temperature fluctuations in the southern hemisphere
were somewhat larger for the vaned-flow case. These increases in fluctu-
ation magnitudes appear to correspond to similar increases in the mean radial
temperature differences for the vaned-flow case. ,
The four heavy platinum thermocouple probes located just beyond the
core exit were used to obtain local fluid temperature fluctuations as well
as a mean radial fluid temperature distribution in that region. The tran-
sient temperature distribution within a platinum probe was calculated for
the case of a sudden step function increase in the temperature of the elec-
trolyte flowing past the probe. A similar calculation was made for the
probe on the basis that it was made of Inconel rather than platinum’. It
was shown that shortly after the step function had been applied to the two
systems (about 0.03 seconds), the fluid-metal interface temperatures of both

probes increased almost by the same amount. The centerline temperature of

nearly equal.

the platinum probe (where the thermocouple was located) had increased by
an amount that was 88 per cent of the temperature rise at the probe-fluid
interface. However, in the case of the Inconel probe, the centerline tem-
perature increased by an amount that was only 61 per cent of the temperature
rise at the probe-fluid interface; for this case, the centerline temperature
had only increased by 18 per cent above the original initial temperature
level as compared to a 52 per cent increase for the platinum probe. Further,
more than one and one-half times as much heat was transferred to the platinum
probe. These simple calculations indicated that the temperature fluctuations
measured in the center of the platinum probe would be at least as large as
those which would exist at the surface of an Inconel tube located at that
position under such rapid transient conditions.

A graph of the mean radial fluid temperature distribution just beyond
the core outlet in terms of the mixed-mean fluid temperature at core in-
let and outlet can be seen in Figure 26. The uncooled core wall tempera-
ture profile is not symmetrical about the channel centerline’; its shape
is quite similar to the theoretical one shown previously in Figure 2. It
is noted in Figure 26 that, upon the comparison of the measured fluid tem-
perature distribution with the mixed-mean fluid temperature at exit, more
area between the two curves lies above the mixed-mean temperature than
lies below it. This is as expected, because the mixed-mean fluid tempera-
ture is averaged with respect to velocity as well as temperature. Hydro-

dynamic studies have shown that more fluid flows axially through the inner

 

12. The reason for this temperature asymmetry will be more fully discussed
in a following section of this report.

portion of the channel at exit than flows in the outer portion. It is
also pointed out that the radial fluid temperature profile plotted in
Figure 26 is based on only four thermocouple determinations; it would
have been desirable to have had more data to establish a mean profile.

It was of interest to determine what the peak fuel temperatures would
be in the ART core exit. These temperatures were estimated for both the
swirl-flow and vaned-flow cases as follows:

a) The experimental radial temperature profiles for uniform volume-

 heat-source conditions were transformed to profiles corresponding
to an averaged nonuniform volume-heat-source distribution (see
Figure 1).

b) The results of the wall cooling analysis described in the section
on Mathematical Heat Transfer Analyses were ther used to determine
the peak fuel temperatures.

Local fuel temperatures so estimated ranged from 100°F to 170°F higher than
mixed-mean fluid temperatures for the swirl-flow and vaned-flow cases, re-
spectively.

The complicated question of how much decay takes place in the fuel
temperature peek (for the wall-cooled case as described in Figure 5) as
the fuel flows through the short exit passage to the heat exchanger en-
trance was investigated. This passage was divided into two regions. The
first half of the passage was treated as a simple curved-wall channel sys-
tem, and the second half was considered to be a simple straight channel.

The decay of the turbulent thermal boundary layer in the curved channel

WA a

 
—_— -1o- bs

system on the convex side (where the high temperature peak exists) was

 

4

carried out by the usual Von Karman technique with the exception that, in

this case, hydrodynamic data (velocity profiles and wall shear stresses)
characteristic of curved channel systems were used. The results for the
first half of the passage showed that, on the convex side, the boundary
layer would take about 80 diameters to become established (because of the
great decrease in eddy diffusivity on that side of the channel). As the
physical length of that portion of the passage was only 9 diameters, a
negligible decay of the peak would occur in that region. Thermal boundary
layer decay in the second half of the passage was calculated on the basis
of the work of Latzko (reference 16) for straight ducts. The results in-
dicated that it would take about 33 diameters for the thermal boundary
layers to become established; the physical length of that portion of the -
passage was only 9 diameters. On the basis of the functional relation-

ship between boundary layer thickness with axial distance in the passage,

this means that at the heat exchanger entrance there would be approximately

a 36 per cent decay of the original fuel temperature peak. On the basis

of these simplified decay analyses and the previous experimental and an-

alytical studies of the fuel temperature structure within the core itself,

it was estimated’ that peak fuel temperatures at the heat exchanger en-

trance will be about 90°F in excess of the mean fluid temperature for the

 

13. Peak fuel temperatures were calculated at the core exit in the manner
outlined in the previous paragraph. However, the actual volume-heat-
source distribution near the outer wall was used rather than the aver- .
aged profile shown in Figure 1.

for the vaned-flow case.

3. Swirl-Flow and Vaned-Flow Cases; One Pump

 

During both the swirl-flow and vaned-flow experiments, a series of
runs were made for the simulated case of one-pump operation. In general,
it was found that relatively large peripheral and axial asymmetries ex-
isted in the uncooled-wall temperature distributions. The wall and fluid
temperature fluctuations were also larger than had been found for the cor-
responding two-pump experiments. Typical uncooled-wall temperature data
are shown in Figure 27 for the swirl-flow case. The peripheral locations
of individual temperature measurements are not indicated in the figure.
Note that now, some points lie below the mixed-mean fluid temperature and

other points lie far above.

GENERAL COMPARISON OF HYDRODYNAMIC AND THERMAL FIELDS

It is obvious from analytical considerations that there is a direct
relationship between the hydrodynamic and thermal fields for a given flow
system. The forced coniiifneat transfer equations contain heat flow
functions that are uniquely defined in terms of the fluid velocity com-
ponents.

Several specific examples of how the steady velocity field influences
the steady temperature field have already been mentioned in the past section;
it may be of interest, at this point, to examine in more detail one such
case. In Figure 18, it was observed that the uncooled outer core wall tem-
perature at the core exit was significantly greater than the one at the
inner wall. This feature can be explained by studying the vectorial veloc-
ity distributions in the southern hemisphere shown in Figure 28. Note that
these velocity profiles, which were determined from experimental axigl and
tangential velocity measurements (reference 17), are asymmetric in shape.
Consider the channel flow to be divided into a narrow inner layer and a
wide outer layer, which possesses a somewhat lower velocity. From the pre-
viously developed analytical temperature solutions for a simple parallel
plates system, it would be expected that the outer uncooled core wall tem-
perature would be greater than the corresponding inner temperature.

A comparison of the transient velocity and temperature fields was also
made. A study of the fluctuating velocity structure in the vicinity of the

core walls was carried out with motion pictures (reference 18) of dye fila-

ments in a full-scale plastic model of the core. Frequencies of the fluid

well as by observing angular displacements. Figure 29 shows a plot of
the angular dye filament displacements as a function of time, together
with wall temperature fluctuation measurements obtained in the half-
scale volume-heat-source system; both sets of measurements were determined
for the outer wall in the equatorial region. The velocity data presented
in Figure 29 suggests a mean frequency of perhaps one cycle per second,
whereas, the wall temperatures appear to be varying with a frequency of
about two cycles per second. This agreement is satisfactory because the
fluctuation frequency in the half-scale model should be double that of

the full-scale water model at the same Reynolds number. No attempt was
made to compare the magnitude of the dye filament deflections with the
temperature amplitudes chiefly because the exact locations of the dye

filaments from the core wall were variable and unknown.

 

14. Note, since the temperature frequency spectrum was limited to 1/2 to
4 cycles per second, only the fundamental mode of the velocity data
should be compared to the temperature data.

CONCLUSIONS
l. ART Core

The following statements about the thermal structure within the ART
core can be made on the basis of the results obtained from the heat trans-
fer and fluid flow research presented here:

a) Unless the core shell walls are cooled, maximum wall temperatures
ranging from 1750°F to 1850°F (depending upon the type of entrance
flow) will exist near the core exit. About 3 per cent of the heat
generated within the core must be extracted to accomplish the
cooling task.

b) Unless the sodium coolant flows through the cooling annuli in a

15

uniform fashion”, hot and cold spots will exist which will in-
fluence local shape, strength, and corrosion of the core shells.

c) Local fuel temperatures at the core exit, under wall cooling con-
ditions, are from 100°F to 170°F higher than the mixed-mean fuel
temperature (depending upon the type of entrance flow). Decay
calculations indicate that peak fuel temperatures will not be at-
tenuated markedly as the fuel flows through the short exit passage
to the heat exchanger entrance. These nonuniform fuel temperature

distributions must be taken into account in estimating heat ex-

changer wall temperatures.

 

15. A study of the nonuniformity of the sodium flow through the cooling
annuli for two types of eccentric flow conditions was conducted and
the results reported in reference 19.

d) The temperature structure within the core becomes significantly
asymmetric with respect to peripheral position when one pump is
not in operation.

e) The core shell interface and fuel temperatures are transient in
nature (frequency spectrum ranges from about 1/2 to 4 cycles per
second). Cyclic stress calculations, on the basis of these tem-
perature fluctuations, indicate that stresses as large as + 13,000
psi will exist in the surface layers of the Inconel core shells
if the metal 1s elastic. The influence of these temperature fluc-
tuations on corrosion and material strength is unknown at present.

It has been demonstrated that some hot spots as well as some high fre-

quency thermal cycling will exist in the ART system. This suggests that a
greater research effort is required to determine how seriously these temper-
ature structures influence material strength and corrosion. Some thermal

cycling research has already been initiated by the Heat Transfer and Physical

Properties Section.

2. Reflector-Moderated Reactor Cores in General

During the past several years, the heat transfer and fluid flow re-
search on high-temperature reflector-moderated reactors has brought to
light certain fundamental problems which prevent the attainment of opti-
mum thermodynamic efficiencies. These problems are:

a) High fuel temperatures exist at the core walls which must be

reduced by substantial wall cooling.

b) Radial fuel temperature distributions are normally so nonuniform
in character that the highest mixed-mean fuel temperatures at the
core outlets cannot be realized.

c) Nonuniform radial fuel temperature distributions generate hot
spots and significant temperature fluctuations if the fluid flow
1s asymmetrical and unstable in character.

d) Complex moderator-cooling components are required to cool low-
temperature moderators.

In order to remedy problems a, b, and c listed above, it is necessary
to develop a circulating-fuel reactor core whose fuel temperature distri-
bution is nearly uniform with respect to radius. This can be achieved in
two ways: 1) generate a high turbulence level within the fuel by mechani-
cal means and 2) control the fuel velocity distribution so that very little

radial heat flow occurs.

 
_— -

3. New Core Configurations

 

One method of generating a high turbulence level within the fuel is
to’ £111 a fraction of the core volume with packing such as screens; this
configuration would destroy thermal boundary layers. The hydrodynamic
studies describing this method will be reported in ORNL-2199. Two prob-
lems associated with such a core would be the increase in the effective
absorption cross-section of the reactor and the cooling of the packing,
particularly under zero fuel flow conditions.

It has recently been shown that the stabilizing effect of a forced
vortex within a circular tube permits the generation of axial fluid ve-
locity distributions of many desired forms. A unique tubular fuel element
based on this principle has been developed (reference 20) which makes it
possible to control the velocity structure so that a nearly uniform radial
temperature distribution can be obtained. A reactor core utilizing this
fuel element would have the following advantages:

a) A separate core-wall cooling system is not required.

b) An optimum thermodynamic efficiency can be achieved.

c) Hot spot and thermal cycling problems would be greatly reduced.

d) If a high-temperature reflector-moderator is used in the system,

the fuel velocity structure can be so controlled at the core walls

so that "fuel cooling" of the moderator can be achieved.

APPENDIX 1

 

Electrolysis Research

An experiment was conducted to determine separately the effects of
voltage, current density, frequency, electrode materials, and tempera-
ture on electrolytic gas evolution. The results of this experiment in-
dicated that current density, frequency, and electrode materials were
significant. Faraday's law (the proportionality between liberated gas
and current) was verified at bare electrode surfaces. Further, for a
given amount of gas liberation at an electrode surface, the amount of
gas liberated per unit surface area decreases as the total electrode
area increases.

During the search for electrode materials, it was found that platinum
possessed the unique property of forming a finely divided platinum surface
film, which materially reduced electrolytic gas liberation. This is the
result of the recombination of oxygen and hydrogen due to the catalytic
action of the film. Measurements were made with time of the 60 cycle cur-
rent required to initiate gas liberation at the surface of a platinum elec-
trode of known area. As a result of the surface film accumulation, the
current was observed to increase with time and eventually level off at ap-
Proximately 12 amps/in°, When this value was reached, the surface was con-
sidered fully passivised. However, 6 amps/1n° was used conservatively as
a design criterion.

Since the liberation of gas may be considered an effect of polarization,

a stu

nf

was also made of the influence of power source frequency on gas

  

 

 
 

—_— =

generation. For a constant gas generation rate at a passivised platinum

electrode surface in a 5 per cent H,80), solution, determinations were
made of the required surface current density with frequency to initiate
gassing. These results are given in Figure 30, where 1t appears that
the surface current density varies directly as the square root of the

frequency; namely,
0 ~/f (18)

This expression is the well-known Warburg law, which relates polarization
at electrodes to frequency.

This study indicates that if one employs the resistance heating method

of volume power generation, the following factors must be considered:
| a) Platinum electrodes are superior to other types.

b) High frequency electric currents make it possible to attain
higher power densities without gas liberation at the electrode.
However, the frequency must not be so great that the "skin effect"
becomes important.

¢) For a given system with a fixed electrical power frequency, the
volume heating intensity 1s proportional to the applied voltage,
since the maximum surface current density is established.

d) Electrode arrangements should be such as to distribute the cur-

rent over the greatest electrode area.

Materials of Construction and Flow System Components

vig]

a. Maberiaiator Construction

The materials directly in contact with the H,S50), solution were
Carpenter 20 alloy, platinum, Micarta plastic, Boltaron plastic, Araldite
resin, Plexiglas, Pyrex, Teflon, and Neoprene. The pumps, heat exchanger,
and flow regulator valves were also constructed of Carpenter 20 alloy.
The core model (see Figure 8 for cross section) was made primarily of
close-grain Micarta and platinum.
b. The Half-Scale Core Model

The exact half-scale model of the proposed ART core was constructed
of laminated Micarta sheets in which were imbedded platinum rings of the :
desired shape. Bus bars contacting the electrodes conducted the current
radially outward. The thermocouples, which were in contact with the elec-
trolyte between the electrodes, were composed of platinum-platinum + 10%
rhodium.
¢c. System Components

Two 20-h.p. Carpenter 20 single-stage centrifugal pumps withdrew the
electrolyte from a glass-lined, 300-gallon reservoir. Carpenter 20 alloy
globe valves regulated the electrolyte flow rates to a maximum of 200
gal/min at a 200-foot head. A thin plate VDI-type 2-inch diameter orifice

in conjunction with a 50-inch manometer was used to measure electrolyte

flow rates. The high resistance external electrical curcuit was insured

FJ

 
—— 3 SE

by means of Boltaron plastic piping in the flow system ducting electrolyte
to and from the core.

The Carpenter 20 alloy heat exchanger was of the cross-counter flow
type having 50 one-half-inch tubes on three-fourth-inch centers in a tri-

angular array. The outer diameter was 12 inches, with a total length of

12 feet, including the headers.

The electrolyte temperature level was maintained by means of a 2-inch
pneumatic valve, which controlled the flow rate of cooling water through

the heat exchanger in conjunction with an automatic regulator.

versus the manometer deflection appears in Figure 39. The variation of the
mean axial Reynolds number within the core is plotted with the manometer

deflection in Figure 40.
