PRELIMINARY STUDY OF A MOLTEN-SALT BURST REACTOR

A.M. Perry W. B. McDonald
HE. F. Bauman J. T. Mihalczo

The question has been posed whether one could pulse a molten-salt
reactor so as to achieve an integrated flux of 101© neutrons/ cm? per
burst in a test cavity at the center of the reactor, and, if so, what
energy yield would be required and what would be the shape of the pulse?
The nominal objectives appear to be:

1) 1-2 X 10*® neutrons/cn® per burst, without a tight specification
on the neutron spectrum,

2) a burst width in the neighborhood of 10 msec or less.

Since it appears that the second objective should be easy to satisfy,
we have looked at the possibility of achieving the first without much
regard for factors which might influence the burst shape, and have sub-
sequently estimated the burst width for one of several reactor con-

figurations one might contemplate using.

1. Selection of Salt

 

The calculations were based on use of the salt LiF (73 mole 4)
UF, (27 mole %), and for each reactor considered, the critical enrich-
‘ment of the uranium was determined. Separated Li” would of course be
used.

Relevant properties of the salt are:

Melting point, °C Loo
Specific heat of the melt, cal/gm °C 0.217

Density of the melt, gm/cm® 5.26 — 9.3 x 107% T(°C)

2. Allowable Energy Input

 

We postulate that the temperature of the salt could be allowed to

 

rise 1000°C, i.e., nominally from 500°C to 1500°C. The properties

given above yield the following values at 1000°C (average temperature):

  
‘Density’ 4.33 gm/cn’®
Specific heat 4 wsec/em® °C
Thus, the integrated flux that can be obtained in the test cavity

corresponds to a maximum energy density of Lh kwsec/ cn’ per burst.

3, Geometry

For the purposes of this preliminary exploration, we postulate

spherical geometry, with concentric regions and dimensions as follows:

Test cavity (void) 15 cm radius

Ni shell 1 cm thick.
Fueled salt 15 to 60 cm thick
Ni shell 5 em thick
Graphite shell . 25 em thick

An additional case was examined with the thickness of the outer Ni con-
teiner increased to 15 cm, and the graphite shell omitted; this was

done for a 60-cm-thick salt region.

4, Results

The integrated fluxes obtainable in the test cavity are shown for
each case in Table 1, along with geometrical specifications and other
"derived results. Some of these results are also plotted in Fig. 1.
. The neutron spectrum for case #8, with 92-cm-0D core (3 ft) is
shown in Fig. 2, as the integral above energy E, as a function of E,;

i.e.,

[at [7 ow 0)aw ,
BE .

where the time integration 1s taken over the duration of the burst. For

 

comparison, the fission spectrum is also given, normalized to 1 X 1016
neutrons. oo .

In case #3, which was the same es case #1, except that the S-cm Ni
and 25-cm graphite shells were replaced by a single 15-cm Ni shell, both
the pesk-to-average power density ratio and the integrated flux in the

test cavity were the same as in case #1.

An estimate of the burst width was made for case #2 (not listed
in Table 1) which was the same as case #1 except that the graphite shell
thickness was 10 cm. The Rossi a at delayed critical, Cys Was calcu-
lated, by use of the DIF transport code, and found to be 9 X 10° sec™*,
The burst width was estimated approximately from the expression*

ot = 3.5/a,

where QO = 3 (p—1) and p is the reactivity in dollars. Thus; for p =
2 dollars, the burst width at half maximum is estimated to be 0.4 msec.

The reactors smaller than case #2 would have narrower bursts.

5. Discussion

*

Several interesting features are apparent from these results.

a) The reactors are all fast, i.e., from 25 to 40% of the total
integrated flux is gbove 100 kev, and essentially all of the flux is
above 1 kev.

b) The flux of neutrons above 100 kev ie quite insensitive to
reactor size, when the normalization is for a given maximum energy
density (e.q., I kwsec/cm?). This is so because the peak-to-average
power density ratio rises with increasing core size (see Table 1). The
total flux falls off fairly sharply with decreasing core size below
perhaps 30 in. diam. |

¢) A single nickel container shell, perhaps 6 in. thick, appears

to be a satisfactory reflector, yielding quite flat power distributions,

‘at least for the case studied. It is possible that some gains could be

realized by optimizing the container-reflector regions of the assembly.
d) Burst widths. While the burst widths have not been calculated

with great care, the results obtained for one of the largest cores

studied appear to confirm the expectation that the pulses of the desired

magnitude will be less than 1 msec in width.

ht Very little attention has so far been given to engineering aspects
of a practical burst reactor. The quenching mechanism, depending on
expansion of the liquid fuel, can be significantly affected by details
of the geometrical arrangement, such as the shape of the core (e.g.,
spherical or cylindricsl), and the location of the free liquid surface,
The range of temperatures that can be permitted may be extended
‘somewhat by pressurizing the cover gas, and in any event the core vessel
will have to be capable of withstanding substantial mechanical shocks.
A thick vessel will therefore probably be required.
Details of the control mechanisms, and in particular of the devices
for introducing reactivity very rapidly, will require considerable
thought. : Lo So

6. Summary

A first look at the possibility of using a molten-salt reactor to
a produce intense, sharp bursts of neutrons indicates that fluxes of
2-3 x 10%% neutrons/cm?® per burst can be achieved in a central test
. : cavity. This can be accomplished with a core perhaps 30 in. in outer
| diemeter, having a volume of about 200 liters, and with a burst yield
of about 700 Mw sec. The neutrons are essentially all above 1 kev, and
a third of the flux is above 100 kev. The estimated burst width is less

than 1 msec .

Appendix

One of the above reactors, operating in burst mode with a maximum
energy density of Lk Mw sec/liter, nay be compared with a similar reactor
‘operating at constant power with a maximum power density of 4 Mw/liter
and with a coolant. temperature rise, AT, equal to 1000°C times the
residence time of the fuel in the core, in seconds. The implication is
of course that a reactor like case #10, for example, at a power level of

600 Mw, would produce a total (fast) flux in the test cavity of 2 x 106
neutrons/cm®sec. e .

The power density of L Mw/liter is probably attainable. One is
led to speculate that such a reactor, with cooling adequate for 600-Mw
operation, could be operated in pulsed mode with a pulse repetition rate
of 1/sec. Since the pulses could then not be initiated from a very low
neutron level; it is doubtful that pulses as short as those cited above
could be achieved. We have not yet estimated what pulse shape might be
obtained at such e high repetition rate, but there appear to be some
interesting possibilities here worth further investigation: - )
