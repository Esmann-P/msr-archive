INTRODUCTION

Design and evaluation studies have been made of thermal molten-salt
breeder reactors (MSBR) in order to assess their economic and nuclear
potential and to identify the important design and development problems.
The reference reactor design presented here contains design problems -
related to molten-salt reactors in general.

The MSBR reference design concept is a two-region, two-fluid system,
with fuel salt separated from the blanket salt by graphite tubes. The
fuel salt consists of uranium fluoride dissolved in a mixture of lithium-
beryllium fluorides, while the blanket salt is a thorium-lithium fluoride
of eutectic composition (about 27 mole % thorium fluoride). The energy
generated in the reactor fluid is transferred to a secondary coolant-galt
circuit, which couples the reactor to a supercritical steam cycle. On-
site fluoride volatility processing is employed, leading to low unit
processing costs and economic operation as a thermal breeder reactor.

MSBR PLANT DESIGN
Flowsheet oo

Figure 1 gives the flowsheet of the 1000-Mw(e) MSBR power plant.
Fuel flows through the reactor at a rate of about 4h,000 gpm (velocity
of about 15 ft/sec), entering the core at 1000°F and leaving at 1300°F,
The primary fuel circuit has four loops, each loop having a pump and ea
primary heat exchanger. Each of these pumps has a capacity of about
11,000 gpm. The four blanket pumps and heat exchangers, although smaller,
are similar to corresponding components in the fuel system. The blanket

salt enters the reactor vessel at 1150°F and leaves at 1250°F. The

blanket salt pumps have a capacity of about 2000 gpm.

Four 14%,000-gpm coolant pumps circulste the sodium fluoroborate
coolant salt, which enters the shell side of the primary heat exchanger
at 850°F and leaves at 1112°F. After leaving the primary heat exchanger,
the coolant salt is further heated to 1125°F on the shell side of the
blanket heat exchangers. The coolant then circulates through the shell
side of 16 once-through superheaters (four superheaters per pump). In
addition, four 2000-gpm pumps circulate a portion of the coolant through
eight reheaters.

The steam system flowsheet, is italy that of the nev TVA Bull
Run plant, with modifications to increase the rating to 1000 Mw(e) and to
preheat the working fluid to TOO°F prior to entering the heat exchanger—

.superheater unit. A supercritical power conversion system is used, which

is appropriate for molten-salt application and takes advantage of the
high-strength structural alloy employed. Use of a supercritical fluid
system results in an overall plant thermal efficiency of about 45%.

Reactor Design

Figure 2 shows a plan view of the MSBR cell arrangement. The reactor
cell is surrounded by four shielded cells containing the superheaters and
reheater units; these cells can be individually isolated for maintenance.
The processing cell, located adjacent to the reactor, is divided into a
high-level and a low-level activity area.

~ Figure 3 shows an elevation view of the reactor and indicates the
position of equipment in the various cells. Figure 4, a plan view of
the reactor cell, shows the location of the reactor, pumps, and fuel and
blanket heat exchangers. Figure 5 is an elevation of the reactor cell.
The Hastelloy N reactor vessel has a side wall thickness of about 1-1/L-
in. and a head thickness of about 2-1/4 in.; it is designed to operate
at 1200°F and 150 psi. The plenum chambers, with 1/4-in.-thick walls,
communicate with the external heat exchangers by concentric inlet-outlet
piping. The inner pipe has slip joints to accommodate thermal expansion.
Bypass flow through these slip joints is about 1% of the total flow. As
indicated in Fig. 5, the heat exchangers are suspended from the top of
the cell and are located below the reactor. Each fuel pump has a free
fluid surface and a storage volume which permit rapid drainage of fuel
fluid from the core upon loss of flow. In addition, the fuel salt can
be drained to the dump tanks when the reactor is shut down for an extended
time. The entire reactor cell is kept at high temperature, while cold
"fingers" and thermal insulation surround structural support members and
all special equipment which must be kept at relatively low temperatures.
The control rod drives are located above the core, and the control rods
are inserted into the central region of the core.

The reactor vessel, about 14 ft in diameter by about 15 ft high,
contains a 1l0-ft-diam core assembly composed of reentry-type graphite
fuel cells. The graphite tubes are attached to the two plenum chambers
at the bottom of the reactor with graphite~-to-metal transition sleeves.
Fuel from the entrance plenum flows up fuel passages in the outer region
of the fuel cell and down through a single central passage to the exit
plenum. The fuel flows from the exit plenum to the heat exchangers,
then to the pump and back to the reactor. A 1-1/2-ft-thick molten-salt
blanket plus a 1/4-ft-thick graphite reflector surround the core. The
blanket salt also permeates the interstices of the core lattice so
fertile material flows through the core without mixing with the fissile
fuel salt,

The MSBR requires structural integrity of the graphite fuel cell.
In order to reduce the effect of radiation damage, the fuel cells have
been made small to reduce the fast flux gradient across the graphite
wall. Also, the cells are anchored only at one end to permit axial move-
ment. The core volume has been made large in order to reduce the flux
level in the core. In addition, the reactor is designed to permit re-
placement of the entire graphite core by remote means if required.

Figure 6 shows a cross section of a fuel cell. Fuel fluid flows
upward through the small passages and downward through the large central

a passage. The outside diameter of a fuel cell tube is 3.5 in.; there

are 534 of these tubes spaced on a 4.8-in. triangular pitch. The tube
assemblies are surrounded by hexagonal blocks of moderator graphite
with blanket salt filling the interstices. The nominal core composition
is T5% graphite, 1 18% fuel salt, and Th blanket salt by volume.

A summary of parameter values chosen for the. 'MSER design is given
in Table 1.

Fuel Processing

The primary objectives of fuel processing are to purify and recycle
fissile and carrier components, and minimize fissile inventory while
‘holding losses to a low value. The fluoride volatility-vacuum distilla-
tion process fulfills these objectives through simple operations.

The core fuel is conveniently processed by fluoride volatility and
vacuum distillation. Blanket processing is accomplished by fluoride
volatility alone, and the processing cycle time is short enough to main-
tain a very low concentration of fissile material. The effluent UFg is
absorbed by fuel salt and reduced to UF4 by treatment with hydrogen to
reconstitute a fuel-salt mixture of the desired composition.

Molten-salt reactors are inherently suited to the design of pro-

. cessing facilities integral with the reactor plant; these facilities

require only a small amount of cell space adjacent to the reactor cell.

» Because all services and equipment available to the reactor are available
to the processing plant and shipping and storage charges are eliminated,
integral processing facilities permit significant savings in capital and
operating costs. Also, the processing plent inventory of fissile material
is greatly reduced, resulting in low fuel inventory charges and improved
fuel utilization characteristics for the reactor,

The principal steps in core and blanket stream processing of the
MSBR are shown in Fig. 7. A small side stream of each fluid is continu-
ously withdrawn “from the fuel and blanket circulating loops and circulated
through the processing system. After processing, the decontaminated
fluids are returned to the reactor at some convenient point--for example,
via the fuel and fertile stream storage tanks.

‘attached to fixed tube sheets. The fuel salt flows downward in the outer

section of tubes, enters a plenum at the bottom of the exchanger, and
then flows upward to the pump through the center section of tubes. Enter-
ing at the top, the coolant salt flows on the baffled shell-side of the
exchanger down the central core, under the barrier that separates the two
sections, ‘and up the outer annular section.

. Since a large temperature difference exists in ‘the two tube sections,
the tube sheets at the bottom of the exchanger are not attached to the

‘shell, The design permits differential tube growth between the two sec-

tions without creating troublesome stress problems. To accomplish this,

"the tube sheets are connected at ‘the bottom of the exchanger by a bellows-

type Joint. This arrangement, essentially a floating plenum, permits

"enough relative motion between the central and outer tube sheets to com-

pensate for difference in tube growth without creating intolerable stresses
in either the joint, the tubes, or in the pump.

The blanket heat exchangers increase “the temperature of the coolant
leaving the primary core heat exchangers. Since the coolant-salt tempera-
ture rise through the blanket exchangers is small and the flow rate is

. relatively high, the exchangers are designed for a single shell-side pass

for the coolant salt, although two-pass flow is retained for the blanket
salt in the tubes. Brraigt tubes with two tube sheets are used.

The superheater is a U-tube, U-shell exchanger using disc and dough-

ti baffles with varying spacing. It is a long, slender exchanger having

relatively large baffle spacing. The baffle spacing is established by the
shell-side pressure drop and by the temperature gradient across the tube
wall, and is greatest in the central portion of the exchanger where the
temperature difference between the fluids is high. The supercritical
fluid enters the tube side of the superheater at TOO°F and 3800 psi and
leaves at 1000°F and 3600 psi.

The reheaters transfer energy from the coolant salt to the working
fluid before its use in the intermediate pressure turbine. A shell-tube
exchanger is used, producing steam at 1000°F and 540 psi.

. Since the freezing temperature of the secondary salt coolant is about
TOO°F, a high working fluid inlet temperature is required. Preheaters,

It along with prime fluid, are used in raising the temperature of the working
. fluid entering the superheaters. Prime fluid goes through a preheater

exchanger and leaves at a pressure of 3550 psi and about 8T0°F. It is

. then injected into the feedwater in a mixing tee, producing fluid at

TOO°F and 3500 psi. The pressure is then increased to about 3800 psi by
a pressurizer (feedwatér pump) before the fluid enters the superheater.

- CAPITAL COST ESTIMATES

 

Reactor Pover Plant

" Preliminary estimates of the’ capital cost of a 1000-Mw(e) molten-
salt breeder reactor power station indicate a direct construction cost
of about $80.4 million. After supplying the indirect cost factors used
in the advanced converter evaluation,! an estimated total plant cost of
$113.6 million is obtained. A summary of plant costs is given in Table
2. The conceptual design was not sufficiently detailed to permit a com-
pletely reliable estimate; however, the design and estimates were studied
thoroughly enough to make meaningful comparisons with previous converter

reactor plant cost studies. The relatively low capital cost estimate

obtained results from the small physical size of the MSBR and the simple
control requirements. The results of the study encourage the belief
that the cost of an MSBR power station will be as low as for stations
utilizing other reactor concepts,

The operating and maintenance costs of the MSBR were not estimated.

Based on the ground rules used in reference 1, these costs would be

about 0. 3 wii1l/kwbr(e)..

Fuel Recycle Plant

The capital costs associated with fuel recycle equipment were obtained
by itemizing and costing the major process equipment required, and esti-
mating the costs of site, bulldings, instrumentation, waste disposal, and
building services associated with Fuel ‘recycle.

Table 3 summarizes the direct construction costs, “the indirect costs,
and total costs associated with the ‘integrated processing facility having
approximately the ‘required capacity.

The operating and maintenance costs for the fuel recycle facility
include labor, lsbor overhead, chemicals, utilities, and maintenance
materials. The total annual cost for the capacity considered here (15
£12 of fuel salt per day and 105 £13 of fertile salt per day) is egtl-
mated to be $721,230, which is equivalent to about 0.1 mill/kvhr(e).®

Analysis Procedures

Calculation Method. The calculations were performed with OPTIMERC,
a combination of an optimization code with the MERC multigroup, diffusion,
equilibrium reactor code. MERC® calculates the nuclear performance, the
equilibrium concentrations of the various nuclides, including fission
products, and the fuel cycle cost for a given set of conditions, OPTI-
MERC permits up to twenty reactor parameters to be varied, within limits,
in order to determine an optimum, by the method of steepest ascent. The
designs were optimized essentially for minimum fuel cycle cost, with
lesser weight given to maximizing the annual fuel yield. Typical param-
eters varied were the reactor dimensions, blanket thickness, fractions
of fuel and fertile salts in the core, and fuel and fertile stream pro-
cessing rates.

Several equations were included in the code for approximating cer-
tain capital and operating costs that vary with the design parameters
(for example, capital cost of the reactor vessel, which varies with the
reactor dimensions). These costs were automatically added to the fuel
cycle cost in the optimization routine so that the optimization search
would take into account all known economic factors. However, only the

fuel cycle cost itself is reported in the results.

  

Modified GAM-1 — THERMOS cross-section Litraries were . used to com-
pute the broad group cross sections for these calculations. It was
assumed that all nuclides in the reactor system are at their equilibrium
‘concentrations. To check this assumption, a typical reactor design was
examined to determine the operating time required for the various uranium
isotopes to approach their equilibrium concentrations from a startup with
235y, It was found that 2337 and #%5U were within 95% of their equilib-
rium concentrations in less than two years. ‘Uranium-23k was within 95%
of equilibrium after eight years, while 236y was within 80% after 10
years. Since the breeding performance depends mainly on the ratio of
2337 to 2°5U in the fuel, the equilbrium calculation appears to be a
good representation of the lifetime performance of these reactors, even
for startup on 2357,

 

 

to some fractional power called the scale factor.

Processing. The processing scheme is that indicated in Fig. T.
A fissile material loss of 0.1% per pass through processing was assumed.
In addition to the basic processing scheme employed, results were
also obtained for the case that Pa can he removed directly from the
blanket stream. The improvement in performance under these circumstances
is a measure of the incentive to develop Pa removal ability.

. Fission Product Behavior. The ‘disposition of the various fission
products was assumed as shown in Table 6. The behavior of ®5Xe and
other fission gases has a significant influence on nuclear performance.

 

A gas- -stripping system is provided to remove these gases from the fuel
salt. However, part of the xenon could diffuse into the moderator
graphite. In the calculations reported here, a 135%e poison fraction

 

of 0.005 was assumed.

Nuclear Design Analysis

 

The important parameters describing the MSBR design are given in
Table 1. Many of the parameters were basically fixed by the ground rules
for the evaluation or by the engineering design. These include the therm-
al efficiency, plant factor, capital charge rate, maximum fuel velocity,
size of fuel tubes, processing costs and fissile loss rate, and the out-
of -core fuel inventory. The parameters which were optimized by OPTIMERC
were the reactor dimensions, power density, the core composition includ-
ing the c/u and Th/U ratios, and the processing rates.

Nuclear Performance. The results of the ‘calculations for the MSER
design are given in Table T, and tHe néutron balance in Table 8. The
basic design has the inherent advantage of no neutron losses to struc-
tural ‘materials other than the moderator, “Excépt for some unavoidable
loss of delayed neutrons in the external fuel circuit, there is almost

2€Y0 neutron leakage from the reactor because of the thick blanket.

Fuel Cycle Cost. The components of the fuel cycle cost for the MSER
are given in Table 9. The main components are the fissile inventory and
processing costs. The inventory costs are rather rigid for a given reac-
tor design, since they are largely determined by the assumed external
fuel volume. The processing costs are, of course, a function of the pro-
cessing cycle times, one of the chief parameters optimized in this study.
