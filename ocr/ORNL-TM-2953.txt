-A NEW APPROACH TO THE DESIGN OF STEAM GENERATORS
FOR MOLTEN SALT REACTOR POWER PLANTS

A. P. Fraas

ABSTRACT

A new type of steam generator has been devised to meet
‘the special requirements of high-temperature liquid metal and
molten salt reactor systems, The basic design concept is such
that boiling heat transfer instabilities and their attendant
severe thermal stresses are avoided even for a temperature -
difference of as much as 1000°F between the feedwater and the
high-temperature liquid, thus giving good control characteris-
tics even under startup conditions. This is accomplished by
employing a vertical reentry tube geometry with the feedwater
entering the bottom of the inner small diameter tube (~/4 in,
diam) through which it flows upward until evaporated to dry-
‘ness. The slightly superheated steam emerging from the top
of the small central tube then flows back downward through the
annulus between the central tube and the outer tube. A por-
tion of the heat transferred from the high-temperature liquid
to the superheated steam in the annulus is in turn transferred
to the water boiling in the central tube. Design studies in-
dicate that this type of boiler not only avoids thermal stress
and salt freezing problems but it also gives a relatively com-
pact and inexpensive construction. Further, it appears to make
possible a simple plant control system with exceptionally good
plant response to changes in load demand.

 

~ INTRODUCTION

It has heen apparent since early in the molten salt reactor develop-
ment work that the high melting point of the fluoride salt suitable as
fuel for molten salt reactors coupled with the thermal stress problems
inherent in high-temperature liquid systems pose some exceedingly diffi-
cult problems in the design of steam generators.} These are compounded

by the complexities of two-phase flow and heat transfer problems under

‘boiling conditions, possible difficulties with boiling flow instabilities,

and the problems of obtaining good boiler operating characteristics for
 

 

a wide range of both full power design steam temperatures and pressures
and under the much reduced pressure and temperature conditions inherent
in startup and part load operation... Many different attempts to design
boilers for molten salt reactor systems have been made,!™® but each of
the approaches proposed has had some serious disadvantages. The startup
and part load control problems in particular have been so formidable, in
fact, that no attempt has been made to solve them for many of the designs
that have been proposed — only full load: design conditions have been con-
sidered. It is ‘beliéved that the new reentry tube concept proposed in

this report will yield: compact, economical boilers that can be designed
| for any full power design steam conditions and yet will give good stability
and control characteristics over : the full range from zero power to full
power conditions, and further will not present difficult thermal stress or
salt freezing ‘problems. iN

© A draft of this report substantielly as it now stands was prepared
and distributed July 15, 1968 to key people in the molten salt reactor
project at ORNL. . They kindly reviewed the draft. and’ suggested a number
of additions to help clarify this new approach. By far the most serious
reservations they had were concerned with boiling flow stability at low
loads. This required some sort of a test, and the report was held pend-
ing the availability of funds for a projected test rig. Because of lack
of funds this rig has hot yet been built.

It happened that basically similar requirements for a steam generator
arose last year in a program to develop a small isotope power unit. These
requirements made it important to test a low steam pressure, short tube
version of the reentry boiler. The results of the tests are now in, and
good performance was obtained.” Even though these results cover a limited
range and the steam generator proportions are substantially different from
" those proposed here for a large central station, the basic concept. appears
to be validated for the low load portion of the operating regime that was
most open to question. -As a consequence, it was decided that the report
should be issued.

REVIEW OF BOILER DESIGNS PROPOSED FOR
MOLTEN SALT REACTOR SYSTEMS

The various boilers that have been considered for use with molten
salt reactors might be grouped in the categories outlined in Table 1.
The principel features and major advanteges and disadvantages of each
are summarized very briefly to help point up the problems and provide a
framework for the subsequent analysis of the heat transfer, thermal

stress, and control problems.
Conventional Shell-and-Tube Heat Exchangers

A logical first candidate is a shell-and-tube heat exchanger with
the salt inside the tubes and the water boiling outside of the tubes.
Two configurations are included in Table 1. - The horizontal U-shaped tube
and casing geometry employed for the early pressurized water reactors
(see Ref. 8, p. 197) has the advantage that not only is differential ther-
mal expansion between the tubes and the casing readily accommodated with-
out producing serious thermal stresses, but the difference between the hot

fluid inlet and outlet temperatures will not induce severe stresses in the

header sheet as would be the case for a simple shell-and-tube heat ex-

changer with a U-tube configuration. The major difficulty with this con-

~ ventional U-shaped casing design is that the temperature difference be-

tween the water and the walls of the tubes carrying the molten salt is

far greater than the temperature difference in the nucleate boilihg regime
so that an unstable vapor blanket would form ‘between the liquid end the
hot metal surface ‘(see Fig. 1). This leeds to unstable, noisy operation

and severe thermal stresses in the tubes as a consequence of violent ir-

regularities in the heat transfer coefficient.

Supercritical Pressure Units

It has been suggested that these difficulties might be reduced
through the use of a supercritical water system inasmuch as this would

reduce the temperature difference between the feedwater and the molten

salt, reduce the fraction of heat added at low water temperatures, and
reduce the sharp changes in physical properties associated with the phase
change from liquid to vapor.2°® In units of this type it is usually con-
sidered best to have the molten salt outside the tubes and the super-
critical water and steam flowing inside the tubes. However, while there
is no sharp phase change, the very rapid changes in density and other
physical properties near the critical temperature under supercritical
pressure conditions lead to marked changes in the heat. transfer perform-
ance and abrupt reductions in the heat transfer coefficient something like
those associated with the burnout heat flux encountered at subcritical
pressures.® In addition to these flow and heat transfer phenomena and

the boiling flow instabilities that would be associated with them, there
would be large, irregularly fluctuating thermal stresses in the tube wall
in the region near the feedwater inlet of the boiler unit, and these would
be likely to cause tube cracking and failure. These problems are dis-
cussed later in some detail.

- Although the use of & supercritical pressure system reduces the
severity of the boiling flow stability problem for operation near the de-
sign point,’ a great deal of difficulty has been encountered in all of the
coal-fired once-through and supercritical pressure boilers in going from
zero power to part load conditions of at least 10%, and often to as high
as 30% power. These difficulties stem in part from the large density
change as the water-steam mixture flows through the boilers and in part
from the reduced pressure drop at the lower flows which reduces the damp-

ing of the oscillations by turbulence losses.8

Double-Walled Tubes with a Heat Dam

M. E. Lackey suggested in 1958 that one means for. reducing the tem-
perature difference between the tube wall and the water to avoid film
boiling conditions would be to incorporate a heat dam in the form of a
sintered powder matrix between an inner tube carrying the molten salt and
the outer tube in contact with the boiling water.* This approach would

be quite effective at full power where the average heat flux would be

high, but would present problems under startup and low power conditions
because a high heat flux is inherently associated with a large tempera-
ture drop through such a heat dam. 'A further disadvantage is that dif-
ferential thermal expansion between the inner and outer tube walls would
induce severe thermal stresses in the sintered buffer material, and these
would lead to cracking of the sintered matrix and unpredictable increases
in the thermal resistance.? |
‘The cracking problem in the sintered material could be avoided by

using instead an air space &s a heat dam. The OD of the inner tube could

_ be knurled, for example, and the outer tube swaged down onto it. This

would have the disadvantage that differential thermal expansion between
the inner and outer tubes would probably loosen the swaged joint and give
an indeterminately large =~ probably excessively large = thermal barrier
at full load. If this did not happen, thermal stresses would probably.

~ cause cracking of the tubes.

Flash Boiler

In an effort to avoid the difficulties outlined above, a flash boiler
was proposed in 1955.) In a unit of this type the molten salt would flow
outside of the tubes and feedwater would be injected in the form of a long
thin plume of fine spray directed along the axis of the boiler tube.

- Experience in the development of nozzles for diesel engines indicates that
-a high penetration spray could be obtained with sharp-edged, single-

orifice nozzles having a hole diameter of about 0.020 in.,1° and that
nozzles of this type would break the liquid up into droplets having a

_ diameter of the order of 0.005 in.ll These droplets would form a long

slender spray plume that would extend for perhaps 2 ft down the bore of
a 1/2 in. tube. ‘Droplets would impinge on the tube wall at a very low

.angle of incidence, and would tend to skitter along the wall riding on
‘a thin film of vapor. - Analyses indicated that the local thermal stresses

associated with the cold tracks left by droplets of this sort would be
well within the elastic limit and should not give difficulties with

thermal stresses.l

.
 

A brief series of tests to investigate this concept was run by an
MIT practice school group.!? These tests showed that there was a strong
tendency for a large fraction of the droplets to impinge on the tube wall
in the region close to the injection nozzle, and that this 1ed to such a
pronounced cooling effect that a frozen film of molten salt tended to form
on the outside of the tube in that region, 12 The tests had been initiated
on the premise that they offered an attractive way to provide for emer-
‘gency cooling of the ART fuel dump tanks; hence the test work was termi-
nated with the demise of the ANP program. No further work on the concept
was carried out because it inherently requires a very large number of tubes
of rather short length so that the tube-to-header joint costs tend to be-
come excessive. Further, the concept does not appear to lend itself well

to high pressure and supercritical pressure steam systeas.

Loeffler Boiler

The Loeffler boiler concept used in a few coal-fired steam plants
has been considered.® Systems of this sort have been built and operated
for coal-fired furnaces. Operation apparently has been satisfactory ex-
cept for the extremely high noise level associated with the boiler and
difficulties with the steam pumps required. The Loeffler concept entails
admission of. saturated steam to a heat transfer matrix heated by molten
salt. The superheated steam leaving this matrix would be divided into
two portions, one of which would flow to the turbine and the other would
be returned to a boiler drum where it would bubble through the water in
~ the drum. This approach has the disadvantages that it requires large
and expensive boiler drums, implosion of the vapor bubbles in the boiler
drum makes operation extremely noisy and induces violent vibration ex-
citing forces, the relatively poor steam-side heat transfer coefficient
-and low enthalpy rise lead to a large number of tube-to-header joints,
and steam pumps posing tough design and reliability problems are required
to recirculate steam through the boiler. On the other hand, the system
has the advantage that it lends itself readily to startup and part load
operations, it virtually eliminates the possibility of salt freezing as

a consequence of excessive cooling in the steam generator, and it greatly
eases the thermal stress problems by substituting a salt-to-steam heat ex-

changer for the salt-to-water boiler.

Triple Tube Boiler

When the writer solicited criticisms and suggestions on the proposed
new boiler concept, M. E. Iackey pointed out that B. Kinyon and G. D.
Whitman had proposed a somewhat similar boiler in 1960, (Ref. 6), and
S. E. Beall pointed out that a variation of this approach had been tested

as a means for cooling fuel dump tanks.1? The arrangement proposed by

Kinyon employed three concentric tubes with boiling water flowing upward

through the inner annulus to a vapor separator and superheated steam flow-

ing down through the outer annulus. The central passage would serve to
return the water from the vapor separator to a boiler water recirculating
pump. This arrangement has the advantage that the superheated vapor in
the annulus between the outer tube heated by the molten salt and the tube

. containing the boiling water would act as a buffer both to eliminate ser-

ious thermal stresses and to avoid excessive metal temperatures adjacent

to the boiling water. The arrangement has the disadvantage that it re-
quires a fairly large tube diameter and hence a fairly large ‘tube wall
thickness for supercritical water systems. Thus, the amount of heat trans-
fer surface area required tends to be large because the principal barrier
to heat transfer lies in heat conduction through thick tube walls. Fur-

“ther, the arrangement requires the development of a vapor separator that

would fit within a small diameter, preferably that of the tube. Experience
in vapor separator development indicates that the velocities. required for
good vapor-liquid separation: are much lower than those one would like to
use in the tube for heat transfer purposes, and hence a rather bulky pro-
tuberance would have to be employed at the end of each tube; this appears

to lead to a set of extremely awkward mechanical design problems.
 

10

Reentry Tube Boiler

The boiler proposed in this report is somewhat similar to the one
described above but differs in that it makes use of only two vertical,
concentric tubes in the form shown in Fig. 2. The water enters at the
bottom through a central tube having a diameter of about 1/h in. Pre-
heating and boiling occur as the’ water rises in “this tube until evapora-
tion is complete, after which there is some superheating. The steam
emerges from the top end of the small diemeter tube, reverses direction,
and flows back downward through an annulus’ between the inner “small tube
and an outer tube having an ID of ‘around 1/2 in. The molten salt enters
at the bottom, flows upward around the outer ‘tube, and out the top. With
this arrangement there is only one header sheet separating the molten salt
from the atmosphere, and this header sheet is not subject to a large pres-
sure differential. Thermal sleeves would be used at the header sheet to
minimize thermal stresses (see Fig. 3). There would be no high pressure
header sheets in this system; the tubes for the high pressure feedwater
and the exit steam would be manifolded as in high pressure coal-fired
boilers rather than run into header sheets. The steam annulus between
the inner and outer tubes would act as a buffer to isolate the relatively:
low-temperature boiling water region from the high- temperatire molten salt.

This isolation would be so effective ‘that it would be quite possible to
| heat the unit to the molten salt operating temperature with no water in
the system and then slowly add water to initiate boiling. As will be
shown later, it should be possible to design the unit so that it would
operate stably over a wide range of" conditions from zero load to overload
with no difficulties from thermal ‘stresses or freezing of the salt.

It might at first appear that the extra heat ‘transfer films through
which heat must be transmitted from the molten salt to the boiling water
might lead to a large increase in surface area requirements and hence in
the size, weight, and cost of the unit. However, it appears quite pos-
sible to design so that these disadvantages are more than offset by such
features as the absence of a high-pressure header sheet and the ability
to operate with high-temperature differences between the molten salt and

the boiling water so that the overall size, weight, and cost of the unit

DESIGN FOR GOOD STABILITY AND CONTROL CHARACTERISTICS

The usual procedure in developing a design for a steam generator has
been to choose a geometry, establish the proportions for full power condi-
tions, and then — sometimes — examine the full range of control problems.
The inverse order seems at least equally logical and is followed here. The
writer has felt from the beginning that some of the most difficult condi-
tions to be met are those associated with initial startup and part load op-
eration. Thus, the first step in the evaluation work was to establish a
typical set of molten salt and steam temperatures, and from these, using
basic heat balance considerations, deduce the ‘effects of different modes
of control for the various load conditions of interest. This approach gives

a valuable insight into the full range of the over-all design problems.

‘Molten Salt Temperatures at Part Load

Several different approaches can be taken to the control of a molten
salt reactor steam power plant. Perhaps the simplest and most reliable ap-
proach is to make use of constant speed ac motors to drive pumps in both
the fuel circuit. and the intermediate salt circuit. If this is done, the

temperature rise in each salt circuit will be directly proportional to the

load so that the circuits will ‘be isothermal at zero power. The basic heat

transfer relations are such. that ‘the temperature difference between the two

‘salt circuits will also be directly proportional to the load and will drop

to zero at zero load. If there is no control rod movement in the reactor,
the zero load reactor temperature will be the mean of the inlet and outlet

fuel temperatures at full load. - These effects are shown in Fig. 4a for op-

| eration with constant speed fuel and inert salt pumps. Note that both the

minimum and the mean temperatures of the inert salt rise as the load is
reduced — an undesirable characteristic from the standpoint of the design

of most steam generators. This situation can be changed by holding the

reactor inlet temperature constant in which case the temperatures in the
fuel and inert salt circuits would be defined by the curves in Fig. 4b.
The fuel inlet temperature ought not be reduced below the value shown be-
cause it is desirable to maintain the fuel at least 100°F above its freez-
ing point. Other effects could be obtained by varying the speeds of the
fuel and/or inert salt pumps, but the resulting complications — particu-
larly at or near zero load - are quite objectionable.

After analyzing a variety of power plant control modes it was decided
that the simplest system would be the most reliable and should be used for

- the bulk of this study. The approach chosen is believed to be the simplest

possible, i.e., it assumes a constant mean fuel temperature end constant
speed pumps for both the fuel and the inert salt irrespective of load.

Effects of Mode of Control on Steam
Temperatures at Part Load

The inherent effects of typical control modes on the temperature dis-
tributions that will result as a consequence of fundamental heat balance
considerations are shown in Figs. 5, 6, and 7 for the full range of load
conditions. It can be seen from examination of these curves that the steam
outlet temperature will rise as the load is reduced because the temperature
difference between the two fluid streams in a heat exchanger drops off with
a reduction in the heat flux, This problem arises in the control of any
steam plant that is coupled to a high-temperature reactor whose mean tem-
perature is held constant.14 To avoid demage to the turbine, the steam
temperature could be reduced at part load by introduction of a desuper-
heater between the steam generator and the turbine. The available desuper-
heater units may not be well suited to this particular application, but
the design of a suitable unit would be straightforward. However, it is
apparent that high steam temperatures under part load conditions would ser-
iously increase the creep stress problem in the steam system if it were
to operate with a constant boiler discharge pressure, The problem could
be eased by scheduling the reactor mean temperature so that it would in-
crease with power output. One way of doing this would be to maintain the

reactor inlet temperature constant and allow the temperature rise in the

fuel salt to increase in direct proportion to the load. If this were done,
the temperatures in the inert salt and steam circuits would vary with load
as indicated in Fig. 4b. This control schedule for the salt circuits was
assumed in preparing a few of the boiler performance estimates presented
later in this report to show that this arrangement might reduce or elimin-
ate the need for desuperheating the steam under part load conditions at
the expense of complicating the reactor control problems.

The curves of Figs. 5 and 6 were calculated on the basis that the
boiler would be operated in the conventional fashion with a constant steam
discharge pressure of 4000 psi, and the pressure of the steam supplied to
the turbine would be reduced by a throttling valve. However, there are a
number of advantages associated with operating a steam boiler-turbine-
condenser-feed pump system with no throttle valve between the boiler and
the turbine so that the steam pressure is determined by the flow rate
through the critical pressure drop orifice represented by the inlet nozzle
box of the first stage of the turbine. One of the more important. of these
advantages in this instance is that, if the steam system were designed so
that the boiler discharge pressure would be directly proportional to the

load, the higher boiler temperatures would be associated with lower pres-

sures, and the creep stresses in the boiler tube wall would not be exces-

sive. If this were done, to a first approximation the boiler pressure will

be directly proportional to the load, and curves for the steam temperature

- ag a function of the amount of heat added on the water side will be as in-

dicated in Fig. 7 for a typlcal case. Not surprisingly, calculations pre-

“sented later in the report show that the tube- length to evaporate to dry-

ness is much the same irrespective .of the boiler pressure at a given load.
However, the pressure drop through the boiler under part load conditions
is much higher if the pressure is directly proportional to the load than
if the boiler were operated at a constant pressure. = Increasing the pres-
sure drop at part load is advantageous in that it will much improve the
boiling flow stability.

 

Heat Transfer Instabilities and Thermal Stresses

One can sense intuitively that severe thermal stresses might be induced

by the wide variations in the heat flux — and hence the transfer coefficient
 

 

20

that can occur with changes in the difference in temperature between the:
metal wall and the saturation temperature of a boiling liquid (see Fig. 1).
However, it is not obvious just how these thermal stresses may be related
to fluctuations in the boiling heat transfer coefficient, how large they
may be, or why they may be more severe at low loads than at the design
point, and M. Rosenthal asked that this short: section be. added to clerify
the problem, particularly for a unit designed for supercritical operation.
It should be noted that for some time it was thought that.this problem
could be avoided by going to supercritical water pressures, but severe
cracking of tubes in coal-fired supercritical boilers showed that, un-
fortunately, this is not the case.? Detailed investigations of -boiling
heat transfer relations in the supercritical pressure regime have shown
that large variations in heat transfer coefficient still occur, particularly
at high heat fluxes, i.e., if there is a large temperature difference be-
tween the metal wall and the bulk -free stream® (see Fig. 8).

To illustrate the problem, consider a short section of INOR-8 tubing
with supercritical pressure water at 690°F inside end molten salt at 1150°F
flowing outside the tube with a salt heat transfer coefficient of 1000

Btu/hr-£t3-°F. The thermal conductivity of the wall is about 12 Btu/hr-ft:-°F.

The thickness is 0.10 in., and hence the conductance of the wall would be
about 1440 Btu/hr-ft?-°F, and thus the temperature drop through the tube
wall would be about 70% that through the salt film on the outer wall. Two
very different operating regimes are possible. : Assuming that the curves of
Fig. 8 define the heat transfer situation on the water side, the heat flux
“where the water-steam enthalpy ran 780 Btu/lb could be ~100,000 Btu/hr or
at a nearby point downstream where ‘the enthalpy reached 900 Btu/1b it could
be 150,000 Btu/hr. The resulting film and wall temperatures and tempera-
ture drops cen be summarized in Table 2.

Changing the radial AT through the tube wall from 70°F to 105°F at
power, and to O°F at no load would lead to differential thermal expansion
between the inner and outer surfaces and hence to both circumferential and
axial stresses that would be superimposed on the basic pressure stresses.
Power cycling and changes from one heat transfer regime to the other would
cause thermal strain cycling, and this could eventually lead to cracking

.and failure. The problem would be much worse at subcritical pressures

where the change in heat transfer coefficient with enthalpy is both larger
and more abrupt (see Fig. 9). The problem could be eased somewhat by re-
ducing the molten salt temperature to 1000°F for startup and low power
conditions, but it would not be eliminated.

Observations of tubes transferring heat to water at supercritical
pressures have shown that both of the regimes of Table 2 will be present,
i.e., some sections of the tube will operate at a lower wall temperature
and a high heat flux while others will operate at a higher temperature and
a lower heat flux. Further, these regimes tend to shift back and forth
axially along the tube with changes in water flow rate. This leads to
another type of thermal stress. Dilation of the hot region relative to
the cooler region leads to bending stresses in the tube wall, and these
stresses are likely to be severe because the shift from one heat transfer
regime to the other tends to be abrupt and the transition zone is short.
These stresses are analagous to those in thermal sleeves, and can be cal-
culated in the same way (see Ref. 8, p. 125). Unfortunately, data for
typical axial temperature distributions are not at hand to provide a good
basis for estimating the magnitude of these stresses.

At first thought it would appear that at light loads the above prob-
lems would be eased because the average heat flux would be greatly reduced.

However, this is not the case, The bulk of the heat transfer occurs at
the water inlet end because the temperature difference there is inherently
high irrespective of load, and it is the high-temperature difference that
gives the possibility of two drastically different temperature regimes.
Thus reducing the heat load simply reduces the length of the region in
which severe thermal stresses may be induced — it does not eliminate the
problem, In fact, if the pressure is reduced, the boiling point of the
water will drop and the temperature difference that can be induced in the
tube wall will be increased.

The above effects are complex and, in many respects, rather subtle,
but they are the reason for turning from the conventional shell-and-tube
heat exchanger geometry to the reentry tube construction proposed in this
report.

Flow Stability Considerations

In a conventional coal-fired boiler the pressure drop in the boiling

region is rather low in recirculating boilers, but the overall pressure

‘drop is fairly high because the pressure drop through the superheafer is

substantial. In once-through boilers, particularly in supercritical pres-
sure steam plants, the boiler pressure drop is large, commonly 20% of the
boiler inlet pressure. This stems in part from efforts to get a high heat
transfer coefficient on the steam side, in part from the long tubes made
necessary by the relatively low average heat transfer coefficient on the
combustion gas side, and in part by stringent orificing at the tube inlets
to assure a flow distribution across the tube bank such that it will be
possible to avoid burnout in regions where the local heat flux may be high
as a consequence of irregularities in the hot gas flow on the combustion
gas side of the boiler. These irregularities in the local hot gas tempera-
ture and heat flux vary substantially with the heat load on the boiler,
the fuel used, and the peculiarities and irregularities in the gas turbu-

‘lence pattern in the combustion zone. ' Fortunately, in a molten salt-heated

boiler not only can the tube wall never exceed the temperature of the
molten salt so that severe overheating of the tube wall is not a, problem,

but the molten salt temperature and flow distribution can be predicted

OC

25

within quite close limits instead of being subject to the vagaries in the
large-scale turbulence that are characteristic of combustion zones in fur-
naces. As a consequence, a steam generator for a molten salt reactor can

be designed to give a much higher average heat flux and yet a lower peak

“heat flux than can be obtained in a conventional coal-fired boiler. This

directly reduces the tube length and hence the pressure drop. In addition,

-1t reduces the need for orificing to control the water flow distribution

through the boiler. As a consequence, it is believed that it will be pos-

sible to design for lower water pressure drops through steam generators for

molten salt reactors than are ordinarily required for coal-fired boilers.
This will reduce both the power requirements for the boiler feed pump and
the tube wall thickness required for the feedwater piping.

Heat Transfer Analysis

Estimating the heat transfer performance of the reentry tube steam
generator involves a set of implicit relations that make an explicit solu-
tion out of the question and even an iterative solution surprisingly tricky.
This stems from the wide variety of combinations of conditions that may

occur in the boiler depending on the steam pressure, temperature, and flow

‘rate. The problems have much in common with, but are more difficult than,

those of steam generators for high-temperature gas-cooled reactors.l% The

steam conditions were chosen to be essentially the same as those of Eddy-
stone Unit No. 2, which was used as the basis for an earlier study, 15 The

feedwater temperature and flow rate, the exit steam pressure, and the mol-

- ten salt inlet and outlet temperatures are ordinarily given. From these

data it is possible to estimate a steam outlet temperature and from heat

balance considerations draw a set of curves such as those of Fig. 5 which
show the temperatures of the molten salt and the steam as functions of the
fraction of heat added to the steam in the course of its transit through

the boiler. Figure 7 shows a similar set of curves for a series of lower

pressures and lower loads; in this instance the pressure was taken as di-

‘rectly proportional to the load, a good approximation to the natural charac-

teristics of a steam boiler-turbine-condenser-feed pump system in which no

throttle valve is employed. Figures 5 and 7 illustrate one of the
 

 

26

difficulties in setting up an iterative calculation. Whereas the steam
temperature for the supercritical condition of Fig. 5 is uniquely defined
as a function of the fraction of heat added to the steam, this is not the
case for subcritical steam pressure conditions where the steam temperature
is essentially independent of the amount of heat added over a wide range
of heat addition. In attempting an iterative solution one can calculate
stepwise upward from the bottom of the tube using as his points of depar-
ture the given feedwater inlet conditions and the assumed steam outlet con-
ditions. The stepwise calculations can be continued. to a point at the top
of the inner tube where evaporation would be completed or the steam super-
-heated somewhat. = It is also possible to assume a set of steam conditions
at the outlet of the inner tube and mske stepwise calculations from the
top downward to the feedwater inlet end accepting the superheater outlet
temperature that results. The difference in the character of the relations
between the various load conditions of Figs. 5 and 7 lead to some conver-
gence problems in either case. These, in turn, make it necessary to modify
the calculational procedure somewhat depending on the steam conditions.
Both methods have been used in this study, end both have been found to be
not only awkward but demanding in that they require good engineering Jjudg-
"ment to choose values that will yield convergence. However, no better ap-
proach has been found in spite of some months of effort by both MIT gradu-
ate students who became interested in the problem and by the authors of
Ref, 7.

Typical Calculations

The steps followed in estimating the boiler tube length, temperature
distribution, and pressure drop on the water side are summarized in Table 3,
and a set of typical calculations is shown in Table 4. The first set of
calculations was made for the 100% load condition. The first step in the
calculations was to start at the bottom, or salt inlet end, and assume a
decrement in the enthalpy of the salt. This was chosen to be 10% or the
expected value for the boiler. For a given tube geometry the surface areas
of the inner and outer tube walls per unit of length are defined and

hence the area per increment of length is readily calculated. For good

Plot curves for the salt and steam temperatures as functions of M/qQ
from the inlet to the outlet (e.g., Fig. 7).

Specify the tube diameters and wall thicknesses.

Compute the overall heat transfer coefficients for the inner and
outer tube walls (e.g., use Fig. 11).

For convergence in the iteration, the heat transferred from the salt
to the annulus steam near the superheater outlet must be greater than
the heat transferred from the annulus steam to the water in the cen-
ter tube per unit of length, i.e., ViAjAt)/ISUsAxAt,/L. This will
probably require an inner tube liner to provide a heat dam near the
bottom. To minimize the overall tube length, this liner should be
terminated as soon as this can be done and still maintain

Estimate the mean temperature of the. salt, annulus steam, and boiler
water for the first increment of tube length using the ratio of the
heat added to the steam in the outer annulus to the total heat removed

- from the salt and the curves of item 1 above (e.g. , Fig. 7).

Using the above as the starting point, follow the calculational pro-
cedure of Table 4 using constant increments in AQ;, the enthalpy
change in the molten salt.

Compute AQ; for the value of AL found in item 7 (Qs = UphpALAL/L).

Repeat steps 6, 7, and 8 for a better approximation if the changes in
mean temperatures yielded by these steps differ by more than 20% from
the values estimated in step 5.

Repeat the above for new increments of length using the same incre-
ment in AQ; until TAQ; = @Q. oo :

If there is trouble with convergence, change the value of Uj by chang-
ing the length or effectiveness of the heat dam near the feedwater in-
let, It may also be advisable to change the proportions of the tubes.

For part load calculations, be careful to assume a small temperature
difference between the salt and the superheated steam for the first
increment in tube length if the temperature distribution along the
full length is desiréd, If the superheater exit temperature exceeds
by more than 100°F the value assumed for the part load condition, new
curves similar to those of Fig. 7 should be prepared. If instead one
wants a rough indication of the active tube length at part load, com-
pute a case as if it were a design point and compare the resulting
length with that for the 100% load condition.

compatibility with both the molten salt and the water, the tubes were con-
sidered to be of Hastelloy N. This is a high nickel alloy that has a rela-

tively poor thermal conductivity, an important factor in a supercritical

boiler because of the fairly thick wall required in the outer tube — in

this instance 0.075 in. It was found advantageous to increase the thermal

resistance of the inner tube wall at the lower end by making use of a

double-walled tube. In this region the 1/4-in. OD central tube with a wall
thickness of 0.010 in. was assumed to be lined with a smaller diameter tube

of the same wall thickness with a radial clearance of 0.002 in. between

them. The gap would be vented and, in view of the local metal tempera-

‘tures, would be filled with steam rather than water.

-The reason for using the tube liner can be seen by envisioning the
heat transfer situation at the bottom end of the reentry tube. Unless the
heat transfer rate from the salt to the superheated steam per unit of
length exceeds that from the superheated steam to the feedwater, the tem-

perature of the superheated steam will actually drop as it flows toward

the outlet. Inasmuch as the local temperatures of the salt, the super-
heated steam, and the feedwater are fixed, and so, too, are the surface
areas and the surface heat transfer coefficients, a simple solution is to
interject some “extra thermal resistance between the feedwater and the
superheated steam. This region need not be very long because the steam
exit temperature is relatively insensitive to the steam temperature well
above the exit. Further, to keep the overall tube length down it is de-

sirable to maintain a large temperature difference between the salt and

the superheated steam. Thus one. of the places where judgment is required

vhen making the stepwise calculations ‘is in choosing the point at which to
terminate the heat dam formed by the liner of the inner tube.
It should be noted “that introducing ‘the above liner in the inner

. tube will act to improve the boiling flow stability characteristics of

the reentry tube boiler. Not only will it increase the pressure drop in

the inlet region but it will also increase the fluid velocity there, both
helpful factors. iE oo

Heat Transfer Coefficients

Heat transfer coefficients for the molten salt were computed using
the Dittus-Boelter relation and physical properties supplied by J. W. Cooke.
From these the chart shown in Fig. 1 10 was prepared. In computing the over=-
all heat transfer coefficients for the inner and outer tube walls, the
molten salt velocity was taken as constant for all of the conditions con-
sidered, and hence the heat transfer coefficient for the fluid film on the
salt side vas constant. The temperature drop through the tube walls would,
~ of course, be directly proportional to the heat load, and hence these two
represent constant conductances. The heat transfer coefficient for the

superheated steam flow in the annulus varied directly with the 0.8 power

of the steam flow rate and hence this was the dominant factor at low flow
rates. The heat transfer coefficient for water under nucleate or annular

£iim boiling conditions is almost independent of heat load and is very
"high, hence it had a relatively small effect. on variations in the overall
heat transfer coefficient with load. |

~The calculated values for the overall heat transfer coefficients

through the inner and outer walls are presented in Fig. 11 as a function
of the steam flow rate. ‘The principal resistance to heat transfer at the
ower steam flow rates is that in the surface films in the superheated
steam annulus, whereas at high 1dads the principal resistance is repre-
sented by the temperature drops through the tube walls. |

An inherent error in the calculation procedure stems from the use of
a constant heat transfer coefficient on the water side throughout the
length of the boiler. For the flow rates employed here, annular film
boiling would prevail through the greater part of the boiler until the
vapor quality reached about 90% after which the heat transfer coefficient
would drop. rapidly. However, this effect is small at or near supercritical
pressures, and the heat transfer coefficient in the first portion of the
superheater is about as high as in the "boiling" zonel® (see Fig. 12).
This in effect ‘compensates for the reduced heat transfer coefficient in
the last portion of the boiler. These variations have ‘relatively small
effects in the region of interest here and were neglected for the purposes

of these calculations.

Temperature Differences and Heat Fluxes

The appropriate curves of Figs. 5, 6, and 7 were used as the basis
for estimating the effective local temperature differences in any given
increment of tube length. From these temperature differences, together
with the heat transfer coefficients and. the amount of heat added in the
increment, it is possible to calculate the length of the first increment
of outer tube length and the amount of heat transmitted across the inner
tube wall. These exchanges of heat in turn make it possible to calculate
the temperature in each fluid stream at the beginning of the next incre-
ment of the length. Note that the average local temperature differences
for each increment as used in the calculations were estimated, and gen-
erally differed a little from the values indicated by the completed cal-
culations for the increment. The difference was usually sufficiently
small so that iteration was not necessary. To facilitate the use of
Figs. 5, 6, or 7, the summations of the amounts of heat added or subtracted
to each fluid stream up to and including each increment were also tabulated
together with the fractions of the total heat added to the water-side stream.

Pressure Drop

The pressure drop across each increment of tube length was also cal-
culated in Table 4. To facilitate these calculations, Fig. 13 was prepared
to show the density of the fluid on the steam side as & function of its
temperature. For the subcritical pressure boiling conditions the density
in any given increment of boiler tube length was estimated by considering
the fractional change in density in the boiling zone as equal to the frac-
" tion of heat added to the steam ap to ‘that point in the boiling region.
No attempt was made to allow for the effects of the two-phase flow friction
factors, but it is believed that the overall effects of these would amount
to only about a factor of two in the boiler region, and, of course, there

‘would be no effect on the pressure drop in the superheater region.

Estimated Performance Characteristics

-

The prime objective of this study was to investigate the effects of
both the design heat load and the design steam temperature ‘and pressure
conditions on the boiler tube length. Once these effects are established
for a single tube it is easy to estimate the effects of the choice of the
full-pover steam pressure and temperature on the size and cost of a full-
scale steam generator. Further, once these effects are established for a
single tube, the effects of the mode of control on the part load tempera-
ture and pressure distribution can be inferred readily, and inferences can
be drawn with respect to the startup and part load control characteristics
and possible boiling flow stability problems.

Effects of Design Heat Load on Tube length

A study of the fine structure of the heat transfer relations indicates

that; if a prime criterion is considered to be completion of boiling prior
to exit from the inner tube, the boiler tube length is determined by the
maximum load conditions anticipated. That is, the tube length required
for boiling to dryness will be reduced as the design heat load is reduced.
This effect is shown in Fig. 14 for the two control modes shown in

Figs. 5 and 7, that is, a constant steam generator discharge pressure ir-
respective of heat load and a steam generator discharge pressure directly
proportional to the load. In all cases the calculations were carried out
to determine the tube length required to meet that particular design con-
dition.

Effects of Design Heat Load on Temperature Distribution

A more detailed insight into the effects of design heat load on a

reentry tube boiler is given by Fig. 15 which shows the calculated tempera-

ture distribution in the boiler as a function of distance from the bottom,
"and indicates the length of tube required to evaporate the water to dry-
- ness in the inner tube for a wide range of steam conditions. In this in-
stance the boiler exit pressure was proportional to the load. Note how
little tube length will be required for the 1% load condition. Note, too,

that the curves for the tube length and pressure drop in Fig. 14 rise
steeply between the 100 and 200% load conditions, thus implicitly Justi-
fying the choice of flow rate for the nominal 100% load condition. Ac-
tually, the choice of steam flow rate for the 100% load condition in this
case was arrived at by a series of preliminary calculations with just this
point in mind. oo

. The effects on the temperature distribution of the design heat load
per tube for operation with the system pressure held constant irrespective
of the load are shown in Fig. 16. Comparison of Figs. 15 and 16 indicates
that the design steam pressure has only a mild effect on the required tube -
length at a given heat load, in spite of the fact that the reduced pres-
sure greatly depresses the temperature in the boiling region.

\

Effects of Part Load Operation

If a boiler tube length for, say, the 100% reference design load con-
dition of Fig. 15 were chosen as the basis for a design, it is evident that
at part load the steam would be superheated to a temperature higher than
that indicated for the particular cases shown in Fig. 15 because these vere
calculated on the basis that the inner tube would be terminated at the
point at which boiling was completed. The superheating effects would be
particularly large at low steam flow rates where the steam temperature in
the annulus would run close to the local molten salt temperature through
the upper portion of the tube until it dropped when chilled by heat extrac-
tion for boiling the water rising in the inner tube. This effect is shown

in Fig. 17. The calculations were carried out by recognizing that vir-
“tually all of the heat transferred from the salt to the superheated steam

in any given increment would flow directly into the boiling water in the
inner tube. Thus, as a first approximation, it was assumed that UjA At; =
UoAoAt,, which then defined t, and ts. A check showed that this does in
fact give a good approximation and no iteration was needed in most cases.
The reason for this is that the enthalpy change in the outer annulus at the
10% load condition is only sbout 5% of the enthalpy rise in the inner tube.
It should be noted that to get good convergence the detailed calcula-~
tional technique of Table A was used for the cases of Fig. 17. This

represented an improvement over that used for Figs. 14 through 16 and is
the reason for a small difference in tube length that may be noted between
Figs. 15 and 17. The heat transfer calculations for Figs. 14 through 16
could be repeated to give better approximations. This was not done for
this preliminary study because it was felt that the effect would be small,
and, in any event, unimportant so long as the tube length required for
evaporation to dryness in the inner tube is less at part load than at full
load.

Pressure Drop and Pressure Distribution

Figure 18 gives a set of curves similar to those for Fig. 16 to show
the pressure rather than the temperature distribution through the boiler
for the load conditions of Fig. 5, i.e., a varying heat load with a con-
stant boiler pressure. Note that the much smaller flow passage area in
the inner tube gives a much higher mass flow rate than in the annulus for
the superheated steam, and this offsets the effect of the higher fluid den-
sity in the inner tube to such an extent that the overall pressure drop
through the inner tube is substantially greater than that through the outer
gnnulus,

This effect is desirable from the standpoint of boiling flow stability.
Note also that the pressure drop at low loads becomes very small — too
small to contribute to boiling flow stability. Under these conditions the
principal factors ‘contributing to boiling flow stability would be the sta-
tic head of the liquid column in the inner tube and capillary effects,
which would be substantial inside the small diameter inner tube. The
latter are believed to represent a little recognized advantage of small
diameter boiler tubes.

Figure 19 presents a set of curves to show the effects on the pres-
sure distribution of varying the design heat load with the system pressure
directly proportional to the heat load instead of constant as for Fig. 18.
It is interesting to note that the pressure drop through the boiler falls
off much more rapidly with a decrease in load if the system steam pressure
is held constant than if the steam pressure is made directly proportional
to the load. - Thus there should be less tendency toward difficulties with

boiling flow instabilities under light load conditions if the system is
designed so that the boiler discharge pressure varies linearily with the

power output.

Effects of the Fraction of Heat Added in the Inner Tube

Perhaps the most important arbitrary assumption made in order to pro-
vide a starting point for the iterative calculations was the fraction of
the heat added in the inner tube. A series of calculations was carried
out to investigate this effect for the load condition found to be most sen-
sitive on this score, i.e., 10% of the reference design load. The results
of these calculations are plotted in Fig. 20. These curves indicate that
the results are relatively insensitive to the initial assumption for rea-
sonable values of Q3/Q, i.e., Qa/Qy less than 80%. Thus terminating the

center tube when boiling is completed gives a well-proportioned design.

Effects of Size of Heat Increment Used

Initially the calculations were carried out using increments in the
amount of heat transferred equal to 20% of the total for the tube. These
coarse increments led to quite serious convergence problems, hence the
size of the increment was reduced to 10% of the total heat load. This
gave good convergence except at loads of 10% or less where the temperature
of the superheated steam vascillated with a period double the increment
used for the calculation in the manner shown in Fig. 21. This effect was
largely eliminated by reducing the increment of heat transferred to 5%
instead of 10%. Figure 21 shows that doubling the number of calculational
increments not only reduced the amplitude of the oscillation but it also
reduced the period of oscillations. This further confirms the belief that
the oscillation is an artifact of the calculational procedure.

Turbine Control Considerations

As will be shown later, the steam generator design proposed here in-

herently gives a nearly constant superheater steam outlet temperature

irrespective of load. This, coupled with the very small water inventory,
makes a method of power plant control implicit in Fig. 7 Took attractive.
The inherent characteristics make possible simple and reliable control
equipment and instrumentation, and the plant response characteristics ap-
pear to be much better than for conventional fossil fuel plants. In view
of its promising characteristics but highly unorthodox nature, R. B. Briggs
urged the writer to discuss this control approach with turbine design
engineers. Talks with several different engineers at both Westinghouse and
General Electric in each case seemed to lead them to conclude tentatively
that there is no apparent reason why it shouldn't work, - and they suggested
that an evaluation of permissible rates of change of load be made using a
typical chart supplied to operators of power plants. A chart of this type
from a turbine operators manual prepared by Westinghousel? is shown in

Fig. 22.

Limitations on Rates of Change in Load v

It should be mentioned that a major limitation on the operation of a
large steam power plant is the rate at which the load can be changed. One
set of limitations in coal-fired plants is associated with the furnace and oo
boiler; these not only have an enormous thermal inertia but the boiler
performance is sensitive to changes in temperature distribution in the fur-
nace as a consequence of changes in the flame geometry with changes in
load. A second and usually more stringent set of limitations is associated
with the turbine. The close running clearances between the rotor blade
tips and the casing make it imperative that these two components change
temperature together. However, the temperature of the thin rotor blades
operating in the high velocity steam follows the steam temperature with
virtually no phase lag, but the thick-walled casing does not. Further,
there are major circumferential asymmetries in the casing, partly because
it is split horizontally through the centerline and the upper and lower
halves are joined by a heavy bolting flange, and partly because the steam

LJ

inlet and outlet passages enter the casing from the bottom side. Thus, to .
avold catastrophic interference between the rotor and the casing as a con- (J

sequence of differential expansion between the rotor and the casing or

because of distortion in the casing, it is generally necessary to limit
the rate of change of the steam temperature to a low value. Obviously, it
would be highly advantageous to the electric power plant system operator
if he could change the load on a unit rapidly. Thus it is interesting to
use Fig. 22 to evaluate the time required to change load in a plant having
the characteristics of Fig. 7.

Startup and Rates of Change of Load with Proposed System

Considering first the startup conditions, it is helpful to quote from
Ref. 17, p. 8, the steam pressure and temperature conditions to be estab-
lished prior to starting the turbine-generator unit:
For drum type boilers, establish about 25% of rated pres-

sure and at least 100°F superheat, but not more than 800°F
total temperature, at the turbine throttle valves.

For once-through (drumless) boilers, a reduced pressure

start is recommended. This applies to both "cold" and "hot"

starting of turbine units. For "cold" starts, the boiler should

be stabilized before opening the throttle valves and the inlet

temperature held to 800°F maximum.
Thus the turbine-generator should be started with a low steam pressure at
the turbine throttle valve if one is used. If a throttle valve is not
employed, then the steam pressure delivered by the steam generator must
emphatically be at a low value. From the standpoint of the steam pressure,
it appears from Fig. 7 that the control scheme proposed should be satis-

factory. - However, the steam temperature will be too high, and hence a de-

superheater would be required to hold the steam temperature to 800°F at the

“turbine. Such units are commonly used in conventional coal-fired plants.

Once the turbine has been brought to equilibrium at a load of perhaps
10% at a pressure of 400 psi (see Fig. 7), the time required td increase
the steam temperature up to 1000°F (i.e., close to the normal operating
temperature of about 1050°F) can be estimated from Fig. 22 to be 40 min, a
substantial period, but one consistent with conventional practice. Once
the system is up to operating temperature, however, changes in load can be
made relatively quickly. - If one wishes to go from the 10% load condition
of Fig. 7 to the 50% load condition, this will entail increasing the

pressure by 1600 psi but the temperature by only about 30°F. . According

to Fig. 22 the turbine could tolerate making this change in only 11 min.
Similarly, if the turbine were operating at full load, the load could be
cut in half in as little as 20 min., i.e,, substantially faster than the

- common, rule of 2% min. Further, if the steam generator can be designed

so that the superheater outlet temperature increases somewhat with a reduc-
tion in load, even faster rates of change can be tolerated, For example,
if the full load steam pressure and temperature were 4000 psi and 1000°F
and the 50% load conditions were 2000 psi and 1050°F, Fig. 22 indicates
that the load change could be made in about 1 min. As will be shown later,
it happens that the reentry tube steam generator can be proportioned to
give this characteristic and hence would make. possible unusually rapid
changes in load.

Possibility of Eliminating the. Throttle Valve

. Stéam throttle valves are sg ma jor source of operating trouble in
steam power plants. The valves are relatively large, must operate at
about 1000°F, they are subject to heavy loads by the high steam pressure

“drop across them, and lubrication conditions are highly unfavorable, Thus

it is not surprising to find that throttle valve sticking is one of the
principal causes of forced outages in steam power plants.
Throttle valves are used to make it possible to change the steam flow

" rate much more rapidly than can be accomplished by controlling the boiler

and furnace in conventional coal-fired plants. The most critical consid-
eration is to avoid a serious overspeed of the turbine in the event of an
abrupt and complete loss of the electrical load. The inventory of super-

heated water in the reentry tube boiler is vastly less than in a conven-

tional boiler; it is estimated to be only about 3 in. 3 /tube at full load,
and about 1 in.2 at 10% load on the steam generator. Note that as a con-
sequence of mechanical, electrical, and fluid friction losses, etc. in the
turbine-generator unit, in the event of a complete loss of electrical load
the steam flow required to keep the turbine up to speed would be about 10%

of the full power output of the steam generator. Thus an abrupt loss in

electrical load would entail a reduction in the superheated water inventory
 

 

 

54

in a reentry tube boiler by about 2 in.3/tube, or 4 in.?/Mw(t). This full
load steam flow rate is about 3 1b/sec for 4 Mw(t), whereas 4 in.3 of
superheated water is only about 0.1 1b. Thus the full load steam flow
rate would consume the surplus water inventory in only about 1/30 sec if
the feedwater supply were abruptly cut to the 10% load level. The inertia
“of the massive rotor in the turbine-generator unit should be sufficient
"to keep the overshoot in rotor speed to a low value. Inasmuch as the most
difficult condition to meet is that for an abrupt loss in electrical load,
it appears that control of the power plant could be accomplished by con-
trolling the feedwater flow rate with one or more relatively small valves
operating at about 650°F rather than the large, hot steam throttle valves
normally employed. This should give a greatly increased reliability.

It is of interest to note that this approach to the control of a Ran-
kine cycle plant has been analyzed and investigated experimentally and is
a very similar but much smaller system designed for a nuclear electric
space power plant.18 The analyses and tests gave highly encouraging re-
sults for a system in which the thermal inertia of the boiler was small as
in the system proposed here. Further, the variable pressure approach is

coming into use in conventional plants.l®
Proposed Design for a Molten Salt Reactor Plant

A conceptual design for a molten salt reactor with its intermediate
heat exchangers and fuel pumps integrated into a common pressure vessel is
presented in a companion report, 20 ‘The net electrical output in that.
"study is 1000 Mw(e) and the fuel and inert salt temperatures are those

"- given in Fig. 4a. Plant layout studies favored-the use of six steam gen-

~erators each of which would be directly coupled to one of six fuel-to-NaEBF,
heat exchangers, The steam generators required for this plant provide a
good illustrative example for use here to show how the single tube analyti-
cal work presented earlier in the report can be applied to the design of a
full-scale steam generator as well as the proportions to be expected in a
‘finished unit.

Reheaters

Most modern steam plants employ reheaters, in part because there is a
direct increase in overall cycle efficiency of about 5%, and in part be-
cause they give a further indirect increase in cycle efficiency of a few
percent by eliminating the moisture churning losses in the lower stages of
the turbine. In addition, reheaters can be designed to eliminate the pos-
sibility of turbine bucket erosion in the lower turbine stages by reducing
the moisture content in that region to almost nothing. In conventional
coal-fired steam plants the length of piping required to connect the boiler
to the reheater and the relatively large amount of tube surface area re-
quired because the reheater must be located in a relatively low-temperature
zone to avoid burnout difficulties have combined to make the cost of in-
cluding provisions for reheat rather high for conventional coal-fired
plants. However, it is believed that in a molten salt reactor plant the
turbine can be located much closer to the steam generator and, because
there is no danger of tube burnout from excessive local temperatures, a
much higher average heat flux through the reheater tube walls can be main-
tained so that the tube surface area requirements are quite modest. Fur-
ther, the design of the tube matrix for the reheater is quite straight-
forward because there are no flow stability or two-phase flow problems in-
volved. Thus a reheat cycle appeared highly desirable for this design
study, and the two reheat stages specified for Eddystone Unit No. 2 have

been included in the proposed steam generator for:a molten salt reactor.

General Description

The dominant consideration in choosing the steam generator overall

geometry was “to make use of the static head in ‘the. liquid column in the

boiling region to help provide for flow stability in the boiler. This

meant that the boiler tube should be vertical with the feedwater entering

at the bottom. ‘While it would have been desirable from the standpoint of
thermal convection in the molten salt system to admit the molten salt at
the top and have it leave at the bottom, a brief glance at the temperature

distribution diagrams shown in Figs. 4, 5, 6, and 7 is sufficient to show
 

 

56

that the salt should move counterflow relative to the superheated steam in
the outer annulus. Figure 23 presents a somewhat similar diagram including
the two reheater stages and shows that they, too, should be in counterflow.

Tt was thought at first that it would be desirable to make use of
separate casings for the boiler and the two reheaters, but the additional
piping, manifolding, and associated temperature distribution problems led
to the conclusion that it would be best to mount the reheater tubes in an
annulus surrounding the boiler tubes in the configuration shown schema-
tically in Fig. 24. -

Headering Problems

As mentioned earlier the headers envisioned for the boiler region
would entail the thermal sleeve arrangement shown in Fig. 3. This avoids
‘the use of a high pressure header sheet in contact with the molten salt;
rather, the tubes would be manifolded below the pressure vessel containing
the molten salt. The same arrangement could be employed for the reheater
tubes. In either case any tube could be blocked off readily outside the
steam generator casing in the event of a leak or other malfunction. Inss-
much as the reheater tubes are free of the complexities associated with the
inner tube used for the boiler, it would also be possible to assemble them
in bundles of perhaps 12 tubes with the tube bundle headers inside the
casing of the steam generator .to minimize the number of penetrations
through the shell, This looks preferable if a unit has more than 100 tubes.

Provision of adequate space for header sheets is always difficult
when designing heat exchangers with closely spaced tubes. Preliminary lay-
out studies indicate that this is difficult but might be done with the con-
figuration of Fig. 25 without severely distorting the outer casing or hav-
ing a large volume of inert salt that serves no useful function but in-
creases both the capital investment and the time required for the system
to respond to control actions. The outlet spigots from bundles of 16
tubes could be passed through a header sheet in the bottom head of the
vessel with a thermal sleeve to avoid large local stresses. This would
give an adequate ligament thickness (about 0.5 in.) in the header sheet
after allowing space for the thermal sleeves. This will take up most of

the area of the elliposidal head in the region where its radius of curva-
ture is large. The space just outside this region but inside the shell
will serve as the inlet plenum for the molten salt which would enter tan-
gentially through two pipes. The 96 spigots from the tube bundles could
be manifolded outside the header sheet using a bifurcated tube arrange-
‘ment similar to that of Fig. 25. Three steam pipes could be coupled to
each set of 32 tube bundles. The feedwater could be supplied through two
penetrations in the largest bifurcated colipling in each of these three
sets. :

The layout envisions installation of small header drums for the re-
heater tube bundles in the sennulus just above the salt inlet plenum. The
annular baffle between the reheater region and the boiler-superheater re-
gion would extend downward no farther than the header drums for the re-
heater tube bundles.: | |

The layout problems would be eased by reducing the number of boiler
tubes in each steam generator unit and employing a large number of units.
The ratio of tube matrix cross-sectional area to header sheet area could
be increased in this way and manifolding problems of the tubes for the

feedwater and superheated steam could be eased.

 

Differential Thermal Expansion

There would be no problem associated with differential thermal expan-
sion between the boiler tubes and the steam generator casing because the .
top ends of the tubes would be free to float axially. However, the re-
heater tubes will tend to run at a somewhat different temperature than the
casing and hence some means for providing flexibility should be employed.
Probably the easiest way to accomplish this will be to install the tubes
on a spiral having a steep pitch, i.e., perhaps a total twist of 60 deg
in the length of the regenerator region. This could be chosen to provide
sufficient flexibility in the tubes so that the differential thermal ex
pansion between the tubes and the shell would be accommodated elastically.
The pitch would be steep enough so that the lateral loads on the tubes
would probably not be large enough to mske it necessary to employ addi-
tional structure to resist the forces associated with the small amount of

- erossflow that will occur.

Geometric and Performance Data

The calculations and principal ‘geometric and performance data for the
complete steam generator are summarized in Table 5, Recent revisions in
the physical properties of NaBF,, particularly in the viscosity, made it
desirable to change the salt mass flow rate through the steam generator
from the value of 2500 1b/sec ft? used in the calculations of Table 4 and
those for Figs. 11 and 14 through 20. This, coupled with the changes in
physical properties, led to a change in the tube length required.

The heat load for the boiler-superheater and each of the reheaters
was used to calculate the number of tubes for each matrix, with the molten
salt streams for each section treated as flowing independently of each
other with no lateral heat transfer. Note in the first portion of Table 5
that steam bleed-off in the turbine through seals and for feed heating re-
duces the steam flow rate to the reheaters so that it is substantially less
than the steam flow rate to the boiler.

Cost Estimate

A rough estimate of the cost of the steam generator of Table 5 can be
obtained by summing the estimated costs for the three major items, i.e.,
the shell, the tubing, and fabrication of the tubé-to-header joints. This
has been done and the results are summarized in Table 6. Note that the
overall cost amounts to about $7.05/kw(e), which compares with around
$20/kw(e) for the comparable portion of a conventional coal-fired boiler.
(These cost estimates were made on the basis of unit costs as of 1968. )
Thus it appears that the combined effects of a uni formly high heat flux,

small dismeter tubes with relatively thin walls, and elimination of the

need for pressure vessels subject to high pressures much more than offsets
the high cost per pound of Hastelloy N. | EE
The proportions given in Table 5 were not iterated to meke both the

tube length and the molten salt pressure drop for the boiler-superheater

and the two reheaters the same. This could and should be done, but the
combined effects of uncertainties in the calculated heat transfer coeffi-
cients and friction factors are large enough to make this an unwarranted

refinement at this stage.

Conclusions

The proposed reentry tube boiler appears to offer a long-sought solu-

tion that satisfies all of the major requirements for the steam generators

of liquid metal and molten salt reactor power plants. It appears to be

well suited to the generation of steam at any desired pressure and tempera-

ture condition with good stability and control characteristics throughout

the range from zero to full power, It lends itself to designs in which
the thermal stresses throughout the unit can be kept within the elastic
range under all operating conditions. The heat flux is uniformly high so
that the inventory of structural metal or liquid metal and molten salt is

near minimal, the number of tube-to-header joints is relatively small,

. there is no high pressure header sheet in contact with the high-temperature

liquid, there appears to be no unusual fabrication problems, and the capi-
tal cost appears to be competitive. The only apparent disadvantage is
that the concept is novel and has not been tested.

The performance characteristics of reentry tube boilers presented in
this report represent rough preliminary approximations based on a set of
simplifying assumptions. Test experience with a unit employing at least
three full-scale tubes would provide a firm foundation for the design of a
large unit. |

Recommendations

A test unit consisting of one or a few tubes should be built and
tested. In the test program particular attention should be given to the
investigation of possible boiling flow instabilities under startup, near-
zero power, and part load operating conditions to see to what extent ori-
ficing may be required at the feedwater inlet. The test program should

‘also include an investigation of the overall stability and control charac-

teristics under steam conditions ranging from 100 psia to 4000 psia. -
Most of the problems and uncertainties associated with the reentry
tube boiler could be investigated vith a relatively simple single tube unit
fitted with clamshell heaters. Such a unit could be built and tested ex-
peditiously and inexpensively, and would lend itself nicely to a detailed
 

66

investigation of the temperature distribution along the tube under a wide
range of conditions as well as facilitate modifications such as the inser-
tion of inlet orifices.

An electrically heated single tube test will probgbly be very much
less convincing to most people than a long endurance test of a unit having
3 to 19 tubes heated by a molten salt. Such a test unit should give a
good demonstration of the freedom of the system from corrosion, mass trans-

fer, thermal stress, and boiling flow stability problems.
