INTRODUCTION

By the first part of 1953, the program for the sepa-
ration of lithium isotopes by chemical methods had expanded
and matured to such a point that it was believed an interim
report condensing the chemistry under one cover would be
advantageous. Consequently, under the direction of the pro-
ject director, G. H. Clewett, the task of compiling this re-
port was undertaken with the following original objectives:

(1) Organize all chemical and physical data
under one cover.

(2) Make data readily available with logical
presentation, visual representation, and
cross indexing.

(3) Evaluate data to give clear understanding
and stimulate research activity.

Although these objectives were not attained in their
entirety, they guided the assembly of this material.

This report is divided into two parts. The first part
is an evaluation of the data pointed toward an understand-
ing of some of the current problems. It is expected that
this section will rapidly become out of date as a better
understanding of underlying principles is obtained. The
second part contains physical and chemical data that should
be of more lasting value to those who continue development
of separation processes for lithium isotopes. The data pre-
sented are largely those available from classified infor-
mation available as weekly, biweekly, monthly, quarterly,
etc., reports from the divisions of the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory. In addition, several excellent topical reports
and handbooks issued by this laboratory have been drawn
upon heavily.

The ideas and methods utilized in the correlation and
evaluation of the data are not original with the authors.
The ideas of many of the chemists and engineers associated
with the project have been used freely. Special acknowledge-
ment should be given to the chemists in the Materials
Chemistry and Chemical Technology Divisions.

  
 

To the uninitiated, it may be well to illustrate
briefly the main features of a chemical system for the
separation of isotopes employing chemical reflux. It
may be seen in Figure 1 that the heart of the process is
an isotopic exchange and enrichment section which in most
instances is a column in which lithium amalgam flows
countercurrent to a lithium salt dissolved in a suitable
solvent. Next in importance are two reflux sections which
remove the lithium from the phase flowing from the column
and insert it into the phase flowing to the column. A
certain number of auxiliary processes, of course, are
necessary for continuous operation. The product in the
separation of lithium isotopes is enriched in lithium six
(Li¢) and the waste is enriched in lithium seven (Li7),

Experimental data from all of the systems investi-
gated for the chemical separation of lithium isotope have
shown the separation factor to be a marked function of
temperature. For this reason it is possible to consider
a unique method of achieving reflux known as the dual
temperature process. A simplified sketch of a dual tempera-
ture system for the separation of lithium isotopes is pre-
sented in Figure 2. This process has maximum utility when
it is possible to operate an exchange system between two
widely separated temperatures. The theory of the dual
temperature process is not given in this report but may be
found in the work of Spivack (114), Eidinoff (115), and
Demarcus (116).

I: CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM METHODS

 

A. INTRODUCTION

Theoretically, the energy requirements for the sepa-
ration of isotopes of the same element need not be any larger
than that needed to overcome the entropy of mixing of the
isotopes provided a thermodynamically reversible system is
employed. In addition to being slow at times, thermody-
namically reversible processes are difficult to obtain; how-
ever, it is desirable from an economic point of view to
approach these ideal conditions within engineering limits.
Processes carried out at chemical equilibrium offer this
opportunity.

The separation of isotopes by chemical equilibrium
methods is possible with two phase systems such as a gas
and a liquid, two immiscible liquids, a liquid and a solid,
or a gas and a solid. Since compounds of lithium which re-
main gaseous at room temperature are unknown, the sepa-
ration of lithium isotopes by chemical methods has been
limited to liquid-liquid and liquid-solid systems. At
present, all of the systems which have plant production
feasibility are liquid-liquid systems in which one of the
liquids is lithium amalgam. If lithium isotopic sepa-
ration could be extended to a gaseous-liquid system by dis-
covery of a volatile lithium compound, perhaps some improve-
ments over present systems could be realized.

Separation of lithium isotopes in a system of lithium
amalgam in contact with lithium chloride dissolved in ethyl
alcohol was described by Lewis and MacDonald (110) in 1936.
This important contribution indicated that isotopic ex-
change took place with astonishing rapidity, that the sepa-
ration factor (a) per stage was at least 1.025, and that
the heavier isotope was found preferentially in the alcohol
phase indicating that chemical bonding of lithium in the
solvent was stronger than it was in the amalgam.

The separation factor, «o, may be defined by the
equation
(Li® /Li?) - amalgam
(Li®/Li7) - light phase
where the ratios shown are atomic ratios.

Systems involving lithium amalgam in contact with
lithium hydroxide in aqueous solution have been reported
in the literature (111) but confusion as to whether the
separation factors were due to equilibrium or to kinetic
effects developed because potentials were applied to
these systems to prevent lithium depletion through de-
composition of the amalgams. The isotopic separation
systems for lithium under current investigation may be
classified according to the stability of lithium amalgam
in contact with an organic or aqueous solution. Reactive
solvents such as water and various alcohols decompose
lithium amalgam to form lithium hydroxide or lithium al-
coholate and hydrogen gas. These solvents depend on a
slow rate of amalgam decomposition for their usefulness.
Much more research and development has been applied to
aqueous solution of lithium hydroxide in contact with
lithium amalgam than any other reactive system. Stable
solvent systems employ lithium chloride dissolved in
amines or unreactive ethers in contact with lithium amal-
gam. In this latter class of solvents, propylenediamine
(1,2, diamine propane) has received the most attention.

B. EXCHANGE EQUILIBRIA

The reasons for expecting separation factors for
systems at chemical equilibrium aredue to the difference
in chemical properties of isotopes of the same element.
These differences are accentuated with isotopes of ele-
ments of low atomic weight; consequently, chemical methods
of separation have proved to be the most efficient methods
available for separating isotopes of hydrogen, nitrogen,
carbon, boron, etc.

One method of representing the chemical separation of
lithium isotopes is illustrated in Figure 3. The heavier
isotope is found preferentially in the organic or water
phase indicating that the chemical stability of the lithium
in this phase is higher than the stability of the lithium
in the amalgam phase. Since chemical stability is associ-
ated with low free energy content, lithium in the propylene-
diamine phase, for example, is at a lower free energy level
than lithium in the amalgam phase. For the energy changes
indicated in Figure 3, we have

: 7 .7.,t o
Li’ (amalgam) —%— (Li') (PDA) + e, AF = -A (1)
Li’ (amalgam) —> (Li%)* (PDA) + e, AFC = -B (2)
where [A] is larger than |B| , but -A is smaller than -B.
Subtracting equation (2) from (1),
+
Li" (amalgam) + (Li%) (PDA) +Li® (amalgam) + (Li7)" (PDA) (3)
AF® = A + B = —C (4)

Since our illustration is greatly exaggerated, -C does not
represent a very large free energy change ( AF 2 - 31 cal.
at 25°C for the system in question).

The separation factor (a) and equilibrium constant for
equation (3) are identical since o is defined as the Li6é /Li7
ratio in the amalgam phase divided by the Li* /Li”7 ratio is
the amine phase. The dependence of a on temperature may be
given by the equations

 

 

 

- —AF%  AE° , as®
log, @ = “RT = RT + R (5)
and
_ AH®  as°®
a -1%-RT + TR (6)

where AH® and As® are assumed to be independent of tempera-
ture over small temperature changes. The binomial approxi-
mation that o« - 1 is equal to log, a contains an error of
less than 3% up to o = 1.06. The assumption that A H° and
AS~ are independent of temperature over the range of
temperature in which isotopic separation factors have been
measured (0 - 100°C) appears to be as accurate as the ana-
lytical methods available for the determination of isotopic
abundance. Other ideas concerning the dependence of sepa-
ration factors on temperature have been given by Begun, Drury
and Palko (111).

The temperature dependence of the separation factor for
three systems having approximately the same degree of chemi-
cal stability is shown in Figure 4. The agreement with
theory is within the accuracy of the data. Furthermore, it

should be noted that one of the systems investigated was

an aqueous solution of lithium hydroxide in contact with
amalgam in which a variable holding current was necessary,
yet the agreement with the other systems indicates the rate
of electrolysis and decomposition has little or no effect
on the separation factor.

Not all solvents for lithium salts in contact with
lithium amalgams yield similar results to those shown in
Figure 4. Table 1 illustrates the results obtained with
solvent of markedly different properties. Evidently, both
the salt and the solvent determine the separation factor
obtained in contact with lithium amalgam. This is explain-
able on the basis that different solvents have varying
affinities for lithium ions and that different salts dis-
sociate in varying degrees to produce lithium ions.

In a liquid-liquid method for chemical separation of
lithium isotopes, one of the difficulties encountered in
the development of economical systems is the limited number
of solvents for lithium salts and lithium metal that are
available. Three factors limit the selection of an organic
solvent; limited solubility of lithium salts, rapid re-
activity of some solvents toward lithium amalgam, and emulsi-
fying characteristics of some organic solvents toward lith-
ium amalgam. The emulsification of amalgams has received
very little attention. Probably very few of the amalgam
"emulsions" described as such are true emulsions, but appear
to be insoluble reaction products containing chemically
bonded or physically adsorbed mercury.

Solvents for ionic salts as a rule have large dielectric
constants which are a measure of their ion separating and
isolating power. Other effects, however, appear to be more
important in the case of lithium chloride solubility.
Ethylenediamine which has a rather low dielectric constant
of 12.9 compared to 81.7 for water shows low solubility for
sodium and potassium chlorides, but high solubility for
lithium chloride. It is expected that propylenediamine
would have an even lower dielectric constant for it shows
only one-tenth the solubility for sodium and potassium chlo-
ride, yet lithium chloride is four times as soluble in pro-
pylenediamine than in ethylenediamine.

The logical conclusion to these results is that a
specific interaction exists between lithium and some solvents.
At least part, if not all, of this specific interaction effect
is the result of the coordination demanded by lithium ion.
With a coordination number of four, two ethylenediamine or
two propylenediamine molecules could be tightly bound to a
lithium ion. Because of steric effects due to the methyl
group, propylenediamine probably has a greater chance of
accomplishing the desired coordination.

The cyclic ether series gives even stronger indication
of this coordinating effect. Six membered rings are apparently
too large and any additional groups on a five membered ring
(tetrahydrofuran) also presents a molecule too large for four-
coordination. Tetrahydrofuran itself is the borderline size
for four-coordination as indicated by the inverse solubility
of lithium chloride with temperature. Table 2 illustrates
these conclusions.

Mercury as a solvent for lithium metal has many ad-
vantages and disadvantages for a liquid-liquid system.
Unfortunately, there are no alternate solvents for lithium
metal that remain liquid down to room temperature that have
been brought to the attention of the research groups.

C. EXCHANGE KINETICS

One property of alkali metal amalgams which deserves
particular attention is their high surface activity since
it may account, at least in part, for the rapid exchange of
isotopes. The application of Gibbs adsorption thermo-
dynamics to data obtained by Convers (26) and by Johnston
and Ubbelohde (112) indicates adsorption (surface excess)
of alkali metals at amalgam surfaces. Qualitatively, amal-
gams have been observed to disperse much more readily in
propylenediamine than mercury indicating the amalgam inter-
face has lower interfacial tension than the mercury inter-
face. The lowering of surface or interfacial tension upon
the addition of another component to a system is the result
of adsorption of the added component at the interface.

The limitations of analytical techniques for isotopes
and the extremely rapid exchange reaction (even at room
temperature) have made the direct observation of reaction
kinetics very difficult.

It is quite possible that with a rapid continuous
method of isotopic analysis, such as the neutron adsorption
technique, a system could be devised which would prove satis-
factory for such an investigation.

Theoretical stage heights obtained from operation of
isotopic exchange columns reflect the kinetics of the ex-
change reaction. If the reaction is diffusion controlled,
the following factors appear to be important to the amalgam
phase or solvent phase which ever is rate controlling:

(1) agitation, (2) concentration, (3) viscosity, and (4)
temperature. Of these factors, agitation is the most im-
portant since better agitation would produce larger inter-
facial areas as well as thinner diffusion films. If the
adsorption of lithium of the amalgam interface produces a
rigid film, the rate of formation of fresh surfaces may be
 

15

a rate controlling step. Temperature has only a slight
effect on diffusion controlled reactions.

If diffusion is not the rate controlling step in the
isotopic exchange reaction, the following factors appear
to be important: (1) interfacial area and (2) temperature.
An increase in interfacial area or temperature should in-
crease the rate of the reaction and decrease the stage
height; however, these two factors are difficult to vary
independent of each other in the system employing propylene-
diamine because interfacial tension increases with increased
temperatures resulting in poorer dispersions and lower inter-
facial areas. If the rate of the exchange reaction shows
first order dependence on the lithium concentration in the
amalgam (similar to the waste end reaction), then the stage
height should be independent of lithium concentration in
the amalgam.

II: REFLUX PROCESSES

 

A. INTRODUCTION

A major consideration in large scale isotopic sepa-
ration by equilibrium exchange is the reflux process. Re-
fluxes may be achieved by either physical or chemical pro-
cesses and many alternate schemes are possible.

No attempt will be made in this report to differentiate
between reflux methods with regard to economics and with the
exception of the dual temperature system discussion will be
limited to chemical reflux processes. Further, only those
schemes which appeared to have engineering adaptation to
existing systems have been considered.

The degree and rate at which the inversion (refluxes)
are attained are prime considerations in evaluating the re-
flux processes since the systems involved require recycling
of solvents.

The degree of inversion or removal of enriched lithium
from the amalgam phase (product reflux) is important in that
this material not only represents a valuable product but also
either its loss or its cycling to the waste end would greatly
 

16

affect the cascade equilibrium. On the waste end the last
traces of lithium must be removed prior to cycling the sol-
vent stream to the product end for even small amounts of
material are capable of reducing the enrichment to a point
where the desired product could not be attained.

The rate at which the reflux processes proceed is
equally important. It must be very rapid not only to yield
the desired degree of inversion, but also to prevent a
large holdup of material which would greatly influence the
length of time required to reach isotopic steady state con-
ditions.

B. THE DUAL TEMPERATURE PROCESS

The dual temperature process is applicable to any of
chemical isotopic exchange system employing nonreactive sub-
stances and in which the separation factor is a function of
temperature. It may be seen from Figure 4 that the sepa-
ration factor in several lithium systems is a function of
temperature.

The operability of the dual temperature process has
been demonstrated by the Materials Chemistry Division (See
ORNL reports 1238, 1306, 1401, YB 35-12, and ORNL CF 53-4-299).
The extremely rapid isotopic exchange noted in the laboratory
was confirmed by pilot plant data. Both ethylenediamine and
propylenediamine were utilized as solvents for lithium chlo-
ride in contact with lithium amalgam. Propylenediamine
appears to have the widest useful temperature range of from
room temperature to 100°C; however, the stability of pro-
pylenediamine above 100°C in the presence of an alkali amalgam
has not been well established.

A schematic representation of the dual temperature pro-
cess is shown in Figure 2. Since the effective separation
factor for a dual temperature system is dependent upon the
difference between the factors in the hot and cold columns
and is generally less than either one, many more stages are
required for this method than for a chemical reflux system
(to effect the same overall separation).
 

17

C. CHEMICAL REFLUX PROCESSES

Although chemical reflux schemes are classified in
this report according to which end of the isotopic exchange
system they are applicable, this is not entirely satis-
factory since many of the waste end refluxes can be tied
together into desirable overall processes. Two such pro-
cesses are illustrated in Figure 5 to indicate how reflux at
one end may supplement reflux at the other end.

1. Waste End Reflux

 

a. Electrolytic Reflux

Four reactions have been considered for the elec-
trolysis of lithium salts to form lithium amalgam: aqueous
electrolysis of lithium hydroxide with a mercury cathode,
aqueous electrolysis of lithium chloride with a mercury
cathode, electrolysis of an organic solution of lithium
chloride, and electrolysis of fused salts with a liquid 1lith-
ium product from the cathode. These may be illustrated in
the following equations:

2LiOH, +(potential) —> 2 Li(Hg) + 1/2 02 gas + H,0 (7)

LiClyq +(potential) —>— Li(Hg) + 1/2 Cly,, (8)

LiClorg + Na(Hg)+(potential) >—Li(Hg)+ NaCl; 9.190) (9)

LiCl( fused salt with KCl)+(potential)>Li(metal)+ 1/2 Cl, (10)

Industrial equipment and methods are available for the
processes utilizing reactions (7), (8), and (10). Current
efficiencies of 90% or higher have been reported for such
installations. Reaction (9) which has a mercury cathode and
a sodium amalgam anode would require an extensive cell de-
velopment program for successful application as a plant re-
flux method.

Under completely thermodynamically reversible conditions
reactions (7) and (8) would be impossible as only hydrogen
would be produced at the cathode. Under actual operating
conditions hydrogen ion develops an over-potential which pre-
vents the electrolysis of water. Certain impurities in the
electrolysis systems catalyze the formation of hydrogen by
lowering the over-voltage. Possibilities of minimizing this

important side reaction are: (1) purification of cell
feed, (2) addition of inhibiting agents that complex the
catalyzing impurities, and (3) removal of oxygen and other
depolarizing agents.

Reactions (8) and (10) if applied to organic systems
require the desolvation of the lithium chloride. This is
no problem with tetrahydrofuran or isopropanol according
to preliminary scanning experiments (see Part II - Lithium
Chloride-Isopropanol and Lithium Chloride - Tetrahydrofuranj;
however, with ethylenediamine and propylenediamine the
problem becomes significant. At the time of the writing of
this report, a research program was well under way for the
determination of vapor pressures of lithium chloride sol-
vates with propylenediamine. Preliminary scanning experi-
ments have demonstrated the engineering applicability of
several methods of thermal decomposition to this material
with success.

Reaction rates for systems involving electrolysis are
not generally defined in the same sense as those of the usual
chemical reaction. The kinetics are usually studied from
the single electrode standpoint*., They are complicated for
the usual type of rate study in that there are an increased
number of variables not strictly chemical in nature which may
be rate controlling or else have an effect on the rate con-
trolling step. Further, electrolytic reactions often have
complicating side or decomposition reactions which proceed
spontaneously.

From a viewpoint that the applied potential only over-
comes the driving force (free energy) tending to keep the
reactants in their present low energy state it is possible,
at least qualitatively, to look at electrolytic reactions
as though they were only simple chemical reactions with an
additional energy term involved. One such method of looking
at the rate process for an electrolytic reaction is as
follows. The equation:

k!

(E) + 2LiOH + (Hg) —— >. 2Li(Hg) + H,0 + 1/2 O,
represents a process that produces liquid lithium amalgam
Li(Hg). The rate of formation of amalgam may be represented
by:

Li(Hg)]
d Lit (He). - x' / [(E), LiOH, Li(Hg), 0, T] (11)

 

* For a detailed and quantitative approach the reader is re-
ferred to the work of H. H. Garretson (109) and W. E. Clark
(107).
20

where the items inside the brackets are variables which
are probably involved in the rate. The effects of these
variables have not been elucidated at this time. However,
for a given cell operating under steady state conditions
the reaction can be represented by the equation:

[Li(Hg)J
d —gt = k' (E) (12)

where k' is not a true rate constant but is dependent upon
operation at steady state condition with fixed current
density, temperature, concentrations, etc.

For the case under consideration the most important
side reaction is decomposition which proceeds as follows:

k
Li(Hg) + H,0 —5[LiOH] aq + 1/2 Ho + Hg

as)
The rate of disappearance of amalgam is given by the equation:

-d [Lichg)] = k, { {ne , LiOH, s, 1) (13)

where 'S' is the interfacial surface area between phases,

'T' the temperature: (Li(Hg)] the amalgam concentration,

and LiOH the hydroxide concentration. These variables

are known to effect the rate 29,30, In addition, this re-
action rate may be greatly affected by the catalytic action
of certain impurities which have low hydrogen over-voltages.
For example, the presence of oxygen is considered to greatly
accelerate the decomposition rate. Other variables not well
defined, such as, rate of agitation are incorporated into
the rate constant 'k,' by operating under fixed condition.

The function, { [Li(Hg)] , has been shown to depend upon
the one-half power of the amalgam concentration 29,30,108.
For constant conditions of lithium hydroxide concentration,
interfacial area, and temperature, equation 13 becomes:

[Li(Hg)] 1/2
-d dt = k,' [Li(Hg)] (14)
or
1/2 1/2
Li(H - [ri(m
on Li 8] [Li(Hg)] f (15)

 

t
21

The effect of hydroxide concentration has not been
clearly established, but available data tends to show that
the rate constant decreases in direct proportion to the in-
crease in hydroxide concentration 29. The pronounced
effect of temperature is shown by Figure 6. The effect of
the interfacial area per unit of amalgam volume upon the
rate apparently is directly proportional (1st order), but
methods of completely elucidating the actual area of the
surface involved have not been devised at this time.

By combining the electrolytic rate (equation 12) and
the decomposition rate (equation 14), one obtains an ex-
pression for the net rate of amalgam formation for steady
state conditions as follows:

[Li (HgJ] 1/2
d gt =k { (EB) - Kk [Li (Hg) (16)

Equation 16 qualitatively defines the kinetics of the

"Elex'" process. For example, if ky £ (E) is greater than

k; [Li(Hg)]1/2, the reaction rate is positive and lithium

is transferred from the aqueous to the amalgam phase. This
corresponds to the waste end reflux. When the two terms

are equal the rate is zero, and no net lithium transfer
takes place; however, the exchange reaction between isotopes
proceeds uninhibited. This corresponds to conditions main-
tained in the exchange section. Finally, when kj £ (E) is
less than kj; [Li(Hg)] 1/2 the rate is negative and net de-
composition of the amalgam occurs to provide a product end
reflux.

Similar treatment could be extended to the reactions
represented by equations 8-10; however, little is to be
gained by such a generalized development. It is important,
however, to recognize that these electrolytic refluxes are
complex and that the presence of traces of impurity can
greatly alter the rates especially by influencing the de-
composition reactions.

b. Magnesium Amalgam Reflux
Magnesium amalgam as a reflux agent is of importance
in systems using the amine solutions of lithium chloride.

have been worked out for propylenediamine solutions, but
they should apply equally as well to ethylenediamine so-
lutions. Reaction (17) proceeds very near completion be-
cause of the high stability and insolubility of the mag-
nesium chloride solvate with propylenediamine. However,
the equilibrium ratio of lithium to magnesium in the amal-
gam as a function of temperature or amine concentration has
not been fully investigated (57).

Laboratory batch data (90, 91, 92 and 100) indicate
that the conversion of magnesium amalgam to lithium amal-
gam follows a first order rate with respect to magnesium
in the amalgam and to be independent of lithium chloride
concentration in the amine phase as long as it was in
stoichiometric excess. The rate may be defined as follows:

[Mg (Hg)]
-d —af  - kMeg(He]] (18)

°F Mg (He),
= kt (19)

Me (He)

where [Mg(Hg)J]_, and [Mg(Hg)] ¢ are the initial and final con-
centration of The magnesium in the amalgam.

In addition to the effect of magnesium concentration in
the amalgam, the reaction rate is greatly influenced by the
degree of dispersion (interfacial contact area) of the two
phases. The optimum rate of agitation has not been estab-
lished but will probably vary considerably from one type of
equipment to another.

Increasing the temperature also increases the reaction
rate. However, the optimum rate is likely to be determined
by the maximum temperature for which the organic solvent
will remain stable in the presence of the amalgam phase
rather than by decreasing the holdup time to a point where a
further increase of rate would not be economical from an
equipment standpoint.

An important side reaction of the magnesium amalgam re-
flux is the chemical combination of trace amounts of water
with magnesium amalgam to form magnesium hydroxide and hy-
drogen as follows:

Mg amalgam + 2 HO —>»>- Mg(OH), + H, (20)

Although propylenediamine is a very hydroscopic solvent,
reaction (20) is likely to contribute heavily to preventing
any buildup of water in the solvent.
24

The favorable equilibrium conditions resulting from
reaction (17) making it an excellent reflux reaction for
the waste end of the exchange system are largely due to the
stability of the complex salt, MgCl, -3PDA. The chemical
stability, however, has prevented the utilization of simple
thermal methods for complete desolvation of the magnesium
chloride and recovery of the propylenediamine. (See Part II,
Magnesium Chloride - Propylenediamine System for Vapor
Pressure Data).

Chemical methods for recovery of propylenediamine by
cleavage of the MgCl, °3PDA structure fall into two classes:
(1) replacement of the propylenediamine with a cheaper
chemical having the ability of forming a more stable solvate
and (2) chemical reaction to form new salts that do not have
stable solvates with propylenediamine. Successful methods
have utilized ammonia in the first classification and sodium
hydroxide in the second.

Reaction of the solvate, MgCl, °3PDA with ammonia may
be illustrated as follows:

This reaction may be carried out either at room temperature
under pressure or below the boiling point of liquid ammonia
at atmospheric pressure. Research is currently under way to
disclose the details of this reaction.

The same reaction has been studied using methanol as a
solvent for the solvate, MgCl, 3PDA. (See Part II, Magnesium
Chloride - Ammonia - Methanol - Propylenediamine Systems). In
this instance, the amount of excess propylenediamine accompany-
ing the solvate, MgCl, *3PDA, limits the solubility of the
solvate. Apparently, lithium chloride dissolved in the ac-
companying propylenediamine also limits the solvate, MgCl, * 3PDA
solubility (see Figure 55). The degree of completion of the
precipitation of MgCl, :-6NH; from a methanol solution,

MgCl, -3PDA is highly dependent upon the concentration of
ammonia. Some propylenediamine has been found in the precip-
itate, MgCl, -6NH,, as may be seen in Figure 57. From the data
available, it is impossible to predict whether this propylene-
diamine content is the result of mechanical occlusion or
chemical interaction.

’
25

The reaction with sodium hydroxide may be carried out
in aqueous or nonaqueous media. The reaction is essentially
the same and may be illustrated as follows:

2 NaOH + MgCl, -3PDA —5— Mg(OH), + 2 NaCl + 3PDA (22)

The released propylenediamine must be separated from the sol-
vent (water or alcohol) before it can be considered as com-
pletely recovered. Although the propylenediamine can be
chemically released by reaction (22), because of the nature
of the magnesium hydroxide precipitate, physical recovery of
propylenediamine is difficult. Evaporation from the slurry
has been effective where water and 2-ethyl hexanol have been
used as solvents. Advantage may be taken of the two phase
immiscibility with excess aqueous caustic. With methanol as
solvent for sodium hydroxide, the magnesium hydroxide was
found to be filterable. These propylenediamine recovery
problems have been largely engineering in nature.

Regardless of the solvent used for reaction (22) the
rate of reaction and equilibrium are very favorable for the
release of propylenediamine. The reaction under agitation
proceeds more rapidly than measurements can be taken. The
propylenediamine remaining with the magnesium hydroxide is
held there by physical entrainment as the chemical reaction
apparently goes quantitatively to the right within the limits
of analytical measurements. Some decomposition of the pro-
Pylenediamine has been noted at high temperatures and high
caustic concentrations and constitutes a disadvantage of this
desolvation method. In alcohol solutions some dehydration of
the magnesium hydroxide may take place due to the great af-
finity propylenediamine shows towards water. If this dehy-
dration is appreciable, wet propylenediamine will result and
the advantages of using an alcohol solvent will be lessened.

Cc. Potassium and Sodium Amalgam Ref luxes

Both potassium and sodium amalgam reactions have
been shown to have application to the waste end reflux uti-
lizing propylenediamine as solvent. The reactions do not
proceed to virtual completion as they do in the case of mag-
nesium amalgam, and a mixed amalgam is the result in both
cases. The reactions are as follows:

K(amalgam) + LiC1(PDA sol'n)==LiK(amalgam) + KCl(ppt.) (23)
26

Na(amalgam) + LiCl(PDA sol'n)==LiNa(amalgam) + NaCl(ppt.) (24)

The conditions under which the mixed amalgam is produced is
that of high temperatures and high lithium chloride concen-
tration in the amine phase. These conditions are also ideal
for the reactivity of any trace amounts of water in the amine
phase with the mixed amalgam to produce insoluble lithium hy-
droxide and hydrogen gas.

Reaction rates for these types of inversion (similar to
isotopic exchange) are extremely rapid (93, 101). For this
reason the reaction mechanism has not been elucidated to this
date. It may be inferred, however, that the rate determining
step will be similar to that of the magnesium inversion re-
action and probably shows first order dependence upon the amal-
gam concentration.

An indication of why potassium or sodium amalgams reflux
at the waste end at high temperature, and yet at low tempera-
ture form very stable amalgams can be shown qualitatively from
thermochemical considerations.

Table 3 gives a series of idealized reflux reactions in-
volving alkali amalgams and alkali halide salts. The heats
and free energies are computed from data presented in Table 4.
These equations represent reactions in which no interaction
(solvation) of the halide salts would be involved, however,
the effect of solvation will be discussed in a following
paragraph.

From Table 3 it is observed that for these reactions
under ideal conditions at room temperature the formation of
lithium amalgam is slightly favored over sodium or potassium
amalgam. The tendency being much more pronounced with in-
creasing atomic weight of either the anion or the cation in
the salt.

Experimental data (See Part II: Lithium - Mercury -
PDA - NaCl - KCl) show that at room temperature lithium amal-
gam in contact with amine solution of sodium or potassium
chloride is unstable and an inversion to sodium or potassium
amalgam proceeds rapidly and to virtual completion (this is
discussed under product end refluxes). These data indicate
that the behavior of the halide salts in amine solution de-
viate widely. This behavior can be best understood by examin-
ing the solvation energies involved since a difference in

In the absence of any free energy data it is assumed that
they will be in the order of magnitude of the heats of re-
action. In this event the reactions shown in Table 3 will
have lower free energy in the direction which yields stable
sodium or potassium amalgam.

In order to appreciate the magnitude of the energy in-
volved in solvation more fully the system zinc halide versus
ethylenediamine is presented. Thermochemical data are avail-
able and are presented in Table 4. The solvation reactions
are presented in Table 5.

In addition to the magnitude of the heats of formation
of these solvates another fact becomes quite evident from
Table 5, i. e., apparently the anion contributes little to
the heat of formation. If this observation holds true for
systems involving lithium halides solvated with EDA or PDA
then it is expected that solvation energy would have a less
pronounced effect upon the inversion reaction in going from
sodium to potassium and especially from sodium chloride to
potassium iodide systems.

Lithium chloride may be desolvated from EDA or PDA by
heating to a moderately high temperature {113). From this
it can be concluded that the degree (energy) of solvation is
greatly affected by temperature. Such being the case at high
temperature the effect of solvation energy upon the reaction
given by equations 23 and 24 would be largely overcome and
the more idealized reactions (Table 3) proceed to yield
30

lithium or mixed amalgams. These conclusions are borne

out by examination of figures 43, 44 and 46 (Part II)

where the effect of temperature and lithium chloride con-
centration upon the inversion of potassium and sodium amal-
gams to lithium amalgam is shown.

2. Product End Reflux

 

a. Decomposition Reflux

Product end reflux with lithium amalgam in the
water system appears to be comparatively simple upon first
inspection. During isotopic exchange the decomposition of
lithium amalgam takes place all the time that the amalgam
and the aqueous solution are in contact. An applied po-
tential in the exchange system does not prevent decomposition
but replaces the amount decomposed. Thus reflux may be ob-
tained by discontinuation of an applied potential and/or an
increase in temperature of the system to increase the rate of
the reaction. The kinetics of this reflux have been pre-
viously discussed as a complicating or side reaction to the
Electrolytic Waste End Reflux Section, Page 17. Decomposition
is illustrated as:

Li(amalgam) + H,0 — LiOH + 1/2 Hz (gas) + Hg (28)

The similar type decomposition has application to systems
utilizing the simple alcohols as a solvent to replace water.

Li(amalgam) + ROH —s— LiOR + 1/2 Hz (gas + Hg (29)

)
The rate of reaction is expected to decrease with the series
of solvents - water, methanol, ethanol, propanol, etc., with
water having the highest rate of reaction; however, solu-
bility of the decomposition product decreases as the series
increases in molecular weight.

b. Hydrogen Chloride Reflux

Product end reflux with hydrogen chloride has
promise in exchange systems containing lithium chloride dis-
solved in a solvent in contact with lithium amalgam. At the
product end where lithium amalgam is to be decomposed and the
lithium sent back to the isotopic exchange system as lithium
chloride, the reaction with hydrogen chloride is perhaps the
fastest and most complete of all product end refluxes.

 
31

Li amalgam + HCl —— LiCl + 1/2 H, + Hg i (30)

One of the problems encountered in utilizing this re-
action is decreasing the rate of the reaction rather than
in increasing it as with other reflux reactions. The re-
action appears to go entirely to completion and at a rate
far too rapid for measurement under conditions applied to
date.

Two methods are available for application of this re-
action: (1) solution of the hydrogen chloride gas in the
solvent and subsequent contact with the amalgam phase and
(2) contact of the hydrogen chloride gas with the amalgam
with subsequent contact with the organic solvent. Only
the first method has been investigated to date. This has
proved to be successful with propylenediamine and iso-
propanol as solvents. With tetrahydrofuran, some reaction
of the solvent with hydrogen chloride was noted.

cc. Sodium and Potassium Chloride Refluxes

Product end reflux with sodium and potassium chlo-
rides has been extensively studied in amine solutions,
especially propylenediamine solution. The reactions in-
volved are the reverse of reactions (23) and (24). As pre-
viously discussed, it is evident that solvated conditions
of lithium chloride contributes greatly to the reversal of
these reactions at low temperature.

Several so-called equilibrium constants have been
given for the reflux reactions. This method of reporting
data may have many advantages but the fact that the equi-
librium constants are greatly different for the forward re-
action compared to the reverse reaction points to the con-
clusion that the given constants are not applicable beyond
the range of concentrations and temperatures in which they
were measured. It is quite evident that activities of the
constituents are markedly different from their concentrations
and have unusual temperature coefficients.

The rate determining steps in these reactions are
markedly different from those of the forward reaction given
by equation 23 and 24. Laboratory data (89 - 94) indicate
that the rate determining step is independent of (zero
order with respect to) the amalgam concentration and may be
interpreted to follow a rate:
 

32

[Li(Hg)]
aL kf [s, 1,] (31)

(Ih) is the interfacial area between phases. The quantity

(S) involves the surface area of the salt particles in the
slurry and is not well-defined. However, when a large ex-
cess of finely divided salt is used (S) is constant and
under conditions of fixed agitation (Ih) is approximately
constant.

For these conditions, equation 31 becomes:

- a LitHe)] K' (32)

, _ [Li(Hg)], - [Li(Hg)],

ty - ot

and

k (33)

 

These data indicate that the rate determining (slow) step

is the rate of solution of the salt particles. This is
further substantiated by the observation that the relative
magnitude of the rate constant is consistent with the rel-
ative solubility of sodium and potassium chlorides in pro-
pylenediamine. (See Pages 69, 70 for evaluation of rate
constants). Furthermore, the rate constant does not increase
as an exponential function of temperature which would be ex-
pected if a chemical reaction were the slow step.

Figure 26, (Part II) shows the results of laboratory in-
vestigation on the rate for sodium chloride inversion as a
function of the temperature, size and amount of sodium chlo-
ride particles in the amine phase. These data indicate that
size of the particles is more important than the temperature
in the rate determining step. The effect of agitation on
the rate constant has not been fully investigated.

As pointed out in the section on waste end refluxes for
the potassium or sodium amalgam Systems, temperature and lith-
ium chloride concentration have marked effects upon the final
degree of inversion. If the general behavior predicted by
the equations given in Table 3 holds then from equilibrium
considerations a sodium chloride system should yield a better
reflux than bromide or iodide in that a lower concentration
of lithium remaining the amalgam per given stage would result.
However, the rate at which equilibrium is achieved will
probably change in the opposite order due to increased solu- -
bility of bromide and iodide.

ITI: SOLVENT AND FEED PURIFICATION

 

A. SOLVENT PURIFICATION

As chemical technology advances, chemical specifi-
cations become more difficult to meet and engineering
complications increase. Certainly isotope separation is
no exception to this trend. For successful separation of
lithium isotopes by present chemical methods, exceptionally
low impurity levels are required that have and will con-
tinue to demand chemical research and engineering develop-
ment.

Impurities in the aqueous-amalgam system for lithium
isotope separation are: (1) those that cannot be toler-
ated because of the catalytic effect they have on the rate
of decomposition of lithium amalgam and (2) those that pre-
ferentially build up in some part of the system or dilute
the product. Quantitative knowledge of tolerances for im-
purities in the first class is unknown indicating the
necessity of further research. Having determined the cata-
lyzing impurities and their concentration effects, at least
two different avenues of approach should be investigated;

i. e., solvent purification by such means as filtration and
ion exchange, and the use of additives to poison or complex
the catalyzing impurities. The second class of impurities
may be controlled through feed purification.

Impurities in the organic-amalgam system for lithium
isotope separation are little understood except for the
system employing propylenediamine as the organic solvent.
Even with propylenediamine, the impurity problem is only
partially understood because pilot plant data for extended
operation are not available as yet. The tolerance for water
in propylenediamine is believed to be at least as low as
methods of analysis (less than 0.01% by weight) for propy-
lenediamine systems utilizing a waste end reflux with mag-
nesium, potassium, or sodium amalgam. No quantitative data
is available on the thermal stability of propylenediamine or
of the nature and effects of the decomposition products.

Methods of drying propylenediamine consist of dis-
tillation and chemical reaction methods. Benzene azeotropic
distillation (See Part II: Benzene-Propylenediamine and
   

34

Propylenediamine-Water Systems) has received engineering
attention. Some data on an alternate system are avail-
able (See Part II: Ethylene Glycol-Propylenediamine-
Water System). Chemical reaction of water in the propy-
lenediamine with calcium carbide which produces calcium
oxide and acetylene gas constitutes a successful chemical
method of drying propylenediamine.

Mercury, like propylenediamine may be purified by
distillation or chemical reaction. In this case, however,
the serious impurities are contaminating metals and not
water. Chemical reaction with an aqueous solution of di-
lute nitric acid under oxidizing conditions has long been
used as a satisfactory method of removing base metals from
mercury and need not be discussed here.

B. FEED PURIFICATION

Purification of lithium amalgam feed in the aqueous-
amalgam system has been investigated and it is understood
that partial decomposition of the amalgam has been success-
fully used to control sodium and potassium impurities; how-
ever, published data are not available as yet to sub-
stantiate the extent of the purification.

Among the systems using propylenediamine as a solvent,
lithium feed purification is most important to the closed
reflux system employing potassium chloride and potassium
amalgam as reflux reagents. Impurities introduced with the
feed are likely to build up in one of the reflux ends if
the solubilities of the impurities are exceeded. Since it
is possible to feed either lithium amalgam or lithium chlo-
ride solution to the exchange columns, a feed purification
section could be designed for either situation. Data on
the solubilities of the major impurities as metals in the
amalgam phase and as chlorides in the amine rhase are needed
as a function of temperature. Assuming withdrawal of pro-
duct and waste and introduction of feed are made in the same
phase, predictions could be made with solubility data as to
the extent of impurity build-up. In the absence of ex-
perimental data it appears that amalgam feed and amine feed
are equivalent provided either feed stream is equilibrated
against the opposite phase in a clean-up section prior to
introduction into the exchange columns.

 
35

Generally the drying of salts and metals utilized as
reflux reagents and isotopic exchange feeds can be ac-
complished by using a dry air except for lithium chloride
which forms a hydrate which is stable at room temperatures.
(See Part II: Lithium Chloride - Water System). In order
to obtain anhydrous lithium chloride drying at temperatures
above 100°C is required. Fortunately, little if any de-
composition to form hydrogen chloride takes place in the
drying operation (55).

Dry, inert atmospheres are required in all organic-
amalgam systems. Nitrogen and helium when properly puri-
fied have shown no reactivity toward amalgams (13,28,67).

CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL DATA

1. INTRODUCTION

A. ARRANGEMENT OF DATA

Systemization of information often leads to complexities
in presentation. The attempted arrangement of chemical and
physical properties presented here is organized in a some-
what complex but ordered manner. All information falls under
the general headings:

Lithium and Lithium Compounds
Magnesium and Magnesium Compounds
Potassium and Potassium Compounds
Sodium and Sodium Compounds
Liquid Solvents

Under each of the above-mentioned headings, technical
information is classified according to the initial chemical
components of the reactions or equilibrium systems under con-
sideration. While this method of presentation requires a
knowledge of the initial components of the chemical reactions
involved, it has an advantage of being self-indexing to those
who are aware of the method of arrangement. For example, in
the product end reflux with sodium chloride, lithium and
mercury are reacted with a slurry of sodium chloride in pro-
pylenediamine to produce a solution of lithium chloride in
propylenediamine and sodium amalgam. Lithium, mercury, sodium
chloride and propylenediamine are the initial components, and
the physical and chemical data for this reaction can be found
with the system "Lithium - Mercury - Sodium Chloride - Pro-
pylenediamine". This system is listed with other four com-
ponent systems under "Lithium" which is found under "Lithium
and Lithium Compounds' since this is the first general head-
ing that contains any of the four initial components.

In some systems the initial components are identical
with the chemical species present at equilibrium. Such is
the case with magnesium and mercury. The information con-
cerning solubility, density, viscosity, etc., is to be found
among the two component systems under "Magnesium" which is
under the general heading "Magnesium and Magnesium Compounds".

The compilation of all chemical and physical data on the
Orex process (as of April 1953) was one of the objectives
38

that guided the writing of this report. Much of the data

has been plotted or replotted in an attempt to obtain a
correlation and, consequently, allow for extrapolation

beyond the area of experimental results. Justification of
this procedure may be questionable in several cases where
limited precision or small number of data are available;
however, in the majority of cases, theoretical considerations
were utilized as a basis for this "best guess".

All data appearing in this report have been referenced
for easy access to the original publication and to give
credit to those who have derived the data. Some confusion
was encountered in the ORNL literature over the use of the
term "molarity". In many instances, molarity appeared to
be the number of moles per liter of solution regardless of
the temperature of the solution. In other reports, molarity
referred to the number of moles per unit weight of solution
corresponding to a liter at room temperature. When these
differences were recognized, they were tabulated in this re-
port accordingly.

The convention utilized in previous reports to indicate
liquid amalgam has been followed here; for example, liquid
lithium amalgam is designated as Li(Hg).

Missing from Part Two, Section VI, of this report are
the chemical and physical properties of water. These data
are tabulated in the usual handbooks of chemistry, and con-
sequently, they have been omitted in this report.
