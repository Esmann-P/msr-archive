ANP PROJECT SEMIANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT

SUMMARY

Part 1. Materials Research and Engineering

1. Materials Compatibility Research

The effects of oxygen pressures in the range between 3 X 10~° and
5 x 10~3 mm Hg on the reaction rates of oxygen with columbium and the
correlation of the reaction rates with the formation of the oxides of
columbium were studied at 850, 1000, and 1200°C. As the oxygen pressure
was increased from the lowest pressures, the following principal reactions
occurred: (1) solution of oxygen in columbium, (2) precipitation of CbO
and the formation of CbO, nodules, (3) CbO, film formation, and, finally,
at the highest pressures, (4) Cb,0s formation. Reactions that could be
attributed wholly to the solution of oxygen in columbium were not en-
countered except at 1200°C and an oxygen pressure of 3 X 107° mm Hg.

The studies of the reactions of columbium with low-pressure air were
extended to include tests at 1200°C. At an air concentration of 5 X 10~%
mm Hg, a linear reaction rate constant of 6.3 X 1074 mg/cm? min was ob-
served. In contrast, at an equivalent oxygen pressure, a reaction rate
constant of 4.5 x 10-2 mg/cm? min was obtained in pure oxygen. Mixtures
of argon and oxygen also lowered the reaction rate in comparison with
the reaction rate in pure oxygen. Although the reaction rates at these
low pressures are several orders of magnitude less than in oxygen or air
at atmospheric pressure, the rates are sufficiently high to cause
significant oxidation of columbium in a few hours.

Very small additions of oxygen to columbium were shown to increase
its room-temperature tensile strength. This increase in strength was
still evident after exposure to lithium at high temperature. However,
when the additions of oxygen were large enough to cause corrosion of
the columbium by high-temperature lithium, the addition of oxygen and

subsequent exposure to lithium resulted in decreased strength and ductility.

viii

 

 
 

Thin layers of carbide and nitride were formed on columbium~zirconium
alloy specimens after exposure to NaK in stainless steel containers at
elevated temperatures. The elevated~ and room-temperature mechanical
properties of the alloy were altered by this exposure.

Mass-transfer effects were observed in a NaK thermal-convection loop
constructed of Haynes No. 25 alloy which contained Cb—0.8% Zr specimens.

A very thin carbide layer was formed on the columbium~zirconium alloy, and
no significant alterations were found in its tensile strength or elongation.

Tests are being conducted to determine the compatibility of type 316
stainless steel with boiling potassium. Capsule and thermal-convection
loop tests conducted at 1600°F for several hundred, hours showed no signifi-
cant attack on the steel. Tests of several thousand hours duration are

now in progress.

2. Studies of the Aging of Columbium-Base Alloys

It was shown that wrought sheet of Cb—l.15% Zr received from CANEL
responded to aging heat treatments. The aging heat treatments were carried
out at 1700°F for periods up to 500 hr on material which had been annealed
for 2 hr at either 2190, 2550, or 2910°F. The effect of the aging treat-
ment on the mechanical properties of the alloy annealed at 2910°F was
pronounced, whereas the effect on the properties of the alloy annealed
at 2190°F was minor. The microstructure of the alloy annealed at 2910°F
and then aged presented a classical aging pattern.

The aging treatments were originally carried out in quartz capsules,
In order to determine whether the aging effects were due to silicon con-
tamination from the quartz, the aging experiments were carried out again
in columbium capsules on material annealed at 2910°F. The tensile strength
and elongation data were essentially the same as obtained with the quartz
capsules.

Aging studies were conducted on Cb—1.15% Zr alloy weldments in the
temperature range from 1300 to 1800°F for time periods of 1 to 250 hr.
Ductile~to-brittle transition curves were developed. It was shown that

at 1800°F, overaging occurred in 2 hr. Weldments made in an inert

[ x

 
atmosphere chamber were shown to age in a manner similar to that of weldments

made with the trailer shield, and weldments aged in columbium capsules

demonstrated the same properties as those aged in quartz capsules.

3. Mechanical Properties Investigations

Independent additions of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen were
made to columbium. Room-temperature bend tests showed that nitrogen,
oxygen, and carbon increased the strength of the columbium. Large additions -
of nitrogen and oxygen reduced the ductility. Creep tests are in progress
to evaluate the effect of the impurities on the high-temperature mechanical
properties.

Measurements were made of the plastic strain which occurs during each
cycle of a conventional stress~-fatigue test. The strain-fatigue curves
calculated from these data were compared with strain-fatigue data obtained

from tensile and cyclic creep tests.

4. Alloy Preparation

Techniques were evaluated for the preparation of columbium~zirconium
alloys in the electron-bombardment furnace. Electron-beam melting was

also carried out on other materials, such as Mo, U, ZrC and Al,0s.

5. Ceramics Research

One variation of the GEOM oxalate process was found to yield a -
beryllium oxalate monohydrate of fine particle size, and another led to
the production of fluffy BeO with a bulk density of 0.01 g/cm.

The phase changes that occur during calcination of BeC,04+3H0 to
BeO were further investigated as a function of calcining procedures, and
additional information was developed on the effect of calcining procedures
on the sinterability of the BeO. It was observed that lithium impurities
were volatilized rather effectively during standard sintering procedures.
Additional chemical and spectrographic methods were developed for analysis

of BeO.

 

 
 

 

Melting and quenching experiments were performed which yielded pre=
liminary information as to the compatibility of BeO with Y,03, SrO, Li,Os,
MgO, BaO, and CaO.

A study was made of coprecipitation of UO, and BeO by water vapor
from a mixture of UF, in LiF-BeF,. In some instances, 20-p UO, particles

were coated on all sides with BeO.

6. Engineering and Heat Transfer Studies

 

Additional data covering an extended Peclet modulus range, were
obtained in the study of the forced-circulation heat transfer to molten
lithium flowing turbulently in a heated tube. A line through the data

mean has the equation

- 0.3
Ny, = 1.250 03:7

The thermal conductivities of two additional columbium-zirconium
alloys were measured. No apparent distinction on the basis of zirconium
content can be made between the several specimens that have been tested.

Over the temperature range 200 to 900°F,
k = 26.91 + 0.00857t

where k is in Btu/hr.ft-°F and t is in °F.

The enthalpy of lithium hydride was determined over the range 100 to
900°C.

Design and construction of stainless steel equipment is in progress

for studying heat transfer to flowing, boiling potassium in a heated tube.

7. Radiation Effects

The irradiation of yttrium hydride and beryllium oxide specimens in
the ETR was continued. Previously irradiated specimens were examined for
structural stability. In addition, the beryllium oxide specimens were
being checked to determine the amount of gas formed by (n,a) and (n, 2n)

reactions in the beryllium.
 

Additional in-pile stress-rupture data were obtained on Inconel,

and in-pile equipment for testing columbium-zirconium alloys is under

construction.

8. Advanced Power Plant Studies

The study of reactor-turbine generator systems for auxiliary power
units in satellites was continued. A report is being prepared on
thermodynamic-cycle selection that is based on a critical review of radia- -
tor, turbine, generator, reactor, and shield design considerations. Ad-
ditional work is in progress on space-radiator designs, with emphasis on

configurations for meteorite bumpers and coolant manifolds.

Part 2. Shielding

9. Shielding Theory

Three IBM=704 codes have been completed that are designed to calculate,
by Monte Carlo methods, the response functions of NaI(Tl), CsI(T1l), and
xylene scintillators to gamma rays. Inclusion of secondary effects, such
as annihilation radiation and bermsstrahlung, plus an optional Gaussian
broadening to simulate an actual scintillator resolution, enables the
present codes to present an essentially complete response picture. The
codes permit calculations for either right circular cylinders or right
cylinders capped with truncated cones and inclusion of axial wells or .
holes, and they are not limited as to dimensions. Gamma-ray energies
may range from 0.005 to 10.0 Mev.

A Monte Carlo code for the IBM~704 has been developed that is in-
tended to calculate deep (1- to 20-mfp) penetrations of gamma rays. The
code employs the so-called "conditional" Monte Carlo method, as well as
a "Russian Roulette" technique to assist in the calculation at the longer
distances. The relatively limited data available at present indicate
satisfactory agreement with calculations by the "moments" method.

The final review of the calculation predicting thermal-neutron fluxes

in water around Bulk Shielding Reactor I from Lid Tank Shielding Facility

 
 

data showed reasonable agreement between calculated and measured results.
For distances of 65 cm or more from the reactor face, differences ranged
from O to 9%, whereas, for distances less than 65 cm, the results calcu-
lated from LTSF data were consistently higher than the experimental
measurements, with differences of from 6 to 22%.

A final report has been published covering the operation of the ABCD
code, an IBM-704 code for calculation of fast-neutron dose rates inside
a cylindrical crew compartment. The code calculates the dose from neutrons
uniformly distributed in space in the neighborhood of the compartment and
utilizes a so-called "similarity transform" feature to permit simultaneous
computation of dose for many different configurations. The Convair D-=35
code, which computes the neutron distribution in air from a unit point-
monodirectional source will comprise the primary input for ABCD. A series
of problems run to check the performance of the code gave satisfactory
results.

A study has been initiated to develop calculational methods applicable
to the design of a unit shield, that is, an aircraft reactor shield con-
sisting solely of material surrounding the reactor, as opposed to shields
in which the shielding material is divided between reactor and crew
compartment. Preliminary studies have concentrated on an analysis of the
gamma~ray problem and the design and placement of heavy materials within
the shield. A simple model consisting of a point source of isotropic,
monoenergetic gamma rays imbedded at the center of a water sphere, with
a lead shadow shield of uniform thickness placed at a specified distance
from the source, was chosen for the first calculations. The first calcu-
lations have succeeded in giving a general knowledge of the magnitudes
of the factors involved and are being extended to more significant problems
involving variable=thickness shadow shields and considering the contributions

made by secondary gamma rays.

10. Lid Tank Shielding Facility

A large number of multilayer shielding configurations have recently

been investigated. The materials included borated and unborated
polyethylene, depleted uranium, lead, and steel. Measurements included

fast=neutron dose rates, gamma-ray dose rates, and thermal-neutron fluxes.

11. Bulk Shielding Facility

Extensive static and dynamic tests of the Bulk Shielding Reactor IIT,
the stainless steel, UO,~fueled, compact core for the BSF, have been
completed at the SPERT-I Facility of the National Reactor Testing Station,
and the core and control system are being returned to ORNL. Static tests
included uranium-foil flux mappings, void=-coefficient measurements, and
temperature-coefficient measurements. Dynamic tests, originally planned
to include tests of the self-limiting behavior of the core during damaging
power excursions, were terminated before core damage was appreciable, so
that the original core could be used in the BSF. It was observed that the
self-limiting behavior paralleled that of the APPR core P/8/19, which was
previously tested at SPERT-I in the range of periods down to 14 msec.
Since this behavior can be reliably applied to the BSR~II and is well
understood on the basis of the energy model, the results obtained were
sufficient. Subsequent dynamic testing utilizing the full BSR-II control
system showed completely satisfactory performance of the control system.

Installation of the Model IV gamma-ray spectrometer at the BSF has
been virtually completed. Permanent reference points necessary for
calibration of the readout system are being established, and calibration
will shortly be completed. A test established that the weight of the
spectrometer and positioner causes only a small deflection of the beams
of the BSR building.

A crystal of CsI(Tl), 5 in. in diameter and 3-1/2 in. long, was
investigated for possible use in the Model IV spectrometer. Resolution
at 0.662 Mev was 9.2%, with a photofraction of 76%. Response was essentially
linear to gamma rays ranging from 0.5 to ~7.2 Mev. Decay time of the
light pulse, however, was about five times as long as in NaI{T1). Com~
parison of the photofraction given by the CsI(T1) crystal with that of a
similar-sized NaI(T1) crystal showed about a 12% superiority in favor of

CsI(T1), a result, however, which may be due mainly to the greater density

 
 

of the CsI(Tl). A further comparison is being made by the use of the
Monte Carlo code mentioned above.

Data analysis is continuing for the experimental determinations of
the spectrum between 15 kev and 10 Mev of the prompt gamma rays from
thermal-neutron fission of U2?2”?. The remaining tasks are those of de-
termining the detailed absolute efficiency of the spectrometers for all
energies and translating the observed pulse-height spectra into the de-
sired absolute photon energy spectrum. Calibration of the spectrometers
has been handicapped by the very small number of moncenergetic radioactive
sources which may be utilized as standards. Only Y®% (1.84 Mev), Na24
(2.75 Mev), and N'® (6.1 Mev) have been available in the energy range of
interest. For these sources the shapes of the pulse~height spectral
response functions have been fitted using six parameters. An auxiliary
experiment utilizing the coincident 4.4~ and 12-Mev gamma rays from the
BY (p,y)ct?* reaction has been initiated. The necessary 200=kev protons
are being supplied by the BSF 300-kv particle accelerator, and a thick
boron target is being used. It is hoped that a successful conclusion
to this experiment will preclude the necessity for further auxiliary ex-
periments, and data analysis may be completed. In connection with these
calibrations, the intensity calibrations of two of the high-pressure 4-7
ionization chambers used for source strength determinations have recently
been checked by experiments.

A detailed and up-to-date listing of data on gamma-ray spectra re-
sulting from thermal-neutron capture in a total of 67 different nuclei
has recently been completed by NDA on an ORNL subcontract. The principal
sources of data were the work of a Canadian group led by Kinsey and
Bartholomew and a Russian group led by Groshev. Energies of from 0.3 to
12 Mev are covered by the survey. Tables of data giving the number of
photons per 100 captures for several energy intervals between O and >9
Mev, the highest~energy gamma ray, and the average number of photons per
capture have been compiled for 67 nuclei. Other tables give energies
and intensities of the discrete gamma rays resulting from thermal-neutron
capture by the 25 nuclel of greatest interest for shielding problems.

The data are also displayed in a collection of graphs.

12. Tower Shielding Facility

The Tower Shielding Reactor II (TSR-II) has now been completely
assembled at the Tower Shielding Facility (TSF) end has been successfully
operated at low power. Initial assembly of the reactor was retarded by
the extensive fitting of parts found to be necessary to maintain the close
tolerances required to obtain the proper cooling water flow around the
fuel plates. In addition, a gradual distortion found to be occurring in
the fuel assemblies required machining and heat soaking of fuel segments
before proper assembly was possible. A delay was also suffered when
control system wiring was damaged in a small fire caused by a short circuit
in a temporary heater used to prevent freezing of water lines during
assembly.

The last major component of the TSR-II to be designed and assembled
was the control turret. The necessity, from flux symmetry considerations,
of minimizing the solid angle above the core occupied by materials other
than air and not spherically symmetric with the core complicated the de-
sign. The physical size of all members and mechanisms was held to a
minimum, resulting in a very compact assembly of control system components.

In order to assure safe initial operation of the TSR-IIL, a special
test setup was devised. The reactor was suspended in an elevated test
tank into which moderator water could be pumped from a separate reservoir.
A magnetically closed dump valve in the test tank could be rapidly released
to dump moderator at an appropriate signal from extra monitoring circuits
connected to the scram circuits, which were set at very low levels.

The calculations earlier proposed to be made of the TSR~IT with final
geometry and materials have been completed with the use of the GNU~II code
with the IBM=704. The assumptions required by this code are fairly well
satisfied by the construction of the TSR-II. The calculations are being
used to predict the results of the initial critical experiments at the TSF.

Studies continue to optimize the flow distribution between the fuel
plates of the TSR~II. Some difficulty has been experienced in duplicating
with the actual fuel elements the results achieved with dummy fuel plates.
A part of the difficulty has been found to lie in the method of flow

 
 

Si

testing. Careful tailoring of baffle plates, which proved successful with
dummy fuel elements, is expected to achieve satisfactory flow in the actual
fuel elements.

The spherical lead-and-water shield to be used to collimate the radia-
tion at the detector has been delivered to the TSF. Before it is placed
in use it will be slightly modified to accommodate a 9 by 9 in, NaI(T1)
crystal which will be used for gamma-ray spectroscopy.

Photomultiplier tubes to be used for spectral measurements have been
tested for gain shifts, and several tubes showing less than a 2% change
over the range of interest have been selected for use. A 400-=channel
pulse-height analyzer was received, and minor modification and redesign
of circuits has been performed to improve linearity and live time error.
Amplifier stability has also been improved by circuit modification. A DD2
amplifier equipped with 4=psec pulse~shaping cables has been tested both
with pulses from a Lil crystal and pulses from a test pulse generator and
has been found to perform satisfactorily.

The use of surface-barrier silicon diodes in neutron spectroscopy is
being investigated. The configuration tested employs a pair of silicon
diodes ~1 cm square, with their contiguous faces coated successively with
gold and Li%F. The Li%(n,)T reaction is used to produce simultaneous
charged-particle events that are detected as a collected charge in the
diodes, which feed an amplifier and analyzer system. The thermal-energy
peak appears at 4.78 Mev, the Q for the reaction, and the response is ex-
pected to be linear with energy. Efficiency, calculated from accepted
Li® cross section values, is of the order of 107° for 1-Mev neutrons,
whereas the theoretical resolution is 5.3%. The spectrometer is expected
to be useful over the range from 750 kev to 5 to 10 Mev. Tests with high-
energy neutrons are planned at the ORNL High Voltage Laboratory.

An automatic data-~acquisition and processing system for the TSF is
being developed. The system includes a punched-paper-tape analyzer out-
put, automatic data plotting from the tape, and a processing system for
gamma-ray spectra, using first the IBM-704 and eventually the IBM~7090

computers. In the gamma-ray processing, response functions determined

 

xvii
 

 

I
by interpolation of single-energy data are least=squares fitted to the
unknown spectrum, without any assumptions concerning the unknown spectrum.
Nevertheless, artifical smoothing of the unknown spectrum required to in-
sure convergence of the method results in a net resolution somewhat better

than thet of the spectrometer. Results obtained thus far indicate that

typical experimental response functions are well fitted by a nonlinear
analytical function.

Reactions of Columbium with lLow-Pressure Gases

Reactions with Oxygen

The effects of oxygen pressures in the range between 3 X 10-2
and 5 x 1072 mm Hg on the reaction rates of oxygen with columbium and
the correlation of the reaction rates with the formation of the oxides
of columbium were studied at 850, 1000, and 1200°C. As the oxygen pressure
was increased from the lowest pressures, the following principal reactions
occurred: (1) solution of oxygen in columbium, (2) precipitation of CbO
and the formation of CbO, nodules, (3) CbO, film formation, and, finally,
at the highest pressures, (4) Cb,0s formation. Reactions which could be
attributed wholly to the solution of oxygen in columbium were not en-
countered except at 1200°C and an oxygen pressure of 3 X 107° mm Hg. The
rate curve obtained under these conditions is shown in Fig. 1.1. The
specimen showed a weight increase equivalent to 0.22% O,, which is well
within the solubility limit of oxygen in columbium at 1200°C, as reported
in the literature.®s? The shape of the curve reflects the diffusion
phenomenon in which the diffusing species is approaching its saturation
concentration. No physical evidence of a reaction was apparent; however,
x-ray diffraction patterns indicated the presence of weak CbO lines.
Since this specimen was slowly furnace~coocled to room temperature, it is

assumed that CbO precipitated during cooling. The reaction postulated

for the solution of oxygen is
Cb + 1/2 0, — Cb [0] ,

where [0] signifies oxygen in solid solution.

The first transition observed in the reaction rate coincides with
internal oxidation. The rates of internal oxidation (precipitation of
CbO) and the formation of CbO, blisters on the surface of the metal were
previously reported to be linear.? Further analyses of the data have
shown that the effects of the oxygen pressure on the reaction rate

constants can be described by the following equation:

og 22
Rate constant = a (5 T 5) 5

where a and b are constants and p is the oxygen concentration at pressures
between 1 X 10=% mm Hg and that pressure which results in film formation.
Below 1 X 107% mm Hg, negative deviations from the above relationship

are observed, and the reaction rate approaches a linear relationship with
the pressure. Investigators of other gas-metal systems have observed
similar effects and have attributed the deviation to the fractional cover=
age of the metal surface with a monomolecular layer of adsorbed gas.

The reaction products have been identified as the oxides of columbium

by x-ray analysis, and it appears that the following two principal reactions

oceur:
cb [0] — CbO i (internal precipitation)
and
CbO (surface blisters) + 1/2 0p — CbO, (surface blisters) .
A second transition in the reaction rate from linear to parabolic

occurs with extended exposure time or increased oxygen pressure, as

shown in Fig. 1.2a and b. The shape of the rate curve is quite similar

Sons, New York (1937).

 
 

to that of the curve for the simple solution of oxygen (Fig. 1.1);

however, in this case, a protective film of CbO, forms and the decrease

in the reaction rate is attributable to this film. The metal specimens
that produced the oxidation rate curve shown in Fig. 1l.2c were embrittled
to the same extent as those specimens tested under conditions which re-
sulted in a linear oxidation rate. Since film formation occurs immediately
at these pressures and temperatures, the embrittlement has been concluded

to occur in the following three successive steps:

Cb + 1/2 0, — CbO, (film)
CbO, + Cb — 2 CbO (subfilm)
CO (subfilm) — Cb[O]

A third transition from the parabolic to a linear reaction rate was
observed at the highest pressures studied, as shown in Fig. 1.24. Rate
curves of this type are also characteristic of the oxidation of columbium
at 400°C and oxygen pressures of 1 atm. The formation of Cb,0s5 on the
specimens coincided with the transition from parabolic to linear. The

reaction which accounts for this transition is assumed to be
2 CbO2 + 1/2 0, — Cb,0s (nonprotective)

The oxide formed in this case is black and adherent.

Reactions with Air and Mixtures of Oxygen and Argon

 

The studies of the reactions of columbium with low-pressure alr have
been extended to include tests at 1200°C. At an alr concentration of
5 x 107% mm Hg a linear reaction rate constant of 6.3 X 1074 mg/cm? min
was observed. In contrast, at an equivalent oxygen pressure a reaction
rate constant of 4.5 x 1073 mg/cm? min was obtained in pure oxygen.
Mixtures of argon and oxygen also lowered the reaction rate in comparison

with the reaction rate in pure oxygen.

Fig. 1.2. Effect of Time, Temperature, and Oxygen Pressure on the

Rate of Oxidation of Columbium.

 
 

Although several mechanisms for oxidation of columbium by oxygen
have been observed, as mentioned above, the pressure conditions under
which they occur are in a narrow range of only a few microns at the
temperatures investigated. Further, although the reaction rates at the
low pressures are several crders of magnitude less than in oxygen or
alr at atmospheric pressure, the rates are sufficiently high to cause
significant oxidation of columbium in a few hours.

It 1s significant that these studies indicate a lower than expected
rate of oxidation of columbium in low-pressure air. In this respect,
the effect of the nitrogen content of the air on the surface reactions

appears to be quite important, as suggested previously. 3

Effects of Oxygen Contamination and Exposure to Lithium
on the Tensile Properties of Columbium

 

Columbium specimens to which various amounts of oxygen had been
added were tested, as discussed previously,’ to determine the effect of
exposure to lithium on the room-temperature tensile properties. The
specimens were exposed to lithium for 100 hr at 1500°F. In order to
determine the effect of the oxygen additions in the absence of lithium,
specimens were contaminated to approximately the same oxygen concen-
trations as those of the specimens tested previously and then heat treated
in argon for 100 hr at 1500°F. The curves presented in Fig. 1.3 summarize
the results of room-temperature tensile tests of these specimens. It may
be seen that prior to exposure to lithium, additions of oxygen to columbium
increase the tensile strength at approximately a linear rate (in the range
shown), with no apparent loss in ductility. When exposed to lithium,
however, both the strength and ductility of the oxygen-contaminated
specimens decrease drastically. Additions of less than the minimum oxygen
concentration required to support the corrosion process result in an in-
crease in the tensile strength upon exposure to lithium. Additions of

oxygen in excess of the amount required for the corrosion process cause

Mass=Transfer Effects in Systems Consisting of
Dissimilar Materials

Studies of mass-transfer effects in three-component systems were
continued with tests of a system consisting of columbium-zirconium alloy
specimens in a NaK bath contained in type 316 stainless steel. A system
typical of that being used in these studies is shown in Fig. 1.4.
Columbium~zirconium alloy tensile specimens were used as test samples
in order to obtain a quantitative measure of any change in tensile
strength and ductility as a result of carbon and nitrogen pickup. Con=-
trol specimens were heat treated in argon for 500 hr at the test tempera~-
ture in order to obtain comparative data. The results of these tests and
previous tests of unalloyed columbium in sodium and NaK are summarized in
Table 1.1.

The columbium and columbium-zirconium alloy tensile specimens from
tests in which the columbium~to-stainless steel surface area ratio was
greater than 1 showed an increase in carbon and nitrogen content. An
increase in the tensile strength and, in general, a decrease in the
elongation were found for both columbium and columbium~zirconium alloy
specimens. Some similar changes occurred in the tensile properties of
the control specimens, but they do not explain all the differences ob-
served. When type 318 stainless steel, which contains about 1%
columbium, was substituted for type 316 stainless steel, no decrease
in the amount of carbon and nitrogen pickup was noted. The tensile
properties of the stainless steel specimens that were included in these
tests were found to be unchanged. The stainless steel container presented
much more surface area than the stainless steel tensile specimens and was
the major source of the carbon and nitrogen. The oxygen content of both
the columbium and the columbium=-zirconium alloy specimens decreased in

nearly all cases as a result of exposure to the sodium or the NaK baths.

Metallographic examination of the columbium and the columbium-
zirconium alloy specimens showed surface layers 0.2 to 1 mil in thickness
that were identified as CbC and CbyN., These layers will be machined off
and the specimens will be reanalyzed to determine whether there was any

carbon and nitrogen pickup in the specimens.

Compatibility of Columbium-Zirconium Alloy
and Haynes No. 25 Alloy

A thermal=-convection-loop test has been conducted to determine the
compatibility of Cb—0.8% Zr alloy with Haynes No. 25 alloy (nominal
composition: 50% Co—20% Cr—15% W—10% Ni—2% Fe) in a NaK environment.
A 25-in.~-long columbium-zirconium alloy liner was placed in the hot leg
of the loop, and five sheet tensile specimens (0.040 in. thick) were
suspended inside this liner. The presence of any mass transfer and its
effect on the tensile properties of the alloy could be determined with
this test system. The hot-leg temperature was held at 1600°F (871°C)
for 500 hr, while NeK (56-44 wt %) was being circulated in the loop.

Post-test examinations showed weight gains of 0.3 to 0.7 mg/1in. 2 on
the tensile specimens. The results of chemical analyses, presented in
Table 1.2, indicated carbon transfer from the Haynes No. 25 loop material
to the Cb—0.8% Zr alloy specimens during test. An increase of 190 ppm
of carbon in the tensile specimens and a loss of 330 ppm of carbon from
the Haynes alloy were noted. No significant changes in nitrogen content
were detected in either the columbium-zirconium alloy or the Haymes
alloy. The brittle layer that is characteristically formed on columbium
and its alloys during testing in NaK or lithium was observed metallo-
graphically, but it was only 0.1 mil in thickness. No significant
alterations in the tensile strength or elongation of the Cb—0.8% Zr alloy
were found. The ratio of the surface area of the Haynes alloy to the
surface area of the columbium-zirconium alloy specimens in the loop was

3:1, which is to be compared with a 10:1 ratio in the PWAC-1l reactor.

Compatibility of Boiling Potassium and Type 316
Stainless Steel

In a recent study of various nuclear power systems designed to
generate electricity for space vehicles (see Chap. 8, this report),
it was concluded that the potassium and rubidium showed substantially
greater promise than any other potential working fluids. The study
indicated the need for information on the compatibility of stainless
steel and potassium under boiling conditions to determine whether
corrosion, mass transfer, or related problems might limit the life of
such systems.

A test has been completed in which potassium was boiled in a
type 316 stainless steel capsule for 100 hr at 1600°F (871°C). The test
system is illustrated in Fig. 1.5. Type 316 stainless steel specimens
were exposed in the liquid, vapor, and the liquid=vapor zones of the

test system.

Tantalum getter specimens that were located at the bottom of the
test capsule increased in nitrogen and oxygen content during the test,
but a net weight loss occurred as a result of transfer of tantalum to
the inner surface of the capsule in the bath zone. Tantalum was not
detected on the capsule surface in the vapor zone. Examinations made
after the test revealed a significant weight change, +2.8 mg/in. 2, of
the type 316 stainless steel specimen that was in the liquid-vapor zone,
whereas the weight changes of the specimens exposed in the vapor and
liquid zones were negligible. No attack was detected on any of the
specimens by metallographic examinations.

Similar tests of 500 hr duration have been conducted in types 310
and 316 stainless steel capsules, but examinations of the specimens have
not been completed,

Type 316 stainless steel specimens have also been tested in boiling
potassium in a thermal-convection loop. The test system is shown in
Fig. 1.6. The duration of the test was 200 hr, the boiling-zone tempera-
ture was 1550°F (843°C), and the cold~leg liquid=zone temperature was
1430°F (776°C). The total power input to the heaters was 7.5 kw, with
approximately 5.5-kw input to the boiling region.

Examinations of the stainless steel specimens (1 x 2 x 0.040 in.)
after the test showed the following slight weight changes of all the

specimens?

in this region during operation of the loop. No significant differences
could be detected in the specimens, and no attack was observed metallo-
graphically. Metallographic examination of various sections of the loop
revealed no attack of the type 316 stainless steel container. Chemical
analyses of the specimens and loop material showed no indications of
potassium pickup.

Based on the rate of heat extraction from the cold leg, calculated
from the air-flow velocity and temperature rise, the potassium~flow rate
in the system was approximately 64 grams per minute.

It is evident that loop tests of much longer duration will be re-
quired to evaluate type 316 stainless steel in boiling-potassium systems.
A second loop test is now under way with a higher boiling-zone tempera-
ture and a higher flow rate. The duration of this test will be several
thousand hours. The stainless steel inserts are in the form of tensile
test specimens so that the effects of the exposure on the mechanical

properties of the material can be determined.

2. STUDIES OF THE AGING OF COLUMBIUM-BASE ALLOYS

Aging Studies on Wrought Sheet

Further investigations of aging in columbium~zirconium alloys have
been completed. As reported previously, * specimens of various columbium-
zirconium alloys were annealed 2 hr at 1600°C (2910°F) in vacuum, sealed
in evacuated quartz capsules, and aged for various times at several
temperatures. These specimens were then tensile tested at room tempera=
ture or under vacuum at elevated temperatures. After completion of the
tests, the question arose as to what effect varying the annealing tempera-
ture would have on the aging phenomenon,

Several sheets of Cb~1.15% Zr (heat XM-339, PFYU) were received from
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Division, CANEL, to be used in aging experiments.
Tensile specimens were stamped from these sheets and were annealed 2 hr
at 1200°C (2190°F), 1400°C (2550°F), and 1600°C (2910°F). The specimens
were then aged in evacuated quartz capsules 0, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 500
hr at 1700°F and tensile tested under vacuum at 1700°F. The results of
these tests are shown in Fig. 2.1 The specimens annealed at 1600°C
(2910°F) showed a marked increase in ultimate tensile strength that
reached a peak of approximately 59 000 psi after approximately 75 hr at
1700°F. The alloy then overaged and the strength dropped to approximately
46 000 psi after 200 hr. The elongation of the alloy was initially 11%
but dropped to 5% after 500 hr. The specimens annealed 2 hr at 1400°C
(2550°F) and 1200°C (2190°F) showed some variations in tensile strength
and elongation that might be attributed to aging; however, the effects
were not as pronounced as for the specimens annealed at 1600°C.

The microstructures of the specimens annealed 2 hr at 1600°C
(2910°F) and aged 50, 100, 200, and 500 hr at 1700°F are shown in Fig.

around the grain boundaries; and specimen (d) shows some further coarsening
of the precipitate; however, 1t appears that precipitation 1s essentially
complete.

The data indicate that the element or elements responsible for the
observed aging in the alloy are not put completely into solution by
annealing at 1200 or 1400°C. Annealing at 1600°C appears to be sufficient,
however, to dissolve the material in question. Upon subsequent aging,
the dissolved material precipitates and causes the observed aging phenomenon.

Tt was suggested that the aging observed in wrought sheet may have

been due to silicon contamination from the quartz capsules used during

the aging treatments.? As a check on this possibility, specimens of the
Cb—1.15% Zr alloy (heat XM-339 PFYU) were annealed 2 hr at 1600°C and
aged in argon-filled columbium capsules for 0, 25, 50, 100, and 200 hr.
The SPeaTmens were then tensile tested at 1700°F in vacuum, and the test
results are compared in Fig. 2.3 with those for specimens aged for the
same times and at the same temperatures in quartz capsules. Although
some differences are noted in the ultimate tensile strengths and
elongations, it is still evident that the aging phenomenon 1s present
even when the silicon content of the alloy is very low. Silicon analyses
of representative specimens used in the aging studies are presented in
Table 2.1.

A comparison of the silicon concentrations and the tensile strengths
of samples 1 through 6 indicates that there is little or no correlation
of the silicon concentration with the observed changes in tensile strength
as a function of aging time.

Samples 7 through 10 show the variation of silicon concentration
with distance from the specimen surface. The as-received specimen showed
essentially uniform distribution of silicon. The specimen annealed at
1600°C and then aged 120 hr in quartz showed a high concentration of
silicon in the outer 0.003=in. layer and a slight decrease in the next
0.006-in. layer.

Aging of Fusion Welded Material

Studies of the fusion welding of columbium-base alloy sheet material
have been continued. The primary emphasis in this work has been on the
determination of the bend characteristics of aged welds after they have
been exposed to various thermal treatments in vacuum.

The aging studies were carried out on welds made on 0.062-in.-thick
Cb—1% Zr alloy sheet specimens prepared from material (heat XM-339)
supplied by Pratt & Whitney. In order to assure a standard shielding-
gas purity, all the welds were made in the inert-atmosphere welding

chamber shown in Fig. 2.4. Use of this chamber minimized the possibility

of inadvertent pickup of contamination, but it should be emphasized that
chemical analyses (see Table 2.2) have shown that the pickup of contami-
nation in trailer-shield welding is minor and approximately the same

as in controlled atmosphere chamber welding. Both welding processes
appear to be very satisfactory for the joining of columbium and its alloys.
All the welds compared in Table 2.2 were made using the same bottle of
helium, which analyzed 99.998% He.

Three different encapsulating procedures were used to prepare the
weld specimens for aging. The initial procedure was to insert the
specimens in quartz tubes which had been evacuated to a pressure of
107% mm Hg. Subsequently, however, the influence on the bend behavior
of slight amounts of silicon pickup during aging was considered, and,
in an attempt to guard against the possibility of such pickup, two
alternative encapsulating methods were investigated. The first of these
involved wrapping the Cb—1% Zr specimen in tantalum foil before en-
capsulating it in an evacuated quartz tube, The other method was to

insert the specimen in a columbium tube which was filled with pure argon.

4Tbid., pp. 3841.

25
The columbium tube was, in turn, encapsulated in an argon-filled
stainless steel tube.

Chemical analyses of the welds aged in evacuated quartz tubes are
shown in Table 2.3. The contamination with oxygen, nitrogen, and silicon
appears to be minor, and no correlation with ductility can be seen. The
encapsulating procedures and aging conditions utilized thus far in this
study and the results of the bend tests on the aged specimens are described
in Table 2.4. The data indicate that aging is most pronounced at 1500°F.
Embrittlement of the welds occurred after 25 hr at 1500°F regardless of
the encapsulating procedure. Some bend tests were made at 400°F in the
early experiments because Pratt & Whitney had reported improvements in
ductility at that temperature. The tests at 400°F were discontinued when
no significant differences were observed in the ORNL studies. Additional
specimens will be aged to determine the extent of aging at 1300 and 1400°F,
and duplicate specimens are being aged at 1700°F in argon-filled columbium

capsules.

Samples that illustrate the bend-test results reported in Table 2.4
are shown in Fig. 2.5. Figure 2.5a shows a weld that was completely
ductile; Fig. 2.5b shows a ductile weld with cracks present; and Fig. 2.5c¢
shows a brittle weld. The extent of the cracking in the ductile weld
is indicated in Figs. 2.6 and 2.7. The cracks are both transgranular
and intergranular. The microstructure of the crack in the brittle weld
shown in Fig. 2.5c is illustrated in Fig. 2.8. The fracture appears to
be primarily transgranular.

Examinations of the microstructures of these weld specimens have
shown that there is some change with aging. The change is illustrated
by comparison of Figs. 2.9 and 2.10. Figure 2.9 shows a weld in the
as-welded condition, and Fig. 2.10 shows a weld after aging for 100 hr
at 1500°F. The typical grain-boundary phase present in weld specimens
following aging is shown in Fig. 2.10. The relationship of this phase
to the brittle behavior of certain aged welds has not yet been determined.

Curves showing the time-dependent trend in weld ductility when
the welds are aged at different temperatures are presented in Fig. 2.11.
Although the ductility scale on the ordinate is purely qualitative, the

relative effects are evident.

3. MECHANICAL PROPERTIES INVESTIGATIONS

Effects of Alloying Additions on the Mechanical Properties
of Pure Columbium

Studies of the effects of alloying additions of nitrogen, oxygen,
hydrogen, and carbon on the mechanical properties of pure columbium have
been continued. The results of creep tests at 1800 and 1850°F in nitrogen,
wet and dry argon, and wet and dry hydrogen were summarized previously. t
The current studies include tests for evaluating the properties of
columbium to which small alloying additions are made prior to testing.

Bend and tensile tests are being used to evaluate the room-temperature
mechanical properties of these specimens. The effect of distribution of
the contaminant is being studied by testing samples as=-contaminated, after
homogenization, and after homogenization and annealing at a lower tempera~
ture to precipitate the contaminant as a second phase. Creep tests of
alloyed specimens in inert environments are being used for evaluating

the elevated-temperature mechanical properties of these alloys.

The following procedures are being used for adding carbon, oxygen,
nitrogen, and hydrogen to columbium. Different amounts of carbon are
added by annealing columbium for various times in an argon—10% methane
environment at 1100°C. An argon—benzene mixture has also been found to
be a satisfactory annealing atmosphere. Although both these environments
result in the addition of some hydrogen to the specimen, the hydrogen
content can be reduced to sufficiently low levels by annealing in vacuum
at 1300°C. Nitrogen is added by annealing at 1200°C in purified nitrogen
at a pressure of 1 atm. Oxygen is added by annealing at 400°C in oxygen
at a pressure of 1 atm. The oxide formed by heating under these conditions
for less than 50 hr is quite adherent and can be diffused into the sample
by a subsequent high-temperature anneal. Hydrogen is added by annealing
in purified hydrogen at a pressure of 1 atm. The analytical data presented
in Table 3.1 illustrate the suitability of these techniques for adding

one contaminant at a time.

Several of the specimens to which various amounts of nitrogen,
oxygen, and carbon have been added have been tested in bending. The
specimen was supported at two points 0.750 in. apart, and the load was
applied at a point half way between the two supports. In such tests the
specimen is subjected to shear and bending forces, and its behavior is
recorded as a load-deflection curve. The test=specimen dimensions were
1X 1.250 X 0.040 in. All the specimens were annealed 2 hr at 1300°C
prior to alloying, and some of the specimens were given this same
annealing treatment to homogenize them after alloying. The data ob~
tained in the tests completed thus far are summarized in Tables 3.2,
3.3, and 3.4. Note that carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen increase the
strength of pure columbium. However, the data indicate that if nitrogen

and oxygen are present in large quantities they reduce the ductility.

Fatigue Studies of Inconel

The fatigue properties of Inconel were studied under a subcontract
at Battelle Memorial Institute, ? and the results of that work have been
correlated with the results of tests at ORNL. The objective of the
Battelle investigation was to measure the plastic strain which occurs
during each cycle of a conventional stress-fatigue test and to use the
strain data to obtain strain~fatigue curves. These curves are shown
in Fig. 3.1 and are compared with strain-fatigue data obtained from

tensile and cyclic creep tests performed at ORNL. 3

Electron-Beam Melting of Columbium Alloys

Experimental melting studies have been initiated with the electron-
bombardment furnace shown in Fig. 4.1 from the operator's station. Part
of the control panel is visible at the left. The power supply that
delivers 60~kw d-c power (20 kv, 3 amps) to the electron gun is located
at the left of the furnace. The gun is mounted on top of the drift-
tube, which is the cylindrical water-cooled section at the top center
of the picture. A water-cooled mold for casting 2.9-in.=-dlam ingots is
shown clamped to the bottom support plate of the furnace. Molds are
also available for 2.3- and 3.8-in.-diam ingots; however, most of the
melting to date has been done with a button plate.

The electron-beam melting furnace is being used for the preparation
of columbium alloys with carefully controlled compositions. Initially,
the material of most interest is a Cb—l% Zr alloy with various amounts
of carbon added.

A series of melts was made to determine to what extent the final
composition of the alloy could be controlled by adjusting the starting
composition and the melting time. The columbium starting material used
was a 1 1/8-in.-diam bar cut into 5/8-in. lengths (approximately 100 g
each). Iodide zirconium wes added as strips. The buttons were held
molten on one side for a predetermined time and then turned over and
held molten for an equal time on the other side. The results of this
melting study are presented in Table 4.1. The results indicate the
need for additional melting experience before alloys can be prepared
with assurance of achieving a preselected composition. However, it is
interesting to note that alloys with very low oxygen and nitrogen
contents have been prepared that retained 1% or more zirconium.

There appears to be anomalies in the carbon analyses, based on the

work of Smith, * and therefore the analyses are being repeated. Smith

reports removal of oxygen from columbium preferentially by the volatili~-

zation of CbO or ZrO with some competition from the carbon deoxidation

(CO) reaction. It is expected, therefore, that some decrease in carbon

should have been achieved; in no case should there have been even the

minor increases indicated.

An electron-beam melted columbium-zirconium alloy button containing

4% zirconium was readily cold rolled from approximately 3/8 in. to
0.040 in, Previous work with inert~atmosphere arc-melted buttons in-
dicated a susceptibility to cracking during cold rolling of columbium
alloys containing as little as 1.5% zirconium.

Other materials which were successfully electron-beam melted

include Mo, W, Ta, V, U, Y, Fe, Ni, Al,03, CbC, and ZrC. Uranium

monocarbide was melted, but it showed a tendency to change composition

from stoichiometric UC to UC + UC,. High vaporization rates which
precluded successful melting were encountered with Cr, Zr0Op, and UO,.

No systematic evaluation has yet been made of these electron-beam

melted materials.

 
5. CERAMICS RESEARCH

Preparation of Beryllium Oxide

Oxalate Process

The preparation of sinterable beryllium oxide by the oxalate process
was studied further. The sintering characteristics of beryllium oxide
seem to be influenced by particle size and degree of hydration of the
beryllium oxalate from which it is calcined. Additional microcrystalline
beryllium oxalate trihydrate was prepared by rapid cooling in a silver
container, as described previously. ?!

When a concentrated solution of beryllium oxalate was boiled, beryl=-
lium oxalate precipitated that was of much finer particle size than that
obtained by rapid cooling of a solution. Also, the material so obtained
was the monchydrate instead of the usual trihydrate.

An attempt was made to prepare anhydrous beryllium oxalate for
comparison with the hydrates. Oxalyl chloride was refluxed with beryl-
lium hydroxide, but the product was merely beryllium hydroxide containing
some chloride.

An attempt was made to prepare improved spectroscopic standards for
use in the analysis of beryllium oxide. To separate beryllium from im-
purities, the perfluorobutyrate was extracted with diethyl ether from an
aqueous solution containing ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid. Phosphorous
was absent from the beryllium oxide made from the ether layer, otherwise
there was no significant improvement over previous standards. Spectro-
scopic methods are not very good for the determination of phosphorous
in beryllium oxide.

A very fluffy beryllium oxide has been prepared. When hot, concen-
trated, aqueous oxalic acid was reacted with double the molar quantity
of beryllium hydroxide, a clear, viscous solution was formed. The

solution was colloidal in nature; that is, it displayed the Tyndall

effect. Oven drying of the solution usually formed a glass. Ignition
of the glass at 700°C formed a highly expanded white mass with a bulk
density approximating 0.01 g/cm3. (Bulk density of commerical beryllium
oxide 1s about 0.25 g/cm3.) The material is a poorly crystallized

beryllium oxide, the usefulness of which has not yet been evaluated.

Calcining BeC,04-3H,0 to Bel

 

Further studies were made of the calcination process in which beryl-
lium oxide is obtained by decomposing BeC204+3H,0 in order to define the
variables that may affect the sinterability of BeO powder obtained by
this process. Samples of BeC,04;°3H,0 were calcined, in air, to BeO
under dynamic conditions. Phase changes occurring during the process
were indicated by differential thermal analysis, and weight changes were
recorded continuously with respect to temperature. Attempts were then
made to define each step in the calcination process by quenching samples
at selected temperatures and analyzing the samples by x-ray diffraction
and optical techniques.

The differential-thermal-analysis and weight-change curves recorded
simultaneously with BeC,0,¢3H,0 was calcined at the rate of 7°C/min to
beryllium oxide are shown in Fig. 5.1. The first indication of decom=
position of the trihydrate is at approximately 80°C. The reaction proceeds
rapidly to where a "shoulder" (quench point No. 1) appears on the
differential~thermal~analysis curve at approximately 130°C. The sig-
nificance of the "shoulder" was not determined. At this temperature
and heating rate the weight change corresponds very closely to the
theoretical weight loss for a dihydrate (~12%); however, if such a
compound exists at this temperature, it is too unstable to be quenched=-
in and is not detectable by high-temperature x-ray diffraction. Only
two phases, BeC,0,°3H,0 and BeC,0,°H,0, were shown to exist from the
beginning of decomposition until decomposition was completed at approxi-
mately 150°C, where the monohydrate was the only phase detected. The
monohydrate phase is stable up to approximately 250°C, where a second

decomposition reaction begins that is completed, as indicated by the

46

 
 

differential~thermal-analysis curve, at approximately 330°C, and a
nonerystalline phase appears. This phase has not yet been identified,
although a characteristic carbonate reaction is noted when it is treated
with HCl. Beryllium oxide first appears at approximately 370°C as a

very poorly crystallized material, according to the x-ray diffraction
pattern. The calcination process is completed as the temperature is
raised to approximately 400°C, and the material develops rapidly into

a well=crystallized beryllium oxide powder. The completion of the process
is marked by the exotherm on the differential-thermal-analysis curve at
this point.

Thermograms of the calcination process at different heating rates
are presented in Fig. 5.2. X-ray analyses show the phases present on
the lower temperature weight plateau to be BeC,0,<H0 and to BeO on the
final weight plateau. These data show the calcination process to be
rate dependent with respect to temperature, that is, the slower the
heating rate the lower the temperature at which reactions are initiated
and completed. Reaction rates are now being determined under static

conditions.

Sintering Studies

Studies were initiated in an effort to relate calcining history to
fired densities of beryllium oxide powders obtained by decomposing
BeC,0,4+3H,0 to BeO. The first approach was to compare densities ob-
tained by calcining the trihydrate directly to BeO at 900°C with densities
obtained by slow conversion to the monohydrate before final calcination.
To eliminate the variables of purity and chemical preparation, each ex-
periment was conducted on the same batch of starting material; each of
these batches was divided into two parts, one-half being first converted
to the monohydrate and then calcined and the other being calcined from
the trihydrate under the same conditions. In order to eliminate any
possible variation in sintering conditions, specimens from both halves
of each batch were fired at the same time. The results of preliminary

experiments are presented in Table 5.1. With batches 1 and 2 from which

poorly sinterable BeO powder was obtained by calcining directly from the
trihydrate, sinterability was improved by first converting slowly to the
monohydrate; this effect on sinterability was more marked when conversion
to the monohydrate was accomplished at 110°C than at 150°C. With batches
3 and 4 from which an easily sinterable powder was obtained by calcining
directly from the trihydrate, sinterability was not appreciably improved

by prior conversion to the monohydrate.

Evolution of Lithium During Sintering

 

In the interest of specifying limitations of the lithium content in
beryllium oxide powder to be fabricated for reactor application, ex-
periments were conducted to determine to what extent lithium would be
retained in a beryllium oxide body under various conditions of heat

treatment. The results of the experiments are presented in Table 5.2.

The data indicate that 65% of the lithium present in the starting
material is removed during the removal of volatile constituents before
sintering. During sintering, more lithium would be removed as the
sintering temperature was increased until only 10% would remain if final

densification were obtained by heating at 1650°C for 1 hr.

Analyses of Beryllium Oxide

Chemical Methods

Development work on chemical methods of analysis for the determination
of silicon, lithium, and magnesium in beryllium oxide has been satisfacto-
rily completed. Brief outlines of the methods selected are presented
below.

Silicon. Silicon 1s distilled as fluosilicic acid, H,SiFg, and
determined spectrophotometrically as the silico-molybdic acid complex?
in sulfuric acid solution. The distillation is carried out in a gold
still, since hydrofluoric acid is necessary in order to dissolve the

difficultly soluble BeO,. The distillate containing the H,SiFg¢ is

collected in a solution of sodium chloride in a polystyrene cylinder.
After evaporation to dryness in a platinum dish, the residue is dissolved
and the silico~molybdic complex is formed. For 10 to 100 y of Si, the
coefficient of variation is 3%. Samples as large as 1 g of BeO have been
used, although smaller samples are preferable because of time involved

in dissolving the sample; 0.5 g of BeO can be dissolved in HF in about

30 min under reflux conditions. The results obtained with this method
have been compared with those obtained by the spectrographic technique
for the determination of silicon, and the over-all agreement for 10 to
800 ppm of silicon in BeO is 9%.

Magnesium. The spectrophotometric method of Mann and Yoe? has been
tested for the determination of magnesium. Magnesium forms a colored
complex with Magon [sodium-l-azo-2-hydroxy-3-(2,4-dimethylcarboxanilide)~
napthalene-1-(2-hydroxybenzene~5-sulfonate)] at pH 9. The method is
extremely sensitive; for example, 1 pg of magnesium in 25 ml of solution
has an absorbance of 0.05 in a l-cm cell. Beryllium interferes, however,
and must be removed. This has been accomplished by extracting beryllium
with 1 M sodium perfluorobutyrate, C3F;COONa, at pH 3.5 with ethyl ether.
Magnesium is not extracted under these conditions. Traces of beryllium
remaining in the aqueous layer are rendered harmless by adding a solution
of polyvinyl alcchol, a dispersing agent, prior to the development of the
magnesium-Magon complex. The effect of other impurities in BeO on the
complex has not yet been ascertained.

Lithium. Lithium is determined by extracting it with 0.1 M dipivaloyl=~
methane in ether from an alkaline solution. Beryllium is kept in solution
by complexing with fluoride. The measurement of lithium is completed
colorimetrically with the use of the thoron method.* The method can be
applied for the determination of less than 1 ppm of lithium in BeO with

a coefficient of variation of 5%.

Development work is continuing on the determination of other impuri-

ties in BeO, such as fluoride, phosphorus, and iodine.

Spectrographic Analyses

Preliminary curves have been established for determinations of Al
(100-1000 ppm), Fe (100-2000), Mg (50-500), Ca (50-1000), and Si (75-2000)
in a BeO matrix with the photoelectronic spectrometer. Elements such as
Bi, C4, Cr, Co, Cu, Pb, Li, Mn, Mo, Ni, K, He, Sr, Ti, Zn, Na, and Sn can be
determined to ppm levels by photographic methods.

Compatibility of Beryllium Oxide and Other Metal Oxides

A preliminary investigation of the compatibility of beryllium oxide
with several metal oxides of the groups II and III elements was conducted.
As a general approach, the various compositions were reacted on a platinum-
strip resistance heater and air-quenched from the melt. The samples
thus obtained were subjected to x-ray and microscopic examination. In
some instances, heating and cooling information was obtained by comparing
various compositions with a reference sample of beryllium oxide, the

thermal effects being noted with a differential couple.

BeO—Y,03

A series of Be0O—Y,03 samples was prepared by taking compositions in
10 mole % increments from 50% BeO—50% Y,03 to 90% BeO—10% Y,03, heating
them on a platinum strip until molten at temperatures less than 1600°C,
and then air-quenching them, X-ray diffraction and microscopic ex-
amination indicated the 50/50 composition to be predominantly single-

phase birefringent material having an index of refraction of 1.75 x 0.05.

BeO—Sr0

Acicular, single crystals, some as large as 1.5 mm in length, were
grown from a melt of 60 mole % BeO—40 mole % SrO. The spectrochemical
analysis of the crystals showed barium (of the order of 500 ppm) to be

52

 
 

the most predominant impurity. The index of refraction of the crystals
is approximately 1.77. Lattice parameter values of approximately 9.04
and 7.16 A, respectively, for the a and b axes have been determined from
a zero-layer Welssenberg film, The c¢ dimension is still in question and

further studies are in progress.

BeO—La,03 and BeOMg0

 

Both the Be0Ta,03 and BeOMg0O systems have been investigated and
found by x-ray diffraction to exhibit compound formation. Beryllium oxide-
rich compositions of BeO—La,03 were melted on the platinum strip at tempera-
tures lower than those required for Be0O—Y,03 mixtures. The BeO-=MgO
reaction was found to take place at a relatively high temperature of ap=-
proximately 1900°C. Resolution of information pertaining to this system
is complicated by the high volatility of MgO at temperatures in excess of
1700°C.

Be0O—Ba0

Mixtures of BeO and Ba0 were made and melted on the platinum strip.
Although melts were readily obtained, no evidence of compound formation
was found. This may be due in part to a reaction between the BaO and the

platinum strip.

BeO0—Cal

Compound formation in the system BeO—Ca0 was noted previously.’ The
chemical formula (CazBe305) of the phase has been somewhat verified by
a chemical analysis that indicated 41.7 wt % Ca and 14.5 wt % Be. In an
additional investigation, compositions of 90 mole % BeO—10 mole % CaO to
10 mole % Be0—90 mole % CaO were heat treated at 1000°C for two weeks and
air-quenched. Although not at equilibrium, a three-phase region of Ca0,
BeO, and an xCa0-yBeO compound was attained that eliminates the possibility

of a simple eutectic system.

Two compositions, 60 mole % BeO—40 mole % Cal and 80 mole % BeO—20
mole % Cal, were subjected to heating and cooling and, at the same time,
were compared with a reference sample of BeO. With bare Pt-Pt—10% Rh
thermocouples inserted directly into the centers of samples contained in
platinum cups, it was possible to note the temperature of the sample, the
temperature of the reference, and the measured differential temperature.
The preliminary data obtained with this arrangement have shown melting
upon heating at approximately 1335°C and 1370°C, respectively, for the two

compositions. .

Preparation of Refractory Oxides from Molten Salts

 

In experiments designed primarily for studying fuel-reprocessing
schemes for the molten-salt reactor, water vapor was found to react with
UF, dissolved in molten fluorides to precipitate uranium. ® The stoichi-
cmetry of the evolved HF with the quantity of uranium removed from solution
indicated the formation of UO,. Similar experiments further indicated
that water vapor would react with BeF,; dissolved in molten fluorides to

produce Be0’ and would also form ThO, by reaction with ThF,. ©

The possible
application of these reactions for the preparation of refractory oxides
prompted further investigation.

Initially, helium saturated with water vapor at room temperature was
passed over a mixture of UF, dissolved in molten LiF-NaF (60-40 mole %).
The relative reaction rate was controlled by a gas flow rate of approximately
500 em?/min over a melt surface area of 11.4 cm? maintained without stirring
at 800°C. During a reaction period of three weeks, a constant evolution
of HF was observed that corresponded to the conversion of approximately 2 g

of UO, per day. Upon cooling, the reaction mixture was found to contain

UO, crystals that had the optical properties shown in Table 5. 3.

8p value of 2.20 has been reported in the literature (p. 137,
Bulletin of the National Research Council, Number 118, published
by the National Research Council National Academy of Sciences,
Washington, D. C.); however, that measurement was for mineral
thorianite which is reported to contain as much as 33 wt % of UOj,
UO3, and U30g as impurities. Consequently, the difference between
the literature value and the value in this table should not be
construed to imply that there is anything "unusual" about the ThO,
precipitated from the fluoride melts.

Oris value has been reported in the literature as 1.719
(p. 16 of reference in footnote a).

The experiment was repeated using ThF, and Bel, separately in
solutions of LiF-NaF (60-40 mole %). Examinations of the reaction pro-
ducts of these experiments also yielded the anticipated results. The
optical properties of the ThO, and BeO obtained are also shown in
Table 5,3.

In a study of the coprecipitation of UO, and BeO from a mixture of
UF, in LiF-BeF, (63-37 mole %), the experimental techniques were altered
by sparging the melt with helium to provide agitation. This modification
was used to suspend the UO, crystals in solution in an attempt to coat
these particles with BeO. Petrographic examination of the crystalline
products again verified the formation of UO; and BeO, and confirmed that
in some instances UO, particles (~20 microns in size) were coated on all
sides with BeO.

The successful preparation of pure refractory oxides by this method

will be contingent upon the absence of inclusions in the oxide crystal

55
and the ease of separation of the product from the solvent material.
Consequently, experiments are now in progress to study the properties

of crystalline oxides produced from other molten-salt solvents.

6. ENGINEERING AND HEAT TRANSFER STUDIES

Molten Lithium Heat Transfer

Additional data, covering an extended Peclet modulus range, have
been obtained in the study of forced-circulation heat transfer to molten
lithium flowing turbulently in an electrical-resistance-heated tube. The
experimental system, as previously described, utilized as the test section
a thick-walled type 347 stainless steel tube (3/16 in. i.d., 7/8 in. o.d.)
which was partitioned by the power leads into a hydrodynamic entrance
region of 25 x/a and two heated regions each of 40 x/d. Tube-wall tempera=
tures were measured by thermocouples located both on the outer tube surface
and within wells extending to within 0.010 in. of the inner surface.

The experimental data and calculated results based on the thermowell-
couple data are summarized in Table 6.1. The discrepancy still remains?
between the inner tube-wall temperatures calculated on the basis of the
thermowell-couple data and those calculated from the outer wall thermo-
couple measurements. There is some indication, however, that this dif-
ference may be associated primarily with the uncertainty in the value for
the thermal conductivity of the tube wall. The determination of the thermal
conductivities of several type 347 stainless steel specimens is in progress.

The heat transfer results presented in Table 6.1 are plotted in
Fig. 6.1. The experimental circumstances that dictated the division of
the data into the five series indicated in Table 6.1 and Fig. 6.1 are
given in Table 6.2, which shows that between the runs of series I and II
the thermowell couples were replaced and that between the runs of series
II and III the lithium was partially changed and the thermowell couples
were again replaced. During the runs of series III, a partial plug in the
lithium circuit limited the Reynolds modulus to values below 40 000. Prior

to the start of the runs of series IV, the fluid was circulated isothermally

content of the lithium. The lithium was returned to the sump between the
runs of series IV and V. The data of each series were analyzed by least-
squares methods.

Two characteristics of the data are immediately apparent from Fig. 6.1:
(1) on the whole, the data are resolved into individual groupings with an
average deviation of *10%, and (2) the slopes of the curves associated with

data obtained in each series of runs are nearly equal (0.30 + 5%). If 0.3
is taken as the correct slope (a regression analysis in which all data

are taken as a unit gives the slope as 0.38), a line through the data

mean will have the equation

Nyy = 1.251 Np.® (1)

The scatter band is *30%, corresponding approximately to three standard
deviations. Equation (1) is compared in Fig. 6.2 with the empirical

Enthalpy of Lithium Hydride

 

The enthalpy of a sample of lithium hydride has been determined using
a copper-block calorimeter. The results are presented in Fig. 6.4. For

the solid (100 to 650°C), the enthalpy above 30°C is expressed as

Hy = Hao = 32.17 + 0.914 t + (71.30 x 107%) £2 .

In the liquid phase, between 700 and 900°C, the enthalpy 1s given by

Hp — Hzo = 291.47 + 1.988 ¢ ~ (6.35 x 107°) +2

The heat of fusion at 680°C was found to be 694.4 cal/g.

Boiling-Potassium Heat Transfer Experiment

The characteristics of a nuclear auxiliary power unit for satellite
application that utilizes a rubidium=- or potassium=-vapor cycle have been
discussed in reports in this series. Because of its availability and low
nuclear activation, potassium now appears to be the better fluid.1% Lack
of information on two-phase heat transfer to liquid metals, in general,
and to potassium, in particular, prompted the design of an experimental
system for measuring boiling and condensing coefficients for potassium .
under conditions of interest in reactor design.

In order to minimize pumping power, space, and weight, it is necessary
to vaporize as large a fraction of the liquid as possible per pass.
Furthermore, weight considerations impose a limitation on tube wall thick-
ness and, hence, on operating pressure. The problem, then, is one of
absorbing heat at a relatively high thermal flux level by the boiling
liquid under conditions of very high exit void fraction (resulting from
the combination of the weight per cent of liquid vaporized and the high
specific volume of the vapor phase). A study by Dengler and Addoms'l of
heat transfer to water in saturated, forced-convection boiling at 20
psia in a vertical tube has shown that the heat-transfer coefficient de-
creases rapidly for values of the quality (weight fraction vaporized) in
excess of 0.7. This reduction results from a "dry-wall" condition
associated with the change from annular to spray flow of the liquid.

Since analogous behavior might be expected with boiling potassium,
the delineation of the region of potential burnout becomes important.

This will be studied by determining experimentally the variations in the

heat-transfer coefficient as a function of the quality for a range of

saturation pressures and mass velocities, Another problem which arises

in the vaporization of a liquid to a high void fraction is the high

outlet vapor velocity attained at low operating pressures. This results

in large two-phase pressure drops. Since existing two-phase flow corre-

lations have not been verified for liquid metals, it is planned to measure
such pressure drops in the boiling-potassium system. Further, limited
data suggest that heat-transfer coefficients in condensation of liquid
metals are lower by an order of magnitude than would be predicted from

theory. 12

Thus, the apparatus is being designed so that condensing
coefficients for potassium may also be determined.

A flow diagram of the system proposed for these studies is presented
in Fig. 6.5. Liquid potassium is pumped through a throttle valve (re-
quired for flow stabilization) into a vertical, electrically heated boiler
at the saturation temperature corresponding to the inlet pressure. The
effluent liquid-vapor mixture then passes to a centrifugal separator from
which the liquid fraction is returned to the liquid reservoir at the pump
inlet and the vapor fraction is passed to the condenser. Flow rates of
liquid and condensate streams are measured by collection in hold tanks
provided with ligquid~level indicators or by electromagnetic flowmeters;
thus, the exit quality is determined directly. Pressure-measuring devices
are included for establishing the pressure drop across the boiler,
separator, and condenser, and for control purposes. A vacuum vent through
a small vapor condenser above the surge tank is provided for purging non-
condensable gases. Two electromagnetic pumps in series are required to
provide sufficient head for circulation at high exit quality. The heat
generated in the pump cell by the electric current is removed by means
of relatively large bypass flow through the air-cooled liquid reservoir.

A circulating cold trap is provided across the pumps for oxide removal.

It is expected that the liquid potassium flow rate will range from
0.1 to 1.0 gpm, corresponding to an inlet liquid velocity to the boiler
of 0.4 to 4.0 ft/sec. Initial operation will be such that approximately
atmospheric pressure will exist at the pump inlet, and the corresponding

saturation temperature of potassium will be 1400°F. Pressures and

saturation temperatures at other points around the loop will, of course,
be higher,

The experimental boiler for the system is shown schematically in
Fig. 6.6. The boiler consists of a 0.375-in.~o.d., 0.028-in.-wall, type
347 stainless steel tube surrounded by a stack of twenty-one 2-in.-thick,
5-in,=o0.d. copper disks furnace brazed to type 347 stainless steel tube
on the inside and to a type 310 stainless steel containment jacket on the
outside. Thermal isolation in the axial direction is achieved by spacer
sandwiches of type 321 stainless steel foil and screen. Each copper disk
is provided with an individually controlled clamshell heater of about
2-kw capacity. Sheath-type Chromel-Alumel thermocouples (0.045 in. o.d.)
are positioned within each copper disk to measure the temperature at
three radial locations.

The copper disks function as heat meters so that the local heat fl
can be determined from the measured temperature gradient. The temperature
gradient can also be extrapolated to give the boiler-tube wall temperature.
Since the temperature of the vapor will be known, the local heat-transfer
coefficient can be determined. Because of the large ratio of outside-
to-inside area of the disks, internal heat fluxes up to 500 000 Btu/hre ft?
may be attained by utilizing easily replaceable clamshell heaters. The
copper disks also serve as "thermal capacitors” to prevent a rapid in-
crease in tube wall temperature as the burnout point is approached. It
has been calculated that if complete loss of internal cooling were to
occur at a given position in the tube, the time required for the tube
wall temperature to increase from ~1500 to ~1900°F at full power input
is 3 min. This gives adequate time to reduce the power input to that
particular section of the boiler. Automatic controllers are provided so
that continuous operation at potential burnout conditions will be possible.

The most difficult problem associated with the fabrication of the
boiler is that of brazing the inner stainless steel tube and the outer
jacket to the copper disks. The method being tested involves (1) nickel
plating the inner and outer surfaces of the copper and (2) joining the

disks to the stainless steel with Coast Metals No. 52 alloy by the

furnace-brazing technique. This technique requires heavy plating
thicknesses, close tolerances, and careful control of amount and pre-
placement location of the brazing alloy. Three brazing tests have been
performed, none of which has been completely satisfactory, although the
latest test showed definite improvement.

The condenser (Fig. 6.7) for the system is similar to the boiler
in that it consists of a stack of copper disks around a central tube; in
this case, however, the heaters are replaced by a water-cooled radiation
heat sink. Resistance heating of the outer wall is provided to control
the rate of condensation. Thermocouples (not shown in Fig. 6.7) are
provided in the copper to measure the heat flux and tube-wall tempera-
ture so that local condensing coefficients can be calculated. It is
anticipated that, for initial operation, the experimental condenser will
be replaced by a bare coil of 3/4=-in.-diam stainless steel tubing cooled
by a forced air draft. The rapid response of this condenser to variations
in flow of the cooling air will enable close control of condensation
rate and, hence, of the loop pressure during shakedown operations.

The liquid-vapor separator, illustrated in Fig. 6.8, consists of a
4 1/2=in.=diam vortex tube with a single 5/8-in.-i.d. feed nozzle entering
at a radius of 1.75 in., a 5/8-in.-i.d. liquid line, and a 5/8-in.-i.d.
vapor line whose opening is about 3 in. above the level of the inlet.
The circular baffle on the top of the vapor line is necessary to eliminate
entrainment of drops of liquid which creep up the vapor line. The
separator is shown in Fig. 6.9 in operation with an air-water mixture
generated by atomization at the base of a 0,31-in.=-i.d. vertical tube
simulating the experimental boiler. Good dispersion of the water by the
air stream was obtained. Separation was excellent for flow rates (based
on equivalent liquid) of up to 0.5 gpm and qualities of up to 90%.
Extrapolation to conditions for potassium boiling at 14.7 psia indicate
that, at the corresponding liquid flow of 0.25 gpm and 90% quality, the
pressure drop across the separator will be about 1.5 psi.

The possibility of incorporating a gamma- or x-ray densitometer

between the boiler and separator in order to obtain a continuous and

essentially instantaneous measurement of vapor void fraction is being
considered. Adequate precision of measurement at void fractions cor-
responding to 50% quality or higher will, however, require a prohibitively
long vapor path if a stainless steel wall is employed in the gamma-ray
path. Use of a beryllium window would shorten the vapor path required

but would introduce the need for a reliable mechanical seal to operate

in contact with potassium vapor at 1400°F. It is unlikely, therefore,

7. RADIATION EFFECTS

Irradiation of Moderator Materials in the ETR

A series of irradiations of yttrium hydride and beryllium oxide
specimens is under way in the Engineering Test Reactor in order to determine
the extent to which these materials maintain their integrity under reactor
conditions. The specimens are examined after irradiation for indications
of radiation damage, such as deformation and crystal growth, and for com-
patibility with containing materials. In addition, the beryllium oxide
specimens are checked to determine the amount of gas formed by the (n,Q)
and (n, 2n) reactions in beryllium. The relationship between the irradia-
tion temperature and ths rates of diffusion of the gas while the beryllium
oxide is being irradiated is also being investigated. For this study,
specimens are irradiated in fluxes that produce temperatures from about
100 to approximately 1000°C.

In ETR position C33H10, which is the position being used for these
irraditions, the gamma flux is 25 w/g. Typical neutron flux values that
were measured in this position during ETR cycle 18 with cobalt and nickel
wires as monitors indicate a maximum thermal-neutron flux of 6.2 X 1014
neutrons/cm?. sec and a fast-neutron flux (>1 Mev) of 4.3 Xx 1014
neutrons/cm?- sec.

The specimens irradiated in the initial experiment, as described
previously, are being examined in hot cells at ORNL. The minute radial
cracks (mentioned previously?) around the thermocouple well in the
yttrium hydride sample are shown in Fig. 7.1. Examinations of unirradiated
pieces with thermocouple wells have shown similar, less pronounced cracks.
Measurements of the irradiated specimens have shown no changes in physical
dimensions.

Visual inspections of the irradiated yttrium hydride specimens have
revealed a possible composition change in the material at the interface

of the first and second specimens, as shown in Fig. 7.2. A spot of

metallic crystalline material formed on the face of the second specimen
and developed into a deposit extending 2 to 5 mils above the normal surface
plane. The deposit fits a corresponding depression in the face of the
first specimen. The formation of the metallic material may be attributed
to either of two mechanisms: migration of hydrogen to cooler surface
regions of the capsule or actual diffusion of hydrogen through the metal
capsule wall. The location of the deposit near a high-temperature thermo-~
well wall tends to add weight to the diffusion theory.

The total radiation which the specimens received was determinad by
counting the C089 in the Inconel sheath of the thermocouple wires. The
dose profile obtained for the first experiment is presented in Fig. 7.3.

As may be seen, the thermal-neutron flux was about 20% less at the top

of the BeO samples than at the lower end of the yttrium hydride samples.
The fast-neutron flux (>1 Mev) was estimated from the flux data of
Phillips Petroleum Company that were obtained from cobalt and nickel wires
in the irradiation facility. The fast-neutron dose estimate is also pre-
sented in Fig. 7.3.

Irradiation of a second set of specimens has bsen completed and a
third set is being irradiated. Examinations of the second set of specimens

are under way.

Creep and Stress~Rupture Tests Under Irradiation

In-pile stress rupture testing of Inconel at 1500°F in air is being
continued in the poolside facility of the ORR. Details of the design,
construction, and operation of the experimental system have been described

previously. 2 The results of experiments completed since the previous

g5pecimens were stressed at the operating
temperature for approximately 42 hr prior to
reactor startup; the time to rupture is in hours
after startup.

In order to investigate the hypothesis that the presence of boron
and the associated gas production resulting from the Bio (n,Q) reaction
may be responsible for the reduced time to rupture of Inconel stressed
in a radiation field, the additional tests were conducted on two different
heats of material. Two specimens of the first heat were stressed to
5000 psi at 1500°F for about 42 hr prior to the reactor startup. Despite
this preirradiation treatment, the observed times to rupture after neutron
bombardment began (93 and 125 hr) are not appreciably different from those
obtained for specimens stressed shortly after reactor startup.

The results of the tests on the second heat indicate s shorter in-
pile time to rupture life than for the first heat. The relative effect

of the neutron bombardment on the second heat will not be known until

the control tests are completed. Specimens of special heats of Inconel
with controlled amounts of boron are now being prepared for testing.

As reported previously, 4 a program of study of the effects of neutron
bombardment on the creep and stress-rupture properties of columbium alloys
has been initiated. Designs for in-pile and out-of-pile tube-burst test
assemblies are essentially complete, and fabrication of parts is under
way. A Cb—1% Zr alloy will be tested in the first experiments. The
specimens will be similar to the Inconel specimens in size and geometry.
The in-pile furnaces will be of the type shown in Figs. 7.4 and 7.5, which
has undergone considerable development and testing out of pile. In the
fabrication of the furnace, a tantalum tube is first sand-blasted and
sprayed with alumina. Tantalum windings are wrapped over this form and
the furnace is then sprayed with more alumina. The completed furnace is
shown in Fig. 7.5.

Successful completion of the in-pile columbium test program will
depend on achieving a high-purity helium atmosphere. To accomplish this,
the supply helium will first be passed through a gas-purification train
and then into the exposure can in which additional zirconium "getter"
material will be used. Further, the experimental system has been designed
to minimize the use of materials which would create atmospheric contami-

nation.

8. ADVANCED POWER PLANT STUDIES

Comparative Study of Power Plants for Space Vehicles

The power plant requirements for space vehicles and the performance
characteristics of various types of plants, including solar cells, radio-
isotope energy converters, etc., have been studied. Based on the available
information, it is concluded that by 1970 there will be need for power
plants capable of producing as much as 2000 kw of electrical output, and
that, in the range above 20 kw(e), a fission reactor coupled to a turbine
generator shows the greatest promise for development.

In view of the wide variety of systems that have been proposed for
this application, the principal objective of this study became the
development and application of criteria for Judging the relative merits
of typical systems and their components. A detailed report on this study
is being prepared.

Two major precepts guided the study. Experience with various types
of power plant has indicated that the reliability requirement for space
power units will be extremely difficult to meet, and hence the most
promising type of system is considered to be one that employs a single
working fluid to cool the reactor, carry out the thermodynamic cycle, and
serve as the lubricant and coolant for the turbine and generator. Further,
experience in other reactor programs has shown the importance of ruling
out systems requiring difficult new materials discoveries or inventions
to achieve a short-term objective.

Consistent with these guide lines, a wide variety of possible working
fluids and thermodynamic cycles was considered, and ten working fluids in
one or another of three thermodynamic cycles were chosen for detailed
analysis. The weight of the radiator alone was found to be excessive for
gas=turbine cycles and rather high for steam and mercury-vapor cycles.

A critical review of radiator, turbine, generator, reactor, and shield
design considerations led to the conclusion that the most promising

working fluids are potassium and rubidium, with potassium having the

79
advantage that it gives a much less serious radiation dose from the
radiator. On the basis of this analysis, experimental work was under-
taken on heat transfer in boiling potassium (Chap. 6) and corrosion in
boiling-potassium stainless steel systems (Chap. 2).

Some of the more important implications of the study can be deduced
from Table 8.1, which summarizes the effects of the working fluid on the
estimated weights of major components of the power plant other than the
reactor and shield for a set of 100-kw(e) power plants. All these data,
except those for a system using lithium as the working fluid, were ob-
tained for a consistent set of design conditions, including the use of
stainless steel (or a similar iron-chrome-nickel alloy) as the structural
material. Although a more refractory structural material and higher
temperatures were assumed for the lithium cycle, it may be seen that the
turbine and radiator manifold would be very much larger and heavier than

for any of the other working fluids.

Space Radiator Designs

Design studies of radiator systems for auxiliary power units in

space vehicles have been continued. The program has been expanded to

80

 
encompass studies of the vulnerability of space radiators to penetration
by meteoroids and of methods of reducing this vulnerability.

It has been proposed that the placing of space radiator systems inside
plastic "balloons" might reduce the vulnerability to meteoroid penetration,
and a preliminary study of the effectiveness and design of such plastic
bumpers has been completed. * A detailed study of the thermal performance
of bumpers and bumper materials has been initiated, and preliminary work
has been completed in both the analytical phase and the design of an ex-
perimental program for the determination of the thermal performance of

bumper materials. 3

The results of these studies indicate that plastic
bumpers composed of "Teslar"” or "Mylar" approximately 0.001 in. thick
will drastically reduce the hazard of meteoroid penetration while reducing
the thermal performance of the radiator by as little as 2%. Such bumpers
will result in an over-all increase of the radiator system weight of about
15 to 20%.

Comparative studies have been conducted to determine the most desir-
able configuration of radiator tubes and manifolds to be employed in the
design of a radiator system for a potassium Rankine cycle for a 100=kw(e)
reactor-turbine generator auxiliary power supply. The weight of the
radiator system was considered the most important variable to be minimized,
but an effort was made to minimize the void volume and surface areas which
would be vulnerable to meteoroid penetration, since these quantities In-
directly affect the weight of the power unit by requiring greater guantities
of working fluid and providing more material for protection from meteoroids.
The results of this investigation have indicated that a promising radiator
design consists of a single vapor feed manifold with radlator tubes placed

on two sides of the manifold in a plane and perpendicular to the manifold.

The radiator tube assembly consists of round tapered tubes with two
longitudinal fins placed on each tube in a plane coinciding with the
plane of the radiator tubes on the manifold.

A study is presently in progress for determining the most desirable
materials and the sizes of all component parts of such a radiator system
in order to minimize the weight, void volume, and vulnerability to
meteoroid penetration. Preliminary results of this investigation indicate
that the optimum radiator system for a 100-kw(e) power plant will weight
approximately 225 lb, exclusive of the meteoroid bumper; it will have a
void volume of 20 ft3, of which about 10% will be filled with liquid
working fluidj and it will have an area vulnerable to meteoroid penetration
of approximately 150 ft2. The radiator system will be about 13 ft long,
16 ft wide, and 1 ft thick, exclusive of the bumper. The bumper will

weigh approximately 25 1b and will be an ellipsoid with its major axis

9. SHIELDING THEORY

Monte Carlo Calculations of Response Functions of
Gamma=Ray Scintillation Detectors

The development of IBM~704 codes to calculate, by Monte Carlo methods,
the response functions of organic and inorganic scintillators to gamma
rays has been reported. * At the present time three essentially perfected
codes are available. The first gives the response to monoenergetic gamma
rays of thallium-activated sodium iodide crystals, and, through proper
choice of a key word within the code, the results may include only primary
responses, may conslder the results of annihilation radiation as well, or
may Include the effects of both annihilation radiation and bremsstrahlung
radiation. When, as is possible, the output histograms are "smeared" by
a Gaussian broadening to simulate the resolution of an actual crystal,
the final result is an essentlally complete picture of the behavior of
a particular scintillator.

The second code 1s designed to calculate the response functions of
xylene. For this material only primary responses and annihilation radiation
are considered.

The third code, which is similar to the first, calculates the behavior
of activated cesium iodide crystals. At the present time the sodium iodide
bremsstrahlung data are being used with this code, since little difference
is expected to exist.

The codes permit calculation of the response of crystals in the
form of either a true right cylinder or a right cylinder capped with
a truncated cone. (The latter shape is the normal growth form of some
crystals.) Wells or axial holes in the crystals are permitted as a
calculational variant. Unlimited dimensional variations are possible,
while input photon energies may range from 0.005 to 10.0 Mev. Since,
as noted above, the most recent refinement of the code gives an essen-
tially complete description of crystal behavior, lacking only the ex-

perimental background and collimator effects, it is expected that this

87
code will be valuable, not only in the "unfolding" process necessary

to understand experimental spectra, but also in evaluating the magnitude
of background and collimator effects, and thus will assist in their
minimization. Running time for a problem varies over broad ranges,
depending upon choice of input energy, number of photon histories run,

crystal geometry, desired statistics, etc.
A Monte Carlo Code for Deep Penetratlons of Gamma Rays

The development of a Monte Carlo code to calculate the energy and
angular distributions, at a point detector, of gamma rays emitted from
monoenergetic point isotropic sources in an infinite, homogeneous, uniform
medium has been reported.? Further work has been done on the application
of the "conditional" Monte Carlo method to this problem, with the result
that this method, which previously had seemed to require further mathe-
matical development, now appears to be suitable.

At the present time the available data are not sufficient to formulate
a definitive analysis of the code. Some results have been obtained, however,
for gamma-ray penetrations of from 1 to 20 mean free paths in media of
iron and water. A "Russian Roulette" technique was used to assist in the
calculation of the longer distances. Initial energies have ranged from
1 to 10 Mev. The differential energy spectrum obtained appears to be in
reasonable agreement with calculations by the "moments" method.? A detailed
analysis of the code, together with its mathematical basis, 1s to be
published when sufficient experience with the code has been accumulated to

verify it.

amine the agreement between the independently measured powers of each
source and to validate the geometrical transformations employed. The
calculation has now been completed in final form, and the detailed re=
sults have been published. ©

A final review of the data showed reasonable agreement between pre=
dicted and measured BSF reactor fluxes for distances of 65 cm or greater
from the reactor face, with the differences ranging between 0 and 9%;
while for distances less than 65 cm the calculated value of the flux is
uniformly greater than the measured value, with the differences ranging

from 6 to 22%. The comparison is shown in Fig. 9.1.

Monte Carlo Calculations of Dose Rates Inside

The ABCD code, an IBM~704 code designed to calculate, by Monte Carlo
methods, the fast-neutron dose rates inside a cylindrical crew compartment
of finite length, has been described. ® The code computes the dose from
neutrons uniformly distributed in space in the neighborhood of the cylinder.
A so-called "similarity transform" feature, originally described by
Steinberg, ° is utilized to permit the simultanecus computation of doses
for many different configurations.

distribution given by the output of the Convair D-35 code for neutron air

direction. The shield material may be water or polyethylene.

A series of problems has been run with the D=35 input to check the
performance of the code in the calculation of the neutron penetration
through a typlecal crew compartment. The dimensions of the compartment

for which the runs were made were?

The neutron source was considered to be monoenergetic, either 2.7 or 1.1
Mev, and to be located 64 ft from the detector. The results appear to be
satisfactory in all cases run. A complete report that covers details of
operation of the ABCD code and includes an operating manual for users

has been published. 10

Design of a Unit Shield

The shields designed for nuclear-powered aircraft are of two general
types. The first is the unit shield in which the attenuating material
is placed around the reactorjy the second is the divided shield in which
the shielding material is divided between the source and the receiver.
Although the unit shield can be expected, in general, to be "shaped"

less severely than the divided shield, there is still much to be gained

in weight savings through efficient design. Accordingly, a study has
been initiated of some of the problems in the specification of unit
systems and of calculational methods for obtaining optimum configurations.
The systems considered utilize two basic materials: a light, hydrogenous
material, primarily to attenuate neutrons, and a dense material of high
atomic weight, primarily to attenuate gamma rays.

Preliminary studies have been directed toward a better understanding
of the gamma-ray problems and to the design and placement of heavy
materials within the light neutron-shielding material surrounding the
reactor core. The gamma-ray dose at the detector position is essentially
composed of gamma rays born in the core plus gamma rays resulting from
neutron interactions in the shield. Most of the work thus far has been
a study of the gamma rays born in the core, which were subdivided into
photons that penetrate all the layers of heavy material, photons that
scatter "favorably" in the light shield material so as to bypass at
least part of the heavy material, and photons that escape the reactor
without penetrating all the layers of heavy material, scatter favorably
in the surrounding air, and reach the detector.

The simple model (Fig. 9.2) for the first sample computations consists

of a point source of isotropic, monoenergetic gamma rays imbedded at the

center of a sphere of water and a single lead shadow shield of uniform
thickness placed at a specified distance from the source. For a first
approximation, the "direct" contribution of photons penetrating the full
thickness of heavy material was computed by assuming that the shadow
shield formed a complete spherical annulus. Scattering effects were
accounted for by the assumption that a suitable approximation is given
by the use of the Goldstein buildup factors for water! over a distance
equal to the total number of lead and water mean free paths along a
radius of the sphere. The calculation of the "direct" contribution is
expected to be least realistic in the case of shadow shields of small
half-angle.

The contribution to the dose at the detector from photons that
scatter around the shadow shield was calculated by the use of a first-
collision model, taking into account the photon energy after scattering
through a favorable angle and assuming line-~of-sight attenuation with
buildup from point of scatter to the shield periphery. Only photons
scattering outside the shadow shield radius and not intercepted by the
shadow shield were consldered; that is, the shadow shield was assumed
to be "black." This assumption is most valid for relatively thick
shadow shields.

The air-scattered contributlon was calculated using differential
energy spectra reported by Goldstein and Wilkins,*?! assuming radial
emission at the shield surface, and applying alr=~scattering transfer
functions reported by Lynch et al,l? Again, the shadow shield was
assumed to be "black."

On the basis of the model discussed above, the gamma-ray dose rate

at the detector can be written as

gla,t) = g,(t) +g, (d) +g (a) ,

In (5) the left side is a function of t only, whereas the right side is

equal ordinate values from the two plots will yield pairs of values
(t,0) which define the shadow shield thickness as a function of the half
angle. Each distinct pair corresponds to a specific value of A and the
calculated dose rate.

Because of the assumptions involved, the results should be most
realistic for thicknesses of the order of several centimeters and half=-
angles greater than, say, 30 deg. The work thus far has served principally
to give some insight into the relative magnitudes of the quantities in-
volved and to test a simple optimization scheme. In future work more
realistic problems will be considered that involve variable-thickness

shadow shields and includes secondary gamma~ray contributions.

10. LID TANK SHIELDING FACILITY

Radiation Attenuation Measurement Behind
Multilayer Configurations

 

 

During this period, experiments were designed and slab materials were
procured for a series of tests in connection with the design of the shield
for the Pratt & Whitney PWAR-11C test reactor. The Lid Tank Facility was
used for several experiments on the general problem of secondary gamma-ray
production and shield optimization in connection with several applications.

Studies of the vulnerability of armored vehicles to attack by tactical
nuclear weapons have indicated that, for an enclosed vehicle such as a tank,
the personnel hazard for which the effective range of the weapon is the
greatest 1s the nuclear radiation produced by the explosion. Although tests
have indicated that the armor of present~day tanks offers significant
radiation protection, it has been shown that armor steel does not provide
the best shielding per unit shield weight in a field of mixed neutron and
gamma radiation. Tests performed during Operation pPlumbbob suggested that
slightly better radiation protection than that afforded by armor steel
could be obtained, with a weight saving of 33~1/3%, by using a shield
combining steel with a hydrogencus material. The tests also demonstrated
the importance of the secondary gamma=~ray dose from the incident neutron
field. It was apparent that additional data were needed before the design
of a satisfactory vehicle could be undertaken.

The required information has been obtained at the LTSF by an in-
vestigation of the radiation~attenuation characteristics of materials
satisfying both the structural design requirements for the vehicle and the
shielding criteria. The purpose of the experiments was to measure the
neutron~ and gamma~-ray-attenuation properties of various combinations and
configurations of materials and to obtain sufficient data to calculate the
secondary gamma-ray dose component directly behind the shield from a unit
fast-neutron dose incident on the shield.

The fast-neutron dose-rate attenuations were readily obtained from

dose-rate measurements made in front of a sample configuration and behind

96

 
each configuration. These dose rates were measured in air to eliminate

the possible error involved in extrapolating the usual water measurements

to a zero water thickness. The gamma-ray information, which included both
the dose from incident gamma rays and the secondary gamma-ray dose resulting
from neutron capture and neutrons being inelastically scattered within the
shield, was obtained in borated water. Thermal-neutron flux measurements,
using gold foils, were made in the liquid nitrogen preceding the shield
configuration and also through a sample shield configuration of steel for
calculation of capture gamma rays. Thermal-neutron flux mappings in borated
water behind the shield configurations were included for calculation of the
boron capture gamma rays.

The materials used in this study consisted of borated polyethylene
(containing either 3 or 8 wt % B4C), depleted (0.28% U3’) uranium, lead,
and steel. Liquid nitrogen was used to modify the incident neutron spectrum.
All configurations consisted of ~5-~ by 5-ft slabs of various thicknesses.
Table 10.1 lists the configurations examined. The data obtained in these

measurements are being analyzed.

11. BULK SHIELDING FACILITY

Stainless Steel~UO, Reactor (BSR~II)

 

The design and fabrication of a stainless steel, UO,=fueled, compact
core (BSR-II) for the Bulk Shielding Facility reactor has been described. ?l
Extensive static and dynamic tests of the BSR-~IIL, performed at the SPERT-I
Facility of the National Reactor Testing Station, have now been completed,
and the core elements and control system are being returned to ORNL.
Although the data from the tests are still being analyzed, some general
results may be reported.

The static tests, which included uranium-foil flux mappings, void
coefficient measurements, and temperature coefficient measurements, were
completed as programmed. The dynamic tests of the BSR-=II were originally
planned to include tests of the self-limiting behavior of the core during
power excursions of sufficient severity to invite core damage. Subsequent
decisions regarding replaceability of this core in the event of damage
led, however, to a final decision to prevent excessive core damage and
return the original core to the BSF pool for use. It was observed during
early excursion tests that the self=-shutdown behavior of this reactor
essentially duplicated the behavior of the similar APPR core P/8/19, which
had been tested previously at SPERT=~I in the range of periods down to
14 msec. At a period of 14 msec the peak power of the BSR~II was 226 Mw,
and a very slight amount of plate deformation was observed in the inner-~
most fuel plate of an element adjacent to the central fuel element. Since
the APPR behavior can be applied reliably to the BSR~II and is well
understood on the basis of the energy model, no further self-limiting
tests with periods of 14 msec or shorter were run.

Subsequent dynamic testing was therefore done with the full reactor
safety system installed. Peak powers were held to magnitudes of less than

the 226 Mw of the self-limiting tests, and a representative fuel plate

1"ANP Semiann. Prog. Rep. Oct. 31, 1959," ORNL-2840, p. 112.

103
was examined after each test to Insure agalnst excessive cumulative plate
damage. Two=, three-, and occasionally four-rod scrams were utilized.
The performance of the control system was completely satisfactory and

was in accordance wlth design expectations 1n all respects.

The Spectrum of Prompt Gamma Rays from Thermal-
Neutron Fission of U<>>

 

 

Data obtained in measurements of the spectrum between 15 kev and 10
Mev of the prompt gamma rays from thermal-neutron fission of U23° are
belng analyzed. All the necessary flssion data have been obtained, ? and
the analysis has been completed except for the major tasks of determining
the detailed absolute efficiency of the spectrometers at all energies
and translating the observed scintillation=-counter pulse=height spectra
into the desired absolute photon energy spectrum. Efforts are being
made to prepare an analytical representation of the shape of the
spectrometer response to monoenergetic gamma rays and to determine the
absolute strength of the sources used to calibrate the spectrometers.
Since the response of the spectrometers must be Interpolated through-
out the range of important energies, calibration of the scintillation
pair spectrometer used in the energy region above 1.5 Mev is handicapped
by the very small number of monenergetic radioactive sources which may
be utilized as standards. Only Y%% (1.84 Mev), Na?% (2.75 Mev), and N'®
(6.1 Mev) have been available up to the present in the energy region
of interest. For these sources the shapes of the pulse-height spectral
response functions have been fitted satisfactorily using six parameters.
Shape analyses of the data taken with these sources at various times
throughout the experiment show consistency within the expected statistical
and analytical errors. The paucity of calibration data available in the
high-energy region has led to the auxiliary experiment described below

using the B1(p,7)Cl?* reaction.

2"ANP Semiann. Prog. Rep. Oct. 31, 1959," ORNL-2840, p. 119.

104

 
 

Determination of absolute spectrometer efficiencles requires a
knowledge of the disintegration rates of the calibration sources utilized.
In only a few cases could absolute coincidence experiments be performed
on sources measured In the spectrometers. Durlng the course of the ex-
perimental work, source strengths were "determined" by inserting the
sources into two of the high-pressure 47 ionizatlon chambers avallable
at the Laboratory. Flnal analysis of these data requlres detailed
information about the output current from these lonization chambers as
a function of source strength and photon energy. The intensity calibration
of each ion chamber used, fitted to an analytical function covering all
instrument ranges, has now been compared with the accurately known decay

198 The time dependence (on a scale of years) of

of a foil containing Au
the readings from these "standard" ion chambers is also being evaluated.
The absolute calibration of the ion chambers as a function of photon
energy wlll rest on a calculated energy dependence and on a serles of
absolute gamma~gamma coincidence experiments which have recently been
performed with a precision of somewhat better than 1% on sources of Sc4,
Co%9, Na?%, and Y88, Absolute calibrations performed by other workers
will also be employed whenever possible.

In order to provide an absolute calibration of the spectrometer at
higher energies, preparations are belng made for an auxillary experiment
using the coincident 4.4~ and 12-Mev gamma rays from the BY! (p,y)ct?*
reaction. The BSF 300-kv particle accelerator will be used to produce
the necessary 200-kev protons. A thick boron target will be placed 1n
the spectrometer at the usual source position, and an auxiliary
scintillation detector placed below the target should permit a coincidence
determination of the absolute source strength simultaneously with the
observation of the pulse~height spectrum. While the beam intensity will
be inadequate for this experiment, the data obtained should improve
knowledge of the response of the spectrometer at high energies. The
only high-energy calibration data previously available were from an
even more difficult absolute measurement made with the use of the 6.1-

Mev gamma rays in the decay of 7-sec Ni6., Tt is hoped that after

105
completion of the present experiment further auxiliary experiments will
be unnecessary and that all efforts may be concentrated on the analysis
of the existing data.

The Model IV Gamma-Ray Spectrometer

Work has continued on the Installation of the Model IV gamma-ray

spectrometer. 3

All the controls and safety devices have now been in-
stalled and checked. Before a complete calibration of the readout system
could be made, 1t was necessary to measure the effect of the weight of
the spectrometer and positioner on the beams of the building. A check
was made by measuring the elevations of points on the beams and then
allowing the beams to support the weight of the spectrometer for 24 hr.
At the conclusion of the test the elevations were again measured. The
maximum deviation observed was 0.03 in, Permanent reference points are
now being established in Building 3010, and the calibration of the
readout system will be completed soon.

In continuation of the investigation of suitable detectors for the
Model IV spectrometer, a crystal of thallium~activated cesium iodide,
CsI(TL), has been under study. The crystal is a right=circular cylinder
5 in. in diameter and 3 1/2 in. long. The pulse-helight distribution
obtained for the 0.662=Mev gamma ray from Cs'37 is shown in Fig. 11.1.
The resolution at this energy was 9.2%, and the photofraction was 76%.
The crystal responded linearly within 0.50% of full scale to gamma-ray
energies between 0.5 and ~7.2 Mev, the maximum energy available for
these measurements. This linearity of response is shown in Fig. 11.2.

Tt was observed that the decay time of the light pulse in CsI(Tl) was )
approximately five times as long as that in NaI(TLl).

The photofraction, or the ratio of the area under the total adsorption
peak to the total area of the distribution, is shown for sources of
various energies in Table 11.1. In this respect the CsI(Tl) erystal
appears to be some 12% better than a NaI(TL) crystal of similar size, a

Compilation of Data on Gamma-Ray Spectra Resulting
from Thermal~Neutron Capture

 

 

A detailed and up~to-date listing of data on gamma-ray spectra
resulting from thermal-neutron capture in a total of 67 different nuclei
has recently been completed.” The compilation makes use of two principal
sources of data, the first being the work of Kinsey and Bartholomew at
Chalk River over the energy range from ~3 to ~12 Mev and the second being
the results of a Russian group, headed by Groshev, whose data, although
it extends to 12 Mev, 1s most detailed in the lower regicns of a 0.3=
to 12-Mev range. In the considerable range of overlap, the Chalk River
data have arbitrarily been given precedence in cases of disagreement.
Where other sources of data have existed, use has been made of such
results.

The results of the compilation are presented as two tables of data

and two sets of graphs. The first table gives the number of photons

 

The work reported here was performed for ORNL under Subcontract
1216 by Nuclear Development Corporation of America.

per 100 captures for the seven energy intervals O01, 1-2, 2-3, 3-5, 5,
7-9, and >9 Mev, the highest-energy gamma ray, and the average number of
photons per capture for 67 nuclei. The second table gives the energies
and intensities of the discrete gamma rays resulting from thermal-neutron
capture by the 25 nuclel of most interest 1n shielding problems. The
two sets of graphs show elther continuous capture spectra or bar-graph
line spectra according to whether the capture spectrum of the particular
nucleus 1s essentially continuous or essentially a line spectrum. The
tables are accompanied by complete references, as well as a detailed
bibliography of pertinent works.

The general subject of capture gamma rays is also discussed; some
exlsting gaps in the present information are noted; and the user of the
compilation is cautioned that the capture spectra resulting from neutrons
of energles greater than thermal may differ importantly from the thermal

Tower Shielding Reactor IT

 

Reactor Assembly

The design and function of the Tower Shielding Reactor II (TSR-II)
have been described in detail.ls?»2 The TSR-II has now been completely
assembled at the Tower Shielding Facility and successfully operated at
low power.

During initial assembly of the TSR~II core in the pressure vessel,
extensive fitting of parts was found to be necessary, and many parts were
reworked after exact measurements were obtained of the place they were
to be located in the assembly. This was largely the result of the close
tolerances required in the widths of water passages in and around the
core in order to obtaln the water flow distribution required for adequate
cooling of the fuel plates. In addition, it was discovered that for some
time after fabrication the fuel assemblles suffered gradual distortion
that increased the included angle of each segment and prohibited their
assembly into a full 360-deg arrangement. Side plates of the fuel
assemblies were machined, and the elements were heat soaked for a total
of 86 hr at 280°F to insure against further distortion.

In addition to the difficulties encountered during assembly of the
core, a further delay was indirectly caused by the unseasonably cold
weather which prevailed during the assembly period. Although the water
cooling system for the reactor is normally protected from freezing by
built-in, thermostatically controlled heaters, the heating system was
not connected for the preliminary experiments, and considerable dif-
ficulty was encountered from freezing of lines and components. A

delay of about one week was experienced when a short circuit in a

temporary heater used to prevent freezing ignited a tarpaulin covering
the control turret. The fire caused minor damage to control system
wiring.

The last major component of the TSR=II to be designed and assembled
was the control turret, which is mounted on the top plate of the
ionization chamber gulde assembly. The control turret contains the shim
and control rod drive motors, speed reducers, and position transmitters;
the seat switch pump, manifolds, and differential pressure switches; and
the shim rod clutch manifold, magnet valves, and pressure transducers}
as well as electrical and water system quick-dlsconnects, the fission
chamber water accumulator, and the fission chamber drive rack. Since it
was necessary, in order to preserve the symmetry of flux desired, to
minimize the solid angle above the core occupied by materials other than
air and not spherically symmetric with the core, the design of the
control turret was complicated. The physical size of all members and
mechanisms was held to a minimum, and the resulting assembly of control
system components was very compact.

From the control turret, the five water tubes for the shim rod
clutches extend to O-ringed unions in the top head of the control
support tube, which runs down through the ionization chamber guide
assembly to the control mechanisms in the internal reflector region.
Flve seat-switch tubes make a union in the same area. In addition, two
5/8-1in. tubes carrying shim bypass water, one 1/2~in. tube for shim pump
supply, one 3/4=1n. tube for central-sphere coolant, one 1/4~1n. tube
furnishing reference pressure supply for seat=switch transducers, and
one 3/8=1n. tube for the fission chamber water accumulator, all pass

from the control turret into the ionization chamber guide assembly.

Critical Experiments

To assure safe initial operation of the TSR-~II, a special test
setup, shown in Fig. 12.1, was constructed. The reactor was suspended
in an elevated test tank, and water for moderation was pumped from the

reservolr shown in the figure. To allow water to cover the fuel, a

3=in.~-diam hole was left in the bottom of the reactor tank. Extra

monitoring circuits were connected to the scram circuits, and the scram
levels were set at very low levels. If the reactor power reached the

trip level, or if the reactor period became less than 1 sec, two magnets
connected to the reactor scram circults were de~energized. This permitted
the dump valve in the test tank to open and draln the water from the

tank.

Nuclear Calculations

The originally proposed®s > miltigroup, multiregion calculations of
the TSR~II with final geometry and materials have been completed utilizing
the GNU=II® code for the IBM=704. The calculations required the assumption
of a uniform distribution of the constituents through a glven region, with
each region assumed to be a continuous spherical shell. This assumption
is fairly well satisfied by the construction of the TSR=II. The results
of some of the computations and the corresponding reactor geometry are
shown in Fig. 12.2. These results are being used to predict the results

of the initial critical experiments at the TSF.

Flow Distribution Studles

The modification of the hydraulic flow test system for studying
the flow distribution through the fuel elements in the central cylinder
was described previously.” With only minor changes the flow through
elther the lower or upper elements can now be measured. Flow measure-
ments in the fuel element channels are made by injecting a "slug" of
salt solution into the water flowing through the central cylinder and
measuring the time required for the salt solution to travel between two

probes which sense the change in electrical conductivity of the water.

Times of the order of milliseconds are recorded by two pens on a strip
chart. A number of readings are taken for each polnt, and the readings
are averaged.

The baffle plate intended to distribute the flow through the lower
elements 1s hemispherical, and 1s spaced 1/8 in. above the lower central
elements. It is perforated with a pattern of 0.106-in.~diam holes. The
pressure drop measured across the control mechanism housing, the baffle
plate, the lower fuel elements, and the end of the cylinder is approximately
18 psi. Some difficulty is still being encountered, however, in optimizing
flow distribution in the lower central fuel elements. Baffle plates that
have been tallored to give quite satlsfactory results with the dummy fuel
element do not appear to yield the same results with the actual fuel ele=~
ments. Typically, flow in two or three of the 40 channels of the actual
fuel elements appears to be swirling or to be otherwise unsatisfactory.

Re-examination of the salt-conductivity measuring technique has
shown that the indication of swirling was in most cases the result of
poor measuring geometry. The technlque depends for its accuracy upon
the inserted slug of solution maintaining its spatial distribution as it
passes the two conductivity probes. The salt slug tends to develop
filaments or streamers on the wave front and gives a false Indication
of random swirling. An indication of good flow, however, has never been
found to result from bad conditions.

Since near-optimum flow distribution through the durmy elements was
obtained by careful tailoring, an effort is now being made to obtain
similar results in the actual fuel elements by the same careful tailoring
of the baffle plates. Measurements have also begun on the flow distribution
through the upper elements, but no conclusive results have been obtained

at present.

Experimental Program

Detector Shield

The spherical lead-and-water shield® to be used to collimate the

radiation at the detector has been delivered to the TSF. It is shown

116

 

 
suspended from its ground support platform in Fig. 12.3. Before the shield
can be suspended from the TSF towers and completely checked out, it will
be modified slightly to accommodate a 9 by 9=-in. NaI(T1l) crystal, which

will be used for gamma-ray spectroscopy.

Gamma-Ray Spectrometry

 

Available photomultiplier tubes to be used for spectral measurements
have been tested for gain shifts as a function of count rate over a range
of from 1 000 to 100 000 counts/sec. Several tubes were found which have
a gain change of <2% and are satisfactory for use.

A 400-channel pulse-height analyzer was received from Radiation
Instruments Development Laboratory in September. Tests showed nonlinearity
of ~5% from channel 8 to channel 390. Very minor modifications were made,
and the tests now show a nonlinearity of <0.5%. A major fault was noted
in the live timer. The error was found to be a function of the count rate,
and under the best conditions varied from 5% at an output of 3 000
counts/sec to >20% at 30 000 counts/sec. A redesign of the output circuit
of the live timer reduced the error to ~0.6% and made the error independent
of count rate.

The input channels of the pulse-height analyzer have been modified
to permit the trigger circuits to be triggered by a pulse from the
amplifier PHS circuit ~0.5 usec before the arrival of the pulse to be
analyzed. This modification improves amplifier stability and contributes
to the improved linearity of response.

A DD2 amplifier equipped with 4-usec pulse shaping cables was tested
using both pulses from a Lil crystal and pulses from a test-pulse generator
simulating those from the crystal. Both the amplifier and analyzer perform

well with the shape and length of pulses produced in this manner.

Neutron Spectrometry

A new approach to neutron spectroscopy is being investigated at the

TSF. The configuration of a detector consisting of two surface-barrier

silicon diodes? 10 coated successively with gold and LiF and having surface
areas of ~1 cm? is shown in Fig. 12.4. Typical thicknesses may be 50 to
100 pg/em? for gold and 100 to 150 ug/cm? for LiF. The circuit in which
the signal is developed is also shown in Fig. 12.4. The well-known
1i%(n,®)T reaction is utilized to introduce the charged particles into the
diodes, which are electrically connected in parallel. The resultant
collected charge is developed across Ri and fed into an amplifier and
analyzer system for analysis. Since the Q for the 1i%(n,a)T reaction is
4.78 Mev, the thermal energy peak appears at this energy. The response

to energies above thermal should be linear with neutron energy. Tests of
the response of the spectrometer to high-energy neutrons will be made at
the ORNL High Voltage Laboratory.

Calculations, based on Li® cross sections given in BNL-325, 11 predict
an efficiency of the order of 107% for l-Mev neutrons. The theoretical
resolution for thermal neutrons is 5.3% and should be improved somewhat
at higher energies. Such a spectrometer will be useful in the energy
range from ~750 kev to ~5 to 10 Mev.

A typical curve obtained from a silicon~diode detector at room tempera~
ture using thermal neutrons from a Po-Be source imbedded in paraffin is
presented in Fig. 12.5. The peak at the lower part of the curve is due
to amplifier noise, while the small peak is attributed to events in which
either the alpha particle or the triton escaped because 47 geometry was
not realized. This peak can be reduced by placing the diodes closer to-

gether and reducing the area on which the Li®F is coated.

Data Processing

An automatic data acquisition and processing system for the Tower
Shielding Facility is under development that consists of three parts.
The first part is a punched-paper-tape output which is being installed
on the 400-channel RIDL analyzer, and the second part is a Moseley plotter
that will accept the analyzer tape for immediate plotting and inspection
of data. Both these units are scheduled for delivery and installation by
June 15, 1960. The third part is a processing system for gamma-ray
spectra that is being developed using the IBM~704 (and eventually the
IBM~7090) computer. The approach taken in the spectra analysis assumes
nothing about the shape of the spectra. Assuming nothing about the
spectra facilitates analysis when bremsstrahlung is a sizeable portion of
the input or close peaks are not resolved by the analyzer. The analysis
considers an input gamma ray to be possible in every one of the channels.
Response functions, determined by interpolation of single-energy data,
are least-squares fitted to the unknown spectrum. In order to insure

convergence, artificlal smoothing of the unknown spectrum is used. The
