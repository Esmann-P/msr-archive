ABSTRACT
"If the fisslonable and fertile materials recoverable at approximately

today's cost are to constitute an energy reserve st least as large es fossile-
fuel energy reserves, about 20% of the fertile material has to be burned. This
means reactors need & conversion ratio of about 96% in the average. Some reactors
will of necessity be burners, hence the 96% average can only be obtained if other
reactors are breeders.

Comparison of nuclear-flssion energy reserves with anticipated pover demands
indicates that breeding will not be necessary until 1980. Whether it will be-
come a necessity between 1980 and 2000 depends on vhich of a number of reasomable
estimates are chosen. Ia order to keep up with the demand, breeders must have
a doubling time equal to or shorter than the doubling time of the demand for nuclear
power production. The latter doubling time Is estimated to be 5 to 10 years.

Such short doubling times will probably be achieved more easily with a
breeders than with plutonium breeders. Thorium, the raw material for “he 0? 33
breeder, is available in sufficient quantity in economically recoverable deposits
on the North American continent, but the raw meterial for plutonium breeders

product removal, and short reprocessing time, will probably reach the shortest

THE NEED FOR a BREEDING

The Osk Ridge National Laboratory has conducted a study regarding breeding
on the m2 223 cycle. Object of the study was, on one hand, the importance
of breeding on this cycle and, on the other, a comparison of the various reactor
types with respect to their suitability as #23 breeders. The importance of
breeding on the me 2>? cycle depends, in turn, on the’ importance of breeding

in general, and secondly on the comparison of the 1238p, 239 breeding cycle with
the 232 232 cycle.

I. THE NECESSITY FOR BREEDING - GENERAL REMARKS

The fuel burnup cost in a straight burner, with present prices, is about
% mills/kvh. Thus a difference of 10% in conversion ratio amounts to about
0.3 mills/kvh, since a reactor of conversion ratio B could buy fuel amounting
to 10% of its burnup for 0.% mills/kwh and end up with the same amount of
fissionable materisl as a reactor of breeding ratio § + 0.1. A bréeder and
a converter’ of reasonably high conversion ratio will not differ in conversion
ratio by more than a small multiple of 10%, and the difference in fuel-burnup
cost will thus be smaller than the uncertainty in the estimated power cost of
a nuclear reactor. Fuel burnup cost on the basis of present prices will thus
not offer a strong reason in favor of breeding.

A justification for breeding thus involves an element of planning for the
future, a consideration of the time when the fissionable material recoverable
at reasonable cost will be exhausted and the nuclear-power economy depends on
tapping the energy content of fertile material.

The justification for breeding is then analogous to the justification of

nuclear-power production in general - nuclear-power production is justified

* In this connection, any reactor which produces less fisslonable materiel than
it consumes is called a converter. ’
with a view to future depletion of fossile fuel, rather than with a view to
present prices. The long-range planning is needed in the nuclear-power field
because of the long development and design time - estimated at 15 years - and
long life of power plants » estimated at 25 years. Thus, if breeding will be
necessary 15 + 25 = 40 years hence, that 1s about by the year 2000, it is not
too early to proceed with the development now. Otherwise, we will have,
40 years hence ; 8 large installed capacity which still could be used except for
the fact that it burns fisslonable material which we can no longer sfford to
burn. If it 1s the intention to scrap these reactors before they are worn out,
they would have to be burdened by larger depreciation costs during their uses

Any estimate of future supply and demand of fissionable material is very
uncertain. Estimate of how much fissionsble material will be available y and
at what price, depends on guesses as to future discoveries of deposits and also
on how much fissionable material the U.S. will be able to import from abroad,
or will export “to other countries. Demand depends not only on the extremely
uncertain requirements of the power economy itself, but to a large extent on
the demand for nuclear-powered naval vessels » aircraft, rockets and weapons.
Concelvably the latter could even become a source rather than a sink of fission-
able material, as within the time periods considered nuclear disarmament and
release of stock-piled material could become a reality. On the other hand, some
of the uses of nuclear energy could be extremely wasteful of fissionable material.
An example for this is the "bomb rocket" intended to propel a large weight into
outer space by a large number of "small" nuclear -bomb explosion behind the weight
to be lifted.

The impact of fusion on fission reactors is likewise very uncertain.

Concelvably, fusion could produce power cheaper than fission and put fission
“4

power reactors out of business, or fusion based on the D-D reaction could be
a source of neutrons and hence of fissionable material. On the other hang,
large-scale power generation by fusion may be uneconomical, or unfeasible, or
dependent on outside supply of tritium and hence on fission reactors with
good neutron economy.

An accurate prediction of the supply and demand situation with respect
to fissionable material is obviously impossible, but it 1s also unnecessary
for the purpose of deciding on the development of a breeder reactor. If there
is a reasonable probebility of breeding being attractive during the next 40 years,
such development would be indicated. In fact, it 1s quite likely that applications
of nuclear energy will be proposed which consume large amounts of fissionable
material. The bomb rocket is an example. If there is a prospect of fissionable
material becoming scarce, the decision regarding such proposals mey very well
depend on the feasibility of a suitable breeder. In that case, any effort spent
on development of a breeder would pay off in terms of hard information regerding
the feasibility of the breeder, and in a firmer basis for the above decision.

Even if breeding were of little interest for the near future in the United
States, 1t may well be important in foreign countries with less native supply
of flssionable material. The potential need of foreign countries for power is
one of the main justifications for development of muclesr-power reactors. An
analogous areient could justify the development of breeders.

1% appears thet, for a breeder, the doubling time is ‘the more important
concept than the breeding ratio. In part this is due to the somewhat philc-
sophical point that breeding ratic is not always easy to define. Breeding ratio
is the ratio of the amount of fissionable material produced during a fuel cycle

to the amount of fissionable material burned during the cycle. If different
-5-

rarts of the fissionable material have different histories, the “eyele” is a
somewhat controversial concept. On the other hand, the doubling time ; that is
the time at which the amount of fissionable material has doubled, is clearly
defined.

More important than the above philosophical point is the faet that the
doubling time of the reactor can be compared directly with the doubling time
of the demand of the fisslon-power econcmy. If the reactor doubling time is
longer ‘than the doubling time of the demand, then the reactors cannot keep up
with demand. A future shortage of the supply of fissionable material will be
reflected back to earlier dates.

Doubling time has to be defined as the time in which the whole fissionable
inventory of a reactor is doubled. This inventory includes fissionable material
contained in the reactor core, the blanket, the reprocessing plant, ete. Re-
brocessing losses have to be taken into account.

In considering the reactor doubling time one should really consider the
average over the whole economy. Since there will be a large number of reactors
which will not breed (mobile reactors, for instance), the incentive for short
doubling time will be high in those reactors which can be made to breed.

Short doubling time is » of course, only one parameter by which to judge a
reactor, High thermal efficiency (which means high operating temperature) is
another important paremeter. A reactor with high thermal efficiency, wihich does
not breed, uses a relatively small amount of fissionable material, and, though
it ddes not convert sufficient fertile into fissionable material, it leaves the
energy content of some fertile material untouched, to be available for future
users who are ingenious enough to extract it. A low-thermal-efficiency breeder

replaces the fissionable material it uses, but it uses a relatively large amount
6m

of fissionable and hence fertile atoms, and whatever is wasted is gone forever.
In this respect, high temperature reactors, like the liquid-metal fuel reactor

and the molten-salt reactor, are desirable even if they are nc breeders.

II. THE NECESSITY OF BREEDING - QUANTITATIVE CONSIDERATIONS
The following discussion of the reserves of uranium and thorium is based
on an AEC staff paper. ® As in this reference, the reserves wlll be quoted as

thelr equivalent in Ux0g or ThOy, in units of short tons. The known US uranium

reserves recoverable at approximately the present cost of $10/1v Uz0g are
230,000 tons, to which 350,000 tons should be added on the basis of specific
geological evidence in the areas known to contain deposits. This gives a total
of 580,000 tons. Known reserves in the United States recoverable at $30 to

#50/1b of Us0g are 6,000,000 tons.* The energy content of 1 ton of U50g, if ell

the uranium is used, mounts to 5.9 x 10% Btu. If only the U- is burned, the

energy content of 1 ton of U,0q would be 3.6 x 10 Btu. Thus, 580,000 tons of
3°8

reasonably certain US reserves of high-grade ore would amount to 3h x 10%8 Btu,

or 0.21 x 1018 Btu, depending on whether all of the uranium, or only the #2,

|

is burned. For comparison, the US reserves of oil and gas recoverable at up

to 1.3 times the present cost, plus the US reserves of other fossile fuels re-

18

coverable at up to twice the present cost, amount to 6.9 x 10 Btu.? Thus ,

at least 20% of the a has to be burned before the uranium recoverable at ap-
proximately today's prices contributes as much to the energy reserves of the US
as do the fossile fuels recoverable at the above cost. This 20% burnup corre-

sponds to a 96.4% conversion ratio.

* In addition, there are large reserves recoverable at #50 or more per pound of
U50g-

** Taking into account that for every u235 fission, 0.18 of a 1235 atom is lost
by radiative capture.
T=

Hence, the nuclear energy reserves will be greater than the fosslle reserves
only if conversion ratios in excess of 96.4% are obtained. Breeding requires
conversion ratlos of 100% or more. Though it becomes the more difficult to in-
crease the conversion ratio by 1% the higher the conversion ratio already is,
it does not appear that breeding would be much harder to achieve than a conversion
ratio of 96.44,

There ere, es previously mentioned, applications of nuclear energy other
than for civilian power production. Many of these applications Bave to burn the
fisslonable material, without being able to pay attention to high conversion ratio
or to breeding... Assume that the use of nuclear fuel is divided in such a manner
that for every megawatt-day produced there is & fraction of x megawatt deys
produced in burners and a fraction ¥ produced in converters of conversion ratio C.
Then the burners use approximately x gram of #3 and the converters y(1-C) gram,
where x+y =1 (In this semiqualitative consideration we assume 1 8 of a to
be equivalent to 1 Mwd.) The amount of tatural uranium needed is

140 E + y(1 - 0] = 120(1 - y 0).
If 20% of. this is *o be burned in the process. of producing the above mentioned
1 Mud, then
0.2 x 140(1 - y C) =

or

+. 20.
yc = 78 = 0.96h.

Thus, if 3.6% or more of the nuclear energy produced is to be made in burners,
{x > 0.036, y < 0.964), the conversion ratio of the civilian power producers would
have to be greater than one, that is the civilian power producers would have to

be breeders or else the useful nuclear energy reserves are smaller then the fossile
-8-

reserves. The exact value x = 0.036 depends of course scmevhat on the ground
rules used (and stated above), but qualitatively the results remain the same
under somewhat different rules.

We also can compare the supply of nuclear energy reserves with the estimated
demand for nuclear power production. Of course these estimates vary considerably,
as indicated in Table 1, which gives the nuclear pover production in 1980 and
2000, as well as the doubling time of the nuclear power demand between 1980 and
2000. The 1980 estimates were taken from & table in Nucleonics ,2 the "minimm"
being the J. A. Lane estimate, the "average" the arithmetic mean of the McKinney
report estimates, and the "maximum" the Davis and Roddis estimate. These
"minimum," "average," and "maximum" estimates given in the Nucleonics table also
for the years up to 1980 were plotted and extrapolated in an admittedly somewhat
arbitrary manner to the year 2000. In this manner the estimates for the year

2000 and the doubling times were obtained for Table 1.

consumption of fissionable material by burnup. The demand of fissionable
material is solely determined by the inventory requirements. If the above
supply of 580,000 tons of U;03 are taken as a basis, and 100% recovery of
the contained ? as assumed, the following inventories of fissionsble

material per electrical megawsit produced would be permissible.

Estimates of the fuel inventory, per electrical megawatt produced, run
between 1 and 10 kg/Mwe for future reactors. Thus , if a fair fraction of the
US uranium supply were used for other purposes than power production, and if’
the highest estimates of power production and the highest fuel Inventory per
Mve are applied, breeding may become a necessity by 1980. -If the lowest
estimates of nuclear power production are used, breeding will be wamecessary
until sometime past ihe yemr 20003 in fact » the low-lnveatory reactors could
get by without breeding until 2000 even for the highest power production
estimates.

Unfortunately, that Lesves the question unanswered whether breeding will
be a necessity within the next 40 years and, hence, whether breeder development
nov is timely. The only thing that can be said is that there is a strong
possibility of this being the case, and that breeder development should be

pursued as an insurance against this possibility.
-10-

On the other hand, the uranium reserves recoverable at $30 to $50/1b of
Us0g are so vast that only price increase, but not shortage of power, would
occur until well past the year 2000, even if the fossile fuel supply would

run out and breeding would not be available in time.

ITI. COMPARISON OF PLUTONIUM AND U2-- BREEDING

From a practical viewpoint, the main difference between plutonium and
1°33 breeding lies in the inventory of fisslonable material and in the theo-
retically achlevable breeding gain.

The inventory is larger for plutonium breeders than for re? breeders.

This is mainly a consequence of basic physical tacts: because of the energy
dependence of ‘the fj of Pu 239, plutonium breeders have to operate at high neutron
energles where the cross sections are small and where it takes many plutonium
atoms to .catch a neutron with sufficient probability before it escapes or slows
down. A contributing cause of the large inventory is the intricate core structure
of present fast breeder designs and ‘the resulting large hold-up of fissionable
material external to the reactor.

‘The yd breeders, on the other hand, operate best in the thermal region
vhere the cross sections are large, and fever atoms suffice to prevent an
adequate number of neutrons from escaping. More important, atoms other than
fissionsble ones can be used to do a large part of the neutron scattering and
escaph preventing. Neutron-energy degradation by these "other atoms" does not
have to ve avoided and is, in fact, desired. Thus, the critical mass and in-
ventory in a a breeder can be made very low, and the specific power very high.

The theoretically achievable breeding gain (that is conversion ratio minus

one) for fast plutonium breeders is very high, values up to 96% have been
“11-

computed for small, low power reactors of this type. Breeding gains of 50%
seen to be obtainable from practical reactors, even allowing for chemical re-
processing losses, ete. For ‘thermal #3 breeders, such gains are out of the
question, n-2 amounts to only 0.28 so that practical breeding gains would be
limited to 10 to 15%.

The design parameters of a typical thermal breeder (a 300 Mwe aqueous
hemogeneous resctor station) call for about 4500 kw (thermal) per kilogram of

4 With this specific power a breeding gain of 1209 woud

correspond to 4.2 years doubling time.

The Enrico Fermi fast breeder reactor has a critical mass of 485 Ya for
300 My (thermal) output, that is 600 kw (thermal) per kilogram of fissionable
material. In the first assemblies the holdup of fissionable material in the
blanket and the external reprocessing cycle might be as much as three additional
critical masses, which would reduce the specific power to 150 kw (thermal) per
kilogram of fissionable material. If the first core achieves a net breeding
gain of 10% (taking into account chemical reprocessing losses) the doubling
time would be 100 years, that is » it would be irrelevant if compared to ‘the
doubling time of the electrical power production.

On the other hand, future fast breeders » in particular those fueled with
plutonium, may have higher breeder gains, by a factor of 5, as indicated above.
Another factor of 2 or so may be obtained by cutting down on the holdup ir the
external reprocessing cycle, increasing the gover density and so on. This
would give doubling times of about 10 years for the fast breeders. The doubling

time of the nuclear power production between 1980 and 2000 is 5 to 10 years,

F. Maslen, Editors), Table 9-9; p 508, Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., Inc.,
Reading, Mass., 1958. To the fissionable inventory quoted in the table,
16 kg have been added to allow for holdup in the "Chem Plant," etc. This
vas done on the basis of oral communication from R. 3. Korsmeyer.
depending on which estimate is used. In view of the uncertainty in the above
numbers; it is thus possible that both the fast and the thermal breeder can
keep up with the nuclear-pover demand, or that neither can. Should only the
thermal oreeder, out not the fast breeder, be able to keep up with the demand,
then the thermal system would have a definite advantage. Whether this will be
the case is, on the basis of the above numbers, uncertain.

Another important point of comparison for the breeding cycles is the
availability of the fertile materials, uranium for the plutonium cycle, and
thorium for the Na cycle. There is more thorium than uranium in the earth's
crust, but there is more uraniws than thorium in ores recoversble at today's
prices.” At some price for the oxide, the avellability of thorium mist equal
that of urenium but it is not known whether this price will be anywhere near
a price at which nuclear energy is practical.

The largest deposits of thorium are, however, in Brazil and India, and
both countries have at present embargoes against the export of thorium. Whether
this is serious for the time period under considerstion in this Study is de-
batable. The North Americar conbinent, U.S. and Canada, have about 200,000"
tons of high-grade thorium ore, which is a fraction of the high-grade uranium
ore supply but still of the same order of magnitude and very substantial. If
all converted into energy this supply would correspond to 13 x 1018 Stu which
is quite comparable £0 the whole fossile fuel supply of the U.S, and Canada.

It would cover the anticipated U.S. requirement of electrical energy well beyond
{the year 2000. Considering the U.S. alone, the known thorium supply is rela-
tively small, but this is probably largely due to the lack of interest in finding

thorium.
“13m

In summary of the supply situation,ihere are considerably less thorium
deposits in the US than uranium deposits, but if thorium were needed it could
be found in sufficient quantities either by further expioration or by import

from Canada, if not from India or crazil.

 

As far as price goes, the 3a " should at present be cheaper than thorium

because it is obtainable trom the tailings of ue? production which is needed
by users other than commercial power plants. However, the amount of thorium
required by 1°53 breeders is smaller than the amount of 28 needed by plutonium
breeders.

Both recycled thorium and plutonium are radiation hazards. There seems
to be no significant difference in the handling of the two substances.

Thus, we fail to see any strong reason for favoring une of the two breeding
cycles over the other. A strong case can be made for parallel development of
the plutonium and 1°32 breeding cycles. Heither cycle has been demonstrated
to give breeder reactors of sufficiently lov inventory and doubling time.
Gambling on one cycle - with the possibility that the other cycle would have
been the only successiul one - would be dangerous to the nxtent that breeding

is necessary.

IV. COMPARTSOI OF DIFFERENT REACTOR TYPES WOR If 253 BREEDING

Perry, Preskiti wind Zsloert investigated the use of gas-cooled, sraphite-
moderated reactors for ge wreeding. The creeding gain turned out ito be
small, if not negative, mainly vecause of the dilemma between, con one bang,
large C:U ratio and large absorption in graphite, and, on the other hand, a
smaller C:U ratio with insufficient moderation and lover n-values correspaeling

to higher neutron energies. The inventory vas of course large. With reacics

to breeding, the gas-ccoled, graphite-moderated reactors are not competitive
“la

with the aqueous homogeneous reactors.

The same authors are nivw investigating gas-cooled, D,0-moderated reactors
41th some misgivings about the absorptions in the zirconium-pressure tubes.
Liquid-metal fuel reactors and molten-salt reactors are bound to have iargs
inventories and, at best, lov breeding gains, and do not appear to be suitable
as breeders for this reason. Their high-thermal efficiencies speak, however,
in their favor, even if conservation of fissionable and fertile material is
made the primary consideration (see Section I).

ilone of our investigations so far considered solid Fuel elements with
Yeryllium cladding. If such elements were used with b,0 moderator and coolant,
they may concelvably be competitive with aqueous homogeneous reactors with
respect to doubling time. The decision would depend essentially on whether the
so far uncertain poisoning of the aqueous homogeneous reactor by soluble cor-
rosion products outweighs the poisoning of the solid fuel elements by fission

fragments.
