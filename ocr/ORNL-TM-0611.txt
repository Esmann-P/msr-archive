MASTER

INHERENT NEUTRON SOURCES IN CLEAN MSRE FUEL SALT

 

P. N. Haubenreich

ABSTRACT

 

 

 

Unirradiated MSRE fuel salt will contain an
appreciable neutron source due to spontaneous
fission of the uranium, and (a, n) reactions of
alpha particles from the uranium with the fluo-
rine and beryllium of the salt. The spontaneous
fission source in the core (25 f£t3 of salt) is
102 neutrons/sec. or less, mostly from U238. The
alpha-n source is much larger, giving about 4 x 105
neutrons/sec. in the core. Nearly all of this

latter source is caused by alpha particles from
Usse,

Introduction

When a reacvor is subcritical, the fission rate and the neutron flux
depend on the strength of the neutron source in the reactor due to various
reactions and the multiplication of these source neutrons by fissions in
the core. By supporting the fission rate in the subcritical reactor at
sufficiently high levels, a source performs several functions in reactor
operations. The source strength required for some functions is higher
than for others.

In all reactor fuels there is always a source of neutrons due to
spontaneous fission, but this source is relatively weak, particularly if
the fuel is highly enriched uranium. In many reactor cores there is also
an inherent photoneutron source produced by interaction of gamma rays with
deuterium or beryllium in the core. This source is usually not significant,
however, until after fission product gamma sources have been built up by
power operation. Therefore, in nearly all reactors an extraneous neutron
source is inserted in or near the core. The MSRE is unusual in that the
fuel is a homogeneous fused salt in which alpha-emitting uranium is inti-
mately dispersed with large quantities of fluorine and beryllium,both of
which readily undergo alpha-n reactions. Thus there is a strong alpha-n
source lnherent in the MSRE fuel salt even before it has been irradiated.

It is conceivable that the source inherent in the MSRE fuel salt,
which is certain to be present whenever there is any chance of criticality,
is strong enough. to satisfy some, if not all, of the requirements which
make an extraneous source necessary in most reactors. In determining
whether or not an extraneous source is required, it is necessary to pre-
dict the strength of the neutron source which is inherent in the clean
slat before the photoneutron source becomes important. The present report
describes this prediction. The question of source requirements will be

considered later, in a separate report.

Fuel Composition

The strength of the inherent neutron source depends on the composition

of the fuel salt and the isotopic composition of the uranium in it. Three
fuel salts, with compositions shown in Table 1, have been considered for
the MSRE.

Uranium concentrations shown are for the initial critical experiment.
For power operation the uranium concentration will be higher by about 15%
(to compensate for control rods, xenon and other poisons).

The isotopic compositions shown for the uranium are the values used
in the criticality calculations. The U23% and U®3® fractions are based on
typical analyses of uranium enriched in the diffusion plant to the indicated
U235 content.

The lithium composition is that of lithium actually on hand for fuel

salt manufacture.

Spontaneous Fission Neutrons

 

The rate of neutron production by spontaneous fission is a specific
property of the each nuclide. In the clean MSRE fuel, UZ3® has the shortest

half-life for spontaneous fission. (See Table 2.)

Neutrons From Alpha-n Reactions

Energetic alpha particles can produce neutrons by nuclear interactions
with several different nuclides. Threshold energies vary widely, depending
upon the nuclide. Three nuclides, Li7, Be® and F'®, have Q-n thresholds
below the maximum energy of alphas from uranium. The neutron yield per
alpha particle is a function of the initial energy of the alpha particle

and the composition of the medium in which it is slowing down.
Alpha Emission by Uranium

 

Among the uranium isotopes present in fresh MSRE fuel, U234 has by
far the highest specific alpha emission and also emits the highest-energy
alpha particles. The specific alpha sources are summarized in Table yr
Table 5 gives the total alpha source in the effective core of the MSRE
during the initial critical experiment (25 £t2 of salt, containing the

amounts of uranium shown in Table 3).

Alpha-n Yields in Fuel Salt

The yields of neutrons from Be®, F®, and Li” vary with the energy of
the alpha-particle, generally increasing with energy. Yields for 4.77-Mev
alpha-particles in thick targets of pure material are 40, 6 and 0.1 neutrons
per million alpha-particles in beryllium, fluorine, and lithium-7, respec-
tively. In the MSRE fuel salt, the productive nuclides comprise only a
fraction of the total, and the yield is affected by the dilution with other
elements. Yields for alpha-particles of each energy in Table 5, in each
of three fuel salts, were calculated by procedures described in the Appendix.
Table 6 illustrates how beryllium, fluorine, and lithium contribute to the
total yield for the most numerous and highest-energy group of alpha parti-

cles.

Discussion

The calculations indicate that the bulk of the neutron source inherent
in the clean MSRE fuel is due to alpha-n reactions, with spontaneous fis-
sion contributing relatively little. Furthermore, about 97 percent of the
neutron source is caused by alpha particles from a single isotope, UZ3%,
which comprises a very small fraction of the total uranium. Therefore, the
neutron source will be very closely proportional to the U23%* content of the
fuel salt.

In natural uranium, the abundance of U23% is only 0.0057%, or 0.0079
of the U235 abundance. In a gaseous diffusion plant, however, the U=3%/y=35
ratio is increased, so that in uranium containing over 90% UZ3S the
U234 /U235 ratio is 0.010 or above.

The U23% fractions which were used in the calculations are based on
typical analyses of enriched uranium, and thus are only estimates of what
will appear in uranium which will be used in making up the MSRE fuel salt.
The estimate is probably good to within 20% in the case of Fuels A and B,
which use highly enriched uranium. In the case of Fuel C it was assumed

that the uranium would be taken from the diffusion plant at about 35% Us3s,
11

and that the U23% content would be only 0.30%. It now appears that the

uranium may be added to the MSRE fuel salt in two batches: the first of
natural or depleted uranium; the second, highly enriched. If this course
is followed, the U23* content of Fuel C would probably be higher, perhaps
by as much as a factor of 1.4. The neutron source for Fuel C would then

be higher by the same factor.

APPENDIX
Calculation of Alpha-n Yields in MSRE Fuel Salt

Information on alpha-n yields from various nuclides usually appears
in one of two forms: 1) the microscopic cross section of the nuclide for
the a-n reaction as a function of alpha energy, or 2) the yield of neutrons
per million alphas particles of a given initial energy emitted in an infi-
nite medium of the pure nuclide. If the alpha particles are emitted in a
mixture, it is necessary to take into account the dilution of the produc-

tive nuclides by others which only slow down the alpha particles.

Dilution by Non-Productive Constituents of Fuel Salt

The correction for the dilution of a productive nuclide in a mixture
is essentially the fraction of the alpha energy loss which is attributable
to the productive constituent.

Let Dax be the yield of neutrons for alpha particles emitted in an
infinite medium consisting entirely of a productive nuclide. Let n be the
yield for that nuclide in a mixture. It has been observed®’® that a fairly

good approximation is

 

n LL 5

where S is the "relative atomic stopping power", N is the number density
of a nuclide, and p refers to the productive constituent.

The best information on relative stopping powers is still a 1937
article by Livingston and Bethe .* They give S relative to air for 16
elements for 6-Mev alpha-particles and for 6 elements at 7 other energies
from 2 to 52 Mev. Table 8 gives values of S for the constituents of the
MSRE fuel salt, obtained by interpolation in energy and atomic number of
the Livingston - Bethe data. The relative stopping powers in this table
are evaluated at 4.5 Mev, because this is approximately the energy of the

uranium alpha-particles.

Segre and Wiegand® measured neutron yields for alpha particles of

Table 8, n/n. for Fuels A, B and C are 0.692, 0.705 and 0.699. The pro-

cross-section rises to 8 mb at 4.8 Mev, then decreases to about 6 mb at
higher energies. Hess' cross-section was used to compute yields from Li”
in the fuel salt from equations (2) and (3). The integral in Eq. (2) was
evaluated by representing the cross section curve by straight-line segments
snd by approximating —- = a vs. E by linear relations fitted to
points at 4 and 5 Mev given in Table 9. Results appear in Table 10.
