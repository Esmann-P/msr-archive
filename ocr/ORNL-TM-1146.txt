PRODUCTION OF A LOW-BORON HEAT OF HASTELLOY N

W. R. Martin, H. E. McCoy, and J. R. Weir

Current mechanisms for the irradiation embrittlement of structural
alloys at elevated temperature are generally associated with the produc-
tion of helium by (n,Q) reactions. In most reactor environments the
helium is generated from the transmutation of 108, Boron is generally
present in nickel-base alloys at concentrations in the range of 5 to |
80 ppm by weight. These concentrations are above those that have been
observed to produce deleterious quantities of helium in stainless steels.

The Stellite Division of Union Carbide has melted a '75-1b heat of
Hastelloy N, using a practice designed to produce low residuals of boron,
oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, silicon, and sulfur. This vacuum-induction
heat, designated heat 65-552, was melted using an alumina crucible. Since
no deliberate additions of boron were made in the melting practice, analy-
sis of the final heat and the raw materials should lead to discovery of
the source of boron in the alloy. These data are given in Table 1. The
concentration of boron is much less than the normal 5 to 80 ppm. It is
apparent that most of the boron was not introduced into the alloy from
the raw materials listed in Table 1. Approximately 84% of the boron in
the ingot was introduced by some other means. There are perhaps several
other sources but a prime suspect is the alumina crucible. Future work
should help define further the probable sources of boron.

It has been demonstrated that a heat of Hastelloy N can be produced
in 50 to 75-1b ingot sizes that contain substantially lower quantities of
boron than is normally found in these grades of material. It therefore
seems probable that larger ingots in the range of 10,000 1b can also be
produced which could offer improved properties for reactor application at

elevated temperatures.
