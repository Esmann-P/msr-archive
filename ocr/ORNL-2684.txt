MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR PROGRAM QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT
SUMMARY
PART 1. REACTOR DESIGN STUDIES
1.1. CONCEPTUAL DESIGN STUDIES AND NUCLEAR CALCULATIONS

A design study is being made of & 30«Mw, one-region, experimental,
molten-salt reactor. A power plant arrangement has been developed that
is based on febricability and maintenance considerations. Designs have
been prepared of & fuel sampling and enriching mechanism, system pre-
heating devices, and off-gas system valves,

A preliminary design and cost-estimate study has been completed on
a 315-Mw (e) graphite-moderated molten-galt power reactor. In this
resctor the molten-salt fuel flows through holes in the cylindrical,
unclad, graphite moderator, which is contained in en INOR-8 vessel.

The lov-enrichment (1.30% UPS, initislly) fuel mixture is LiFBeF,-
UF), (70-10-20 mole %).

Nuclear calculations relative to the experimental reactor have been
completed in which the reactivity effects of various modifications were
evaluated. It was estimated that the experimental reactor would have an
over=all temperature coefficient of reactivity of 6.75 x 10 >
(8x/x) [oF

The effect of neutron and goma-Tay activity in the secondary

heat exchanger of the interim. design reactor of using the salt mixture
_LiF-BeF,, (63-37 mole 9) as “the coolant, in place of sodium, has been

oe studied. “It was found that ‘the gamma-ray ‘dose would be only one~half
that ‘expected from: ‘sodium, ‘and that no epprecisble neutron activity

vould be present.

 
 

 

The nuclear effects of processing molten-salt fuels to remove the
rare-earth fission products by ion exchange with CeFy have been investi-
gated. A comparison with performance of the system utilizing the

fluoride-volatility processing method showed that the ion-exchange

method gives 50% lower average critical inventory and a 30% lower:

cumulative net burnup.
Modifications have been made to the Oracle programs ‘Cornpone and

Sorghum to permit evaluations of heterogeneous reactors, and Oracle

program GHIMSR has been written to expedite heating calculations. Follow-
ing test calculations with the modified programs, initial and long-term

nuclear performance calculations were made for two-low-enrichment, one-
region, graphite-moderated, unreflected, molten-salt reactors. The
results indicate the effect of adding thorium to the fuel mixture. The
fuel used in one calculation was LiF-BeF,-UF), (70<10-20 mole %), as
described above, and in the other the fuel was LiF-BeF,-ThF) (67-16-13
mole $) plus sufficient 3%, P3%, to make the system critical. For
a cumulative power generation of T7200 Mwy, the critical inventory with-
out thorium was 4386 kg and, with thorium, was 1416 kg. The cumulative
net burnup without thorium was 1400 kg, and, with thorium, vas 1083 kg.
Calculations of the performance of a thoriumecontaining graphite-
moderated and -reflected system were initiated.

1.2. COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING

Investigations have been continued of salt-lubricated bearings
for molten-salt pumps. Bearing and Journal parts fabricated of INOR-8
are being subjected to numerous tests to determine optimum design and
operating conditions. Equipment for testing galt-lubricated thrust
bearings was designed and construction is nearly complete. A PK type
of centrifugal pump is being prepared for service tests of molten-salt
lubricated bearings. | The favorable results being obtained with these

bearings have resulted in the postponement of tests of the more complicated
hydrostatic type of bearing. |

The modified Fulton-Sylphon bellows-mounted seal peing subjected to
an endurance test in a PK-P type of centrifugal pump has continued to
seal satisfactorily for more than 10,000 hr of operation. . Operation of
an MF type of centrifugal pump with fuel 30 as the circulated fluid has
continued to be satisfactory through more than 13,500 hr, with the past
11,500 hr of operation being under cavitation damage conditions.

A small frozen-lead pump seal on a 3/16-in.-dia shaft has operated
since the first 100 hr of almost 5000 hr of operation with no lead
leakage. Test operation of a similar seal on & 3 1/4-in.~dia shaft has
been initiated.

Techniques for remote maintenance of the reactor system have been
investigated further. Specifically, improvements were made in the
freeze-flange Joints being developed for remote connection of molten=-
salt and sodium lines. Construction work continued on the remote-mainte-
nance demonstration facility.

Equipment for salt-to-galt heat transfer tests has been completed.
Date are being obtained with which to determine heat transfer coefficients.
A heat exchanger has been designed with which to evaluate triplex
tubing for use in molten-salt or liquid metel-to-steam superheater appli-
cations. A small ‘heat exchanger test stand will be modified for testing

of the ‘heat exchanger. - Lo ER

Further tests of commercial expansion Joints in molten-salt lines
have demonstrated conclusively that such Joints are not suiteble. Typical

failuesindicated, Bovever, a highestress point that could be eliminated

Operation of forced-circulation corrosion-testing loops hag been

evhviniet, and most of the 15 loops have been modified. to prevent freeze-

ups of the salts being circulated. .

 
 

-Vi =

Operation of the first in-pile loop was started at the MIR on
December 3, 1958 and had continued satisfactorily through 860 hr, when
it was shut down because of the leakage of fission gases. The radiation
release has been traced to a partially plugged pump-sump purge-outlet
line which caused fission gases to back-diffuse up the pump-suwp -purge-
inlet line to a point outside the cubicle, where they escaped through
a leak. oo . I
The assembly of an improved in-pile loop is approximately 60%

complete.
1.3. ENGINEERING RESEARCH

Modifications in the design of the capillary efflux viscometers
and in the method of calibration have led to more precise data on the
viscosities of the salt mixtures LiF-BeF,-UF) (6237-1 mole %) and
LiF -BeF,-UF) -ThF), (62-36.5-0.5-1 mole 4). At the lower temperatures
the viscosities are significantly lower than those previously reported.
The solid-phase enthalpies and heats of fusion have been obtained for
three LiCl-KCl mixtures.

Fabrication, assembly, and initial calibrations are continuing on

 

components for the forcedscirculation loop designed to ascertain the
presence and effect of interfacial thermal resistances in systems :¢ire
culating BeF,-containing salts. Heat-transfer coefficient measurements
will be made as a means of studying surface film formation.

for 1000 hr have been completed. Anomalous results were obtained that-
are largely attributable to impurities in the circulated salt mixtures.
No forced-circulation loop tests were completed during the quarter. }

Mechanicel property tests have been made on Inconel and INOR-8 specie
mens that were carburized by exposure for 4000 hr at 1200°F in a system
containing sodium and graphite. Carburization was found to decrease the
tensile strength and elongation of INOR-8. On the other hand, carburi-
zation increased the tensile and yield strengths of Inconel and decreased
the elongation. The results of chemical analyses of the specimens were used
to establish relationships of carbon content vs distance from specimen
surfece for various time intervals.

Similar specimens exposed for LOO hr to sodium containing graphite
shoved no evidence of carburization. Specimens of Inconel end INOR-8
were also exposed at 1300°F to fuel 130 containing graphite for 2000
end 4000 hr. The Inconel specimens were attacked and showed reductions
in mechanical strength. The INOR-8 specimens showed no carburization
and only slight attack after 4000 hr.

Further tests have been made in the study of the compatibility of
graphite and molten-galt mixtures. Uranium oxide precipitation has
occurred in all tests with fuel 130. The quantity of uranium precipitated
appears to be an indirect function of the purity of the graphite. Attempts
are being made to eliminate the precipitation by using purer graphite.
Tests are also under way to investigate the penetration of graphite by
fuel mixtures as a function of time, temperature, and pressure.

The strength properties of INOR-8 at high temperatures ere being
investigated in tensile, creep, Telaxation, and fatigue tests. Prelimi-
nary date indicate that the creep. ‘properties in molten salts at 1200°F

are the same ag ‘those in air, Teste of notch sensitivity. ‘have. ‘indicated
that INOR-8 is notch ‘strengthened. at ‘room-temperature and at 1500°F .

Rotating-beam fatigue studies are being conducted under subcontract at
Battelle Memorial Institute. So oo

Fabrication and welding and brazing studies are being made of triplex-
tube heat exchangers. The tubing consists of two concentric tubes with
a porous-metal-filled annulus. Means are being sought for obtaining good
conductivity across the annulus and adequate permeability of helium through
the porous metal for leak detection. Prefabricated porous materials are
being obtained from commercial sources for evaluation, - Co

Studies of composites of INOR-8 and type 316 stainless steel have
shown the alloys Yo be compatible at temperatures up to 1800°F. Such
composites therefore appear to be promising for use in fused salt-to-
sodium heat exchangers.
Various means for deoxidizing and purifying ingots of INOR-8 weld
metal have been studied as means for improving the ductility of INOR-8
weldments. The ductility at 1500°F has been increased from an average
of 7% to 13 to 15%, and further improvements are thought to be possible.
No increase in high-temperature ductility was obtained by decreasing
the carbon content.

A niobium-containing coated electrode, designated Inco Weld "A"

~ electrode, was investigated for use in joining dissimilar metels. The

studies showed that where the metallicearc welding process could be
used, such veld deposits would be satisfactory for Joining dissimilar
metals for high-temperature service,

Molybdenum-to- Inconel joints were brazed with several materials
in connection with the fabrication of & pump-ghaft extension. All Joints
shoved a tendency to crack because of stresses built up by the different
thermal expansion properties of the base materials.

2.2. CHEMISTRY AND RADIATION DAMAGE

Phase studies are being conducted to determine whether the NaF-
BeF,-UF) system has any advantages over the LiF-BeF,-ThF, -UF) system.

coefficients ¢ ‘of chromium in chromium-nickel alloys with Cr
radiotracer. The results of recent experinents ‘have shown that the

“ iX =

systems will restrict the ThF) concentration to the range 10 to 15 mole %.
The substitution of UF), for part of the ThF), would be expected to lower
the liquidus temperature.

Plutonium trifluoride has been found to be sufficiently soluble in
LiF-BeF, and NaF-BeF, melts to form a fuel mixture for a high-temperature
plutonium-burning reactor. An apparatus was developed in which l-g
samples can ‘be used for phase-relationship studies.

The system KF-LiF-BeF, is being investigated as a , possible reactor
coolant. Such mixtures would have lower gamma activity than similar
NeF-base mixtures after irradiation. The mixture LiC1-EbCl ie also |
being examined as a possible coolant. Experimental studies of the com-
patibility of the chloride mixture with fuel mixtures have shown that
no uranium compound would deposit as the primary phase et reactor temper-
atures.

~ In studies of fission-product behavior, it was found that additions
of UF) had no effect on the solubility of CeF in LiF-BeF, (62-38
mole %). In another experiment it wes demonstrated that the addition
of CeF 4 to remove Su 5 from LiF-BeF,-UF) mixtures was effective even
when the SmF was present in trace amounts. The behavior of oxides in
molten fluorides is being studied as part of en effort to explore
chemical reactions which can be adapted to the reprocessing of molten-
fluoride-salt reactor fuels. -

‘In the study of the chemistry of the corrosion process, the

“metivity coefficients of the fluorides of ‘structural metals in dilute
solutions of ‘molten fluorides ‘have ‘been measured. The date. are useful

in understanding and predicting ‘the corrosion ‘reactions which take

place in systems in vaich molten fluorides are in contact vith alloys

Techniques have: ‘been: developed for determining the ‘self-diffusion

grain structure has e& marked influence on the self-diffusion rates of
chromium in Inconel. Grain size appears to be a controlling factor.
Hydrogen firing and ennealing in helium had the game ‘effects on the
over-all diffusion rate,

‘Salt samples taken from operating forcedscirculation corrosion-
testing loops with decreasing frequency vere analyzed. Samples taken
from an INOR-8 loop during the first 1000 br shoved a slow but steady
increase of chromium from about 420 to 530 ppm. Samples from en Inconel
loop showed an increase in chromium content from ebout 350 to 450 in
500 br. The chromium content of neither salt has reached a steady-
state value.

Vapor pressures af CsF-BeF,, are being measured to obtain values
on which to base estimates of the vapor pressures of LiF-BeF, mixtures.
© Activities in the LiF-BeF, system cannot be obtained from vapor-pressure
measurements because of complex essociation in the vapor phase. The
vepor pressure of liquid UF, vas measured between 4 and 180 mm Hg
(1030 to 1300°).

Further studies have been made of gaseous aluminum chloride as
a heat transfer medium. Calculations indicate that very low pumping
power would be required and that it would be useful as a turbine
working fluid. Experimental investigations of the compatibility of
aluminum chloride and structural metals have shown very little attack.

Reactor-grade graphite impregnated with LiF-MgF,, has been tested
in LiF-BeF,-UF) at 1250°F for 800 hr and examined for uranium pene
tration. Complete penetration of beryllium and uranium was found in
decreasing amounts with distance from the surface.

A series of tests was run to determine the effect of thermal cycling

on salt stability. It was found to be important in the bandling of
beryllium-~based fuels to ensure complete melting of a batch before any
portion is transferred to another container or test rig. Thermal
cycling under static conditions must be avoided.

The in-pile thermal convection loop that was being readied for
insertion into the LITR was found to have a deposit at the bottom of
the lower bend. Examination of the fuel from which it was filled
revealed the presence of uo, on solid pieces. A second loop is being
assembled.

- Methods have been developed for synthesizing simple fluorides by
reactions with stannous fluoride. The following fluorides have been
prepared: CrF,, MnF,, ALF, FeF,, VF, and UF), -

2.3. FUEL PROCESSING

The solubilities of fluorides of neptunium, corrosion products,
uranium, and thorium were investigated to evaluate their behavior in
the proposed HF dissolution process for recovering LiF-BeF, salt. On
the basis of this work, the recovered LiF-BeF, salt after processing
by the HF dissolution method would contain, at most, 0.001 mole %
neptunium. The solubility data indicate that the fluorides of neptunium
and possibly plutonium behave similarly to the rare earth fluorides.
Separation of the recovered LiF-BeF,, from corrogion~product fluorides
would probably be less effective, However, the solubility of any
particular contaminant fluoride is usually less in the presence of

others.

1.1. CONCEPTUAL DESIGN STUDIES AND
NUCLEAR CALCULATIONS

DESIGN OF A 30-Mw, ONE-REGION, EXPERIMENTAL, MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR

Conceptual designs of an experimental molten-salt reactor and power
plant arrangement have been prepared. In these designs, consideration
has been given to fabricability and to the elimination of awkward design
situations. An attempt has been made to take into account all features
of a finished power plant. Improvements in plant layouts and equipment
design will, of course, result from further study.

Reactor System. The proposed reactor consists of a 6-ft-dia
spherical core, a heat exchanger above . the core, and a sump-type fuel
pump offset from the main vertical axis and located slightly above the
heat exchanger, as shown in Fig. l.l.l. Liquid fuel leaving the pump
discharge is directed to the top of the heat exchanger, where it passes
downward. Flow through the heat exchanger is parallel and countercurrent,
with the fuel outside helical tubes containing an inert molten-salt heat
trensfer fluid. The fuel leaves the heat exchanger through a pipe that
communicates with the top of the spherical core; passes downward through
the center of the sphere, and reverses its direction of flow at the
bottom. It leaves: the core through an annulus at the top. This annulus
feeds the fuel directly to the gump “bowl of the ‘Fuel pump.

A small portion (about 10%) of “the total fuel flow is bypassed
through. a gas-stripping system. Directly above ‘the heat exchanger, at the
end of the _pump-discharge ‘diffuser, ‘there isa plate perforated with small

nozzles which spray the bypassed fuel above the plate and cause it to be
intermixed with helium flowing to an off-gas system. This helium

originates as a purge gas in the seal region of ‘the fuel pump. The
reactor fuel system may be filled with or drained of fuel through a dip
line that communicates with two valves in series and a storage tank

(not shown). A fuel enriching and sampling system, which is described in
a following section, is appended to the pump bowl.

There is an insulated gas passage surrounding the core vessel
which constitutes one leg of a heating or cooling loop. This gas loop
is provided to maintain the fuel above its melting point and below a fixed
maximum temperature during all off-design conditions. The remainder of
the gas loop consists of a blower, a heater, a cooler, and two dampers,
which operate to direct the flow through either the heater or the cooler.
The heater ig described in a following section.

The reactor system is surrounded by a double-walled steel cell. The
space between the two walls is monitored for leaks, Space coolers within
the cell keep the cell walls below 150°F.
| The design of the reactor system provides for semiremote maintenance.
Those components which have the highest probability of requiring
maintenance or replacement are located so that replacement involves a
minimm of remote operations.

Power Plent Arrangement. Preliminary layouts of the power plant are
presented in Figs. 1.1.2 and 1.1.3. It may be noted that the reactor 1s
at a higher elevation than the main condénser in the steam plant. This
arrangement avolds any posgibility of flood water entering the reactor
cell. Obviously this design feature will raise the building cost, and
it may be more economical to lower the reactor in relation to the condenser
and at the same time raise “the ‘whole plant to above the levels of the

: cooling-water source. - ‘In this case the price to be paid would be extra

pumping ‘costs. A detailed study of a particular site would be required

: Sd establich the proper relations.

In contrast to most steam pover Pleat. designs, the mein crane in

fe : the turbine-generator: room ‘also provides services to many of the other
- : major ‘components. of the plant, such as the evaporators, feedwater heaters,

‘and deserator. A schematic flow diagren of the power plant is presented

Fuel Sampling and Enriching Mechanism. The fuel sempling and
enriching mechanism, shown schematically in Figs. 1.1.5 end 1.1.6,
consists of a sampling-pot elevator; a horizontal conveyor; a sample-
depositing elevator; an enriching-capsule elevator; four, identical,
motorized worm-gear drives; several enriching-capsule magazines; several
shielded sample carriers; an enricher-magezine press; a sample-carrier
press; a solenold-operated stop; a canned remotely controlled gate valve;
a number of canned remotely controlled ball valves; a supply of sampling
capsules; and a supply of enriching capsules. All parts of the system
are enclosed in vacuum-tight piping that is insulated and shielded where
required. Every operation is remotely controlled and electrically
interlocked so that accidental improper sequences of operation cannot
damage the equipment.

The sampling-pot elevator carries ‘capsules from the ‘horizontal
conveyor down into the sampling pot of the reactor, either to obtain
samples or to add enriching capsules. It is actuated by a motor-driven
bronze worm-gear. Between the horizontal conveyor and the reactor are
a ball valve and gate valve. On the down stroke of the elevator plunger,
these must be opened in turn as the plunger approaches them, On the up
stroke, they must be closed immediately behind it.

The capsules are propelled along the horizontal conveyor by a transfer
plate suspended from a track. There are ‘breaks in the track where the
three elevators cross it. These breaks are filled by the plungers of the
elevators when they are in the up position. The transfer plate has a
hole in it through which the elevator Plungers operate to obtain or deposit
capsules. ‘There is a solenoid-operated stop provided to center the
transfer plate hole over the semple-dépositing ‘elevator. End-of «travel

stops center the hole over the other two elevators.’ A bolteon blind

flange 1s provided for access at the redctor end of the conveyor, and a

‘bolt-on flange matching that of the drive unit is welded to the other end.

At the bottom of the sample-depositing elevator plunger is a pair
of remotely controlled tongs that grip and release capsules as desired.
In their up position, the tongs bridge the gap in the horizontal
conveyor track. The tongs cannot open until the capsule is within the
shielded sample carrier. At the bottom of the elevator, the shielded
sample carrier rests upon a hydraulic press which forces it against &
seal in the elevator pipe flange to eliminate the necessity of bolting
it. The enriching capsule elevator is similar to the sample-depositing
elevator. |

System Preheating Device. Two designs of the heater bank for
heating the gas used to preheat the reactor system are being considered.
Tubular heaters with an Inconel sheath are included in one design end
flat ceramic heaters with an Inconel enclosure are utilized in the other
design. The main features of the units being studied are listed in
Table 1.1.1. The chief advantages of the flat ceramic heaters are: (1) the
wattage per unit surface area is less, (2) any number of heater dimensions
can be obtained, (3) the support for the ceramic plate is provided by
the enclosure, (4) fins can be added to the enclosure to provide
additional heat transfer surface if required, and the (5) vertical air
flow may simplify duct work. }

A diagram of a heater unit with two, flat, ceramic heaters is shown
in Fig. 1.1.7. A group of these units would provide a heater bank
with a capacity of 6 to 50 kw in a 2-ft by 2-ft duct.

Off-Gas System Valves. Frozen-bismuth valves are being considered
for use in the off-gas system, because (1) conventional metal-to-metal
seated valves are not consistently tight in the containment of fission-
product gases, (2) valves employing elastomer closures are of limited
life because radiation destroys the elastomer, and (3) devices such ag
bellows to replace stem glands tie the life of the valve to that
of the fatigue limit of the bellows. The use of frozen bismuth in a
trap to create a perfectly tight valve both processwise and environment-

wise has been demonstrated.’ Valves of this type have been considered
in the past only for limited operation (once open and once closed), but
two schemes for repeat action valves, shown in Figs. 1.1.8 and 1.1.9,
are now being studied.

The valve shown in Fig. 1.1.8 is gravity and temperature operated.
In the valve open position the bismuth in the lower trap is in the frozen
state. Likewise, in the valve closed position, all the bismuth shown is
in the frozen state. Heating zones 2 and 3 are operated together only
when the valve 1s to be opened; the bismuth is melted for a sufficient
time to allow complete drainage of the trident-shaped upper trap.
Heating zones 1A or 1B are operated in conjunction with heating zone 2
when it is desired to close the valve. In this operation bismuth flows
from one of the charge containers to the trident section end is
subsequently frozen in place. There is enough heet capacity in the
lower trap to prevent melting during the closure operation.

New charges of bismuth may be placed in either charge container
whenever the valve is in the closed position. If the valve is to have
a limited application, enough charge containers are built in place to
cover the number of operations expected, and no attempt is made to add
charges after the original installation.

A gas~pressure and temperature-operated valve is shown in Fig. 1.1.9.
Although it is simpler in construction than the gravity-operated device,
it may be ‘argued that it is not foolproof . Strict control of the maximum
operating gas pressure while the sealant is in ‘the molten state would be
highly necegsary in this device. -

PRELIMINARY DESIGN OF A 315-Mw (e) GRAPHITE-MODERATED MOLTEN-SALT POWER
REACTOR To -

A preliminary study>’ 3 was made of a one-region molten-salt power
reactor in which the fuel is in contact with the unclad graphite moderator.
The molten-salt fuel flows through holes in the -graphite, which is
contained in a cylindrical INOR-8 vessel. .The graphite core is 12.25 ft
in diemeter and 12.25 £t high, with 3.6-in.-dis holes on 8-in. centers.

The fuel, LiF-BeF,-UF, (70-10-20 mole %), contains low-enrichment (1.30%)
uranium, and it occupies 16% of the core volume. A diagram of the:reactor
gystem is shown in Fig. 1.1.10.

The choice of the power level for this design study was arbitrary,
since the core is capable of operation at 1500 Mw (th) without: exceeding
safe pover densities. An electrical generator of 333-Mw (e) capacity
was chosen, which would give a station output of 315 Mw (e). The reactor
power rating would thus bBe:760.Mw (th).

A plan view of the reactor plant layout is presented in Fig. 1l.l.ll,
end an elevation view is shown in Fig. 1.1.12. The reactor and the ~
primary heat exchangers are contained in a large rectangular reactor cell,
which is sealed to provide double contaimment for any léaskage of fission
gases. The rectangular configuration of the plant permits the grouping
of similar equipment with a minimum of floor space and piping. The
plant includes, in addition to the reactor and heat exchanger systems

The off-gas system provides for the continuous removel of fissione
product gases and serves several purposes. The safety of the system in
the event of a fuel spill is considerably enhanced if the radioactive
ges concentration in the fuel is reduced by stripping the gas as it is
formed. Further, the nuclear stability of the reactor under changes of
power level is improved by keeping the high-cross-section Xe 3’
continuously at a low level. Finally, many of the fission-product poisons
are, in their decay chains, either noble gases for a period of time or
end their decay chains as stable noble gases, and therefore the buildup
of poisons is considerably reduced by eas removal.

Details of the nuclear. ‘calculations pertinent $0 this design study

are presented ina subsequent section of this chapter.
woreaR cancun

> Reactivity I Befeots ih Experimental | Molten-Salt Reactor. . Various

reactivity effects in’ ‘the experimental reactor described above were
“calculated. The first calculation was an estimate of ‘the reactivity
‘effect of: ‘draining the first layer of diphenyl coolant from the thermal

shield. This draining resulted in a loss in reactivity, §k/k, of 1.89%.
Another reactivity calculation was performed to estimate the effect of
inserting 100 g of ue3 in the form of UF), at the center of the reactor.
This resulted in a gain in reactivity, §k/k, of 0.39%. The Cornpone
program was used for these reactivity calculations.

A temperature coefficient was also calculated for the experimental
reactor by using the procedure described in the MolteneSalt Reactor
Program Status Report. The over-all temperature coefficient of reactivity
was estimated to be =6.75 x 10 => ( Sx/x)/°F.

Neutron and Gamma-Ray Activity in the Secondary Heat Exchanger of the
Interim Design Reactor. The present specifications for the Interim
Design Reactor call for the use of sodium es the heat transfer fluid in
the first intermediate heat exchange loop that links the reactor to the
steam system, There are several disadvantages in the use of sodium,
among which are its flammability, incompatibility with the fuel salt
(uranium is reduced and may precipitate), end a 15«hr half-life, high=
level, beta-and-gamma activity that is induced by exposure of the sodium
to delayed neutrons in the primary heat exchanger.

The use of the nonsuranium-bearing salt mixture LiF-BeF, (63-37
mole %) in the first intermediate logp as an alternative to the sodium
has accordingly ‘been studied. This salt is an excellent heat transfer
medium; it is compatible with the fuel; and it is nonflammble. The
nature and amount of the induced radioactivity conld therefore be the
decisive factor in the choice between the salt and the sodium.

A Cornpone calculation wes made in which the neutron capture and
leakage parameters for the primary heat exchanger treated as a subcritical
reactor were estimated, This calculation was followed by a Sorghum

 

Myolten-galt Reactor Program Status Report, P 179, ORNL=2634

(Nov. 12, 1958).

calculation in which the spectra of the four maim groups of delayed
neutrons were used separately to estimate the distribution of the captures
of these neutrons in fuel, metal, and coolant. With these data, an MIT
Practice School group estimated the neutron and gamma-ray activity to be
expected in the secondary heat exchanger.” Their results are summarized
in Table 1.1.2. It may be seen that the gamma-ray dose from the molten-
salt coolant is only one-half that expected from the sodium. Further,
the decay rate in the salt is orders of magnitude greater. It was
estimated that following cessation of circulation of the coolant it would
require about two weeks for the activity of the sodium system to reach

g level of 7.5 mr /hr, whereas the salt system would reach this level in

5 to 10 min. :

The possibility that neutrons might be generated in the secondary
heat exchanger by y-n reactions was investigated by the MIT group. The
sodium would not produce any neutrons, but the possibility that the 1.63-
Mev gamma, ray from Feo might lle sufficiently close to the ‘threshold of
the 7=-n reaction in Be’ to produce a significant neutron activity was
studied carefully. It was concluded that, on the basis of presently
gvailable data, no apprecieble neutron activity need be expected.

Effect of Ion-Exchange Processing of Rare-Earth Fission Products on
Performance of Interim Design Reactor. The present specifications of the
interim design reactor call for processing of the fuel salt (600 £13) at
the rate of 1.6 £t3/aay (600 £63 /yr) by the fluoride-volatility process
which would recover all isotopes of uranium from the salt. The base

It has been proposed, alternatively, {0 remove the rare-earth

resonance parameters, and the poisoning from 0.15 mole % Cel 4 was
determined by means of a Cornpone calculation. The poisoning was
found to be negligible.

The long-term nuclear performance of the interim design reactor
with CeF4 processing was then studied by means of a Sorghum calculation.
A processing rate of 18 £43 /day (600 £43 /month) was selected, and it
was assumed that the fuel stream returning to the reactor system
contained negligible concentrations of high-cross-séction fission
products. The results of the calculation sre shown in Fig. 1.1.13,
where regeneration ratio, critical inventory, and cumulative net burnup
are plotted vs time of operation. in years, and are compared with the
corresponding performance of the same system utilizing the fluoride-
volatility processing method.

It may be seen that the ion-exchange processing method gives
substantial improvements in performance. The average critical inventory
is about 50% less, and the cumulative net burnup is about 30% less.

The calculation did not take into account the poisoning from samarium
isotopes and non-rare-earth fission products thet would not be
removed by this process.

Multigroup Oracle Programs for Heterogeneous Reactor Computations.
The 3l-group Oracle program Cornpone was modified to permit evaluations
of heterogeneous reactors on a routine basis. A new boundary option
providing for a zero net current of neutrons vas added, which permits
the calculation of an infinitely long unit cell in en infinite lattice
in cylindrical geometry. A subprogram was added to compute, for each
neutron group, the ratio of the ‘average £lux in the fuel region to
the ‘average flux in the cell, and the ratio of the average flux in the
moderator to the average flux in the cell. These ratios were designated
"group disadvantage factors” for fuel and moderator regions, respectively.

The disadvantage factors were then applied in a calculation of
"finite, homogeneized” reactors. Fuel and moderator materials were

mixed in proportions corresponding to those used in the unit cell,

The diameter of the equivelent spherical core and the thicknesses of
core vessel, blanket, reflector, etc., were specified, as usual. A
subprogram was added by means of which the cross sections of the fuel
and moderator materials were then multiplied groupwise by the appropriate
disadvantage factors. From that point the calculation proceeds in

the usual manner.

The modified program was tested by computing the multiplication
constant for the ORNL Graphite Reactor. ‘Cross sections for 238 metal
were estimated by taking into account resonance saturation and Doppler
broadening. Neutron energies ranged down to 0.079 ev, the thermal energy
(1180°F) in the molten-salt reactors: Cross sections for aluminum were i
also added. With the use of specifications given by Ramsey and Cagle, | )
k was estimated to be 0.967 for the reactor at 1180°F. This value appears
to be reasonably correct. Further calculations to permit estimation
of the multiplication at the operating “temperature (350° F) are planned. .
Cross sections for 238 ine mixture containing 70 mole $ LiF, 10 mole %
BeF oy and 20 mole % UF), were computed and added to the cross-section
Livery.

With the use of the new code and the i calculated cross
sections for various ThF) melts, geveral uranium and thorium cycle
reactors were computed, as described in subsequent sections of this
chapter. | |

In order to ‘study the long-term ‘behavior of heterogeneous reactors,

the Oracle program Sorghum was modified. Provisien for absorption of
: neutrons by graphite wag made, ’ and group disadvantage factors derived

from the modified Cornpone program ‘were applied separately to fuel and
graphite. The fission product Sm 149 was treated separately from the

~other fission products. For evaluating plutonium converters, the

existing program was modified to compute ingrowth of put0, pu and

pu? in place of Pas33, ?33 and o3h,
The modified program works well with bare and blanketed reactors,
but the critical calculation was found to be unstable in the case of

graphite-reflected reactors. In the reactor model embodied in Sorghum,

the net leakage in each group is assumed to be proportional to the
space~averaged flux in the corresponding group. This is & reasonably
good approximation in bare and blanketed reactors in which the slowing
down in the second region is small, and the net leakage in any given
group is nearly independent of the leakage in groups of higher energy.
In graphite-reflected reactors, however, this approximation is not
good. Two cases of graphite-moderated reactors have been studied for
periods of up to ten years by means of the modified program described
in subsequent sections of this chapter.

Oracle Program GHIMSR for Gamma -Heating Calculations. A code was
written to expedite gamma-heating calculations, in which an integral-
spectrum method is used to calculate the heating in a spherical reactor
system. Gamma-energy absorption coefficients for 12 groups are stored
and used to obtain average absorption coefficients for the reactor and
core vessel.

The necessary inputs: for the calculations include the radius of
the reactor, the core and core vessel compositions, and gamma source
distributions in space and energy. The time of computation for one
source is approximately 3 min. The program was checked against hand
computations and was found to be performing satisfactorily.

to estimate the initial nuclear performance of the graphite-moderated,

are arranged in a square array measuring 8 in. between centers. The
fuel solution is LiF-BeF,-UF) (70-10-20 mole %), and the calculation
indicated that a fuel enrichment of 1.3 mole % is required to make
the system critical.

The slowing-down, leakage, and disadvantage parameters obtained
from the Cornpone calculation were used in a Sorghum calculation to
study the long-term nuclear performance of the system without fuel
processing. An extract from the results is given in Table l.l.3,
and key parameters sre graphed in Fig. l.l.lk. |

The accumulation of fission products progressively poisons the
reactor. The regeneration ratio, initially 0.79, falls steadily to
0.5 after 7200 megawatt years (Mwy) of cumulative power generation.
The critical inventory falls, at first, because of the ingrowth of
plutonium isotopes, but it then rises steadily from an initial value

. of about 1000 kg to about 4500 kg. The cumulative net burnup amounts

to about 1500 kg in T200 Mwy; the enrichment of the fuel added varies,
but averages 60% during the first five years.

The cost figures given in ref 2 were calculated on the basis of
& one~-group nuclear caleulation in ‘which progressive. hardening of

of the system was studied by means of the Oracle program Sorghum.
An extract from the calculations is given in Table 1l.1l.h.

For a cumulative power generation of T200 Mwy, the critical
inventory rose to 1416 kg, and the cumulative net burnup amounted to
1083 kg. This performance is substantially better than that exhibited
by the corresponding low-enrichment system, which required an inventory
of 4386 kg and had a cumulative net burnup of 1400 kg. The disparity
between the two systems is expected to increase with time.

Initisl Nuclear Performance of One-Region, GraphiteeModerated,
Graphite-Reflected, The32 Conversion, Molten-Salt Reactor. The initial
nuclear characteristics of a heterogeneous, graphite-moderated
and -reflected, one-region, molten-salt reactor were studied. The
reactor considered in the calculations consists of a cylindrical core,
15 ft in diameter and 15 ft high, surrounded by a 2.5«ftethick graphite
reflector contained in a l-in.-thick INOR-8 pressure shell. The core
is penetrated by cylindrical fuel passages arranged on an 8-in.
triangular lattice parallel to the core axis. The resulting unit cells
are hexagonal and 15 ft long. This system has not been optimized,

- and & much better design might conceivably be evolved. The initial
nuclear characteristics of the system are compared in Tables l.l.5 and
1.1.6 with the characteristics of the interim design reactor.

The modified Oracle program Cornpone was used to ‘calculate k and
group disadvantage factors for the fuel and graphite. These results
vere then used for complete reactor calculations in spherical geometry
of a core having the same volume as the actual cylindrical core. Mean
"homogeneized" densities (atoms/cm) were used for each element.

It may be seen that the regeneration ratio of the heterogeneous
reactor is more favorable than that of the interim design reactor. The

initial critical inventory of 0°39, on the other hand, is 60% higher than

in the interim design reactor. It is estimated that a power level of
760 Mw (th) can be attained in the heterogeneous system compared with
600 Mw (th) in the homogeneous reactor.

1.2. COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING
'SALT-LUBRICATED BEARINGS FOR FUEL PUMPS

Hydrodynamic Journal Bearings. The fourth test of a salt-lubricated
hydrodynamic bearing was completed and terminated on schedule after 1000
‘br of operation. The test was performed with salt No. 130. (LLF-BeFy-UF,,
62-37=1 mole %) under steady-state conditions: temperature, 1200 °F;
journal speed, 1200 rpm; bearing radial. load, 200 lb. Postrun examination
revealed that slight. rubbing hed occurred between the bearing and journal.
Since this test bearing was started and stopped only a very few times
as compared with the bearing which was tested previously and started and
stopped 87 tines (rather than 94 times, as reported erroneously in the
previous report’ L during a total operating time of 784 hr, it appears
that the rubbing marks may not be attributed entirely to starting and
stopping operations. Wear on the journal bearing used in the fourth test
appears to be slightly less than on the journal bearing which was
subjected to 87 starts and stops.

A fifth test of 360 hr duration, for which new bearing and journal
parts fabricated of INOR-8 were used, was also completed. Salt No. 130
was used as the lubricant and the system was maintained at 1200°F. The
| Journal speed and bearing radial load were varied over wide ranges (600
to 2700 rpm and 0 to 500 1b, respectively). Thirty combinations of speed
and load were applied for periods of 2 hr each. There were no difficulties
observed during these tests. Postrun examination of the bearing revealed |
that slight rubbing ovourred. between the bearing end journal.

A sixth test with the bearing and journal used in the fifth test
is under way to investigate bearing performance at steady-state conditions
of journal speed and bearing radial load (1200 rpm and 200 1b) and at
temperatures varying in 50°F intervals from 1200 to 1500°F Bearing
performance is being observed for 4 hr at each temperature level.

All these tests have been performed with a radial clearance of 0.005
in. between the bearing and journal surfaces, as measured at room tempera
ture. The continuing analytical studies and surveys of recent literature
indicate that it may be possible to improve the performance of this
bearing by increasing the clearance to, 0.007 in.

Hydrodynamic Thrust Bearings. Construction of a thrust-bearing
tester is approximately 80% complete. The tester shown schematically
in Fig. 1.2.1, utilizes & PK type of centrifugal pump (without impeller)
that was modified In the impeller region to permit installation of the
test thrust bearing. The tester includes provisions for varying bearing
load, journal speed, and test temperature. The thrust runner is mounted
on the lower end of the pump shaft and the stationary member of the thrust
bearing is supported by a load actuator. The load actuator consists of
two concentric bellows with common end flanges. Pressure applied
internally to the bellows assembly results in an axial force (design
maximum, 500 1b at 1200°F) applied to the thrust bearing. The first
bearing to be investigated will be of the step type. |

Test Pump Equipped. with a Salt-Lubricated Journal Bearing. A PK
type of centrifugal ‘pump is being modified to include a ‘molten-salt-

lubricated Journal bearing near the impeller, an upper bearing (both

radial and thrust) lubricated either with oil or grease, and an overhung

drive motor. The molten-salt-lubricated bearing will be tested through

the full scope of : ‘loadings and clearance problens existing in a pump
operating at high temperatures.

Hydrostatic Bearings. The previously describeds water tests of
hydrostatic bearings were completed and a report describing the tests
and giving the results is being prepared. The final test, for which
the bearing radial clearance was 0.005 in., was made at various speeds
with various system flow resistances. Postrun examination revealed that
slight rubbing occurred between the bearing and Journal. Further work
with this type of bearing (and also with rotating-pocket hydrostatic
bearings) has been deferred because of the favorable results being
obtained with the less complicated hydrodynamic type of journal bearings
end the increased emphasis on thruste~bearing testing.

Bearing Mountings. Investigations of bearing mounts to accommodate
dimensional changes resulting from differences in coefficients of
expansion of the bearing and mounting materials have been de-emphasized
because of the favorable results being obtained with the use of INOR-8
for Journal, sleeve, and mount. Promising techniques have not yet been
found. : The "Thermoflex" journal bearing mounts designed by Westinghouse
Electric Manufacturing Company are not yet available in the sizes of

interest.

MECEANICAL SEALS FOR FUEL PUMPS

Labyrinth and Split-Purge Arrengement. The previously described
results of tests of a PK type of pump with a labyrinth seal and split-
purge gas arrangement were correlated and a test report was issued.

Bellows-Mounted Seal, The modified Fulton-Sylphon bellows-mounted
seal! being subjected to an endurance test in a PK-P type of centrifugal
pump has accumulated an additional 2520 hr of operation since the previous
report period, for e total of 10,630 hr. The pump has been operating
at a temperature of. 1200°F, a shaft speed of 2500 rpm, and a ReK flow rate
of 1200 gpm. The test-seal leakage continued to be negligible throughout
the period. Three pump stoppages occurred; one that was caused by a
power feilure and two that were for replacing brushes in the drive motor.

PUMP ENDURANCE TESTING

An MF type of centrifugal pump has been circulating fuel 30 (NaF -
ZrF) UF, 50-46-k mole %) in continuous operation for 13,500 hr since
June 26, 1957; without maintenance, For the past 11,500 hr the pump has
been operated under cavitation damage conditions. The fuel 30 flow rate
is 645 gpm; the shaft speed is 2700 rpm; the pump tank cover gas ig at
& pressure of 2. 5 psig; and the temperature of the circulating salt mixture
is 1200°F, 4 recently published® . operational resume presents’ an account

The small frozen-lead pump seal being tested on a 3/16-in.-dia shaft,
as described previously,” has operated continuously since it started
operation on June 13, 1958. As of January 1, 1959 the accumulated
operating time was L4B4O hr. Following slight leakage of lead during the
first 100 hr of operation, there has been no further leakage.

A large frozen-lead geal on a 3 1/h=in.-dia rotating shaft has been

placed in operation. The frozen-lead seal retains molten lead at a

temperature of approximately 1000°F in a tank. The test equipment is
shown in Figs. 1.2.2 and 1.2.3. The three separate cooling coils used to
maintain the lead below its melting point in the bottom of the sealing
gland are shown in Fig. 1.2.4. Thermocouples, located between the cooling
coils, may also be seen in Fig. 1.2.k.

The shaft is mounted in two self~aligning, pillow-block bearings
attached to the support frame. A 10-hp Louis Allis motor and magnetic
clutch are connected to the bottom end of the shaft through an adjustable
coupling.

As may be seen in Fig. 1.2.2, the sealing gland incorporates a long,
tapered amulus ’ Vhich' DaTTOVS to. provide a clearance between the shaft
and the sealing gland of 8 few thousandths of an inch. The upper end of

in each of the three cooling coils can be controlled separately. The
supply pressures of water end air are maintained at constant levels.

In preparation for filling with lead, the equipment was heated to
operating temperature. With the shaft rotating at 100 rpm, the tank was
filled with 120 1b of lead at 1000°F At the present time, the shaft
is being run at 1300 rpm. The corresponding peripheral speed of the shaft’
1s 1100 frm, which is about 10 times the peripheral speed of the 3/16-in.-
die shaft operating in the small frozen~lead seal test. Water at a flow
rate of approximately 2 gpm is being used as the coolant for the geal
gland, Small amounts of lead have leaked sporadically from the sealing
gland. oo |

There was no indication of salt leakage during the test, but gas
leakage tests after the high-temperature salt test yielded leakage rates
in excess of the maximum allowable leakage rate of 10 7 ems of helium
per second. After the clamp bolts on both flanges were tightened to
again provide & bolt loading of 200 fi-1lb per bolt, the flanges were
leak tested a fourth time. The leakage rates were 9.4 x 108cm3 of heltm
per second or less and were thus again below the specified maximum
allowable rate.

Both Joints were easily disassembled in about 15 min. The frozen
salt in each Joint wes caked to the stainless steel insert screen, as
shown in Fig. 1.2.6, One flange is shown with the screen and salt seal
removed in Fig. 1.2.7. The flange faces were sufficiently clean for
reassembly of the Joint. |

the same aluminum sealing rings. The leskage rate for Joint No.l was
in excess of 10 | =7 ems of helium per second. The leakage rate for Joint
No. 2 was 6 x 10 -8 em of helium per second.

TRIPLEX-TUBING HEAT EXCHANGER DEVELOPMENT

A seven-tube test heat exchanger was designed (Fig. 1.2.8) with
which to evaluate the triplex heat exchanger tubing being developed
by the Metallurgy Division for molten-salt or liquid metal-to-steam
superheater applications. The triplex tubing consists of inner and
outer tubes with sintered metal powder or wire mesh in the annulus between
them. This tubing was designed to provide positive separation of fluids -
with minimum thermal resistance between the inner and outer tubes and to
provide a means of leak detection in that the pressure of a gas occupying
the voids in the sintered metal in the annulus could be monitored.
Details of the tube development program are included in Cheap, 2.1 of
this report. |

The design of a small heat exchanger test stand has been revised
to accommodate this heat exchanger for heat transfer and reliability

DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, AND OPERATION OF MATERIALS TESTING LOOPS

Forced=Circulation Loops. The operation of forced-circulation
corrogsion~testing loops was continued. Three new loops were started and
one loop was terminated, on schedule, during the quarter. By the end
of October, the 15 forcede-circulation loop test stands were operating
at full capacity. Eleven of the facilities occupying five column bays
of Bldg. 9201-3 may be seen in Fig. 1.2.11. The remaining four loops
are located to the right and across the aisle from the area shown.

Two of the three new loops started during the quarter were constructed
of INOR-8 and the other was constructed of Inconel. One INOR~8 loop and
one Inconel loop (designated MSRP-12 and 9377-5, respectively, in the
operations summary, Table 1.2, 3) were equipped with a molten-salt
sampling device, 17 vhich makes possible the removal of samples during
operation. The results of analyses of the 57 samples that have been
removed from these two loops are presented in Chap. 2.2 of this report.

The loop terminated was the Inconel loop listed as 934k-l in
Table 1.2.3, which had operated a full year with a temperature difference
soTO8E the loop. The facility from which this loop was removed was
modified according to the new design’ for improved operation before
loop 9377-5 was installed. Of the 15 facilities in operation at the .
present Vine, nine are of the new design and the remaining six are in
various stages of improvement.

provided with the necessary equipment assumed isothermal operation
automatically, and steps were taken to prevent freeze~ups of the
remaining semiprotected loops. All loops were returned to test
conditions with no adverse effects and with a minimum of lost time.

The preventive maintenance program on the corrosion-testing
facilities requires that the loops be operated isothermally when it is
necessary to repair or replace worn or defective equipment. Such events
are listed in Table 1.2.3 under comments only if it was necessary to
drain the operating fluid into the system sump.or to change the operating
fluid when a system was opened.

In-Pile Loops. Operation of the first in-pile loop was started in
the MIR December 3, 1958. The loop operated satisfactorily at design
conditions until January 8, 1959 (nearly two MTR cycles) when a high
radiation field accompanied by fission-gas release developed in the
vicinity of the cubicle containing the loop. Loop operation vas
terminated. The radiation release has been traced to a partially
plugged pump=-sump purge-outlet line which caused fission gmses to back=~
diffuse up the pump~sump purge-inlet line to a point outside the cubicle,
where they escaped through e leak. The loop had’ accumulated a total of
860 hr of operation, of which approximately 700 hr were with the reactor

The operation of the second prototype in-pile pump wes terminated
after 2500 hr of satisfactory operation at the design conditions of the
first loop. Examination showed the pump to be in the as-installed -
condition, except for an accumulation of salt in the intermediate region
between the pump sump and bearing-housing region. The accumulation had
been observed by x-ray examination during operation of the pump, but it
was considered to be of insufficient quantity to cause difficulty. |

~The third prototype in-pile pump, which is still being tested, has
accumulated over 2000 hr of satisfactory operation, This pump is identical
to that installed in the second inepile loop and incorporates means to

eliminate salt accumulation in the intermediate region. X-ray
examinations of the operating pump have verified the effectiveness of
the modification. : :

The assembly of the second inepile loop is approximately 60%
complete, This loop will incorporate modifications to the purge system
which should prevent a recurrence of the difficulty encountered with
the first loop.

PHYSICAL PROPERTY MEASUREMENTS

Viscosity. Viscometers of the gravity-flow capillary=-efflux type,
which have been employed almost routinely in determinations of the
viscosities of molten-salt mixtures, have recently given unexpectedly
irregular results® for beryllium-containing fluoride mixtures. Efforts
to increase the experimental precision of the date have led to modifications
both in the efflux-cup design and in the cup calibration technique.

The design of the modified efflux-cup viscometer is illustrated in
Fig. 1.3.1. It differs from previous designs in two significant respects:
(1) the length of the cup was increased to provide either 120 or 240%
more fluid volume, and (2) a serrated "skirt" was added to the lower
outside portion of the cup. The first of these changes allowed longer
flow times and diminished the effect of initial surface "humping," and the
second change assured that drainage along the outside surface did not
interfere with the discharge from the capillary tube.

The new cups were calibrated with a NaNO, -NalNO,.-KNO, (40=T7=53 wt %)
mixture of known viscosity.> In the temperature range 150 to 400° Cc,
this salt bas a kinematic viscosity that is in the same range as
the kinematic viscosities of ‘the fluoride salts at 500 to 800°C.

DYNAMIC CORROSION STUDIES

Thermal=Convection Loop Tests. Examinations of two Inconel thermal-
convection loops that operated with fused fluoride mixtures for one year
at 1350°F were completed during the quarter. One of the loops (1181) which’
circulated a blanket salt of the composition LiF-ThF) (71-29 mole %),
showed atteck in ‘the form of subsurface voids to a depth of 6.5 mils along
hot-leg sections. No attack or deposits were observed in cold-leg sections.
The other loop (1184) which circulated the fuel mixture NeF -ZrF), -UF,
(55.3-40.7-k mole %), was similarly attacked to a depth of 7 mils and
showed no attack or deposits in. cold-leg sections.

A third Inconel loop (1223) was examined after completing 1000 hr
of operation at 1350°F with the fuel mixture LiF-BeF,~UF; . Attack in
this loop occurred. as light intergranular void formation to a maximum
depth of 1 mil. The fuel mixture circulated in this loop was obtained
from the seme batch as a mixture circulated in loop 1222, described
previously.’ However, prior to operation in loop 1223, an analysis of the
fuel was made to detect sulfur contamination. In the course of this
analysis, the fuel, while molten, was purged extensively with HF and
hydrogen ens. No measurable sulfur contamination vas found, and, in ]
general, the impurity concentrations ‘appeared to be unaffected by this
treatment. However, the as-received fuel caused heavy attack to a depth
of 3 mils in loop 1202 under conditions otherwise identical to those of
loop 1223, An effect of the purging treatment on the corrosiveness of

the fuel is therefore evident, but the mechanism through which this effect
occurred has not been ldentified.

Operation of an Inconel thermal-convection loop with the salt
mixture NaF-LiF-KF (11.5-46.5-42 mole %) was terminated after 4673 hr in
order to provide additional test space for salts of currently greater
program interest. The maximum operating temperature of the loop vas
1250°F. Examination of this loop (1214) revealed extensive attack along
hot-leg sections to a depth of 13 mils, but the cold-leg sections showed
no evidence of mass transfer. Chemical analysis of the salt after the
test showed a significant increase in the chromium content compared with
that found by analysis prior to the test.

The occurrence of such gross attack in the absence of observable
mess transfer strongly indicated that the fuel became contaminated either
prior to or subsequent to introduction into the loop. The high chromium
concentration was unexpected because there was no UF), in the salt. A
subsequent check of the salt by petrographic and x-ray analyses revealed
the presence of approximately 15% KF+2H,0. The presence of this
constituent suggests that water, a highly oxidizing impurity in the
fluoride systems, was introduced into the salt at some point before or
during the test and was responsible for the extensive attack.

Forced=Circuletion Loop Tests. The status of the forced-circulation
loops now in operation with fluoride salts is presented in Chap. 1.2; no
tests were completed during the quarter.

carburize Inconel and INOR-8 by exposure for 4OOO hr at 1200°F. The

test procedures and spparatus were described previously. Room-
temperature mechanical tests show that the tensile strength and elongation
of the carburized INOR-8 decreased (~6.5% and 50%, respectively) in
comparison with the tensile strength and elongation of the control
specimens. The control specimens were subjected to an argon atmosphere
for the same time and at the same temperature thet the carburized

yield strengths of the earburized Inconel specimens increased (~24% and
9%, respectively), while the elongation decreased, in comparison with the

same properties of Inconel control specimens. Carburization was found

metallographically to a depth of about 7 mils on both metals. Chemical
analyses of the carburized specimens of both Inconel and INOR-8 showed
decreasing carbon content with depth as indicated in Table 2.1.1. The.
values obtained from the chemical analyses were used to prepare the

Uranium Precipitation From Fused Fluoride Salts in Contact with }

' Gra raphite, Tests were continued in the study of the compatibility of
graphite and molten-salt fuel mixtures. As described previously,’

the test systems are radiographed periodically to check for uo,
precipitation from the fuel mixture and penetration of the Fuel into the
graphite.

Uranium oxide precipitation has been found in all tests in which
the fuel mixture 130 has been used in contact with graphite et 1300 op
In these tests the ratio of the calculated projected surface area of the
graphite to the volume of the fuel was 9. 6:1. The fraction of the
uranium that ‘precipitates from fuel 130 appears to be finite and
complete within a Sehr exposure to graphite at 1300°F under a vacuum of
less than 0.1 ho The basis for the conclusion that the precipitation is
finite is that no detectable changes in the initial quantities of
precipitate have been seen radiographically in any of the test systems,
even after exposures as long as 3000 hr.

The quantity of uranium precipitated appears to be an indirect .
function of the purity of the graphite; that is, the greatest quantities
of precipitated uranium are found in the test systems containing the
most impure graphite. The impurities in the graphite are traces of
metals, and since the adsorptive qualities of graphite are increased and
degassing is made more difficult by metallic: contaminants, it 4s believed
that the oxygen source for the uranium precipitation vas adsorbed to a
greater extent on the less pure graphite. .

The ‘graphites used in the test systems in which uranium n precipttatio
has been found were degassed at 2350 °F for 5 hr under a vecuum of less
than bp s flooded with argon, and then exposed to air for 3 min while they

were being weighed, Apparently the brief exposure to air was sufficient
for the graphite to pick up enough contamination to cause the uranium
precipitation. In contrast to the results being obtained for fuel 130,
no segregation or precipitation has been found radiographically when fuel
30 (NaF -2rF) -UF), 50-46-4 mole %) is in contact with graphite at 1300 °F
under a vacuum of less than O. A for 3000 hr or longer.

In the tests under vay, steps are being taken to determine definitely
whether graphite is directly or indirectly responsible for uranium
precipitation from fuel 130 under these, conditions. Since, on the basis
of the preliminary results, . graphite does appear to be responsible ’
attempts are being made to. determine whether the precipitation can be
eliminated by using purer graphite and/or by purging the graphite with gas
or liquid prior to exposure to fuel 130.

Fused Floride Salt Penetration Into Graphite. Fuel 30 —
into graphite pore spaces has been erratic in tests of 1000 hr or less
at 1300°F under a vacuum of <0.l4 . The graphite specimens have
shown no penetration to heavy penetration.2’’ The penetration is probably
due to contamination of the graphite; reaction products are being sought
to verify this supposition. The effect of pressure on “the penetration of:
fuel 30 into graphite pore spaces at 1300°F is being investigated. The
pressure being used in a test now in progress is 150 psia.

In examinations Just started, weight-change measurements of TSF-grade
graphite ‘specimens that had. been exposed for 2000 and 4000 hr to fuel 130
at 1300° F under a vacuum of approximately 0.1K have indicated ‘that fuel
130 aid not penetrate the graphite during. the 2000~hr- exposure. A weight
gain resulting from the L4000=hr exposure ‘is being investigated to
determine whether. there was ‘penetration or whether reaction products were

formed. In two tests of 100-hr. duration at 1300 °F, fuel 30. under a pressure

of F150 psia has not ‘penetrated evacuated (<12 H) graphite. Be

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF ‘INOR-8

| Pebricability and corrosion resistance to fused salts are perhaps
the most importent requirements for a structural material for the
molten~salt reactor, but the high-temperature strength of the material
is also important from a design standpoint. The INOR-8 alloy presently
being considered as the structural material for the molten-salt reactor
system was developed principally to possess corrosion resistance; it
is presently being studied from the standpoint of its strength properties.
Tests are under vay in which tensile strength, creep, relaxation, and.
fatigue effects are being evaluated. This testing program has two

‘objectives: first, to obtain reliable data suitable for use in design
‘engineering, ‘and, _second, to explore many of the fectors » other than

stress end temperature, which may affect the strength properties. So

Tensile and creep data obtained in air were presented previousiy® 7
which indicated that the strength of INOR-8 approaches that'of the
strongest stainless steels. Tests to determine the creep strength of
INOR»8 in molten salts are under way. Times to 1% strain as a function
of temperature and stress in short-time tests were Presented previously, |
and long-time tests are in progress at 1100 and 1200 °F. Specimens
stressed at 25,000 psi at 1100°F have not yet reached 1% creep strain.
even after 6000 hr.

The results obtained by ORNL in molten salts were compared with
results obtained by the Haynes Stellite Company in air in the previous -
report, | but differences in the heat treatment of the specimens prevented

any conclusions from being drawn with respect to the relative effects

Tensile data available for INORe8 show that the ductility decreases
rapidly with increasing temperature between 1000 and 1500 °F. For example,
: elongations ranging from 15 to 30% have been found at 1400°F; whereas,

at 1000°F, ‘the ductility may be as high as 60%. Since low ductilities
‘are sométimes associated with notch sensitivity, several tensile tests
were conducted in order to establish. the notched~to-unnotched strength
ratio. A ratio greater than unity is considered to indicate notch
strengthening, while a ratio less than. unity signifies notch sensitivity.

psi at 100 rpm, fatigue lives for two specimens were found to be 730,000
and 930,000 cycles. A comparable life for Inconel tested under similar
conditions would be produced by a stress of approximately 18,000 psi.

 

MATERIALS FABRICATION STUDIES

Triplex Tubing for Heat Exchangers. The feasibility of fabricating
heat exchanger tubing that involves two concentric tubes with a porous
metal in the annulus between them through which a gas can be passed for
leak detection is being studied. Initially, two samples, each approximately

 
 

 

 

 

--86--

18 in. long, were prepared by temping and vibrating Inconel powder into
the 0.125-in. annulus between two Inconel tubes and sintering for 2 hr
at 2250°F in a hydrogen atmosphere. . A density of about 50% of theoretical
was achieved in the sintered material in the annuli of the tubes, and
x~ray examination showed the bonding to be unsatisfactory. One sample
was subsequently drawn from 1.000 in. OD to 0.875 in. OD and resintered.
This tube was found by x-ray and metallographic inspections to have
good bonding; e density of 75% was achieved in the sintered material
in the annulus. Evaluation tests of these tubes by the Reactor Projects
Division have shown the tube with 50% dense sintered material in the
annulus to have a low permeebility for helium and the permeability of
the 75% dense material to be a factor of 100 less.

In order to obtain good thermal conductivity across the annulus,
attempts bave been made to fabricate tubes with porous nickel rather
than Inconel in the annulus. Preliminary studies of the sintering
characteristics of =325 mesh and =-100 +200 mesh nickel powder after
tamping and sintering over the temperature range of 1800 to 2300°F showed
the latter particle-size powder to be the more promising for use in ‘the
core. The finer powder, -325 mesh, was subject to gross shrinkage when
sintered within the indicated temperature range. The first triplex
tube assembled with -100 +200 mesh nickel powder in the annulus was
sintered 1 hr at 2100°F, drawn from 1.000 in. OD to 0.875 in. OD, and
resintered 1 hr at 2100°F. In order to maintain reducing conditions
within the annulus, the tube was continually purged with hydrogen during
sintering. Upon metallographic examination of the tube, however, oxide
layers were found at the interfaces between the sintered material and
tubing. A second triplex tube assembled in the same manner as the first
was evacuated to 0.1 #, sintered for 1 hr at 2100°F, drawn from 1.000
in; OD to 0.938 in. OD, and resintered for 1 hr at 2100°F. Again it
was found that poor bonds were formed between the tubing and the sintered
material and that oxides were present at the interfaces. The difficulties

experienced in achieving an interface bond have been attributed to
oxygen contamination of the nickel powder.
Prefabricated porous materials available from commercial vendors
are to be used in future attempts to prepare triplex tubing.
High-Temperature Stability of INOR-8, Embrittlement studies of

-INOR-8 in the temperature range 1000 and 1400°F are in progress. In

these studies the changes in the tensile properties of annealed sheet
are being determined at various aging times and temperatures. In the
tensile tests completed thus far, specimens aged for 5000 hr have shown
no significant differences from the annealed specimens. Specimens being
aged for 10,000 hr have completed 9000 hr of the heat treatment.
Commercial Production of INOR-8. The fabrication qualities of
INOR-8 melted by the arc-cast method are being evaluated. The starting

‘metal was a standard air-melted heat which was forged into electrodes,

subsequently vacuum arc-melted, and again forged into extrusion billets.
The billets are scheduled to be pierced, extruded, and redrawn into
tubing. INOR-8 prepared by vacuum-induction melting produced extrusion
billets which were unsuitable for further processing because of large
center defects. Upon completion of the present study, INOR-8 will
have been produced by three processes, and a basis will have been established
for placing future orders.

Evaluations of Composites of INOR-8 and Type 316 Stainless Steel.
The compatibility of “INOR-8 and type 316 stainless steel at high
temperatures is being investigated. ‘The evaluation methods include
measurements of the diffusion ‘penetration. of the alloys into each other,
the identification of reaction” layers, & and measurements of the mechani-

‘cal: properties. The. ‘data ‘accumulated ‘thus far indicate that the alloys
are compatible at. temperatures up. to 1800° F. Composites of INOR-8 and

type 316 stainless steel therefore appear to be promising for use in

fused salteto-sodiun heat exchangers.

WELDING AND BRAZING STUDIES

' Heat Exchanger Fabrication. The welding and brazing problems
encountered in constructing a triplex-tube heat exchanger are being
studied, and suitable fabrication procedures are being developed. The
basic design of such a heat exchanger consists of two tube sheets at
each end, with the outer tube wall of each tube welded to one tube
sheet and the inner tube wall of each tube welded to the other tube
sheet. The space between the two tube’ sheets can thus be used for.
leak detection. A difficult access problem is encountered. in the
welding of the outer tube walls to the first header, since conventional
welding torches are too bulky to fit between adjacent tubes.

For experimental welds, an extension was attached to & small
welding torch and a shielding-gas nozzle and a trailer shield were
manufectured from pyrex glass. The tungsten electrode was bent at
an angle of 10 deg to permit placement of the electrode tip and, hence,
the cathode spot, over the tube-to-tube sheet interface.

These torch modifications required that the torch move around its
own axis, as well as around the tube axis, with identical periods of
rotation. A sketch showing the rotational movements required to make
the welds is presented in Fig. 2.1.3. A mechanism was designed and
fabricated to permit this complex rotational motion and a rotating
shielding-gas seal and current contact were enclosed in a suitable
assembly.

a \ ‘mockup ‘heat exchanger was constructed to agsist in the develop-
ment of a welding procedure and to provide information and experience
applicable to the construction of en actual unit. Simulated tubes

were constructed by separating individual stainless steel and Inconel

tubes with wire spacers. The assembly, which was welded and back
brazed successfully, is shown in Fig. 2.1,h.

Welding of INOR-8. A summary report is being prepared in which the
weldability of three nickel-molybdenum-elloys -- Hastelloy B, Eastelloy W,
. end INOR-8 -= is discussed. The report will correlate the information
available on the microstructures of weld metal in the as-velded condition,
the microstructures after aging at 1200, 1300, and 1500°%F, the influence
of ‘aging at these temperatures on the room-temperature hardness, and
the effect of aging at 1200°F on the room- and elevated-temperature strength
end ductility.

Studies are continuing in an effort to improve the high-temperature.
ductility of INOR-8 weld metal. It wag reported previously that all-weld-
metal tensile test specimens of INOR-8 heats from Haynes Stellite Company,
Westinghouse Electric Corporation, and ORNL exhibited essentially the
same mechanical properties in the as-welded condition. The ductility
at 1300°F and above is considered to be marginal.

The effects of warious heat treatments of the specimens were studied,
and the results, summarized in Table 2.1.5, indicate that the ductility

at elevated temperatures was substantially increased. A metallographic
examination indicated that considerable carbide spheroidization occurred
as a result of heat treating at 1500°F and above. The carbide spheroi-
dization may be seen in Fig. 2.1.5. The carbides in the as~welded INOR-8
weld metal appeared to have precipitated extensively along the grain
boundaries, as shown in Fig. 2.1.6. This spheroidization is thought to
be at least partially responsible for the improvement in ductility at
15000F after aging at 1500°F. The 1800°F treatment resulted in slightly
more spheroidization than is shown in Fig. 2.1.5. The microstructural
changes resulting from aging at 1200 and 1500°F will be studied further
with the aid of the electron microscope.

These results indicated that the merginal elevated-temperature
ductility of INOR-8 weld metal in the as-welded condition might result
from an unfavorable carbide distribution, as well as from the influence
of trace elements in the 0.009 to 0.001 wt % range, which are known to
cause "hot shortness" in nickel-base alloys. Special heats of INOR-8
vere therefore prepared, as described below, in order to study each of
the above conditions. |
| Four different methods have been utilized thus far to deoxidize
and purify the weld filler metal during the casting of the original
ingot. These are: (1) use of Inconel weld wire (Inco. No. 62) as the
source of most of the nickel, chromium, and iron, (2) use of nickel
weld wire (Inco. No. 61) as the source of all the nickel, (3) addition
of en &luminum-titaniun-manganese master alloy to purify the melt
(process recommended by Electro Metallurgical Company), and (4) additions
of aluminum, titanitm, manganese, silicon, boron, and magnesium to
purify ‘the melt (as recomended by International Nickel Company) . The
results. obtained to date on ‘as-deposited INOR-8 are shown in Table 2.1.6.

As may be seen in Table 2.1.6, all the methods described above for
deoxidizing and purifying the ingot have shown promising results. The
ductility at 1500°F has been increased from an average value of T% to
13 to 15%. Other modifications in melting practice will be investigated
in an effort to obtain a ductility at 1500°F of 20%.

In order to determine the influence of carbon content on the duc-
tility, vacuum-induction melts conteining 0.00+%, 0.03%, and 0.06%
carbon were made, fabricated into weld wire, and deposited as weld
metal. The results of the all-weld-metal tensile tests of these speci-
mens are summarized in Table 2.1.7. The data show that no increase in

high-temperature ductility was attained by decreasing the carbon content
of the INOR-8 weld deposit. Also, when no carbon addition to the ingot
was made, the ductility values at room temperature and at 1200°F were
seriously diminished. These poor ductilities are assumed to result
from e preponderance of grain-boundary films (probably oxides) « These
films were of such a magnitude that grain-boundary fissures were numer
ous. The properties of lower-carbon-content melts should also be
investigated when melted with improved practices of the type discussed

Welding of Dissimilar Metals. The problem of selecting & suitable filler
material for welding dissimilar metals has often been an obstacle in the
fabrication of various components. A dissimilar metal weld is composed
not only of filler metal, but substantial quantities of both of the base
materials being joined. The filler metal should thus have the following
properties: (1) high tolerance for dilution by elements such as iron,
nickel, chromium, and copper without forming brittle or crack-sensitive
alloys, (2) a moderate coefficient of thermal expansion, (3) ability to
withstand high service temperatures over long periods of time without
suffering from harmful effects such as sigme-phase formation and carbon
migration, (4) good oxidation and corrosion resistance, and (5) good
strength and ductility over the temperature ranges of interest.

The International Nickel Company has developed such & filler wire
for inert-arc welding of dissimilar metals, and the mechanical properties
have been studied and reported.’ The high titanium content of the wire
mekes it highly susceptible to age hardening at the molten-salt reactor
service temperature of 1200°F, and its application may, therefore, be r
limited.

A niobium-contsining coated electrode, designated Inco Weld "A"
electrode, was algo developed for the metallic-arc welding of dissimilar
metals, and the mechanical properties were determined in both the as-
welded and as-aged conditions. The results of this study are shown
in Table 2.1.8. As would be expected from the composition, the metallic~-
arc weld deposits are not subject -to appreciable aging. The tensile
strength at room and elevated temperatures is not appreciably eltered,
and the ductility is not decreased. It thus appears that this electrode
might be useful for joining dissimilar metals for high-temperature

Pump Component Fabrication. A metallographic study of numerous

* molybdenum-to-Inconel brazed joints has been conducted in connection
~ with the fabrication of a pump-shaft extension.’ Molybdenum sheets
1/8 in. thick and of varying sizes were brazed to 1/2-in.-thick
Inconel plates with Coast Metals No. 52 alloy, copper, and an 82 vt %
Au-18 wt % Ni alloy. Examinations of the samples were conducted
visually and metallographically after brazing and after thermally
cycling 15 times from 1200°F. |
It was found that extreme stresses are built up in the molybdenum~-
to~Inconel brazed joints from differential thermal expansion (molybdenum,

2.9 x 10” -6 in./in./°F; Inconel, 8.7 x 10° 6 in. /in./F). The stresses
may cause severe cracking along the center of the brazed joint, along
 

 

- 97 -

the brazing alloy-molybdenum interface, or in the molybdenum base
material. As would be expected, the cracking tendencies. are decreased
as the area of contact decreases.

Joints brazed with copper exhibited no cracks after brazing, but"
numerous transverse and longitudinal cracks in the joint were noted on

all specimens which were cycled 15 times from 1200°F to room temper-

ature. It appears that the copper lacks adequate strength and ductility

at the elevated temperatures to accommodate the stresses built up in
thermal cycling.

The stronger, less ductile alloy, Au-Ni, was characterized by
longitudinal cracks along the joint. In many cases, the molybdenum
base metal near the joint was also cracked.

~ Joints brazed with Coast Metals No. 52 alloy, a strong, brittle
material, showed varied properties. In most samples, only slight
cracking was observed after thermal cycling, while severe cracking
was noted in one sample. The fillets were subject to cracking in most
cases.

Since Coast Metals Nc. 52 alloy appeared to be the most promising
of the three brazing alloys tested for this application, a prototype
pump shaft and extension were constructed. The conditions of the
test unit will be limited, however, since some of the molybdenum fingers

were cracked during machining.

2.2. CHEMISTRY AND RADIATION DAMAGE

PHASE EQUILIBRIUM STUDIES

Systems Containing UF, and/or ThF). Phase studies are being conducted
to determine whether the NaF -BeF,-ThF) -UF) system has any advantages over
the LiF-BeF,-ThF) -UF) system as a fuel for a graphite-moderated one-reglon
reactor. Investigations of the phase relationships in the system NaF-

BeF =ThF), have shown that they are grossly similar to those derived for

the syste NaF -BeF,,-UF, by the Mound Leboratory.™ The choice of Ne-BeF,-
ThF) mixtures for use in nuclear reactor systems is limited to compositions
baving liquidus temperatures of 550°C or lower, and thus the THF), concen-
tration is restricted to the range 10 to 15 mole %. All observations of
the effect of UF), substitution for ThF), in solid solutions (LiF-THF) -
UF)y LF -BeF,-ThF), -UF),, NaF-ThF, <UF),) have indicated that UF), substi-
tution causes the liquidus temperature of the resultant solid solution
to be lowered. It would appear, therefore, that the liquid temperatures
encountered in the system NaF -BeF,-ThF) repregent maximum temperatures
to be encountered for the liquidus as UF), is substituted for part of
the ThF), in NaF -BeF,-ThF) mixtures. |

The System LiF-PuF_. Chemical analyses of filtrates from saturated

effects on cooling curves from l-g samples has been developed to study
phase relationships in these and similar systems. Thermal enalyses of
LiF-Puf, mixtures containing 5 to 38 mole % PuF, show a single eutectic
at 19.5 mole % PuF,, which melts at T43 + 2°C. Examinations of slowly-
cooled mixtures by means of a polarizing microscope mounted in a glove
box aided in the location of the eutectic composition and showed no
evidence of compounds or solid solutions in this system. |

The System KF-LiF-BeF,. The possibility of using low-melting
point mixtures in the system KF-LiF-BeF, as coolants for nuclear
reactors was studied. Such mixtures would be attractive because of
the lower gamma activity they would nave in comparison vith similar
NaF-base mixtures after irradiation in a reactor.

Examinations of 12 melts from thermal analysis experiments by
the use of optical and x-ray techniques showed that the system KF-LiF-
BeF, contains two ternary compounds which have the probable formulas

KF+LiF*BeF, and KF .LiF -2BeF,. Phases present in the cooled melts

The vapor pressure at 900 to 988° C of an equimolar mixture of fuel

the unmixed fluids. The material distilled from the mixture consists
of fluorides and chlorides of Li, Rb, and Be and about 0.2 at. % U.

It is obvious that no compounds of low boiling point result.

Mixtures of coolant and fuel contained so little uranium that
examinations of quenched specimens did not demonstrate whether a urenium
compound was the primary phase. Quenching of mixtures of this coolant
with an LiF-BeF,,-UF, (67-28-5 mole %) fuel mixture containing more
uranium showed that Li,BeF) is the primary phase from pure fuel to
below 50 mole % fuel in the mixture. The liquidus temperatures dropped
from 440°C for the pure fuel to below 360°C for a mixture with 25 mole

primary phase at reactor temperatures.

An experiment was completed to determine whether the method used to
remove relatively large amounts of SuF 5 from: LiF-BeF,-UF) (62.8-36.4=
0.8 mole %) would be satisfactory for the removal of trace amounts.

of molten-fluoride-salt reactor fuels. Attempts to precipitate UO,
Prom solutions of UF) (6.5 wt % U) in LiF-BeF, (63-37 mole %) by
treatment with excess Be0 have shown that the UF), content of the melt
decreases rapidly at first but that the precipitation rate becomes
very slow after about 30 min; less than 40% of the UF) precipitates
in 3 hr. It is likely that the BeO becomes coated with Uo, and that
the reaction is effectively prevented. The surface area of the BeO
should, accordingly, prove to be an important variable.
Sparging such an incompletely reacted system with HF in an
attempt to redissolve the precipitated uo, appeared to accelerate
the precipitation of Uo, In a typical experiment the UF), content
of the melt was reduced from 6.5% to 4.4% U by 3 hr of contact with
excess BeO at 600°C and was further reduced to 2.9% U by 3 hr of
sparging with HF at this temperature. A possible explanation for
this bebavior is that the HF is capable of exposing additional surface
area of the BeO pellets previously coated with insoluble uo, and
thereby accelerating the reaction. An alternate and equally likely
explanation is that HF serves as an intermediate reactant which
reacts with BeO to produce E0 and bring about precipitation of U0.

CHEMISTRY OF THE CORROSION PROCESS

 

Activity Ceefficients of CrFy in NaF-ZTF . The activity coef-
ficients of the fluorides of structural metals such as chromium,
nickel, and iron dissolved in dilute solutions of molten fluorides
are of interest to the understanding and prediction of corrosion
reactions taking place in systems in which molten fluorides are in
contact with alloys of these metals. The activity coefficients of

FeF,, and NiF, dissolved in molten NaF-ZrF) (53-47 mole %) were determined

and reported previously.’ The activity coefficients of CrF, in the
same solvent were determined at 850°C (ref 6) and at 750°C (ref 7),
and the activity coefficients determined at 800°c are reported here.
The study of the activity coefficients of C1F, in this solvent, as
originally planned, was concluded with these measurements.

The average equilibrium quotients and activity coefficients for

| CrF, in NeF-ZrF, (53-47 mole %) at 850, 800, and 750°C are summarized

in Table 2.2.2. The equilibrium constants listed for reaction 2

in Table 2.2.2 represent simply the arithmetic averages of the
experimentally determined equilibrium quotients. Since no significant
effect was noted with changes of CrF, concentration, the arithmetic
averages may be considered as equilibrium constants obtained by
extrapolation to infinite dilution.
Chromium Diffusion in Alloys. For the ultimate understanding
of the corrosion mechanism and prediction of corrosion rates occurring
in systems containing molten fluoride solutions in contact with ’
chromium-bearing alloys, it is necessary to determine the various
factors that affect the diffusion rates of chromium in the alloys.
As a first step of a systematic study of the fundamental corrosion
processes, techniques have been developed and described’ to determine

self-diffusion coefficients of chromium in chromium-nickel alloys

with Cr’ las a radiotracer.

As was reported previously, the magnitudes of the diffusion
coefficients obtained from experiments conducted with specimens
which had been polished but not hydrogen fired were one to two orders

Sampling of Operating Loops. Two forced-circulation loops for
corrosion testing of materials in circulating fluoride salts were
equipped during the quarter with devices which provide for frequent
sampling of the circulating salt during loop operation, One loop
equipped with a sampling device was fabricated from INOR-8 and the
other from Inconel. Both loops were charged with a salt composed
of LiF-BeF,-~ThF) UF) (62-36.5~1-0.5 mole %).

Salt samples are being taken from these loops, while they are
operating, with gradually decreasing frequency. The samples taken
from the INOR-8 loop during the first 1000 hr of operation showed
a slow but steady increage of chromium in the salt from about 420
to 530 ppm. For the Inconel loop, the increase in the chromium
content of the salt was somewhat more rapid, ‘with the chromium content
in the salt having increased from about 350 to about 450 ppm in 500
hr of operation. Operation of these loops is continuing. In neither

objective of the experiments is to determine the thermodynamic

ascertain the molecular species in the vapor. The LiF-BeF, system,
because of complex: association in the vapor phase, is not amenable

ALUMINUM CHLORIDE VAPOR AS A HEAT TRANSFER MEDIUM AND TURBINE WORKING

Estimation of Thermodynamic Properties. Gaseous aluminum chloride
under a pressure of 1 atm consists almost entirely of Al Cle at
L450°F, whereas at 1200°F the fraction dissociated is O.7« The
resulting increases in specific heat and thermal conductivity make:
this gas attractive as a working fluid for a turbine. In the pre=-

effective specific heat, thermal conductivity, and viscosity of the
gas at various temperatures and pressures were presented. These
calculations were extended considerably during the quarter and are

the equilibria of possible mechanisms for the corrosion of metals by
gaseous AlCl, are also presented in the report. t The velocity of
- sound (ec o) ‘in the gaseous medium, which would be an important parame-
ter in turbine design, was calculated from the expressions

ec.’ = v/s ’
where v is the specific volume of the gas in em3/g and p is the
pressure of the gas. The term (3v/3 Plg was evaluated at constant
entropy (8) from standard thermodynamic relationships and the
equation of state for an ideal associating gas.

The calculations indicate that aluminum chloride is probably
an attractive gaseous heat transfer medium and that it would require
very low pumping power. As a working fluid for a turbine, the rele
tively large difference of the specific volume of the gas at the
high and low temperatures of the cycle, as compared with a working
fluid that does not associate, minimizes the effect of inefficiencies
of the pump and turbine system.

Corrosion of Nickel by ACL. Experimental investigations of
the compatibility of aluminum chloride and structural metals were
continued. Aluminum chloride gas wes held at a pressure of about
1 atm for 850 hr in a capsule of metallic nickel whose ends were
maintained at temperatures of 670 and 450°C, respectively. A very
small metallic deposit, which was. identified spectrographically es
nickel, was found on the capsule well in the 450°C zone. It is
likely that this deposit was formed by the temperature-sensitive

reversible ‘reaction

which was described previously. 3 The quantity of material deposited
could account for very little attack in the hot zone. Photomicrographs
of the capsule showed general and intergranular attack in the 670°C
zone, with the maximum penetration of the intergranular attack being
to a depth of about 1 mile No subsurface voids were observed.

Further examinstion of the capsule after completion of the experi=
ment indicated that a cold spot was present on the capsule near the
670°C zone during the run. It is possible that condensation of NiCl,
on this cold spot could have resulted in increased corrosion of the
wall,’

PERMEABILITY OF GRAPHITE BY MOLTEN FLUORIDE MIXTURES

 

Previous reports in this series have described tests in which
reactor-grade graphite was impregnated by exposing out-gassed specimens
to molten LiF-MgF,, or NeF=LiF-KF mixtures at 1700°F for several hours
under inert gas at a pressure of about 20 psig. In order to ascertain
whether such treatment protects the graphite from penetration by reactor
fuel mixtures, 0.5- and 1.0-in.-die specimens impregnated with the
salt mixture LiF-MgF, (67.5-32.5 mole %; mp, 1350°F) were exposed at
1250° F for 800 hr to a typical fuel mixture, LiF-BeF, ~UF), (62-37-1
mole %).

No evidence of gains or losses in weight of the graphite specimens
resulted from exposure to the fuel mixture. However, chemical ‘analyses
of successive 1/32-in. layers machined from the specimens indicate

that penetration of the fuel mixture had occurred. The beryllium concen-

tration of the successive layers decreased from 5000 ppm in the outer
layer to 2000 ppm in the center of the rod; the uranium concentration
similarly decreased from 3500 to 1000 ppm. These figures indicate that
nearly two-thirds of the LiF-MgF,, in the outer layer of the specimen

was replaced by the fuel. The ratio of beryllium to uranium was sub-
stantially lower in the center of the graphite than in the fuel mixtures ’
but it is evident that impregnating graphite with LiF-MgF, will not
satisfactorily prevent the subsequent penetration by LiF-BeF,~UF) mixtures.

EFFECTS OF THERMAL CYCLING ON SALT STABILITY

A series of tests was run with sealed nickel capsules to determine

the effects on beryllium~containing salt mixtures of freezing and

remelting, without agitation. The mixtures LiF-BeF oUF), (62-37-1 mole %),
LAF-BeF ,~ThF), (71-16-13 mole %), and LiF-BeF,~ThF) -UF) (62+3645-1-0.5
mole %) were tested. In one set of experiments, the salts were held

at 1250°F under static conditions for 25, 100, and 500 hr. In another
set, the salts were ‘thermally cycled five times from 400 to 850, 1000,
1200, and 1400°F, respectively. The maximum temperature of the cycle

was held for 30 min before cooling was started. All tests were run in
duplicate.

Analyses of sections from the salts held at 1250°F for varying
periods of time shoved no detectable change in composition. The salts
which were sub jected to thermal: cycling shoved, however, definite
increases in: uranium and/or thorium content in the bottom sections of
the capsules, ’ with a corresponding decrease in lithium and beryllium
content. The degree of. concentration of w, or Thr), in the bottom sections

RADIATION DAMAGE STUDIES

INOR=-8 Thermal-Convection Loop for Operation in the LITR. The ine
pile thermal-convection loop constructed for testing fused-salt fuels
in an INOR-8 system in the LITR was operated in preliminary out-ofe-pile
tests, and satisfactory circulation was obtained. The loop was filled
with solid fuel, which was melted in place. Removal of gas bubbles
from the fuel was found to be & problem but was accomplished by pressure :
~ changes brought about by alternately refrigerating and warming the

charcoal-adsorber bed of the loop. During radiographic exaninations
of the loop to determine the extent of gas removal, a dense deposit
was noted at the bottom of the lower bend, which is presumably Uo,
“The amount of UO, observed would generate an intolerable amount of heat
at that point if the loop were operated in-pile. Examination of the
batch of fuel from which this loop filling was obtained revealed Uo,
deposits on the surfaces of some pieces. Analyses indicate that the
fuel circulating in the loop is free of U0, A second ineplle loop is
being assembled that will be filled with selected pieces of UO, ~free
fuel. .

In~Pile Static Corrosion Test o Two INOR«8 capsules that had been
filled with LiF-BeF,~UF), (62-37-1 mole %) and shipped to the MIR for
irradiation were found upon arrival to have suffered mechanical damage
to the thermocouples that prevented their insertion. These capsules

are being repaired.
PREPARATION OF PURIFIED MATERIALS

Fluorides of Chromium. Chromous fluoride of good purity results
 

 

 

 

-.113--
from the reaction of molten stannous fluoride with chromium metal.t?
The container material needed for the reaction is "graphitite," an
expensive, low=porosity grade of graphite; stannous fluoride melts

leak through containers of ordinary graphite. If cadmium fluoride or
bismuth trifluoride is substituted for the stannous fluoride in the
reaction, comparable yields (over 90%) of chromous fluoride are obtained
in crucibles of ordinary graphite, Molten cupric fluoride and leed
fluoride also react with chromium metal to form chromous fluoride, but
the yields are lower, probably as a result of loss of material by leak-
age through graphite. Cadmium metal volatilizes from the charge when
CdF, ls used as the oxidant. When the other oxidants are used, the

salt and metal separate into well-defined layers.

Batches of less than 40 g of chromous fluoride are conveniently
prepared by maintaining chromic fluoride at 1100°C in a platinum or
graphite container for 4 hr. The yield of chromous fluoride is con=
sistent with the equation

CF —> 2CrF, + CrFy .

Attempts to prepare large batches of CrF, by the disproportionation

of CrFq at 1100°C for a limited time » however, yield a product whose

composition is intermediate between CrF, and CrFae This intermediate
fluoride has also resulted from (1) partial reduction of CrFy by By
and (2) partial oxidation of CrF, ‘by HF. It can apparently be prepared

in nearly pure form by treatment of ‘CrF, with SoF, or by reaction of

Cr, CrCly, or CrCl; with en excess of SuF,. The yellowish green crystals

of this compound are biaxial negative and show a distinctive x-ray

 

pattern by which the compound can be identified readily. Chemical

analysis shows the F/Cr atom ratio to be 2.4. The compound may plausibly

The reaction, presumebly, is CL

5CrF, + -SuF,—> Cr 3{(CrFg)y + Sn

The oxidation does not proceed further, even if a kook excess of SnF,
is provided.

Synthesis of Simple Fluorides by Reactions with Stannous Fluoride.
Stannous fluoride is also useful for synthesizing fluorides of other
metals in a low valence state. Molten stannous fluoride was reacted
with manganese, zinc, aluminum, iron, vanadium, and uranium to yield,
respectively, MnF,,, ZnF, 09 ALF, FeF,, VF, and UF), The equation for

e typical reaction is

Mn + SnF—> MoF,, +80

The mangesnous and zinc fluorides prepared by this procedure were pure,
since the molten salt and the tin resulting in the reaction formed
well«defined layers which were easily separated. The reaction of the
uranium metal with stannous fluoride was so vigorous that the molten
product was spattered about,

Experimental-Scale Purification Operations. Small-scale processing
of various molten fluoride salts for use in corrosion tests, physical
property studies, and small-scale component testing continued in the
experimental facilities located in Building 9201-3 and Building 9928.

A total of 265 kg of mixtures without beryllium and 73 kg of beryllium
containing compositions was processed during the quarter.

Transfer and Service Operations. Service operations were about
normal during the quarter, with approximately 98 kg of liquid metals
and 1123 kg of fluoride salt mixtures being dispensed, Approximately
112 operations were involved in the normal processes of filling, draining,
and sampling various test equipment. | |

2.3. FUEL PROCESSING

A process for the recovery of the fuel and blanket salts of a molten=-
salt reactor is being developed that is based on the volatilization of
uranium as UF and on the appreciable solubility of LiF-BeF,, salts in
nearly anhydrous HF. Previously reported work indicated this procedure
to be generally appliceble to molten~salt reactor systems employing
LiF-BeF,-UF), or LiF-BeF,-UF) ~ThF) salts. The process is particularly
promising in the degree of separation of the recovered LiF-BeF, salt
from important rare-earth neutron poisons as a result of the general
insolubility of polyvalent-element fluorides in anhydrous HF. A |
tentative process flowsheet was presented previously.

Studies of the behavior of neptunium, uranium, thorium, and
corrosion=product fluorides have been made in further development work on
the HF salt-dissolution process. The results appear to be consistent
with the proposed process flowsheet in that the recovered LiF-BeF, salt
would effectively be deconteminated from neptunium. Much further investi~
gatior of some of the variables involved will be necessary, however,

before specific flowsheets for specific reactor designs can be “prepared.
SOLUBILITY OF NEPTUNIUM IN AQUEOUS HF SOLUTIONS
The rate of neptuniun buildup in a v3 burner reactor increases

with time ag a result of buildup of the ‘parent P36 isotope. After 20
years ’ the neptunium concentration will be approximately 0.015 mole %

if ‘there is ‘continuous removal one once-per=year cycle, For such a
reactor, the neptunium would contribute about 40% as much poisoning as

contributed by all fission fragments at that time.2

The solubility of neptunium in 80 to 100% BF solvents saturated
with LiF and BeF, was found experimentally to be sufficiently low to
permit its removal along with the rare earths. In the experiments,
small quantities of neptunium (aqueous nitrate solution) were added
incrementally to EF solutions saturated with LiF and BeF,. The concen-
tration of nitrate added was epproximately 0.02% of the fluoride salt
concentration. The observed solubilities of neptunium are reported

in Table 2.3.1 as milligrams of neptunium per gram of solution and as

with the neptunium to a considerable extent; the ratio of the amount of
plutonium in solution to the amount undissolved was within a factor of
2 of the ratio for neptunium although the plutonium concentration was
500 times smaller. |
Additions of iron and nickel metal to the HF solutions resulted
in a significant reduction in the gross alphe activity, probably as the
result of reduction to neptunium (III) and to plutonium (III). The
reduction has not yet been verified by neptunium pulse-height analyses.
In the trivalent state, behavior somewhat similar to that of the rare
earths might be expected; the observed solubilities are in the same
range as those reported previously for rare earths. It is expected
that the rare earths, neptunium, plutonium, and, possibly, uranium will
behave 8s a single group and will therefore exhibit lower solubilities
when present together than the values reported here for the separate

components.
SOLUBILITY OF CORROSION-PRODUCT FLUORIDES IN HF SOLVENT

Measurements were made of the solubilities of corrosion~product
fluorides (iron, chromium, and nickel) in HF solutions saturated with
LiF. Chromium fluoride vas found to be relatively soluble, with the .
solubilities being about: 8, 12; ‘and 18 ng of chromium per gram of
solution in 100, 95, and 90. wo %: ‘BF. solvents, respectively. Iron and
nickel fluorides were. “found to ‘be less soluble. The iron fluoride

 

solubility. values varied from 0.08. to 2 ng of ‘iron per gram of solution;
the average deviation of the values, neglecting extreme velues, was

0.14 + 0.10. “The ‘nickel fluoride solubility varied from 0.01 to 1.3

‘mg. of nickel per. ‘gram of ‘solution, ‘the, average being Q. 15 + 0.06. The
results vere 80: inconsistent that no trend with HF concentration could
be established, “When iron, nickel, and ‘chromiun fluorides were present

together, the solubilities of all appeared to be somewhat lower.

Similar measurements in 90 and 100 wt % HF solvents with no dissolved
salt gave values in the same range, but in the 80 wt % HF solvent the
iron and nickel solubilities appeared to be significantly higher.

SOLUBILITIES OF URANIUM AND THORIUM TETRAFLUORIDE IN HF SOLVENT

Measurements of the solubilities of thorium and uranium fluorides
in the HF solvents indicated that these fluorides are relatively insolu-
ble. All THF), determinations gave less than 0.03 mg of thorium per
gram of solution, which is the limit of detection. Better analytical
methods are available for UF), and the solubility values were, in general,
in the range 0.005 to 0.010 mg of uranium per gram of solution. In the
presence of fresh iron or nickel metal, somewhat lower solubilities
(0.002 to 0.005) were observed, indicating, perbaps, a higher solubility
for higher oxidation states. |
