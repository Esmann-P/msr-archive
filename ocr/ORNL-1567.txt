Heavy Isotope Burld-Up In Core of y233 Breeder

Jo Halperin and R. W. Stoughton

Abstract

The build-up of uramum isotopes with time in a 233 breeder core
was calculated for five different cases, the difference depending on the
starting fuel and the isotopic composition of the continuously added
make-up fuels The total uranium concentration was found to approach
slowly an equilibrium value of 2,6 to 3.5 times the starting value,
depending on the composition of the make-up fuel. In all cases the net
neutron losses per net neutron reproduced in the core go through a
maximum of less than 1% at a flux-taime of about 3 x 1021, go through a
mimmum of about -0,6% (1.€. a net gain) at about a flux-time of
Lh x 1022, and approach equilibrium values of about 0,3% at flux-times

above 6 x 1023,

The principle heavy isotopes in the core of a 233 breeder reactor and their
modes of formation may be depicted by the following diagram,

| (n, fiss,) | a, fiss,) p- len day

The production of these species as well as of several other heavy miclides in

the core of a breeder starting with pure y233 has been discussed by vasner(1)

the net effect on neutron economy were presented In this paper five cases will
be considered with more recent values for the various cross-sections
To Pure ye33 in core at start, pure y233 added to core,
IT. Pure y233 in core at start, ye33 containing 5% y23b added to core as
the fuel 1s consumed,
ITI. y233 containing 5% y23b in core at start and added to core.
IVe Pure 235 in core at start, pure 233 added to core.
Vo Pure U°S> in core at start, 233 contaimng 5% y23l added to cores
In any practical case the core will probably start with 235 x, As this
material 1s consumed y235 will be added at first, and then very soon the added
material should consist of the ye33 product produced in the blanket, Some y23l

will be produced in the blanket by neutron capture of the members of the 233

 

* Actually this starting material will contain about 1.0% 23h, 93% p35 and 6%
y238, The 23k and y238 wll increase the losses over those calculated in this
paper for Cases IV and V at the shorter times, the magnitude of this additional
loss will be about 0,17% at zero time and 1t will steadily decrease with

increasing time.

chain (Th233, Pa233 and 0233) and 1t 1s felt that an upper limit on the y23l/y233
ratio for the blanket product will be about 0.05 if the overall losses are to
be kept within reason. Hence any practical case 1s expected to lie somewhere
in between Cases IV and V (Cases I, II and III are included for comparison and
because some future reactors may actually start with 233 1n the core The
effect of U237 will not be considered because 1t 18 expected to be destroyed
predomnantly by beta decay and 1ts cross-sections are not known, Its concen-
trations and possible effects have been considered in a previous paper (1)

For Case I the concentration of 233 1s considered constant. Actually its
concentration will increase somewhat as various pile poisons (e.g. fission products,
23k etc.) grow in and 1ts concentration may then decrease somewhat in the core
as 1t increases in the blanket. If the core and blanket are processed
continuously, however, these effects will reach a steady state value rather soon,
if they are processed batchwise, then the tame average value will be constant
from period to period. The effect of the heavy isotope build-up 1tself on
required ye33 concentration changes 1s small as will be seen from the small effect
of this build-up on neutron economy,

The values of the various cross-sections used here are given in Table 1,

Here there are three contributions to some of the isotopes (1) that
resulting from the original y235, the Ng part, (2) that resulting from neutron
reactions on the y233 added, the N, part, and (3) that resulting from the 23h
added with the p33, the Ny parte The contributions (1) and (2) have already
been evaluated in Case IV. Item (3) will now be considered and then added to
the other two. For this contribution it 1s necessary to know the rate of
addition of ye33 and not just 1ts concentration which 1s fixed by Equation (12),

v
Using Equation (13) and differentiating Equation (12) gives the net rate of
change of p233

But U233 is destroyed at the rate of Np3t Op (23). Hence the total rate of
addition of 233 is
KNpLE O74 (25) + Np3f 03(23)
since the net rate of change of p233 = rate of addition - rate of destruction.
The rate of addition of p23 1s r times the rate of addition of y233 (where r
1s the y23L 233 ratio in the blanket product). Using Equation (12) with the
above expression for the total rate of adding y233 the rate of addition of
y23h becomes
rkNSef C (25) = rNp3f(07,(25) ~ 07(23))

The first term in the brackets 1s a constant and the second one varies as Np3e
As wll be seen, the calculations may be somewhat simplified if Equation (20)
1s broken up into two equations, one involving the constant production term and
the other a negative variable "production" term. Let

Equation (20b) 1s similar to Equation (1) wath Np3 being given by Equation (15).
Equations similar to (2) and (3) can be written for (N35) gs (Nog)ys (Nag) and
(N26 )ye The total solutaon for No), will then be a superposition of the solution
given by Equation (L) and that given by Equation (16), that for Nos a super-
position of the solutions given by Equations (5) and (17), that for Nogs a
superposition of the solutions given by Equations (6) and (18). The contribution
to the loss term of the effects of Np, Nog and Nog will likewise be a super-
position of L(23) given by Equation (7) and the L' (25) part of Equation (19).

Since the solution to the differential equation

1t 1s clear that the solution of the differential equation differing only from
the above by a multiplicative constant in Kj will differ in its solution from
the above by this same multiplicative constant in Kj. The coefficients of the
superposed solutions are simply the ratios of the coefficients to N, and

N, (1 = e~Ta(25)Tty in the "production" terms in Equations (20a) and (20b) to

A summary of the maximum losses (all at about ft = 3 x 103), the minimum
losses (all at about ft = 4 x 1022) and the equilibrium losses (attained at
about ft = 6 x 1023) are presented in Table 2, In the last column of Table 2
are presented the ratios of the total uramunm to ye33 at equilibrium, these
values are 2,60 1f pure 1233 1s added to the core as fuel 1s burned and 3.50
if y233 containing 5% y23h 1s added, Since these two values probably represent
the two extremes (within the accuracy of the cross-sections and] values used)
the most likely value may be about 3,0. Depending on the concentration ranges
being considered, this increase in total uranium could cause increased corrosion
rates or solubility troubles. In aqueous homogeneous 0233 breeder reactors
the uramum concentration ranges anticipated (a few grams per later) are low
enough so that a three-fold increase probably will not cause any appreciable
harm,

The losses presented in Fig. L are instantaneous values at any given ft,

 
-15 =
The integrated average losses up to any ft value in question are presented in
Fige 5 for Cases I and III, as mentioned previously these two cases probably
represent extremes between which any practical case will lie. The integrated
losses are negative (showing a small net neutron gain): between ft values of
about 2 x 1022 and 5 x 1023, For a reactor with a core flux of about 1.5 x 1015
and wath a total fuel hold-up (in core,heat exchanger, chemical processing, etc.)
of 4 or & times that in the core, an ft of 1022 corresponds to about one year's
operation. Hence for such a reactor the integrated net effect of the heavy
1sotope build-up 1s to cause a small neutron gain from about the second to the

fiftieth year of operation,
