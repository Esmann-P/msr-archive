FOREWORD

A molten-salt-breeder reactor was evaluated at the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory beginning in 1959. Because a number of the features postulated
had not been demonstrated at that time, the realization of a breeder ap-
peared to lie rather far in the future. Accordingly, the study of the
near-term, one-region, one-fluid molten-salt converter described in this
report was begun in July 1961 and completed in December 1962. Since then,
several advances have been made in molten-salt technology which make the
breeder reactor much less remote and modify some of the conclusions in
this report.

Briefly, these advances include:

1. Progress in core graphite design which greatly simplifies previ-
ous problems of separating the core into two regions — one for the uranium-
bearing fuel salt and one for the thorium-bearing blanket salt. The new
design utilizes a liquid-lead seal around the tops of graphite tubes con-
taining fuel salt that allows the tubes to expand or contract freely while
maintaining an absolute seal between fuel and blanket fluids.¥* The addi-
tion of a blanket results in a much better conversion than obtained in
this report and leads directly to an attractive breeder.

2. Thermal engineering studies which show that the Loeffler boiler
system can advantageously be replaced by a supercritical boiler. Thermal
stress problems are reduced, overall thermodynamic efficiency is increased,
and capital costs are considerably reduced. In addition, studies of so-

dium metal and of mixtures of alkali carbonates show that if either of

_ these inexpensive materials can be safely used for the intermediate cool-

ant in place of the costly lithium-beryllium fluoride mixtures postulated

in this study, then further large cost reductions can be realized t

3. A fuel purification process based on simple distillationT which
not only reduces processing costs? but permits reuse of the carrier
salts — an advantage not assumed in this study.

As a result of these developments, we believe that fuel cycle costs
for a two-region breeder based on 1965 technology will be only 0.3 to 0.4
mill** compared to the 0.68 mill/kwhr shown in Table 6.10 for the MSCR.

ABSTRACT

 

The MSCR is a one-region, one-fluid, graphite-moderated
converter reactor fueled with a mixture of the fluorides of
thorium uranium, lithium-7, and beryllium which is circulated
through the 20-ft-diam core to an external heat exchanger.
Heat is transferred through an intermediate salt-coolant to
= steam at 2400 psi, 1000°F in a Loeffler boiler system having

a net thermal efficiency of 41.5%. Spent fuel is processed
by fluorination (at 0.08 mill/kwhe) for recycle of isotopes
of uranium. The stripped salt is discardéd.

4

A capital investment of $143/kwe (3.0 mills/kwhe), an
operation and meintenance annual expense of $2.1 million
(0.3 mill/kwhe), and a minimum fuel cycle cost of 0.7 mill/
kwhe (optimum conversion ratio is ~0.9) were estimated, giv-
ing a net power cost of 4.0 mills/kwhe. . All costs were based
on 1962 bases ground rules.

 

 

Second generation plants may have capital costs as low
as $125/kwe. Conversion ratios slightly greater than one
can be obtained in. advanced designs.

: This study was completed in December 1962 and does not
DT reflect increased feasibility and superior performance of
two-region, two-fluid molten salt breeder reactors made pos-
sible by recent (January 1965) advances in core design, heat
transfer, and fuel-salt processing.

“1.” SUMMARY

The Molten Salt Converter Reactor (MSCR) is a one-region, one-fluid,
near-term reactor that does not require any technology beyond the scale-up
- of that already developed at ORNL or to be demonstrated in the MSRE.. Sa- .-

lient characteristics are given in Table 1.1.

1.1 Description

The reactor vessel is fabricated of INOR-8 alloy and is filled with
cylindrical graphite logs 8 inches in diameter and 24 inches long. The
fuel, a mixture of the fluorides of 7Li, Be, Th, and U flows upward through
the passages around the logs and is discharged through eight pumps to an
equal number of heat exchangers where the heat is transferred to an inter-
mediate-salt coolant. Saturated steam is superheated in a shell-and-tube
exchanger; part of the steam is routed to the turbines; the rest is re-
circulated to Loeffler boilers where saturated steam is generated by in-
Jecting the superheated steam into water. Thus, thermal contact of the
coolant salt with subcooled, boiling water is avoided, and thermal stress
in the tube walls is tolerable. The thermal efficiency is in excess of
40%. Twenty-five hundred Mw of heat are extracted from a single core at

average power densities in the fuel salt of not more than 35 w/cm?.

1.2 Fuel Reprocessing

Irradiated fuel is removed from the reactor daily, collected into.
processing batches, and treated with fluorine for recovery of isotopes of
uranium (fully decontaminated) as the hexafluoride. The stripped salt is
discarded. Recovered UFg is reduced to UF, , blended with fresh salt, and
recycled to the reactor. Net burnup and loss of fissile material are com-

pensated by addition of 95% enriched 235U.
1.3 Nuclear and Thermel Performance

The limiting criteria (e. -g+, maximum allowable fuel temperature, maxi-
mum allowable thermal stress in graphite, ete. ) were chosen conservatively
throughout, and provide considerable margin for improvement in later de-
signs. The key variables (core diameter, volume fraction of fuel in core,
carbon} thorium ratio, and processing rate) were optimized with respect to
the fuel cycle cost. Characteristics of the optimized system are listed’

in Table 1.1 where it is seen that the optimum conversion ratio is 0.9,

with slightly permeable graphite that absorbs 12°Xe only slowly.

 
 

1.4 Fuel Cycle Cost

The estimation of inventory and replacement charges for the MSCR is
straightforward.

processing contributes only a small part of the total fuel cost, and the

Processing costs are less well defined; however, the

aggregaté is not sensitive to large errors in the processing cost esti-
mates.

A central Fluoride Volatility facility capable of processing 30 £43 /
day of salt was designed and costed. Only isotopes of uranium are re-
covered; carrier salt and thorium are discarded along with fission pro-
ducts. Unit costs and the components of the fuel cycle cost are listed
in Table 1.2.

1.5 Power Costs

The cost of power was obtained by combining fuel-cycle costs with
estimates of capital charges prepared by Sargent and Lundy, Engineers
(95,96), from a design study conducted at ORNL. Equipment was sized and
specified in sufficient detail that costs might be estimated by usual
procedures. Plant arrangement drawings were prepared from which costs of
buildings, piping, services, etc. were estimated. Operation and mainte-
nance costs were estimated according to standard procedures (52). A sum-

mary of the principal items is given in Table 1.3.

Miscellaneous charges 35,370,800
GRAND TOTAL $148,875,600
Net station power = 1038 Mwe

The fixed charges (14.46%) on the capital investment contribute 3.0
mills/kwhre to the power cost.
The uncertainty in this cost might run as high as 15-20%, and the
fixed charges might range up to 3:5 mills/kwhre.
Operation and maintenance contribute 0.3 mills/kwhre to the total
power cost (Table 1.4). Because of the many uncertainties, this estimate

may be low, and the cost might run as high as 0.5 mills/kwhre.

The various contributions to the cost of power have been summed in
Table 1.5.

Taking the upper bound on these three items estimated above (fuel
cost ~1.0, fixed charges ~3.5, operation and maintenance ~0.5) gives an

upper limit on the cost of power of 5.0 mills/kwhre.

 

1.6 Advanced MSCR

The system evaluated above was based on the scale-up of current tech-
nology, and was conservatively designed in every respect. There are sev-
eral obvious improvements that could be incorporated into a "second gen-.
| eration” design. If the design criteria were relaxed, metallic sodium
| could be substituted for the intermediate salt coolant (saving about $10

million in capital costs. This would also permit the use of "conventional"

once-through sodium-heated boilers and reduce the cost of the energy con-
version system by about another $10 million. The total cost would then be
~$125/kwe. By careful design and development the fuel volume might be re-
duced from 2500 ft to 1800 £t3. Separated 2Mo could be used to clad the
graphite and so reduce absorption of xenon therein and also as a struc-
tural material by means of which a blanket of ThF, bearing salt could be
added at the periphery of the core to reduce neutron leakage. The use of
Fluoride Volatility coupled with the HF Solution Process to remove rare
earths could reduce the fission product poisoning to very low levels while
permitting recycle of carrier salt (but not thorium). Preliminary calcu-
lations show that these improvements (all within reach of modest develop-
ment programs) might increase the conversion ratio above 1.0, and, with
the reduction in capital costs noted, result in a power cost of 3.4 mills/

kwhre.

2. INTRODUCTION
2.1 Purpose, Scope, and Method of Approach

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the economic potential of a
near-term molten salt power reactor. "Near-term" characterizes a system

which utilizes only techniques or equipment currently under development.

2.1.1 Figure of Merit

The economic potential of power reactors is measured by the net cost

“

of electric power.

Fuel cycle cost, although not definitive, is also an important index
of economic potential. Moreover, the optimization of the fuel cycle is a
required first step in the detailed design of both reactor and electric
plants. In this study, the reactor and its associated heat transfer sys-
tem, the energy conversion system, and the fuel reprocessing plant were

designed in detail sufficient to permit the optimization of the fuel cycle. i

2.1.2 Reactor Concept

A concept was selected for evaluation, which, judging from previous
experience, would satisfy the "near-term" requirement and yet would ex-
hibit attractive fuel costs: A single-fluid, single-region, graphite-
moderated molten-salt reactor generically related to the Molten Salt Re-

actor Experiment. Since the breeding ratio was expected to be less than =
unity, the system was designated the "Molten Salt Converter Reactor" = =u.
(MSCR). -

2.1.3 Procedure

In a series of preliminary calculations, the limitations on reactor
design imposed by consideration of allowable temperature, pressures, ve-
locities, thermal stress, etc., were determined. Design and cost bases
were established, and the fuel cycle cost was minimized by optimization
“of the key variables, which in the MSCR are the core diameter, carbon/

thorium ratio, volume fraction of fuel in the core, and spent fuel &

processing rate. For the optimum conditions, the fuel cycle costs result-
ing from alternate bases and assumptions (e.g., removal of xenon) were
determined. Finally, the ultimate performance resulting from a concatena-
tion of all favorable assumptions and potentially low processing costs

was estimated.

2.2 -Status of Molten Salt Reactor Development

2.2.1 Early Work

Molten salt fuels were conceived originally as a means of satisfying
the requirements for very high temperature and extremely high power density
necessary for aircraft propulsion. A very large amount of work on the
physical, chemical, and engineering characteristics of uranium and thorium
bearing molten fluorides was carried out as part of the ANP program at
Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

The technology of molten salt reactors was first introduced into the
open literature in 1957 by Briant and Weinberg (14). Papers by Bettis
et al. (6,7) and Ergen et al. (31) reported the Aircraft Reactor Experi-
ment, a beryllium-moderated reactor fueled with UF, dissolved in a mix-
ture of the fluorides of sodium and zirconium, and contained in Inconel.
The reactor was successfully operated in 1954 for about 90,000 kwhr with-
out incident at powers up to 2.5 Mwt and temperatures as high as 1650°F.

The potential usefulness of molten salt fuels for civilian power was
recognized from the start. The features that attracted attention were
the high temperature of the fuel (permitting use of modern steam technology
and attainment of high thermal efficiency) combined with a low vapor pres-
sure, the high stability of halide salts under radiation, end the advan-

tages that a fluid fuel provides. . These include a negative temperature

‘coefficient of reactivity, absence of the need for initial excess reac-

tivity and of neutron wastage in control elements, no limitation to fuel

exposure due to radiation damage or fuel burnup, the absence of a compli-
cated structure in the reactor core, removal of the heat transfer opera-
tion from the core to an external heat exchanger, and the potential for a

low-cost fuel cycle. In addition, suitable molten salt mixtures exhibit a

 
10

solubility for thorium fluoride sufficient for all reactor applications;
moreover, these mixtures may be economically and rapidly processed for
the recovery of 233y by means of the well-developed Fluoride Volatility
Process.

Studies of power reactors utilizing molten salts have been reported
by Wehmeyer (109), Jarvis (49), Davies (27), and Bulmer (15). Davidson
and Robb (26) conceived many of the features of one-region thorium con-

verter reactors and anticipated some of the development problems.

2.2.2 The Molten Salt Reactor Program

The molten salt reactor program was inaugurated at ORNL in 1956 (57,
58) to exploit the technology of molten salt fuels for purposes of economic

civilian power. Several parts of the program were: (a) a reactor evalua-

»

&

tion study to select the most promising concepts for civilian power and to
pinpoint specific development problems; (b) an extensive materials de-
velopment program for fuels, containers, and moderators; (ec) an equally
extensive program for the development of components, especially pumps,
valves, and flanges suitable for extended use with molten salts at 1300°F;
(4) a modest program for the discovery of supplementary chemical processes

for recovering valuable components (other than uranium) from spent fuel;

 

(e) a program for the development and definitive demonstration of the
feasibility of completely remote maintenance of molten salt reactor sys-
tems; and presently (f) the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE).

2.2.3 Fuel Development
The program for the development of molten salt fuels in the Reactor a -

Chemistry Division at ORNL has been highly successful (56). The five-com-

ponent mixtures (fluorides of Li, Be, Th, U, and Zr) developed for the

MSRE (12) have many exceptional features. They have melting points well

below 1000°F, with ample solubility for UF,, ThF,, and fission product
fluorides. They are thermodynamically stable with vapor pressures less

than 0.1 atm at temperatures well above 2000°F, and, being ionic liquids,

are not subject to permanent radiation demage (e.g., radiolytic dissocia-

tion) when in the liquid state. The parasitic capture cross sections of \&/

the base elements (7Li,.%Be, and 1°F) are satisfactorily low, and "Li

is available at attractive prices in grades containing as little as 0.005%
Li-6. The high volumetric heat capacities of salt mixtures make them
better heat transfer media than most liquid metals in spite of the higher
film conductances obtainable with the latter.

These mixtures do not appreciably attack the container material
(INOR-8), corrosion rates being less than 1 mil/year (possibly as low as
1/2 mil/year) at temperatures below 1300°F (28). Although it is not now
anticipated that it will be necessary to use INOR in the neutron active
zone, since the moderator material (graphite) is suitably self-supporting,
experiments have shown that the corrosion is not appreciably accelerated
by radiation. A long life (10-30 years) is predicted for all components
constructed of INOR (reactor vessel, pumps, heat exchangers, etc.) be-
cause resistance to corrosion does not depend on maintenance of a protec-
tive film but stems from the inertness of the base metal toward the salt.

Molten salt fuel mixtures are compatible with graphite. Tests of a
typical grade show that the salt does not wet the graphite and penetra-
tion is mostly confined to the surface layers (84, p. 93). Some CF, has
been observed in post-irradiation examination of in-pile experiments.
Since CF; is thermodynamically unstable with respect to the salt, it is
thought that its formation resulted from attack on graphite by free fluo-
rine produced by radiolysis of solid salt. Since the fuel-salt must be
maintained in the liquid state for other reasons, free fluorine would not
normally be present in the circulating stream.

Xenon is not adsorbed appreciably on graphite (17) at reactor tempera-
tures, though it will saturate the voids present because of its extremely
low solubility in salt (107). However, it may be possible to exclude Xe

from the graphite by treating the. surface to close the pores there and

render interior pores inaccessible (5). Purging the salt with a stream

of helium in the pump bowl or in a special contactor would then maintain

the Xe concentration at a very low level (Section 6.8). Iodine remains

in the ionic state and is not absorbed. Noble metal fission products are
expected to be reduced by INCR outside the core.

- The phase behavior of a great many mixtures has been investigated
(108). Proposed mixtures containing up to 40 mole % BeF, have viscosities

 
 

 

12

- adequately low and dissolve heavy metal fluorides (UF, ThF,, or ZrF,) in
concentrations up to 15 mole % with liquidus temperatures less than .1000°F
(56). Additions of 5 mole % of ZrF, to the base salt satisfactorily re-
duces the sensitivity of the fuel mixture toward precipitation of UO; by
oxygenated contaminants (e.g., air, water, lubricating oils) which will be
difficult to exclude entirely from a large reactor system. Graphite is
readily de-oxygenated by in situ decomposition of NH, F-EF vapor, which
shows negligible attack on the INOR.

Thermophysical properties of the important salt mixtures have been
measured (8,24) in detail sufficient to permit reliable calculation of
pumping and heat transfer characteristics, which are good. No evidence

of the deposition of scale or dendrites in the heat exchangers has been

i»

found.

. 2.2.4 Container Development

The development of nickel-molybdenum base alloys (INCR series) for
containment of molten fluorides was conducted jointly by ORNL and Inter-
national Nickel Company. In addition to the resistance to corrosion men-
tioned above, the alloys have good-to-excellent mechanical and thermal -
characteristics, (superior to those of many austenitic stainless steels)
and are virtually unaffected by long-term exposure to salts or to air at
1300°F (12). The alloy has been made by sevéral major manufacturing com-
panies, and it is presently available on a limited commercial basis in the
form of tubing, plates, bars, forgings, and castings. Exhaustive tests =
at ORNL have shown that its tensile properties, ductility, creep strength,
cyclic fatigue strength (both thermal and mechanical) are adequate for s
molten salt reactor applications when judged in accordance with criteria
used in the ASME Boiler Code (75-87). INCOR is weldable by conventional
techniques using welding rods of the same composition as the base metal.-
A gold-nickel alloy has been developed at ORNL suiteble for remote brazing
of reactor components. INCOR begins to soften above 2000°F and melts at
2500°F. The thermal conductivity is about 12 Btu/hr-ft-°F at 1200°F. No

major difficulties have been encountered in the design and fabrication of

©

reactor components, including pumps and heat exchangers (12).

2.2.5 Moderator Development

Graphite, because of its good moderating properties, low neutron cap-
ture cross section, compatibility with fluoride salts and INOR, and excel-
lent high-temperature physical properties is a superior moderator for
molten salt reactors. The graphite proposed for use in the MSRE has a
density of 1.8 g/cc and a kerosene-accessible porosity of 6%. About half
the pore volume is accessible from the surface. However, as mentioned
above, molten fluorides do not wet graphite and permeation of MSRE grade
graphite by the salt is less than. 0.5% by volume at 150 psi (84, p. 93).
The coefficient of permeability by helium at 30°C is 10° em? sec, and Xe
will be adsorbed rapidly. However, techniques for reducing permeability
are being developed. Samples of high-density graphite having permeabilis..
ties at least two orders of magnitude lower have been made (107).

Development of graphites and graphite bodies is being carried out
cooperatively with National Carbon Company. Pieces of graphite are pres-
ently available in sections up to 20 in. square and 20 ft long. Graphite
having outstanding mechanical properties is available in the form of
readily machinable rods, tubes, slabs, and spheres. The effects of nu-'..
clear radiations on this material are not fully known. The thermal con-
ductivity declines, but probably not below 15 Btu/hr° ft: °F. Thermal
stress considerations thus affect the design of moderator elements; the
allowable stress is thought to be at least 2000 psi and the allowable
strain at least 0.1%. These limits appear to be compatible with the
thermal and nuclear requirements of optimum core design. However, experi-
mental verification of these values is needed.

‘At the temperatures encountered in molten salt reactors, graphite
will shrink during exposure to fast neutrons. Where: large gradients in

the fast neutron flux exist, the resulting differential shrinkage will

result in deformations, or, if these are restrained, in stresses. The

problem of designing a long-lived core structure of large pieces of graph-
ite is presently unresolved. The bowing of graphite stringers might be

restrained by use of molybdenum hoops, but this solution may not be. suit-

able for large power reactors.

2.2.6 Component Development

Development of components for molten salt reactors has been in pro-
gress for over ten years. The most noteble achievements to date are.the
demonstration of the long-term reliability of pumps operating at 1300°F,
including pumps having molten-salt-lubricated bearings, and the demonstra-
tion of the reliability and maintainability of remotely operated freeze

flanges and freeze valves.

2.2.7 Reactor Vessel

No difficulties were encountered in the design or fabrication of the
reactor vessel for the MSRE. In large power reactors provision to limit
thermal stress by means of thermal shields may be necessary, but mechanical
Stresses are not important because pressures greater than 200 psi are not
encountered anywhere in the systems. Corrosion does not appear to be a

problem.

2.2.8 Molten Salt Pumps

Molten salt pumps have been operated continuously for 33 months at
temperatures above 1200°F. A sump-type pump having one salt-lubricated
journal bearing has logged more than 12,000 hours of operation at 1225°F,

1200 rpm, and 75 gpm. After it was stopped and restarted 82 times, examiz

nation of the bearings disclosed no discernible attack. The use of salt-
lubricated bearings will enable the shaft to be lengthened so that shield-
ing may be interposed between the pump bowl and the motor with its oil-
lubricated bearings. The impellers of these pumps also withstand attack
indefinitely under operating conditions. It is believed that pumps of
the types developed can be made in large sizes for use in large molten
salt reactor plants and that these can operate at the temperatures re-

quired.

2.2.9 Molten Salt Heat Exchangers and Steam Boilers ’

The design and fabrication of exchangers for transferring heat from

fuel salt to an intermediate coolant salt are straightforward. Heat

transfer experiments conducted at ORNL with unirradiated salt verify the
correlations used to predict the performance. Scale did not form on the
heat transfer surfaces.

The Loeffler boiler seems especially suited for use with molten salts.
Here dry saturated steam is superheated in a salt-to-steam exchanger; part
of the superheated steam is routed to the turbines, and part is recircu-
lated through an evaporator producing saturated steam for recycle to the
exchanger. - Problems in boiling burnout, thermal stress in the exchanger
tubes, and freezing of the salt are thus avoided.

However, a fuel-salt boiler presently in the conceptual stage has
many potential advantages. In this concept, the fuel downcomer annulus
inside the reactor vessel is widened tc accommodate several hundred INOR
thimbles. Bayonet tubes, into which water is introduced, are inserted
into the thimbles, but are separated from the thimble walls by a narrow
annulus filled with an inert salt. Calculations show that the heat trans-
fer is adequate to produce steam at 1000°F and 2000 psi. Yet the salt and
steam systems are isolated from direct contact and the salt system is .
under negligible pressure. Should either system leak, this would be de-
tected immediately by monitors in the inert salt system.

Such a boiler has many advantages, including the complete elimination
of one cooling loop and its associated pumps, heat exchanger, etc. In
addition, the fuel circuit is appreciably shortened in comparison to a
"spread-out" system. The steam produced will be considerably less radio-

active than that produced in a direct cycle boiling-water reactor.

2.2.10 Freeze Valves and Freeze Flanges

Although the high melting point of a molten salt reactor fuel (800—

1000°F) is. a disadventage in that the system must be preheated before

filling and provision must be made to avoid freezing, there are also bene-

fits that accrue. Among these is the fact that if a leak does occur there

© is little tendency for the material to disperse rapidly. Noble gas fis~

sion products do not accumulate in the liquid, and the fluorides of the

remaining fission products have negligible vapor pressure and are retained.

 
 

16

The ready solidification of salts has also been put to use in the
development of flanges and valves. The remote manipulation of reliable -
freeze flanges has been successfully demonstrated in many tests and in a
remote maintenance development facility. Freeze valves have no moving
parts, no seals, and have been demonstrated to be satisfactory inisalt .

transfer and drain: pipes.

2.2.11 Molten Salt Instrumentation and Special Equipment

Conventional equipment is adequate for measuring the nuclear behavior
of molten salt reactors; however, special equipment for handling molten
salts was developed at ORNL for the MSRE. For measuring liquid level in
the pump bowls, for example, a ball-float suspending an iron bob whose
position is sensed by an external induction coil was developed. A single
point electrical probe device has also been developed for use in the fill-
and-drain tanks to calibrate the weighing system.

A sampler-enricher device is being tested whereby fresh fuel may be
added to the fuel stream during operation, and e& sample of spent fuel may
be removed without contamination of the fuel stream by air or water vapor
and without the uncontrolled escape of any radioactive material from the
reactor.

Clam-shell electrical pipe heaters for lines carrying molten salt

have been developed.

2.2.12 Remote Maintenance

Because of fission-product contamination and induced activity in
components and piping, the fuel-containing portions of molten salt re-
actors cannot be approached for direct maintenance even after draining
and flushing. Semi-direct maintenance through a shield plug with long-
handled tools is possible for some items, but it is necessary to develop
completely remote tools and methods for many of the larger components.
These include tools, techniques, and procedures for removing and replacing
all major reactor components, including the heat exchanger, primary fuel-
pump and motor, reactor vessel, and fill-and-drain tank. Such equipment
and techniques successfully demonstrated in the Molten Salt Remote Main-
tenance Development Facility at ORNL (65). This facility simulated a

S

20-Mwt molten salt reactor system and comprised a mockup of the reactor
vessel, a mockup of the heat exchanger, together with full-scale pumps,
flanges, valves, electrical heaters, thermocouples, etc. All maintenance
operations were performed by a single operator from a remotely located
control center, using closed-circuit stereo-television for viewing. The
manipulator was a general purpose, medium duty, electro-mechanical "arm"
which performed a variety of functions easily and efficiently. It was
used to connect and disconnect tube and electrical connections, to carry
loads weighing up to 750 lbs and to manipulate tools. Eight basic mo-
tions, five for the arm and three for the crane bridge, were controlled
independently by two pistol-grip handles on the control console. Two
types of remotely interchangeable grasping devices permitted a variety
of objects to be handled.

Tools developed for remote manipulation included impact wrenches, a
torque tool and bolt runner, screw jacks on the heat exchanger for working
the freeze flanges, and miscellaneous devices such as lifting slings,
socket extensions, hooks, fingers, etc. All these were operated by the
menipulator. In addition, a reactor-lifting jig, a pump-lifting eye, and
socket extensions for the torque tool and bolt runner were positioned by
the manipulator, but operated by the crane or by their own power.

The installation of microphones at strategic locations inside the
reactor cell to enable the operator to listen to pneumatic and electric
motor sounds was found to be helpful.

Reliable, quickly acting disconnects for electric, pneumatic, oil, and
other services were adapted or developed.

The components of the Remote Maintenance Facility were removed and
replaced several times before the system was filled with salt in order to

develop procedures and test the tools. Finally, the system was filled

‘with salt, brought to temperature with salt circulating freely, then shut

down and drained. All equipment was then removed and replaced remotely,
and tested. The salt was replaced and brought to temperature again. Items
"maintained" in this way included the pump motor, the fuel pump, the re-
actor vessel, the heat exchanger, the fill-and-drain tank, electrical pipe

heaters, and thermocouples. The demonstration was entirely successful.

 
 

 

18

Maintenance of the MSRE will be accomplished by means of the tech-
niques and tools developed and supplemented with some semi-direct main-
tenance operations through a portable shield having a rotatable plug.
Long-handled tools may be inserted through this plug and manipulated by
hand. These means of maintenance will be thoroughly tested in a full-

scale mockup of the MSRE now being constructed at ORNL.

2.2.13 Chemical Processing of Molten Salt Fuels

The use of fluid fuels in nuclear reactors provides an opportunity
for continuously removing fission products and replacing fissile isotopes
at power. Thus, it is possible to hold fission-product neutron losses to
low levels and to eliminate capture of neutrons in control rods.

The "Fluoride Volatility Process" is in an advanced stage of develop-
ment; a pilot plant for general application is now in operation at ORNL.
Other processes are being sought, and prospects. are good that simple and
economic means can be found to separate fission products continuously

from spent fuel salt.

2.2.14 Fluoride Volatility and HF Solution Processes

While the fluoride volatility process was not developed specifically
for use with molten salt fuels, it has been verified in laboratory experi-
ments conducted at ORNL that it is applicable for removal of uranium from
fluoride mixtures containing ThF; (16). In this process, elemental fluo-
rine, diluted with an inert gas, is bubbled through the salt. UF; is
converted to UFg which is volatile at the temperature of operation (500
700°C) and passes out of the contactor to be absorbed reversibly in a bed
of sodium fluoride. The off-gas is cooled, stripped of F. in a ‘scrubber,
and passed through charcoal beds where fission product gases are absorbed.

The fluorides of a few of the fission products are also volatile but
these are irreversibly absorbed in the sodium fluoride beds. - Thus, by.
heating the beds, UFg is brought over in a very pure state, completely
decontaminated and with losses less than 0.1%.

The UF¢ is reduced to UF, in a hydrogen-fluorine flame, and is col-

lected as a powder in a cyclone separator backed up by gas filters. Losses

routinely are smaller than random errors in the assays, and the process
has been used successfully for many years in the manufacture of enriched
2357 from natural uranium in the production plants at Oak Ridge.

The Fluoride Volatility Process alone is sufficient for the economi-
cal operation of a molten salt converter reactor. Spent fuel containing
UF, , ThF,, 233pa, as well as fission products is removed from the reactor
periodically and fluorinated for recovery of uranium isotopes. The :
stripped salt is discarded (stored in INOR cylinders indefinitely) to
purge the system of fission products. Although the discarded salt con-
tains valuable components (7Li, Be, 232Th, 223Pa), the cost of discarding
these is offset by the improvemént in conversion watidw. io.

The steps described above appear to be especially attractive for
integration with the reactor plant. That is, they are all high-tempera-
ture, non-aqueous processes, and could conveniently be carried out in the
reactor cell, utilizing the same shielding and sharing in the use of re-
mote maintenance equipment. The waste product (fuel salt stripped of
itotopes of uranium) is in a form conveniently stored for decay of radio-
activity. After a period measured in years, the waste could conveniently
be removed to another location for recovery of thorium, lithium, beryl-
lium, and other valuable components in a relatively low-level-radiation
facility.

The HF Solution Process (16) under study at ORNL provides one means
of separating rare earths (which constitute the bulk of important non-
volatile fission products, including isotopes of samarium) from the base
salt, after uranium has been removed. The separation is effected by dis=-

solving solidified salt in liquid HF containing up to 10% water. The

‘rare earths, thorium, and related materials precipitate and may be sepa-

rated by filtration or decantation, permitting reuse of the salt. The
HF Solution Process is presently in the laboratory stage of development.

2.2.15 Thorex: Process

While the Fluoride Volatility process appears attractive if inte-
grated with the reactor plant, it is not obvious that it is superior in

a central facility to alternative modes of processing, such as Thorex.

 
 

20

This uncertainty is due in part to paucity of reliable information on
costs of on-site and central Fluoride Volatility process plants, and in
part to the limitations of the method in respect to recovery of lithium
and thorium. On the other hand, the costs of Thorex plants are rather
better known, and, with suitable modifications, Thorex appears to permit
economic recovery of all valuable components of the fuel salt only mod-
erately contaminated with certain fission products (e.g., cesium). The .
costs associated with a modified Thorex process as described in Section

5.3 were used in an alternate evaluation of the MSCR.

2.2.16 Fractional Crystallization Process

Studies by Ward et al. (108; :106, 80,.p. 80) provide a basis for
evaluating the feasibility of removing rare earth fluorides from the fuel
salt by partial freezing. A brief description is given in Section 6.7.3.
The process is not suitable for a breeder reactor inasmuch as the fission
product concentration cannot be lowered much below 0.2 mole %; however,
much higher concentrations can be tolerated in a converter. In the ref-

erence design studied here, the concentration is approximately 0.5 mole %.

2.2.17 Other Processes

Solvents which will selectively dissolve either ThF, or rare earth
fluorides are being sought at ORNL. Solutions of SbFs in HF show some
promise.

The capture of a neutron by an atom of 233Pa results in a double
loss — that of the neutron and of the fissile atom of 233U that would
have been formed by decay of the Pa. A process is needed that can quickly
and economically remove 233Pa from the circulating salt stream so that it
may be held outside the reactor until it decays to 233U. There is a pos-
sibility that exposing the fertile stream to beds of ThO, pellets might.
accomplish this. There is some evidence that thorium from the beds will
exchange with Pa in the solution, and the latter will be immobilized until
it decays, after which it might, as 233U, exchange with thorium in the
salt, and so become available for recovery by fluorination. Other oxides,

e.g., BeO, are also under study.

2.2.18 Molten Salt Reactor Studies

The status of the Molten Salt Reactor Program was reviewed in 1958
for the second Geneva Conference by MacPherson et al. (56). At that
time a homogeneous molten salt reactor having only a limited capability
for fuel regeneration was under consideration. Further studies of this
system were reported by Alexander et al. (1), and a 30-Mwt experimental
reactor was described (2).

Also, in 1958, good indications were obtained that the system INOR-
graphite-salt is chemically stable in radiation fields and attention was
accordingly shifted to graphite-moderated systems. MacPherson et al.
(60) described a one-region single-fluid reactor utilizing slightly en-
riched uranium and a highly enriched feed. Many features of his concept
were incorporated in the present study.

The potential of graphite-moderated molten-salt reactors for breeding
in the Th-233U cycle was investigated and the associated development
problems were identified by MacPherson in a series of papers (61-63).
Several conceptual designs for one- and two-region breeders were proposed.
One of these (the MSBR) was evaluated in comparison with four other ther-
mal breeders by the Thorium Breeder Reactor Evaluation Group at ORNL (3);
this system employed a fuel salt (contained in graphite bayonet tubes and
circulated through external heat exchangers) together with a fertile salt
stream (containing all the thorium) surrounding the moderated core region.
The major problems associated with this concept were the development of a
reliable graphite-metal joint for connecting the bayonet tubes to an INCOR
header and the uncertain behavior of the core structure for long periods
under irradiation at high power densities.

It was estimated that the MSBR could achieve fuel yields up to about
7%/year (doubling time about 14 years) at fuel cycle costs not greater
then 1.5 mills/kwhr; and that fuel costs as low as 0.7 mills/kwhr could
be achieved by sacrificing the fuel yield in favor of lower processing
costs (3).

2.3 Molten Salt Reactor Experiment

The favorable results obtained in the various evaluation and develop-
ment programs led to the initiation in May 1960 of preliminary design of
“the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (12,5). Construction and installation
of the entire system are scheduled for completion in mid-1964 and criti-

cality late in 1964, or early 1965.

The MSRE is expected to demonstrate the long-term reliability of
components and the compatibility of materials under actual operating con-
ditions, including the dimensional stability of the graphite and its re-
sistance to permeation by fuel salt in the presence of radiations and the
maintainability of the system after operation at power.

The reactor will produce up to 10 megawatts of heat in a fuel con-
sisting of a solution of highly enriched 235U'F, dissolved in a mixture
of the fluorides of lithium (99.990% 71i), beryllium, and zirconium
having a liquidus temperature of 842°F. The salt enters a volute around
the upper part of the cylindrical vessel at 1175°F and flows at the rate
of 1200 gpm down through an annular plenum between the wall of the vessel
and up the graphite core-matrix. This is constructed by pinning 2-ini::
square bars loosely to INOR beams lying across the bottom of the vessel.
The salt flows up among the bars at a velocity of 0.7 ft/sec. (Reynolds
number 1000) and exits at 1225°F.

The fuel pump, a sump-type having a bowl 36-in. in diameter and
12 in. high, is driven by a 75 hp motor and develops: a head of 48.5 ft
at 1200 gpm. All parts are constructed of INOR.

The heat exchanger, also constructed of INOR, has 165 tubes 14 ft
long by 1/2 in. OD with walls 0.042 in. thick, and provides 259 £t? of
heat transfer surface (heat flux 130,000 Btu/hr-£t° at a IMTD of 133°F).
The reactor heat is transferred to a secondary salt coolant from whence
it is discharged to the atmosphere in an air-cooled radiator.

Initially, the MSRE will contain no thorium, since the power level
is too low for significant amounts of 233U to be produced in a reasonable
time. Thorium may be added later to permit verification of nuclear calcu- ~~

lations of critical mass, etc., and to discover if there are any unfore- \o

seen compatibility or stability problems.

3. BASES AND ASSUMPTIONS

3.1 Design Bases

3.1.1 Reactor Concept

The concept selected for study was mqdeled closely after that pro-
posed by MacPherson et al. (60), and is essentially a scaletup of the ..
Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (12,5) plud necessary auxiliary equipment
for generation of electricity, etc. Briefly, the core consists of a ver-
tical bundle of unclad graphite logs contained in an INOR vessel. Fuel
salt containing thorium and uranium flows up through the bundle into a
plenum, thence through several pumps in parallel to the shell side of
multiple shell-and-tube heat exchangers, and then back to the reactor.

3.1.2 Design Calculations

These were performed only in sufficient detail to permit the estima-
tion of the capital cost. Problems of control, shielding, hazards analy-
sis, etc., were ignored. . Attention was centered on the nuclear perform-
ance and processing costs. The energy conversion system was designed to
provide a basis for estimating the volume of the fuel salt circulating
in the primary heat system, the net thermal efficiency, and the capital

investment.

3.1.3 Station Power

An electrical capability of 1000 Mw was selected to permit direct
comparison with systems previously evaluated at the same plant capacity.
Preliminary calculations indicated that the core should be ~20 ft in diam
eter for satisfactory nuclear performance. At a power of 1000 Mwe, power
densities are only 14 kw/liter of core and 35 kw/liter of salt (average).
A lower plant output would result in inefficient utilization of the fuel

inventory. -

 
 

 

24

3.1.4 Plant Utilization Factor

The standard factor of 0.8 was used as recommended in the "Guide"
(52).

3.1.5 Thermal Efficiency

Several different energy conversion schemes were considered in suf-
ficient detail (see. Section 4.3) to show that even the least efficient
system (Loeffler boiler) would have, when fully optimized, a thermal ef-
ficiency not less than 40%. This efficiency was therefore adopted for

use in the fuel cost optimization calculations.

3.1.6 Fueling Cycle

For the purposes of optimization calculations, it was assumed that
make-up fuel was added and spent fuel was removed quasi-continuously,
and that, with three exceptions, the concentrations of the various nu-
clides in the circulating salt system were in equilibrium with respect
to feed rates, nuclear reactions, and processing rates. The exceptions
were 234y and 238y (which are initially present in amounts substantially
lower than the equilibrium value, and whose concentrations increase with
time) and 236U (the concentration of which starts at zero and reaches
only about 3/4 of its equilibrium values in 30 years). For these three
isotopes, concentrations that approximated the average over a life of
30 years starting with the reactor charged with 23°U (95% enrichment)
were used. Other important isotopes appear to approach their equilibrium
concentrations in times short compared to the reactor life. The use of
equilibrium concentrations for these, especially for slowly equilibrating

fission products, is discussed in Appendix H.

3.1.7 Processing

The processing rate was optimized with respect to the fuel cycle
cost. In the selected process, spent fuel is accumulated, shipped to a
central Fluoride Volatility Plant, cooled for a minimum of 90 days, and
treated for recovery of uranium. Undecayed 233pg, along with 232, Li,

and Be are lost in the waste.

3.1.8 Feed and Recycle

In the optimization calculations, it was assumed that isotopes of
uranium recovered from irradiated fuel are recycled, and that deficiencies
in the breeding ratio are compensated by additions of 95%-enriched 235y.

The effects of a few feed and recycle schemes on the optimum reactor
were studied (Section 6.9), such as the use of feeds containing a mixture
of uranium isotopes (e.g., spent fuel from the Consolidated Edison Reactor
at Indian Point, New York). The sale of irradiated fuel to the AEC as an

alternate to recycle was also investigated.

3.1.9 Isotopic Composition of Lithium

It was assumed that lithium (as the hydroxide) would be available in
grades containing up to 99.995% 7Li at a price no greater than that quoted
in reference 67 ($120/kg of lithium). The choice of this composition
(rather than one having a lower cost) resulted from a compromise between
cost of neutron losses to ®Li and the cost of discarding the salt enriched

in Li with a processing rate of about 2 £t3/day.

3.1.10 Energy Conversion System

Although it would be difficult to establish a complete set of require-
ments for coupling of the reactor system with the energy conversion system
prior to the preparation of a detailed design; nevertheless, it is neces-
sary to fix some of these in order that the fuel cycle cost may be esti-
mated. The most important requirement appears to be a necessity to iso-
late the fuel salt from the thermodynamic fluid, at least when that fluid
is water. The hazards associated with the possibility that high pressure
steam might leak into the fuel system cannot be tolerated, since such ..
leakage would result in the rapid formation of UO, (81, p. 63). This is
only slightly soluble in the base salt, although its solubility can be
increased. somewhat by additions of ZrF,; and of ThF, (84, p- 96). Isola-
tion of the steam and fuel systems is achieved by interposing a compatible
third fluid, either as a stagnant layer or as a separate stream circulated

between primary and secondary heat exchangers.

 
 

 

26

The intermediate coolant (third fluid) must be chemically compatible
with fuel salt, and in'addition, it is desirable that it be inert with
respect to steam. - Also, it should either not be a nuclear poison, or
else it should be readily removable from fuel salt. . For the reference
design, a salt 66 mole % LiF (99.995% 7Li) and 34 mole % BeF, was selected
(Table 3.4) as the intermediate fluid.

3.1.11 Primary Heat Exchanger Requirements

It is important that the external portion of the fuel salt circulat-
ing system shall have as small a volume as possible in order to reduce
the inventory of valuable materials. However, the reliability and main-
tainability of the system cannot be compromised in favor of small volume.
A requirement for maintainability, which includes replaceability, implies
that the primary heat exchanger shall be drainable of fuel salt. This re-
quirement is most easily and certainly met by putting the fuel salt in
the shell:sides of the heat exchangers and grouping these about the reac-
tor in a vertical position so that the heads may be removed and the tube
bundles lifted out easily.

3.1.12 Minimum Salt Temperatures

To provide a margin of safety in regard to possible freezing of both
fuel salt and intermediate coolant salt, it was decided that the operating
temperature of any salt stream should not be at a temperature less than
the liquidus temperature of the fuel salt.

3.2 Cost Bases

3.2.1 Value of Fissile Isotopes

 

Unirradiated, highly enriched 23°U was valued at $12.01/gram of con-
tained 23°U (52). Mixtures of isotopes were valued according to the
formula V = £(E) $12/gram of contained fissile isotope (?33U, 23°U), where
f(E) is an enrichment factor found by dividing the value of enriched 235y
having the same composition as the mixture in question by $12.01/gram.

The enrichment, E, of the mixture is found by dividing the sum of the

O

it

27

atomic concentrations of 225U and 232U (and 233Pa, if any) by the sum of
atomic concentrations of all isotopes of uranium in the mixture (thus
lumping 234U and 236U with 238U as diluents).

3.2.2 Value of Thorium

Inquiries directed to several vendors elicited only one reply (Appen-
dix J); however, the quotation given ($6/1b of ThF,) agreed well with a
1959 estimate by Orrosion (89) and led to the adoption of a price of
$19.00/kg of thorium as ThF; ($6.50/1b ThF,).

 

3.2.3 Value of LiF(99.995% Li)"

This was taken to be $120/kg of contained lithium (Appendix J) or
$32.30/kg of LiF.

3.2.4 Value of BeFp

Inquiries cited in Appendix J led to adoption of a price of $15.40/kg
of BeF, .

3.2.5 Value of Base Salt

This varied with the composition, but the base salt in the optimum
reactor contained 68 moles of LiF per 23 moles of BeF, giving a value of
$25.97/kg.

3.2.6 Cost of Compounding and Purifying Fuel Salt

The operation of blending recycle uranium with make-up uranium and
fresh lithium, beryllium, and thorium fluoride and purifying is to be per-
formed on-site. The cost was therefore excluded from the operating and

~ capital charges of the processing plent and included in the capital and

operating charges of the reactor plant.

The following cost information supplied by A. Taboads of ORNL is
based on quantity production. Manufacturing experience to date with fab-

rication of the listed forms has not indicated the existence of any

 
 

 

28

serious problems and therefore pricing safety factors in the costs shown

may be pessimistic.

Plate $3 per 1b

Round Rod © $4.25 per 1b

Welding Rod - $8 per 1b

Pipe (Seamless) ~ $10 per 1b

Fabricated Plate $10 per 1b (e.g., pressure vessel shells)
Dished Heads $5.50 per 1b
Forged Pipe Fittings $50 per 1b

Castings $2 per 1b

3.2.8 Moderator Graphite Cost

The cost of graphite such as would be used in the MSCR core has been
established at $6.00 per 1b. This is from informal discussion with ven-

dors.

3.2.9 Annual Fixed Charges

For fissile isotopes, the use charge was taken at 4.75%/yr in ac-
cordance with the "Guide" (52). Other components of the fuel mixture were
carried as depreciating assets (since only the isotopes of uranium and
thorium are recoverable). For such the "Guide" recommends (Table 3.1) an
annual rate of 14.46% for an investor-owned public utility (IOPU). This
rate, however, includes 0.35% for interim replacement when the rate of re-
Placement is not known. In the present instance, the replacement rates
for base salt were calculated and the corresponding costs listed sepa-
rately; therefore, the annual charge for the above items was set at ... ..
14.11% /yr. This included also 1.11% /yr for amortization by means of a
30-yr sinking fund with cost of money at 6.75%/yr; hence, a charge for
replacement of salt at the end of 30 years was not made either separately

or as part of the final processing to recover the uranium inventory.

3.2.10 Central Fluoride Volatility Plant Processing Charges

The schedule given below was extracted from the estimates presented
in Table 5.9 and apply to a plant capable of processing 30 ft3 of salt
per day (about 1000/kg day of thorium for the reference design salt) for
recovery of isotopes of uranium. The barren salt is discarded. Capital
investment ($25.5 million) was estimated by scaling from a study by
Carter, Milford, and Stockdale (21) of two smaller on-site plants (1.2
and 12 £t3/day), and adding costs of other facilities required in a cen-
tral plant (receiving, outside utilities, land improvements, etc.). The
plant is large enough to service about fifteen 1000 Mwe molten salt con-
verter reactor plants. A turn-around-time of two days was allowed. Ship-

ping charges ($10.30/kg thorium) were estimated separately (Table 5.8).

3.3 Special Assumptions

"3.3.1 Permeation of Graphite by Salt

Tests with MSRE fuel salt at 1300°F and 150 psi in MSRE graphite
showed penetrations of the order of 0.02% in 100 hours (86, p. 93). Most

"of the absorbed salt was contained in pockets lying at the surface of the

graphite, and presumably in communication with bulk liquid. From a metal-

lographic examination of thin sections, it was concluded that penetrations

 
 

 

30

QO

considerably less than 0.12% would be encountered in the MSRE at the .
maximum pressure of 65 psia. For the purposes of evaluating the MSCR,
it was assumed the penetration would be 0.14, and that only pores lying
at the surface would contain salt. Thus, in a core 90 volume % graphite
the volume of salt absorbed in the graphite would be slightly less than
1% of the volume of salt in the core. This absorbed salt was assumed

to have the same composition as the circulating stream.

3.3.2 Permeation of Graphite by 37 Xenon.

The solubility of xenon and other noble fission product gases in fuel
salt is very low (107); also, their adsorption on graphite at 1200°F ap- .
pears to be negligible (17). However, there remains the possibility that
gaseous xenon may diffuse into the pores in graphite at a rate large com~ =
pared to that at which it can be removed from the salt by sparging or
spraying. The mathematical treatment of the case at hand has been pre-
sented by Watson, et. al. (107), who also established probable ranges
for the diffusion coefficient. For the purposes of a reference calcula-
tion having a reasonable degree of plausibility, a value of 107% (cm?/
sec) was selected for the diffusion coefficient and a value of 0.01 for
the porosity of graphite to noble gases. Further, it was assumed. to be
feasible to by-pass 10% of the fuel salt (16 ft3/sec) through the pump
bowls or through a sparge chamber, and that this by-pass steam would give

up substantially all of its xenon to the sweep gas.

"3.3.3 Corrosion Products

Tests in a forced convection INCOR loop using a salt (62-LiF, 36.5- oo:
BeFp, 0.5-UF,, 1.0-ThF,) very similar (except for thorium content) to
that proposed for the MSCR, show that after a period of initial attack
(occurring generally in the equipment in which the batch of salt is pre-
pared) the concentration of structural-element cations reaches equilibrium
values (84, p. 79). The temperature of the salt was 1300°F in the hot
leg, 1100°F in the cold leg, and was circulated for a total of almost
15,000 hours. - The concentration of nickel, after rising to a maximum of

80 ppm in about a thousand hours, reached an equilibrium value of about o'

in

31

50 ppm at 2000 hours. Chromium concentration fluctuated between 400 and
600 ppm, averaging about 500 ppm, while iron averaged about 250 ppm.
Molybdenum was said to be negligible and was not reported.

Apparently the concentration of chromium is in equilibrium with
respect to the rate with which chromium is oxidized by UF; to CrF2 at the
hot metal surfaces and the rate with which it is reduced to Ocr at the
cold surfaces (75, p. 39). In the MSCR, large areas of INOR are exposed
to the salt at all temperatures between 1100°F and 1300°F. Although the
rate of diffusion of chromium’ in INOR has been determined at various
teriperatures, it is not possible to calculate the chromium concentration
in the salt until the temperature profile is known.

In the calculations performed here, a neutron-poison allowance was
made for corrosion products, amounting to 0.008 neutrons per atom of
fuel destroyed. This loss is comparable to the loss that would result
if the concentrations of Ni, Cr, and Fe were 50, 500, and 250 ppm, as in

the loop-corrosion test cited above (Section 6.3).

3.3.4 Approach to Equilibrium

The nuclear performance was calculated by means of MERC-1l, an equi-"-
librium reactor code. Thus the performance of the reactor during the
approach to equilibrium, when concentrations of isotopes of uranium and
of fission products are changing, was not considered, except in regard to
234y, 236y, and 238U. These were averaged over a fuel lifetime of 30
years; 233U, 235U, and fission products were taken at their equilibrium
values.

In cases where adequate supplies of 233U are unavailable the reactor
would be fueled initially with enriched 225U. This is inferior to ?33U

in respect to eta and also forms a non-fertile daughter , 236u. These

disadvantages are offset by initially-low concentrations of fission
products and ?26U. While a calculation of the time-dependent behavior is
desirable in such cases, it does not appear that the error introduced by
assuming equilibrium conditions is important. The matter is explored
further in Appendix H.

4. DESCRIPTION OF MSCR CONCEPT

4.1 General Description

The MSCR is a single-region, unreflected, graphite-moderated fluid-
fuel reactor utilizing a mixture of molten fluorides of lithium, beryl-
lium, thorium, and uranium as the fuel and primary coolant. A sketch of -
the reference design reactor is shown in Fig. 4.1. As seen in this fig-
ure, the reactor consists of a 20-ft-diam by 20-ft-high cylindrical core
made up of 8-in.-diam graphite cylinders. The fuel salt enters through
a bottom grid, flows upward through the spaces between the cylinders and
is discharged into one of eight primary heat removal circuits located
around the reactor. The arrangement of these circuits is shown in Fig.
4.2. The heat generated in fuel salt is transferred to an intermediate
coolant salt consisting of a mixture of barren lithium and beryllium
fluoride containing no uranium or thorium. The coolant salt is used to
superheat saturated steam produced in a Loeffler boiler and also to re-
heat steam from the turbogenerators. The reactor vessel, internals and
all primary and secondary system components in contact with fuel salt and
coolant salt are constructed of INOR-8. The specifications are tabulated
in section 4.10. Part of the superheated steam is sent to a high-pressure
turbine and the rest is injected into the Loeffler boilers to generate
saturated steam. This saturated steam is recirculated to the superheater
by steam-driven axial compressors using steam drawn from the high-pressure
turbine discharge. A flowsheet of this heat removal-power generation sys-
tem is shown in Fig. 4.3.

. Design data and operating characteristics for the reference design

are given in Table 4.1.
4.2 Site Plant

The site plan of the MSCR plant is shown in Fig. 4.4 based on con-
ditions specified in the AEC Cost Evaluation Guide (52). The 1200-acre
grass-covered site has level terrain and is located on the bank of a

river. Grade level of the site is 40 ft above the river low water level

for the ultimate station capacity is assumed to be provided by the river
with an average maximum temperature of 75°F and an average minimum tem-

perature of 40°F.

4.3 Structures

Plan views of the reactor and turbine building are shown in Figs. 4.5

and 4.6 and vertical sections in Fig. 4.7. As seen in these figures, the
reactor building and turbine building are adjacent, the secondary shield
wall forming a separation from grade to the main floor. The buildings
are two-level structures with the grade floors of the turbine and reactor
buildings at an elevation of one foot above grade, and the main floor at
36 feet above grade. The secondary shield wall extends to the main floor
and forms the walls of the lower part of the reactor and auxiliary build-
ing.

The turbine building and the upper level of the reactor and auxiliary
buildings are steel frame structures, with insulated metal panel siding.
The arrangement of the equipment within the buildings is indicated on the
general arrangement drawings, Figs. 4.5 and 4.7.

A three-level steel frame and insulated metal-panel structure ad-

_ joining the turbine building houses the administrative offices, control
room, switchgear, batteries, plant heating boiler and makeup water de-
mineralization plant. Lockers, showers, and toilets for plant personnel
are also located in this building.

A 200-ft waste gas stack is provided for dispersal of plant venti-
lating air and waste gases from the various reactor and reactor equipment

rooms.

4.4 Primary System Components

The primary system components consist of the reactor vessel, modera-
tor, fuel salt pumps and fuel salt-to-intermediate coolant salt heat ex-
changer. The arrangement of these components is shown in Figs. 4.1 and
4.2. Design and performance characteristics are summarized in the follow-

ing paragraphs.

4.4.1 Reactor Vessel

The reactor vessel is 20 ft in diameter and 37 ft high (including
expansion dome) as shown in Fig. 4.1. The vessel wall is fabricated of
2-in.-thick INOR-8. No thermal shield is required since the gamma heat-
ing of the vessel wall does not exceed 0.6 w/ce. The thickness of the
external vessel insulation and salt flow through the core-vessel annulus
can be adjusted as necessary to avoid excessive thermal stresses in the
vessel wall and at the same time minimize heat loss to the external con-
tainment space.

A 6-ft diam expansion dome at the top of the reactor vessel not only
provides surge volume but serves as the fuel salt volatiles purge loca-
tion, the UF, pellet injection point and salt sampler location. Circula-
tion of fuel salt in the dome is accomplished by recirculation of salt
from each pump discharge through an orificed 2-in. line to a point below
the normal liquid level in the dome. This level is maintained by adjust-
ing the pressure of the helium cover gas. To minimize holdup of salt,
50% of the volume of the dome is occupied by 2-in. diam sealed INOR-8
tubes.

The reactor vessel is provided with eight inlet nozzles which dis-
charge fuel salt radially into the bottom plenum, eight outlet nozzles
leading to the pumps, together with bottom and top INOR-8 grids for sup-
port and restraint of the graphite core. These grids in turn are sup-
ported by columns or stanchions attached to the reactor vessel.

The reactor vessel specifications are given in Section 4.10.

4.4.2 Moderator Structure:

The graphite matrix is composed of cylindrical logs 8.in. in diameter
and 24 in. long, as shown in Fig. 4.8. These are stacked in a vertical
position and alligned by means of axial pins and sockets. Fuel-salt flows
up through the cusp-shaped passages between logs.

The "pile" is centered in the vessel by metal pins protruding from
the support plates at the bottom and top of the vessel. These are located
near the axis of the vessel and mate with a corresponding moderator log.
Initially the pile rests on the lower support grid; as the reactor is
filled with salt, the pile floats up against the upper grid. The pins,
while allowing this vertical motion, keep the central logs centered in
the vessel. The remaining logs are bound to these by means of metal hoops
passing around the peripheral logs. These hoops are fabricated from mo-
lybdenum, which has about the same coefficient of expansium as graphite.
This arrangement allows the support grids to expand independently of the
moderator as the reactor is brought to operating temperature. Also, the
increase in height of the vessel on expansion 1s accommodated.

The radial profile of temperature in the fuel-salt is flattened by
proper distribution of the flow, which is accomplished by orificing the
flow channels. The bottom row of moderator logs is machined from hexa-
gonal pieces. A 4-in. section of the end in contact with the support
grid is not machined. If close-packed in a triangular lattice, these ends
would block completely the flow path of the fuel salt. Therefore, the
corners of the hexagons are cut away to provide orifices of appropriate

diameter for each channel.

4.4.3 Fuel-Salt Circulating Pumps

Circulation of the fuel salt flowing at 9075 gpm is maintained by a
centrifugal pump as shown in Fig. 4.9 in each of the eight independent
heat exchange circuits. Because the system has no valves or other means
of equipment isolation, the pumps are installed at the highest elevation
(and the highest temperature region) of the circuit between the reactor
and the primary heat exchanger. By this means it is possible to avoid

the hazard of seal flooding and reverse rotation at standstill and to

minimize some design problems related to thermal expansion, shaft seal
and guide bearings, and maintenance accessibility. Locating the pumps sO
close to the reactor, however, introduces the problem that the organic
materials used in the motor winding insulation and bearing lubricant must
be shielded from radiation. Also the pump motor and oil-lubricated bear-
ings must be located at some distance from the salt region. In the design
shown, the motor and oil-bearings are positioned above the pumps for easy
maintenance and a lower salt lubricated bearing providéd to take the
radial thrust. Circulation of salt through this bearing is accomplished
by allowing salt to leak upwards around the shaft and out a small vent
line. A cylindrical casing above the impeller provides expansion volume
and a volatile fission product purging surface. The surface of salt in
this casing is maintained at the same level as that in the expansion dome
under a helium cover gas at 22 psi. This gas overpressure also helps
prevent impeller cavitation.

Detailed specifications of the MSCR pumps are given in Section 4.10.

4.4.4 Primary Heat Exchanger

The design of the heat exchanger for transferring heat from the fuel
salt to the intermediate coolant salt is shown in Fig. 4.10. This shell
and tube heat exchanger is of a U tube configuration designed particularly
for accessibility to the tube sheet from above without disturbing con-
necting piping. Removal of the tube bundle through the top head is also
possible with the given design. With. this configuration, however, the
more valuable fuel salt, which normally would be circulated through the
tubes, is put on the shell side to permit ready drainage. The tube bundle
and associated baffles, which can slide into the shell from above, hang
from the tube-sheet which rests on a shelf machinéd into the shell. A
circumferential seal weld joins the tube sheet to the shell and separates
the coolant from the fuel salt. A hobld-down ring keeps the tube sheet in
place in case pressure on the shell side should exceed pressure on the
tube side. Normal design conditions require that the coolant salt (tube
side) be kept at a pressure higher than that of the fuel salt.

The end-closure may be sealed against leakage of coolant salt to the
outside in several ways. A bearing and sealing surface (much like a
valve seat) is provided at point "A" shown on Fig. 4.10. A frozen salt
seal is maintained in the annulus above "A". A seal weld could be made
at the top between the flange on the shell side and the inverted head.

Or lastly, double-gaskets on circles inside and outside of the seal weld
lip could confine leakage if the seal weld, or other seals ahead of the
seal weld, should fail. A massive hold-down flange bolted to the top
flange provides the strength necessary to hold the inverted head against
the several hundred pound pressure of the coolant salt.

A partition attached to the inverted heat fits closely into a dia-
metrical slot in the tube sheet to separate the inlet coolant salt plenum
from the outlet plenum. A small amount of by-pass flow may occur through .
the very small gap between the slot and the partition. The inverted head
is shaped so as to minimize the volume of coolant salt in the tube-sheet
distribution plenums. The inlet and outlet coolant nozzles are noncircu-
lar in cross section (flattened and broadened so as to minimize head-space
without sacrificing flow area).

Not shown are cooling and heating provisions for the top head, heat-
ing provisions for the shell or the insulation which must be provided.

In order to avoid excsssive thermal stresses in the tube sheet it may
be necessary to reduce the thermal gradient across the tube sheet by pro-
viding insulation between it and the fuel salt.

An appreciable heel of coolant salt will remain in the tubes after
draining. In order that the salt-containing internals of the heat ex-
changer be exposed only to inert atmospheres when the top closure is re-
moved, the upper portion of the heat exchanger (above the coolant nozzle)
is provided with a gas-tight caisson that extends from the heat exchanger
to the locality of the maintenance equipment.

The specifications given in Section 4.10 are based on eight heat ex-
changers per reactor, each with a heat load of 1.006 x 10° Btu/hr per unit.

4.5 Intermediate Cooling System

4.5.1 Introduction

Leakage of steam into the fuel salt would result in precipitation of
uranium; therefore, a material which has good heat transfer properties and
is compatible with both fuel salt and steam must be interposed between
these two materials. Of the various possible choices, a barren salt of
LiF-BeF, appears to be the most promising and is used as a basis for the
present MSCR design involving a Loeffler steam generation system. In this
design the intermediate cooling system consists of the heat exchanger al-
ready described, coolant salt pumps, steam superheaters and steam reheat-

ers.

4.5.2 Coolant Salt Pumps

The coolant salt pumps are similar in design to the fuel salt pumps
but have a higher capacity and head. Eight pumps serve the sixteen super-
heaters and four reheaters and each pump circulates 13,900 gpm of coolant
salt at a temperature of 950°F and the primary heat exchanger inlet pres-
sure of 300 psia. The developed head of the pump is approximately 270 ft.

Additional specifications for the coolant pumps are given in Section 4.10.

4.5.3 Steam Superheaters

Steam from the superheaters is divided among several streams. About
20% is uséd to drive the turbogenerators for the production of electricity;
g much smaller fraction is used to drive other turbines which power feed-
water pumps and the steam circulators. The balance is mixed with feedwater
in the Loeffler boiler to produce saturated steam required in the super-
heater. |

A U-tube in U-shell arrengement with fixed tube sheets and counter-
current flow of coolant salt and steam is shown in Fig. 4.11. Coolant
salt is on the shell-side, and steam flows through the tubes. The unit is
mounted on its side to minimize floor space. The shell-side is unbaffled
to minimize pressure drop. The heat transfer coefficient with near-laminar

flow of coolant salt is about 15% less than for baffled flow, and requires

more tubing. To prevent freezing of the salt, the superheater is brought
up to operating temperature by steam generated in an auxiliary, oil-fired
boiler.

Coolant salt operating between 950 and 1100°F circulates through the
shell-side. Steam enters at 670°F and 2490 psi, and leaves at 1000°F and
2465 psi.

4.5.4 Steam Reheaters

In order to provide greater energy availability for the turbine work
cycle and to provide lower pressure steam to drive auxiliary turbines, the
high pressure turbine exhaust steam is directed to the reheaters, the
auxiliary turbines, and the second feedwater heaters. The same general
design criteria apply to the reheaters as to the superheaters, although
the steam is at a lower pressure.

As with the superheaters, the reheaters are constructed of INOR-8
and alloy steel. Eight units provide the desiréd heat transfer surface.
Again, the coolant salt flows in the shell countercurrently to the steam
passing through the tubes. Comparable pressure drop and heat transfer
conditions exist in the reheater as in the superheaters, although baffling
(to improve heat transfer) on the shell introduces a pressure drop of

about 40 psi.
4.6 Power Generation System

4.6,] Introduction

Before selecting the power generation system for the MSCR a number of
alternative approaches were considered in some detail. These included the
use of (a) a mercury boiler, (b) a "Kinyon" boiler, (c) a "Bettis" boiler,
and (d) a "Loeffler" boiler. The characteristics of these alternative

. steam generation systems are summarized as follows.

The use of binary mercury-steam power cycles for power generation
from solid fuel reactors has been studied by Bradfute.etial, (13) and
Randall et al. (92). Kinyon and Romie (55) considered application of the

binary cycle to molten salt reactors. The binary system, in addition to

 
 

54

mitigating the thermal stress problem, has the further advantage of &
higher thermal efficiency (95). On the other hand, bimetallic heat ex-
changers are required at the high temperature end, and it is not obvious
that the fuel salt volume will be small compared to that involved in the
Loeffler system.

The "Kinyon" boiler (53) employs bayonet elements composed of three
concentric tubes. Water is introduced in the annular passage surrounding
the innermost tube and is boiled by heat transferred from superheated
steam flowing downward in the outer annulus. Vapor is separated from the
liquid at the top of the inner annulus; the liquid is routed down the
central tube to a plenum from which it is recycled to the boiling annulus.

Vapor passes down the outer annulus; it is superheated by salt surrounding

the bayonet element and in turn boils the water rising in the inner an-
nulus. This arrangement results in tolerable thermal stresses in the
tubing. . The system avoids the use of steam recirculators. Furthermore,
the bayonet tube boiler may be more compact and less expensive than the
equivalent superheaters and boilers in the Loeffler system. It is not
clear, however, that the required rate of vapor-liquid separation can be
achieved with present technology.

The "Bettis" boiler is a modification of the "Lewis" boiler (59,55)
wherein a bayonet tube containing water and steam is inserted into a
thimble extending down into the fuel salt. An inert buffer salt occupies
the annular space between the pressure tube and the thimble, providing
thermal contact along with physical isolation. This system avoids use of
steam circulators and also eliminates the necessity for pumping the in-

termediate salt.

4.6.2 loeffler Boiler System

In the system selected for the reference design, four boilers gen--
erate steam by direct contact between the steam from the superheaters and
the feed water from the turbine cycle. Four steam compressors circulate
the saturated steam from the boilers through the superheaters of the inert
salt system, providing steam at 2400 psia, 1000°F at the turbine throttle
and at the superheated steam inlet of the Loeffler boilers.

O

55

These boilers, shown in Fig. 4.12, consist of cylindrical drums with
an inside diameter of about 72 in., with distribution pipes for super-
heated steam and feed water located on the vertical centerline and below
the horizontal centerline of each drum. Conventional cyclone steam sepa-
rators, located above the horizontal centerline and arranged in four paral-
lel rows along the inside of the drum, separate the steam from the boiling.
water. A system of scrubber-type steam driers occupies the upper part of
the drum. In operation, superheated steam and feed water are mixed as
they leave the two distribution pipes. and boiling occurs. The boiling
water is guided by internal baffles through the cyclone separators where
the water is removed by centrifugal force. Steam and a small amount of
moisture flow through the scrubbers, where the steam is dried to approxi-
mately 99.7 quality. The drums are fabricated of carbon steel and are
designed for a pressure of 2625 psia. A wall thickness of 7 in. is re-
quired for an inside diameter of 72 in. and a temperature of 650°F. Each
drum is about 100 ft in length and has hemiellipsoidal heads.

4.6.3 Steam Circulators .

- The steam circulators are single-stage axial compressors suitable
for a steam flow of approximately five million lb/hr at a discharge pres-
sure of 2480 psia. The circulators are driven by steam turbines, using
steam from the cold reheat lines of the main turbine-generator. At design
conditions, each circulator requires a power input of 4750 BHP. Steam
from the turbines is returned to the cycle through the feed-water heaters.
One circulator has a motor drive suitable for full flow at design pressure
to be used during start-up shutdown. - An oil-fired package boiler, de-
signed for a saturated steam flow of 50,000 lb/hr at 300 psia, is provided
for startup purposes. -

The system is designed to operate as four 1/4 capacity units; each
unit consists of one Loeffler boiler, one steam circulator and four siuper-
heaters. Valves are located according to this philosophy. Interconnec-
tions between verious units are not provided except at the inlet to the

boilers and the discharge from the superheaters.

4.6.4 Turbogenerator

The turbogenerator is a standard CC6F-RH unit operating at 2400 psia
1000°F and producing a gross electrical output of 1083 Mw. As shown in
Fig. 4.3 the units consist of three turbines: two double-flow high pres-
sure units and one double-flow intermediate pressure unit on one shaft
with a 667 Mw net output plus three double-flow low pressure units on
another shaft with a 416 Mw net output.

The plant auxiliaries have a maximum coincidental loading of 45,000
kw; this power results in a net station output of 1038 Mwe to the station
main power transformers.

Other characteristics of the power generation system are given in

Fig. 4.3 and summarized in Section 4.10.
4.7 Reactor Control System

4.7.1 Introduction

The specifications for the MSCR control system depend on the unique
properties of its fluid-fuel. The main mode of shim control is by adding
UF; to increase reactivity and by replacement of fuel salt with a salt
containing no fissile isotopes to decrease reactivity. This control is
supplemented by operational control with BF3 gas, which is sufficiently
soluble that adequate concentrations may be obtained in the salt by regu-
lating the partial pressure of BF; over the salt surface in the dome.

Fuel is added to compensate burnup and fission product accumulation.

Greater reactivity control is required during startup and shutdown. The

startup procedure involves a gradual increase in power, during which the
rising xenon poisoning (controlled by the flux level) is compensated by
the addition of new fuel. After shutdown, the reactor is sub-critical
for forty hours while 12°Xe: grows in. If longer shutdown is required,
then fifty cubic feet of fuel salt must be removed and replaced by non-
fissile salt. oo EE oo

Emergency shutdown, such as that required in a loss-of -flow accident,
is provided by injecting BF3 gas through tubes opening into the core just
above the bottom support grid. The BF3 will displace fuel, will rapidly

 
 

58

dissolve in the salt, and will diffuse into the graphite. All of these
processes will result in a rapid and large decrease in reactivity.

pi

4.7.2 Shim Control

For shim control by fuel addition or removal, .two reactivity-control
drain tanks of 50 cubic ft capacity each and a shim-control salt-addition
tank of 50 cubic ft capacity are located in the reactor containment cell.
All tanks are provided with vents to the reactor dome, gas connections
to the helium pressurizing system, and several 100 kw electric heaters
for initial vessel heating and maintaining stored salt temperature. The
addition tank is essentially in parallel with the 2 cubic ft salt-addition
metering tank. The drain tank is connected to the reactor vessel upper
plenum and is installed with respect to the reactor dome liquid level so
that overfilling will not be possible. Freeze valves are used to isolate
the tanks from the reactor. The reactivity control drain tanks must have,
in addition to heating coils, decay heat removal facilities similar to the
fuel salt drain tanks. They have an independent steam condenser and heat
removal system which will be 1/20 the size of the fuel drain tank heat

removal system.

4.7.3 Emergency Control

The BF; addition system comprises pressure cylinders manifolded to a
heater. BF3 flow control and quick-acting injection valves are incorpos=-.-
rated in the supply line connected to the bottom plenum of the reactor
vessel. The flow control facility is operated from the shim control in-

strumentation and the quick-acting injection system is operated from the

"scram" circuits.

The BF3 gas is stored in six 330 cubic ft, 2000 psi cylinders located
outside and adjacent to the east wall of the reactor building. The speci-
fications for the reactivity-control drain tanks and the reactivity-control

salt-addition tank are given in Section 4.10.

4.8 Salt Handling Systems

4.8.1 Introduction

Facilities for handling both fresh and spent fuel salt and inter-
mediate coolant salt constitute the heart of the MSCR complex. The func-
tions which must be performed include melting, purifying, charging, re-
moval, storage, and sampling of the salt. These are accomplished by means

of the following systems and facilities shown in Fig. 4.13.

a. Fuel salt preparation

b. Coolant salt preparation

c. Reactor salt purification

k. Coolant salt sampling

4.8.2 Fuel Salt Preparation

 

Fuel salt is received in solid form and must be liquified prior to
processing. Barren salt, having the same composition as the intermediate
coolant salt, i.e., 66% LiF and 34% BeFp, with a liquidus temperature of
851°F is used for preoperational testing and system flushing before and
after maintenance activity. A solid mixture having this composition is
charged initially. Sufficient LiF and ThF, are added to form composition
68% LiF, 23% BeF, and 9% ThF,. All mixtures are processed through the
same equipment. After routine operation is established, flush salt is
the base material for the lithium/thorium addition process. In this man-
ner, flush salt contaminated by fission products may be consumed and
special treatment for removal of fission products will be unnecessary.

A 12-ft-high, 150 cubic ft tank enclosed by an 8-ft-high, 150 kw

furnace receives solid salt for melting. The furnace, located in the

flush-salt storage area, is designed for melting approximately 7 £43 /hr.
Molten salt is transferred by pressure siphoning.

Solid salt is added by means of a tube extending from the floor above
the storage area to the melt tank. The top of the tube is flanged and
sealed. A valve is located just below the flange. The tube takes a
devious route and is provided with a helium purge to prevent back-flow of
radioactive material and intolerable radiation levels at the open feed
point. A check valve just below the flange allows purge gas to be dis
rected into the melt tank. A portable hopper is connected to the flange
face to receive salt from the shipping containers. A portable shed covers
the work area to prevent the spread of toxic dust resulting from the feed

operation.

4.8.3 Coolant Salt Preparation

Equipment and system design are similar to that of fuel-salt melt
tank and solid salt feed. The melt tank is located in the heat exchanger
room near the chemical treatment tank. Solid salt is fed from the floor

above.

4.8.4 Reactor Salt Purification

The reactor fuel and flush salts are purified in the molten state
prior to charging or storing. This is done initially to remove oxides,
and subsequently, to remove oxides and other contaminants.

In normal operation, a chemical treatment tank of 100 cubic ft ca=-
pacity located in the flush-salt storage area receives the molten salt.

After a one-day holdup for purification, the salt is transferred to stor-

age tanks. By the addition of LiF and ThF, to flush salt ‘in the melt

tank, fertile salt is formed; this is then transferred to the fertile salt

- purification tank where. gaseous HF and ‘Hp. are bubbled through the liquid
“to remove oxides. Subsequently, the treated salt is transferred to the

100 - cubic ft salt-storage tank installed at tHe same location. Flush-salt

make-up is processed in the same manner, and through the same equipment.

- After treatment, it is transferred to a spare flush-salt tank.

For the initial charges of flush salt and fertile salt for the reac-

tor system, greater purifying capacity is required in order to avoid delay

 
 

62

in preoperational testing and power production. To fulfill this condi-
tion, HF and Hz bubbling facilities are providéd in the fertile salt stor-
age tank end temporary flanged lines arranged so that the fertile salt
tank may receive molten salt from the melt tank, perform partial purifi-
cation and allow transfer of the salt to the normal treatment tank. In
this manner the two tanks, fertile storage and chemical treatment, are
placed in series to double both the purification rate and the system salt
charging rate. This procedure does not increase the sampling or analysis

requirements over those necessary for normal operation.

4.8.5 Coolant-Salt Purification

The purpose of the coolant salt purification system is to remove
impurities such as corrosion products or oxides which could cause fouling
of surfaces and plugging of lines and tubes if allowed to accumulate. .

It is unlikely that a single coolant. charge could be used for the
whole lifetime of the reactor without exceeding permissible concentrations
of oxides or corrosion products; however, it probably will not be neces=-"
sary to employ a continuous treatment of coolant salt. Oxides may get into
the coolant salt by accidental exposure to air or water vapor, or from
oxygen present as an impurity in the cover gas used to pressurize the
coolant-salt systems. Although the rate of corrosion of INOR-8 surfaces
by coolant salt is low, the area of metal surface in contact with coolant
salt is very large, so that corrosion products are certain to accumulate.
When it becomes necessary to repurify the coolant salt, it is done batch-
wise, one coolant circuit per batch, at infrequent intervals during peri~’
ods of reactor shutdown.

If the coolant salt should bécome contaminated with fission products
or uranium as a result of a leak in the primary heat exchanger (an event
not likely to occur because the coolant salt system is kept at a pressure
higher than that of the fuel salt), the contaminated coolant salt is

.drained from the affected circuit to a drain tank, and then transferred

to the chemical processing plant for disposal.

4.8.6 Reactor Salt Charging System

Fuel salt without uranium is injected into the primary reactor cir-
cuit by manual control from a small salt addition tank to replenish the
fuel salt withdrawn for chemical processing (two cubic ft per day). This
addition is made remotely and with assurance that fuel salt will not flow
back into the addition system. The make-up is fed into the reactor in a
molten condition by gravity flow or under pressure. Sufficient electrical
heating to maintain the salt in a molten condition prior to injection is
provided.

A two-cubic-ft salt addition tank (metering tank) is located on the
wall of the biological shield at a level somewhat above the liquid level
in the reactor. The tank is supplied from the fertile-salt storage tank
situated in the flush salt storage area. Makeup is accomplished by open-
ing the freeze valve and the vent valve between the tank and reactor dome.
The freeze-valve in the line leading to the reactor dome must be placed
at the bottom of a loop so that when the tank is empty a heel of salt will

remain in the valve.

 

 

Molten coolant salt is injected into any one of the eight intermedi-:
ate coolant loops from the coolant drain tanks at a rate up to 600 £t3/hr.
The drain lines from several locations in each of the eight intermediate

coolant loops also serve as charging lines for this operation.
4.8.8 UF, Addition Facility

During steady-state operation at equilibrium, about 6 keg/day of UF,
are added to the reactor to compensate for burnup and a fuel withdrawal
of 2 £t?/day. The amount and rate of addition of Us to the reactor is
governed by reactivity and temperature requirements. Valves in the UF,
addition system must be. kept gas-tight when closed even ‘though they must
pass solids when opened, but since they will be in a region of relatively

low radiation level, plastic seats {for non-scoring properties) may be

used.

The UF; charged into the reactor system is prepared by mixing re-
cycled uranium with fresh uranium. Pellets about 0.75-in. in diam, fab-
ricated by casting UF, in an inert atmosphere, are charged into a gas-
tight shielded shipping container, containing an atmosphere of dry helium
at approximately 1 atmosphere absolute pressure. At the reactor, the
shielded shipping container is mounted on the fuel charging machine (which
is located above the reactor), and the mated assembly of the shipping con-
tainer and fuel charging machine is made gas-tight by bolting a gasketed
flange. Figure 4.14 shows a schematic sketch of the UF, addition facility.

4.8.9 Fuel Salt Drain and Storage System

Facilities are provided for the drainage and storage of fuel salt
during periods of maintenance and emergency shutdown. The system is shown
on the flow diagram in Fig. 4.2. All salt circuits have drain comnec-
tions; this includes the primary heat exchangers as well as the reactor
vessel. The draining of the fuel salt is accomplished quickly, even under
emergency condition without steam flow and auxiliary power, since without
heat removal the salt temperatures rise 300—400°F in the first helf hour.
Four equally spaced 2-in. drain lines connected radially to the bottom
plenum of the reactor vessel, with l-in. interconnections to the primary
heat exchangers drain connections, will drain the reactor system in ap-
proximately one-half hour after the freeze valves are opened.

The tanks are capable of receiving the full inventory of the reactor
within half an hour, maintaining the stored volume of salt at a tempera-
ture of less than 1400°F, and recharging it to the reactor. Gravity drain
and gas pressure are used for transferring salt.

Because forced circulation may not be available under emergency con-
ditions, natural convection cooling is provided in small-diem cylindrical
vessels. - Fifty-four vertically mounted 35-in. ID cylinders 8 ft long are
located in a 10-ft trench around the inside periphery of the reactor con-
tainment cell. Each cylinder is immersed in a molten alkali metal car-
bonate bath. The carbonate mixture is contained in a double-walled tank

which serves as a boiler for the removal of decay heat from the fuel salt.

Fifteen-kilowatt electric heaters are arranged within the carbonate mix- - \o’

ture annulus for fuel-s&glt melting following long: storage periods and.

temperature maintenance during shorter periods. The heaters are sized to
bring the salt to 1100°F in four days.

4.8.10 Coolant Salt Drain System

These drain tanks have several purposes: (a) to provide storage Ce
space for the complete volume of coolant contained in two (out of eight)
coolant circuits during periods. when it is necessary to drain the coolant
from one circuit for maintenance; (b) to provide the reservoir and the
application of motive force for transferring coolant salt into the reac-
tor coolant circuits during initial salt-charging; and (c¢) to serve as a
transfer point from which coolant salt may be removed from the system and
transferred to shipping containers in ‘case it should become necessary to
process contaminated coolant salt.

The drain tanks are located at an elevation which permits the coolant
salt to flow by gravity from the reactor coolant system into the drain
tanks. The transfer lines are valved with freeze-valves to permit flow
to or from any one of the 8 coolant circuits. The transfer lines are
large enough to fill one coolant circuit in one hour,vusing a gas pressure

of 50 psig.

4.8.11 Spent Fuel Withdrawal System

Fuel salt is drawn from the reactor vessel drain line at about 30
psia into the vented metering tank. The metering tank is a 4=in. (ID): by
25-ft-long cylindrical vessel located at an elevation such that when flow
stops it contains two cubic ft of fuel salt. Vent connections above the
salt in the tank lead to the dome on the reactor vessel. Decay-heat re-
movel is accomplished by radiation and convection to the reactor contain-
ment cell atmosphere. Because the heat generation rate diminishes rapidly,
the rate of removal is controlled by means of an insulated Jacket 4 in.
thick surrounding the tank, and separated from it by a small air gap. A
temperature-actuated bellows opens the jacket to allow excess heat to be
radiated to the room. A 12-kw electric heater provides preheating and
aids in maintaining desired salt temperature when the tank is full.

After a 24-hr holdup, the salt is released by gravity drain to a
transfer tank. When a 10 f£t3 batch of salt is accumulated, the salt is

™"w

67

transferred to a shipping flask, which is placed in a shielded cask and
shipped by rail to a central processing plant. Spent fuel is accumulated
for about 120 days at the processing plant, and is then processed in about
6 days.

Should it be necessary or desirable to hold spent fuel at the reactor
site (Section 5.3.4), five 35 ft? intermediate storage tanks are provided.
Heat is removed by boiling water in steam jackets; the steam generated is

condensed in water-cooled condensers.

4.8.12 High Level Radioactive Salt Sampler

The high level radioactive salt sampler shown in Fig. 4.15 is used
to obtain samples of fuel or flush salt from several points such as the
reactor (via the fuel withdrawal tank), the transfer tank in the shipping
area, the fuel drain tanks, or the flush-salt chemical treatment tank, and
to deliver these samples to an adjoining hot cell for chemical analysis.

Sampling is accomplished by means of access ducts located at appro-
priate points. These are mounted vertically with no pitch less than 50°
from the horizontal. They are large enough to allow the free passage of
the sample capsule, and are equipped with a sample capsule cage at. the
sampling point to limit the depth in the salt melt reachéd by the capsule
and prevent the end of the cable from dipping in the salt.

The thief sampler principle is employed wherein an open sample
capsule made in the form of a thick-walled, round-bottomed bucket hanging
on a flexible cable is lowered into the salt-containing vessel. The cap-
sule sinks below the surface and is filled with salt which solidifies when
the sample capsule is withdrawn to a cooler region above the sample point.
After solidificetion, the capsule is pulled up through the sampler access

‘duct into the sampler cavity in which is located the cable drive mechanism.

Once in the sampler cavity, the capsule is positioned over a second duct

leading to a hot analytical cell. The sample capsule is lowered through

the second duct and deposited in ‘the hot cell. Using a suitable manipu-

lator, which is part of the hot cell equipment; the sample capsule is de-

tached from the end of the cable, and a new sample capsule is attached.
The new sample capsule is then pulled up into the sampler cavity in readi-

ness for another sampling operation.

The sampler cavity is connected to the hot cell and to each of the
four sample points by five separate sample access ducts. Each duct is
made of 1 1/2-in. Sch. 40 pipe and contains two 1 1/2-in. double-disc gate
valves. The bottom valve is closed only in the event the upper valve is

removed for repair or replacement

4.8.13 Coolant Salt Sampling

Coolant salt sampling connections for a portable sampling device are
provided on the eight coolant loops and the chemical treatment tank. Sam-
ples are also drawn from the eight coolant-salt pump bowls and from the
make-up salt chemical-treatment tank. A portable, single-sample holding
device receives the sample in a manner similar to that of the high level
radioactive salt sampler, transports the sample to the hot cell area, de-
posits the sample capsule in the hot cell, and receives a fresh capsule
from the hot cell. The connection between the portable sampler and cool-
ant salt system is of a lock type, has a gas-tight fitting and operates in
an inert atmosphere (possibly radioactive) from full vacuum to 200 psia
at 100°F.

4.8.14 Freeze Valves

Freeze valves are used to close off all lines used for transferring
salt from one location to another. - These valves are formed in any size
of pipe up to 2 in. in diam by pinching the pipe to form a rectangular
shaped flow passage. In a 2-in. pipe, the flattened section is about 0.5
in. thick and 2 in. long. Closure of the valve is accomplished by freez-
ing salt inside the pipe. This is done by directing jets of cold air
against the top and bottom surfaces of the flattened portion. The air,

"supplied by a Rootes-Connersville blower, is controlled to regulate the

rate of freezing. Subsequent thawing of the salt plug is achieved in a

few minutes by means of a Calrod electric heater (3000 watts for a 2-in.

line) bent in a saddle-shaped series of turns conformal to the flat sec-

tion. This heater is easily removed for maintenance.

4.9.2 Helium Cover Gas Supply and Distribution System

The helium inert cover gas system serves a number of functions, viz:
(a) as a pressurizing gas in various salt containing vessels for the
transfer of salt from one place to another; (b) as a carrier gas for the
removal of volatile fission products from the recycle gas purge system;
(c) as an inert atmosphere to protect against contamination of the salt
in places such as the UF, system, samplers, melt tank atmospheres, etc.,
which are occasionally opened to the atmosphere; (d) as a gas seal and
bearing lubricant in molten salt pumps; (e) to provide the pressures re-
quired in the fuel salt and coolant salt circuits to prevent pump cavita-
tion, and to avoid leakage of fuel salt into the coolant salt in case of
a leak in the primary heat exchangers; and (f) to pressurize leak-detec-
tion devices at various flanged joints and disconnects.

Since the helium comes into contact with fuel salt or with inter-
mediate coolant salt it must be free from oxide-containing impurities such
as HO, SO,, etc; therefore, a purification system is necessary as shown

in Fig. 4.16. The raw helium is supplied from a trailer having a capacity

of 39,000 std. cubic ft in 30 cylinders at 2400 psi. An emergency supply
of 2400 std. cubic ft is supplied from twelve 200 std. cubic ft cylinders.
As shown in the flow diagram duplicate lines of helium purification units

are provided. Each has a capacity of 1.5 scfm.

4.9.2 Reagent Gas Supply and Disposal System

A reagent mixture consisting of 80% anhydrous hydrogen fluoride and
20% hydrogen is used to remove oxide impurities from reactor and inter-
mediate coolant salts. Unreacted reagent gas may contain radioactive
material, and thus must be handled by both the gaseous and liquid waste
disposal systems.

The reagent gases are supplied from high pressure cylinders provided
with pressure reducers and flow control instruments so that the flow may
be adjusted (Fig. 4.16). The mixed reagent gas 1s bubbled through molten
salt contained in the fuel-salt and the coolant-salt chemical treatment
tanks. Unreacted reagent gas passes through a potassium hydroxide (KOH)
scrubber to remove HF, and through a hydrogen burner to remove hydrogen.
Spent caustic and condensate from the hydrogen burner may contain radio-
active material and thus must be sent to the liquid waste disposal system
for concentration and ultimate shipment to a remote disposal area. Non-
condensibles from the hydrogen burner are cooled and vented from the sys-

tem through the gaseous waste disposal system.

4.9.4 Waste Gas System

As mentioned previously, helium is passed through the dome above the
core to carry away xenon and other volatile fission products. In addi-
tion, purge gas is passed down around the shafts of the fuel pumps to
sweep away fission products diffusing toward the upper, oil-lubricated
bearings. Also, there is helium cover gas in the bowls of the pumps, in
the dump tanks, in the fuel handling system, etc., and all of these must
be purged to some extent. In order to limit radioactivity in the atmo-
sphere surrounding the reactor site, the off-gas from these various sys-
tems is passed through charcoal beds to trap the fission products until

they have decayed, as shown in Fig. 4.16. A few long-lived isotopes,
[2]

C

 

 

 

73

particularly 85kr, decay but little in the charcoal beds, and hence con-
siderable dilution with air is required to limit the concentration of
these in the stack discharge.

If the BF; addition system is ever used to effect a "scram" of the
reactor, it will be necessary to remove the BF3 from the reactor system
before normal reactor operation can be restored. A stripped unit removes
BF; from the recycle helium stream to avoid saturating the off-gas ad- =

sorber as shown in the flow diagram (Fig. 4.16).

4.9.5 Liquid Waste Disposal System

Liquid wastes originate in the drains and sumps of the various equip-
ment cells. Typical sources are hot sinks in the analytical laboratory,
cell drains in the shipping area where the shipping cask will be flushed
with decontaminants, the contaminated equipment storage and decontamina=:’.c
tion cell, and spent caustic solutions from the reagent-gas disposal sys-
tem. The liquid waste system shown in Fig. 4.16 provides for holdup, con-
centration, and storage of active wastes on-site. High level wastes are
concentrated by evaporation and stored in underground tanks. Low-level
wastes may be held in underground tanks or in a low-level activity pond
until they have decayed sufficiently for discharge into the river. The
capacity of this pond is approximately 25,000 cubic ft (nearly twice the
volume of the contaminated equipment storage cell).

Intermediate wastes are sent to ten 10,000-gallon stainless steel
retention tanks, which are used for’stemporary storage until it is possible
to send the waste to an evaporator for concentration.

High level wastes from the plant and from the evaporator are sent to
a 10,000-gallon waste-storage tank which provides semi-permanent storage
of these wastes, which will ultimately be transferred to shielded shipping
containers for shipment to a permanent disposal area.

Spent caustic wastes from the reagent gas disposal system are sent to

the intermediate-level storage tank for further concentration and ultimate

disposal off-site.

Pumps (mechanical, air jet, or steam jet) are provided at every sump,
at the pond, at the 10,000-gallon tanks, at the evaporator tank, and at
the 1000-gallon tanks to transfer the liquids.

 
 

 

 

74

The waste evaporator is capable of evaporating 200 gallons of water
per hour using the plant heating steam. The condenser drains either to
the retention tank or to the low level waste pond, depending on the ac-
tivity. A vent on the shell side allows noncondensibles to be vented to
the charcoal beds.

4.9.6 Coolant Pump Lubricating Oil Systems

These systems supply oil to the bearings of eight pumps in the fuel
circuits and to eight pumps in the intermediate coolent loops. The two
groups of eight pumps each are supplied by two independent systems. The
lubricant is circulated under oxygen-free conditions, 120 gpm to each
pump group. The systems are designed to 120°F supply with an expected

oil temperature rise of 20°F.

4.9.7 Preheating System

Prior to the admission of salt, all salt-containing piping and equip-
ment must be preheated to 900°F . This is accomplished by the use. of
several types of resistance heating. In sizes up to about 2 in., piping
is heated by passing an alternating current through the piping itself.
All pipes heated this way are electrically insulated. larger diameter
salt-containing pipes are heated by hinged resistance heaters (2000 w/ft)
surrounding the pipe. For large pipes (above 10 in.) a three-section
heater assembly is used. Piping fittings are covered by prefabricated
heating units. Heaters for pumps are field-fabricated.

The reactor vessel and primary heat exchangers are heated by tubular
resistance heaters attached to the outer surfaces by means of clips on
-welded studs.

4.9.8 Auxiliary Power .

Auxiliary power is supplied at 4160 volts by a pair of auxiliary
power transformers, type OA/FA, 24-4.16 kv with a maximum fan-cooled
rating of 25 Mva. A reserve transformer, fed from the switchyard bus,
serves. as a standby unit. The loads fed at 4160 volts include all motors

rated at 150 horsepower or more, and the auxiliary power transformers

O

required for station lighting, 480 volt auxiliaries, and the fuel melting
and preheating system.

Smaller auxiliaries, of 30 horsepower or less, and those whose con-
tinuous operation is not considered vital to station operation, are fed
from motor control centers in the vicinity of the load. Two 15 kva 480-
120 volt transformers supply a 115 volt a-c control and instrumentation
bus for each unit. An emergency supply to this bus is provided from a
15 kva inverter motor-generator set which is driven by the unit 250-volt

battery.

4.9.9 Service Water System

The service water system supplies river water for cooling purposes
throughout the plant, including the reactor auxiliaries and the turbine
plant components.

Water is supplied by three 15,000 gpm, half-capacity, vertical cen-
trifugal pumps. Each pump is driven by a 1250-horsepower motor, and is
located in the circulating water intake structure. During normal opera-
tion two pumps supply the system with water at 100 psig, with the third
pump employed as a standby.

4.9.10 Control and Station Air Systems

The compressed air system for the plant consists of separate, inter-
connected air supplies for the station and for control purposes. The
station air system supplies hose valves for operating and maintenance re-
quirements throughout the station. Control air is used primarily for in-
strument transmitters and air-operated valves. The two air systems are
cross connected. 50 that compressed air may be supplied to the control air
system in event of a compressor failure.

The control air system of the plant supplies air-operated control
devices at a header pressure of 115 psia and is reduced to 55 psia and

45 psia for supply to various drive units and instrument transmitters.

4.9.11 Cranes and Hoists

A single traveling bridge crane serves the reactor and steam turbine

buildings. Its lifting capacity is based on handling the rotor of the

 
 

 

76 B ~

low pressure steam turbine-generator, which weighs about 150 tons. The
bridge span is 130 ft, and the crane lift is sufficient to reach the low-
est portion of the building. All heavy equipment coming into the building
by rail may be handled by the crane. Its capacity is sufficient to allow
removal of all components within the reactor primary shield except the

reactor.

4.9.12 Instrumentation and Control

The requirements for instrumentation and control of the turbine sys-

tems are similar to those of the turbine system in a conventional fossil-

i"

fuel power plant.

Instrumentation for the reactor system monitors the reactor neutron
flux, primary system pressures, temperatures, levels, and flow rates, and
provides control and alarm signals to actuate the appropriate device or
to call for operator action when changes occur in the measured quantities,
through either changes in load or malfunction of system components.

Control and instrumentation panels are located in the control room,
for convenience of reading, recording and operating the most important
quantities and components. Other auxiliary control panels or isolated
instruments may be located at appropriate places in the plant; area radia-
tion monitors, alarm or warning signals, hydrogen and seal oil controls

for the generators, etc.

4.9.13 Plant Utilities

The plant utilities include those systems that are provided for moni- -

I“

toring plant equipment, disposing of nonradioactive wastes, safety of
personnel, protection of equipment and for heating, ventilating and air-
conditioning the plant buildings. These systems do not differ appreciably
from those provided for conventional plants.

5. FUEL PROCESSING

5.1 Reprocessing System

Fluorination of spent fuel from the MSCR to recover isotopes of ura-
nium, followed by discard of the carrier salt (containing LiF, BeF,, ThFy,
and fission product fluorides), was selected as the method of processing
for several reasons: (a) The fluorination process is well adapted for
future integration with the reactor plant (sharing shielding and mainte-
nance facilities and personnel) with appreciable potential reductions in
fuel cycle cost (Sec. 6.9); (b) the necessity for holding the spent fuel
for decay of radioactivity is eliminated; (c¢) no development is required;
the plant may be designed and costed on the basis of current technology.

In order to use the next most applicable process, Thorex, it would be
necessary to develop special head-end and tail-end steps for converting
spent fuel from the fluoride to the nitrate and back again. Also it would
be necessary to hold the spent fuel prior to processing for not less than
120 days (to average the equivalent of 90 days of cooling). Further, there
is some uncertainty concerning the effect of fluoride ion on the chemistry
of the aqueous separations, On the other hand, the thorium could be recov-
ered, and perhaps ‘also the carrier salt could be recovered free from con-
tamination with rare earth isotopes. It would, however, be contaminated
with the isotopes Cd, Sr, Ag, Cs, Se, Ba, and Te,

The processing costs for the MSCR fuel have been estimated for both

processes,
5.2 Fluoride Volatility Central Plant

A central plant capable of processing about 30 £t3 of fuel salt per

day (1 tonne Th/day) was selected for costing, This plant is capable of
servicing about 20 reference design MSCR's having a total capability of
120,000 Mwe.

Component design, plant layout, and associated costs for the plant
described herein were adapted from a design and cost study of an on-site

plant prepared by Carter, Milford, and Stockdale in a prior study (21).

 
 

 

92

Due allowance for fuel transport to a central location was made, together
with other adjustments for difference in capacities, elimination of prot-

actinium recycle, etc,

5.2.1 Process Design

The steps of the proposed fluorination process are indicated in
Fig, 5.1: Spent fuel is transferred from the shipping containers to pre-
fluorination storage by applying gas pressure or by siphoning. The fuel
is then introduced batch-wise into the fluorinators where it is treated
with elemental fluorine, possibly diluted with some inert gas, at about
1000°F, The effluent UF is absorbed in beds of NaF at 200°F, is later
desorbed at 700°F and collected in cold traps at ~45°F, Periodically the
cold traps are warmed, and the decontaminated UF, is collected in cylinders.
The fluoride volatility process does not provide for recovering
thorium or any of the components of the carrier salt. Consequently, after

fluorination the LiF-BeF ~ThF, -FP melt is drained into interim waste stor-

2

age, and later transferred to permanent waste storage such as, for example,

in a salt mine. The interim storage period has been taken to be 1100 days,
a value corresponding to the most favorable economic balance between on-
site and permanent storage charges for this particular process.

It will be observed that 233pa is not recovered in this process. An
analysis of Pa recovery versus discard disclosed that additional process
equipment and building space requirements made the recovery of Pa
uneconomical.

A major problem in the design of vessels which contain irradiated salt
is that of heat removal. Volumetric heat release rates are high, and the
temperature of the heat source is considerably greater than that of con-
ventional heat sinks (such as cooling water from rivers or wells). In the
design evolved, heat is transferred across an air gap into water. The
principal heat transfer mechanism is radiation; convection accounts for
perhaps 5 to 10 per cent of the transfer. This arrangement, in addition
to controlling the heat transfer rate at tolerable levels, provides iso~
lation of the coolant from the molten salt so that a leak of either stream

through its containment wall does not contaminate the other stream.

The fluorinators are cooled by circulating air through the cell, In
the case of the prefluorination storage tanks, radiation from storage
vessels to a concentric tank in a water bath provides sufficient cooling
for 5-day-old fuel salt.

Wherever possible, the equipment was patterned after that used in the
ORNL Volatility Pilot Plant described by Milford (66), Carr (18), Cathers
et al. (22, 23), :

5.2.2 Shipping

Shipment of irradiated fuel is made in a lead shielded carrier shown
in Fig. 5.2. The cask is equipped with a water-cooling system which is
able to absorb decay heat radiated from the salt container and to dissipate
this heat to the atmosphere via finned tube exchangers fastened to the out-
side of the cask. Heat transfer may be either by boiling the water in the
inside jacket followed by condensation in the outside exchanger, or by
natural convection.

The shipping container (also used for waste disposal), is designed to

hold ~10 £t3 salt which is about six days accumulation at the reactor dis-

charge rate of 1.67 £t3/day. For this design it has been assumed that the

processing plant is located 500 miles from the reactor site and that ship-
ment will be made by rail. The round trip, including filling and emptying,
is anticipated to take 10 days. The average age of spent fuel at shipment

is approximately 5 days.

5.2.3 Prefluorination Storage Tanks

3 tanks receive up to 120 days supply of

One hundred and sixty 30 ft
spent fuel from each of a number of reactor sites, When a 120-day batch
is completed, the tanks are removed from their cooling jackets to .the
transfer area where the material is transferred to 6-£t> metering transfer
tanks, From these tanks the spent fuel can be transferred by gravity or
inert gas pressure to the fluorinators.

The cooling jackets for the prefluorination storage tanks are stain-
less steel tanks 2.2 ft in diameter by 12 ft high immersed in a water bath.

Cooling is achieved principally by radiation from the storage tank to the

5.2.4 Fluorinator

The design shown in Fig. 5.3 has been successfully operated in the
ORNL Fluoride Volitility Pilot Plant (18). Surmounting the fluorination
chamber is a de-entrainment section. The lower chamber is surrounded by an
electrically-heated furnace while the upper is heated with electrical strip
heaters, Five units are required, each having a capacity of 6 £t3. The
corrosion rate is about 1 mil per hour of fluorination time; hence the
fluorinator must be inexpensive and accessible for frequent replacement,
It was designed to dissipate decay heat and heat of reaction to the atmos-
phere in the cell through a wall 1/2 in. thick at a temperature of SO00°F.
The preferred materials of construction are either INOR-8 or Alloy 79-4
(70 per cent Ni, 4 per cent Mo, 17 per cent Fe). L-Nickel has been used
for fluorinator construction but is susceptible to intergranular attack.

Spent fuel is fluorinated batchwise at about 1000°F, It takes about
6 hours to volatilize the uranium (99.9+%) from a 6 ft batch. In current
practice the attack of fluorine on the vessel is severe, The high rate of
corrosion is believed to result from the combined action of liquid salt
and gaseous fluorine phases, However, several lines of improvement are
under investigation. These include the use of the "frozen wall" fluori-
nator (35) wherein a layer of solid salt is maintained on the vessel wall
by proper control of the cooling, and this layer protects the wall.
Another approach consists of spraying the molten salt into a relatively
cool atmosphere of fluorine. Uranium hexafluoride is formed in and rapidly
removed from the microdroplets which then cool and freeze before they
strike the wall. Not only are the wall temperatures lower, but there is no
liquid phase in contact with the wall, |

The fluorides of some fission products, notably Mo, Zr, Nb, Cs, Ru,
and Te are volatile and accompany the UF. These are separated from the
uranium in the CRP trap and NaF absorber described below. It is not ex-

pected that the fluoride of Pa will be volatile under conditions specified,

Protactinium will remain in the barren salt and be lost to waste. The loss
amounts to about 10 g/day in the reference design reactor, and studies have
shown that it is not economical to recycle the barren salt to the fluori-
nators after holding it to allow the Pa to decay. The cost increase of
additional fluorinator capacity and interim storage vessels more than off~-

sets the value of the 233y pecovered,

5.2.5 CRP Trap and NaF Absorbers

After leaving the fluorinator, UF. and accompanying fission product

fluorides pass into a two-zoned NaF option system, The first, called
the complexible radioactive products (CRP) trap is operated at about 400°C
and removes fluorides of chromium, zirconium, niobium, cesium, strontium,
and rare earths, as well as entrained salt particles. Uranium hexafluoride
is not absorbed here, but is absorbed in the second zone operated at 100°C,
along with the fluorides of molybdenum and ruthenium, and traces of others.
Some ruthenium carries through into the fluorine recirculation system.

Uranium is recovered from the beds by desorption at 400°C, It is
collected in cold traps described below.

The stationary bed absorber, shown in Fig. 5.4, contains just over
one cubic foot of NaF. Six unites are required. Each is mounted in a
lightweight, low-heat capacity electric furnace which opens on hinges for
removal of the absorber. A cooling-heating tube 2-1/2 inches OD carrying
coolant and containing electric heaters extends through the center of the
bed. An interior cylindrical baffle forces the process stream to follow a
U-shaped path through the bed.

Design limitations arise in the rate at which the bed temperature can
be cycled and the bed thickness. The granular bed is a rather effective
insulator and must be made in thin sections to facilitate heating and cool~-
ing. The absorbers therefore have large length-diameter ratios, )

When the bed becomes saturated with fission products, the absorber is

removed from the furnace, emptied, and recharged remotely in a 4-5 day

cycle,

5.2,6 Cold Traps

These are similar to those used in the ORNL Fluoride Volatility Pilot
Plant as shown in Fig, 5.5. Two traps are mounted in series. The first
is operated at about -40°C and the second at -60°C,

Adequate surface for rapid transfer of heat and collection of solid
UF, must be provided. The components must have small thermal inertia so
that the temperature may be changed quickly. During defrosting, the traps

are heated to 90°C at 46 psia to allow UF. to melt and drain to collection

6
cylinders,

5.2,7 Reduction Reactor

The reduction of UF, to UF, is accomplished in a reactor patterned
after that described by Murray (70) and consists of a 4-in, diam by 10-ft
high column, Uranium hexafluoride and flourine are mixed with excess H, in
a nozzle at the top of the reaction chamber. The uranium is reduced in the
H,-F, flame, and falls to the bottom of the chamber where it is collected
in molten salt of suitable composition. Gaseous materials are discharged
through a filter. The reactor has a capacity of 10-15 kg of UF per hour,

Losses are very low and typically are less than 0.1 per cent.

5.2.8 Transfer Tanks

Stripped fuel is drained from the fluorinators into transfer tanks
(two each) from whence it is distributed to interim waste storage tanks.
The transfer tanks have capacities of 60 £13, Decay heat is radiated from
the surface of the tank through a 1/2 in. air gap to a water-cooled jacket.
While being held in the transfer tanks, the salt is treated with He or
other inert gas to remove traces of EF, of HF that would incréase corrosion

in the waste storage tanks,

5.2.9 Waste Storage Tanks

Waste salt is stored in stainless steel shipping cylinders 2 ft in
diam by 8 ft long. These are placed at the bottom of steel thimbles
2,75 ft in diam and fifteen feet long which dip into a water-filled

canal. Heat is dissipated by radiation and convection across the 4-inch

air gap, through the thimble wall and into the water, After cooling, the

tanks are shipped to a salt mine for permanent storage.

5.2.10 Freeze Valves

Conventional valves cannot be used with molten salts. Flow stoppage
is achieved by freezing a plug of salt in a section of a line with a jet of
cooling air. Electric heaters are used to thaw the plug when flow is

desired. A freeze valve for the MSRE is shown in Fig. 5.6.

5.2.11 Samplers

The apparatus pictured in Fig, 5.7 is being tested for use with the -
MSRE (12). Essential features are the hoist and capsule for removing the
sample from the vessel; a lead-shielded cubicle with manipulator, heating .
elements and service piping, and a transport cask for removing the sample
from the process area. The sampling cubicle is mounted on the cell biolo-

gical shield in an accessible area.

5.2.12 Biological Shield

Calculations were made using the Phoebe program for the IBM 704 com-
puter, In the study by Carter, Milford, and Stockdale (21), on which the
present estimate is based, spent fuel was brought to the processing plant
immediately after removal from the reactor, and the shield was accordingly
made quite thick. In the present instance, the fuel is cooled at the pro-
cessing plant for not less than 90 days so that the shielding requirements
are not as extreme. However, in order that the central plant have more

general utility, no reduction in shield thickness was made.

5.2,13 Process Equipment Layout

Process equipment is laid out according to the major process opera-
tions: prefluorination storage, fluorination, transfer, NaF absorption,

cold traps and product collection, UF, + UF, reduction, and interim waste

6
storage. Equipment is grouped in cells according to activity level and in

an arrangement that minimizes distances between vessels. Three transfers

oO"

of molten salt are required in the processing sequence.

Interim waste storage vessels are located adjacent to the processing
area in a large canal,

To facilitate remote maintenance, vessels are arranged so that all
equipment is accessible from above, and all process and service lines can
be connected remotely. Over-all building space is dictated by remote

maintenance considerations rather than by actual vessel size.

5.2.14 Plant Layout

In order to establish uniformity in cost estimation of nuclear power
plants, the Atomic Energy Commission has specified certain ground rules
(52) covering topography, meteorology, climatology, geology, availability
of labor, accounting procedures, fixed charge rates, etc. These ground
rules were used in this study.

Advantage was taken of a design study and operating experience with a
remotely maintained radioactive chemical plant reported by Farrow (32) to
obtain over-all plant arrangements, as shown in Fig. 5.8.

The hypothetical site location is 500 miles from the reactor site,

The plant is located on a stream that is navigable by boats having up to
6-ft draft. There is convenient highway and railroad access. The plant is
located on level terrain in a grass-covered field, The earth overburden is
8 ft deep with bedrock below,

5.2.15 Capital Cost Estimate

The cost of the fuel processing plant was apportioned among three
principal categories: building costs, process equipment costs, and auxil-
iary process equipment and services costs. The building costs included
such items as site preparation, structural materials and labor, permanently
installed equipment, and material and labor for service facilities. Proc-
ess equipment costs were calculated for those tanks, vessels, furnaces, and
similar items whose primary function is directly concerned with process
operations. Process service facilities are items such as sampling facili-
ties, process piping and process instrumentation which are intimately asso-

ciated with process operations.

Accounting Procedure, — The accounting procedure set forth in the
Guide to Nuclear Power Cost Evaluation (52) was used as a guide in this
estimate, This handbook was written as a guide for cost-estimating reactor
plants, and the accounting breakdown is not specific for a chemical proc-
essing plant. Where necessary the accounting procedures of the handbook
were augmented,

Process Equipment. — A large number of process vessels and auxiliary
equipment in these plants is similar to equipment previously purchased by
ORNL for the fluoride volatility pilot plant for which cost records are
available, Extensive use was made of these records in computing material,
fabrication and over-all equipment costs, In some cases it was necessary
to extrapolate the data to obtain costs for larger vessels. Items that
were estimated in this manner include the fluorinators, furnaces, NaF
absorbers, and CRP traps. The cost of the UFg-to-UF, reduction unit was
based on a unit described by Murray (70). The unit had a larger capacity
than was needed for these plants, but it was assumed that the required
unit would have about the same over-all cost. Refrigeration equipment and
cold traps were estimated from cost data on ORGDP and ORNL equipment,

For vessels and tanks of conventional design, the cost was computed
from the cost of material (INOR-8 for most vessels) plus an estimated fab-
rication charge, both charges being based on the weight of the vessel, A
summary of values used in estimating process vessels by weight is given in
Table 5.1. Some items of process equipment were of special design and sig-
nificantly different from any vessels for which cost data were available.
For the shells of the prefluorination storage tanks, the high fabrication

cost values shown were obtained by comparison with an available shop esti~

mate for a similar vessel,

Auxiliary process items such as process piping, process electrical
service, instrumentation, sampling connections and their installation were
not considered in sufficient design detail to permit direct estimation. A
cost was assigned to these items which was based upon previous experience
in design and cost estimation of radiochemical processing plants. In
assigning these costs cognizance was taken of the fact that the plant is

remotely maintained.

Buildings. = The building estimate shown in Table 5.2 included the
cost of land acquisition, site preparation, concrete, structural steel,
painting, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, elevators, cranes,
service piping, laboratory and hot cell equipment, etc. The individual
costs were calculated using current data for materials and labor, and were
based on the drawings prepared.

Process Equipment Capital Cost. = Process equipment capital costs for
the two fluoride volatility plants are presented in Table 5.3. These costs
are the totals of material, fabrication and installation charges.

Building Capital Cost. — As mentioned above, process equipment and
buildings were the only items considered in sufficient design detail to
permit direct estimation. The remainder of the capital costs were esti-
mated by extrapolation from previous studies of radiochemical processing
plants. The fact that the plant is remotely maintained was an important
factor in estimating process instrumentation and electrical and sampling
connections. These items are expensive because of counterbalancing,
spacing, and accessibility requirements, |

Construction overhead fees were taken at 20 per cent of direct

materials and labor for all buildings, installed process equipment, piping,

Materials, utilities, maintenance materials, etc. were estimated by consid-
eration of the process steps involved; the estimates are listed in
Table 5.6 together with a summary of the labor cost. The total operating
cost was estimated to be $4,040,850 annually,

5.2.17 MSCR Irradiated Fuel Shipping Cost

The shipping cask must accommodate a molten-salt shipping cylinder

having a volume of 10 £2, The cost was estimated from the weight which

‘was determined by the shielding requirements. A unit cost of $1.00/1b

fabricated was allowed, including charges for an INOR liner and a condens-
ing-water radiator, - Three casks were allowed so that one might be at the
reactor site, a second at the processing plant, and a third in transit.

Results are listed in Table 5.7.

5.2.18 MSCR Unit Processing Cost

The various bases and contributions to the unit processing cost are
collected in Table 5.8 for the fluoride volatility central plant process-
ing of MSCR fuel. For the reference design fuel containing 32 kg of
thorium per £3, the unit cost was $36.90 per kg of thorium,

Although the cost was expressed in terms of $/kg of Th, it should be
remembered that only isotopes of uranium are recovered, Stripped salt,
containing valuable thorium, lithium-7, and beryllium, as well as fission
products, is discarded. Additional or alternate processing would be re-

: quired to recover any of these components,

5.3 Thorex Central Plant

 

The reference plant described in the Guide (52) is a central facility
capable of processing 1000 kg Th/day with thorium discard or 600 kg Th/day
with thorium recovery. The plant was designed specifically for thorium
metal or thorium oxide fuels; however, since other types of thorium fuels
were not specifically excluded, it was assumed that the plant would also
accept a fluoride-salt fuel, It was further assumed that the fluoride fuel
would be processed at the same base charge as the metal or oxide fuel.

This assumption amounted to assigning the same charge to a fluoride head-
end treatment as to dissolution and feed preparation steps for the other
fuels, The tail-end treatment for the conversion of Thorex nitrate product
to fluoride feed material was assigned a cost that was thought to be repre-

sentative of the processing steps.

5.3.1 Head-End Treatment

The head~end treatment shown schematically in Fig. 5.9 has not been
demonstrated, However, the chemical principles have been established (40)
by laboratory investigations of the stability of fluoride salt fuels.

It is known (40) that the oxides of uranium, thorium and beryllium are

very stable compounds having the indicated order of stability
UO, > BeO > Tho,

and that oxygen or oxygen-bearing compounds must be eliminated from fluo-
ride salt fuels to insure their stability. In the proposed head-end treat-
ment, the draw-off from the reactor at 500 - 550°C would be contacted in a
spray with steam or high temperature water (~200°C) to precipitate the
oxides of uranium, beryllium, thorium, protactinium and some of the fission
products. It is believed that rare earth oxides can be precipitated in
this manner. Lithium fluoride is a very stable compound and would probably
not enter into reaction with water, It should remain in the system as LiF
and be frozen into small crystalline particles.

The hydrolysis would form large quantities of HF which in aqueous
media is rather corrosive. Therefore the selection of materials of con-
struction for the precipator will be a problem. Disposal of HF can be
accomplished by dilution with large volumes of air and dispersion from a
stack or by neutralization with an inexpensive base. Some cleanup of the
HF stream will be required because of volatile fission products. Reuse of
this HF in the subsequent hydrofluorination step (see Fig. 5.8) may not be

~ feasible because of water vapor in the gas.

The second step in the head-end treatment is dissolution of all the
hydrolyzed components that are soluble in nitric acid, The oxides of
uranium, thorium, protactinium and rare earth products should dissolve
quite readily. Since lithium fluoride and beryllium oxide are quite in-
soluble in aqueous media, negligible amounts of these compounds should be

dissolved. Also, it is almost certain that some of the fission products

will be insoluble and remain with the lithium and beryllium. Dissolution

should proceed smoothly because it has been shown by Pitt (73) that the
particle sizes produced when a molten salt is sprayed into water are in the

micron and submicron range.

Dissolution is followed by solid-liquid separation either by filtra-
tion or centrifugation. Aqueous nitrate solutions are fed into a feed
adjustment step preceding solvent extraction by Thorex and the insoluble
material is routed to hydrofluorination. At this point a portion of the
solids can be discarded as a purge of fission products that remain in the

precipitate.

5.3.2 Solvent Extraction

Decontamination of thorium and uranium can be accomplished by well-
established Thorex procedures. Aqueous nitrate solutions are evaporated
until about 0,15 N acid deficient and fed to an extraction column. In the
extraction column both thorium and uranium are extracted into an organic

phase (tributyl phosphate) leaving the bulk of the fission products in the

"aqueous phase, with decontamination factors up to 10°,

Waste from the first extraction cycle contains all of the protactinium
that was in the feed stream. However, the amount is insufficient to war-
rant recycling the waste after an additional decay period. In the interim
between discharge from the reactor and chemical processing, the fuel ages
about 120 days so that only about 15% of the protactinium remains undecayed.
The waste is given permanent storage in large underground tanks.

In a fuel recycle system such as the MSCR it is not necessary to de-
contaminate further by the use of additional extraction cycles. The pres-
ence of 232 and 228Th will make recycle fuel too radioactive for direct
handling, regardless. After extraction, therefore, it is sufficient to
partition uranium and thorium in a stripping column by the proper adjust-
ment of organic and aqueous flow rates. In this operation, thorium is

stripped from the organic phase into an aqueous phase; uranium remains in

the organic phase. A subsequent stripping operation returns the uranium

to the aqueous phase. The produce streams are respectively Th(NOj), and
UO, (NOS),
5.3.3 Tail-End Treatment

Fuel reconstitution begins with acceptance of the nitrate products

from the solvent extraction plant. It is necessary to convert the nitrates

 

 

 
 

 

 

122

to the fluorides. In the case of thorium this is accomplished by pre-
paring the oxide in a denitration process followed by hydrofluorination in

a molten salt mixture. The steps are as follows:

steam denitration HF
TS —————" pm —————————EN
Th(NO,),, "400°C ® Th0, To soiten salt” Phy
(~v600°C)

Steam denitration is an established procedure in the sol-gel process
(33) for preparing highly fired, dense Tho, or Tho, - uo, fuel. In this
case the aqueous nitrate solution from the Thorex process would be evapo-
rated to crystallize Th(NO,), 3 the crystals in turn would be contacted with
superheated steam for the actual denitration. Final preparation of the
fluoride has to be accomplished in a second high temperature operation in
- molten fluoride salts, Thorium oxide is quite intractable to attack by
hydrogen fluoride under most conditions; however, in the presence of molten
fluorides the reaction will occur. The presence of other high valence com-
pounds, e.g., other thorium or uranium fluorides, in the melt abets the
dissolution,

The conversion of uranyl nitrate to the tetrafluoride is not as
straightforward as that of thorium because of the required valence change.
In the Excer process developed at ORNL, uranyl nitrate from the last Thorex
stripping column can be fed directly onto a cation exchange resin
(Dowex 50 W) which absorbs the uranyl ion. After loading, the resin is
eluted with aqueous hydrofluoric acid to produce UO,F,, which is reduced in
an electrolytic cell. The aqueous solution is allowed to flow into a
mercury cathode in which UF, * 0.75 H,0 precipitates from the aqueous
phase. The precipitate is separated by centrifugation or filtration and
dried. Water of hydration is not tenaciously held, and moderate drying
conditions are sufficient to expel it.

A second method of converting uo, (NO, ) to UF, is to reduce U(VI) to
U(IV) in the presence of fluoride at 500 - 600°C, In this tail-end treat-
ment the two nitrate solutions of thorium and uranium are mixed and co-
denitrated using superheated steam to yield Tho, and Uos. The mixed oxides
are converted to the fluorides in a 500 - 600°C molten fluoride salt bath

 
 

123

by contacting with a gaseous mixture of H, + HF, Uranium is reduced by
the hydrogen and hydrogen fluoride to the tetravalent form and dissolves
as UF; thorium is metathesized to ThE, which also dissolves in the melt,
The processing cycle is completed when the uranium fluoride is mixed
with fluorides of thorium, lithium, and beryllium oxide plus make-up feed
and hydrofluorinated. Beryllium recycled as BeO dissolves as Bef, when

hydrofluorinated in molten fluoride solutions,

5.3.4 Processing Costs

The unit processing costs were computed according to the prescription
given in Guide to Nuclear Power Cost Evaluation, Vol, 4, Section 460, The
escalated daily charge for operation of the Thorex plant was taken as
$17,500 in late 1962. Since the thorium was recycled, the capacity was
600 kg/day. As described in a previous section, the daily increments of
fuel withdrawn from the reactor were accumulated for 120 days and combined
into a single processing batch, If the withdrawal rate exceeded
1.25 £t3/day (40 kg Th/day), the batch size exceeded 4800 kg of Th and re=-
quired eight days or longer to process, For this range of process times,
the "turn-around-time" is specified to be eight days in the Guide, Thus .
the total processing time is 120r/600 + 8 days (where r is the withdrawal
rate in kg Th/day) and the total amount processed is 120r kg of Th. The

cost for operating the Thorex plant is thus

17,500 [$332 + 8]
120r

 

Separation Cost

(29.2 + 1167/r) $/kg Th

The cost of reducing solid fuel elements into a form suitable for pro-
cessing (aqueous solution of uranyl and thorium nitrates) is included in
the daily operating cost (104). It seems likely that the cost of convert-
ing the MSCR fuel by the method proposed in Sec. 5.2 would be less costly
than the reduction of solid fuel elements by Darex or Zircex. However, an

investment of $500,000 for MSCR fuel head-end treatment was allowed, based

 
 

 

 

124

on estimates extracted from reference 20, This resulted in a head-end
treatment charge of $0.53/kg Th processed.

The cost of converting recovered thorium nitrate to ThE, was not given
in the Guide. However, the cost of converting low enrichment uranium to
UF, was only $5.60/kg. Since the proposed thorium conversion process is
simpler and shorter than the uranium process, it seemed adequate and con-
servative to assign a cost of $5.00/kg Th for the conversion of ThE, .

Summing these charges, one has

Processing Plant Cost = (34.7 + 1167/r) $/kg

where r = kg Th/day removed from the reactor.

Shipping costs are presented in Section 465 of the Guide (52), and
include freight, handling, cask rental, and property insurance. The cost
is $16/kg of uranium (or thorium) for spent fuel elements.

MSCR fuel must be packaged before shipment. In the scheme proposed,
the daily productions of 1.67 £t3/day are accumulated in 35 £3 batches in
the spent fuel facility (Sec. 4.8.10) which contains 5 tanks each having a
capacity of 35 £3 and provided with sufficient cooling to remove afterheat
from freshly irradiated fuel. A 10 £t3 batch is drained into an INOR
"bottle" (cylinder) one foot in diameter and 13 feet long. This is in-
serted into an individual shipping cask and transported to the Thorex
plant. If the bottles cost as much as $10,000 apiece, but are re-usable
for at least 10 years, they will add to the shipping cost only $1.74%/kg Th
at the lowest rate of processing (40 kg/day).

The charge for shipping decontaminated thorium back to the plant is
represented to be $1.00/kg in the Guide.

Since the processing plant operating charge was all levied against
the thorium, the only charges on the uranium are shipping at $17/kg per
round trip and reconversion, for which operation the Handbook gives
$32/kg for converting the nitrate of highly enriched 2350 to UF. Although
the cost of conversion to UF, should be less, the given cost was assumed.
The total charge for the uranium was thus $u49/kg, and was charged against

all isotopes of uranium, including 238y and the precursor, 233pa,

5.4 Comparison of Processing Cost Estimates

For the purposes of comparison, the results of three other processing
cost studies are cited. The first, by Carter (20), dealt with a central
Fluoride Volatility plant designed especially for processing MSCR fuel at
a rate of 31.5 £t3/day (1000 kg Th/day). The estimates were based on the
same design study (21) used to prepare the estimates reported in Sec. 5.2.
The scaling, however, was performed on the plant as a whole, rather than
with individual items, and the scaling factor was 0.31, The estimated cap-
ital cost was $31.5 million, and the annual operating expense was $3.0
million. This study is referred to below as the "CMS" study.

The second study, also by Carter (20), dealt with a central Thorex
facility adapted to process fluoride fuels (1000 kg Th/day) and was based
on a detailed analysis of the head-end and tail-end processes (described
in the previous section) as well as the Thorex separation process, and
was based on an unpublished design and cost study performed by Carter,
Harrington, and Stockdale at ORNL in which flow sheets, equipment specifi-
cations, plant arrangement drawings, building drawings, etc, were prepared
and the items were costed. For brevity, this study is referred to below
as the "CHS" study. It is, essentially, an independent estimate of the
facility assumed in the Guide to Nuclear Power Cost Evaluation (52),
adapted for fluoride fuels. The estimated capital cost, scaled to a capac-
ity of 1000 kg Th/day, was $36. 5 million, and the annual operating expense
was $3.6 million. Co

~The third study, performed by W. H, Farrow, Jr. (32), dealt with sev-
eral radiochemical separation plants for several different solid fuels and
‘clads and with both direct and remote maintenance. The purex process, which
is similar to Thorex, was employed for the separations. The most applicable
case was that of a remotely maintained plant capable of treating one tonne
per day of natural uranium. ~ Although the process was described in consid-
erable detail, a cost breakdown was not given by Farrow. The capital cost
was $u3 million, and the annual direct operating cost was $3. 7 million. One
might reasonably assume that a Thorex plant of the same capacity would have
approximately the same costs, and that the head and tail-end treatments for
fluoride fuels would be no more expensive, and perhaps less, than those of
the solid fuels,

 
 

126

It is seen that the estimates of the total cost, including shipping,
vary by a factor of two, ranging from $37 to $75/kg of thorium processed.
It seems plausible that processing MSCR fuel’ in a central Fluoride Volatil-
ity facility will cost less than $50/kg, and possibly less than $40, and
that processing in a Thorex plant will cost less than $70, and possibly
less than $50 per kg of thorium.

6. FUEL CYCLE ANALYSIS
6.1 Analysis of Nuclear System

The nuclear calculations for the MSCR were performed by means of the
MERC-1 program for the IBM-7090, This program, described by Kerlin et al.,
in Appendix D, uses the multigroup neutron diffusion code Modric and the

isotope code ERC-10 as chain links.

6.1.1 Computer Programs

Modric, ~ This program was employed in a 34-group version using the
group energies and cross sections of the various elements given in refer-
ence Si, The cross sections were adopted for the most part from Nestor's
tabulation (72), with some minor modifications described below. Maxwell-
Boltzman averaged thermal cross sections and resonance integrals of impor-
tant materials are listed in Table 6.1. Thermal spectrum hardening was
ignored.

Although the treatment of downscattering in Modric provides for the
transfer of neutrons from any group into any of the ten next lower groups,
the required scattering matrices were not available when the MSCR calcula-
tions were begun, Subsequently, the matrices were computed taking into
account fast fissions and inelastic scattering in thorium and the fact that
the elastic scattering lethargy decrements were in some ranges larger than
the group widths, A single calculation was made to determine the impor-
tance of treating the downscattering in this more precise manner. The
effect was found to be insignificant.

ERC-10, — The basic isotope equation in ERC-10 computes the concentra-
tion that is in equilibrium with the sources (make-up, recycle, transmuta-

tion, decay, fission) and the sinks (transmutation, decay, waste, sales,

recycle). One isotope (usually 233y op 239%) may be selected to satisfy a

criticality equation; the feed rate or sales rate required to maintain the

‘critical concentration is then computed.

Three isotopes, 23", 236y, and 238y, approach equilibrium with

periods long compared to the assumed fuel life (30 years), The equilibrium

of their time-mean concentrations (starting with a reactor initially inven-
toried with 235y 95% enriched) were computed as described in Appendix H.
The transient behavior of all other isotopes, including 233pa, 233u,
and fission products, was ignored in the optimization studies, The approx-
mations involved in this approach are examined in Appendix Ho )
MERC-1, = Input (54) consists of specifications of the geometry and
dimensions of the reactor regions, initial guesses at the composition, in- a
formation on power, fuel volume, processing modes and rates, composition of oJ -

make-up materials, unit values, and processing costs. The output consists

 
 

 

129

of nuclear data (breeding ratio, mean eta, neutron balance, ete.), process-~
ing data (feed and production rates), and a fuel cycle cost (inventory,
make-up processing, etc.). An examination of these data discloses the
principal items of cost and suggests changes in specifications which might
reduce these. In some cases, the effect of changing an input parameter is
not readily predictable; e.g., increasing the concentration of thorium in
the fuel stream usually increases the conversion ratio and so reduces the
233) feed requirements but on the other hand increases the fissile inven-
tory. In cases such as this, the input parameters are varied systemati-
cally in a "factored" set of calculations yielding the maximum information
from a minimum number of cases. The fuel cycle cost is thus optimized

with respect to several variables simultaneously. (See Section 6.4.1.)

6.1.2 Reactor Physics Model

The reactor was computed as a homogeneous mixture in equivelant spher-
ical geometry (i.e., the input diameter was 1.09 times the diameter of the
cylindrical core). Thus the heterogeneity of the core, which is appreci-
able, was ignored. But this treatment is conservative in that the reso-
nance escape is underestimated, resulting in a pessimistic estimate of the
mean eta of the system. In regard to the estimated captures in thorium,
these can always be matched at some neighboring concentration. Aside from
a minor effect on the spectrum of neutrons, the chief error introduced is
a slight underestimate of the thorium inventory. But this is not important,
for the inventory charges contribute only a small portion of the total fuel
costs (less than 5%).

: The equivalent spherical core comprised three zones; an inner zone
consisting of a homogeneous mixture of fuel salt and graphite, a spherical
annulus about one inch thick filled with fuel salt, and a spherical reactor
vessel one inch thick. The mean, effective temperature of the fuel was
assumed to be 1200°F, and this temperature was also assigned to the graph-

ite, which, however, may run two or three hundred degrees warmer,

-dix A. Resonance saturation effects were ignored.
Beryllium, = The (n,2n) reaction of energetic neutrons in 9Be was ig- :
nored. It is of small importance in this graphite moderated reactor, and
is moreover offset by the disadvantageous (n,a) reaction which uses up a .
neutron and leads to the formation of SLi.
Fission Products. = These, excepting xenon and samarium, were handled
collectively in the Modric calculation and individually in the ERC calcu-
lation, as described below. An "effective" concentration of an "aggregate"
fission product was computed from ERC results and used in the multigroup
calculation in conjunction with an arbitrary set of group cross sections
composed of a hypothetical standard absorber having a thermal cross section
of one barn and an epithermal cross section corresponding to a 1/v varia-
tion above thermal.
Thermal cross sections and resonance integrals for fission products
were mostly taken from the compilation of Garrison and Roos (37), supple- -
mented by estimates from Bloemeke (9), Nephew (71), and Pattenden (80),
The data used, including fission yields and decay constants, are tabulated

in Appendix E.

6.2.1 Maximum Fuel Temperature

It is believed that the rate of corrosion of INOR will be very small
and that the heat exchangers will have a very long lifetime if the temper-
ature of the fuel solution does not exceed 1300°F (12). The maximum
allowable temperature may be higher; if so, future generations of molten-
salt reactors will be able to achieve higher specific powers and higher

thermal efficiencies,

6,2,2 Minimum Fuel Temperature

For this, 1100°F was selected. Earlier work (3) had shown this to be
a reasonable value, and calculations summarized in Table 6.2 confirmed its
optimal quality for the MSCR, Perturbations of the affected capital costs
were calculated in Table 6.2, and it was concluded that the optimum temper-

ature is very near 1100°F (see also Sec, 3.1.12).

6.2.3 Velocity

Erosion does not appear to be a problem in salt-INOR systems, nor does
there appear to be any dependence of the corrosion rate on velocity.
Rather, the velocity appears to be limited by considerations of pumping
power and stresses induced by pressure gradients. Pressure drop across the
heat exchangers is limited by the rapid increase in cost of INOR shells
with increasing wall thickness. Likewise, maximum allowable pressure drop
across the reactor core is determined by limitations on strength and thick-
ness of the reactor vessel and internal support members. Velocities, pres-

sures, and wall thicknesses at various points in the fuel circuit of the

‘reference design are listed in Table 6.3.

The pumping power required per heat exchanger loop was calculated to

be about 1500 horsepower; with a margin of 500 horsepower for pump and

motor inefficiencies and ‘unforeseen losses, This pumping power requirement

results in a pumping cost (with electric power at 4 mills/kwhr) of

0,004 mills/kwhre.

6.2.4 Fuel Volume

Contributions to the volume of the fuel system are listed in Table 4,1
for the reference design. The volume of fuel in the external system de-
pends on the power level and various limitations such as those on salt
temperature, pressure, velocity, thermal stress in and minimum thickness of
heat exchanger tubing, etc. The reference system was designed with consid-
erable conservatism. The fuel volume could be reduced appreciably with an
increase in specific power; pumping power costs and capital investment in
pumps would increase. Cost of heat exchangers might also increase. The
design of the system should be optimized with respect to the sum of all the
costs affected; but this lay outside the scope of the present study.

~The power density in the external portion of the fuel system of the
reference design is Zoproxinately 2.8 Mt /£t° . This is very much smaller

than the 7.6 Mwt/ ft used in a_prior study of a molten salt breeder (3)

which was based on a study by Spiewak and Parsly (99), who estimated a
specific power of 4,9 Mirt/£tS for a first generation plant and 7.6 Mwt/ ft

for subsequent plants.

 
 

134

Since only about one fourth of the total is contributed by the fuel
in the active core, the total fuel volume is not very sensitive to changes
in fuel volume. fraction in the core. The total volume is rather more sen-
sitive to changes in core diameter. The. volume of neutron-active fuel in-
creases as the cube of the core diameter (height equal to diameter), while
volume in the radial annulus and in top and bottom plenums increases as
the square. About 40% of the total volume is affected,

In a fully optimized system, the fuel volume might plausibly be
2000 £3, and perhaps be as low as 1800 £3, provided some of the holdup in

end-plenums, etc. can be eliminated.

6.3 Analysis of Chemical System

The composition of the fuel stream as a function of its chemical in-
teraction with the reactor environment and with the processing plant is
considered. Behavior of xenon-135 is important and is discussed in detail
in Section 6.8. Stagnation of fuel in crevices between moderator elements
may be important; however, it does not seem possible at this time to eval-
uate the effect except to say that parasitic captures of neutrons in
fission products immobilized in such places will take place. This uncer-
tainty was lumped with that associated with corrosion products as discussed
below, -

So far as the composition of the fuel stream is concerned, the chem-

ical effects of the two proposed processing methods (Thorex vs fluoride

volatility) are the same. The recycled uranium is radioactive and must be

handled at least semi-remotely whether the thorium is recycled or not.
Both methods result in recycle feed containing only negligible amounts of
nuclear poisons (other than isotopes of uranium) and both return 233pa
removed from the reactor as 233U with losses that depend only on the hold-

ing time prior to chemical treatment.

6.3.1 Thorium-232

~

Thorium may be recycled if Thorex processing is used; however, accord-

ing to the Guide, the capacity of a multi-purpose processing plant would be

 

 
 

 

 

 

~

135

reduced by 40% (52). (One could design the plant to handle the thorium
without loss of capacity, however, and recover the thorium at no extra
cost.) It turns out that this reduction in capacity almost exactly offsets
the value of the thorium saved. With the fluoride volatility processing,
thorium is not recovered except by means of an additional step presently

not available,

6.3.2 Protactinium-233

With mean residence times of the order of 1000 days, protactinium for
the most part decays while still in the circulating fuel system. However,
the process stream carries 60-80 grams per day out of the reactor system.
In the proposed reference design processing scheme (Section 5.2), the pro-
cessing stream is accumulated for 120 days and then held as a batch for an
additional 30 days, giving a total hold-up time of 150 days and an average
decay time of 90 days. At the time of processing, 85% of the 233pa in the
mixed batch will have decayed to 233U, so that the maximum loss of 233pa

will be only 9 to 12 grams per day.

The loss per pass through the processing plant was assumed to be 0.3%.
In the reference design reactor, the product stream from the process
plant was recycled to the reactor; however, the economics of sale of the

product stream was also examined.

6.3.4 Upanium-234

Natural uranium is 99,27 weight per cent 238y, 0.72 per cent 235U, and

0.0055 per cent 234, If there were no enrichment in 23% relative to

235y, a diffusion plant product containing 95 weight per cent 2350 would
also contain 0,726 per cent 23uy, with the balance being 238U, In order to
allow for some enrichment, the composition of the feed was taken to be 95
per cent 2350, 1.per cent 23%U, and 4 per cent 238U, As with 233U, the

processing losses were 0.3 per cent/pass.

Initially the reactor contains little 23%, The approach to equilib-

rium is slow, and, as seen in Appendix H, the average concentration over

 
 

136

a period of thirty years is only 65 per cent of the equilibrium concentra-
tion. The average value, rather than the equilibrium value, was therefore

used in the nuclear calculations,

6.3.5 Uranium=235

An enrichment of 95% was selected for the make-up. Losses in process-
ing were assumed to be 0.3% per pass.
6.3.6 Uranium=236 “

The concentration of this isotope also approaches equilibrium slowly
with respect to a fuel lifetime of 30 years. A concentration averaged over

the 30-year life was used. Losses in processing were assumed to be 0.3%,

6.3.7 Neptunium-237
This was assumed to be removed completely in the processing plant.
6.3.8 Uranium=238

For reasons given above, the fuel make-up stream was assumed to con-
tain 4% 2380 by weight. Losses in the process plant were assumed to be
0.3%. The 30-year average concentration was used in the nuclear calcula-

tions instead of the equilibrium concentration.

6.3.9 Neptunium-239 and Plutonium Isotopes

Only small amounts of these will be formed, and they are lost in the

waste. Accordingly, their formation in the fuel stream was ignored and no

breeding credit was taken for absorptions in 238y,
6,3,10 ‘Salt

~The fuel carrier in the reference design consisted of 68 mole per cent
LiF, 23 per cent BeF,, and 9 per cent ThF,, Lithium in the make-up salt
was 99,995% Li, Captures in Li, Be, and F were lumped under an equiva-
lent isotope "Carrier-1." The mean reactor concentration of 6Li and

Neutron captures therein were computed separately. Lithium and beryllium

in the process stream are lost to the waste, and no value was assigned to

 
a)

[3

 

 

 

 

137

the waste. The make-up rate was made equal to the discard rate for Li and

Be; the SLi feed rate was proportioned to the Li make-up rate.

6.3.11 Xenon-135 and Related Isotopes

In the reference design reactor, it was assumed the graphite has a

5 cm? /sec for

diffusion coefficient no greater than 107 em?/sec (D = 10°
MSRE graphite), a porosity no greater than 0.01, and that 10 per cent of
the fuel stream is recirculated to the dome of the expansion chamber and

the pump bowls. Here Xe is desorbed and swept away in a stream of helium

gas with an efficiency of 100 per cent per pass. With these assumptions,

the loss in breeding ratio due to absorptions in 135%e is 0.017 as shown
in Appendix G, where the losses corresponding to other assumptions are also

given,

6.3.12 Noble Metal Fission Products

It was assumed that this group of isotopes, comprising Mo, Rh, Ru, Pd,
and In, "plate out" on INOR surfaces in the fuel circuit with an efficiency

of 1.0 per cent per pass.

6.3.13 Other Fission Products

These are removed 100 per cent in the Fluoride Volatility process, and
only negligible amounts will be present in the recycle stream from a Thorex

plant.

6.3.14 Corrosion Products

Data are meager from which the concentration of corrosion products in
the circulating fuel stream could be estimated. In an in-pile loop oper-

ated for 15,000 hours, the concentrations of iron, nickel, and chromium

"appeared to fluctuate about equilibrium values (84, P. 79). On the basis

of these data one might expect the fuel to contain 50 ppm of nickel,

500 ppm of chromium, and about 250 ppm of iron. In the reference design

reactor., these concentrations would result in a poison fraction (loss in

breeding ratio) of 0,006 units, A poison fraction of 0,008 units was arbi-

trarily assigned to corrosion products in the calculations, making some

 
 

138

allowance for fission products immobilized in cracks and crevices in the

moderator, etc,

6.4 "Fuel Cycle Optimization

The designer has little control over some of the independent variables
that affect the fuel cycle cost. For instance, the maximum allowable fuel
temperature is fixed by necessity of limiting corrosion rates. For some
variables the fuel cost may decrease monotonically as the variable tends
toward an extreme value, but other costs may increase. For example, de-
creasipg the external volume of fuel salt decreases inventory charges but
increases pumping costs. A plausible and conservative external volume was
selected for the reference design optimization; however, effect on fuel
cycle cost of decreasing the external volume is easily estimated. .

After the values of such fixed or limiting variables were established,
there remained several which required optimization simultaneously with re-
spect to the fuel costs, These variables were designated the "key" |
variables. ]

The key independent variables were found to be the diameter (D) of the
core, the volume fraction (F) of fuel in the core, the concentration (M) of
thorium in the fuel salt, and the processing rate (R)., The second and
third combine to fix an important subsidiary variable, the C/Th atom ratio
(an indication of the degree of moderation of the system). Fixing all four
and then satisfying the criticality equation together with the equilibrium
isotope equation results in fixing the Th/U ratio, breeding ratio, fuel
cost, etc. |

Exploratory calculations showed that the fuel cycle cost is a rather
sensitive function of the C/Th ratio, but is insensitive to the diameter
of the core in the range from 15 to 20 feet. Relative breeding ratios and
fuel cycle costs for a series of calculations are shown in Table 6.4.

On the basis of these results, the 20-foot core having a fuel volume
- fraction of 10 per cent and using a fuel salt containing 9 mole per cent

ThE, was selected for further study. The optimum processing rate for this

combination of key variables was then determined from results listed in
Table 6.5.
The numbers given in Table 6.5 are plotted in Fig, 6.1. The fuel cost
has a minimum somewhat below 0.7 mills/kwhre at conversion ratios lying be-
tween 0.85 and 0.9. Slight changes in cost assumptions, etc. could shift
the location of this minimum over a wide range.
To the left of the cost minimum, loss of neutrons to fission products

increases burnup costs more rapidly than processing costs decline; to the

right the processing losses outweigh the gain in conversion. The extreme

in the conversion ratio results from the fact that processing losses in-

crease linearly with processing rate whereas loss of neutrons to fission

products decreases only inversely.

The processing costs used in computing Table 6.5 were those associated
with a central Fluoride Volatility Plant (Sec. 5.2) but followed, where
applicable, the prescription given in the Guide (52), The "turn-around"

time was 2 days for all of the cases listed.

“Reference Design Case

6.5 Reference Design Reactor

The MSCR is capable of producing power at a fuel cycle cost, including
salt charges, of 0.7 mills/kwhre at a conversion ratio of 0.9,

The most important uncertainties in this calculation arise in connec-
tion with (a) the behavior of xenon in the core, (b) costs estimated for

assigned to the materials and (d) cost of packaging the spent fuel for
shipment. The influence of xenon behavior is examined in Sec. 6.6, and the
cost assumptions in Sec. 6.7. "If the losses to xenon assumed for the
reference design case are attainable (and it should be possible to achieve
the assumed performance by improving the graphite and the sparging process),
then all the uncertainty resides in the processing cost. Since processing
costs are only about 0,08 mills/kwhre (Table 6.10), even a large error would

not significantly influence the total fuel cycle cost.

Uncertainties in regard to technical feasibility arise in connection
with compatibility and stability of the graphite moderator (Sec. 4.2.2), of
the reactor vessel and its internal structure (Sec. 4.2.2). Also, the

Ww hazards associated with the proposed methods of control (Sec. 4.2.3) have

6.5.2 Neutron Economy

From Table 6.7, it is seen that fissions in 232Th contribute very
little to neutron production. The fast fission cross sections of thorium
are appreciably less than those of 238y; moreover, the fast flux in the
MSCR is not particularly high (Table 6.6). Also, the thorium is rather
dilute compared to concentrations customarily proposed for blankets.

The nuclear loss resulting from absorptions in Pa is appreciable but
not serious. It could be reduced by reducing further the volume fraction
of fuel in the core, but this is already about as low (0.1) as seems tech-
nically feasible; a further decrease would probably add more to the fuel
cost in terms of increased inventory charges (since concentration of tho-
rium and uranium in the fuel stream would increase, while the external
volume would remain the same) than would be saved in terms of fuel replace-
ment costs. Increasing the external volume in order to dilute the Pa would
not be economical for the same reason.

The nuclear loss to Pa could be reduced by removing the Pa rapidly
from the circulating stream and holding it until it decays to 233, In
order to be effective, such a process would have to treat the entire fuel
stream for Pa removal in a period not greater than ten days (mean life of
Pa is about 40 days). Thus an extremely simple and efficient process is
required, as for example, the passage of the fuel stream through beds where
Pa is selectively absorbed and retained until 233y is formed, which then
desorbs in the presence of large amounts of uranium in solution. No such
process is presently known, although some work has been reported (19 p. 117,
74) on the precipitation of protactinium oxide from molten salt solutions
containing up to 2000 ppm of uranium by contacting the melt with BeO, Tho,),

the processing cycle (0.3% per pass). Since 23% is inferior with respect
to 233y as a nuclear fuel, it is advantageous to keep the concentration of
234% as low as possible. However, the designer has little control over
this, inasmuch as the only menas of removing it is to sell spent fuel to
the AEC, and this, as shown in Sec, 6.8.3, is not advantageous.

The concentration of 238U used was also averaged over a period of
thirty years, starting with a clean reactor containing no 236y, In this
case, the only source is capture of neutrons in 235g, the sinks are trans-
mutation to 237U (which decays promptly to 237Np) and losses (0.3% per
pass) in the processing cycle. The only effective control the designer has
over 236y is by varying the conversion ratio thus varying the amount of

It is assumed that 237xp was removed 100 per cent per pass through the
processing cycle. Parasitic captures are appreciable (0.0074 units on the
conversion ratio); however, special processing for this reason does not
appear to be worthwhile, although it might be for other reasons.

Parasitic captures in carrier salt resulted in a conversion loss of
0.039 units. Of this, captures in SLi contributed 0.014 units. The grade
of salt used (99,995% Li) appears to be about the best available at
attractive prices. On the other hand, use of inferior grades would not
result in lower fuel costs. .

The best way to control losses to SLi is to recycle carrier salt from
processing instead of discarding it as was assumed in the reference design.
The possibilities are examined in Sec. 6.8, where it is shown that about
0.01 units might plausibly be saved on the conversion ratio, and about
0,08 mills in replacement costs,

The fuel cost was optimized with respect to parasitic captures in
moderator and neutron leakage simultaneously as described in Sec, 6.4,
Losses to graphité might be decreased by decreasing the ¢/Th ratio, but the |
gain would be more than offset by losses in eta of 233y and increased
leakage. Leakage decreases slowly with increasing diameter, but fuel cost
is insensitive, as shown in Table 6.4. Efforts to reduce the leakage by
use of a graphite reflector were not successful (Appendix M), largely

because of the necessary presence of a fuel annulus at least one inch thick

of

-
at the periphery of the core as a result of tolerance allowance for dif-
ferential thermal expansion.

The estimate of the loss of neutrons to xenon (0.017 units on C.R.)
was based on an .assumed diffusion coefficient of 10~6 em?/sec., a porosity
accessible to gas of 1.0 per cent, and a sparging rate of 10 per cent
(16 f£t3/sec) of the circulating fuel stream with 100 per cent removal of
xenon per pass (Sec. 6.8.2). The prospects are good for the development of
grades of graphite that would reduce the losses to xenon in the MSCR to no
more than 0,005 units on the conversion ratio.

Captures in samarium (}49Sm and !51Sm) result in a loss of 0.013 units
in conversion ratio. This loss is independent of the processing rate ex-
cept at very short cycle times of the order of days. Thus, there is not
much prospect of reducing this loss except by the application of some
simple, rapid process similar to that suggested for 233p3 above.

Captures in other fission products can be controlled by varying the
processing rate. The savings from greater fuel conversion must be balanced
against increased processing cost. For the particular price structure and
nuclear properties assumed, the optimum rate of processing is “1.7 £t3/day
(53 kg of Th/day). The corresponding loss in conversion ratio due to
captures in other fission products is 0.074 units. In this calculation,
it was assumed that xenon is sparged as described above, noble metals are
reduced by chromium in metal structures to the zero valence state and
"plated out," and all other fission products are removed by passage through
the processing cycle which, at the costs estimated in Sec. 5.1, optimized -
at a cycle time of "1500 days.

If the processing cost schedule (Sec. 3,2 and 5.1) were to change in
the direction of lower costs, the optimum processing rate would increase,
and the fission product captures could be decreased. Although improve-
ments and economies in the Fluoride Volatility process are to be expected,
the remote operations and maintenance costs of this process are likely to
remain high; therefore the process eventually used should be as simple as
possible. The solution may lie in the direction of distillation or frac-
tional crystallization (80, p. 80), or perhaps extraction with liquid —

metals,

 
*”

 

 

 

147

The estimated loss in conversion ratio to corrosion products was 0.006
units; a loss of 0.008 units was allowed in the calculations (Sec. 6.3).
Since the concentration of corrosion products (Fe, Ni, and Cr) in the melt
appears to reach an equilibrium in times that are short compared to the
processing cycle time, it seems unlikely that the processing will have much
influence on the concentrations of corrosion products, and the associated

loss of neutrons seems unavoidable,

6.5.3 Inventories and Processing Rates

It may be inferred from Table 6.8, Column 1, that the specific power
of the MSCR is 0,35 Mwe/kg fissile, which is comparable with many of the
advanced systems currently being put forward. The exposure (about 40,000
Mwdt/tonne of thorium) is of the same order as that of "competitive"

reactors,

The processing rates given in Table 6.9 are the amounts removed
daily from the circulating fuel stream. These daily increments are accu-
mulated for 116 days to form a processing batch, The average fission pro-
duct activity in the material as processed corresponds to an effective
holding time of about 90 days (based on the Way-Wigner correlation as re-
ported in reference 55, p. 81). Thus, a process batch contains 6500 kg of
thorium; this is processed at the rate of 1000 kg/day for uranium recovery,

taking nT days to process and two days for "turn-around."

6.5.4 Fuel Cycle Cost

The fuel cycle cost for the reference design reactor, which is near
optimum on the bases chosen, comes to 0,68 mills /kwhre, A breakdown is
given in Table 6,10,

Inventory of fissile materials costs about 1/4 mills/kwhre, when
optimized with respect to the processing rate. It could possibly be re-
duced at a given processing rate by improving the graphite to reduce xenon
poisoning and by reducing the volume of fuel in the external heat transfer

circuit at the expense of greater pumping power costs.

#Cost bases are given in Sec. 3

Replacement costs for fissile material are most sensitive to conver=-
sion ratio. Increasing this from 0.90, as in the reference design reactor,
to 0.95 would cut the cost in half. The increase in conversion ratio might
be achieved by means discussed in Sec. 6.7.3.

The inventory charge for salt is strictly a function of the fuel salt
volume. The replacement cost depends on the processing rate, and was
optimized. A major improvement here would consist of adding equipment in
the processing plant for recovering lithium and beryllium,

The fuel cycle cost of 0,68 mills/kwhre estimated for the MSCR is con-
servatively based on the scale-up of proven technology (including the pro-
cessing) with the following minor exceptions:

1. Technology of reactor vessel design. |

2. Graphite technology.

‘3, Xenon sparging technology
These, however, are considered within the reach of current technology, i.e.,
no developmental break-throughs are required. )

Although difficult problems in gamma heating may be encountered in the

‘design of the reactor vessel and its internal members, it appears that

these can be solved. The problem in relation to graphite is to produce

 
 

 

150

pieces of the size required that are chemically compatible with fuel salt
and have porosity and permeability suitably :low with respect to xenon ab-
sorption (Sec. 6.8.2). oo

6.6 Parameter Studies

In this section, the effect on the fuel cycle cost of various assump-
tions concerning the processing cost, and of several modes of processing

are considered,

6.6.1 Processing Costas Parameter

The fuel cycle cost reported in Sec. 6.7 (Table 6.10) was based on the

assumed use of a central Fluoride Volatility facility requiring approxi-
mately $20 million in capital investment and having an annual operating ex-
pense of $2 million (Table 5.7). In Sec. 5.4, this estimate was compared
with other current estimates for similar plants and for Thorex plants of
comparable capacity. In this section, the processing plant capital invest-
ment and the operating cost are considered as parameters, without regard to
the kind of plant. The effect on the fuel cycle cost of the MSCR at
various processing rates of varying processing costs for a plant having a
nominal capacity of 1000 kg Th/day (30 £t3/day of reference design salt)
was calculated, In all cases, the output of the reactor was accumulated
until a processing batch of about 6000 kg of Th was collected; this was
then shipped to the processing plant and processed at a rate of 1000 kg
Th/day. The turn-around time was assumed to be 2 days.

The results of the calculation are presented in Fig. 6.2. The curves
corresponding to daily charges of $20,000 to $60,000, It is seen that, in
the conversion ratio range from 0.8 to 0.9, the fuel cycle cost is not very
sensitive to the processing cost; in the reference design, the fuel cycle
cost does not exceed 0.85 mills/kwhre at a daily charge of $40 thousand,
and only slightly exceeds 1.0 mills/kwhre for a charge of $60 thousand. At
$40 thousand, the minimum fuel cycle cost is less than 0.8 mills/kwhre at a
conversion ratio of about 0.85, and the cost remains below 1,0 mills/kwhre

for conversion ratios up to about 0.92.

It was concluded that, on any reasonable cost basis, the optimum fuel
cycle cost for the MSCR will not exceed 0.8 mills/kwhre, and that conver-
sion ratios up to 0.92 can be obtained at fuel cycle costs not exceeding
1.0 mills/kwhre.

6.6.2 Effect of Xenon Removal

The solubility of xenon in LiF-BeF, is very low (107); in the refer-
ence design reactor the equilibrium pressure is about 0.06 atmospheres.
Xenon thus tends to leave the salt at any phase boundary. It can be re-
moved rapidly by spraying a portion of the circulating stream into a space
filled with helium or by subsurface sparging. It may form microbubbles -
clinging to the surface of the graphite moderator, and it will tend to
diffuse into pores in the graphite; including pores inaccessible to the -
salt. Xenon is also removed from the system by decay to 135¢s and by
reaction with neutrons to form 136xe, which is stable and has a low neutron
capture cross section.
Xenon poisoning in the MSCR was calculated by the method of Watson and
Evans (107), as shown in Appendix G. The important physical properties are
the porosity, e, of the graphite (fraction of graphite volume accessible to
xenon) and the diffusivity of xenon, D (cm?/sec), The key variables are
the diameter of the graphite logs, the fuel circulation rate, and the
sparging fraction, r, (fraction of circulating stream sparged or sprayed to
removed xenon). In the reference design, the logs are six inches in diam-
eter, and the circulation rate is 160 £t3/sec,
In the reference design reactor, a gas-accessible porosity of 0.01 and
a diffusion coefficient of 107°

would result in a tolerable xenon poison fraction of 0.017 neutrons per

with a sparging fraction of 0.1 (16 £t3/sec), :

neutron absorbed by fissile atoms. These physical property values are an
order of magnitude smaller than those of currently available graphite where
e=0.1andD= 10"

able in small pieces of graphite (107) and the control of xenon poisoning

3 however, the assumed values are both presently attain-

in the MSCR appears to lie within the reach of developing technology.
The conversion ratio increases and the fuel cycle cost decreases with —

decreasing xenon poisoning. Table 6.11 compares the calculated results for \&/

Reference Design Reactor with eD = 1078 and ¥ = 0,1; (4d) "impermeable"

graphite with eD = 0 and r = 0.1.

It is seen that while available graphite (Case b) is not significantly
better than the "worst" graphite (Case a), nevertheless, the fuel cycle
cost is only 0.1 mill/kwhre higher than for "impermeable" graphite (Case d).
It is concluded that the fuel cost is not very sensitive to xenon poison-
ing, that it will be less than 0.8 mills/kwhre, with available graphite,

‘and that with modest improvements over available graphite (to e of 0.01 and

D of 10°%), the fuel cost will be not more than 0.7 mills/kwhre.

6.6.3 Effect of Product Sale Without Recycle

At least two benefits accrue from the sale of recovered fissile iso-
topes (as UF) to the AEC: (a) Make-up fuel (2350) would then be non-
radioactive and could be compounded with fresh salt in a directly main-
tained and operated facility; (b) the reactor would tend to be purged of
236y, The second benefit is really illusory, inasmuch as the 236U produced
will eventually capture a neutron in some reactor somewhere, and therefore
reduces the value of the recovered isotopes by an appropriate amount.

On the other hand, a penalty is incurred in that 233y, a superior fuel
in thermal reactors, is also lost from the system. As seen in Table.6.12,

the penalties outweigh the advantages considerably.

6.7 Alternative Design and Cost Bases

6.7.1 Thorex Processing Cost Estimates

The preferred method of processing MSCR fuel is by fluorination
(Sec. 5.2), mainly because the processing can conveniently be integrated
with the reactor and thus achieve very low fuel cycle costs, However, for
one reason or another, it may be desirable to process the spent fuel from
the first MSCR installations in a central Thorex facility. Accordingly,
the facility specified in the Guide to Nuclear Power Cost Evaluation (52,
104) was modified appropriately as described in Sec. 5.3 to handle MSCR
fuel. An allowance of $500,000 additional capital cost for the head-end
treatment was made, Costs were calculated on the bases given in the Guide.
The turn-around time was eight days and the shipping charge was $17/kg for
round trip. The assumed loss of fissile material was 1.3 per cent/pass.

The fuel cycle costs for the reference design reactor (Tables 6.6
through 6.10) were recomputed using a cost schedule estimated from the
Guide (52), as shown in Table 6.13, where they are compared to correspond-

ing results for central Floride Volatility processing (Sec. 5.2).

Thus, even though processed through the AEC reference plant, the costs
of which appear to be conservatively high, the fuel cycle cost for the ref-
erence design MSCR will not exceed 0,75 mills/kwh.

6.7.2 ‘Reactor-Integrated Fluoride Volatility Processing

Several advantages can be realized by integrating the processing with
reactor operations. The principal saving results from sharing reactor
shielding and remote maintenance equipment. Savings in laboratory facil-
ities and personnel are also- important. Shipping costs and associated re-
ceiving facilities are eliminated.

A 30 £3 /day central fluoride volatility plant requires a capital out-
lay of about $25 million and would need to service fifteen to twenty
1000 Mwe MSCR's in order to achieve the unit processing costs estimated in
Section 5,2, An integrated plant requires a much smaller investment and
the unit processing cost will be, of course, independent of the number of

reactors in use.
An integrated facility should be designed for continuous flow process-

ing, at least in the fluorinator and the UF, reduction reactor, in order

that the equipment and the volume of fuel-salt held up might both be small.

 
 

156

6.7.3 Reactor-Integrated Precipitation Process

At a processing rate of 1.7 £t3/day, the concentration of rare earth
fluorides in the fuel salt will be approximately 0.5 mole per cent, which
is perhaps slightly in excess of the solubility limit at the minimum fuel
temperature of 1100°F. This suggests that it may be possible to remove
rare earths fission products from the MSCR fuel stream by fractional crys-
tallization — an extremely attractive possibility, for such a process could
conveniently be carried out in the reactor cell and closely integrated with
the reactor system. The steps involved are exceedingly simple, involving
only the transfer of liquids and heat, and is therefore inherently safe and
economical,

The fission product neutron poisoning estimated for the reference de-
sign can be approximately matched by charging every day five cubic feet of
fuel salt containing 0.5 mole per cent rare earth thorides to a crystal-
lizer. The salt is cooled to S00°F, which is 13°F above the temperature at
which solid solutions containing Th or U separate. At this temperature,
the solubility of the rare earth fluorides is 0.2 mole per cent or less,
judging from the data of Ward et al., (108, 106). Thus about 60 per cent
of the rare earths will precipitate or "freeze" on the walls of the crys-
tallizer, The total mass of the solids will be only 6-8 kg. After the
fuel salt is returned to the reactor system, the fission products are dis-
solved in flush salt

The process described should effectively remove rare earths from the
fuel salt. It will not remove alkali metals, alkaline earths, and mis-

cellaneous other metals. These will accumulate in the fuel, but their in-

. growth can be partially compensated by operating the freeze-process at a

slightly more rapid rate and maintaining the rare earth concentration at
say 0.45 mole per cent or by discarding barren fuel-salt in a 1500 day
cycle ° )

6.8 Evolution of a Self-Sustaining MSCR

Although the MSCR concept may not have the capability of evolving into

a breeder reactor (see Sec. 7.1) having a doubling time less than 25 years,

a

157

the possibility exists, however, that it could, without increase in power
costs, achieve a net conversion ratio slightly greater than unity, and
thus become self-sustaining and independent of outside supplies of fissile
isotopes. Conditions under which this might be achieved are listed and

discussed below,

6.8.1 Reduction of Leakage

With the advent of separated 22Mo, it becomes feasible to surround the
core of the MSCR with a thin blanket of high-density thorium salt (25% ThF,,
75% LiF). This salt, having a liquidus temperature below 1100°F, could be
circulated slowly through 6-inch diameter molybdenum tubes replacing the
outer two layers of graphite moderator logs, and replacing 1l-ft end sec-
tions of the central logs. The isotope 92M0 is a magic nuclide, having a
2200 m/s cross section of 6 millibarns. The epithermal cross section is
currently being measured at ORNL, and preliminary results indicate that the
resonance integral is also very small. Thus, structural molybdenum should
capture only a negligible fraction of neutrons.

It would be necessary to remove the bred 233y papidly from the fertile
stream for two reasons: (a) fissions in the fertile stream would tend to
increase the leakage, (b) fission products in the fertile stream would
capture neutrons. If the fertile stream were processed rapidly by fluori-
nation, the concentration of 233U could be kept very low, fissions would be
suppressed, the inventory charge for 233y would be largely avoided. The
fertile stream carrier salt could be recycled without further treatment.
The rapidity of the processing, however, implies the use of an on-site,
reactor-integrated facility such as that described in Sec. 6.9.2. oo

By this means perhaps half the leakage neutrons could be saved, adding

about 0,025 units to the conversion ratio.

6.8.2 Reduction of Xenon Captures

In the reference design, graphite properties an order of magnitude
better than those characteristic of current graphites were assumed, result-
ing in a loss in conversion ratio due to captures in 135%e absorbed in the
graphite of only 0.017 units. By further improvements (e.g., by spraying a

thin coating of 32M6 on the moderator logs and carburizing to prevent xenon

 
 

 

 

158 —

from penetrating the moderator) perhaps another 0.01 units on the con-
version ratio could be saved.

6.8.3 Reduction of Fission Product Poisoning

Somewhat over 0,085 units were lost from the conversion ratio as a
result of captures in fission products in the reference design (Table 6.7).
The processing cost in a central Fluoride Volatility facility was about
0.08 mills/kwhr, If an on-site, reactor-integrated Fluoride Volatility and
HF-Solution facility were used (Sec. 2.2.14), the rate of removal of rare
earths could be increased perhaps by a factor of 10. Solubles (Cs, Ba,
etc.) could be purged by discarding salt in a 1500 day cycle, as in the .
reference design. If this were done, the loss of conversion ratio to

fission products could be reduced to about 0,010 units, -

6.8.4 Improvement of Mean Eta and Reduction of 236y Captures

Other than by varying the C/Th ratio, the designer has no direct con-
trol over these, Nevertheless, the above improvements in neutron economy
have an effect on the conversion ratio that is greater than their cumula-
tive sum, for 233U is superior to 235 in respect to neutron production,
and moreover yields a fertile isotope (23%) upon capture of a neutron.

An increase in relative concentration of 233U by any means increases the
number of neutrons available for breeding, and reduction of 235U feed rate
results in a decrease in 236U concentration.

The above listed improvements should result in an increase in eta of .
0.01 units and a reduction of captures in 2360 by 0.01 units, at least.

6.8.5 Ultimate Breeding Potential of MSCR

The conversion ratio in the reference design is about 0,90, With the
improvements listed above, conversions slightly in excess of 1.0 may be .
achieved, as shown in Table 6.14, a fein

Thus, the MSCR may be capable of evolving stepwise into an economical,
self-sustaining breeder reactor with fuel cycle costs probably in the range
of 0,7 - 1.0 mills/kwhre, | | CC -

It should be emphasized that the limiting conversion ratio estimated \&/
for the MSCR does not apply to molten salt breeder reactors. It has been .

shown (3) that two-region, two-fluid, thermal reactors optimized with.
respect to breeding are capable of achieving doubling times of 25 years or
less. (See also Sec. 1.7.) In addition, the advent of structural I2y,
makes possible, in principle, the design of two-region, two-fluid, fast
molten-salt reactors which may have doubling times as short as ten years,
which will not need to use separated ®Li in the “carrier salt, and which

therefore may be processed economically by fluorination only.

7.4% MSCR Operating and Maintenance Cost Estimate

The MSCR is a single reactor, single turbine plant, and, although its
power generation capacity is high, its manpower requirements are relatively
low because of the single unit operation, Plant personnel totals 101 with
a cost of $872,000 per year, Materials cost $220,000, Maintenance, in-
cluding provision for periodic equipment overhaul, special services pro-
vided by off-site personnel and organizations, totals $800,000. With an
allowance of 14 percent for central office expense, the total cost is
$2,154,000 or 0,30 m/kwh. "The Guide to Nuclear Power Cost Evaluation (52)
criteria were followed where applicable in determining plant organization.

7.4.1 Labor and Materials

:

The manpower requirements of the 1000-Mwe MSCR plant are shown in
Table 7.4 for operations and general supervision. Routine operation of the
plant may require fewer people, particularly on the technical staff. Re-
view of reactor plant personnel requirements developed by Sargent and Lundy
(94), and Kaiser Engineers (51) for 300 Mwe (net) plants are compared in
Table 7.4 for single unit systems.

In practice, the actual distribution of manpower may shift, but the
total labor cost should remain approximately as shown. For example, one
storekeeper may be insufficient, in which case an engineering assistant or
maintenance mechanic helper might be replaced by a stores clerk.

In general, the turbine room operation includes, in addition to the
turbo-generator proper, (a) water supply and disposal systems, e.g., sani-
tary service, treated and circulating water systems, (b) boiler feed
systems which include boiler feed pumps, steam circulators, and Loeffler
boilers, and (c) the turbine auxiliaries, e. gos lubricating oil systems,
liquid and gas coolant systems, and instrument and compressed air systems,
The reactor operation includes (a) salt charging systems, (b) salt with-
drawal systems, (c) salt shipping facilities, (d) liquid and gaseous waste
disposal systems, and (e) pressurized gas supply and treatment systems.
These facilities are staffed on a semi-automated basis; for fully automated

operation, the manpower requirements would be less,

7.4.2, Operation and Maintenance Cost

The estimate of $2,154,000 shown in Table 7.5 does not take into
account any unforeseen difficulties and expenses that may be encountered
in the MSCR. It may well be that requirements for personnel and equipment
for maintaining a radioactive molten salt system are greater than estimated
- possibly by as much as a factor of three. This cannot be accurately
determined until maintenance procedures have been more clearly defined and
the reactor plant designed in greater detail than was possible in the
present study.

Based on 1038 Mwe net and a plant factor of 0.8, the contribution to
the power cost is 0.3 mills/kwhre.

8. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS

The cost of electric power is commonly resolved into three components:

The fuel cost, the fixed charges, and operation and maintenance expense.

8.1 Fuel Cost

As shown in Sec. 6, the fuel cycle cost in the MSCR ranges from
2 mills/kwhr (electrical) down to 0.7 depending on the conversion ratio
desired and the method and/or cost of processing assumed. For present pur-
poses, the minimum cost associated with the reference design reactor summa-
rized in Table 6.6 was selected as representative. This reactor is "near-
term" and predicated on the scale-up of current technology with the ex-
ception of the moderator graphite, which was an order of magnitude better
than currently available graphite in respect to porosity and permeability.
The fuel cycle cost, using Fluoride Volatility processing in a central
plant with discard of carrier salt and contained thorium and recycle of

isotopes of uranium, was reported in Sec. 6.7.1.

8.2 Fixed Charges

The capital investment for the 1000 Mwe (1038 Mwe net) station was
estimated by Sargent and Lundy, Engineers from information supplied by
ORNL, as reported in Sec. 7, and summarized in Table 7.1. The investment
comprised $137,564,000 for depreciating capital items, and $11,311,800 for
non-depreciating items (coolant salt and land). Fuel salt fixed charges
are included in fuel cycle cost.

Working capital was estimated according to the prescription given in
the Guide (52), and is shown in Table 8.2.

1. 2.7% of annual operating labor and fuel costs: $ 200,000

2, 25% of annual maintenance and materials: 250,000

Total Working Capital. $ 450,000

 

Similarly, the nuclear hazard insurance premium was estimated by
prescription at $340,000 per year. The fixed charges are collected in
Table 8.3.

8.3 Operation and Maintenance Expense
This expense was estimated in Sec, 7.2 and amounted to $2,154,000 per
year, of which $1,020,000 was for maintenance and materials and the rest

was for labor, supervision, and management. At 1038 Mwe net, the contri-
bution to the power cost is 0.3 mills/kwhr (electrical).

8.4 Cost of Power

The three components of the power cost are assembled in Table 8.4,

Table 8.4. Cost of Power in a 1000 Mwe Molten Salt
Converter Reactor :

 

Item Mills/Kwhr

 

Fuel cycle cost

Fixed charges 3.0
Operation and maintenance 0.3
Cost of power, mills/Kwhr 4.0

 

In regard to the fuel cycle cost, it was shown in Sec. 6.8 that this
would not exceed 1.0 mill/kwhr even though the fuel were processed in a
1.0 tonne/day Thorex plant costing up to $60 thousand per day to operate.
Such a general purpose plant could provide processing of fuel from thorium
reactors having a total power capability of about 20,000 Mwe at an exposure
of 50,000 Mwd/tonne,

The energy conversion system, accessory electrical equipment, and
miscellaneous plant equipment (Items 23, 24, and 25 in Table 7.1) are con-
ventional items, and the estimation of their cost appears to be relatively
unambiguous. Items 21 and 22 are perhaps subject to considerable uncer-
tainty. But their total is only about $57 million, whereas the contingency a

item is $11 million. However, the possibility exists that Item 21 was

 
 

 

*

e)

171

grossly underestimated, or that the effect of radiation shielding require-
ments on building costs was underestimated. Supposing Item 21 to be

$18 million (factor of 3), and allowing another $5 million for the reactor
plant (10%), the investment comes to $166/kw, and the fixed charges to

3,5 mills/kwhr, as an upper limit,

Provision for labor in Sec. 7.2 seems adequate. Materials and supplies
accounted for about half the operation and maintenance costs; if this were
doubled, the contribution to the cost of power would be about 0.5 mills/kwhr,

Collecting these probable upper limits on the cost of power in the
MSCR, the sum is 5.0 mills/kwhr,

8,5 ‘Breeding Potential of the MSCR

The nuclear capability of the reference design MSCR is summarized in
Fig. 8.1. With central Fluoride Volatility processing, the minimum fuel
cycle cost is about 0.7 mill/kwhr and the conversion ratio about 0.9 at a

processing cycle time of 1500 days. Increasing the rate increases the con-

~ version ratio to perhaps as high as 0,93, but the fuel cost rises steeply.

The use of an on-site reactor-integrated (inside the reactor cell)
Fluoride Volatility facility would increase the fuel cost by only 0.1
mill/kwhr in the 1000 Mwe station, |

The use of an on-site reactor-integrated precipitation process for
removing rare earths might reduce the fuel cost below 0.5 mills/kwhr,

By taking advantage of potential improvements in neutron economy (but
retaining the essential features of the MSCR) an upper limit on the con-
version ratio of 1,03 was estimated. This was interpreted to mean that
the MSCR is capable of evolving into a self-sustaining reactor requiring
only thorium feed. Outside source of fissile isotopes would not be needed.

This limitation does not apply to two-region breeders, which were

-shown previously to be capable of doubling times as short as 25 years. (1).

8.6 ‘Conclusions

The 1000 Mwe MSCR requires a capital investment of $1u3/kwhr. The
fixed charges are 3.0 mills/kwhr, the fuel cost is 0.7 mills/kwhr, the
maintenance and operation expense of 0,3 mills/kwhr, and the net power cost
is 4,0 mills/kwhr,

Substitution of sodium for LiF-BeT, as the intermediate coolant and
replacement of the Loeffler boiler-superheater complex with a more con-
ventional sodium-heated boiler would reduce the capital investment to about
$125/kwhr. Development of alternative methods of processing (e.g., preci-
pitation of rare earth fluorides) provides potential for reducing fuel
cycle cost. An examination of the neutron economy indicates that the MSCR
should be capable of evolving into a self-sustaining breeder reactor

(BR 1,0) not dependent on outside sources of fissile isotopes.

8,7 "Recommendations

The comprehensive program of research and development for molten salt
reactors in progress at ORNL is concerned at present with the construction
and operation of the MSRE. This MSCR evaluation has disclosed certain
additional areas of study, research, and development important to the
realization of the nuclear and economic potential of molten salt reactors.
These areas are listed below, together with specific examples in each area.

8.7.1 Title 1 Design Study of MSCR

This should be performed for two plant capacities (100 and 1000 Mwe)
in order to detect unrecognized development problems and to verify the
economic predictions made in this report. The study preferably should be
conducted by an organization outside the Laboratory, but with close liason
and cooperation in special studies (e.g., nuclear design, reactor-integrated
chemical processing). A study of 100 Mwe installation is desirable to
bridge the gap between the MSRE (10 Mwt) and a full-scale prototype.

 
 

174

8.7.2 Conceptual Design Studies of ‘Advanced Breeder Reactors

Prior studies have established the nuclear potential of a thermal
molten salt-thorium breeder, However, this concept should be re-examined
and developed in greater detail in the light of the technology accumulated
in recent years. In addition, the potential of fast molten-salt breeders,
including those breeding plutonium, or possibly both plutonium and 233y,
should be evaluated. A number of concepts have been proposed, and it is
not clear, at present, which of these offers the greatest ultimate poten-

tial coupled with the least difficulty of development.

8.7.3 Fundamental Studies of Alternative Chemical Processes

While the fluoride volatility process is suitable for the recovery of
isotopes of uranium from short-cooled fuel, its use alone does entail the
discard of the carrier salt to rid the system fission products. This fact
limits the processing rate and conversion ratio in thermal reactors using
valuable isotopes of lithium and beryllium, although fast reactors using
fluorides of sodium and potassium, etc., are not so limited. For the
thermal reactors at least, an alternative process is needed in which sepa-
ration of valuable components (thorium, uranium, lithium, beryllium) from

fission product isotopes is effected by transfer between fluid phases,
e.g., by extraction of molten salt fuel with a liquid metal. Driving
forces for the transfer can be provided by the use of active metals and
easily reduced fluorides or perhaps by the application of electric

potentials,
8.7.4 Engineering ‘Laboratory Study ‘of Precipitation Processing

This process, which has great potential for reducing the fuel cycle
cost in the MSCR and which, by necessity, must be integrated with the
operation of the reactor and placed within the reactor cell, could make
‘the introduction of MSCR power reactor plants independent of the availa-
bility of central processing facilities for molten salts. This is an
enormous advantage for the initial installations, particularly if these

are widely scattered in remote locations. Also, the competitive position

of the smaller installations (100 Mwe) would be improved.

8.7.5 Pilot Plant Study of HF Dissolution Process

This process, though not essential to the realization of the economic
potential of the MSCR would, if developed, make possible the evolution of
the MSCR into a self-sustaining system, and would constitute a large step

in the development of two-region, two-fluid breeders,

EFFECTIVE THORIUM RESONANCE -INTEGRALS

J. W. Miller*

The "effective" resonance integral to lethargy u of a particular

isotope in a mixture of isotopes is defined by the equation

.
I (eff) -/ : (900 )ers du

The value of (o,, is a complex function of a number of variables.

oles
A most important item is the scattering power of the medium, measured by
On? macroscopic scattering cross section per thorium atom,
o, = % N oL/No .

The greater the scattering power, the greater the probability that a
neutron will be slowed through a resonance without absorption. The thermal
motion of absorber nuclei, on the other hand, increases the probability of
absorption due to Doppler broadening of the resonances. This effect is
small at 20°C, the standard temperature for reporting measured values, but
increases at higher temperatures. Dresner has developed a method for com-
puting the temperature effect for resolved resonances. t

Group averaged cross sections for thorium are related to the effective
resonance integral and were calculated by means of the equation
uy + Aa,

(0g )ese du ,

where i is the group number.

 

¥Adapted from ORNL-CF 61-1-26.

Analysis

By assuming a Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution for the moderating
medium and the Breit-Wigner formula for a single resonance, Dresner? has

arrived at the following equation for the resonance integral, I for a

eff?
single absorption resonance:

™

Other terms are defined in the nomenclature.

The function J(&,k) is tabulated in ref. 1. The tabulated results
have been plotted as the family of curves in Fig. B.l.

The reduced mass of the neutron p is equal to neutron mass (~1.0)
multiplied by M/(M+l), where M is the mass of the absorbing atoms. Since
the mass of thorium is 232, u was taken as unity for these calculations.

Table B.1l lists the resonance parameters for—-each of .the 13 resolved
thorium resonances (2). These parameters were used in the equation for
Ire for computing the resonance integral for each resonance. (since these
calculations were performed, additional thorium resonances have been re-
solved, and improved parameter values for previously resolved resonances
have been obtained. The effect of these new values has not been evaluated.)
The total resonance integral for each energy group is then obtained. by ad-

ding together the separate integrals for each resonance. Table B.1l also

Sample Calculation

Example: Compute the effective resonance integral (Tepe) for the
thorium resonance at 23.6 ev with a carbon-to-thorium ratio of 200 and an
absorber temperature of 649°C. The nonresonance scattering cross section,
0’, of carbon is 4.8 barns, and the thorium nonresonance scattering cross

Results

The MERC-1 program used in the MSCR study is a 34-group diffusion-
theory code. The group structure is such that the resolved resonances of
thorium fall into five groups: 11, 12, 15, 16, and 22. The group-averaged
absorption cross section for each of these five groups as a function of %
at 649°C is plotted in Fig. B-2. The total resolved resonance integral is
plotted in Fig. B-3 for three reactor temperatures.

ENERGY DEPENDENCE OF ETA OF ?33yx

C. W. Nestor

Summary

A parameter of great interest in nuclear calculations of a thorium
reactor is 7m, the number of neutrons produced per neutron absorbed. Ex-
perimental information on the energy dependence of 1 in the range of 0
- to 10 ev as measured at the MIR was used to calculate group averaged fis-
sion cross sections, using absorption cross sections calculated from the
: recent total cross section data'’? and the scattering cross section as
calculated by Vogt.! The n values used in preparation of the cross sec-
tions was normalized to a 2200 m/sec value of 2.29.3
In the energy range of O to 0.8 ev, 1 was assumed to be constant at
2.29. In the range of 0.8 ev to 10 ev, as mentioned, group averaged

values of Vo, = no, were calculated by numerical evaluation of the inte-

where Au denotes the lethargy width of the group.

In the range of 10 ev to 30 ev n was estimated to be 2.17; the data
of Gaerttner and Yeater* indicate an average 7 in this range of about
0.95 times the 2200 m/sec value.

From 30 ev to 30 kev, 1 was assumed to be 2.25; this is the value
reported by Spivak® et al., at 30 kev.

From 20 kev to 900 kev, measurements of 7 are available;? fission
cross sections are reported in BNL-325 for the range 30 kev to 10 Mev.
The total cross section in this range was taken to be equal to that of
235y, as suggested by J. A. Harvey.! The value of Vv was assumed to be
linear in energy with a 2200 m/sec value of 2.50 (ref. 3) and a slope of
0.127 per Mev.® A plot of the experimental n and the group averaged
values from 0.01 ev to 1 kev is shown in Fig. C.1l. Group values are also
listed in Table A.l of Appendix A.

THE MERC-1 EQUILIBRIUM REACTOR CODE

T. W. Kerlin
Introduction

The MERC-1 code automatically calculates the composition of a fluid-
fuel reactor so that equilibrium and criticality conditions are simul-
taneously satisfied. MERC-1 uses the MODRIC' multigroup-diffusion-theory
code and the ERC-10 equilibrium reactor code as chain links. These codes
were previously used separately at ORNL in iterative calculations to de-
termine equilibrium reactor compositions. MODRIC was developed by the
Central Data Processing Group at the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant as
a replacement for GNU.? The ERC-10 code was prepared as a later version
of ERC-5.2 The MERC-1. code automatically transmits necessary data from
one chain link to the other until sufficient iterations have been performed
to cause criticality and equilibrium requirements to be satisfied simul-
taneously. The output consists of equilibrium concentrations, a neutron
balance, and fuel-cycle costs.

The system which is considered in the MERC-1 analysis is shown in
Fig. D.1. A complete specification of data required for controlling the
flow and losses in each stream is included in the MERC-1 input. Note in
Fig. D.1l that material is removed from the reactor system by losses, waste,
and sale as well as by nuclear transformation (decay and neutron absorp-
tion), and that fresh material is fed to the system. Therefore, the cal-
culated equilibrium concentrations are in equilibrium with respect to the
feed and discharge rates as well as with respect to nuclear transformation

rates.
Theory

MODRIC is a typical neutron-diffusion-theory code. It allows 50

neutron energy groups with downscattering from a group to any of the

following ten groups. It will perform concentration searches on specified
elements. The output consists of criticality search converged concentra-
tions, group macroscopic cross sections, normalized nuclear events (ab-
sorptions, fission,leakage, etc.) by region and group, absorptions and.
fissions by material and region, group flux distributions, and fission
density distributions.

ERC-10 requires extensive input. Rewriting of large quantities of
input is avoided by using basic input decks which include information ap-
plicable to a number of cases. To specify a new case, it is necessary
only to specify changes in the basic input deck. For instance, one might
prepare a basic input deck for a particular reactor with a given power
level. A set of cases with different power levels would need only the
basic input deck and the new power level as input.

Basically, ERC solves two equations. They are:

dn, . f
Vv. —xd = ... +R + F + T + D
J > 9 3 iJ iJ ij ij

-N,. (t,, +d,,+q,,—-7r,.)=0, (1)

or if the material must be fed to maintain criticality

Equation (2) is just the conservation requirement, saying that enough fis-

 sile material must be added (or removed) im iteration “sto overcome the
neutron production deficiency (or excess) in iteration (s-1). These are

Cinner iterations in ERC. The terms are defined as:

vy = volume of stream j, cm’,
Ny 4 = atoms of material i per barn cm of stream J,
t = time, sec,

Qy = feed rate of material i into stream Jj, atoms/sec,

Rs = rate of growth of material i in stream J due to recycle: from

15k = reaction rate coefficient, number of absorptions in material
i per atom/barn cm in stream j in region k per fission neutron
born in reactor.
Superscripts:
i = material,
J = strean,
= region.

The use of stream and region indexes allows reactors with two streams in
the same region to be analyzed. ~

The equilibrium concentration calculations in ERC use reaction rate
coefficients (C, 13x) obtained from an earlier MODRIC calculation. However,
the initial concentrations used in the MODRIC calculation will not, in
general, agree with the equilibrium concentrations computed by ERC. This
new set of concentrations will alter the neutron spectrum and flux level,
thereby changing the reaction rate coefficients. Therefore, it is neces-
sary to repeat the MODRIC criticality calculation with the latest value

for the estimated concentrations to-get new reaction rate coefficients.

 
i 213
~0
This process is repeated until the MODRIC and ERC concentrations are equal.
The flow of information in the code is shown in Fig. D.2.
The reaction rate coefficients (C) 3x) used in ERC are spectrum-averaged

cross sections which are available directly from MODRIC. The MODRIC cal-

 

culation gives Asp and VF,» the absorptions and neutron productions in
material i in region k, normalized to 1.0 total neutron produced. The
distribution of nuclear events between two streams in a region is accom-

plished by introducing the stream volume fractions, fix in this manner:

 

 

 

A =A -(ehome of i in stream j in region kj .
ijk = ik atoms of i in region k ’
F = V.F - [atoms of i in stream Jj in region kj.

The material, stream, and region dependent absorption and production terms
are automatically transferred from the MODRIC link to the ERC link of the
MERC-1 calculation. ERC obtains the reattion rate coefficients (intensive

quantities) from the absorption and production terms (extensive quantities)

 

by dividing by N50 the stream concentration

A similar argument applies for the fission reaction rate.

The restriction to fluid-fuel reactors occurs because the ERC calcu-
lation requires that the reactor discharge composition be equal to the
mean reactor composition. This restriction is satisfied in fluid-fuel re-
actors but not in solid-fuel reactors where the discharge has experienced
a much greater exposure than the mean.

In ERC-10, effective, one-group cross sections of individual fission
products were calculated by reference to a standard absorber exposed to
the MSCR spectrum of neutrons as generated by the multigroup program Modric.
The thermal cross section and the resonance integral can be used in a two-

group model to calculate relative one-group cross sections. Thus, set

The spectral index, K, is computed by Modric from input data. The reference
element was the standard absorber referred to above. The product of the
reference element cross section and the effective flux integrated over the
core is computed from Modric output by dividing the fraction of neutrons

as absorbed by the reference element by its atomic density, N. This
product is the desired number for use in the ERC calculations; the working

equation becomes

The thermal cross sections o, are computed from the 2200 m/s cross

sections by multiplying by a factor that averages them over a Maxwell-
Boltzman spectrum around the reactor temperature. This factor was computed
for a 1/v energy dependence of the cross section and applied uniformly to
all fission product isotopes, except noble gases.

In all, 115 fission product isotopes were so treated, linked by trans-
mutation and decay into chains. Provision was made in ERC-11 to remove
each at a rate determined by its chemical or physical properties in rela-
tion to the processing method. For instance, xenon is removed repidly by
transpiration in an expansion: chamber, whereas rare earths are removed
only by discard of the fuel salt with ga, period measured in hundreds of days.

Xenon was treated separately in the Modric calculation, not only to
determine accurately its effective cross section in the MSCR neutron spec-
trum but also to permit special treatment of its exceptional behavior. It
may be possible to remove xenon rapidly from the fuel solution by circulat-
ing a portion of the salt through the dome of the expansion tank mounted
over the core (Sec. 4.2.2) provided the xenon does not diffuse rapidly
into the moderator graphi te. Provision was made in ERC-11 to calculate
the extreme cases (complete absorption in graphite vs. zero absorption) as

well as intermediate situations where removal competes with absorption.

 
 

218

Samarium was also treated separately because of its importance.

The fission product calculation is thought to result in a reasonably
good approximation of the poisoning in reactors where the fission products
are exposed to neutrons for a long time. The ingrowth of second and higher
generation isotopes by transmutation and decay is treated in detail. The
transient period following start-up of a clean reactor with an initial
loading of 2357 is ignored, and all concentrations are calculated at their
maximum, equilibrium values. Hence, the poisoning is overestimated some-
what, thus providing a margin of safety in respect to assignment of the
cross sections and resonance integrals. oo

The value of Cf must be specified if fission product option 1 is specified
on card BN=5. This value should be calculated using an estimated value

for K. If fission product option 2 is specified on card BN-5, is cal-
culated by the code using the latest value of K. The required values of
02200 and RI for a special reference material are built into the code for
fission product option 2. The nuclear constants for a 1l/v absorber with

a 2200 m/s cross section of 1.0 barns are built into the code. Therefore,
to use fission product option 2, the reference element must correspond to
an artificial element in MODRIC which has cross sections for a'l/v absorber

Circulating fuel reactors lose neutrons because some of the delayed

neutrons are emitted outside of the core. These losses depend on core

TREATMENT OF XENON ABSORPTION IN GRAPHITE

IL. G. Alexander
Introduction

Some 135Xe is formed directly during fission; however, the major
part (>90%) is formed by the decay of 1351 which has a half-life of 6.7
hours. The iodine remains in solution as the iodide ion (I"). Thus, at
equilibrium, the rate of formation of xenon in the fuel is proportional
to the sum of the direct fission yields of xenon and iodine, here taken
to be 0.066 atoms per fission.

Al] of the xenon is released in the fuel salt, and since the half-
life for the decay of 12°I is long compared to the time required for the
fuel to make one complete trip around the fuel circuit (about 15 seconds),
the rate of release of 13°Xe is nearly uniform throughout the fuel volume,
being augmented somewhat in the core by the direct fission yield. For
purposes of this study, the concentration of xenon in the salt was assumed
to be uniform.

The solubility of noble gases in molten salts is low (1), especially
in mixtures of LiF-BeFp. A concentration of only 2 X 10° atoms of xenon
per cc of salt at 1200°F is in equilibrium with a partial pressure of
xenon in the gas phase of one atmosphere. In the reference design case,
the equilibrium pressure is about 0.06 atmosphere.

Xenon thus tends to leave the salt at any phase boundary. It may
form microbubbles clinging to the surface of the graphite moderator. It
will tend to diffuse into the pores of the graphite. It can be removed
rapidly by spraying a portion of the circulating stream into a space
filled with helium or by subsurface sparging with helium.

Xenon is also removed from the system by decay to 1250s and by re-
action with neutrons to form 136¥e, which is stable and has a low neutron

capture cross section. : oo

THE EQUILIBRIUM STATE AS A BASIS FOR ECONOMIC
EVALUATION OF THORIUM REACTORS

T. W. Kerlin
/ Introduction

The equilibrium condition is currently being used as the basis for
fluid-fuel reactor economic evaluation and for new computer code develop-
ment. Because of this increasing application of calculations based on
the equilibrium state, it is advisable to clearly define equilibrium and
to assess the validity of evaluations based on the equilibrium condition.
These problems were considered in this study for thorium-fueled reactors,
fueled initially with 235y, and particularly for the molten-salt converter
reactor (MSCR).

The equilibrium condition is defined as that condition in which the
reactor composition is time independent because of a balance between
nuclide production rates and loss rates. It is important to note that
these are the total production and loss rates (including feed, recycle,
discharge, processing losses, etc.) and are not restricted to nuclear
transformation rates. The mathematical formulation of the equilibrium
state is obtained by setting the time derivative of the nuclide concen-

tration equal to zero:

—==Q *tR+F +T; +D —N(t; +d; +q,)=0, (1)
dat : :
where ~
N, = nuclide concentration of 1th nuclide,
t = time,

Q. = feed rate,
i
R. = recycle rate,

He

 

 
 

 

236

F, = fission fragment formation rate,

Ty = growth rate due to neutron capture in other materials,
Db, = growth rate due to radioactive decay in other materials,
ts = loss rate due to neutron capture in 1% nuclide,

d; = loss rate due to radioactive decay of ith nuclide,
q = processing loss rate.

Equation (1) should be valid for reactor evaluation if the nuclide con-
centration is near equilibrium (90-95%) over a large fraction (90-95%)
of the reactor's operating life.

Estimates of the saturation behavior of the nuclides of interest in

~ thorium-fueled reactors were made using the methods discussed below.

Methods

The time-dependent behavior of the nuclide concentrations in a thorium-
fueled reactor, fueled initially with 23°U, was calculated by solving
Eq. (1) without the restriction that dN, /dt = 0. The treatment for the
individual isotopes along with special assumption for each case is given

below:

1. Fission Products

Assume that fission products are produced at a constant rate, S, and
are removed by neutron capture, radioactive decay, and processing. This
leads to

where

T = time to process a complete reactor volume.

2. Uranium-233

Neglecting processing losses and captures in 233pq, the concentration

of 233y is given by

where
N23 = concentration of ?23U,
NO2 = concentration of ?322mn (assumed invariant),
od? = effective capture cross section of 232Th,
‘$= neutron flux (defined below),
023 = effective absorption cross section of 233.

The neutron flux is given by

where
P = reactor power (watts),

V = fuel volume (cc),
N, = concentration of fuel (atoms/cc),
Op = effective fission cross section (average over all fissile

The term, VN, is the total number of fissile atoms. Taking the average

f
atomic weight of the fissile nuclides as 235 gives

VN, = W X 2.563 X 102 ,

where

W = mass of fissile material (grams).

are very crude, but will suffice for the qualitative evaluation desired in

this study.

Results and Conclusions

The results are shown in Figs. H.1l through H.6. They are discussed

individually below:

1. Fission Products

Figure H.l shows the saturation behavior of a material removed only
by processing. In actual operation, the approach to saturation would be
faster because of nuclear transformations. It is clear from Fig. 1 that
the fission product nuclides which saturate slowly with respect to their
nuclear reaction rates are at equilibrium (90% or greater) for 90% of a
30-year reactor life for processing times of less than 500 days. A 1000-
day processing time (typical for the MSCR) gives equilibrium (90% or
greater) for only 80% of the time. Therefore, the equilibrium treatment
is doubtful for fission-product nuclides with low cross sections or long

half lives. However, these effects are small.

2. Uranium-233

Figure H.2 shows the saturation behavior of 233U. The curves show
that equilibrium (90% or greater) exists for 90% of the reactor life only
if the specific power is greater than about 1800 w/ gram. A specific power
of 750 w/gram (typical for the MSCR) insures equilibrium (90% or greater)
for 80% of the 30-year reactor life.

3. Uranium-234

Figure H.3 shows that 234y saturates very slowly for all practical
values of specific power. A specific power of 750 w/ gram (typical for
the MSCR) gives an average concentration over the 30-year reactor life

only 65% of the equilibrium value.

4. Uranium-235

Figure 4 shows the saturation behavior of ?35U. For a conversion
ratio of 0.8 and a specific power of 750 w/gram (typical MSCR conditions),
the 225U concentration is within 10% of the equilibrium concentration for

65% of the reactor operating life.

5. Uranium-236

Figure 5 shows that the approach to equilibrium is quite slow for
236, For a conversion ratio of 0.8 and a specific power of 750 w/gram
(typical MSCR conditions), the ?36U concentration never reaches 90% of the

equilibrium concentration.

6. Uranium-238

Figure H.6 shows the approach to saturation for 238y. For a con-
version ratio of 0.8 and a specific power of 750 w/gram (typical MSCR

conditions), equilibrium (90% or greater) is insured for 20% of a 30-year

reactor operating lifetime.

The results for the six materials considered in this study are shown
in Table H.1 for MSCR conditions.
Consideration of the methods used to obtain the results in Table H.1l

does not indicate high accuracy. However, the results should be qualitatively

correct; and they should create some concern over the validity of the
equilibrium state as a suitable condition for reactor economic evaluation.
Table H.2 shows the expected direction of the error introduced by assuming
the equilibrium condition for the nuclides considered. It is apparent
from Table H.2 that it is not possible to predict whether equilibrium cal-
culations are intrinsically optimistic or conservative from these results.
Also, since the relative magnitude of the competing effects depends on re-
actor type, the characteristics of the particular reactor must enter into
an assessment of the direction and magnitude of the error associated with
the equilibrium assumption.

The magnitude of the effect of these factors on reactor economic
evaluations is not known. However, an extensive study should be made to
examine these problems. Reactor evaluations based on the equilibrium con-
dition are so convenient, economical, and unambiguous that they should be

used if possible.

Viscosity

Experimental values of the viscosity of several different composi-

tions of the mixture LiF-BeF -UF, -ThF,, (and some estimated values) are

listed in Table 1.2 at tempenatures of 600°, 700° and 800°C, These are
plotted in Fig. I.1l which also includes plots of what appear to be rea-
sonable estimates of the viscosity of MSCR Salts 2 and 3, The estimates
on these two salts depend on the fact that their compositions lie between
those of Mixture 75 and Mixture 133 (which is the same as MSCR No. 1);
hence, their viscosity curves may be expected to lie between the curves
of the two known mixtures. Viscosities and temperature-dependent vis-
cosity equations of MSRE fuel and coolant salts are listed in Tables I.3
and I.4 for comparison,

The viscosity equation for Mixture 133 (MSCR No. 1) is (1):

Heat Capacity

The temperature-dependent equation for heat capacity of Mixture 133
is (1):

% = 0,473 - 0.000238 T cal/g-°C (T = °C)

Values of heat capacity of MSCR Salts 2 and 3 at a given temperature may
be estimated by interpolating between published values of other salts of
different molecular weights, since heat capacity of molten salts probably
varies inversely with molecular weight. Published values of heat capa-
city at 700°C of some known salts are shown in Fig. 1.2, which contains
a plot of heat capacity as a function of molecular weight.

Heat capacity relationships for MSRE fuel and coolant salts are
shown in Tables I.3 and I.4.

Thermal Conductivity

Like heat capacity, thermal conductivity can be expected to vary
inversely with molecular weight. An estimate of the thermal conductivi-
ties of the MSCR fuel salts has been made by extrapolating the published

FUEL AND CARRIER SALT COST BASES

W. L. Carter
Introduction

os LiF, BeF,,

ZrF, and NaF to determine current market prices. The data are evaluated

A survey was conducted among suppliers of ThE, , ThO

and a recommended set of values to be used in molten salt converter and
breeder reactor calculations is presented, The cost data are needed in
calculating fuel cycle costs,

The following values are recommended for use in molten salt reactor

calculations:
~ ThF,, $ 6.50 per pound
Bef, 7.00 per pound
LiF 14,70 per pound
ZrF, 4,00 per pound

One of the purposes of the study of thorium breeder and converter
reactors is to furnish comparative fuel cycle cost data on the various
systems as well as nuclear performance data. The market survey was con-
ducted to obtain current and reliable price information on several chem-
ical compounds which will be needed in rather large inventory and for

which the consumption rate may be significant, The inquiries were con-

cerned primarily with molten salt reactor materials, namely, thorium

fluoride, lithium floride, beryllium fluoride, zirconium fluoride and
sodium fluoride; in addition, prices were obtained for thorium oxide.

Several manufacturers of these chemicals were contacted, and a sum-

‘mary of their price schedules is given in Tables J.1 through J.6. Since

it is appropriate to associate a date with a market quotation, it may be
noted that these data were obtained during the period November 1961 -
January 1962. There is one exception: the comparative figures quoted

from document Y-1312 were published in December 1959,

Bases for Establishing Prices

It was assumed that prices would be established for a large molten
salt, power-producing system. Two conditions were visualized: (a) A
1000 Mwe (2500 Mwt) station and (b) ten of these 1000 Mwe stations in
simultaneous operation. These conditions established the initial inven-
tory requirements. The consumption rates were calculated by assuming
that the fuel salt would be discarded after removal of fissile material
on a 1000-day cycle, It was assumed that thorium and carrier salt could
not be decontaminated and recovered.

Vendors were asked to quote prices on the basis of producing mate-
rials in the quantities desired by existing methods and according to
current specifications. It was not considered appropriate to ask a ven-
dor in an information-seeking survey such as this to do much research
into manufacturing procedures and schedules if his operations would be
significantly affected by these additional quantities. Consequently, no
rigid specifications were affixed to these chemicals other than the ob-
vious one that all materials should have extremely low concentrations of

high neutron cross section materials,

General Comments on Price Quotations

Thorium Fluoride

Only one manufacturer was interested in making a quotation for ThF,,
and it was admitted that this was a rough approximation. The price com-
pared favorably with the value quoted by Orrison (1) in a previous

market survey.

Zirconium Fluoride

Vendors were asked to quote on hafnium-free ZrF,. The quantities

requested are apparently quite large compared with available production,

 
 

270

Beryllium Fluoride
The suppliers indicate that there would be no problem in supplying

the quantities requested. ‘Beryllium fluoride is an intermediate compound
in the production of beryllium metal. Although the vendors state that

the prices quoted are tentative, they are probably rather accurate.

Sodium Fluoride

This chemical is available in large supply. The quoted prices should
be quite firm, Sodium fluoride is so inexpensive that its use in a

reactor contributes negligibly to the fuel cycle cost.

Thorium Oxide

Thorium oxide is available in large supply; the quoted prices are
perhaps rather firm. The quotes compare favorably with the values given
by Orrison (1).

Lithium Fluoride

Lithium fluoride occupies a singular position in the molten salt
fuel system particularly with regard to availability and price. Since
the lithium content must have a high ’Li assay, the only source of mate-
rial is from AEC production facilities, AEC-ORO, Y-12 and ORGDP per-
sonnel (2) were instrumental in developing a classified price schedule
for high isotopic purity Li in quantities to meet the requirements of
a large molten salt power installation,

Lithium is produced as LiOH+H_0 for which a reasonably accurate

price can be computed. However, = uncertainty exists in the charge for
converting the hydroxide to an anhydrous fluoride product since this
operation has not been attempted except in small-scale batches; this
charge was estimated. A schedule of basic charges was recommended (3,4)

for computing the price of lithium fluoride in 99.995 at, % Li:

LiOH+H,0 =

LiOH-H,0 - LiF conversion =
Cascade feed cost (4) =
Base cost =

Plus 15% AEC overhead (4)

The values have not been released by the Atomic Energy Commission as
an official price for high purity Li; they are confidential information
for internal use only, |

The official price was $120/kg of Li metal as the fluoride in
November 1959 (5) for a grade containing 99.99% of "Li. This price was

adopted for material containing 99.995% "Li produced in large quantities.

Recommended Values for Molten Salt Fuel

Based on the values given in Tables J,1, J.3, J.4, and J.5, the fol-
lowing prices are recommended for use in molten salt reactor fuel cycle
calculations. These prices were chosen more or less arbitrarily from the
accumulated data since there was no reason to have more credence in one

value than another.

MSCR POWER LIMITATION RESULTING FROM
MODERATOR THERMAL STRESS

R. H. Chapman

Summary

In order to achieve the maximum performance from the MSCR, it is
necessary to operate at a power level corresponding to some limiting con-
dition. The limiting condition may be arbitrarily imposed upon the system
or it may be an inherent feature in the design. In certain conceivable
situations thermal stress in the graphite moderator may limit the power
output of a single reactor core. It is therefore of interest to estimate
the maximum power output as a function of core diameter for the case where
thermal stress is the limiting condition.

It is assumed for the purpose of this memorandum that the reactor core
is a cylinder of L/D = 1.0. Honeycomb shaped fuel channels are formed by
the proper spacing of hexagonal graphite moderator prisms. For the purpose
of estimating the thermal stress, it is also assumed that the hexagonal
prisms can be approximated by a right circular cylinder of a diameter equal
to the distance across the flats of the hex. It is noted from the geometry
of the hexagonal unit cell that the fuel volume fraction, fs the fuel
channel thickness, t.s and the distance across flats, d,, are interrelated.
Figure K.1 shows the relationship for the region of interest. The size
of the unit cell is obtained by adding the channel thickness to the dis-
tance across flats of the moderator prisms.

Assuming uniform heat generation, the maximum thermal stress (at the

surface) is given! for a solid cylinder as

Assuming values for the various properties of graphite, i.e., Ops Oy BE, v,
and k, and representative values for the fraction of total heat generated
in the graphite and for the peak-to-average power density ratio, a family
of curves of heat production versus diameter may be plotted wherein Tr, is
the parameter.

Choosing an allowable stress value of graphite is a somewhat arbitrary
operation. Experience has shown in the production of AGOT graphite for
the EGCR (16 in. X 16 in. X 20 ft long columns) that the mechanical prop-
erties vary widely between different blocks of the material, vary across
the cross-section of the large blocks, and depend on the orientation rela-
tive to the direction of extrusion.? Fracture strain is probably a better
criteria for failure than stress, since it has been shown to be fairly
constant at about 0.1 to 0.2%. Tests have also shown that strength is not
temperature dependent at least up to 1100°F. Since the ratio of stress to
modulus of elasticity appears in Eq. (4), the value of the fracture strain
can be substituted and thus side-step the issue of fraction stress. A
value of 0.1% is assumed as a failure criterion.

For Poisson's ratio a value of 0.4 is recommended, and for the thermal
coefficient of expansion, a value of 2.7 X 10*® in./in. °F is used. A
value of 15 BTU/hr-ft*°F is used for the thermal conductivity at 1200°F.%
A value of 2.5 is assumed for the ratio of peak-to-average power density
to account for the maximum thermal stress condition. This is about the
value computed for the MSRE.® A value of 0.05 is assumed for the fraction
of total heat produced in the moderator, essentially the same as for the
MSRE.

Multiplying the heat rate by the overall net thermodynamic efficiency,
one obtains the net power output. An assumed value of 40% efficiency is

used. With these assumptions Eq. (4) becomes

Figure K.2 is a plot of Eq. (5) for the range of interest. Also
shown in the figure are 500 and 1000 Mwe condition for fuel volume frac-
tions of 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20. With the figure, and for a given set of
conditions one is able to estimate quickly the maximum graphite size per-
mitted by thermal stress considerations. For example, if it is desired
to provide 1000 Mwe with single core of 20 ft diam and 10 vol. % fuel, it
is seen from the figure that the largest graphite moderator prism is
limited to about 9 in. across flats.

It should be pointed out that the data used in constructing the figure
are subject to considerable uncertainty. Design data for large sections of
graphite such as likely to be used in the M3SCR are, of course, unavailable
at this time. However, it is believed that the results obtained from the

figure will be conservative.

Appendix M

EVALUATION OF A GRAPHITE REFLECTOR FOR THE
MOLTEN SALT CONVERTER REACTOR

T. W. Kerlin
"Introduction

Nuclear calculations on large molten salt converter reactors (MSCR)
indicate that the neutron leakage is large enough (2 to 4% of the neutrons
produced) to warrant consideration of a graphite reflector. A reactor was
chosen from a set presently under study to evaluate the desirability of a
reflector. This reactor, which current results indicate is near the
optimum with respect to fuel cycle costs, has the characteristics given in
Table M.1.

Table M.1. Typical Characteristics of MSCR

 

Diameter of core, ft 17.7

Height of core, ft 17.7
Carbon-to-thorium ratio 293

Fuel salt composition 68LiF-23BeF,~5ThF),
Fuel salt volume fractiog 0.10

Fuel processing rate, ft“/day 2

 

The core consists of a graphite matrix inside a 2-in.-thick INOR-8
vessel. Because of the different coefficients of thermal expansion, the

vessel will move away from the graphite when the reactor is at power,

“creating an annulus. Since no adequate metal-to-graphite seal is avail-
able, this annulus will contain fuel salt.

The designer may choose to place a reflector between the core and the
annulus by merely increasing the size of the graphite region and omitting
fuel channels in the outer portion. The designer also might choose to pin
graphite blocks to the inside of the vessel so that the reflector moves

with the vessel, creating an annulus between the core and the reflector.

 
 

 

286

A third possibility is a combination of the above two methods, creating an
annulus between two reflector regions.

Calculations were made to determine the relative characteristics of
the MSCR with (a) no reflector, (b) a 15-in. reflector outside the annulus,
(c¢) a 7.5-in, graphite region between the core and annulus and a 7.5-in.
graphite region outside the annulus. The core composition was determined
by an iterative procedure to achieve equilibrium with respect to a

2 £t3/day fuel processing rate.

“ "Results

The results are summarized in Table M,2. Here the materials cost is

the sum of the inventory and replacement costs. The leakage includes all

neutrons which escape from the system, are captured in the vessel, or are

captured in the reflector,

These results show that the reflector outside of the annulus improves
performance slightly, but that the other reflected reactors have poorer
performance. This behavior can be clarified by examining the power density
distributions shown in Fig. M.l. B

~The reactor with the reflector outside the annulus shows a large peak

in power in the annulus because of the large thermal flux from the reflector.

Since a peak in the fission rate occurs, the source of neutrons aimed out
of the reactor is increased; however, the reflector returns many of the
neutrons leaving the annulus. The net effect, as shown in Table M.2, is a
slight reduction in leakage. |

The reactor with the reflector between the core and annulus experi-
ences a considerable flattening of the power distribution. The fission
rate in the annulus remains large and furnishes a large source of neutrons
adjacent to the reactor periphery. This source is larger than for the un-
reflected case, and a higher leakage results.

The reactor with the graphite regions on each side of the annulus com-
bines the bad features of cases 2 and 3. The fission rate is large in the
annulus, giving a large source for neutrons to the reactor periphery.

Thus it is seen that the main reason that a reflector has such a
small effect is the presence of the fuel annulus. Any addition of reflec-
tor increases the fission rate in this region. These fission neutrons are
close to the reactor periphery, where they may be absorbed in the vessel
or leak out of the reactor. A reflector would be much more beneficial if

a design which eliminated the fuel annulus could be devised,

Conclusions

Use of a reflector in the MSCR improved the reactor performance only
slightly [0.02 increase in conversion ratio and 0.04 mills/kwhr (electrical)
decrease in fuel cycle costs]. Of the reflected-reactor configurations
considered, the reactor with the reflector outside of the fuel annulus was
the only one which improved performance. However, a method of pinning
graphite to the vessel without leaving large cracks is unknown. Also, the
extra cost of fabricating an INOR-8 vessel 2,5 ft larger is unknown,
Therefore, in view of the slight benefit to be gained and the added design
uncertainties and complexity, it appears that no reflector should be used
in the MSCR study. If these uncertainties should be removed and slight
improvements in performance become important, the gains available with a

reflector should be exploited.

DETAILED ESTIMATE OF 1000 Mwe MSCR CAPITAL INVESTMENT?

C. H. Hatstat™®

Summary

The cycle chosen for this analysis is shown in elementary form in
Fig. 4.3. A 2500 Mwt reactor is cooled with a fuel-bearing molten salt,
from which heat is transferred to an inert salt in eight vertical shell-
and-tube heat exchangers; the heat in the inert salt is removed in a sys-
tem of 16 shell-and-tube superheaters and eight reheaters, of a design
similar to that of the superheaters. Approximately 63% of the superheated
steam flows to a system of four Loeffler boilers, where it produces satu-
rated steam by mixing with the turbine feed water. The remaining super-
heated steam is delivered at 2400 psi, 1000°F, to the throttle of the steam
turbine, Exhaust steam from the high-pressure turbine elements. is reheated
to 1000°F in the reheaters and flows to the intermediate pressure turbine,
from which it flows to a 6-flow low-pressure unit. Condensate is returned
to the Loeffler boilers through eight stages of feed-water heating. The

gross power output of the cycle is 1083 Mwe at a throttle steam flow of

approximately 8 x 106 1b/hr and a condenser pressure of 1.5-in. Hg.

The plant design is based on an Atomic Energy Commission reference
site in Western Massachusetts, The site is assumed to have an adequate
source of circulating water for the turbine. Because of the low vapor
pressure of the reactor coolant, high-pressure containment is not consid-

ered necessary; the reactor and its auxiliaries are contained in a sealed,

steel lined concrete structure which forms a part of a subdivided biolo-
gical shield with a total thickness of 10 feet.

The turbine-generator and the other components of the steam-condensate

system are housed in a conventional steel frame building. The turbine

building and the reactor building are arranged so that one traveling bridge
crane services both buildings.
Other structures on the site which are included in the cost estimate
are the crib house, circulating water intake and discharge flumes and
tunnels, waste disposal building and stack, and foundations for oil and
condensate tanks. Road and rail access are also provided for the plant.
The cost estimate includes all systems and components necessary for
a complete plant. In addition to the energy conversion components, the
following equipment and/or systems are estimated in detail.
1, Radioactive waste treatment and disposal systems and building.

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MSCR MODERATOR

-L, G, Alexander
Introduction

The reactor vessel contains the moderator and holds it in a stable
position during all phases of operation, provides for accepting fuel dis-
charged from the heat exchangers, passage of fuel through the moderator,
and discharge to the fuel pumps.

The reactor must be designed to expose the fuel to neutrons at a spe-
cified ratio of graphite volume to fuel volume. The graphite must be sup-
ported and restrained under all circumstances, including the drained
condition, Allowance must be made for differential expansion between
graphite and vessel. Provision must be made for distributing the flow of
fuel over the core entrance, and for collecting the flow at the exit. A
free surface in an expansion chamber must be provided somewhere in the fuel
circuit, and circulation through the expansion chamber must be maintained,
Provision must be made for preheating the reactor vessel prior to charging
molten salt, and for cooling the reactor vessel during operation and after
shutdown. This cooling must be accomplished without the generation of ex-
cessive thermal stresses. The vessel must be designed in conformance with
the pressure vessel code. Means of sparging the fuel in the expansion
chamber with an inert gas must be provided to remove xenon and other vola-'
tile materials. Excessive thermal stress in the graphite must be avoided,
and it must be composed of pieces sufficiently small that differential
shrinkage due to exposure to neutrons will be tolerable in each piece.

Stagnation of the fuel between adjacent blocks of graphite or between
graphite and metal structure must be avoided if such stagnation leads to’
excessive temperatures or stresses in either the fuel, graphite, or metal
structure. Temperature at the fuel-graphite interface should be below
that at which chemical reaction, if any, takes place at an appreciable -

rate, and below the temperature at which any important constituent of the

3

a

329

salt (other than volatile fission products) has appreciable vapor pres-
sure (e.g., if UF, were to vaporize appreciably and diffuse into pores

in the graphite, this would be disadvantageous and perhaps hazardous).

Temperature gradients in the graphite near stagnation areas should not

exceed those corresponding to tolerable thermal stresses,

In the MSCR it is desirable, in order to reduce the graphite surface
exposed to permeation by salt and fission product gases, to use moderator
elements of larger diameter than in the MSRE. On the other hand, setting
an allowable thermal strain of 0.001 imposes an upper limit, A diameter
of about six to eight inches appears to be a suitable compromise between
the conflicting requirements,

It would be desirable for the logs to extend the length of the core,
but radiation damage may induce a tendency for the logs to bow outward
and this would increase the volume fraction of fuel in the core. This
increase is controlled and largely eliminated by using logs 24 in. long
and stacking these in a vertical position, The ends are mated by means
of pins and sockets. Differential shrinkage of the graphite is now accom-
modated by a slight rotation about the pins,

Fuel salt should permeate the graphite not more than 0.1% by volume.
With this penetration, and 10 volume per cent of fuel in the core, about
one per cent of the fuel will be in the pores in the graphite. This is
probably tolerable, especially if the accessible pores are those near the
surface, as seems to be the case.

Fuel stagnation in cracks between blocks and in pores in the blocks

is closely related to the problem of afterheat, since the fuel so in-

‘volved is probably not readily drainable. Means of flushing the fuel-

salt thus retained must be provided if possible, and if this is not
possible, means must be provided of removing the heat generated in the
core after drainage.

Temperature rise and thermal stress in the reactor vessel must be
limited to tolerable levels, Differential thermal expansion will leave a
gap between the graphite structure and the reactor vessel not less than
1 in. in the radial direction. It will be necessary to provide some flow
through this annulus not only to remove the heat generated there, but

also to cool the reactor vessel,

 
 

 

330

)

It will be necessary to orifice the flow channels, or otherwise
vary their width systematically in order to distribute the flow through
the core compatibly with the power density distribution to achieve uni-

form temperature rise in ell fuel channels.

Moderator

In the MSRE (1), the moderator is constructed of square graphite
bars measuring 2 inches on the sides and 63 inches long. Channels 0.4
inches deep and 1.2 inches wide are machined into alternate faces of the
‘bars, which are pinned loosely to beams lying across the bottom of the
vessel. The channels occupy 22.5% of the volume of the matrix.

The shape, size, and spacing of the MSRE moderator elements are not
suitable for the MSCR. The pieces need to be larger and the volume of
fuel needs to be of the order of 10 percent.

The void fraction in a matrix formed by closely packed cylinders of
uniform diameter is 0.093. Such a matrix appears to be structurally
stable, is easily assembled in a close array, and provides a minimum of
contact between individual pieces. This last is important in that the
amount of stagnant fuel is probably roughly proportional to the total
area of contact. Small variations in radius, circularity, and straight-
ness of the cylinders can be tolerated, and a voidage as low as 10% still
be achieved. Higher voidages can be obtained by machining away portions
of the surface of the cylinders; in fact, the voidage can be systema-
tically varied both radially and axially in this way. The relative
positions of the logs are fixed by contact of the unmachined portions at
the top and bottom. It should thus be possible to reduce power peaking
in the reactor and, by a combination of orificing and power flattening,
to obtain a good match between radial distributions of flow and power
density and thus achieve approximate equal temperature rise in all fuel
channels.

In the MSCR study, fuel-volume fractions in the range from 0.1 to
0.2 were investigated. The optimum fraction appears to be slightly o

Ww

 
»

*y

 

 

 

 

331

greater than 0.1. It appears undesirable to design a matrix having a
fuel fraction much smaller than this, At low fuel fractions, dimensional
tolerances in the machining of the logs and assembling of the matrix in-
troduce uncertainties that become an appreciable fraction of the fuel
volume, This uncertainty can be reduced somewhat by using logs of large
cross section, but there are limits, viz.: (a) a limit on the size of
log that can currently or in the foreseeable future be manufactured; (b)
a limit imposed by thermal stress in the log, which becomes excessive
with increasing size. Graphite logs measuring 16 inches in diameter can
be made now (1962); while these are not of a grade satisfactory for use
in the MSCR, it is not a great extrapolation of current technology to
postulate the availability of graphite logs of satisfactory grade in
sizes up to 8-inches in diameter, and this appears to be as large as
thermal strain considerations will allow.

If the volume fraction of fuel in the core is small, then any slight
variation in this volume fraction would have an appreciable effect on the
reactivity and might result in power excursions. These variations might
arise in any of a number of ways. For instance, radiation damage might
result in the accumulation of stresses in the graphite which, upon sudden
removal of external restraints (such as by the failure of the hoops,
etc.) or by the yielding of the material itself, might result in gross
movement of the matrix, and a sudden increase in reactivity.

Also, at very low volume fractions, the optimum concentrations of
fissile and fertile isotopes in the fuel stream becomes high, and this
imposes requirements on the design of the external system in regard to

hold-up, velocities, etc., that are difficult to meet.

Permeation of Graphite by Salt

Graphite is not impervious to salt. The presence of an appreciable
fraction of the salt in stagnant pockets introduces a number of problems
(such as that associated with the fate of fission products generated in
stagnant fuel). The "theoretical" density of graphite is 2.25 grams/cc.
MSRE graphite has a bulk density of about 1.83, and thus the pore

 
 

 

 

332

fraction is about 0.16. The pores accessible to a wetting fluid, such

as kerosene or a gas, however, amount to only 0.07% of the volume,
Graphite is not wetted by molten fluoride salts, and the penetration is
an order less than that of a wetting fluid. Treatment by any one of
several methods (5) reduces the penetration further, either by filling
the pores, by closing them, or by making the entrances smaller. Tests in
which CGB-X graphite, newly proposed for the MSRE, was exposed to salt
at 1300°F and 150 psi for 100 hours resulted in volume fraction permea-
tions of 0.001 and 0.0002 (2, p. 93). The occlusions of salt lay mostly
at the surface, and were presumably in reasonably good diffusional com-
munication with the bulk fluid. The pieces tested were necessarily
small, and the proportion of surface exposed was high. Estimates based
on expected frequency of surface pores in larger pieces led to a predic-
tion of a penetration not greater than 0.0016 in the MSRE graphite at

65 psi pressure in the salt (2, p. 91). Taking advantage of the fact
that the number of surface pores can be reduced by proper orientation of
the surface grains and that with larger bars the ratio of surface-to-
volume is less, it appears plausible that a salt-accessible pore fraction
of 0,001 can be assumed for MSCR graphite. Now, if the graphite occupies
90% of the matrix, salt-accessible pores in the graphite amount to
roughly 0.1%, which is only 1% of the total fuel fraction. However, the
fuel in these pores may be retained when the reactor is drained, and
this may present a serious operational difficulty in regard to cooling
the reactor after shutdown, especially if the core is drained shortly

after operation at power.

Graphite Shrinkage

The graphite will, of course, be subjected to radiation damage,
mostly from fast neutrons. At the temperatures anticipated in the MSCR,
the graphite will shrink. Since that side of a log closest to the center
of the core will absorb more radiation than the outer side, the logs
will tend to bow outward, and increase the volume fraction of the fuel.

These effects will take place slowly, of course, and can easily be

 
 

oF

(=

333

compensated, in respect to criticality, by increasing the concentration
of thorium in the fuel or by decreasing that of the uranium, The breeding
ratio will necessarily decrease, however, due to shifting of the C/Th/U
ratio from the optimum. As mentioned above, the effect is minimized by

the use of short logs.

Graphite Replacement

The precise effect of graphite shrinkage on the performance (as mea-
sured by the fuel cycle cost) has not been determined; however, if it
proves to be serious, one or more of several countermeasures may be taken,
The simplest would be to replace the graphite periodically. The excess
sinking fund cost (@ 6.75%) over that corresponding to sinking fund amor-
tization over a thirty-year life (1.11%, and which is charged off to cap-

ital costs) is listed below in Table 0.1 for several replacements periods.

It is seen that, if the replacement occurs no oftener than once in
ten years, the incremental cost is tolerable, being less than 10% of a
typical fuel cost of 0.75 mills/kwhr.

If the shrinkage rate is such as to require replacement more often
than this, then part of the fuel volume fraction increase might be avoided

by restraining the core and preventing the bowing of the logs. Hoops of

 
 

 

334

molydbenum, which have a coefficient of thermal expansion very nearly -
equal to that of graphite (3) could be placed around the core (4, p. 32).
Of course, should the hoops fail suddenly, an excursion in the power
level might result. On the other hand, if the hoops held, accumulated
stresses in the graphite might result in the formation of cracks in which
the fuel might stagnate with deleterious effect.

The fuel volume fraction can be made self-preserving in spite of
radiation induced shrinkage by use of interlocking blocks of graphite.
The moderator elements are cubes having four holes, or sockets, in the
four quadrants of the upper face and four corresponding pegs extending
from the lower face. After a layer of blocks has been laid, the blocks
of the next layer are positioned so that the axis of each block lies over
the intersections of the fuel channel planes between adjacent blocks. in
the lower layer, with its pins fitting into sockets in four blocks in
that layer. Thus each cube is pinned to four overlapping cubes in the
layer above and four in the layer below. With cubes measuring 8 inches
along an edge, and a void fraction of 10%, the thickness of the passage
between adjacent cubes is approximately 0.4 inches when the blocks rest
directly on the blocks below, and 0.3 inches when uniform clearance is
provided on all six sides of the blocks. Now, as the blocks shrink, the
fuel volume fraction is invariant, since this is’ determined by the
spacing of the pegs and sockets and the dimensions of the blocks.

This arrangement, while solving one problem, introduces others,
chief of which is a much increased resistance to flow of the fuel through
the core, which may increase by a factor of perhaps 20. This would in-
crease the pumping cost and the design requirements for pumps, heat
exchangers and reactor vessel.

If difficulty with short-circuiting of the fuel through the annular
gap between moderator and reactor vessel is encountered, this could be
controlled by eliminating the gaps between the outer blocks of graphite
so that the blocks fit tightly one against the other. The annulus thus
becomes a channel unconnected to the voids in the moderator, and the
flow through it could be orificed at the top where the pile floats up

against the upper support grid.

The foregoing discussion of the problem of graphite shrinkage indi-
cates some solutions that might be applied if the problem should prove
to be serious, but it should not be inferred therefrom that the problem
is known to be serious, for in fact, it may not be. There are indica-
tions (6) that radiation damage may anneal and saturate at the tempera-
ture of operation. In that event, the core would be designed so that,
after the steady state is reached, the fuel volume fraction is at the

desired value,

Differential Expansion

The coefficient of thermal expansion of graphite is smaller than that
of INOR (compare Tables 3.2 and 3.1). Thus, in a 20-ft core with the
graphite just filling the vessel at room temperature, there will be a gap
about 2/3-in., wide between the graphite and the vessel wall at 1100°F,

If further allowance is made for dimensional tolerances between metal and
graphite during assembly, the gap cannot be much less than one inch thick
at operating temperatures,

This gap will contain fuel salt, and this fact must be taken into
account in evaluating the performance of the reactor and in the design of
the core and the reactor vessel. In a 20 ft cylindrical core the volume
of fuel in the annulus amounts to ~ 100 £3, which is an appreciable
fraction of the volume of fuel in the matrix (v 600 f£t°), This fuel lies
in a region of low neutron population so that it adds little to the re-
activity, Also, it is nearly opaque to thermal neutrons which are
absorbed, multiplied by eta, and re-emitted as fast neutrons, thus in-
creasing the leakage. This concentrated source of fast neutrons and
concomitant gamma radiation adjacent to the reactor vessel wall intro-
duces design problems. It may be necessary to provide a thermal shield
between the fuel annulus and the wall. The most suitable material for
this shield is INOR, but this must be cooled. The only available
cooling medium in this situation is the fuel salt, and its use for this

purpose further increases the nonactive inventory of valuable materials.

 
 

336

It may be possible to use the fuel annulus as a downcomer for fuel

coming from the heat exchangers. This may or may not result in some -

saving in fuel inventory, depending on the location of the exchangers

and their requirements for draining, etc. The annulus is so used in the
MSRE (1).
