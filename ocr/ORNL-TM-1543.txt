ABSTRACT

Three types of experiments involving removal of protactinium
from molten fluoride breeder blanket mixtures were performed. The
first showed that addition of thorium oxide to an LiF-BeF,-ThF,
mixture containing a tracer concentration of 233Pa (less than
0.1 ppb) precipitated the protactinium and that treatment of the

. mixture with HF redissolved the protactinium. In another experi-
ment equilibration of molten LiF-ThF, containing 26 ppm of 231Ppa
with a lead-thorium alley resulted in removal of 99% of the pro-
rs tactinium from the salt phase but only a fraction of the reduced
protactinium was found in the molten metal. A small amount of
protactinium was transferred from the molten metal to a salt
mixture by hydrofluorination treatment. In the third type of
N experiment, which was performed in both nickel and copper con-
tainers, exposure of solid thorium metal to molten LiF-ThF,
containing 20 to 30 ppm of %23!Pa precipitated 81 to 98% of the
protactinium. More than half of the reduced protactinium was
found in the unfiltered salt mixture, probably associated with
small metal particles produced by the preliminary HF treatment
of the mixture followed by hydrogen reduction. Again, hydro-
fluorination of the mixture redissolved the protactinium. Efforts
are continuing to find container materials to improve the reten-
tion of protactinium in molten lead or bismuth.

Introduction

A protactinium isotope, %233Ppa (half-life 27 days), is

an intermediate product in the conversion of 232Th to fission-

able 233y,

It has been recognized for some time that it would

be desirable to have a process for removing 233pa from fluoride

breeder blanket mixtures used in a two-region molten fluoride

reactor.

Earlier studies?! demonstrated that additions of BeO

or ThO, to one molten fluoride breeder blanket mixture precipi-

tated protactinium and that hydrofluorination of the mixture

redissolved the precipitate.

More recently, design and evalu-

ation studies? pointed out the strong economic incentive for

development of a Pa-removal scheme that could be applied in

large thermal molten salt breeder reactors. This document

is a progress report of part of the continuing effort to

develop improved Pa-removal methods. Results of a more

extensive program that is being conducted by another ORNL

group using tracer concentrations of 233Pa will be reported

elsewhere. Preliminary results of this investigation have been

published.’

The present report deals primarily with studies

conducted with Pa concentrations in the part per million range

expected to be reached under reactor operating conditions. A

mixture of 23!pa and 233pa was used in order to attain the

required concentration without the excessively high gamma

activity levels associated with milligram quantities of 233pa,

Small amounts of this isotope (about 1 mc) were added to

facilitate quick evaluation of concentration changes occurring

pect to the accu-
led in this report, or that the use
in this report may not infringe
during the experiments by use of gross gamma counting tech-
niques. The actual concentration of 233Pa was five orders of

magnitude less than the 231Ppa concentration.

Conclusions

1. A tracer level experiment (less than 0.1 ppb 233pa)
showed that protactinium was precipitated from a molten LiF-
BeF, -ThF, mixture by additions of ThO,, confirming the

1 and that the precipitated pro-

results of earlier studies,
tactinium was redissolved by a hydrofluorination treatment.

2. Equilibration of a molten fluoride mixture contain-
ing 26 ppm 231pa with a lead-thorium alloy resulted in removal
of 99% of the protactinium from the salt phase, but only a
fraction of the reduced protactinium was found in the molten
metal. A small amount (5%) of the reduced protactinium was
transferred from the molten lead to a fluoride salt mixture
by a brief hydrofluorination treatment. It appears that
better container materials are needed to assure the success
of this Pa-removal technique.

3. Precipitation of ppm concentrations of 231Ppa in
molten LiF-ThF, (73-27 mole %) can be accomplished by reduc-
tion with thorium metal. The reduction rate was increased
by an increase in surface area. Hydrofluorination treatment
of the reduced mixture redissolved the protactinium.

4. When the reduction of protactinium was effected by

thorium turnings in nickel equipment, the largest fraction

>

-

(more than half) was found in the salt, probably associated
with small nickel particles, and about 20% was associated with
the nickel-plated copper screen used to support the thorium
in the melt. A comparatively small amount of the reduced
protactinium was found on the nickel dip leg and vessel wall.
5. A similar distribution of reduced protactinium was
found in copper apparatus. The results of the one experiment
performed with this container material suggest that it is

more difficult to dissolve Pa in copper containers than in

nickel.
Experimental
Facilities

All the studies reported here were performed in the High-
Alpha Molten-Salt Laboratory, which is described in other
reports, although the initial experiment was conducted with
a small amount of 233Pa that does not require glove boxes
for safe handling.

Procedure for Thorium oxide Precipitation Experiment
A flanged nickel pot, Fig. 1, was used for this experi-

ment. A pretreated 516 g batch of LiF-BeF,-ThF, (73-2-25

mole %), to which 1 mc of 233Pa had been added to 3 kg of

material, was placed in a 2-in diameter nickel liner inside
the nickel pot. After sealing, the pot was evacuated and
filled with helium. Helium was introduced into the pot

through the dip leg at a rate of 350 cm3/min while the

contents of the pot were heated to a temperature of 575°C.

Hydrogen was substituted for helium at this point and then
15 min later, at a temperature of 590°, HF was mixed ‘with.

the hydrogen in the approximate volume ratio 10 H,:1 HF.

After 40 min HF treatment (final temperature 605°) hydrogen
flow continued for 60 min to effect reduction of NiF, intro-
duced by the hydrofluorination treatment. Since the HF
content of the effluent gas stream was not monitored in these

experiments, there was no way to determine when reduction of

- NiF, was completed.

The sampling procedure consisted of connecting the
copper filter units (see Fig. 2) -to the gas manifold inside
the glove box by means of flexible 1/4-in plastic tubing and

Swagelok fittings. Helium was used to flush out the unit for

several minutes and then it was introduced into the pot, sealed

by tightening a 3/8-in Swagelok nut around a Teflon gasket,
and then the filter was immersed in the melt with helium still
flowing through it. After allowing time for the filter to

reach the temperature of the molten salt mixture, helium flow

was terminated and a vacuum was applied to pull a sample of

‘the melt into the filter. After the full available vacuum

was reached (23 to 26 in.), the filter was raised to a point

near the top of the pot and allowed to cool for a few minutes

before, removing it from the pot. The filter was then sacri-

ficed to recover the filtered salt mixture. This was weighed

and then a 1 gm portion of each sample was weighed, placed in

"a small vial, and bagged out in a plastic bag for gross gamma

counting and for #33pa analysis by gamma spectrometry.

Procedure for Reduction by Molten Pb-Th Alloy

One experiment (Run 1-12) was conducted in which pro-

tactinium reduction was effected by metallic thorium in the

presence of liquid lead using welded nickel pots of the type

shown in Fig. 2. This experiment comprised a number of steps

extending over a period of several days:

1.

Mixed 1 ml of 17 M HF solution containing 9.0 mg 231Pa
with 4.0 gram irradiated ThF, containing 1.1 mc of 233pa
evaporated to dryness, added to an unlined nickel pot
containing 330 gram LiF-ThF, (73-27 mole %), hydrofluori-
nated the mixture at 600°C, and reduced at 625°C for 4 hrs
20 min, cooled to room temperature under helium.

Repeated HF-H, treatment because 38 gram of the salt
mixture had formed a plug near the top of the pot that
prevented sampling of the melt; cooled to room tempera-
ture under helium,

Connected the nickel pot containing the treated salt to

a tantalum-lined nickel pot containing 692 gram of Pb-Th
alloy saturated with Th at 600°C. Effected transfer of
salt to the lined pot with the pots at 650°C and the

transfer line at 600°.

Added about 5 gram of thorium turnings to the mixture

after 141 min equilibration of phases. Cooled to room

temperature under helium after 434 min contact time.

 
 

 

10

5. Put 206 gram of uncontaminated LiF-ThF, mixture in the
nickel pot used at the beginning of the experiment, after
removal of residual salt, gave the melted mixture a 20
min HF-H, treatment followed by 3 hrs H, treatment and
cooled to room temperature under helium. |

6. Connected the salt pot to the pot containing the lead
and Pa-contaminated salt. Heated to 500°C and applied
vacuum to the salt pot to effect transfer of lead phase.
Cooled to room temperature under helium.

7. Disconnected pots and weighed to determine amount of

| material transferred.

8. Heated the pot containing the fresh salt plus transferred
lead to 625°C and treated the mixture for 60 min with
HF-H, gas. Cooled to room temperature under helium.

Sampling of the salt phase was performed with copper
filters. Stainless steel filter units were used to take most
of the samples of the lead phase hut, in two instances,
improper positioning of copper filter units resulted in
removal of lead samples in these units. The samplers were
connected to the glove box manifold by means of flexible
plastic tubing, and sampling was carried out in the manner
described in the previous section.

Procedure for Solid Thorium Reduction Experiments

The procedure used in these experiments should be evident
from the tabulated data and the discussion of results in the

following section.

Results and Discussion

 

Oxide Precipitation

 

A summary of the only complete experiment on precipita-
tion of protactinium by oxide addition is given in Table 1.
This test was conducted with only a tracer concentration of
233pa present in the melt in order to check out the glove box
equipment before the system became contaminated with a high
activity isotope such as ?3pPa. The 233Pa activity in the
melt (1 millicurie in 3 kg of melt) is equivalent to a con-
centration of approximately 0.02 parts per billion.

The data in Table 1 show that ThO, effects the precipi-
tation of 233Pa from molten LiF-BeF,-ThF, and that the pro-
tactinium can be redissolved by hydrofluorinating the mixture
long enough to convert the ThO, to ThF,. It appears that,
under the conditions used in this experiment, precipitation
of %#33pa occurs rather slowly and additions of ThO, were made
too rapidly to permit determination of the amount required
for complete precipitation at equilibrium. The re-precipis
tation of partially redissolved 233Pa shown by Sample #13
was due to water vapor from the dry ice-cooled hydrogen trap
that warmed up during overnight operation. The reason for
the low value in Sample #15 is not clear.

When the top of the flanged pot was removed at the con-
clusion of the experiment, it was found that a large part of
the fused salt mixture had frozen on the liner wall approxi-

mately two inches above the surface of the melt. A large

temperature gradient exists in the furnace well due to the
necessity of maintaining a cool glove box floor. Part of

the mixture obviously splashed up the wall to a point below
the freezing point of the melt. This material was removed,
weighed, ground and analyzed for 233Ppa content along with a
sample of the material in the bottom of the liner. The
results are recorded at the bottom of Table 1. This finding,
together with the above-mentioned failure to reach equilibrium
after each ThO, addition, robs the experiment of any quanti-
tative significance. However, the previously stated quali-

tative conclusions are not affected.
Reduction by Molten Pb-Th Alloy

The data in Table 2 confirm the results of tracer-level
experiments conducted earlier by other investigators? at this
laboratory. In brief this experiment demonstrated that pro-
tactinium can be effectively removed from a molten salt
mixture by contacting it with molten lead containing thorium
but it also showed that only part of the protactinium content
of the salt can be found in the molten lead. Protactinium
that does stay in the lead long enough to permit transfer to
a new pot can be recovered in a molten fluoride by hydro-

fluorinating the mixture. The exact amount of protactinium

present in the molten lead seems to be open to question. Most

of the samples of this phase were removed by use of stainless
steel filter units. The exterior wall of each unit was scraped

to remove any salt adhering to it and then it was treated with

acid before dissolving. It was found possible to dissolve
the jackets with only a small part of the lead sample while
the bulk of the lead was dissolved and analyzed separately.
The results are shown in Table 3. It was not feasible to
make a similar separation in the case of the samples obtained
with copper samplers. The data in Table 3 demonstrate that
very little of the protactinium associated with the samples
was in the filtered lead. It seems likely that protactinium
was removed from the lead while passing through the sintered
stainless steel filter media but, since this material was
dissolved along with the side wall, evidence in support of
this belief cannot be given at present. The higher pro-
tactinium content of the samples obtained with the copper
filter units, as compared to the stainless steel samples,
likewise cannot be explained on the basis of presently avail-

able information.

Reduction With Solid Thorium

 

The first experiment in which a solid thorium rod was
exposed to a molten fluoride mixture containing protactinium
(Run 2-22) gave somewhat anomalous results, probably due to
electrochemical effects. The results can be summarized as

follows: Exposure of the 3/8-in diameter rod to 240 gram

of LiF-ThF, (73-27 mole %) at 625°C for 65 min resulted in

a reduction in 23!pa content of the melt from 11.1 mg to

0.087 mg (0.8% of starting concentration). A further 5-hr

exposure resulted in an increase in 23! Ppa content of the

melt, based on analysis of the filtered sample, to 0.54 mg
(4.9%). Samples obtained during 63 hrs treatment of the melt
with a H,-HF mixture gave protactinium contents varying from
3 to 16% of the initial concentration. It was found that 70%
of the bottom 17> inch of the rod (28 g) had been eroded by
the exposure. The recovered salt had a large amount of black
material in it, some of which was magnetic and analyzed 45%
nickel and 30% thorium. It contained 0.15 mg 23 Pa per gram.
The non-magnetic material contained 22% nickel, 49.5% thorium,
and 0.27 mg 23!Pa per gram. It seems likely that the thorium
rod was in contact with the bottom of the nickel pot during
this experiment, causing a current flow that eroded the rod.
The chunks of black material were rather brittle and it seems
probable that they were compacts of finely divided thorium
and nickel particles rather than alloys, together with a small
amount of the LiF-ThF, salt.

Another experiment (Run 3-2) was performed in which a
section of the same 3/8-in thorium rod used in Run 2-22 was
exposed to a fresh 243 gram batch of LiF-ThF, under the same
conditions used in the previous experiment except that care
was exerted to prevent contact of the rod with the bottom of
the nickel pot. Measurements were also made of the potential
difference between the nickel rod which supported the thorium
(insulated from the body of the pot by a Teflon bushing) and
the grounded shell of the pot. During the first immersion

of the rod, a value of 0.161 volt (grounded side negative)

 
 

18

was measured. During the second immersion, the value varied
from 0.242 to 0.231 volt.

Data obtained in this experiment are summarized in
Table 4. Reduction of Pa occurred at a much slower rate
and there was no noticeable erosion of the thorium rod. The
drop in 231p, concentration that occurred on remelting the
mixture after the initial HF and hydrogen reduction treat-
ment was completed and the melt had ccoled overnight under
‘helium probably indicates that some oxide contamination of
the melt occurred. There is no obvious explanation for the
drop in 231pa concentration in the 6th sample. It may
indicate non-equilibrium conditions in the mixture. The
high concentration in the ground (-80 mesh) sample of
recovered salt seems to indicate that the initial HF treat-
ment of the melt was inadequate for complete dissolution of
the added 23! Ppa.

The slow reduction of dissolved 23! Pa observed in Run
3-2 encouraged efforts to increase the reduction rate by
increasing the surface area of the solid thorium metal in
Run 3-10. A nickel-plated copper screen was used to support
3.6 gram of thorium metal turnings in the melt which con-
sisted of the salt recovered from the previous experiment.
The data obtained are shown in Table 5. The data indicate
that a larger thorium surface area did indeed increase the
rate of protactinium reduction, as expected. The treatment

of the melt with thorium was not extended because the basket

came loose from its support rod the first time that an
attempt was made to remove it from the pot. The thorium
was apparently dissolved by the hydrofluorination treatment
as the basket was completely empty, except for some solidi-
fied salt, when it was removed from the melt. In this case,
the ground (-80 mesh) recovered salt showed a 23!Pa concen-
tration slightly lower than the initial value. The 23!pa
content of the first sample was exactly the same as that of
the last filtered sample (No. 7) in Table 4 and this agreement
casts doubt on the validity of the high %3!Pa content of
sample A, Table 4.

Run 3-31 was essentially a repeat of Run 3-2 except that
no effort was made to return the reduced protactinium to
solution. The apparatus was disassembled and all parts that
had been in contact with the melt were analyzed for 231pa
content in order to determine the distribution of reduced
protactinium in the nickel equipment. The results given in
Table 6 show that more than half of the reduced protactinium
was in the unfiltered salt mixture, probably attached to
small metal particles dispersed in the salt mixture, about
1/5 was adsorbed on (or alloyed with) the nickel-plated
copper basket, and only 7% reached the wall of the nickel
pot. As is indicated in Table 6, some magnetic particles
were removed from the recovered salt. There is no good
explanation at present for the missing 20% of the protactinium.

An experiment similar to Run 3-31 was conducted with the

melt in contact with copper or thorium rather than nickel or
thorium as in Run 3-31. The results of this experiment (Run
4-12) are displayed in Table 7. The distribution of reduced
protactinium in the copper apparatus was not markedly dif-
ferent from that in nickel. There are some rather puzzling
aspects of the data obtained as the amount of 23! Pa added
was approximately 5.4 mg and a maximum of 1.5 mg was found
in the melt, based on filtered samples. About 3.4 mg were
recovered from the apparatus at the conclusion of the experi-
ment. The results suggest that it may be more difficult to
achieve complete solution of protactinium by hydrofluorina-
tion treatment in copper apparatus than in nickel but this

cannot be regarded as a firm conclusion.
