* REVIEW OF MOLTEN SALT REACTOR PHYSICS CALCULATIONS
1. INTRODUCTION

** This review of the physics of the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor was
undertaken for the purpose of providing an independent check of as many
aspects as possible of the calculations already made. We have not at-
tempted any further optimization. Instead we chose a design of the core
and blanket regions for which calculations had already been meade, and
subjected this design to our analysis. Our primary interest was in the
breeding ratio of the equilibrium reactor. i

The design we chose is essentiglly the one presented as the refer-
ence case in ORNL-TM-1467 (Ref. 1). It is a 1000 Ma(e) power plant with
a single’ core, separate fissile end fertile streams, and without pro-
vision for removal of 233p, from the fertile stream. Ce

‘The previous celculation for this design is known as Case 555 in &
series of calculations by the OPTIMERC code. Insofar as possible we

"attempted to specify the same geometry and composition as case 555,

resisting suggestions that this cease is already obsolete, so that a
valid ‘comparison could be made between’ the two calculations. For some
regions, particularly for the “lower blanket and plenum, ‘the’ specifice-
tions for case 555 were not detailed enough for our calculations, or
appeared to leave out certain: components. To £111 in these gaps we
obtained. additional layout drawings and dimensions from the ‘group “work-

.ing on the design of the molten salt reactors. ©

- Our review covered six ‘principal areas: Cross section selection,

fission product treatment, miltigroup cell calculatims, two-dimensional
“reactor criticality calculations, equilibrium depletion calculations,
end stert up depletion calculations. In each area ve attempted to choose
methods and date which vere as independent as possible from those used Co
‘previously. ‘However, in & number of instances we used ‘the ‘same methods
‘because alternate computer codes were not available, and’ for ‘many nuclides
we used essentially the seme ‘cross ‘section data because > they seemed most

likely to be correct.
The cross sections selected were mainly those that have been as-
sembled over a period of years for use in reactor evaluation studies.

We reviewed carefully the situation with regard to 233, whose cross
sections always turn out to be the most important. single factor in deter-
mining the neutron economy of thorium cycle reactors. We also reviewed
the data for several other nuclides which are important to the MSER.
These included Tra Id, bra, Be, F, C," and Th.

We revieved the fission product chains and chose to treat 32 nuclides
explicitly in each of the fluid streams. The remainder of the fission
products which were lumped together as a single pseudo-element gave a
total fractional absorption of 0.005 per neutron absorbed in fuel. .

Our basic cross section set consists of the 68 energy group library
for the M-GAM code, used to generate broad-group cross sections above |
© 1.86 ev; plus the 30 group library for the THERMOS code, from which the
broad group cross sections below 1.86 ev are obtained. The M-GAM cal-
culetion gives a spectrum for the typical reactor cell and averages the.
cross sections over this cell. The heterogeneity of the cell for neutron
energies above 30 kev was taken into account by & separate trangport cal-
culation of the flux distribution within the cell. sh gag elding and
heterogeneity effects in the resonances of 233p,, 23 u, 236, and Th were
computed in the M-GAM code by the Adler, Hinman, and —— (narrow
resonance approximation) method. The THERMOS calculation gives an in-
tegral-transport solution to the group fluxes in a one-dimensional repre-
sentation of the cell, and. averages the cross sections over the spectrum
end over the cell. In the M-GAM-THERMOS calculations we reduced the
cross sections to a set consisting of five fast groups end four thermal
groups. We did one celculetion for the nuclides in a core cell and a
second one for the blanket region. - The previous calculations had also
employed the M-GAM-THERMOS code but had included somewhat different ap-
proximations as to cell geometry, particularly with regard to the hetero-
geneity in the resonance absorption by - the thorium.

We mede & two-dimensional nine-group calculation .of the entire
reactor using the microscopic cross sections calculated by the M-GAM-
THERMOS code and. the nuclide densities specified for the reference e case.

This celculation vas done with the ASSAULT code. Considerable effort

was made to represent realistically all of the blanket areas, structure,

reflectors, end pressure vessel, es well es the core. The previous cal-
culations mede use of the MERC code which synthesizes the flux distri-
bution from one-dimensional calculations in the redisl and axiasl direc-
tions. After determining the multiplication factor for the specifed
core composition, we changed the 2334 concentration to obtain criticality.
With this calculation we could examine the neutron balance for the vartous
regions and the power. distribution. | - |
Using the reattion rates (one-group microscopic cross sections)
obtained in the ASSAULT code calculation we did. en equilibrium. point-
depletion calculation. We. used the LTM code, modified to do celculations

of separate fertile and fissile streams with trensfer of bred fuel from

the fertile. to the fissile stream, to celculate processing lose end fuel
removal besed on average ‘concentrations, and to give: specified cycle

times. Fram the calculation with this code’ ve obteined the equilibrium

cycle neutron balance and the equilibrium breeding ratio. The cycle
times for fissile and fertile ‘streams, end the removal rates associated
with reprocessing were taken from TM-1467. “Previous calculations hed

used the MERC. code to .obtein this equilibrium neutron balance.

To check the" ‘assumption that the performance of the reactor can be
adequately represented by an: equilibrium cycle, we also. calculated the

heavy-element concentrations fore 30-year reactor history, starting with
93% 23y - 14 238; as the inttiel fuel material. No saleutations. of this

type had been done previously.

2. SUMMARY OF RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Summary of Results -

The most significant difference between the results of our calcula-
tions end previous ones was in the reactivity of the reference design.
Using the reference composition we obtained a x off of 0.95. An additional
1g 233y wes required to achieve criticality, Yolding all other concen-
tretions constent. The discrepancy in opr is entirely traceable to the
values used for thorium resonance integrel. We calculated the resonance
integral for the geometry of the reference design and obtained 36.5 barns.
In the OPTIMERC calculations it had been found convenient to use the seme
resonance integral for all geometries being considered; the value assigned
was 30.1 barns.

Our calculations  egreed with the previous ones to within 0.01 in
breeding ratio as shown in Tebles 2.1 and 2.2. - However, there vere a
number of individual differences of 0.001 to 0.005 in the neutron balance.
An enalysis of same of these is as follows: : | -

Since the cross sections had been

calculated with a composition which gave & harder spectrum than the

The total

result for the 1.0of 233y was an. increase of 0.002 in breeding ratio for

our celculations compered to the previous ones.

2. The average 7 of 23%y vas 1.971 compared with 1. 958 in the
previous calculations. We believe that the new cross sections ere
likely to be better for this nuclide. The result was an increase in
breeding: ratio of 0. 001. CT

3. We used a lover Cross. ‘ection for 234; in accordance. with the
recommendations of the latest edition of BNL-325. As a consequence,
more of the 23ky was removed with the excess urenium, and there were
fewer ebsorptions in 23% , 236, y end’ 2p. ‘The net result’ appears
to have been an increase in airs ratio of Less. than 0.001.

L, we did not include any 238 production in our calculation
‘since : it did not seem appropriate. Any other trens-uraniun isotopes
‘beyond 23% should not lead to a net’ loss since they could probably
be separated end sold if there were eny tendency for them od Secumlete:.
An increase in breeding ratio of 0.001 resulted.

5. Parasitic ebsorptions in carrier salt (other than 61) were |
‘lower because of the increased fissile loading in our esleuletion.. An
increase of 0.003 in breeding ratio occured. ..

6. Perasitic absorptions in n graphite vere lover for the seme reason.

An increase of 0.004 occured.

.T. The previous calculetions omitted the INOR tubes. in the ‘lower
blanket. Although there is a. possibility of reducing the effect by
redesign, the current design gave a breeding ratio loss of O. 005 to
sbsorptions in the INOR. oo Co ae

8. Our calculations gave an increase in breeding ratio of 0. 003
from lower fission product ebsorption. About one-half of this difference
came from puclides which were allowed to ‘recycle in the OPTIMERC celcula-
tion ‘elthough belonging to chemical groups which’ are actually ‘thought. to
‘be removed in reprocessing. It may be that the previoiis calculations
vere justified in introducing & measure of conservatism at this point.’
| The remainder of the difference is associated with the higher fissile

inventory in our calculations. Co .

- 9. The previous calculations ‘used: & he content in the makeup of :
99.997% together with a cost of $120 per kg. In reviewing the basis for
this choice we find that the published AEC price schedule is for 99.990%

Tra at this price.t ‘More recently it has been concluded by those working

‘on molten salt reactor design that it would be reasonsble to assume that

99.995% T14 could be obtained in large quentities et $120 per kg.2 We
have followed this latter assumption and used 99:995% TL4 in our celcu-
lations, leading to a decrease in breeding ratio of 0.002. In addition,
the previous calculations neglected the production of bra in the core
from n,Q reactions in beryllium. . ‘This source of bra, gave ‘an additional
0.003 ‘decrease in breeding ratio.

10. We obtained a 10% higher ‘neutron production from the. Be(n, 2n)
reaction than in the previous calculations. The difference came from:
our taking into account the heterogeneity of the cell in the high-energy
range. The effect on breeding ratio was an increase of about 0.001.

Although our calculations geve a net increase in breeding ratio of
elmost 0.01 compared to the previous ones, it should be kept in mind
thet this increase in breeding ratio vas accompanied by-an increase in
fissile inventory. Indeed, the increese in breeding ratio is about what.
one. would expect from the change in fissile inventory alone, so that
other increases and. decreases have epproximately cancelded. A subsequent
re-optimization would probably lead to a somewhat lover breeding retio
and lower inventory. Sn . Se

The power distributions obtained in the two-dimensional ASSAULT
calculations agreed very closely with those of the one-dimensional OPTIMERC
calculations (Table 2.1) with the exception of a slight increase near
the. ‘central control channel vhich was not included in the OPTTMERC cal-
culations. :

When the reactor was started up on 235. fuel, ‘sale of fuel started
one four months because the inventory requirements are less for 233,
than for 235, The breeding retio was above unity after 18 months, al-

: though same isotopes did not approach their equilibrium value for about
10 years. The 30-year present-valued fuel cycle cost was only 0.02 mills/
kwhr(e). higher than the equilibrium fuel cycle cost. The 30-year average
of ‘the ‘breeding ratio was 0.013 lower than the equilibrium value.

‘Recommendations

The OPTIMERC calculations have. clearly provided ) velusble and
reasonably ‘accurate assesment of: the design configuration for the molten
salt reactor. However, based on the results of our independent calcula-
tions, we believe that there are several points on which & more precise
treatment of the physics would help future optimization studies. These
points are listed below, roughly in the order of their importance. oo

1. The OPTIMERC code should be.provided with a means of verying
the thorium resonance cross sections as fertile stream concentration
end geometry are changed. It is not likely to prove sufficient to re-
calculate the fissile (or fertile) loading for criticality of the final
reference design since the optimizetion procedure is affected in a com- !

plex manner by gross changes in cross eections.

. 2. Optimization of the thicknesses of the: axial and rediel blankets
should be rechecked using a calculational model that egrees with a two-~
"dimensional ASSAULT calculation for a base case. Co |

| 3. The 6p production from beryllium should be. included. Another
look at the 614 concentration in the makeup lithium may be in order,

 elthough this is edmittedly en area in which ‘high precision is not possible.

L. Our cross sections for 23hy end 235y are probably better than

those previously used and should be considered in future celculations.

5. It would be desirable if OPTIMERC could be modified to allow
multiple thermal groups, particularly so that a more correct calculation
could be made of the 1 of 2 U as a function of fuel composition. As
in the case with the thorium cross sections, the optimization cannot be

| carried out successfully if this veristion is not built in to the code. -

If it is too difficult to provide for multiple thermal groups, then it
may be prefersble to reduce the thermal cut-off from 1.86 ev to about
1.0 ev. Ce - ;
6. Heterogeneity effects should be included in the high energy
region. - : SI

As an added comment, it would be in order in the future for the
reference design, as given by OPTIMERC, “to. be checked by a complete
calculation in which the cross section reduction is redone for the re-
ference composition, .

3. CROSS SECTIONS

For the most pert the cross sections used both in this review and
in previous molten salt breeder reactor design studies are the seme.
The cross section data used have been accumulated over a period of ebout
five years and regularly used for reactor evaluation studies. In this
regard they have proven to be reasonably accurate in camparison with
experiments and calculations by others. A summary of the basic thermal
neutron cross section date used in this review end their experimental
sources are given in Teble 3.1. Table 3.2 lists the resonance fission
end absorption integrals end the date sources for the same nuclides.

There are some small differences between the thermal neutron cross
sections for some nuclides in this review and in the previous design
studies. These differences are primarily a result of the issuance of
Supplement II of ENL-325 (Ref. 1) which recommends some renormalization
of previously accepted cross section values. The differences ere shown
in Teble 3.3. Of these differences only those in 233g, 235 and 23h
ere significent in the MSER and leed to a slightly higher breeding ratio.
The use of 2200 n/sec v of 2.503 rather than 2.500 for 23% is con--
sistent with the BNL-325 (Ref. 1) recomended value for the prompt v
of 2.497 £ 0.008 and a delayed neutron fraction of 0.00264. The § of
2.295 at 2200 m/sec for 2335 4s within the uncertainty range for this
nuclide although not necessarily more accurate than the value of 2.292
used in the previous calculations. ]

The 23%y 2200 m/sec date have been renormalized as recommended in
BNL-325, the primary result being a slightly higher a (0.175 vs O. 17k) ’
a higher thermal -v (2. 442 vs 2.430), end a resulting slightly higher
n (2. 078 vs 2. 070). The 10 barn difference in the 23k U thermal cross
gection makes & significent difference in the equilibrium concentrations

of 23% ana 23%. |

The Brown St. John? heavy-ges model was used for the scattering
kernel for all nuclides except carbon both in this review end in the
previous design studies. For carbon the crystalline model es developed
by Parks > vas employed. For the review calculations all kernels were
computed for an average temperature of 900°K: This tempersture was based

Lk, FISSION PRODUCT TREATMENT

The MERC calculation includes ~125 fission product nuclides in ex-
plicit chains. However, many of these nuclides make extremely small
contributions to the overall fission product poison fraction. To facili-
tate our ASSAULT end LTM calculations, it eppeared desirable to include
these small contributions in one or more pseudo-elements, with only the
more important nuclides being treated explicitly.

The long fission product treatment used in the advanced converter
study (ORNL- 3686) was chosen as the basic "complete" fission product

‘description. This:description is pictured in Fig. 4.1.

Since the fluid-fuel system in the MSER allows some of the fission
products to be stripped as gases or be removed in fuel processing, the
above treatment needs to be modified to include those effects. The
modifications made are discussed below. Co

1. Concentration of 135 is determined by the assumption

of 0.005 poison fraction. Fission yleld fraction does

‘not enter the celculation.
2. The poison fractions for these nuclides were obtained

from ASSAULT celculetions using the concentrations from

Teble 2.2. This poison fraction wes then used as input
to time dependent calculations.

Those nuclides which are not included explicitly and which are not
assumed to be removed instantly by plating out or gas stripping are placed
in one of three lumped pseudo-elements, which ere described below.

1. Pseudo-element No. 1. Includes those: nuclides which are removed
by fluoride-volatility during fuel reprocessing.

2. Pseudo-element No. 2. Includes those nuclides which are removed
by vacuum distillation during fuel reprocessing.

3.  Pseudoeelement No. 3. Includes those nuclides which ere removed
only by discarding some of the carrier salt.

The properties of these pecudo-eleneuts are listed in Teble k.2 below.

5 CELL CALCULATIONS

~The infinite-medium code M-GAM was used to calculate spectra and to So
obtain energy-evereged cross sections for neturons from 10 Mev to 1.86 ev.
Two of these celculetions were made, one for the typical core cell, shown
- in Fig. 5.1 and the other for a homogeneous cell representing the blenket
composition. Two subsidiery calculations vere done first to provide input
-information for the M-GAM celculetion: e calculation of high energy intre-
cell flux ratios and & calculetion of effective chord length for the
resonance absorbers. The intra-cell flux ratios were obtained for the
energy groups between 10 Mev and 30 kev, by means of a one-dimensional -
celculation of the cell in 8), approximation to the trensport equation.
The code ANISN was used. Thirty group cross sections were obtained through
use of GAM-II to reduce the 94 group librery date. The cell was approxi~
meted by a series of concentric ennuli es shown in Fig. 5.2 and described
in Tebles 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3. The calculated ratios of region flux to
cell flux are shown in Teble 5.4. The velues eppeering in Teble 5.4 were
averaged by volume and density to obtain the proper factors for input by.
nuclide to the M-GAM calculation.

The effective resonance integrals for the resonance absorbers are
calculated in the M-GAM code by means of the narrow resonance and 1afinite
mass epproximations. Heterogeneity effects are accounted for vy specifying
the effective chord length of e sphere, infinite cylinder, or infinite
celeb which gives the same collision probabilities as the actual region
containing the resonance sbsorber. Since the fissile end fertile stream
* regions of tke MSER cell (Figure 5.1) do not correspond to & lattice of
‘one of these simple shapes, & calculation of the collision probabilities
was required. We used e three-dimensional Monte Carlo code in which the
neutron histories were started with random position and direction within
the material for which the collision probebility wae to be calculated.
~ The fraction having a first collision in each of the materials was computed
for several values of its total cross section. ~The fissile stream regions
in the core cell corresponded to an infinite cylinder with redius of 2.87
% 0.07 em with 95% confidence. This value was used for the isotopes,

The atamic densities of ‘the pure streams (Table 5. 3) were volume
weighted to obtain the mixture densities for the M-GAM calculation. The
resonance materials vere assumed to be at 900°K. Five group cross sec-
tions vere generated by M-GAM. These groups were &s follows: 10 Mev to
0.821 Mev, 0.821 Mev to O. 0318 Mev, 31.8 kev to 1. 23h kev, 1234 ev to

Figure 5.3 ghows the epithermel neutron spectra as calculated by
M-GAM for the blanket and core cells. The outstanding features of these
curves are “the dips in the lethargy range 2.5 to 6 end 10-5 to 13. The
behavior in the range 2.5 to 6 may be explained on the basis of scattering

resonances in fluorine. An inelsstic resonance corresponds to the first

of these dips and elastic resonances to the second and third dips. The
behavior in the lethargy range from 10.5 to 13 is caused by thorium
absorption. Thorium has four large resonances which correspond in lethargy
to the four dips appearing in this renge. The fluctuations are alweys
much more pronounced in the blanket celculetion than in the cell calcule-
tion because the average densities of fluoi-ine and thorium ere much greater
in the blanket than in the core.

THERMOS is & one-dimensional integral transport code which calculates
the scalar thermal neutron spectrum as a function of position. ‘The basic
THERMOS data consists of a thirty group library tepe. These fine groups
are then averaged over the spectrum and over the cell to obtain broad
group cross sections. In the present calculations four broad group thermal
cross sections were generated with energy limits as follows: ‘0.005 ev to
0.06 ev, 0.06 ev to 0.18 ev, 0.18 ev to 0.77 ev and 0.77 ev to 1.86 ev.

The one-dimensional geometry of THERMOS makes necessary the descrip-
tion of the cell as a series of concentric snnuler rings. The core cell
description for THERMOS was identical to that previously described for

~ ANISN with. one exception.’ Experience has shown that to obtain proper

fluxes in THERMOS the unit cell should be enclosed in a region celled a
heavy scatterer. This region consists of a heavy nuclide whose only
reaction is scattering. The unit cell as shown in Fig. 5.2 end described
in Tables 5.1, 5.2, and o> 3 was ‘enclosed in such a region for the THERMOS
calculation.

The temperature of all materials 1n the cell end the plenket was
essumed to be 900°K. ps

The spatial variation of the flux in two of the fine. groups is shown
in Fig. 5.4 (energies of 0.02-0.03 ev and 0.07-0.08 ev). The spatial
veriation is clearly quite small. Fig. 5.5 shows the energy distribution
of the average flux for the cell and blanket calculations.

6. TWO-DIMENSIONAL CALCULATIONS

The reactor was described in R-Z geometry as shown in Fig. 6.1.

(AL dimensions on this figure are in feet.) Forty-eight mesh lines
were used in the radial direction and 67 exielly. The region compositions
are listed in Table 6.1 and the:main core densities are listed in Table
6.2. Region 11, the center control rod, wes treated as a typical fuel
cell (Figure 5.1) with the fuel stream replaced by grephite. In the
lower axiel blanket (region 12), each fuel tube wes considered to be
100% INOR-8 between the core and the lower plenum. Region 18 is a
vacuum region which 1¢ used to impose a "black" boundary condition on
the edjacent fuel and INOR bounderies. Region 19 is en annulus of fuel
representing the four sets of entrance end exit fuel pipes at the bottom
of the reactor. Where possible, reactor dimensions and volume fractions
were made the same &s in the previous calculations (case 555).

The Pine-group neutron diffusion equations were solved with the
ASSAULT code.} A value of kepr = 0.95 was obtained. The decrease in
keps Of 0.05 compared to the previous calculations is entirely attribut--
eble to & 21% higher thorium resonance integrel used in our calculations.

A fuel search calculation vas then made on the 233y concentration
in the fuel stream until the reactor was Just critical. A 233 concen-
tration increase of 13.9% was required to raise kore to unity. A region-
by-region neutron balence for the critical configuration is given in
Teble 6.3. Only sbout 0.006 of the absorptions per fissile sbsorption
occur outside the surrounding blankets, indicating optically thick blankets.
In fact, the exisl leskage 1s so small that the axial blankets could be
made somewhat thinner without effecting the neutron economy. However, |
ebout 0.005 neutrons ebsorbed in the lower exiel blanket ere captured
by INOR. This loss in breeding ratio might be avoided if it is possible
to extend the graphite fuel tubes below the core about 6-12 in. before
meking the transition to INOR. : -

The power density is very nearly in a Jo distribution radially and
& cosine distribution axially, as shown in Fig. 6.2 end 6.3. The radial
distribution corresponds to the mid-plane of the core, end the exiasl tra-

verse was made near the center of the core at r= 17 cm. Power densities

were normalized to the average core power density, 2.48 x 1012 fission/
cm3 sec (at 200 Mev/fission). The radial peeking near the center of

the core results from the replacement of fuel with graphite in the

centrel graphite fuel cell. The peek power density, P/F = = 3. 29, occurs

at the core mid-plane adjacent to the central graphite cell, The redial
“and axial peeking factors are 2.18 end 1.51, respectively. If the redial
power distribution is extrepolated to avoid peeking effects due to the
central element treatment, P/F = 3. 08. These velues are to be compared

© with rediel, exisl, and total peaking factors from previous work (case
555) of 2.22, 1.37, and 3.04, respectively. At the radisl end upper
exiel core-blenket interfaces, the power density drops off very rapidly
because of the sudden decrease in fuel concentration in the blankets. How-
ever, fuel does flow up through the lower axial blanket » end power genera-
tion extends bout 10 cm below the core boundary as defined in Fig. 6.1.

7. DEPLETION CALCULATIONS

The previous celculations used the MERC code which obtains equilibrium
reaction rates and equilibrium concentrations automatically. The concen-
trations are. obtained from the ERC portion of. MERC which solves directly
the coupled ‘equations of the equilibrium condition for e circulating fuel
regctor. Since we wished to make an independent check on the validity
of the solution, and had no other code aveilsble which solves the seme
problem, we made extensive modifications to en existing code. We took
the ITM code, which does & multigroup point-depletion calculation of the
equilibrium cycle for a solid-fuel reactor, and changed it to do a one-
group, point-depletion calculation of the fluid fuel cycle. This required
thet the code use average stream densities for losses end removals, thet
it permit specification of separate cycle times for the two streams, and
that the nuclide chains be modified to include all of those discussed in
section 4 of this report.

We used the one-group cross sections (microscopic reaction rates)
obtained from the ASSAULT calculation for each nuclide in each stream.

The removal of fission products was treated as indicated in section ky,
Losses of uranium isotopes were assumed to be 0.001 per reprocessing
cycle, loss of 233pe vas assumed to be 0.00001 per cycle, and 23x ves
assumed to be: removed completely each cycle. Complete transfer of uranium

isotopes from the fertile to the fissile stream at the end of each fertile .

stream cycle was assumed.

Teble 7.1 gives the resulting neutron balence. The gross (nuclear)
breeding ratio is 1.062 compared with 1.054 previously obtained (ORNL-
TM-1467, celculated from Table 8).

Previous calculations have made the tacit assumption that the equilib-
rium fuel cycle can be used to represent the reactor history though it
is known that some molten salt reactors might have to be started up on
& uranium fully enriched in 23%.

In order to check the validity of the equilibrium assumption, we did
a time-dependent depletion calculation for the heavy nuclides over e 30-
year reactor history, starting with & 93% 23% - % 238; fuel. We held
the thorium concentration constent and varied the fissile concentration to

QC.

maintain eriticality. Leakage and parasitic absorptions were held con-
stent at the values determined by the LIM calculation, and the heavy
nuclide reaction rates were obtained from the ASSAULT celculetions. We
essumed complete removal of plutonium isotopes on each cycle.

Figures 7.1, 7.2 end 7.3 give a picture of the epproach to equilib-
rium. The net breeding ratio, as ‘defined in Fig. 7.3, is the quantity
of fissionable materiel produced less the emount lost divided by the
smount consumed in nuclear reactions. . This quantity reached on equilib-
rium value of 1.054 and was 1.041 when aversged over the 30-year history.
It 1s noteworthy that sale of surplus fissionable materials started after
only four months of operation, elthough the breeding ratio did not reach
unity until after about two years of operation. The difference of one
and one-half years was caused by & reduction of fissile inventory to
meintein criticality as the reactor shifted from 2355 to 233y. It showld
also be noted that tne 236y concentration went through e& maximum early
in the reactor life and then decreased following the 23%y concentration
decresse instead of gradually building up toward equilibrium as fre-
quently assumed. -

A good measure of the suitability of equilibrium celculations is the
comparison of present-valued costs over the 30-year history with those
for the equilibrium cycle. These are shown in Teble 7.2, with the fuel
yield and inventories teken from our calculations, and the other costs
from ORNL- TM-1467.% oo

The equilibrium cycle calculation was based on a value of $14 per : \<'
gm for 233% and 233pe end $12 per gn for 235g. The interest rate was
10%. The 30-year cycle was calculated on & cash-flow basis with the
same unit costs and a 6% discount factor. The "other costs" were taken
from ORNL-TM-1467.1 a
