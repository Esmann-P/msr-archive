THERMAL STRESS ANALYSIS OF THE ART HEAT EXCHANGER
CHANNELS AND HEADER PIPES

 
  
    

This report summarizes the study which was made to determine the
stresses; deflections, and the forces and moments acting on the ART
heat exchanger channels and header pipes due to relative thermal expan-

sion between the channels and the pressure shell at full power operation.

Introduction

Figure 1 shows a sketch of a channel and header pipes, and a portion
of the pressure shell to which they are connected. During full power
operation the temperature of the channel will be higher than that of the
pressure shell, and thereby produce relative thermal expansion. The
resulting forces and moments will cause deformation of the channel, the
header pipes, and the thermal sleeves which connect the pipes to the pres-
sure shell. The stresses due to these loads will be transmitted to the
incoming NaX piping.

Figure 2 shows the idealized system used for the analysis. The
channel was treated as a semi-circular-arc curved-beam connected directly
to the header pipes, which were treated as cantilever beams. This analysis
assumes that there is no deformation in the incoming NaK piping, or in the -
thermal sleeves. It is expected that this assumption will yield an ade-
quate initial estimate for the analysis of the channel.

Because of symmetry it was sufficient to consider only one-half of
the channel and one header pipe. The channel was assumed fixed at the

mid-point and the deflections due to the relative thermal expansion were

applied to the system. Elastic theory was assumed for all calculations.

Thermal Expansions

The total vertical expansion of the channel relative to the
pressure shell was reported in ART Design Memo 8-D-5 as 82 mils.
This was assumed to be distributed equally between the sections
above and below the mid-point, so that 41 mils was the vertical
deflection used in the calculations.

For the radial expansion, the channel was assumed to be at an
average temperature of 1425°F and the pressure shell at 12Lo°F,
Taking the radial position of the header pipes to be 19.59 inches,
this gives a radial deflection of 32 mils,

Method of Analysis

Deflection equations were written to determine the forces and

moments acting on the channel at point b, from the thermal expansions

applied between points a and c. The coordinate system is shown in
Fig. 3. Since the channel is free to grow radially, forces were not
applied in the y-direction. The modes of deformation included in-
plane and out-of-plane bending of the channel from flexure and torsi
and deformation of the header pipe by flexure and torsion.

The deflections for point b due to deformation and rotation of

on

the

channel may be expressed by the following equations, in which the sub-

scripts refer to the modes of deflection.

The relative thermal expansions applied between points a and c
must be equal to the differences in the deflections of point b caused
by deformations of the channel and those caused by deformations of the
header pipe. Hence, the following relations may be written, in which
the subscripts T and H refer to the applied relative thermal expansions

and the deflections due to deformation of the header pipe, respectively’.

By expressing the deflections in Eqs (6) through (10) in terms of
the loads acting on the channel at point b, a set of equations results
from which these loads may be determined. Since the rigid body rotation
of the plane of the channel about the y-axis is an unknown in addition
to the five loads Fos Fs Ms Mv, and M, an additional equation is re-

quired, and may be written by summing moments about the y-axis.

Deflections From In-Plane Bending of Channel

It is seen from Fig. 3; that the force and moment producing in-
plane bending of the channel are P and Myo These may be resolved into

forces and moments parallel to the coordinate axes.

the x and z directions. Note also that the deformation of the header
pipe in the z direction has been neglected.

Solution of Deflection Equations

written in terms of coefficients 8177 through 8167 as follows:

‘ L, Note that the distance from the origin to b has been denoted by ob

instead of r. Since the channel is not circular, the actual distances
have been used in Eqs (38) and (39) instead of an average radius. The
discrepancy involved here is small since ob = 24.1 inches and r has been

taken as 21.9.

This result indicates that the channel will expand 37 mils towards Shell V,
at the equator, in addition to the free relative thermal expansion reported
in ART Design Memo 8-D-5.

Since there are no forces on the channel in the y-direction, the y-
deflection at b, relative to the actual coordinate system, is zero.

The x-deflection at b can be calculated by summing the in-plane and
cut-of-plane x-deflections for the channel, or from the deflection of the

header pipe. Taking the latter, and using Eq (LO),

Thermal stresses are produced in the header pipe Prom radial
and axial temperature gradients, in addition to those caused by relative
thermal expansion of the channel. Figure 6 shows the north and south
headers and pipes with the approximate temperatures of the surrounding
fluids.

The axial temperature gradients should be small except in the
regions close to the headers which are subjected to cross-flow from the
fuel, Because of the azimuthal variation in heat transfer coefficients
and the complicated geometry of these regions, it is possible that
thermal cycling of these small sections of pipe could occur. Although
these temperature fluctuations would be difficult to calculate, small
thermal shields welded to the headers might be warranted.

Because the layer of fuel surrounding the header pipes over most
of their lengths is very thin, an estimate of the radial temperature
profiles may be calculated using simple conduction with semi-infinite
slab geometry. With the temperatures indicated in Fig. 6, these cal-
culations give temperature differences across the walls of 23% and 32°F
for the north and south header pipes, respectively. The stresses in

the outside walls due to these gradients can be calculated by

giving - L574 psi for the north header pipe, and 6176 psi for the south.
The bending and twisting stresses may now be combined with the

stresses due to the radial temperature gradient in the header pipe in

order to get the maximum normal and shear stresses. Figure 7 shows

the fixed end of the header pipe, the direction of the resultant bending

moment, and the bending stresses due to Myre Since the twisting stresses

For the south header, the temperature gradient stresses are tensile

wise from the negative y-axis, when the south header pipe is oriented

Evaluation of Torsional Rigidity Factor, K

For a narrow rectangular beam of length b and width c, XK can be

approximated using the membrane analogy to give

K = 3 be (B1)

9

Similarly, for a narrow trapezoidal section”,

1 2 2
K = 55 b,(cy + c,)(cy + c;) (B2)

For a cross-section built up of narrow elements, K can be
approximated by summing the K's for the individual elements™C,
Thus, for the channel (Fig. 4), by summing two trapezoidal sections

and one rectangle,

CN z b, (cg + ep)(cs + 2) (B3)
