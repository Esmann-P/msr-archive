DESIGN STUDY OF A HEAT-EXCHANGE SYSTEM
FOR ONE MSBR CONCEPT

Abstract

The heat-exchange system for one concept of a 1000-Mw(e)
nuclear power plant using a molten-salt breeder reactor has
been studied. The system has five types of heat exchangers
to transfer the heat generated in the reactor core to the
supercritical steam energy required to drive the turbine for
the generation of electrical power. The two major design
approaches reported here are for flow circuits in which heat
is transferred from the molten core fuel and fertile blanket
salts to the molten coolant salt and then to the supercriti-
cal fluid. The Case-A system involves relatively high fuel-
and blanket-salt pressures in the reactor core. These pres-
sures are reduced in the Case-B system by reversal of the
flows of the fuel and blanket salts through the reactor core
and the respective pumps and exchangers, while the operating
pressures of the coolant-salt system are raised above those
in the Case-A system, The criteria used, assumptions made,
relationships employed, and the results obtained in the de-
sign for each of: the five types of exchangers used in these
cases are reported. Although the resulting design for the
Case-B heat-exchange system and the exchangers appears to
be the most workable one, further experimental and analytical
investigations are needed before the designs for these ex-
changers can be finalized.

1. INTRODUCTION

Thermal-energy molten-salt breeder reactors (MSBR) are being studied
to assess their economic and nuclear performance and to identify important
design problems. One such study made at Oak Ridge National Laboratory
(ORNL) was of a conceptual 1000-Mw(e) MSBR power plant. The initial
reference design for this plant employs a molten-salt breeder reactor

with a two-region fluid-fuel concept that has fissile material in the

core stream and fertile material in the blanket stream. This study
encompassed all of the major equipment required for a complete power
station, including the components of the heat-exchange system. The
design studies for the heat exchangers are presented here in greater
detail to document some of the unique considerations involved in the
transfer of heat between different molten-salt systems and between
molten salt and water or steam.

The reference 1000-Mw (e) plant? has four heat-exchange loops, and
the design for this heat-exchange system is referred to here as Case A.
Five types of heat exchangers are used in this system to accomplish the
two principal transfers of heat: (1) from the fuel and blanket salts to
the coolant salt and (2) from the coolant salt to supercritical fluid.
After an evaluation of this concept was made, the possibility of improv-
ing the system by changing the operating pressures of the fuel-, blanket-,
and coolant-salt systems became apparent. The resulting design for a
reverse-flow system with lower fuel- and blanket-salt pressures in the
reactor core and higher operating pressures in the coolant-salt system
is presented here as Case B. Because of the possibility of developing
a coolant salt with a lower and more favorable freezing-point tempera-
ture, another modification of the Case-A system was considered briefly.
This is referred to as the Case-C design. The design criteria, assump-
tions, calculatory procedures, and the resulting design data are dis-
cussed for each of the five types of exchangers in these heat-exchange

systems.

2. SUMMARY

In the Case-A design of the heat-exchange system for the reference
1000-Mw(e) MSBR power plant, five types of heat exchangers are used in
each of the four heat-exchange loops. Each loop has one primary fuel-
salt-to-coolant-salt exchanger, one blanket-salt exchanger, four boiler
superheater exchangers, two steam reheater exchangers, and two reheat-
steam preheaters to transfer the heat in the fuel and blanket salts to
the coolant salt and from the coolant salt to the supercritical fluid.

The fuel salt circulates through graphite tubes in the reactor core
with a maximum pressure of 95 psi, leaves the core, and passes through
the primary exchanger where some of its heat is transferred to the cool-
ant salt. Upon leaving the primary exchanger, the fuel salt enters the
suction side of the fuel-salt pump and is discharged back to the reactor
core. The blanket salt circulates through the reactor core outside the
graphite tubes with a maximum pressure of 115.8 psi. Upon leaving the
core, it passes through the blanket-salt exchanger to release some of its
heat to the coolant salt, enters the suction side of the blanket-salt
pump, and is discharged back to the reactor.

Coolant salt is circulated through the primary exchanger and the
blanket-salt exchanger in series. A major portion (87%) of the coolant
salt is then circulated through the boiler superheater exchangers where
its heat is released to the supercritical fluid, while a smaller portion
(13%) of the coolant salt is circulated through the reheaters. Reheat -
steam preheaters are required in the steam system to raise the tempera-
ture of the exhaust steam from the high-pressure turbine before it enters
the reheaters. | oo

A modification of the Case-A design that would eliminate the need
for the reheat-steam preheaters and for direct-contact heating of the
supercritical fluid before it enters the boiler superheaters was consid-
ered briefly. Case C involves lowering the inlet temperatures of the
steam reheaters and the boiler superheaters to study the effects of a
coolant salt with a lower freezing-point temperature.

As the studies progressed and more understanding of the overall

system was obtained, the fact that the pressure of the fuel salt is

 
 

 

A}

)
4)

higher than that of the coolant salt at the same point in the primary
exchanger and the relatively high pressures of the molten salts in con-

tact with graphite in the reactor core caused concern. The Case-B system

 

was developed to obtain a more desirable pressure arrangement.

In the Case-B system, the operating pressures of the coolant-salt
system were raised to assure that any leakage in the overall system
would be from the coolant-salt system into the fuel- or blanket-salt
systems. To lower the pressure on the graphite tubes in the reactor core
and keep salt penetration at a minimum, the flows of the fuel and blanket
salts through the reactor core and the respective pumps and exchangers are
reversed from those in Case A. The result is that the maximum pressure
of the fuel salt in the reactor core is 18 psi, and the maximum pressure
of the blanket salt is 32.5 psi.

The Case-B heat-exchange system involved redesign of the primary,
blanket-salt, boiler superheater, and steam reheater exchangers. The
design for the Case-B primary exchanger is an improvement over that for
Case A because the expansion bellows was eliminated and differential
thermal expansion between the inner and outer tubes is accommodated by
the use of sine-wave shaped tubes in the inner annulus, The blanket-
salt exchanger was improved in Case B by the addition of a floating head
to accommodate differential thermal expansion between the tubes and shell
and to reduce cyclic fatigue. These improvements seem well suited for

ultimate application in the power-plant heat-exchange system.

Lo»

The design criteria, calculatory procedures, and the results of the

o)

calculations for each type of exchanger are given in this report, and
many of the detailed calculations for the Case-B exchangers are appended.
While no optimization can be claimed for these exchanger designs, we feel
that the concepts are sound and reasonable. However, there are two major
uncertainties in the heat-transfer calculations. Accurate values of the
molten-salt physical constants are not known, and the heat-transfer cor-
relations for our application need further verification. The values for
physical constants and tolerances for values of viscosity, density, and
thermal capacity that we used were provided us by the designers of the
MSBR during the early stages of the study. Recent developments have OW

revealed uncertainties in viscosity and thermal conductivity that could

invalidate the existing designs. Therefore, before final designs for the

heat exchangers can be presented with confidence, experimental investiga-

tions should be made to’

1. accurately determine the physical properties of molten fluoride salts;

2. investigate the heat-transfer properties of molten salts to extend
the work of MacPherson and Yarosh;?

3. check and extend the heat-transfer and pressure-drop equations devel-
oped by Bergelin et al 23 to include disk and doughnut baffles;

4. investigate heat transfer from molten salt to supercritical fluid, in
particular the heat transfer during the transition from pressurized
water to supercritical fluid, if a practical experiment can be devised;

5. determine the tendency of both bent and straight tubes to vibrate
under various conditions of diameter, pitch, support, length, and
baffle shape and spacing; and to

6. determine the possible vibration effects of direct mixing of super-
critical fluid with pressurized water.

Analytical studies should also be made of the

1. possible errors to arrive at the amount of contingency that should be
designed into each exchanger to provide a trustworthy design,

2. cyclic conditions in the system,

3. vibration in each exchanger to assure adequate tube life,
possibility of applying recently developed knowledge of tube config-
urations that enhance heat transfer,

5. loads on exchangers imposed by methods of support and the piping
restraints, and

6. the maintenance considerations.

3. DESIGN APPROACH

The reference design?! for the 1000-Mw(e) MSBR power plant involves
a two-region two-fluid system with the fuel salt and the blanket salt in
the reactor core separated by graphite tubes. The fuel salt consists of
uranium fluoride dissolved in a carrier salt of lithium and beryllium
fluorides, and the blanket salt contains thorium fluoride dissolved in a
similar carrier salt. The energy generated in the reactor fluid is trans-
ferred to a coolant-salt circuit that couples the reactor to a supercrit-
ical steam cycle. This reference design employs one reactor with four
heat-exchange loops.

Since a high plant-availability factor in the power plant is impor-
tant to the maintenance of low power costs, a modular-type design for the
MSBR plant was also considered. This modular plant would have four sep-
arate and identical reactors with their separate salt circuits. The
desirability of the modular-type design and consideration of the size of
the components and pipe required for the reference plant influenced the
selection of the number of heat exchangers to be used in the system.
Regardless of the number of reactors to be used in the 1000-Mw(e) plant,
the study reported here is based on the use of four heat-exchange modules

in the system.

Heat-Exchange System

Each of the four modules or loops of the reference heat-exchange
system contains one primary fuel-salt-to-coolant-salt exchanger, one |
blanket-salt exchanger, four boiler superheater exchangers, two steam
reheater exchangers, and two reheat-steam preheater exchangers. These
exchangers are housed in temperature-controlled shielding cells that can

be heated to temperatures up to 1000°F with either gas or electric

heaters. This simplifies the system considerably by eliminating the need
for auxiliary heaters on each piece of equipment and the need to insulate
each individual component.

The flow diagram of the heat-exchange system for the reference
design, Case A, is shown in Fig. 1. Each heat transfer stage. consists
of a number of identical exchangers represented in Fig. 1 as a single
typical exchanger. The temperature values shown in Fig. 1 constitute
the basis from which development of the designs for the various heat
exchangers was begun. Some of these values were derived from known prop-
erties of molten-salt systems, and some were derived from simple heat
and material balances. Values in the steam system were selected to make
use of the existing steam-cycle design in the Tennessee Valley Authority's
900-Mw(e) Bull Run steam plant. This design was modified to increase the
power rating to 1000 Mw(e).

In the resulting design for the Case-A system, the fuel salt leaving
the reactor core at a pressure of 90 psi enters the primary exchanger at
a temperature of 1300°F and a pressure of 85.8 psi and is circulated
through the tubes in the exchanger where some of its heat is released to

the coolant salt. It then enters the suction side of the fuel-salt pump

and is discharged back to the reactor at a temperature of 1000°F and a

pressure of 95 psi. The heat from the blanket salt is transferred to the
coolant salt in the blanket-salt heat exchanger. The blanket salt leav-
ing the reactor at a pressure of 95.8 psi enters the exchanger at a tem-
perature of 1250°F and a pressure of 90.3 psi, is circulated through the
tubes of the exchanger where some of its heat is given up to the coolant
salt, enters the suction side of the blanket-salt pump, and is discharged
back to the reactor at a temperature of 1150°F and a pressure of 97.8 psi.

These transfers of heat to the coolant-salt system represent one of
the two direct steps involved in converting the heat generated in the

reactor core to the energy required to drive the steam turbine. The

‘coolant salt in the system enters the primary exchanger at a temperature

of 850°F and a pressure of 79.2 psi and leaves it at a temperature of
1111°F and pressure of 28.5 psi. This coolant salt is then circulated
through the blanket-salt exchanger, entering at a temperature of 1111°F

and pressure of 26.5 psi and leaving at a temperature of 1125°F and a

pressure of 9 psi. The second direct heat-conversion step is performed
when the major portion (877%) of the coolant salt is circulated through
the boiler superheater exchangers where its heat is released to the
supercritical fluid.

The remaining portion (13%) of the coolant salt in the system is
used to reheat the exhaust steam from the high-pressure turbine in the
steam reheater exchanger. There is a possibility that the coolant salt
in the steam reheater could be cooled to a temperature too close to its
freezing point by the much cooler steam fed directly from the turbine
exhaust. To avert possible freezing of the coolant salt, a reheat-steam
preheater was included in the system wherein heat from a relatively small
quantity of the high-temperature supercritical fluid raises the tempera-
ture of the reheat steam. For the same reason, the temperature of the
supercritical fluid is raised before it enters the boiler superheaters
by direct-contact heating.

The studies of the MSBR heat-exchange system progressed to a point
where a better evaluation of the temperatures and pressures in the over-
all system could be made. The most objectionable single feature of the
Case-A system is that there are points in the primary heat exchanger
where the pressure of the fuel salt is higher than that of the coolant
salt, particularly where the fuel salt enters at a pressure of 85.8 psi
and the coolant salt exits at a pressure of 28.5 psi. When efforts were
directed toward correcting this feature, other areas where improvements
in the system could be made became evident. The revised design that we
refer to as the Case-B system was developed by the reactor designers to
improve the overall operation of the heat-exchange system. The Case-B
system required the redesign of the primary, blanket-salt, boiler super-
heater, and steam reheater exchangers, and the resulting flow diagram
for the system is shown in Fig. 2.

The operating pressures of the coolant-salt system in the Case-B
design were raised to assure that any leakage in the overall system
would be from the coolant-salt system into the fuel or blanket salt
system. The Case-B system has a further advantage over the Case-A system
in that the pressures of the molten salts in contact with the graphite

tubes in the reactor core are lower. At the top of the reactor where

pressures are at a minimum, the pressure of the fuel salt in the graphite
tubes in the Case-A system is 83.5 psi, while that of the blanket salt
outside the tubes is 95.8 psi. At the bottom of the reactor where the
pressures are maximum, the pressure of the fuel salt is 95 psi and the
corresponding pressure of the blanket salt is 115.8 psi.

In the Case-B system, where the pressures are at a minimum at the
top of the reactor, the pressure of the fuel salt circulating through
the graphite tubes is 6.5 psi, while the pressure of the blanket salt
outside the tubes at that point is 12.5 psi. At the bottom of the reac-
tor where the pressures are maximum, the pressure of the fuel salt is
18 psi and the corresponding pressure of the blanket salt is 32.5 psi.

This lowering of the pressure of the fuel and blanket salts in the
reactor for the Case-B system is accomplished by reversing the flow of
the fuel and blanket salts through the respective pumps and exchangers
and through the reactor core. The fuel salt leaving the reactor core at
a temperature of 1300°F and a pressure of 13 psi enters the suction side
of the fuel-salt pump and is discharged into the primary heat exchanger
at a pressure of 146 psi. It is circulated through the tubes of the
exchanger and then reenters the reactor at a temperature of 1000°F and
a pressure of 18 psi. The blanket salt leaving the reactor core at a

temperature of 1250°F and a pressure of 12.5 psi enters the suction side

‘of the blanket-salt pump and is discharged into the blanket-salt exchanger

at a pressure of 111 psi, It is circulated through the tubes in the

exchanger and then reenters the reactor at a temperature of 1150°F and a

pressure of 14.5 psi.

. To study the effects of having a coolant salt with a lower and more
favorable freezing-point temperature in the system, another modification
of the Case-A heat-exchange system was developed. Case C involves lower-
ing the inlet temperatures of the steam reheaters and the boiler super-
heaters, eliminating the reheat-steam preheaters and the need for direct-
contact heating of the supercritical. fluid before it enters the super-
heaters. The turbine exhaust steam is fed directly to the steam reheaters
at a temperature of 552°F, and the supercritical fluid enters the boiler

superheaters at a temperature of 580°F.

Factors Affecting Design of Heat Exchangers

Several factors other than operating temperatures and pressures also
had to be taken into account before the designs for the various compo-
nents of the heat-exchange system could be developed. Those factors
included consideration of the materials that could be used to construct
the components, the maintenance philosophy to be followed, and the feasi-

bility of the concept as a whole.

Materials

Metal surfaces in frequent contact with molten fluoride salts must
have corrosion resistance not provided by conventional materials. Hastel-
loy N, originally developed as INOR-8 specifically for use with molten
fluoride salts, was designated by the designers of the MSBR as the struc-
tural material for all components in the fuel, blanket, and coolant
systems that are in contact with molten salts.

The preheater and high-temperature steam piping will be made of
Croloy, 2 1/47 chrome and 1% molybdenum. Carbon steel can be used for
those surfaces in contact with water at temperatures below 700°F, as

specified in Section III of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.Z

Maintenance Philosophy

 

Certain features of the designs for the heat exchangers are governed
by the maintenance philosophy to be applied to them. We believe that the
reliability of the exchangers can be held at a high level through quality
control in design and fabrication. Therefore, the maintenance philosophy
we adopted predicates that defective exchangers will be replaced with
new ones rather than being repaired in place. This attitude is neces-

sary for the primary and blanket exchangers because of the high level

of radioactivity that they will incur during operation at full power.
When an exchanger must be removed from its temperature-controlled shield-
ing cell, it will have to be placed .in another shielded cell for an
indefinite period.

Those exchangers that contain no fuel or blanket salt are not likely
to reach as high a level of radioactivity during operation as the primary
and blanket exchangers, but the level reached will probably be high enough
to prevent direct repair in place. If they fail, these exchangers will
also be replaced, and after the required decay time, they will be repaired.
Removal and subsequent repair of the exchangers in the steam system con-
stitute major operations, but no provisions for repairing them have yet
been made. In the final design, such provisions would be based on indus-
trial experience and practice with conventional heat exchangers that are
operated in the same pressure and temperature range as those used in this

application,

Feasibility

Some of the features of the designs for the heat exchangers that had
to be investigated to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept are worth
mentioning here, In each of the exchangers that have molten salt on the
shell side, a baffle extends across the entire cross-sectional area of
the shell at a distance of 0.5 in. from the tube sheet. This provides
a stagnant layer of molten salt between the tube sheet and the circulating
molten salt, and this insulating layer of salt serves to reduce the tem-
perature drop across the tube sheet, As conceived, the tube-to-tube-
sheet connection is tobe made by rolling at two places within the thick-
ness of the tube sheet and welding at the end of the tube. Trepanning

the tube sheet around each tube makes a reliable tube-to-tube-sheet weld

oo possible.

In cases where the shell-side fluid travels for considerable distance

without baffling, small ring baffles are used to break the flow between

the outermost tubes and the shell. In some cases, long tube lengths are
unsupported by baffles. Although the drawings do not show it, these tubes

can be held in place by some form of wire-mesh tube support.

Heat-Transfer and Pressure-Drop Calculations

The values for the physical properties of the fuel, blanket, and
coolant salt that were used in the preliminary calculations were pro-
vided by the designers of the MSBR. These are given in Table 1. Because
of the unusual situations involved in this heat-exchange system, we
searched the literature to determine correlations between reported con-
ditions and those of our particular application and to select the physical
properties most nearly suited to those involved in our application. From
the material searched, we developed the bases for our heat-transfer and
pressure-drop calculations.

. For calculations involving heat transfer by forced convection
through a molten-salt film inside a tube with a small diameter, we used
data reported by MacPherson and Yarosh.® From the data, the following
equation was written,

These relationships were used to determine values for the heat

reported by Bergelin,* 5 and therefore the relationships given above,
were based on work with half-moon shaped baffles with straight edges,
whereas in the study reported here, disk and doughnut baffles were used
in all the exchangers except the superheater. The adaptation of Bergelin's
data to disk and doughnut baffles involved certain interpretations. The

"number of major restrictions encountered in cross flow" referred to in

-Bergelin's work was interpreted for tubes arranged in triangular array as

being the number of rows of tubes, Ty in cross flow. Cross flow for disk

and ‘doughnut baffles varies in direction through 360° For 30° of change

Stress Analyses

Stress calculations were made for each of the heat exchangers. Where
possible, the shear stress theory of failure was used as the failure
criterion, the stresses were classified, and the limits of stress intensity
were determined in accordance with the methods prescribed in Section III
of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.?

The analyses were performed by treating thermally induced stresses
as secondary stresses in a single-cycle analysis rather than in a multi-
cyclic analysis. This procedure should assure adequate strength so that
future analyses based on cyclic considerations should not result in
severe revisions to the geometries of the exchangers. A departure from

the maximum shear stress theory of failure occurred in the analysis of

the tube sheets of the exchangers. These were analyzed by using the
maximum normal stress theory of failure and the allowable stress intensity
values applicable to an analysis based on the maximum shear stress theory
of failure. No consideration was given to the support of these vessels

or to the loads induced by piping restraints.

The thicknesses of the heads, shells, tube sheets, and tubes were
chosen to withstand the maximum pressure and thermal stresses at the
respective temperatures in the material. The exchangers were tentatively
designed, and the stresses caused by differential expansion and discon-
tinuities were checked to be sure that the allowable stress at the maximum
temperature had not been exceeded.

These analyses reported here are preliminary, but their extent is
considered sufficient to appraise the integrity of the conceptual designs
for the heat exchangers. More rigorous analyses would be required to
investigate cycling and off-design-point operations such as startup or a

hazardous incident.

4. DESIGN FOR PRIMARY HEAT EXCHANGERS

The four primary fuel-salt-to-coolant-salt heat exchangers are
shell-and-tube two-pass exchangers with disk and doughnut baffles. The
basic geometry of the top-supported vertical exchangers, the material to
be used to fabricate them, and the size of the tubes were established by
the designers of the MSBR. The structural material selected for the pri-
mary exchangers was Hastelloy N, and the tube chosen was one with an out-
side diameter of 3/8 in. and a wall thickness of 0.035 in.

"Case A

The criteria governing the design for the primary heat exchangers
for Case A that were fixed by the system are
1. the temperatures and pressures of the incoming and outgoing coolant

salt,
2. the temperatures and pressures of the incoming and outgoing fuel salt,
3. the flow rates of the coolant salt and the fuel salt, and
4. the total heat to be transferred.

The design developed for the Case-A primary heat exchanger is shown
in Fig. 3. The exchanger is about 5.5 ft in diameter and 18.5 ft high,
including the bowl of the circulating pump. The inlet of the fuel-salt
pump is connected to the exchanger, and the fuel salt from the reactor
enters the exchanger from the 18-in.-diameter inner passage of the con-
centric pipes connecting the reactor and exchanger. The fuel salt flows
downward in the exchanger through the rows of tubes in the outer annular
section, and upon reaching the bottom of the shell, it reverses direction
and moves upward through the tubes in the center section.

The coolant salt enters the exchanger at the top and flows downward,
countercurrent to the flow of the fuel salt, through the center section.
Upon reaching the bottom of the shell, the coolant salt turns and flows
upward around the tubes in the outer annular section and leaves the

exchanger through the annular collecting ring at the top.

During the preliminary stages of the design for the Case-A primary
heat exchangers, a computer study was made to determine the effects on
the area of the heat-transfer surface of varying the pitch, the baffle
size and spacing, and the ratio of the number of tubes in the two sections.
The computer code established the minimum baffle spacing limited by ther-
mal stress in the tubes and then increased the spacing as necessary to
remain within the pressure-drop limitations. The thermal-stress criteria
for the computer code were based on the worst possible conditions in
each section of the exchanger, and as a result, the annular section was
designed without baffles. It was therefore necessary to make "hand"
calculations for an exchanger with several baffles in the bottom of the
annular section. This changed the baffle spacing in the center section,
the ratio of the tubes in the two sections, and the length of the
exchanger. The resulting design data for the Case-A primary exchanger

are given in Table 2.

Case B

In the reverse-flow heat-exchange system of Case B, the fuel-salt
and blanket-salt flows were reversed from those of Case A, and the oper-
ating pressures of the coolant-salt system were increased. This involved
redesign of the primary heat exchanger, as well as some of the other
components of the system. The design for the primary heat exchanger for

Case B is illustrated in Fig. 4.

As may be seen in Fig. 4, the flow of the fuel salt in the exchanger
for Case B is reversed from that in Case A, with the outlet of the fuel-
salt pump connected to the exchanger. Fuel salt enters the exchanger in
the inner annular region, flows downward through the tubes, and then
upward through the tubes in the outer annular region before entering the
reactor. The coolant salt enters the exchanger through the annular
volute at the top. It then flows downward through the baffled outer
region, reverses to flow upward through the baffled inner annular region,
and exits through a central pipe.

In this design, a floating head is used to reverse the flow of the
fuel salt in the exchanger. This was done to accommodate the differential
thermal expansion between the tubes and the shell and central pipe. The
expansion bellows of the Case-A design was eliminated, and differential
thermal expansion between the inner and outer tubes is accommodated by
using sine-wave type bent tubes in the inner annulus and straight tubes
in the outer annulus. Doughnut-shaped baffles are used in both annuli.
Those in the inner annulus have no overlap so that the bent tubes have

a longer unrestrained bend.

Design Variables

Before making any detailed calculations for the design of the
primary heat exchanger for Case B, we fixed a number of the design vari-
ables on the basis of our own judgment.

Tube Pitch. As previously stated, the tubes in the inner annulus
are bent and those in the outer annulus are straight. To simplify the
bend schedule for the tubes in the inner annulus, these tubes are placed
in concentric circles with a constant delta radius and a nearly constant
circumferential pitch. The bends in the tubes are made in the cylindri-
cal surface that locates each ring of tubes. A radial spacing of 0.600
in. was selected for these bent tubes in the inner annulus as being the
minimum spacing practical for assembly. The spacing was increased to
0.673 in. in the circumferential direction because the distance between

the tubes at the bends is somewhat less than the circumferential pitch.
 

 

 

 

gn 4 ga

at

[i]

ol

Ny

29

The tubes in the outer annulus are located on a triangular pitch.
The dimension for this pitch, 0.625 in., was selected on the basis of
the calculations done for the Case-A primary exchanger. This spacing
resulted in an efficient use of the shell-side pressure drop.

Number of Tubes. The number of tubes in each annular region is
determined by the allowable pressure drop on the inside of the tubes.
Since for Case B, the heat-transfer efficiency of the inner annulus
needed to be lowered to minimize the temperature drop across the tube
walls, the number of tubes chosen for the outer annulus was less than
the number chosen for the inner annulus. This number of tubes in the
outer annulus was further reduced until all of the allowable pressure
drop for the fuel salt was utilized. The resulting number of tubes in
the outer annulus was 3794 with 4347 tubes in the inner annulus.

Lengths of Annular Regions. The length of the exchanger and the
number and size of the baffles determines the flow conditions for the
coolant-salt pressure drops and the heat-transfer coefficients. Prelim-
inary calculations showed that the exchanger would be approximately
15 ft long, with a recess of about 1 ft for the pump. A 1l4-to-15 ratio
was established for the lengths of the inner and outer annuli.

Baffle Spacing and Size. The baffle spacing in the inner annulus

 

is limited by the length required for the unrestrained bends in the
tubes and the maximum allowable temperature drop across the tube wall.
The use of smaller distances between baffles results in larger outside
film coefficients and therefore smaller film drops. This increases the
temperature drop across the tube wall. The number of baffles selected
for use in the inner annulus was four.

In the outer annulus, an attempt was made to select the baffle size
and spacing combinations that would result in efficient use of the avail-
able shell-side pressure drop. Ten baffles were used in the outer

annulus.

Calculatory Procedures

 

After selecting the just-described design variables, the pressure
drops, the required length of the exchanger, and the stresses in the
tubes were calculated for the selected conditions, and these conditions
were adjusted where necessary. Then the thicknesses required for the
shell, skirt, tube sheets, and head of the exchanger were calculated.
The detailed heat-transfer, pressure-drop, and stress-analysis calcula-

tions are given in Appendix A.

Pressure Drops. The pressure drops for the selected conditions were
calculated, and where necessary, these conditions were adjusted to obtain »
the allowable pressure drops. The pressure drops inside the tubes were

calculated by using Fanning's equation,

These equations developed by Bergelin were the result of his experimental
work with straight-edged baffles. However, we decided that the flow
conditions for doughnut baffles would be similar to those for straight-
edged baffles and that the same pressure-drop equations would be appli-
cable.

Length of Exchanger. The required length of the exchanger for the
selected conditions was calculated, and the selected conditions were
adjusted until the calculated length equaled the assumed length. Six
equations that state the conditions necessary for heat balance in the
exchanger were combined, which resulted in a single equation with the
length of the exchanger as a function of all the other variables. The
development and use of this length equation is given in more detail in
Appendix A.

Stress in Tubes. The stresses in the tubes were calculated, and if
the allowable stresses were exceeded, the selected conditions were
changed to lower the stress. The conceptual design for the exchanger
was analyzed to determine the stress intensities existing in the tubes
of the exchanger that were caused by the action of pressure, thermal
gradients, and restraints imposed on the tubes by other portions of the
exchanger. The major stresses produced in the tubes are
1. primary membrane stresses caused by pressure,

2. secondary stresses caused by temperature gradients across the tube
wall,

3. discontinuity stresses at the junction of the tube and tube sheet, and

4. secondary stresses at the mid-height of the inner tubes caused by
differential expansion of the inner and outer tubes.

The analysis of the inner tubes was made by using an energy method with

a simplified model of the tubes. These calculations for the stresses

are given in more detail in Appendix A.

Thicknesses. The thicknesses required for the shell, skirt, tube
sheets, and head were calculated. The conceptual design for the
exchanger was analyzed to determine the stress intensities or maximum
normal stresses existing in the heat exchanger shells and tube sheets
that are caused by the action of pressure and to determine the loads
caused by the action of other portions of the exchanger. The major
stresses in the shell are
1. primary membrane stresses caused by pressure and
2. discontinuity stresses at the junction of the tube sheets and shell.
The inlet and exit scrolls or toroidal turn-around chamber were not con-
sidered in this analysis. The shear stress theory of failure was used
as the failure criterion, and the stresses were classified and the limits
of stress intensity were determined in accordance with Section III of
the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.

The tube sheets were designed by using the maximum normal stress
theory of failure and ligament efficiencies based on Section VIII of the
ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. The tube sheets were considered
to be simply supported, and the pressure caused by the tube loads and
pressures were used to determine a uniform effective pressure to be used

in this analysis.

5. DESIGN FOR BLANKET-SALT HEAT EXCHANGERS

Heat accumulated in the blanket salt while it is circulating around
the reactor core is transferred to the coolant salt by means of four
shell-and-tube one-shell-pass two-tube-pass exchangers with disk and
doughnut baffles. The basic geometry of the top-supported vertical
exchangers, the material to be used to fabricate them, the tube size,
and the approximate pressure drops were established by the designers of
the MSBR. All surfaces of the blanket-salt exchanger that contact
fluoride salts were to be made of Hastelloy N, the outside diameter of
the tubes was specified as 0.375 in., and the wall thickness as 0.035 in.
The blanket salt would circulate inside the tubes and the coolant salt
through the shell. ‘The pressure drop in the tubes was to be approximately
90 psi, and the pressure drop in the shell would be about 20 psi.
Physical-property data pertaining to the blanket salt and the coolant
salt were also supplied by the designers of the MSER.

Case A

The criteria governing the design for the blanket-salt exchangers for
Case A that were fixed by their function in the overall system are the
. inlet temperature of the blanket salt,
. outlet temperature of the blanket salt,
. mass flow rate of the blanket salt,
inlet temperature of the coolant salt,
. outlet temperature of the coolant salt,

mass flow rate of the coolant salt, and

~N ON BN

the total heat to ‘be transferrred.

As shown in Fig. 5, the configuration of the blanket-salt heat exchanger
for Case A is similar to that of the primary heat exchanger for Case A;
that is, two passes were used on the tube side with the tubes arranged in
two concentric regions and with the blanket-salt pump located at the top

of the inner annulus. The inlet of the blanket-salt pump is connected to

the exchanger, and the blanket salt’ from the reactor enters the exchanger

and moves downward through the tubes in the outer annular region and then

upward through the tubes in the inner annular region to the pump suction.

Straight tubes with two tube sheets are used rather than U-tubes to permit
drainage of the blanket salt.

The coolant salt passes through the primary heat exchangers and the
blanket-salt heat exchangers in series. However, unlike the primary
exchanger, a single coolant-salt pass on the shell side of the blanket-
salt exchanger was judged adequate on the basis of the heat load, tempera-
ture conditions, and the advantage offered by the simplification of the
design for the exchanger. ,

Before any values could be generated for the design of the blanket-salt
heat exchanger for Case A, it was necessary to tentatively fix the values
of some additional design variables. From several approximations, a
triangular tube pitch of 0.8125 in. was chosen, and it was also decided
that there would be an equal number of tubes in each annulus. Disk and
doughnut baffles were selected to improve the shell-side heat transfer
coefficient and to provide the necessary tube support. Baffles on the
shell side of the tube sheets reduce the temperature difference across
the sheets to keep thermal stresses within tolerable limits. An open=-
area-to-shell-cross-sectional-area ratio of 0.45 was selected for the
baffles. Co

With these data fixed, values were calculated for the

number of tubes per annulus,

. diameter of the shell,
size and spacing of the baffles,

length of the tubes,
. thickness of the tube sheets,

. thickness of the shell, and

sy WN =
.

. thickness and shape of the heads.
These design values were dependent upon calculations -and upon an analysis

of the individual heat-transfer coefficients, shell-side and tube-side

pressure drops, and the thermal and mechanical stresses. The resulting

design data developed for the blanket-salt heat exchanger for Case A

are given in Table 4.

A significant improvement over the Case-A design for the blanket-
salt heat exchanger was the inclusion of a floating head in the Case-B
design to reverse the flow of the blanket salt in the exchanger. This
was done to accommodate thermal expansion between the tubes and the shell
and the central pipe. However, unlike the Case-B primary exchanger,
straight tubes are used in both annuli of the blanket-salt exchanger for
Case B. Doughnut and disk baffles are also used in the design for the
Case-B blanket-salt heat exchanger. |

The reversal of the flow direction of the blanket salt, the increase
in operating pressures, and the physical changes in the blanket-salt heat
exchanger did not influence its heat-transfer or pressure-drop character-
istics. Therefore, the calculatory procedures used to determine the
design variables for the Case-B blanket-salt heat exchanger were basi-
cally the same as those used for the Case-A exchanger. The heat-transfer
and pressure-drop calculations and the calculations performed for the
stress analysis for the Case-B design are given in Appendix B.

The calculations performed to determine the number of tubes to be
used in each annulus of the Case-B blanket-salt exchanger were based on
the straightforward relationship between the mass flow rate, tube size,
linear velocity, and density. The number of tubes per pass resulting
from these calculations was 810. Determination of the geometry of the
shells and baffles followed readily once the number of tubes was estab-
lished. | oo |

Calculating the baffle spacing and tube length that fulfills the
heat-transfer and pressure-drop requirements was quite involved. The
heat transfer coefficient for the blanket salt inside the tubes was
calculated by using an equation derived from heat transfer data on
molten salt. provided by MacPherson and Yarosh.' In this equation, the

heat transfer coefficient of the blanket salt inside the tubes,

where

The value determined for h; was 2400 Btu/hr.ft2.°F. The resistance
across the tube wall was then easily evaluated by using the conductivity
equation, and this was found to be 2.8 x 107%,

The first step in determining the heat transfer coefficient and the
pressure drop for the coolant salt outside the tubes was to plot a curve
of the outside film resistance as a function of the baffle spacing. Data
for the curve were generated by calculating the outside film resistance
for various assumed baffle spacings. The method used was based on an
adaptation of the work on cross-flow exchangers done by Bergelin et al,23
At this point, it was possible to establish whether the baffle spacing
was limited by thermal stress in the tube wall or by the allowable shell-
side pressure drop. The outside film resistance, R,» was evaluated for
the maximum temperature drop (46°F) across the tube wall, and the cor-
responding baffle spacing from the curve was approximately 6 in. The
pressure drop at a baffle spacing of 6 in. exceeded the allowable of
20 psi. Therefore, the pressure drop was limiting and the baffle spacing Ca
was greater than 6 in.

The next step in the calculatory procedures was to develop the
equations given below that relate the baffle spacing, the outside film

resistance, and the shell-side pressure drop.

These equations and the curve were then used to determine a baffle
spacing at which the shell-side pressure drop was within the maximum
allowable of 20 psi. Using four baffles at a spacing of 1.65 ft, the
pressure drop across the shell was 14.55 psi. With the tube length
established at 8.3 ft, the pressure drop through the tubes was determined
from the Darcy equation and found to be 90.65 psi.

Analysis of the thermal stresses in the exchanger required determina~
tion of the temperature of the salt between the tube passes. The tempera~
ture was evaluated by a trial-and-error calculation involving a heat
balance between the two tube passes, and its value was determined as
1184°F.

6. DESIGN FOR BOILER-SUPERHEATER EXCHANGERS

Sixteen, four in each heat-exchange module, vertical U-tube U-shell
superheater exchangers are used to transfer heat from the coolant salt
to feedwater. The feedwater enters the superheater at a temperature of
700°F and a pressure of 3766 psi and leaves at a temperature of 1000°F
and a pressure of 3600 psi as supercritical fluid. The four superheater
exchangers in each module of the heat-exchange system are supplied by

one variable-speed coolant-salt pump. -

Case A

The location of the four superheater exchangers in each module of
the heat-exchange system for Case A is illustrated in Fig. 1. The.
criteria governing the design for the boiler-superheater exchangers for
Case A that were fixed by the system are the
l. temperature and pressure of the incoming salt,

2. temperature and pressure of the outgoing salt,

3. temperature of the incoming feedwater,

4. temperature and pressure of the outgoing supercritical fluid,

5. maximum drop in pressure of the supercritical fluid across the
exchanger,

6. flow rate of the salt, =

7. flow rate of the feedwater, and

8. the total heat transferred.

The type exchanger chosen for the system is a vertical U-tube one-
shell-pass and one-tube-pass unit, as illustrated in Fig. 7. The tubes
and shell are fabricated of Hastelloy N because of its compatibility with
molten salt and the supercritical fluid. The U-shaped cylindrical shell
of the exchanger is about 18 in. in diameter, and each vertical leg is
about 34 ft high, including the spherical head. Segmental baffles were
used to improve the heat-transfer coefficient on the shell side to the GO

extent permitted by pressure drop in the salt stream and thermal stresses

in the tube wall. A baffle on the shell side of each tube sheet provides

a stagnant layer of salt that helps reduce stresses in the sheet caused

by temperature gradients. The coolant salt can be completely drained

from the shell, and the feedwater can be partially removed from the tubes

by gas pressurization or by.flushing. Complete drainability was not con-

sidered a mandatory design requirement.
Design variables that had to be determined for the boiler-superheater

exchanger were the

.

length of tubes,

thickness of the wall,
thickness of tube sheet,
. baffle size and spacing,

Non ON

diameter of shell,
8. thickness of shell, and
9. thickness and shape of head.
Because of marked changes in the physical properties of water as its
temperature is increased above the critical point at supercritical pres-
sures, the temperature driving force and heat-transfer coefficient vary
considerably along the length of the exchanger. This conditions required
that the heat-transfer and pressure-drop calculations for the superheater
exchanger be made on incremental lengths of the exchanger. ~
Since the heat balances, heat transfer equations, and pressure drop
equations had to be satisfied for each increment and for the entire
exchanger, an iterative procedure was programmed for the CDC 1604 com-
puter to perform the necessary calculations. This procedure varies the
number of tubes, the total length of the exchanger, and the number and
spacing of baffles to satisfy the heat-transfer, pressure-drop, and |
thermal-stress requirements. The input information, a simplified outline
of the program, and the output information are given in Appendix C.
The values for the physical properties of the coolant salt used in
the calculations were provided by the MSBR designers and are given in
Table 1. The calculations of physical properties for supercritical OC

steam were included in the computer program as subroutines. The values

for specific volume and enthalpy as functions of temperature and pressure
were taken from the work of Keenan and Keyes,! and the values for thermal
conductivity and viscosity were taken from data reported by Nowak and
Grosh.?

An adaptation of Eqs. 3 through 11 and Eqs. 14 and 15 discussed in
Chapter 3 was used to calculate the shell-side heat transfer coefficients
and pressure drops. The heat transfer coefficient on the inside of the
tubes was calculated by using Eq. 13 given in Chapter 3. The pressure
drop on the inside of the tubes was calculated by using Fanning's equation,

The thermal resistance of the tube wall was calculated for each
increment of tube length by using the thermal conductivity of Hastelloy N
evaluated at the average temperature of the tube wall of each particular
increment. ~The procedure used to determine the allowable temperature
drop across the tube wall was based on the requirements set forth in
Section III of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. The thermal
stresses were treated as secondary membrane plus bending stresses with
the maximum allowable value being equal to three times the allowable

membrane stress for Hastelloy N minus the stresses caused by pressure.

Case B

As previously discussed, the operating pressures of the coolant-
salt system were raised in the Case-B design for the heat-exchange
system. The coolant salt enters the superheater exchanger at the same
temperature as in Case A but at a pressure of 251.5 psi, and it leaves
the exchanger at the same temperature as in Case A but at a pressure of
193.4 psi. Thus, the pressure drop across the exchanger, 58.1 psi, and
the heat transfer are the same for Case B as they are for Case A. How-
ever, the difference between the pressure level in Case B and that for
Case A resulted in different stress intensities for the two cases. The
maximum pressure drop through the tubes was specified as 200 psi, but
this value had to be reduced to prevent exceeding the limitation placed on

the maximum height of the exchanger.

Case -C .

Case C is basically a modification of the Case-A heat-exchange system
that was studied briefly to determine the effect of having a coolant salt

with a lower liquidus point. To study this condition, the temperature

 
 

 

54

of the feedwater entering the boiler superheater was lowered from 700°F
to 580°F, and the entrance pressure was set at 3694 psi. With the feed-
water leaving the superheater as supercritical fluid at a temperature of
1000°F and pressure of 3600 psi, the coolant salt entering at a tempera-
ture of 1125°F and a pressure of 149 psi leaves the exchanger at a tem-
perature of 850°F and pressure of approximately 145 psi.

The computer program was used to size an exchanger for these condi-
tions, and the resulting design data for the Case-C boiler superheater

are given in Table 8.

7. DESIGN FOR STEAM REHEATER EXCHANGERS

Eight, two in each module of the heat-exchange system, vertical
shell-and-tube exchangers transfer heat from the coolant salt to the
exhaust steam from the high-pressure turbine. The coolant salt enters
the exchanger at a temperature of 1125°F and leaves at a temperature of

850°F, having elevated the temperature of the steam from 650°F to 1000°F.

Case A

The location of the two steam reheater exchangers in each module of
the heat-exchange system for Case A is illustrated in Fig. 1. The criteria
- governing the design for the reheater exchangers for Case A that were
fixed by the system are the
1. temperature and pressure of the incoming salt,

2. temperature and pressure of the outgoing salt,
3. temperature and pressure of the incoming steam,
4. temperature and pressure of the outgoing steam,
5. flow rate of the salt,

6. flow rate of the steam, and

7 total heat transferred.

Following a procedure outlined by Kays and London,! we selected the
general type of exchanger to be used for these conditions. The reheater
exchangers are straight counterflow ones with baffles, as shown in Fig. 8.
The straight shell occupies less cell volume than a U-tube U-shell design
and requires slightly less coolant-salt inventory. The steam enters the
bottom of the exchanger at a pressure of 580 psi, flows upward through
the tubes, and leaves the top of the exchanger at a pressure of 567.1
psi. The coolant salt enters the upper portion of the exchanger at a

pressure of 106 psi, flows downward around the tubes, and leaves the

bottom portion of the exchanger at a pressure of 89.6 psi. A special
drain pipe at the bottom of the exchanger permits drainage of the coolant
salt.

Disk and doughnut baffles were selected for the exchanger because,
in our opinion, this design results in a more efficient exchanger than
one in which straight-edged baffles are used. Baffles on the shell side
of the tube sheets provide a stagnant layer of coolant salt to reduce
the thermal stresses in the sheets. The outside diameter of the tubes
stipulated by the designers of the MSBR is 3/4 in., and the tubes and
shell are fabricated of Hastelloy N because of its compatibility with
molten salt and steam.

The design variables that had to be determined for the steam reheater
exchanger were the
. number of tubes,

. tube length,
. wall thickness of tubes,
. baffle size and spacing,

. thickness of tube sheets, and

. thickness and shape of head.
To determine these variables, it was necessary to calculate the heat
transfer coefficients, pressure drops, and the thermal and mechanical

stresses. These calculations are given in Appendix D.

»

From a consideration of stresses caused by the temperatures and
pressures to be encountered, a tube wall thickness of 0.035 in. was cho-
sen. From the stipulated tube size (3/4 in. OD), the steam pressure drop,
and an assumed tube length, the number of tubes required was calculated.
This calculated value was corrected by iteration, and the number of tubes
was fixed at 628. A triangular tube pitch of 1 in. was selected, and the

-inside diameter of the shell was calculated to be 28 in. Then, by using
the Dittus-Boelter equation, Eq. 2 of Chapter 3, the heat transfer coeffi-
cient for the steam inside the tubes was calculated as 409 Btu/hr-ftZ.°F.

Design calculations for the shell-side flow of coolant salt were
somewhat more involved. Turbulent flow is desirable for good heat
transfer on the shell side. We therefore arbitrarily chose a Reynolds G
number of 7500 for parallel flow through both the interior and exterior

”

59

baffle windows. The Reynolds number chosen is well above the number at
the threshold of turbulence, and the resulting size of the exchanger is
not extreme. From this number and the mass flow rate fixed by the system,
the flow area in the two baffle windows was determined as 0.764 ft2.
Because we judged it to be good design practice and because it simplified
calculation of the shell-side heat-transfer coefficient, we made the
cross-flow area equal to the flow area through the baffle windows: 0.764
ft®. . Knowing the baffle sizes and pitch, we were then able to determine
the baffle spacing, which is 12.4 in.

The shell-side heat-transfer coefficient was calculated by using an
adaptation of Eqs. 3 through 11 discussed in Chapter 3, and this coeffi-
cient is 2240 Btu/hr- £2 «°F. Knowing the shell-side heat-transfer coef-
ficient, the heat-transfer coefficient for the steam inside the tubes
(409 Btu/hr. £2 .°F), ‘the thermal conductivity of the Hastelloy N, and
the total heat transferred per hour in the exchanger, the length of the

tubes was calculated.

Conventional means were used to calculate the steam-side pressure
drop for the reheater exchanger, and the total was found to be 12 psi.
The pressure drop on the salt side was calculated by making use of an
adaptation of Eqs. 14 and 15 discussed in Chapter 3. The salt-side
pressure drop is 11.4 psi.

In designing the exchanger, a length of shell was allowed for the
inlet and outlet pipes that was somewhat larger than the baffle spacing.
This increased the overall length of the tubes from 21.7 and 22.1 ft.
This small increment in the length was neglected insofar as its effect
upon pressure, velocity, etc., is concerned. The Case A design data for

the steam reheater exchanger are given in Table 9.

Case B

In the Case-B design for the heat-exchange system, the operating
pressures of the coolant salt were raised. The coolant salt enters the
steam reheater exchanger at the same temperature as in Case A (1125°F)
but at a pressure of 208.5 psi, and it leaves the exchanger at the same
temperature as in Case A (850°F) but at a pressure of 197.1 psi. Thus,
the pressure drop across the exchanger, 11.4 psi, and the heat transfer
are the same for Case B as for Case A, but the difference between the
pressure levels of Case A and Case B resulted in different stress inten-
sities for the two cases.

An analysis was made of the stress intensities existing throughout
the reheater for the higher pressure conditions, but the effects of the
design for the coolant-salt entrance and exit pipes and the steam delivery
and exit plenums upon the shell stresses were not considered. These cal-
culations are given in Appendix D, and the resulting stress data are given
in Table 10. All other steam reheater design data for Case B are the

same as for Case A.

Case C

The Case-C modification of the Case-A design for the heat-exchange

system was studied to determine the effect of having a coolant salt with

a lower liquidus point. To effect this, the temperature of the steam

entering the reheater exchanger was lowered from 650 to 551°F, and the

entrance pressure was set at 600 psi.

With the steam leaving the reheater

at a temperature of 1000°F and pressure of 584.8 psi, the coolant salt

entering at a temperature of 1125°F and pressure of 106 psi leaves at a

temperature of 850°F and a pressure of 92.2 psi. The design data for the

8. DESIGN FOR REHEAT-STEAM PREHEATERS

Eight reheat-steam preheaters, two. in each module of the heat-exchange
system, are used to heat the exhaust steam from the high-pressure turbine
before it enters the reheaters to assure that the coolant salt will not be
cooled below its liquidus point. The preheaters are part of the steam
power system, and since they do not come into contact with molten salts,
they are fabricated of Croloy. Being a part of the steam system, the
preheaters are unaffected by the Case-B design for the heat-exchange
system, and their design is the same for both Case A and Case B. Thus,
their location in a module of the system may be seen in either Fig. 1 or
2. However, the need for the preheaters is eliminated in the Case-C
modification of the Case-A heat exchange system.

Throttle steam or supercritical fluid at a temperature of 1000°F
and a pressure of 3600 psi is used to heat the exhaust steam from the high-
pressure turbine, and the preheaters had to be designed for this high
temperature and pressure. A conceptual drawing of the reheat-steam pre-
heater is shown in Fig. 9. The exchanger selected is a one-tube-pass
one-shell-pass counterflow type with U-tubes and U-~shell. Selection of
a U-shell rather than a divided cylindrical shell permits the use of
smaller diameters for the heads and reduces the thicknesses required for
the heads and the tube sheets. Each vertical leg of the U-shell is about
21 in. in diameter and the overall height is about 15 ft, including the
spherical heads. The U-tubes have an outside diameter of 3/8 in. and a

wall thickness of 0.065 in. They are located in a triangular array with

a pitch of 3/4 in, No baffles are used in this design, but the tubes are

supported at intervals.
The supercritical fluid enters the head region, flows down through

the tubes, back up, and exits from the opposite head at a temperature of
869°F and a pressure of 3535 psi. The turbine ‘exhaust steam enters a side
inlet below the head at a temperature of 551°F and a pressure of 595. 4 psi,
flows around the tubes countercurrent to the flow of the supercritical

fluid, and leaves the exchanger ‘through a side outlet on the opposite leg

below the head at a temperature of 650°F and a pressure of 590 psi.

The heat-transfer and pressure-drop calculations made for the
reheat-steam preheater are given in Appendix E. The heat transfer coef-
ficient for the supercritical-fluid film inside the tubes was calculated
by using the Dittus-Boelter equation, Eq. 2 discussed in Chapter 3 of
this report. The reheat steam flows outside and parallel to the tubes,
and the heat-transfer coefficient for the film outside the tubes was cal-
culated by using both Eq. 2 and Eq. 12 of Chapter 3. Equation 12 gave the
most conservative value and it was used in the design calculations.
Pressure drops in the tubes and in the shell were calculated by using

changes in kinetic energy between the inlet and exit of the exchanger.

An analysis of the stress intensities in the tubes, tube sheets,
shells, and high-pressure heads and of the discontinuity-induced stresses
at their junctions was made. The discontinuity stresses at the junction
of the high-pressure head and the shell, the entrance line, and the exit
line were not considered in this analysis. These stress calculations are
also given in Appendix E, and the resulting design data for the reheat-

steam preheater are given in Table 12,

CALCULATIONS FOR PRIMARY HEAT EXCHANGER

Pressure-Drop and Heat-Transfer Calculations for Case B

The Case B design for the primary fuel-salt-to-coolant-salt heat
exchanger is illustrated in Fig. 4 of Chapter 4. The values assumed to
determine the design variables for this two-pass shell-and-tube exchanger

with disk and doughnut baffles are tabulated below.

2 (0a) = length of outer annulus = 16.125 ft,

£(1a) = length of inner annulus = 15.050 ft,

N(oa) = number of baffles in outer annulus = 10,
Nia) = number of baffles in inner annulus = 4,
X(0a) = baffle spacing in outer annulus = 1.466 ft,

X(ia) = baffle spacing in inner annulus = 1.466 ft and 3.396 ft,

P(oa) = tube pitch in outer annulus = 0.625 in. (triangular),

P(ia) = tube pitch in inner annulus

= 0.600 in. radial and 0.673 in. circumferential,

n(oa) = number of tubes in outer annulus = 3794,

n(jq) = number of tubes in inner annulus = 4347.
The assumed length for £(pa) of 16.125 ft resulted in a calculated length
of 16.11 ft. Therefore, the 16.125-ft length was used for the outer
annulus, and the resulting length for the inner annulus was 15.050 ft.
With these variables established, the pressure-drop and heat-transfer
calculations were made, and the terms used in these calculations are

defined in Appendix F.

Pressure-Drop Calculations

Calculation of the total pressure drop inside the tubes involved
the determination of thie pressure drop inside the tubes of both the outer
and inner annuli, and calculation of the total pressure drop outside the
tubes or on the shell side involved the determination of the shell-side

pressure drop in both the outer and inner annuli.

and there is only cross flow in this region. Regions 1 and 3 consist of

baffle windows in which there is a combination of parallel and cross flow.

As may be seen in Fig. A.l, the horizontal cross-sectional area of
the inner annulus, ia, is divided roughly into two flow regions caused
by the alternate spacing of the doughnut baffles with virtually no
overlap. These two regions, 4 and 5, consist of baffle windows in which
there is a combination of parallel and cross flow. The cross-flow area

in the inner annulus is 15.856 ft®. The parallel-flow area in region 5

Heat-Transfer Calculations

The heat transfer coefficients inside the tubes, across the tube
wall, and outside the tubes were determined for both the outer and inner
annuli of the Case-B primary heat exchanger. The overall heat transfer
coefficients were then determined for both annuli, and these values were
used with the mass-flow and heat-transfer equations developed to deter-

mine the required length of the tubes for the primary exchanger.

A leakage factor of 0.80 was assumed for leakage between the tubes and
baffles and between the baffles and shell. Thus, the heat transfer

coefficient outside the tubes,
h) = 0.13504GJ .

For the heat transfer coefficient outside the tubes in the window regions

region at a temperature of 1300°F and a pressure of 147 psi, flows down
through the 4347 bent tubes 15.05 ft, reaches the floating head at a
temperature of 1149°F and a pressure of 119 psi, reverses direction and
flows upward through the 3794 straight tubes in the outer annulus 16.125 ft,

and leaves the exchanger at a temperature of 1000°F and a pressure of

 
 

 

 

86

50 psi. The coolant salt enters the exchanger through the annular volute
at the top, enters the outer annulus at a temperature of 850°F and a
pressure of 194 psi, flows downward to the bottom tube sheet, reverses
direction at a temperature of 979°F and a pressure of 181 psi, flows
upward through the inner annulus and exits into the central pipe at a
temperature of 1111°F and a pressure of 161 psi. The inside diameter

of the outer annulus of the exchanger is 66.7 in., the outside diameter
of the inner annulus is 53.05 in., and the outside diameter of the central
pipe is 22 in.

The stress analysis for the Case-B primary heat exchanger consisted
of a determination of the stresses produced in the tubes, the shells, and
the tube sheets. The shear stress theory of failure was used as the
failure criterion, and the stresses were classified and limits of stress
intensity were determined in accordance with Section III of the ASME
Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. The terms used in these calculations

are defined in Appendix F.

Stresses in Tubes

The stresses developed in the tubes that were investigated are the

1. primary membrane stresses caused by pressure,

2, secondary stresses caused by the temperature gradient across the
tube wall,

3. discontinuity stresses at the junction of the tubes and tube sheets,
and )

4. secondary stresses caused by the difference in growth between the
tubes and the shell.

Primary Membrane Stresses. The primary membrane stresses caused
by pressure are the hoop stress and the longitudinal stress. The hoop

of the joint at the junction. The deflection produced by the moment,

CALCULATIONS FOR BLANKET-SALT HEAT EXCHANGER

Heat-Transfer and Pressure-Drop Calculations for Case B

Each of the four modules in the heat-exchange system has one blanket-
salt exchanger to transfer heat from the blanket-salt system to the cooclant-
gr 18 9.471 x 107 Btu/hr.

* The conditions stipulated for the tube-side blanket salt were an inlet

salt system. The heat load per unit, Q

temperature of 1250°F, an outlet temperature of 1150°F, a temperature drop
of 100°F, and a maximum pressure drop across the exchanger of 90 psig.
Other criteria given for the blanket salt were the flow rate through the
po = 43x 10° 1b/hr and the total velocity, v, = 10.5 ft/sec.

Certain properties of the blanket salt vary almost linearly with tempera-

core tubes, W

ture and pressure. Therefore, average conditions may be used without
serious error. These average conditions for the blanket salt were

1. density, p= 277 1b/ft3;

2. viscosity, pu = 38 lb/hr-ft;

3. thermal conductivity, k = 1.5 Btu/hr* £2 -°F per ft; and

4. specific heat, C= 0.22 Btu/1b-°F.

The conditions stipulated for the shell-side coolant salt were an
inlet temperature of 1111°F, an outlet temperature of 1125°F, a tempera-
ture increase of 14°F, and a maximum pressure drop across the exchanger
of 20 psig. The mass flow rate of the cold fluid, W.¢, was given as

1.685 x 107 lb/hr. The average conditions given for the coolant salt

were

1. p = 125 1b/f3,

2. p= 12 lb/hr ft, eT

3. k = 1.3 Btu/hr' ££ °F per ft, and
4. C= 0.41 Btu/1b-°F.

The material to be used for the tubing was specified as Hastelloy N,
and the tubes were to have an outside diameter of 0.375 in. and a wall

thickness of 0.035 in. A triangular pitch was chosen and set at 0.8125 in.

 
 

112

The baffle cut, F. or the ratio of open area of the baffle to the cross
sectional area of the shell required for the tubes was established as

0.45.

Geometry of Exchanger

The reverse~flow exchanger has a 22-in.-OD pipe in the center through
which coolant salt from the primary fuel-salt-to-coolant-salt exchanger
enters the shell. This central pipe is surrounded by an annular area for
the tubes. Two tube passes with an equal number of tubes in each pass are
used against a single-pass shell with disk and doughnut baffles. The
geometry of this arrangement was calculated as follows, and the terms used
in the equations are defined in Appendix F.

The number of tubes in outer pass, n, = number of tubes in inner

 

 

pass, n_.

which were developed from the work of Bergelin et al,!’2 to determine
the shell-side coefficient in cross-flow exchangers, the outside film
resistance was calculated for various assumed baffle spacings. A curve
of outside film resistance versus baffle spacing was then plotted from
the data developed. The average cross-sectional flow area, Ap» per

These calculated values of the thermal resistance of the outside
film were then plotted as a function of the baffle spacing, and the
resulting curve is shown in Fig. B.l.

From the curve in Fig. B.l, it can be quickly determined whether
the baffle spacing is limited by thermal stress in the tube wall or by
the allowable shell-side pressure drop. Because of thermal stress, the
maximum temperature drop ‘across the tube wall is 46°F. With this infor-

mation and other given data, R can be calculated.

on this 3-in. spacing is in excess of the desired maximum of 20 psi.
Therefore, the baffle spacing will be limited by the pressure drop, and
it will exceed 3 in.

With the limiting factor for the baffle spacing established, some
mathematical relationships between the baffle spacing, the outside film

resistance, and the shell-side pressure drop were established. These

within the maximum allowable of 20 psi. An even number of baffles was
desired for smooth flow through the shell with a minimum number of
stagnant areas. By approximation, four baffles should give a pressure
drop within the allowable. Assuming four baffles, the baffle spacing |
was chosen so that the ratio L/X = 5. For baffle spacing, X = 1.65 ft

Stress Analysis for Case B

The stress analysis for the blanket-salt heat exchanger involved a
determination of the stresses produced in the tubes, the shell, and the
tube sheets. The stresses produced in the tubes are
1. primary membrane stresses caused by pressure,

2, secondary stresses caused by the temperature gradient across the
wall of the tube,

3. discontinuity stresses at the junction of the tube and the tube
sheet, and

4, secondary stresses caused by the difference in growth between the
tubes and the shell.

The stresses produced in the shell are

1. primary membrane stresses caused by pressure and

2. discontinuity stresses at the junction of the shell and tube sheet.

For this exchanger, the stresses in the tube sheets are those produced by

pressure, The shear stress theory of failure was used as the failure

criterion, and the stresses were classified and the limits of stress

intensity were determined in accordance with Section IIT of the ASME

Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.

“The coolant salt enters the blanket-salt exchanger at the bottom
through the 22-in,-0D central pipe at a temperature of 11119F and a

‘pressure of 145 psi, travels to the top of the pipe and enters the

shell side of the exchanger at a pressure of 138 psi, circulates through

the shell and leaves the exchanger at a temperature of 1125°F and a

 
 

124

pressure of 129 psi. The tubes through which the blanket salt is circu-
lated are 0.375-in.-0D ones with a wall thickness of 0.035 in, and a
tube-sheet~to-tube~sheet length of 8.287 ft. There are 810 straight

tubes in the inner annulus and 810 straight tubes in the outer annulus of
the 40.78-in.-ID shell. The tubes are arranged in a triangular array with
a pitch of 0.8125 in. The blanket salt enters the tubes at a temperature
of 1250°F and a pressure of 111 psi, flows down and reaches the floating
head at a temperature of 1184°F and a pressure of 83 psi, flows up and

leaves the exchanger at a temperature of 1150°F and a pressure of 20 psi.

Stresses in Tubes »

The analyses of the stresses in the tubes of the blanket-salt
exchanger consisted of a determination of the four types of stresses
previously mentioned. The terms used in these calculations are defined

in Appendix F.

Stresses in Tube Sheets

The loads on the tube sheets are those caused by the pressure
differential and differential expansion of the tubes in relation to the
tube sheets. In the Case-B design for the blanket-salt exchanger, a
floating lower head is used to accommodate the differential expansion.
Therefore, only the pressure stresses need be considered in this analysis

of the tube sheets for the blanket-salt exchanger.

Therefore, the effective pressure differential,

AP = 118 501.87 97 psi .

For A fA, = 40.78/32 = 1.27, p ~ 0.03; and at a temperature of 1150°F,
the allowable stress, So = 8500 psi. Therefore, the thickness of the

tube sheet,

_2(0.03)(97)(40.78)% _ .
= 8500 = 1.14 in.

T~ 11/8 in.

Checking, the thickness required for the immer annulus portion was
determined. If the differential pressure of 27 psi is considered the
effective pressure, A [As = 32/22 = 1.45 and B = 0.0824. At a tempera-
ture of 1250°F, the allowable stress, Sm = 4500 psi. Therefore, the
thickness of the tube sheet,

© = 2(0.0824) (27) (32)° _ 1.01 in.

T~1 in.

These calculated thicknesses are dependent upon the scroll of the
pump plenum providing the necessary support for the tube sheet. If this
is not the case, a much thicker sheet will be required, and an approxi-
mation of this thickness was calculated. At AJA; ~ 2, B =0.1815., With
a working differential pressure of 97 psi, the allowable stress, Ss, = 4500
psi. The thickness,

The use of 4-in.-thick material for the upper tube sheet matches the
assumption of a rigid tube sheet that was made for the shell section

because some support from the pump plenum will indeed be present.

CALCULATIONS FOR BOILER-SUPERHEATER EXCHANGER

Heat-Transfer and Pressure-Drop Calculations

Since the heat balances, heat-transfer equations, and the pressure-
drop equations had to be satisfied for each increment of the U-tube one-
shell-pass one-tube-pass exchanger and for the entire exchanger, an iter-
ative procedure was programmed for the CDC 1604 computer to perform the
necessary calculations. The outline of the computer program used is given
below in its stepped sequence.

1. Divide the total heat to be transferred into N equal increments.

2. Assume the number of tubes.

3. Start at the hot end of the exchanger.

4. Assume a baffle spacing.

5. Calculate the heat transfer coefficient on the exterior of the
tubes by using the method proposed by Bergelin et al.l’2

6. Assume the pressure drop through the increment of tube length.

7. Determine the temperatures at the end of the increment from a
heat balance.

8. Determine the physical properties of the supercritical fluid
at the end of the increment.

9. Calculate the heat transfer coefficient on the inside of the

tube by using the method of Swenson et al.®

10. Calculate the tube wall resistance using the thermal conductivity
of Hastelloy N corresponding to the average wall temperature.

11. Calculate the overall heat transfer coefficient for this increment.

12, Calculate the temperature driving force for the increment.

13. Calculate the length of the increment using the heat transferred
per increment from Step 1, the number of tubes from Step 2, the overall
coefficient from Step 11, and the temperature driving force from Step 12.

14. Calculate the pressure drop inside the tube for the increment.

15. Compare the calculated pressure drop in Step 14 to the value
assumed in Step 6. If they do not agree, adjust the assumed value and
return to Step 6. When the two values agree within a specified tolerance,
continue to the next step.

16. Calculate the allowable temperature across the tube wall based
on thermal stress considerations using the allowable stress corresponding
to the maximum wall temperature for the increment.

17. Calculate the actual temperature drop across the tube wall
based on the heat transfer coefficients,

18. Compare the wall temperature drops in Steps 16 and 17. If they
do not agree, adjust the assumed baffle spacing and return to Step 4.

When the two values agree within a specified tolerance, continue to the
next step.

19. Repeat Steps 6 through 15 until the summation of the tube lengths
for the increments calculated equals the calculated baffle spacing.

20. Repeat Steps 4 through 19 until all N increments have been cal-
culated. Co

21. Sum the pressure drops through the tubes for N increments. If
the total tube pressure drop exceeds the specified pressure drop, adjust
the number of tubes and return to Step 2, When the calculated tube
pressure drop agrees with the specified drop, continue to the next step.

22, Calculate the pressure drop in the shell of the exchanger and
compare this with the specified shell-side pressure drop.
(a) 1If the specified pressure drop exceeds the calculated pressure drop,
the baffle spacing is limited by thermal stress considerations and

the problem is finished.

 
 

 

142

(b) If the calculated pressure drop exceeds the specified pressure drop,
each baffle spacing is increased and Steps 4 through 21 (excluding
Steps 16, 17, and 18) are repeated until the two values agree. In
this case, the baffle spacing is limited by the shell-side pressure
drop and the problem is finished.

23. Write out the final answers.

The computer input data are given in Table C.1, the terms used in the
computer calculations are given in Table C.2, the computer input data for
one case are given in Table C.3. The computer output data for the baffles
for one case are given in Table C.4, the output data for tube increments
for one case are given in Table C.5, and the computer output data for the

overall exchanger for one case are given in Table C.6.

The computer program was run for several cases to investigate all
the parameters, and "hand" calculations were made to check the accuracy
of the computer program. These hand calculations involved the determina-
tion of the heat transfer coefficient outside the tubes for the first
baffle spacing, the shell-side pressure drop for the first baffle spac-
ing, the thermal resistance of the tube wall for the first increment,
the length of the first increment, and the pressure drop inside the tubes
for the first increment. The terms used in these calculations are defined

in Appendix F.

Stress Analysis for Case B

In the vertical U-tube one-shell-pass one-tube-pass boiler-superheater
exchanger, the supercritical fluid enters the head at a temperature of
700°F and a pressure of 3766.4 psi, flows through the tubes, and leaves the
opposite high-pressure head at a temperature of 1000°F and a pressure of
3600 psi. The supercritical fluid entrance pressure used in this analysis
was 3800 psi, which has a more conservative effect on the analysis. Be-
cause of these high temperatures and pressures, the material chosen for
the exchanger was Hastelloy N. The high-pressure head has an inside
radius of 12 in. and a wall thickness of 4.5 in. There are 349 tubes
inside the shell and they have an outside diameter of 0.5 in., a wall
thickness of 0.077 in., and are on 7/8-in. center lines.

The coolant salt enters the shell inlet below the head at a tempera-
ture of 1125°F and a pressure of 251.5 psi, flows around the tubes through
the 18.25-in.-ID shell, and leaves the exchanger at a temperature of
850°F and a pressure of 193.4 psi. The relative heat transfer resistances
at the supercritical-fluid tube-inlet side of the exchanger and at the

tube-outlet side are tabulated below.

The stress analysis for the boiler-superheater exchanger involved
a determination of the stresses produced in the tubes, the shell, the
tube sheets, and in the high-pressure head. The stresses developed in
the tubes that were considered in this analysis are
1. primary membrane stresses caused by pressure,
2. secondary stresses caused by the temperature gradient across the
tube wall, and
3. discontinuity stresses at the junction of the tube and tube sheet.
The stresses in the shell that were considered in this analysis are
1. primary membrane stresses caused by pressure and
2. discontinuity stresses at the junction of the shell and tube sheet.
The tube sheet thickness required for the allowable stress under the
existing temperature and pressure conditions was determined, and the
maximum primary membrane stresses were calculated for the high-pressure
head.

The maximum shear stress theory of failure was used as the failure

+ criterion, and the limits of stress intensity were determined in accordance

with Section III of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. The terms

used in these calculations are defined in Appendix F.

CALCULATIONS FOR STEAM REHEATER EXCHANGER

The steam reheater exchanger transfers heat from the coolant salt
to the exhaust steam from the high-pressure turbine. The coolant salt
or hot fluid is on the shell side of the exchanger, and the steam or cold

fluid passes through the tubes of the exchanger.

Heat-Transfer and Pressure-Drop Calculations

The criteria governing the design for the reheater exchanger stipu-
lated that the coolant salt enter the exchanger at a temperature of 1125°F
and leave the exchanger at a temperature of 850°F, a temperature drop of
275°F. The flow rate for the coolant salt,

7
Wo = 0.88 x 10

bf 5 = 1.1 x 10° 1b/hr .

Certain properties vary with temperature in a manner that is close to

being linear. Therefore, average conditions may be used without serious

error except in calculating pressure loss at the entrance and exit. The

average conditions given for the coolant salt are tabulated below.

The material to be used for the tubing was specified as Hastelloy N,
and the tubes were to have an outside diameter of 3/4 in. and a wall thick-
ness of 0.035 in. From this information, the pertinent diameters and areas

tabulated below were calculated.

| The selection of the type exchanger to be used to reheat the exhaust
steam was based on the data published by Kays and London.! Our study of
the principles discussed led to the selection of a straight counterflow
unit as being the best suited to meet the requirements for this particular
application. The design for this vertical shell-and-tube counterflow
exchanger with disk and doughnut baffles is illustrated in Fig. 8 of
Chapter 7. The inside diameter of the shell is 28 in., and the exchanger

contains 628 tubes on a triangular pitch of 1 in.

Heat-Transfer Coefficient Qutside Tubes. A modification of Eq. 5 in
Chapter 3 was used to determine the shell-side heat transfer coefficient
for this cross-flow exchanger with no internal leakage and disk and dough-
nut baffles. The opening in the doughnut baffle was sized so that the
flow parallel to the tubes is turbulent; that is, Nee was set at 7500 on
the basis of the outside diameter of the tubes. The disk baffle was
sized so that the flow around it parallel to the tubes is turbulent, and
the baffles were spaced so that the flow of the coolant salt outward from =
the central parallel-flow region is the same as the flow in the parallel-

flow regions.

Stress Analysis for Case B

The operating pressures of the coolant salt were raised for the
Case-B design of the heat-exchange system. The coolant salt enters the
steam reheater exchanger at the same temperature (1125°F) but at a pres-
sure of 208.5 psi, and it leaves the exchanger at the same temperature
(850°F) but at a pressure of 197.1 psi. The steam entry and exit tempera-
tures and pressures are the same for Case B as they are for Case A. The

steam enters the exchanger at a temperature of 650°F and a pressure of

580 psi, and it leaves the exchanger at a temperature of 1000°F and a

pressure of 568 psi. The same type vertical shell-and-tube counter flow
exchanger with disk and doughnut baffles is used for Case B. The shell
of the exchanger has an inside diameter of 28 in. and a wall thickness of

0.5 in. There are 628 tubes with an outside diameter of 3/4 in. and a

wall thickness of 0.035 in, arranged in a triangular array om a l-in.

pitch in the exchanger.
The stress analysis for the Case-B exchanger involved a determination

of the stresses produced in the tubes, shell, and the tube sheets. The

shear stress theory of failure was used as the failure criterion, and the

 
 

174

stresses were classified and the limits of intensity were determined in

accordance with Section III of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.

Stresses in Tubes

The stresses produced in the tubes are
1. primary membrane stresses caused by the steam pressure,
secondary stresses caused by the temperature gradient across the
wall of the tube,
3. discontinuity stresses at the junction of the tube and tube sheet,
and
4, secondary stresses caused by the difference in growth between the

tubes and the shell.

Discontinuity Stresses. Since the tube sheet is very rigid with
respect to the tube, assume that there is no deflection or rotation of
the joint at the junction of the tube and tube sheet. Therefore, the
deflection produced by the moment M and the force F must be equal to
the deflection, A, produced by the pressure load, and the slope at the
junction must remain zero. The deflection caused by differential pressure,

Secondary Stresses Caused by Growth Difference. Unrestrained
differential growth arises from two sources: (1) temperature differences
between the tubes and the shell and (2) pressure differences between the
tubes and the shell. The differential growth caused by temperature dif-
ferences was calculated first. The mean temperature of a tube,

93
ta(tube) = tsteam © 151 (toate - tsteam’ ’

where the fraction 93/151 represents the ratio of the heat transfer
resistance of the steam side plus one-half the tube wall resistance to
the total resistance. Therefore, the mean temperature of a tube at the
steam inlet,

650 + === (200) = 773°F ;

ver

and the mean temperature of a tube at the steam outlet,

ta(tube) =

temperature of the coolant salt flowing through it. The average tempera-

CALCULATIONS FOR REHEAT-STEAM PREHEATER

Heat is transferred from throttle steam or supercritical fluid in
the reheat-steam preheater to heat the exhaust steam from the high-
pressure turbine before it enters the reheater. The exchanger selected
is a one-tube-pass one-shell-pass counterflow type with U-tubes and a
U-shell, as illustrated in Fig. 9 of Chapter 8. There are 603 tubes
with an outside diameter of 3/8 in. and a wall thickness of 0.065 in. on
a triangular pitch of 3/4 in. in the exchanger, and no baffles are used.

The supercritical fluid flowing through the tubes enters the
exchanger at a temperature of 1000°F and leaves at a temperature of 869°F.
The reheat steam enters the shell side of the exchanger at a temperature
of 551°F and leaves at a temperature of 650°F. The terms used in the

following calculations are defined in Appendix F.

Heat~Transfer and Pressure-Drop Calculations

The properties of the supercritical fluid flowing through the tubes
vary almost linearly because the fluid does not pass through the critical
temperature range. Therefore, average conditions were used, and the

supercritical fluid that these calculations were based on are tabulated

Stress Analysis

The material selected for use in this exchanger was Croloy (2.25%
Cr, 1% Mo, and 96.75% Fe) SA 387 Grade D for the plate and SA 199 Grade
T22 for the tubes. The stress analysis calculations were based on a
supercritical- fluid inlet pressure of 3600 psi and an outlet pressure of
3535 psi and a steam inlet pressure of 595.4 psi and an outlet pressure
of 590 psi. This analysis involved the determination of the stresses in

the tubes, shell, tube sheets, and the high-pressure head.

Stresses in Tubes

The stresses produced in the tubes are

l. primary membrane stresses caused by pressure,

2. secondary stresses caused by the temperature gradient across the
tube wall, and

3. discontinuity stresses at the junction of the tube and tube sheet.
