ABSTRACT/SUMMARY

A review of electrical conductivity measurements
in molten fluoride systems covering the period 1927 to
1967 has been made, with particular emphasis on experi-
mental approach. It is pointed out that the common
practice of measuring resistance with a Wheatstone
bridge having a parallel resistance and capacitance,

R. and C_, in the balancing arm can result in consider-
able error if the relation Ry, = rR [1 + R,2C,7 (218) ] is
not employed in determing the solution resistance, Rg.

The frequency dependence of the measured resistance and
the practice of extrapolating measured resistances to

infinite frequency versus 1/Nf is examined in terms of
electrode process concepts. A summary of experimental

approaches and results for 56 molten fluoride systems

is presented.

A REVIEW

Introduction

Invesitgation of the electrical conductivity of molten
salt systems has been an area of lively research in recent
years, and a number of reviews have appeared which deal with

this aspect of transport phenomena , (1~3)

It will be the
intent of this review to limit itself to the subject of
conductance measurements in molten fluor ides. The containment
problems encountered with these materials set them apart from
the other molten halides with respect to experimental diffi-
culties and the consequent precision of measurement which can
be expected. By limiting this review to fused fluorides, it
is hoped that sufficient details may be presented to permit
workers in the field to obtain a comprehensive survey covering
the period 1927 to 1967. To our knowledge, no such review
exists which addresses itself to the questions which we pose
below.

Many investigations in the past have been concerned with
cryolite-containing melts because of their relevance to the
aluminum industry, and a review of these systems has been given

(4)

by Grjotheim and Matiasovsky. Renewed interest in the trans-

port properties of fused fluorides in general has resulted from
their use as fuel, blanket, and coolant materials in molten

(5)

salt reactors.

under contract with the Union Carbide Corporation.
Because of the high specific conductance of most molten
salts (1-6 Q 1! em), (6) experimental approaches have tended
(1),

to fall into two groups (1) use of capillary-containing

cells, which results in a cell constant of several hundred
cm !, the capillaries being constructed from electrically
insulating materials; or (2) use of metallic cells in which
the container is usually one electrode, with a second electrode
positioned in the melt. The latter type of cells have cell
constants of the order of a few tenths cm !, requiring very
accurate measuring bridges and determination of lead resist-
ances. Since the value of measured resistance in such cells
is less than 1Q, errors due to temperature gradients, changes
in cell constant with temperature, and polarization become a
significant problem. Hence, cells of type (1) are clearly
desirable for use in molten salts. However, electrically
insulating materials for capillary construction which are
resistant to attack by molten fluorides are scarce.

Measurement of electrical conductivity in molten salts
differs from similar studies in aqueous solutions in several
significant aspects. It is often the practice to employ some
form of a Wheatstone bridge") (Figure 1) in which the two
upper arms are matched, standard resistances, and the imped-
ance of the cell in one lower arm is balanced by a variable
impedance, Z, in the fourth arm. The balancing impedance is
usually a variable resistance, Ry, and capacitance, Co
connected in parallel, The solution resistance, Re» and
solution-electrode interfacial capacitances, Cy» in the cell

(8)

are considered to be in series (Figure 2). By requiring
one electrode to have a much greater area than the other, the
impedance associated with such an electrode becomes negligible,
and the equivalent circuit reduces to that shown in Figure 3.
(Alternatively, one can employ electrodes of similar area and
treat the capacitance resulting from their series combination

as a single total capacitance, + = i + .) The capaci-
Sq 2

tance resulting from the electrode leads is in parallel across
the entire cell shown in Figure 2. However, at frequencies
ordinarily employed, and with some care in positioning, this
capacitance can be neglected.

When a sinusoidal alternating potential is impressed across
the cell, a sinusoidal alternating current results. If the
potential is insufficient to cause electrochemical reactions
to occur at the electrodes, the equivalent circuit of Figure 3
is valid, and the interfacial capacitance is charged and dis-
charged during each half-cycle through the solution resistance.
By employing an oscilloscope as the null detector, one can
balance the cell impedance with the parallel combination of R,
and Co shown in Figure 1. The two balance equations (when the

standard resistances are matched) are

R Cc
S Pp _
+ == =1 (1)
R_ Cg
and
2 =
RGR, C Cp (2115) 1 2)
These may be combined into
= 1 2 2 2
R, R[1 + C,2R, (2nf)?] (3)

It is often the practice to equate Ry ( the value of the bridge
dials) to Rg (the true solution resistance). (9:10) (In the case

of unmatched standard resistors, their ratio is used.) This
is usually valid in aqueous solutions where Rg and Cg are such
as to result in R,2C,% (201)? being negligibly smaller than
unity. However, in molten salts experimental conditions for
the measurement of electrical conductance can result in
considerable error if these equations are not considered when
using parallel components in the balancing arm of a Wheatstone
bridge. For example, on rewriting equations (2) and (3) in
the form

1

R_ = R [1 + CR 7 (20D)? ] (4)

p

it is evident that in molten salts, where R_? may be smaller by
x

a factor of 10'° that in aqueous solutions (ON having approxi-

(13)

mately similar values an awareness of these relations is
necessary.

Use of equation (3) to calculate Ry is limited by the
accuracy with which the values of the variable capacitance,
Cop and the frequency are known. Use of precision capacitors
can be avoided by employing a bridge in which the balancing

(14) Then in the case of no electro-

components are in series.
chemical reaction, the value of Rg is well represented by the
reading on the balanced bridge; however, this method does
require the use of large capacitors.

When a sufficiently large a.c. potential is impressed on
the cell that charge is transferred across the solution-
electrolyte interfaces during part of each half-cycle, corres-

ponding to an electrochemical reaction, the situation becomes

considerably more complex. However, it is under these conditions

and Waddington report a measured resistance of approximately
that conductivity measurements are usually performed. Based

(15)

on the work of Jones and Christian, resistance in aqueous
systems is generally measured at a series of frequencies and
extrapolated to infinite frequency employing the functional
form ra Use of this particular functional form is attri-

buted and Neumann

to Warburg who, on the basis
of Fick's laws of diffusion, predicted that the polarization
resistance (that part of the measured resistance due to elec-
trode polarization) was inversly proportional to WNT.

Applying the concepts resulting from electrode process
studies (19721) one may envision the equivalent circuit shown
in Figure 4 for an electrode-solution interface across which
charge is being transferred. a, represents the impedance
associated with the reaction, which is in parallel with the
solution-electrode interfacial capacitance. Under the exact-
ing assumptions of faradaic impedance studies, z. may be re-
presented by a frequency-independent resistance, 6, in series
with a frequency-dependent impedance, ~-W-, the Warburg imped-
ance. The latter is conveniently represented gg a resistance
and capacitance in series, R. and Cr» at constant frequency
(Figure 5). At a given frequency the impedances resulting from
R. and C, are equal. However, both vary as £Z

The assumptions upon which the mathematical analysis
which results in £72 dependance of R_ and , rests include
1) semi-infinite linear diffusion of reactants and products
and 2) a small amplitude a.c. potential superimposed on a net

d.c. polarizing potential. These are not the conditions of

conductivity measurements. However, during that part of each
half-cycle during which reaction is occurring at the electrodes,
the equivalent circuit of Figure 4 is a useful concept, even
though 2. may not be treated rigorously according to Figure 5.
That the above considerations lead to the same frequency
dependence as that experimentally determined for many conduc-
tivity measurements 1% renders this conceptual analysis
worth considering.

In brief, then, one may consider the equivalent circuit
of Figure 4 as a rough analog of the solution resistance,
electrode-solution interfacial capacitance, and reaction
impedance (bearing in mind that Z. cannot be represented
exactly by any finite combination of resistance, capacitance,
and inductance which will render it frequency independent).
During that part of each half-cycle in which the potential is
below that which results in an electrode reaction, the equi-
valent circuit of Figure 4 reduces to that of Figure 3, i.e.,
Z. becomes infinite. It is also useful to consider the equi-
valent circuit of Figure 4 in view of the practice of extra-
polating measured resistance to infinite frequency. It can
be seen that at infinite frequency the impedance of Cg is
infinitely less than that of Zz. and Figure 4 again reduces
to Figure 3.

It should be emphasized that while one measures resist-
ance at a series of frequencies and extrapolates to infinite

frequency, one does not make measurements at frequencies

which approach infinity. In fact, very high frequency measure-—

ments (in the megahertz range) are to be avoided because of the
increased admittance of the leads and the fact that at very high

frequencies one ceases to measure a property assoicated with ionic
mobility and observes properties associated with dipole moments
and polarizabilities. Hence the question of concern remains
viz, what functional form of the frequency does one employ to
extrapolate the measured resistance to infinite frequency?

Robinson and Stokes (22)

consider this question in terms

of electrode process concepts as applied to aqueous media and
give balance equations for a bridge with a parallel-component
balancing arm, assuming various relative magnitudes of Rg» o,

(15)

and R.. Under the conditions employed by Jones and Christian,
£2 dependence is predicted. Robinson and Stokes conclude that
one should measure resistance as a function of frequency and
extrapolate to infinite frequency in accordance with the observed
behavior. This is also the conclusion of Nichol and Fuoss, (23)
who observed a f ! frequency dependence of resistance in methanol
solutions.

In molten salts frequency dependence of the resistance has
been reported at polarizing potentials much lower than required

(24,25) (26) have

for faradaic processes. Buckel and Tsaussoglou
found that measured resistance vs. frequency plots show a plateau
in the range 10-100 kHz in aqueous potassium chloride and molten
potassium bromide. They suggest that extrapolation of resistance
vs. £2 would lead to erroneous conductances and that one should
study frequency dispersion in a particular apparatus and select

a frequency-independent region for performing conductivity

27)

experiments. De Nooijer reported that in molten nitrate
1
melts plots of measured resistance vs. f ? were not linear, but

approached linearity as the frequency approached infinity. His
values of measured resistance at 20 kHz only differed from values
extrapolated to infinite frequency by about 0.1 %. Winterhager

(28,29)

and Werner have considered frequency dispersion in molten

nitrate, chloride, and fluoride melts and have applied "electrical

locus curve theory" 30)

to their results obtained employing a
Thomson-type bridge. They conclude that at sufficiently high
frequencies measured resistance becomes independent of frequency,
and they employ a measuring frequency of 50 kHz. Therefore, in
this review particular attention will be given to the observed
behavior of resistance with frequency and to the condition of
the electrode surfaces, since in aqueous mdeia it is observed
that frequency dispersion is less in cases of heavy platiniza-
tion (increased c).

tion was sought from each study which was consulted:

are presented in a manner designed to convey maximum information.
The tabulation is ordered according to the system under

consideration; and within each system, by date of publication,

the earliest appearing first. Where one investigation has

covered several systems, a cross reference is given. Additional

values of « and A may be found in Janz's Molten Salts Handbook (31?

 

for many of the systems reported here. As previously stated,
the primary concern of this review is topics A-F. The results
presented herein are given for comparison and completeness and
were, in all cases, taken from the original publications
(exception: Appendix II).

It will be observed below that a number of publications
have not addressed themselves to some of the questions raised
above. If this review serves only to remedy this practice, it

is considered justified.
