Abstract

A stand is required to test the salt pumps for the Molten Salt
Breeder Experiment (MSBE). It will be designed to accommodate pumps
having capacities ranging from 3000 to 7000 gpm and operating with
salt of specific gravities to 3.5 at discharge pressures to LOO psig
and temperatures to 1300°F normally and to 1400°F for short periods
of time. Both the drive motor electrical supply and the heat removal
system for the loop will be designed for 1500 hp. Preventive measures
to protect personnel and equipment “rom the deleterious effects of a
salt leak will be taken.

The primary and secondary salt pumps for the MSBE will be operated
in the stand using a depleted uranium, natural lithium fluoride salt to
simulate the MSBE primary salt. A prototype salt pump, procured from
the U.S. pump industry, will be subjected at representative operating
conditions to performance and endurance testing of its hydraulic,
mechanical, and electrical design features. The MSBE salt pump rotary
elements will be subjected tc hot shakedown testing in the stand to pro-
vide final confirmation of performace pricr to installation in the re-
actor system. The Xenon-removal device and molten salt instrumentation
to measure pressure, flow, liquid level, etc. will be tested at design
conditions in molten salt as they become available, and the stand will
be modified, as required, to accormodate these tests.

The conceptual design of the test stand is presented. The descrip-
tion, function, and design requirements for components and subsystems
are provided. The principles of operation of the test stand and the
safety precautions are discussed. The maintenance philosophy is de-
scrited and the quality assurance program is outlined.

1.0 Introduction

1.1 System Punction

Reliable salt pumps are necessary to the satisfactory operation of
the Molten Salt Breeder Experiment (MSBE), and efforts to obtain them
will include operating the salt pump with molten salt in a test stand
to prove performance and endurance characteristics.

The salt pump test stand, shown schematically in Figs. 1 and 2, will
be utilized to provide design evaluation and endurance testing in molten
salt at essentially isothermal test conditions of a prototype primary
fuel salt pump for the MSBE and to prooftest the primary and secondary
salt pumps for the Engineering Test Unit (ETU) and the MSBE. The salt
circulating system will be designed to contain the maximum pump discharge
pressure of LOO psig at 1300°F and for short periods of time at 1LOQ°F.
The salt flow can be varied from 3000 to 7000 gpm. This document dis-
cusses the salt pump test stand.

Figure 3 presents a practical configuration for the MSBE primary
salt pump. We presently envision that the hydraulic designs of the
primary and secondary salt pumps will be very similar if not identical.
The similarities in thermal transport properties of the two salts and
in the hydraulic requirements of the primary and secondary salt systems
support this approach. The use of similar hydraulic designs permits
the developmental testing of both salt pumps in this single test stand
with one test salt. The salt pumps, described briefly in Sect. 2.1,

Test Section, will be obtained from the United States pump industry and
installed into the test stand in sequence. The design and procurement
of these pumps, and their drive motors and auxiliary equipment, are not
parts of this salt pump test stand activity, but all these activities
will be coordinated.

The primary salt pump is expected to be located at the reactor core
outlet in the MSBE and thus will operate in the highest temperature salt,
approximately 1300°F, in the primary salt system. The secondary salt
pump will be located at the outlet of the intermediate heat exchanger and

thus will operate in the highest temperature salt, approximately 1150°F,

in the secondary salt system. The primary salt pump tank will be located
in an oven, which will enclose the primary system, and portions of the
pump will be subjected to a high ambient temperature, estimated to be
1100°F. In addition, it will be subjected to intense nuclear radiation
from components in the primary system, the circulating fuel in the pump
tank, and from gas-borne fission products in the pump tank gas space.
The prototype MSBE primary salt pump will be operated in the test
stand in molten salt over the full range of MSBE conditions of tempera-
ture, pressure, flow, and speed to prove the mechanical, structural, and
hydraulic designs of the pump and to provide cavitation inception char-
acteristics at design and off-design operating conditions. However, no
attempt will be made to simulate all features of the high-temperature
oven or to impose nuclear radiation on components in the test stand.
Rotary elements of the primary and secondary salt pumps of the ETU
and the MSBE will be subjected to a high temperature, non-nuclear proof-
test in the test stand in molten salt prior to installation into their
respective systems. At other times the stand will be used to subject
the prototype pump to endurance operation in molten salt. It is impor-
tant to the economy of the MSBE program to demonstrate that the pump has
the capabllity for uninterrupted operation in molten salt for periods of
one year and longer. Subsequently, the stand will be used to study un-
anticipated problems that may arise during the operation of the ETU and

the MSBE. The proposed test program is discussed in Sect. 3.2.

1.2 Summary Description of the System
1.2.1 Salt Circulating System

Figure 1 presents the approximate configurational relationship of
the principal components of the test stand. The stand will be located
in Building 9201-3, Y-12 Area of Oak Ridge Operations.

The salt circulating system consists of the circulating pump (test
section), a throttling valve, two salt-to-air heat exchangers, and the
connecting piping. It provides a closed piping loop for the molten salt
from the pump discharge to the pump suction. A salt storage tank is pro-

vided to contain the quantity of salt necessary to fill the circulating
system. It is connected to the circulating system by a pipe containing
a freeze valve. All salt containing components will be constructed of
nickel-molybdenum-chromium (Ni-Mo-Cr) alloy. Electric heaters capable
of heating the salt system to 1300°F will be provided. Thermal insu-

lation will be installed on the system as appropriate.
1.2.2 Heat Removal System

The heat removal system consists of two salt to air concentric pipe
heat exchangers, two positive displacement air blowers, an exhaust stack,
connecting ducting, controls and noise abatement equipment. The function
of this system is to remove the pump power that is dissipated as heat in

the circulating salt.
1.2.3 Utility Systems

Necessary utility systems will be installed. An inert cover gas
system is provided to protect the salt from contact with moisture and
oxidizing atmospheres and, if needed, to suppress pump cavitation.
Instrument air from an existing system will be used to cool the freeze
valve and to operate instruments.

A 2400 volt electrical distribution system will be installed to
connect the existing electrical supply in the building to the salt pump
drive motor. The existing L480 volt system will be used to supply power
to the heater, blower motors, and auxiliary equipment. An existing
building emergency diesel generator will be used to supply certain func-

tions when normal power 1s lost.

1.2.4 Instrumentation and Controls

 

The instrumentation and controls required to monitor and regulate
such test parameters as salt pump flow, salt temperature, pressure, and
level will be supplied. Salt flow will be regulated with a throttling
valve and measured with a modified flow nozzle. Temperature will be
measured with stainless steel sheathed Chromel—Alumel thermocouples.
NaK-sealed high-temperature transmitters will be used to measure circu-
lating salt pressures. Salt level in the storage tank will be determined

by four on-off probes inserted at different levels in the tank.
An existing Beckman DEXTIR data acquisition system will be used to
log the more important salt temperatures and pressures and the pump salt
flow, power, and speed.

Other test stand temperatures and pressures will be monitored and

controlled with conventional equipment.
1.2.5 Safety Features

The test stand will be enclosed in a sheetmetal structure which will
cover the top and sides and will have pans to catch salt spills and leaks.

The enclosure will be provided with a ventilation system.

1.3 System Design Requirements

 

Criteria have been established to obtain a test stand that will pro-
vide maximum performance and endurance information for the MSBE salt pumps

in a safe and economical manner. The criteria include:
1.3.1 Function

The pump test stand will be designed to (1) accommodate full-size
salt pumps for the MSBE primary or secondary systems, (2) provide a non-
nuclear test environment, and (3) yield performance and endurance data

to assure maximum capability and reliability of the pumps in the MSBE.
1.3.2 Pump Size

The design of the test stand is centered on the pump sizes required
for a 200 Mw(t) MSBE, as shown in Table 1. However, with minor modifi-
cations, it will be capable of accommodating pumps ranging in flow
capacity from 50% smaller to 50% larger than the MSBE pumps. The heat
removal, salt flow, and electric power capabilities will be oversized
to provide this flexibility. Adequate structural allowances will also

be provided to obtain this flexibility.

Secondary Salt Pump 1150 7000 300 80 900 ~150

 

*Includes 500 gpm bypass flow through gas separator.

1.3.3 Allowable Stress for Ni.Mo-Cr Alloy

 

The allowable design stress for high temperature operation of the
alloy will be based on the creep rate criterion, 0.1% elongation in
10,000 hr, at the design temperature. See Table 6.

1.3.4 Instrumentation and Controls

 

Instrumentation and controls will be provided to monitor test stand
cperation, to maintain test parameters within prescribed ranges, and to
obtain required pump test data. A control area will be provided from

which safe operation of the test stand can be maintained.

1.3.5 Engineered Safety Features

 

Engineered safety features will. be provided. As a minimum, they
will be designed to cope with any size pressure boundary break, up to
and including the circumferential rupture of any pipe in the test stand
with unobstructed discharge from both ends.

An independent emergency power system will be provided, designed
with adequate capacity and testability to insure the functioning of all
engineered safety features.

The containment design basis is to contain the pressure and tempers-
ture resulting from the largest credible energy release following an
accident without exceeding the design salt vapor leakage rate. Appropri-
ate features will be provided to protect personnel in case of an acciden-

tal rupture.
1.3.6 Control of Effluents

 

The design of the test stand will provide the means necessary to
maintain control over toxic and radicactive effluents, whether gaseous,
liquid, or solid, to protect personnel. The low level radioactivity is
associated with 2380 and 232Th components in the test salt. Control
will be maintained during normal operation and accident conditions to

preclude the release of unsafe amounts of these effluents.

1.3.7 Quality Standards and Assurance

 

A quality assurance program will be written and implemented to en-
hance the certainty of achieving the pump test operation objectives.
Systems and components that are essential to prevent accidents that
could affect personnel safety or to mitigate their consequences will be
identified and designed, fabricated, and erected to quality standards
that reflect their safety importance. Where generally recognized codes
or standards on design, materials, fabrication, and inspection are used,
they will be identified. Where adherence to such codes or standards
does not assure a quality level necessary to the safety function, they

will be supplemented or modified, as necessary.

1.3.8 Test Stand Parameters

 

Table 2 presents the MSBE design parameters which affect salt pump
design. The principal hydraulic and thermal design requirements for
the salt pumps, based on these MSBE design parameters, have been shown
in Table 1. The principal design requirements for the salt pump test

stand, as deduced from the MSBE requirements, are shown in Table 3.

1.3.9 Thermal Transients

The test stand has a limited capability for performing thermal
transient tests. A cooling transient in the salt circulating through
the pump of 8 to 10°F per minute for a 20 minute period can be obtained
utilizing maximum salt system cooling and reducing pump speed to give
approximately 10% design flow. A similar heating transient can be ob-
tained during operation at design pump speed with the salt cooling sys-
tem off.

A large cooling thermal shock also can be applied to the pump in
the test loop as follows: with the pump motor stopped, the temperature
of the pump impeller and casing and salt in the pump tank can, for
instance, be maintained at approximately 1300°F, while the salt in the
lcop piping is lowered to about 1000°F. The salt pump would be brought
up to design speed within 2 to 3 seconds, and the cocl salt from the
piping would displace the hot salt in the fully loaded pump impeller
and casing.

Prelimirary analysis of the MSBE systems indicates that the plant
can be designed to operate without _arge fast temperature transients.
If analysis of the detailed design indicates that transients outside
the capability of the test stand are likely to be experienced, the test
stand can be modified. Additional equipment would be provided to change
the temperature of the circulating salt through the pump by mixing with

a stream of salt at a substantially different temperature.
11

1.3.10 Codes and Standards

Section 6.0 outlines the codes, standards, specifications, procedures,
reviews and inspections, and the quality assurance program that will be
used to design, construct, and operate the test stand. The design of the
salt containing system will be based on Section III, Nuclear Vessels, for
Class C Vessels of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code and on the
Pressure Piping Code, USAS B3l.l. Approved RDT Standards will be used

for all systems and subsystems as applicable and available.

2.0 Detailed Description of System

 

The test stand consists principally of piping, a pump heat removal
system, utility systems, and instrumentation and controls which are
described below. The salt pump is described also. The safety features

of the stand are described in Section b.

2.1 Test Section

The test section will consist of a salt pump with its drive motor
and controls and the auxiliary lubricating and cooling systems. In the
conceptual configuration, Fig. 3, the salt pump is a vertical, single
stage, centrifugal sump pump with an in-line electric drive motor. This
vertical pump configuration has been used satisfactorily to pump molten
salt in many component test stands, the Aircraft Reactor Experiment (ARE),
and the MSRE. It is expected that the MSBRE pumps will have a similar
configuration and will be larger in size. The primary salt pump will be
designed for service with highly radioactive, high temperature, fission-
able and fertile, molten salt. The secondary salt pump will be designed
for service at high temperature with a molten heat transfer salt. The
tentative design conditions for the MSBE primary and secondary salt pumps
are given in Table 1.

The design and procurement of the salt pumps and associated variable
speed drive motors are not part of this pump test stand activity. Thelr
procurement from the U. S. pump industry 1s directed and funded in

another portion of the MSBE program. This procurement activity will be
closely coordinated with the design, fabrication, and operation of the

test stand.

2.2 Salt System
2.2.1 Function

The salt circulating system provides a closed piping loop for the
molten salt from the pump discharge to the pump suction. A tank to
store salt while the pump is inoperative and equipment to transfer salt

between the storage tank and the circulating system will be provided.
2.2.2 Description

2.2.2.1 Salt Piping. The pumped salt leaves the discharge nozzle
of the pump and enters the piping which contains fixed restrictors to
simulate the pressure drop in the MSBE primary heat exchanger (FR-1)
and the reactor vessel (FR-2), and a variable restrictor (throttling
valve, HCV 100). (Component designations, e.g., FR-1, are presented in
the Schematic Diagram, Appendix D.) The salt passes through these re-
strictors, two concentric pipe salt-to-air heat exchangers (HX-1 and 2),
a flow straightener, a nozzle for measuring flow, and a simulated reactor
outlet before returning to the pump at the suction nozzle.

The pressure levels in the galt circulating system are established
by the head developed by the salt pump and the cover gas pressure required
to suppress cavitation in the pwrp. Relatively small friction pressure
drops will occur in the salt flow-measuring nozzle and the piping loop,
and relatively large pressure drops in the salt throttling valve and the
fixed restrictors. The piping pressure profile for three primary salt
flow rates is given in Fig. 4. The throttling valve is used to vary salt
flows from 3000 to 7000 gpm, the latter flow rate at the wide-open position.
The salt pump will be operated from the high to the low limits of flow
to obtain pump data at design and off-design conditions. Approximately
10%, or 500 gpm, of the primary pump design flow of 5700 gpm is bypassed
through a gas stripper and gas injector system and returned to the pump
suction. This flow does not traverse the main salt circulating system.

in the pipe of 30 ft/sec, (2) minimization of salt inventory, and (3)
satisfactory heat lrsnefer in the salt-to-alr heat removal system. The

design pressure for the piping is 200 psig. A short section of 10-in.- -
diam pipe, containing tie flow restrictor {(FR-1) which simulates the pri-
mary heat exchanger, connects the pump discharge to the throttling valve.
The design pressure for this section of piping is 340 psig which will
accommodate pressures up to 400 psig for short periods of time. Location
of this fixed restrictor and throttiing valve close to the pump discharge
provides a lower pressure downstream of the valve to permit the use of
hinner wall pipe for the major portion of the salt piping. A preliminary
stress analysis indicates that the wall thickness of 0.500 in. for the
10-in. pipe and 0.375 in. for the 12-in. pipe will be adequate.

The throttling valve will be a manually operated valve very similar
to one that was developed several years ago for molten salt use at Oak
Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). One of these valves (3 1/2 in. in size)
is presently in use in a molten salt test stand at ORNL, and it has been .
operated more than 40,000 hr. Four other valves have operated from 10,000
to 25,000 hr. This valve design will be "scaled up" in size (probably to -
10 in.) for use in the test stand. The design pressure of 300 psig for
the “alve body will be based on the allowable stress values for long term

creep, Section 1.3.3, however, this pressure can safely be exceeded for

wm

hort periods of time to obtain the required range of pump head vs flow

data.

2.2.2.2 Salt Storage Tank and Transfer Line. The salt storage tank

 

will be designed to contain the quantity of salt required to fill the

pump tank, all the piping in the circulating system, and the transfer

Line. The salt in the tank can be in liquid or solid form. The tank

will be equipped with electric heaters capable of heating the tank and

contents to 1200°F. The tank, which is tentatively sized 4 ft in diam

by 12 1/2 ft long, will contain the estimated system salt volume of

100 cu ft and provide for a gas space, the thermally expanded salt, and

a heel in the tank. A preliminary analysis indicates that for a design

temperature of 1200°F and design pressure of 75 psig, a tank wall thick- -

ness of 3/8 in. will suffice.
15

The salt transfer line connecting the salt storage tank to the cir-
culating salt piping loop will be 1 1/2 in. sched LO piping. A 1 1/2-in.
air-cooled freeze valve, identical to freeze valves used in the MSRE,
will be used to establish a plug of sclid salt in the drain line and thus
maintaln the appropriate salt inventory in the salt piping. Auxiliary
heating will be applied, when required, to melt the frozen salt plug and
permit molten salt to flow through the transfer line from the salt piping
into the storage tank.

Based on experience at the MSRE, it is estimated that the freeze
valve can be frozen or thawed in less than 15 minutes, and the piping

loop can be drained by gravity in 45 to 70 minutes.

2.2.2.3 Salt Selection. Presently, the hydraulic designs for the
primary and secondary salt pump are practically identical; therefore,
it is planned to operate the rotary elements of both the primary and
coolant salt pumps in the test stand using a single salt identical to
the reactor primary (fuel) salt, except that depleted 238U instead of
enriched 2350 and natural lithium instead of lithium-7 will be used.
The cost of the test salt is significantly less than that of the reactor
primary salt, and the chemical and physical properties of both salts are
identical.

Chemical composition and physical properties of the primary salt
and secondary salts are given in Tables 4 and 5.

2.2.2.4 Material for Construction. The material chosen for the
salt-containing piping and all salt wetted parts is the Ni-Cr-Mo alloy
used to construct the salt system in the MSRE and selected for the MSBE.

The composition and properties of this alloy are given in Table 6.

2.2.2.5 BEBlectric Heaters. Electric heaters, capable of heating
all salt-containing piping and equipment to 1200°F, will be provided.
The heaters will be 230 v tubular type, and ceramic heaters, in which
the heating element is totally enclosed in ceramic. In general, the
heaters will be derated by applying a maximum of 1LO wv.

Manually operated variable voltage circuits will be provided for
control of the heater power. Ammeters will be provided for supervision

of each heater circuit. Operation of the heaters will be monitored by

2.3 Heat Removal System
2.3.1 Function

The power supplied by the pump to the circulating salt is dissipated
in heating the salt. The function of the heat removal system is to re-
move this heat from the circulating salt, and thus prevent the salt piping

from reaching excessively high temperatures.
2.3.2 Description

Without heat removal the anticipated pumping power of 1000 hp for
the primary salt pump would raise the temperature of the approximately
100 ft of circulating salt nearly 6°F per minute. A study was made of
an open cycle system designed to remove 3.82 x 10° Btu/hr, that is, to
accommodate 1500 hp pumping power.

Several different heat removal systems were investigated to provide
a tolerable ncise level, reasonable physical size, safety, economical
and simple construction and operation, and minimum maintenance. Systems
investigated included (1) thermal convection salt-to-air radiator, (2)
forced circulation salt-to-air radiator, (3) salt-to-steam heat exchanger,
ard (4) selt-to-air heat exchanger with and without water mist. The most
suitable heat removal method and the one adopted consists of two concen-
tric air cooling Jackets mounted one on each of two straight pipe runs
in the loop and supplied with air by positive displacement blowers.

(See Fig. 1 and the Schematic Disgram, Appendix D.)

2.3.2.1 Heat Exchangers. Table 7 presents important parameters
and results of the study of the sali-to-air concentric pipe heat ex-
changers. The salt is in the 12-in. pipe (OD 12.75 in.) and the blown
alr is in the concentric annular flow passage. A typical cross section
through the heat exchanger is shown in Fig. 5. Two separate, identical
heat exchangers (HX-1 and -2) are used to reduce the size of the air
blowers and the resulting noise level, simplify heat exchanger design,

and provide flexibility in the operation of the test stand.

2.3.2.2 Blowers. Air is used as the cooling medium and is forced
through appropriate ducting and the annulus of each of the two salt-to-
air concentric pipe exchangers by a separate positive displacement blower.
After the alr leaves the heat-exchangers it is discharged through a stack
into the atmosphere at approximately 600°F.

Positive displacement blowers were selected because of their reli-
ability, economy, and capability to move large quantities of atmospheric
air against a relatively high pressure drop. Blower data are shown in
Table 8.

The blowers (B-1 and B-2) and drive motors will be ingtalled out-
side the main test building (Bldg. 9201-3) to reduce the noise level in
the area around the test stand. They will be housed in a sound-proof
shed to reduce noise in the area adjacent to the test building. In
addition, blower intake and discharge silencers will be installed to

reduce the noise level.

2.4 Utility Systems

The test stand will be provided with the necessary inert gas, instru-
ment air, and electricity for the operation of the stand and the salt pump.
Argon, helium, and instrument air of appropriate quality and sufficient
quantity are available in the test building. The electrical capacity
available in the building 1s sufficient to supply all the test stand and

salt pump requirements.
2.4.1 Inert Gas

An inert cover gas is used to protect the primary salt from contact
with moisture and oxidizing atmospheres. It is used to pressurize the
pump to prevent cavitation, to pressurize the salt storage tank and
thereby transfer the salt into the salt circulating system, and to re-
duce the pressure differential across the bellows of the salt throttling
valve. Inert gas from two sources will be used. An 80 psig supply will
provide inert gas for most applications. A 200 psig supply station
utilizing high-pressure cylinders of either argon or helium will be made
available. Necessary piping, valves, and instrumentation will be pro-

vided to conduct inert gas to the appropriate locations.
2.4.2 Instrument Air

Dry instrument air will be used as a coolant for the freeze valve
(FV-200) in the salt transfer line (line 200) and for operating instru-

ments. This air will be obtained from the Y-12 instrument air supply.
2.4.3 Electrical

The principal electrical systems for the experiment are shown on
the attached Instrument and Piping Schematic Diagram, Appendix D. Ex-
isting building facilities include a 13.8 kv bus of sufficient capacity
to supply a 1500 hp drive motor, a 480 v bus duct available to supply
the preheaters and all the auxiliary equipment, and a 480 v diesel-
driven generator system available to provide emergency power during

normal power outages.

2.4.3.1 2400 Volt System. A new 2400 volt electrical distribution

system will be installed inside the building to connect the existing
23

power supply to the pump drive motor and will provide for a motor as large
as 1500 hp. The new system will be connected to the existing 13.8 kv bus
and will consist of (a) one 1200s, 13.8 kv oil circuit breaker, (b) 350
MCM, 15 kv cable, (c) 1500 kva, 13.8/2.4 kv 30 transformer, (d) 1200a,
2.4 kv reduced voltage starter equipment, and (e) 300 MCM, 5 kv cable
connected to the pump motor.

The existing 13.8 kv bus is located in the southeast corner of the
building. The transformer and starter equipment will be outdoor type
and will be located at the west side of the building. Connecting cables

will be run in conduit.

2.4.3.2 L4B80/2k0/120 Volt System. All heaters and auxiliary equip-

 

ment will be fed from the existing L480 v system. Transformers will be
provided to supply 240 v and 120 v where necessary.

The heat exchanger blower motors (B-1 and B-2) and pump lube oil
equipment will be supplied directly from the 480 v bus through combination
motor starters. Five 480 v circuits feeding 380 - 120/240 v transformers
will supply power to the salt piping and equipment heaters. Additional
circuits will supply 120 v power to instrument circuits and miscellaneous
equipment.

Supply power to the pump lube oil equipment, salt freeze valve
(FV 200), and pump shield plug cooling system will be automatically
switched to the building emergency diesel generator in the event normal

power is lost. Return to normal power will be by manual operation.

2.5 Site Location

The test stand containing the salt circuit will be located at the
west end of the second floor of Building 9201-3 in the Y-12 Plant, Oak
Ridge, Tennessee. The cooling air blowers and auxiliaries are located
on the ground level cutside the west end of the building. See Figs. 1,
2, and 6 for elevation, plan, and plant locations, respectively. This
location in the building was chosen because it (1) is suitable, (2) pro-
vides convenient access to existing pump maintenance facilities, (3)
permits installation of large blowers (B-1 and 2) outside the test

building, and (4) is available with minimum renovation and disturbance

to existing test stands and shops.

An existing traveling bridge crane, with 20-ton and 5-ton hoists,
gerves the area. In addition a l-ton jib hoist is available to provide
additional hoisting capability, when needed.

Additional second floor support columns under the area of the test
stand will be required to support the estimated test stand weight of
approximately 80,000 1b.

 

2.6 Instrumentation and Controls

See Appendix D, Preliminary Instrument and Piping Schematic Diagram

for a detailed presentation of instrumentstion and controls.

2.6.1 Temperature Measurement and Control

 

Approximately 200 stainless steel sheathed, insulated Junction,
Chromel—Alumel thermocouples will be used to monitor temperatures on the
pump test section, on heat exchangers, in air systems, and for loop
heater control. The thermocouples will be connected to the reference
Junctions at the control cabinets by double shielded Chromel—-Alumel ex-
tension lead wire, with the shield being grounded at the thermocouple
end only. Temperatures will be read out on available multipoint strip
chart reccrders and indicating controllers. The more important tempers-
tures will also be read out on the DEXTIR data logging system (described
in Sect. 2.6.6), and on an existing 100 cycle per second oscillographic

recording system.
2.6.2 Pressure Measurement and Control

NaK sealed high-temperature transmitters will be used to measure
loop pressures at the pump inlet (PT-201), pump outlet (PT-2-2), and at
the outlet of throttle valve HCV-100 (PT-206). Sensing heads PE-202 and
PE-206, which will be rated at L40O psig, will have to be developed and
will be long delivery items, possibly up to two years. PE-201 will see
a pressure of less than 100 psig during loop operation, and transmitters
are on hand of this rating; however, the transmitter would have to be
isolated while the LOO psig units were being calibrated. This could
possibly be done by freezing the NaK in the capillary. If this is not
no
oN

feasible, then a differential pressure transmitter (with two sensing heads)
will be used tc get the desired accuracy at the lower pressure reading.
PT-201 and PT-202 will be read out on existing single-point strip
chart recorders and on DEXTIR. Strain gauge power supplies PX-201 and
PX-202 will be purchased. PT-206 feeds a pneumatic signal to PC-59 and
PT-59, controlling the gas pressure to the bellows of throttle valve
HCV-100.
Buffer gas pressure, lube oil pressure, and air pressures will be
read on conventional gauges and controlled as required by pressure switches,
solenoid valves, and hand valves. Differential pressure across IFS-1 and

IFS-2 will be measured by locally mounted gauges PAI-10 and PAI-20.
2.6.3 Flow Measurement

Mein loop flow in the range of 3000 to T7000 gpm will be determined
by measuring the differential pressure across the modified flow nozzle.
The 0 to 600 in. W.C. differential pressure transmitter (PdT-203) will
be high-temperature NaK-seal with sensing heads PE-203 and PE-20L4 rated
to withstand LOO psig. The transmitter pneumatic output will be converted
and read out on an existing single-point strip chart recorder.

Instrument air flow to the freeze valve (FV-200) will be read on
panel mounted rotameter FI-70C. The measurement of lube oil flow to the
salt pump will be included in the iube oil package. Flow measurements
are not planned for the enclosure =xhsust air or the cooling air to the
heat exchangers HX-1 and HX-2.

2.6.4 Level Measurements

Salt level in the storage tank (SST) will be determined by the
insertion of four on-off probes at different levels in the tank. Tank

level would be indicated by the on-off position of four indicating lights.

2.6.5 Alarms and Interlocks

 

The strip chart recorders, indicating controllers, and pressure
switches will have low and high signal switch contacts for control and
alarm (see Section 3.5) purposes. Alarms will be indicated by a bell
and existing annunciator panels with lighted windows that show abnormal

conditions before and after acknowledgment and normal conditions before
27

and after reset. Scram action will be provided as appropriate, either
simultaneously with the alarm or at a desired increment above or below

the alarm setting.
2.6.6 Data Acquisition Computer System

This system consists of a Beckman DEXTIR data acquisition system
interfaced to a Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-8 computer which has
a core memory of L096 twelve-bit words. Engineering units conversion
of the data is done on-line, and all data are digitized and recorded on
magnetic tape for further processing by the ORNL IBM 360/75 computer.

A large library of programs is available to process these tapes.

The data acquisition computer system can provide a listing of data
in engineering units at the test stand. It has a capacity of 2500 analog
and 2500 digital inputs and has a speed of 8 channels per second. Overall
accuracy is +0.07% of full scale, resolution is one part in 10,000, and
the input signal range is 0-10 millivolts full scale to 0-1 volt full
scale in three programmable steps.

Data gathering boxes, each with 25 analog and 25 digital channel
capacity, can be plugged into the "party line" cable at any point in the
network. igital input capability is provided by both thumbwheel switch
and contact input modules. The modules can accept decimal or binary
coded decimal contact closures from counters, clocks, frequency meters,
digital voltmeters, and other devices that have digital outputs. Thermo-
couple reference junction compensation is provided for all thermocouple
inputs.

The PDP-8 computer software consists of a real time multiple task
executive system, with four levels of priority interrupt. The highest
priority level is assigned to protection of the operating system in case
of power failure. The second priority is assigned to the processing of
data, the third to keyboard input, and the fourth to printer output.

Another package of computer programs performs the engineering units
conversion tasks and such utility functions as punching tape, reading
tape, entering data into memory, listing the contents of specified

memory locations, clearing specified memory locations, etc.
28

A disk file is on order which will provide an additional 32,000
words of bulk storage and will permit the individual experimenter to

have his own program for on-line calculations and teletype plots.

3.0 Principles of Operation

 

All the salt pumps will be operated in a depleted uranium, natural
lithium version of the MSBE primary salt. Operation of the secondary
salt pump at its design head and flow conditions with the denser primary
salt would overload the pump drive motor and overpressurize the salt sys-
tem piping. Therefore, we plan to operate the secondary pump at its
design speed and temperature, but with a slightly reduced diameter im-
peller (about 80% design diameter) which will load its motor to rated
power and will stress the pump casing, shaft, and impeller to their res-
pective design levels without overstressing the salt piping system. This
general philosophy was used to proof test the fuel and coolant salt pumps
for the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE). The hydraulic performance
characteristics for the salt pumps will be obtained during water tests

conducted ty the pump manufacturer.

3.1 Startup

All the facility and test components, assemblies, and systems will
be inspected individually and collectively prior to startup. These
inspections will be made to check conformance to approved drawings,
specifications, and standards.

While at room temperature the salt system will be purged with inert
gas, evacuated to remove oxygen and moisture, and refilled with inert
gas. Tne mechanical performance of the salt pump and drive motor will
be observed during operation with inert gas. The salt system will be
preheated to the desired temperature (normally 1200°F). During preheating,
the salt system will be evacuated to further reduce moisture and oxygen
and then refilled with inert gas several times. The salt pump will again
be rotated briefly to check the running clearances at temperature.

The salt storage tank, previously filled with molten salt, will be
29

slowly pressurized with inert gas to transfer salt into the salt system.
The freeze valve will be frozen to hold the salt in the system. The re-
guired flow rates of the inert purge gas will be established and the

appropriate pressure on the surface of the system salt will be obtained.
Finally the salt pump will be started and functional checks will be made

on all systems for proper performance.

3.2 Test Operation

When the salt pump and all test stand systems are performing satis-

factorily, the following salt pump test program will be initiated:
3.2.1 Prototype Pump

1. The mechanical performance of the salt pump and drive motor will
be observed.

2. The design of the drive motor and cooling system and the drive
motor support system will be proven.

3. The lubrication system for the salt pump and the provisions for
handling shaft seal oil leakage will be checked.

4. The transient characteristics of pump speed and salt flow during
startup and coastdown will be determined.

5. The hydraulic performance and cavitation inception characteristics
of the salt pump will be obtained over a range of pump speeds and salt flow
rates and temperatures.

6. The characteristics of the purge gas flow, which is introduced
into an annulus around the pump shaft to control fission product diffusion
up the shaft into the gas seal region, will be determined.

T. The characteristics of the pump with the helium bubble ingester
and removal devices, which will be used to remove Xenon 135 from ecircu-
lating salt, will be verified in salt.

8. The maximum salt void fraction that the pump will tolerate will
be determined. Measurements will be made of the void fraction in the
circulating salt due to gas entrained from the gas space by the salt by-

rass flows within the pump.
30

9. The production of aerosols of salt in the prototype pump tank
during pump operation will be checked as will any aerosol removal device
needed to protect the off-gas lines and components from plugging by aero-
sol deposition.

10. The effect of operating the pump with insufficient salt, to the
point of the start of ingassing, will be studied.

11. The pump bowl cooling system will be evaluated.

12. Demonstration tests of Incipient Failure Detection (IFD) devices
and systems will be made. Pump manufacturers will be requested to recom-
mend IFD devices and systems to indicate a substantial change in a pump
operating characteristic that might point to an impending failure of some
pump component. Parameters that may yleld significant reliability infor-
mation include pump power and speed, shaft vibration and displacement, and
noise signatures of the pump at various operating conditions.

13. After all specific short term tests have been completed, long

term endurance test runs will be performed.
3.2.2 ETU and MSBE Pumps

Rotary elements of the primary and secondary salt pumps of the ETU
and the MSBE will be subjected to a high temperature, non-nuclear proof-

test prior to installation into thelr respective systems.

3.3 Shutdown

Shutdown of the syster will be initiated by turning off the salt
pump and the air blowers. The salt will be drained into its storage tank
by thawing the freeze valve and equalizing the gas pressures in the pump
and storage tanks. After the salt is drained from the system, the pump
will be rotated for a short time to sling off any salt clinging to the
impeller. The electric heaters will be turned off and the system per-
mitted to cool to room temperature. The lubrication system will be turned
off as pump temperature is reduced to near room temperature. An inert gas
atmosphere will be maintained in the loop. When the system is cool it

will be ready for maintenance of components or for removal of the salt

pump.
31

3.4 Special or Infrequent Operation

 

In addition to the previously outlined pump test operation, the test
stand will be operated to:

1. Obtain the characteristics of instrumentation for measuring salt
flow and pressure as required.

2. Study problems which may arise during the operating life of the
BTU or MSBE.

3.5 Equipment Safety

To provide for the safety of the salt pump, test stand, and test
personnel, several pump and test stand operating parameters will be
monitored continuously. These parameters will include pump power, speed,
and lubricant flow; salt temperature, flow, and liquid level; pump and
test stand vibration; alr blower power and oil pressure, and shield plug
and drive motor coolant flow. Table 9 presents a listing of the emergency

conditions and the actions to be taken.

4.0 Safety Precautions

A preliminary safety analysis of the pump test stand was made to
identify potential accidents and the consequences and to deduce methods

to prevent accidents and minimize the consequences.

4.1 Loss of Normal Electrical Power

 

Loss of electrical power will cause the salt pump motor, cooling air
blower motors, and preheaters on the salt piping and equipment to cease
operation. Salt in the salt circulating system will become stagnant and
will cool from the normal operating temperature of 1300°F. To prevent
salt from freezing (~930°F mp) in the piping and the pump, it must be
drained into the salt storage tank. Since solid salt in the freeze valve
can be thawed most quickly with electric heaters, a reliable, emergency
source of electric power is required. The existing emergency power source
consists of a diesel-driven 300 kw electric generator located in Building
9201-3, which has been in backup duty for 12 years. It is operated once
each week to maintain readiness and it has never failed to start.

During power failure the emergency power supply will also be used to
operate the salt pump lubrication and the shield plug cooling systems to

protect pump shaft bearings and seals from overheating.

h.2 Incorrect Operating Procedure

 

Instrumentation, including alarms, interlocks, and other safety de-
vices, will be installed to minimize operating errors that could affect
personnel safety or result in damage to equipment. In order to further
minimize such errors the operation of the test stand will be under the
supervision of technical personnel experienced in the operation of molten
salt systems. They will use step-by-step instructions contained in care-
fully written procedures to start up, operate, and shutdown the test stand.
Assistance in test stand operation and in the execution of the salt pump
test program is expected from engineers assigned by pump manufacturers who

participate in the MSBE salt pump program.
3h

4.3 Tesk or Rupture in Salt Containing Piping and Equipment

Consequences

a. Leak. High pressure could jet a small stream of molten salt a
distance in excess of 10 ft.

b. Rupture. Large quantities of molten salt could flow onto the
floor in the immediate vicinity of the test stand.

c. Salt vapors and particles could be picked up by cooling air and
released from the exhaust stack, if the salt pipe ruptures inside the
heat exchanger air cooling Jacket.

d. Cooling alr could blow vapors and particles over a large area
inside the building, if the salt pipe and the heat exchanger air cooling

jacket are ruptured.

Protection Required

a. Protect personnel from toxic effects of beryllium.

b. Protect personnel in the vicinity of the test stand from high
temperature burns.

¢c. Prevent high-temperature molten salt from starting fire in com-

tustible material and equipment in the surrounding area.

Preventive Measures
a. OSalt-containing equipment will be designed, procured, and fabri-
cated according to applicable high-quality standards.

t. The salt containing ecuipment will be enclosed within a sheet-

0

metal structure having a top and sides to contain molten salt jets. All
portions of the test stand enclosure in line with the direction of flow
in the salt piping will be designed to withstand the momentum effects of
a double-ended salt piping rupture.

c. One or riore metal pans will be placed under the salt piping loop
to contain all molten salt spills.

d. An exhaust system, operating continuously, will be provided to
exhaust the test stand enclosure. The air will be filtered before it
is discharged intc the outside atmosphere.

e. A minimum of 7 air sampling stations will be provided inside the
enclosure, in the exhaust stacks, and in the immediate area around the

test stand. The air sampling stations will be monitored daily for the
35

presence of beryllium by the Industrial Hygiene Department. Air in the
Y-12 general area is also monitored for beryllium and other materials.

f. In the event of a molten salt leak, interlocks and alarms will
be provided in the control system to shut off the circulating salt pump
and the cooling air blowers. Salt will be drained from the system piping
into the salt storage tank by manual control. The low liquid level indi-
cator in the pump tank will be used to detect large salt leaks, and smaller
leaks will be detected by air sampling, as indicated in Item e above.

g. The salt spill cleanup procedure, developed previously for use

in Building 9201-3, will be followed in case of a salt leak.

5.0 Maintenance

5.1 Maintenance Philosophy

 

One of the major requirements of Molten Salt Reactors is that com-
ponents, systems, and subsystems perform for long periods of time without
malfunction or failure because of the difficulty and expense of maintain-
ing highly radioactive equipment. As a result design, fabrication, equip-
ment selection, and installation work will be directed toward the goal of
obtaining maintenance-free equipment. Therefore, high quality equipment
will be installed in the salt pump test stand with critical equipment
monitored continuously and shut down for maintenance when failure is
impending. Symptoms of impending failure can be detected by visual and
audio observations and by pressure, temperature, flow, vibration, and
other diagnostic instrumentation. Experience has indicated that symptoms
of impending equipment failure usually develop sufficiently far in advance
to permit the scheduling of maintenance activities without excessive out-

ages or equipment damage.

5.2 Preventive Maintenance

 

Certain instruments, and in particular the ones with moving parts,
will be checked and serviced on a routine basis. All instrumentation

will be checked and recalibrated between test runs.
36
6.0 Standards and Quality Assurance

6.1 Codes and Standards
6.1.1 Design

Specific requirements have been determined for the salt pump test
‘stand, as stated in Section 1.3. These requirements have been approved
by the Molten Salt Reactor Project and Leboratory Management. Experi-
enced and qualified designers will be assigned to the task, and when
detail drawings are completed, they will be reviewed for function,
safety, and construction. Engineering standards and procedures in the
area of design have been establishsd and are given in Appendix A. In
general, the requirements specified in Section III for Class C vessels
of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code and in the Pressure Piping
Code USAS B3l.l1 will be used in the design of the salt containing system.

A complete piping stress and flexibility analysis will be made.

6.1.2 Materials

The Ni-Mo-~Cr alloy selected for the salt containment will be pur-
chased with existing ORNL MET materials specifications developed for
the MSRE and with RDT standards as applicable. Other material will be
purchased with ORNL MET, RDT, and ASTM standards and specifications, as
applicable. The proposed material specifications are given in the

Appendix.

6.1.3 Fabrication and Installation

 

High quelity welding, quality control, inspection procedures, and a
record system, as defined by MSRE Quality Assurance Standards, and modi-
fied where necessary, will be used to fabricate and install all the salt-
containing equipment. Other fabrication and installation procedures
developed by Osk Ridge National Laboratory will be used as required. The

applicable procedures are given in the Appendix.

6.1.4 Operations
Step-by-step instructions contained in carefully planned procedures,

developed by engineers experienced in molten salt pump operation at ORNL,
will be used during startup, operation, and shutdown of the pump test stand.
37

6.2 Quality Assurance

A quality assurance program will be devised and enforced to provide
confidence that the test stand will operate satisfactorily in service.

It will provide assurance that the design is adequate to meet defined and
agreed-upon requirements, that construction is carried out in accordance
with the design through the use of written procedures to guide trained
craft personnel, and that the stand will be operated and maintained
according to written procedures to provide reliable performance.

The quality assurance program for the test stand will be essentially
the program developed between 1961 and 1965 for the MSRE and modified as
required. This integrated quality assurance program utilizing procedural
documents for the procurement of materials, fabrication, installation,
cleanliness, inspection and testing, and record keeping, was a pioneering
successful effort in the field of quality assurance. These procedural
documents were devised so that they would be enforceable and auditable.
As a result, all of these MSRE quality assurance documents, complete in
detall, are filed and available for auditing.

The MSRE quality assurance program is a proven program that produces
high-quality components and systems for nuclear applications at a reason-
able cost. It is a practical program where good judgment in the appli-
cation of quality assurance eliminated many unneeded and costly require-

ments.
Since there is no other quality assurance program of proven value

for molten salt systems, it appears prudent to utilize this available
knowledge and experience for design and construction of the pump test

stand.

6.3 Quality Assurance Program

A discussion of the various elements of the quality assurance pro-
gram is presented, including system management, the requirements for
quality assurance and control during design, fabrication, assembly,
testing operation and maintenance, and the plans for quality assurance
records and system audit. Figure 7 presents briefly the roles and res-
ponsibilities of the various groups who will provide the quality assurance

program for the pump test stand.
