Ethanol-Alkaline Hydroxide-Water Systems
Giorgio Peyrounal (Univ. Milano, Italy)
Gazz. chim. ital. 79, T92-9(1949)

The zones of immiscibility of ag. alc. solns. of KOH and NaOH at 17°,
30°, 60°, and 90° were studied. KOH and NaOH showed considerably
different behavior. In the aq. stratum, NaOH showed at sstn. at all
temps. a greater degree of hydration than did KOH. This is contrary

to their behavior in pure ag. solns., and is explained by traces of
EtOH, which break the mol. assocn. of the NaOH. In pure satd. ag.
solns., these bonds between NaOH - 2 HpO groups are stable at room
temp. At 179, satd. solns. of NaOH are in equil. with the phase

3 NaOH - (3) HpO + EtOH, where only the No. (3) of the HpO mols. is
uncertain. Correspondingly satns. of KOH are in equil. with the phase
KOH - 2 Hp0. In the upper alc. strata, there is for NaQH an extension
of the zone of the immiscibility which increases with rise in temp. for
both systems, but more strongly for NaOH than for KOH. This 1s explain-
ed by a breakdown of the NaOH-EtOH assocn., which is affected more by
temp. than is the EtOH-KOH assocn. However, with KOH, this scission
takes place at 60°, because solid KOH - 2 EtOH m. at this temp. and
forms 2 strata. Between 60° and 90° no further dissocecn. is evident,
whereas, with NaOH, dissocn. continues progressively from 60° to 90°.
The results explain the different behaviors of NaCH and KOH in concd.
solns. contg. org. compds. with COO groups or OH groups, and the grester
tendency of NaOH to form addn. compds.

H. IL. Johnston and T. W. Bauer

J. Am. Chem. Soc. 73, 1119-22(1951)

The heat capacity of Lis0 was measured over the temp. range 16 to 3049K.
Graphic integration of the heat-capacity curve yielded 9.06 + 0.03 cal./
mole/degree for the entropy at 25°. When the entropies of LICH and of
steam were also considered, the curve yielded a ASP value of 33.70 +
0.12 e.u. for the dissocn. reaction 2 Li0H = Lip0 + HoO (gas). This
latter value is in good agreement with the value 33.85 obtained from the
dissocn. equil. and confirms the application of the 3rd law of thermo-
dynamics to LipO. A tsble of thermodynamic functions for Lip0 was prepd.

Investigation of the Hydrogen Bond of Aqueous Solutions of Hydroxides by
the Method of Combination Scattering of Light

M. I. Batuev

Doklady Akad. Nauk S.S.S.R. 59, 715-18(1948)

In the spectra of highly concd. aq. solns. of KOH and NaOH (40 wt.-%)
there appears on the short-wave edge of the wide HoO band a sharply
prominent, although somewhat broadened line at 3630 em. -X. This line
gradually fades with decreasing concn. (down to 0.5 wt.-%) and dis-
appears. In its place a faint band appears at about 3950 cm. Lt. These
findings indicate that the quasicryst. structure is present in concd.
solns. and is destroyed with increasing diln. and dissocn. The OH ion
forms H bonds even in cryst. and quasicryst. labtices; therefore, it is
not a free ion. The high-frequency OH band is absent in the spectrum
of pure, distd. water kept in quartz vessels. The different chem.
nature of the OH groups of acids and of bases is gpparent from the

fact that the optical evidence of the H bond appears at a higher fre-
quency in bases (4200-3600 cm.-l) than in acids (3600-2800 cm."1).

The Passivating Characteristics of the Stainless Steels
W. G. Renshaw and J. A. Ferree
Corrosion 7, h00-1 (1951)

In all of the expts. relating to air passivation, specimens were held in
alr except at the instant when potential measurements were made. Where
passivation in HNO3, H3POh, or NaOH soln. was involved; specimens vere
continuously held in these solns. after sctivation. Potential measure-
ments do not necessarily reflect practical experience in every case. The
measuring equipment used is described; a wiring diagram is given for the
vacuum tube voltmeter, and further details of the tests. For general
corrosion resistance there is no better passivating sgent than air, but
the surface must be clean and free from scale before passivation. This
is secured by the usual pickling treatment or by treatment with 20% warm
HNO3 soln. Stainless steel is not usually recommended unless the corro-
give medium handled is capsble of promoting and maintaining a passive
surface on the metal during service.

Concn. distributions were measured in the continuous countercurrent

dialysis of 20 wt.% NsOH in order to asSess’the mass transfer in terms of
dialysis coeffs. appropriate to specific positions along the contact

path. For design purposes it is adequate to use an over-all coeff.
based on the logarithmic mean of the terminal conen. differences
between the lye and water cells. It was shown that the reduction of
relative resistance to transfer in the liquor films and in the uemorane
will increase the over-all dialysis coeff.

Caustic Alkall by Electrolysis
G. Passelecqg
Fr. 963,354, July 6, 1950

Chlorides of alkali metals, made as pure as possible, are electrolyzed
in ag. soln. in an app. consisting of a small cell (A) having graphite
anodes, an anode of Hg-Na amalgam having at least 1% Na, and an ag.
501n. of the pure chloride as electrolyte, and a much larger cell which
is divided into two parts, (B) and (C). An anode of graphite in ag.
chlorides is in (B), and an Fe cathode in NaOH goln. is in (C), which
is 2, 3, or 4 times larger than (B). The amalgam passes by gravity
from (A) to (B) to (C), a weir lying between (B) and (C) so that {(C)
gets an amalgam of the highest Wa content, and the amalgam in (C) is
spread over as large an area as possible. A pump passes the amslgam
from (C) to (A). The cell (B-C) runs at 10,000 amp. end 2.8-2.9 v.;
(C) at 300-500 amp. and 4 v.

BeO, Alp03;, and LapO3 absorb HpO when melted and release it with eruption
upon solidification. The technique for the manuf. of artificial rubies.
prevents HoO from interfering with the process in this manner. The same
phenomenon occurs slightly with ZrOp, but not at all with a mixt. of
Pro03, Ndp03, and YbpO3 or with Cal, MgO, or ThOp. Since the temp. is
above 2000°, the HoO must be chemically bound to the oxide; consequently
gaseous hydroxide and hydroxide in soln. in the oxide melt must be ;
present. The heat of formation of gaseous Be(OH)p and the heat of
volatilization of Be(0H)p aré calcd. to Be approx. ~47 kcal. and -60
kcal.; resp., from the data of Hutchison and Malm on the volatilization
of BeO in the presence of HpO vapor (CA 43, 5321h). Al203 is more
volatile in the presence of HpO vapor than in dry air, so gaseous
Al{0H)3 is also stable.

Oxidation of Ni(OH)o by a current of air in the presence of NapS0
increases with the amt. of NapS0g added up to a certain limit, ebove
which there is no further increase of the percentage of oxidation.

The greater the quantity of NapS0q used, the longer is the time requir-
ed for initiating the oxidation. Variation of the concn. of Ni(OH)s
does not vary the percentage of oxidation; hence, some definite compd.
is formed. Glucose retards the oxidation; sucrose, even more.

Alkali Metal Hydroxides

A method of producing an alkali metal hydroxide(I), e.g., NaOH, soln.
from Ca(OH)p and an alkali metal halide (II), e.g., NaCl, by exchange
of ions comprises passing an aq. soln. of ca{0H)s into contact with a
halide of a HpO-insol., strongly basic, anion-exchange resin (III) t
absorb OH ions and then treating (III) with an ag. soln. of II of -
least 10 wt.$ concen. to effect displacement of the absorbed OH ions with
formation of an aq. soln. of 5-15 Wt.% or more of I. III, which is a
quaternary ammonium base or a salt thereof, may be prepd. by the reaction
of a halomethylating agent (IV), e.g., chloro- or bromo-methyl methyl
ether, and the normally solid CgHg-insol. copolymers of monovinyl aro-
matic compds. (V), e.g., styrene, ar-methyl-, ar-chloro-, or ar-
dimethylstyrenes, or vinyl-, or ar-methylvinylnaphthalenes, and a poly-
vinyl aromatic compds. (VI), e.g., divinylbenzenes, or -naphthslenes,
ar-divinyltoluenes, -xylenes, or -ethylbenzenes, which co-polymers may
contain 0.5-20% by wt. of VI chemically combined, e.g., interpolymerized
with V. Then the halomethylated vinyl aromatic resin is treated with a
tertiary amine (VII), preferably a tertiary mono- or dialkyl N-substituted
alkanol or alkanediol amine by dispersion in a liquid, e.g., HpO, acetone
EtOH, at 25-100° for 4 hrs. to form a quaternary ammonium halide, which
is washed with H»O, or preferably with an org. liquid, e.g., acetone,
EtOH, or dioxane, and then with HpO0. VII may be dimethylethanoclamine,
methyldiethanolamine, dimethyliscpropanolamine, methyldiisopropenclamine,
and l-dimethylamino 2,3-propsnediol. The hsalomethylating reaction may
‘be carried out at room temp. or above in the presence of a catalyst, e.g.,
ZnClp, ZnO, SnCly, AlCl3, Zn, Sn, or Fe, while the copolymer is swollen
by, or dispersed in, an org. liquid, e.g., an excess of IV, that is less
reactive with IV than is the polymer. The method also may be used to
cone. weak {0.1-3%) ag. NaDH or KOH and to recover more concd. NaOH from
waste liquor from pulp and paper industries.

Behavior of a Mixture of Negatively Charged Colloidal Iron and Chromium
Hydroxides

E. H. Daruwalla and G. M. Nabar (Univ. Bombay)

Kolloid-z. 127, 33-8(1952)

The stability of Fe(0H)p, Fe (OH) 3, and Cr(OH),, prepd. by reaction of
FeS0y, FeCls, Cro(SOy)3 with definite amts. of NaOH, was detd. in the
presence of Jnonelectrolytes, (peptizing agents, suger, glycerol) and
electrolytes (pptg. agents, NapSOy, MgSO), Alp(SOy),). For peptizing a
metal hydroxide, sufficient nonelectrolyte must be Present before the
alkali is added to the metal salt. Also an excess of alkali, above that
needed theoretically for pptn. of the hydroxide, is necessary to obtain
the metal hydroxide in colloidal soln. When the NaOH conen. is increased
progressively, the min. amb. of nonelectrolyte required to peptize a
given amt. of Fe(OH) 1 decreases gradually to a const. value. Glyesrol
is unsuitable for peptizing Fe(OH), but it can peptize Cr{O0H), even at
relatively high concng. However, Fe (0H) can be easily peptizéd by
glycerol in the presence of Cr{(OH)z. The min. quantities of NaOH and
sugar required for peptization of a mixt. of Fe (OH) 3 and Cr{OH)3 are
greater than the sums of these reagents necessary to peptize like amts

of the individual metal hydroxides. The mixed colloidal hydroxides are
more stable to pptn. by dialysis than are the individual hydroxides.
These observations point to the possibility of formation of a complex
when a mixt. of 2 metal hydroxides is peptized.

The Cathodic Corrosion of Iron and the Formation of Crystallized Ferrite
at the Anode during Electrolysis of Molten Sodium Hydroxide

M. Dodero (Inst. electrochem., Grenoble, France)

J. chim. phys. 49, €210-13(1952)

The electrolysis of molten NaOH between 500° and 750° leads under certain
conditions to cathodic corrosion and deposition of Na ferrite on the anode.
The cathodic corrosion is explained by assuming the formation of FeOoH™
ions and by a transfer of electrons from the soln. to the cathode, opposite
to the usual transfer. The formation of ferrite was assumed to result from
the secondary reaction which occurred after transfer of electrons from the
OH" and FeOoH™ ions to the anode. No corrosion occurred when a.c. was used.

Structural Study of the Dehydration of Magnesium Hydroxide
Julio Garrido
Ton 11, 453-64(1951); ef. CA 45, 9980a

Continuation of earlier work. To account for the x-ray spectra, 2 dif-
ferently oriented reciprocal lattices must be postulated. These 2 lattices
correspond to 2 orientations of the crystallites in which the (111) planes
are common to both. The 2 systems of crystallites sre characterized as
orientation I with (110) of MgO parallel to (1010) of Mg(CH)s, (111) to
(0001), and (100) to (1011), and orientation II with (110) and (111) as in
I end with (100) parallel to (1101). After dehydration at 500°, 75-80% of
the crystallites are in orientation I. Rapid dehydration at higher temps.
(2.80, 700°) produces supplementary spectra that do not correspond to the
MgO lattice; these spectra are found in positions corresponding to reflec.
tion with respect to the (111) plane of MgO. At still higher temps. (20000)
the supplementary spectrs disappear and only the lines corresponding to
orientation I are found. The possible origins of the supplementary spzctra
gre discussed; a mechanism based on the existence of vacant lattice sites
iz considered most plausible. The product of the dehydration retains the
superficial form and size of the original crystal; the individual crystai-
lites appear to be larger than 0.0001 mm., although some evidence points
to sizes of the order of 50 to 100 A. The way in which the breaking of
Mg-0 bonds leads preferentially to nuclei of orientation I is discussed.

Absorption of Carbon Dioxide by Solutions of Sodium Hydroxide and Sodium

cf. CA 46, 3835e

The method described for the quant. investigation of the kinetics of
absorption during intensive mixing (with the magnitude of the phase
interface being unknown) is based on the maintenance of a const. phase
interface by the choice of temps. and concns. that correspond to the
const. phys. properties of the absorbent. If a high degree of turbu-
lence is assumed, the following relations hold for the absorption of
Cop oy NaOH and NapCO3 solns.: q = dw/o~. at = gp [KC + wn] / {KC + vy,
+ (B/H)], in which gq = rate of absorption per unit of time per unit of
interface surface; B = the hydrodynamic const, of the gas phase of the
const. of the rate of diffusion in the gas phase; p = the partial
pressure of COp; K = Kevp &T; Keo = const. of the velocity of the chem.
reaction; vn = the hydrodynamic const.; AT= the period of renewal of
the surface layer; C = the conen. of the chemically active component
of the soln.; H = the soly. coeff. Exptl. results showed that at high
turbulence the rate of sbsorption was proportional to the partial
pressure and that the concen. of the absorbent had a slight effect on
the rate of absorption. Under such conditions an increase in C result-
ed in a reduction of gq in those cases in which an sbsorption process
and a slower chem. reaction were involved. It follows that the COp
dissolved in the vol. of the liquid phase does not react.
