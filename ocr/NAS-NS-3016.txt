FOREWORD

The Subcommittee on Radlochemistry is one of a number of
subcommittees working under the Committee on Nuclear Science
within the National Academy of Sciences - National Research
Council. Its members represent government, industrial, and
"university laboratories in the areas of nuclear chemistry
and analytical chemistry.

The Subcommittee has concerned itself with those areas of
nuclear science which involve the chemist, such as the col-
lection and distribution of radiochemical procedures, the
egtablishment of specifications for radlochemically pure
reagents, the problems of stockpiling uncontaminated
materials, the availability of cyclotron time for service
irradiations, the place of radiochemistry in the undergraduate
college program, etc.

This serles of monographs has grown out of the need for up-
to-date ¢ ilations of radiochemical information and pro-
cedures.. e Subcommittee has endeavored to present a
series which will be of maximum use to the working sclentist
and which contains the latest available information. Each
monograph collects in one volume the pertinent information
required for radiochemical work with an individual element
or a group of closely related elements.

An expert in the radiochemlstry of the particular element
has written the monograph, following a standard format
developed by the Subcommittee. The Atomic Energy Commis-
sion has sponsored the printing of the series.

The Subcommittee is confident these publications will be
useful not only to the radiochemist but also to the research
worker in other fields such as physics, biochemistry or
medicine who wishes to use radiochemical techniques to solve
a specific problem.

INTRODUCTION

This volume which deals with the radiochemistry of prot-
actinium is one of a series of monographs on radiochemistry
of the elements. There is included a review of the nuclear
and chemical features of particular interest to the radio-
chemist, a dlscussion of problems of dissolution of a sample
and counting techniques, and finally, a collection of radio-
chemical procedures for the element as found in the literature.

The series of monographs will cover all elements for which
radiochemical procedures are pertinent. Plans include
revision of the monograph periodically as new techniques and
procedures warrant. The reader is therefore encouraged to
call to the attention of the author any published or unpub-
lished material on the radiochemistry of protactinium which
might be included in a revised version of the monograph.

Any new review on protactinium at this time has been rendered
largely superfluous by the recent publication of the critical
article by Haissinsky and Bouissieres!. This excellent
comprehensive monograph covers the published (and much of the
unpublished)literature through November 1, 1957. Except for
translation from the French, it can hardly be improved upon.
Such a translation has been made, and it is hoped that per-
mission for its general distribution will be granted by the
publisher in the near future. .

The present report has the limited objective of acquainting
the reader with the broad outlines of protactinium chemistry,
especially in relation to methods of preparation, separation,
and analysis. The literature survey bas been limited to
materlal reported since about 1950; for the older literature,
the author has relied heavily on the Haisslnsky-Bouissieres
review. Critical comments, however, are those of this
writer. Patents, as such, have been largely ignored, as in
the opinion of the author, thelr significance is more legal
than scientific. .

III. CHEMISTRY OF PROTACTINIUM

1. General

The only naturally occurring protactinium isotopes are prot-

actinium-231 and protactinium-234.

Because of their short
half-lives, 1.2-minute protactinium-234 (UXy) and its 6.7-hour
isomer (UZ) are of relatively little interest to radiochemists,
The 27-day protactinium-233 is readily produced by neutron
irradiation of thorium and 1s of considerable value both as

a tracer and as the parent of fissile uranium-233. Signifi-
cantly, the y-p branching ratio of UXp; was determined with the

aid of protactinium-233 as a tracer.’

Although the natural abundance of protactinium is almost as
great as that of radium, the lknmown world supply of the iso-
lated element and its compounds did not exceed one or two

grams until the late 1950's.

Interest in thorium breeder reactors gave necessary lmpetus
to the recovery of gram quantities of protactinium for study

of its macrochemistry.

Abundant source material was avallable as a result of the
accelerated production of uranium for nuclear reactors.
Chemical technology (solvent extraction) and instrumentation
(scintillation spectrometers) had advanced to a point where
separations and analyses which were previously difficult or

impossible could be made with relative ease and rapidity.

Almost 100 grams of protactinium-231 was recently isolated
from uranium refinery wastes In Great Britain, and groups at
Cambridge, Harwell, and elsewhere are actively engaged in
studying the chemistry (as distinct from the radiochemistry)

of protactinium.
Dr. A. G. Maddock has kindly supplied this reviewer with an
unpublished report on the 1958 activities of the Cambridge
protactinium groupi?, in which he describes the preparation,
in centigram quantities, of the penta~ and tetrahalides of
protactinium and polarographic studies of its oxalate,
chloride, fluoride, and sulfate sclutions. These data will

be published shortly.

It is safe to predict that the 1960's will see much of the
mystery and witchcraft eliminated from protactinium chemistry.
Nevertheless, the greatest amount of information published to
date has come from work done with protactinium-233 on tracer

levels.

These data have not been consistently applicable to the
macrochemlstry of protactinium-231. To some extent, the
discrepancles are due to the origins of the isotopes. Prot-
actinium-233 1s likely to be contaminated only by thorlum.
Protactinium-231, on the other hand, may be contaminated
wlth any or all of the elements in groups IVa and Va of
the Periodic Table, as well as with phosphate ion, which
tends to make its chemistry somewhat erratic. Furthermore,
radiochemical analysls of protactinium-231 is complicated

by the presence of its own a-, B-, and y-active descendants

(Table II) and those of uranium-238.

Protactinium-231 can also be produced by the neutron irradia-
tion of thorium-230 (ionium), in which case it will usually

also be contaminated by thorium-232 and protactinium-233.

Too much has been made of the apparently capricious chemical

behavior of protactinium. In the pentavalent state, its

chemistry is similar to that of its homologues in group Va
of the Periodic Table. Like niobium and tantalum, prot-
actinium is almost completely insoluble in all the common
aqueous media except sulfuric and hydrofluoric acids. I+
1s readily precipitated by hydroxides and phosphates, and,
in trace quantities, 1s carried more or less quantitatively

by precipitates of a wide variety of elements.

The well-publicized tendency of protactinium to deposit on
the walls of glass vessels 1s primarily due to its insolubility;
this tendency 1s not apparent in appropriate concentrations of

gulfuric and hydrofluoric acids.

2, Metallic Protactinium

Metallic protactinium has been prepared by thermal decom-
position of its halides on a tungsten filament and by
electron bombardment of the oxidell, by reduction of the
tetrafluoride with barium at 1400°12, and by electrodeposi-
tion on various metal cathodes from very dilute, slightly
acid, fluoride solutionsl>,

The metal is grey in color, malleable, and approximately as
hard as uranium. On exposure to alr, it acquires a thin
skin of PaO.

3. Soluble Salts of Protactlnium

Nowhere 1s the literature of protactinium more confused or
ambiguous than in the references to its solubility in common

mineral acids. The only aystematic study in this area is the
14 with solution volumes of the

preliminary work of Thompson
order of 0,05 ml. (Table I1I). The avallability of gram
quantities of protactinium makes this a potentially fertlle

field for investigation.

‘The bast solvent for protactinium is hydrofluoric acid, which
readily dissolves the ignited pentoxide and nearly all pre-
cipitates, forming the stable complex ion PaF,”.
Protactinlum pentoxide disaolves slowly in hot concentrated
sulfuric acid, but the solubility 1s low. Prolonged diges-
tion convarts the oxide to a sulfate, which dissolves on
dilution of the acid.

A solution containing 17 mg./ml. of protactinium-231 in
approximately 7.7 N H,S0, has been stable for over a yearl5,
and one containing 36 mg./ml. in approximately 3 N D,SO, has
been stable for six monthel6,

In the author's experience, only hydrofluoric and sulfuric
acids permanently dissolve ‘appreciable quantities of prot-
actinium. With all other mineral acids, solutions are
unstable, resulting in precipitates or colloidal guspensiona’

after periods ranging from a few hours to several weeks.

Solutions containing 10-3 to 10°* M protactinium in 6 M HNO,
(0.2 - 0.02 mg. /ml.) hydrolyzed slowly, but, at concentra-
tions between 10-% and 10-7 M protactinium, the solutions
were sufficiently stable for 24 hours to yield reproducible

extraction and ion exchange datal?.

Although the literature is prolific of references to the

solvent extraction and ion exchange of protactinium from

# Reviewer'a Note:

This table is included because it is
the only one of its kind avallable.
recent experlence, however, the values, which were

based on volumes of the order of 0.05 ml., are highly
questionable.

In the light of

HC1 solutlons, no data other than Thompson's are given to

indicate the limits of solubility.

The insolubility of prot-

actinium in 6-8N HCl is useful as a method of separation from

decay products:

When the lodate precipitate of protactinium

1s digested with concentrated KCl, the protactinium dissolves

temporarily, then reprecipitates quantitatively.

After
digestion on a hot water bath and centrifugation, the super-
nate contains no detectable protactiniuml?, |

Where an occaslonal reference occurs to solubllities of the
order of 1 mg. /mL. of protactinium in 6 N rc1lS, it must be
regarded as questionable. When elaborate precautions are
taken to eliminate organic complexing agents and fluoride
ion, the subsequent HCl solutions are unstable. A solution
containing 2 mg./ml. of protactinium, in 8 M HCl was prepared
from a peroxide precipitate, but, over a period of three

weeks, about 80 per cent of the protactinlum precipitated!?,

4. Insoluble Salts Useful in Separation and Analysis

The normal oxidation state of protactinlum is + 5, but prot-
actinium (V) probably does not exist in solution as a simple
cation. On reduction to protactinium (IV) [e.g., with zinc
amalgam], the fluoride can be precipitated and is insoluble
in water and most acids. Tetravalent protactinium is slowly
oxidized in air to the pentavalent state, and the fluoride

redissolves?C,

Protactinium (V) can be precipitated from fluoride solution
by the addition of a stoichiometric amount of KF, which forms
an Insoluble double fluoride, K PaF,. A double fluoride with

barium has also been reported?l,

Alkall hydroxides and carbonates precipitate protactinium in
both oxidation states, and the precipitate 1s not soluble in
excess of the reagent. Depending on the concentrations,

NH, OH mav fail to precipitate protactinium quantitatively

from fluoride solution?

10
The phosphate and hypophosphate of protactinium can be pre-
cipitated from acid solutions. ‘It has been reported that the
precipitate wlll not redissolve even in strong mineral aclds.
However, ‘the author has regularly redissolved protactinium
precipitated by phosphate, whether in trace amounts carried

by titanium or niobium, or in carrier-free milligram quantities.
The precipitate, upon digestion with a sufficient quantity of
warm 18 N H5504 either dissolves or becomes soluble on dilu-

tion with HCl to which some H,0, has been added.

The phosphate can alsc be precipitated from fluoride solution,
depending upon the relative concentrations of the anions. If
excess phosphate is separated by filtration or centrifugation,

the protactinium is soluble in dilute HF.

Iodates precipitate both protactinium (IV) and protactinium
(V) from moderately acid solution (e.g., 5 N H,504). The precip-

ltate is gelatinous and voluminous, but becomes more dense on

standing, especially if it is warmed on a water bath. Iodate
precipitation from acid solution provides excellent separation

from phosphate.

Sodium phenylarsenate precipitates protectinium in either
oxidation state; the gelatinous precipitate is readlly soluble
in dilute FC,

Dilution of a sulfuric acid solution of protactinium(V)
produces a precipitate which redissolves in ammonium sul-
fate. Potassium sulfate, however, yields a crystalline pre-

clpitate, probably a double sulfate.

Tartaric and citric acids dissolye the hydroxides of both

protactinium(V) and protactinium(IV), and the solution 1s

11
stable on the addition of NH, OH. Sodium hydroxide precipi-
tates protactinium from a citrate, but not from a tartrate

solution.

With Hy;0, in large excess, protactinium(V) forms a precipitate

which ie insoluble in NH OH and NaOH. The precipitate is

i
soluble in dilute H,S0, only after decomposition of the per-

oxide on a water bath.

Freshly precipltated protactinium hydroxide dissolved rapidly
in warm aqueous oxalic actad®>, Addition of NH, OH to J M H,C.0,
containing 0.15 mg./ml. of protactinium resulted in persistent
turbidity at pH 5-6, but precipitation was not complete until
pH 8-9 was reached. Addition of an equal volume of 1 N HCL

to the original oxalate solution had no effect in the cold,

but a white crystalline precipitate contalning approximately

90 per cent of the protactinium was formed in warm solutions.

This precipitate dissolved completely in 8 N HCl.

In general, protactinium(V) follows the chemistry of niobium,

while protactinium(IV) follows that of thorium.

5. Coprecipitation and Carrying of Protactinium

Most methods for the recovery of either protactinium-231 or
protactinium-233 rely, for an initial concentration step, on
the entrainment of protactinium by an insoluble carrier of
another element. From the foregoing discussion of insoluble
compounds of protactinium, it follows that hydroxide, carbon-
ate, or phosphate precipitates of tantalum, zirconium, niobium,

hafnium, and titanium will carry protactinium quantitatively,
or nearly so. In addition, protactinium is carried by most
other flocculent hydroxides (e.g., calcium and iron), probably

by adsorption rather than by isomorphous replacement.

Protactinium is carried by MnO, produced by the addition of

KMnO, to a dilute HNO, solution containing Mn (NO; ) In

3 2°
solutions of high lonic strength the entrainment is not com-
pletely quantitative, but it becomes more so as the precipi-

tate 1s repeatedly redissolved and fractionally precipitated.

Since titanium and zirconium are also carried, these
impurities, 1f present, can serve as carriers for the sep-

aration from manganese”,

6. Solvent Extraction of Protactinium

At tracer levels (10° - 10-10

M) protactinium is extracted,
to some extent, from hydrochloric, nitric, sulfuric and even
perchloric acld solutions by a wilde variety of unrelated
organic solvents. At the macro level (ca. 1 mg./ml.) the

roster of effective extractants 1s more exclusive.

In general, protactinium is extracted readily by long-chain
alcohols and certain ketones, but poorly by the lower ethers.
Extractions from aqueous chloride media give better ylelds
and more reproducible results than those made from nitrate
solutions??. This would follow from the relative rates of

hydrolysis previously noted.

Maddock and his co-workers (18, 19, 21, 26, 27, 28) have

studied the extraction of protactinium from hydrochloric acid
by various organic solvents (Figure 1). For extraction of

macro amounts, they found diisopropyl ketone most satisfactory,

but  diisobutyl ketone was used because it was commercially

available.

Regardless of the organic solvent used, protactinium (V)
exhibits its highest distribution coefficients from strongly
acid aqueous media, consistent with its existence in aqueous
solution as a complex anion. In this respect, it resembles
most of the elements of groups IVa and Va of the Periodic
Table. Thorium and uranium, which can be extracted from
solutions of low acidity with the aid of salting agents,

can, therefore, be easily separated.

In this laboratory, solvent extraction of protactinium has
been largely confined to diisobutyl carbinol diluted with
kerosene or benzene, primarily because of the extremely
high distribution coefficients, capaclty, and decontamina-
tion attainable with this solvent.

The author does not subscribe to the hypothesis of a soluble
but inexcractable gpecles of protactinium??. In numerous
extractions of solutions containing both traces and milli-
grams of protactinium per milliliter, no such phenomenon
has been observed so long as the protactinium was in true
solution and fluoride ion wae absent. A transient species,

preliminary to hydrolysis, remains a possibility.

The following conditions have ylelded apparently inextract-
able protactinium: (a) the "protactinium"™ was actually
actinium-227 and its decay products; (b) fluoride ion was
present; (c) the solution was colloidal; (d) interfering
elements (e.g., niobium and iron) were present in large

amounts and were preferentially extracted; (e) the organic

15
solvent was excessively soluble in the aqueous phase (usua-
1ly due to insufficient diluent); and (f) there was insuf-
ficient sulfuric acld or hydrochloric acid to complex both

protactinium and the impurities.

It has been suggested that a polymer of protactinium alone

26,30 renders the protactinium

or of protactinium with niobium
inextractable or reduces the distribution coefficient. Such
a suggestion 1s untenable unless the polymer is regarded as
the precursor of a colloid or a preclpitate. As has been
stated previously, aqueous solutions (other than sulfate or
fluoride solutions) contalning macro amounts of protactinium

invariably yield precipltates after a perlod of time varying

from a few hours to several weeksl?» 19,

It is significant to note that, whenever protactinium 1s
extracted from an acid phase containing only hydrochloric
or nitric acid, investigators report that the extractions
are carried out soon after dissolution of the protactinium
[or after addition of fluorilde-complexing cations such as
aluminum (III) or boron (III)]. Aging of these solutions
increases the percentage of the "inextractable species", a’
behavior consistent with slow hydrolysis and formation of

a colloid.

The addition of sulfuric acid, originally recommended by
Moore30 to break a "nonextractable complex of niobium-
protactinlum oxalate", has been found to be necessary for
the complete extraction of protactinium by dilisobutyl
carbinol even in the abserice of niobium!S, The precise

conditions required have not yet been fully determined,

16
but an aqueous phase containing 9 N #,50, - 6 N HCl has
been useful for all protactinium concentrations and degrees
of purity. Solutions containing up to 20 mg./ml. of prot-
actinium in dilsobutyl carbinol have been prepared.

The extraction of protactinium-233 from nitric acid by
dilsobutyl carbinol has been examined, and high decon-
tamination factors for uranium, thorium, zirconium, nio-

bium, and rare earths are reported’.

appears in the feed effluent.

the Zr preceding the Pa. Niobium(V) is eluted with

9 M HC1-0.18 M HF. Tantalum(V) is eluted with 1 M HF-4M

actinium(V) in trace amounts can, therefore, be purified
to a considerable extent by this method. The protactinium
eluted in solutions containing HF can be resorbed if HBO,

or AlCl, 1s added to complex the fluoride?

Hardy and co-workers’ have studied the ion exchange of
1079 M protactinium from HNO, solutions in batch experi-
ments with ZeoKarb 225 cation resin and DeAcidite FF anion

resin in the H' and NO, = forms, respectively (Figures 7

22
and 8). Equilibrium between the catlon resin and 6 M HNO,
was reached within 15 minutes, about 73 per cent of the
protactinium being adsorbed. About 95 per cent of the
protactinium was adsorbed on the anion resin after one to
two hours. The same investigators found that, from a 10-5 M
protactinium solution in 0.01 M HF-6 M HNO, 16 per cent of
the protactinium was adsorbed on ZeoKarb 225 cation resin

and 75 per cent on DeAcidite FF anlon resin.

On the other hand, the author!’ has found that 1077 M
protactinium-231 in 0.05 M HF-1 M HNO, or in 0.004 M HF-

0.04 M HNO, passes freely through a column of Dowex-50

cation resin. Whereas the decay products, actinium-227,
thorium-227, and radium-223, are quantitatively adsorbed,
more than 99.5 per cent of the protactinium-231 appears

in the effluent.

co-workers . They report that the onset of hydrolysis
and disappearance of the solvent extractability of prot-
actinium coincide with the appearance of an absorption band
with its maximum at 260 mu. (Figure 9). In 2.4 - 11.8 M

displaced to 217.5 mu, and, in 9 - 18 M acid, it was
resolved into two components at about 212.5 and 220 mu.

IV. DISSOLUTION OF PROTACTINIUM SAMPLES

Protactinium-233 or protactinium-231 made by neutron irrad-
iation of Th-232 or Th-230 offers no special problem other
than that of dissolving the thorium. Concentrated HNO
containing 0.01 M HF will dissolve thorium without render-
ing it passived2, The HF alsc insures the solubility of

protactinium.

28
In the case of Pa?3l from natural sources; the variety of

these sources defies any attempt to offer a general dissolu-
tion procedure. Typically, residues from processes for
recovering uranium. and/or radium contain oxides of Si, Fe,
Pb, Al, Mn, Ca, Mg, Ti, and Zr, and a random selection of
trace elements which are usually more abundant than prot-
actinium. Virgin pitchblende or other uranium ores will

contain other elements as well, usually in a refractory

condition.

Hahn and Meitner? mixed a siliceous residue with Tay05
and fused the mixture with NaHS0,, After washing the

cooled melt with water, they dissolved the Pa and Ta in HF.

Pitchblende was digested with a mixture of HNO, and H,50,,

"and the digestion liquor was treated with asco". The
protactinium in the carbonate precipitate remained insoluble
when the carbonates were dissolved in excess HNO. When

the washed residue from the HNO, treatment was digested
with a mixture of HF and H,S0,, at an elevated temperature,
over 90% of the protactinium went into solution, while tne

bulk of the residne remalned insoluble.

A slliceous material consisting mainly of lead, barium, and
calcium sulfates was digested with 60% oleum, and the sul-
fates dissolved. The siliceous residue, containing the
protactinlum, was separated and dissolved in HF. Alterna-
tively, the original material was attacked with 40% HF,
dissolving the Pa and leaving the heavy-metal sulfates as

residue?l,

Depending upon the amount of material to be processed,
alkaline fusions are sometimes useful in separating large

amounts of silica, etc., while leaving the Pa insoluble.

29
In general, the following treatments can be recommended, in

the order given:

1. Digest the material with strong HCl to remove

© Fe.

2. Digest the residue from the HCl treatment with

hot, concentrated H,S0,,.

J. Digest the residue from the H,S0, treatment
with 25-48% HF or a mixture of HF and H,SO,.

Lk. Digest the residue with a hot mixture of HNO

and H,50,,.
5. Digest the residue with hot 40-50% NaOH.
6. Fuse the residue with Na,C0,, NaOH, KOH,
or KHSO,, .

Throughout the dissolution, the fractions should be examined
by gamma-ray spectrometry, as the 27 kev peak of protactinium-
231 is unique and distinctive (Figure 11).

While pa233 has sometimes been used as a tracer to follow
"the course of the Pa23l digsolution?l, it is doubtful that
isotopic exchange takes place to a great extent between a

refractory solid and a tracer-contalning solution.

life of 1.62 x 10° years’. The princlpal beta energies
in mev are: 0.15 (37 per cent), 0.257 (58 per cent), and
0.568 (five per cent)35. The gamma spectrum is shown in

Figure 1256,

In most work, only relative values of protactinium-233 are
needed, hence the counting problems are essentially the
same ag with other relatively weak beta-emitters; self-
absorption, geometry, and backscattering must be carefully
controlled: For the absolute determination of pure prot-
actinium-233, a method based on its growth from neptunlum-
237 has been suggested’. Here, a highly purified sample
of neptunium-237 1s electrodeposited and allowed to decay.’
The beta-counting rate of protactinium-233 is compared with
the alpha-counting rate of neptunium-237 and the counting
efficiency calculated from the theoretical growth curve.
Alternatively, the neptunium-237 may be permitted to decay
to secular equilibrium, when the disintegration rates of

the two lsotopes are equal.

A simpler and more versatile method>8 consists of standard-
izing a scintillation gamma counter with a solution of
purified protactinium-233 whose disintegration rate has been
determined in a 47 beta counter. A scintillation spectro-
meter is useful for identifying and determining protactinium-
233 in the presence of other activities. Correction for
interference by Compton conversion electrons must be made

if more energetic gamma rays are present.

2. Protactinium-231

Protactinium-231 decays by alpha emission to actinium-227,
also an alpha emitter (Table II). The half-life has been

32
reported to be 34,300 years>?, and 32,000 yearsZ2. A recent
calorimetric measurement on approximately 0.5 gram of prot-

actinium pentoxidel5 yielded a value of 32,480 * 260 years.

Protactinium-231 has ten groups of alpha particles, of which
L3 per cent have energles below 5.0 mev. This fact, combined
‘with its low specific activity (about 50 me/g), makes prot-
actinium-231 alpha counting especlally susceptlble to self-
absorption. Care must be taken to keep the radioactive
deposit as thin as possible. A higher degree of counting
precision is attainable with a proportional alpha counter
than with either a parallel-plate alr-ionlzation counter or

a zine sulfide scintillation counter. .

Ideally, the alpha plateau should be determined individually
for each sample, but this is a tedious and time-consuming
procedure. The following mounting and counting technique
has been found to give high alpha-counting precisionl’:

Transfer one ml. or less of a fluoride solution
of protactinium-231 to a platinum or gold plate,
or to a stainless steel disk coated with a thin
plastic film (a clear plastic spray coating or a
~ dilute collodion solution is convenient for this
purpose). Evaporate the solution to dryness
under an infrared lamp, tilting the plate as
necessary to retain the solution in the center
of the plate. Cool the plate and cover the resi-
due with one ml. of 0.1 N HNO, « Add one drop of
concentrated NH, OH and again evaporate the solu-

tion to dryness. Lower the lamp sufficiently to
drive off all the NH,NO,, and ignite the plate

33
over a flame until the organic coating has burned
off (or, 1f gold or platinum was used, lignite to

just below red heat).

Determine the alpha plateau of the proportional
counter by counting a standard alpha source
(Pu?3?, radium D-E-F, or Po2l?) at 50-volt inter-
vals. At the high-voltage end of the alpha
plateau, count a sample of sr20/y90 at 25-volt
intervals, and find the voltage below which only

0.01 per cent of the betas are counted. The
protactinium-231 sample can be counted at this

point with good precision and no significant

interference from beta emitters.

A gamma-ray scintillation spectrometer is virtually a
necessity in modern work with protactinium-231. The 27,
95, and 300 kev photopeaks (Figure 11) are characteristic,
and the 27 kev peak in particular is unique in the gamma
spectra of the naturally occurring radioisotopes. (Compare

Figures 13 through 16.)

The sensitivity of this method of detection is shown in
Figure 17, where 0.2 ppm of protactinium-231 is positively
identified in a uranium refinery residue by the presence

of the distinctive photopeak at 27 kev.

The high susceptibility of the 27 kev peak to absorption
precludes its use for the quantitative determination of
protactinium-231, but it is particularly valuable in the
preliminary dissolution of a raw material. The 300 kev peak
is useful for quantitative work if correction is made for
the contribution of decay products and other gamma-active

materials.

VI. DETAILED RADIOCHEMICAL PROCEDURES FOR PROTACTINIUM

Procedure 1

"Preparation of carrier-free protactinium-233", according to
J. Golden and A. G. Maddock, J. Inorg. Nucl. Chem. 2, 46 (1956)

Protactinium-233 was prepared by the neutron irradiation of
samples of acid-insoluble thorium carbonate. This material,
of uncertain composition, 1s reasonably thermally stable, but
completely soluble in dilute HNP, and HCl. After irradiation
the material was dissolved in 8 N HCl and extracted with dliiso-
propyl ketone (DIPK). The extract was treated with 2 N HCl,

when the Pa passed back to the aqueous layer. The aqueous

37
Procedure 1 (Continued)
extract was then made 8 N again and the extraction repeated.
The protactinium was kept in solution in 8 N HCl in a poly-
ethylene vessel. It was observed that losses by adsorption
quickly took place on the walls of glass containers even with

solutions of the chloride complex in DIPK,

Better recoveries were obtained if the irradiated carbonate

was dissolved in 8 N HF. This solution was nearly saturated
with AlCl, before the first solvent extraction. ‘The subsequent
separation followed the first procedure. Neither product con-

tained detectable amounts of thorium.

(Reviewer's Note: - Irradiation of one gram of Th232 at

1013n/cm?- sec. for one day will produce 0.25 curie of Pa233))

Procedure 2
Preparation of carrler-free protactinium-233, according to
F. Hagemann, M, H. Studier, and A. Ghiorso,
U. S. Atomic Energy Comm. Report CF-3796 (1947),
as quoted by Hyde (&)

The bombarded Th metal was dissolved in concentrated HNO4,
using a small amount of F~ as a catalyst. The aqueous solu-
tion was salted with Ca(NO3), to give solutions of 2.5 M
Ca(NO;),, 1 If HNO;, and 0.42 Mf Th(NO;),. The bulk of the y233
was removed by ether extraction, following which Pa233 was iso-
lated by diisopropyl ketone extraction. Further purification
was obtained by three MnO, cycles in which 1 mg/ml of MnO, was
successively precipitated from HNO, solution and redissolved

in HNO5 in the presence of NaNO, . After the third cycle the

Procedure 2 (Continued)
solution was made 3.5 M Ca(NO3), and 1 M HNO, and was extracted

with ethyl ether again to effect complete removal of uranium,
The protactinium was again coprecipitated on MnOj, dissolved
in concentrated HCl, and diluted to an acidity of 0.05 M; the
protactinium was extracted into 2 0.15 M solution of thenoyl-

trifluoroacetone in benzene.

Procedure 3
Preparation of carrier-free protactinium=233, according to
W. W, Meinke, U, S. Atomic Energy Comm. Reports
AECD-2738 and AECD-2750 (1949) as quoted by Hyde (6)
The bombarded thorium-metal target is dissolved in concentrated
HNO;, using 0.01 M (8H, ) ,5iF¢ as a catalyst. The solution is
diluted to approximately 4 N HNO3 and a thorium concentration
less than 0.65 M. Then Ma’ in excess and KMnO, are added to
precipitate 1.5 mg/ml MnO, to carry the protactinium. The MnO,
is dissolved in a small amount of 4 M NHoO0H, The MnO, is
reprecipltated and redissolved three times to reduce the final
solution volume to a few milliliters. After it is made 6 M
HCl or HNO, , it is extracted with two to three volumes of diiso-
propyl ketone. The ketone phase is washed three times with 1 M
HNO; and 3 M NH,NO; wash solution. The protactinium is finally
stripped out into 0.1 M HNOy. The protactinium left behind is
recovered by useing fresh ketone to repeat the extraction cycle.
All 0.1 M HNOj re-extraction solutions are combined, made 6M
HNO3, and contacted with an equal volume of 0.4 M thenoyltri-

fluoroacetone (TTA) in benzene. The benzene solution of prot-

actinium-TTA complex is washed with 6 M HNOj once.

Procedure 4
Preparation of carrier-free protactinium-233, according to
Max. W. Hill (Thesis), U. S. Atomic Energy Comm. Report
UCRL-8423 (August, 1958)
The targets were either Th metal or ThCl; powder, some of

which was converted to ThO, during the bombardments.

Concentrated HC1-0.01 M HF was used for dissolving relatively
small amounts of powder. Thorium metal was dissolved in con-
centrated HCl - 0.2 M HF, The fluoride was complexed by the
addition of borax (Na,B,0;-10 H,0) or AlCl, before the solu-

tion was passed through the column.

The colurm was 3 mm. in diameter and was filled to a height
of 55 mm. with Dowex-1 anion-exchange resin. The colum
volume, defined as the number of drops required for a band to

traverse the length of the resin column, was 5-6 drops.

In 10 M HCl solutions, Pa(V), Zr(IV), and Nb(V) stick to the
resin, while Th(IV) passes through with the other alpha

emitters below Pa in the periodic table,

With 6 M HCl as the eluting agent, Zr(IV) is rapidly stripped
off in a few column volumes, without loss of Pa(V) or Nb(V).
The Pa is then eluted in 9.0 M HC1-0.1 M HF. The Nb(V) is

eluted in 1-4 M HCL.

The 9.0 M HCL - 0.1 M HF solution containing the Pa was con-
tacted with an equal volume of diisopropyl ketone (DIPK).
Under these conditions, such species as Fe(III) and Po(1V)

extract quantitatively into the DIPK along with appreciable

ho
Procedure 4 (Continued)

amounts of Sn(IV), Nb(V), and others. Protactinium(V) ex-

tracts to the extent of less than 0.4%.

The solvent phase was discarded, and borax or anhydrous AlCl,
was added to the aqueous phase. (Although AlCl4 seemed to have
- slightly better complexing characteristics, it appeared to be
appreciably soluble in DIPK, and excess quantities in solution

gave voluminous precipitates.)

The aqueous phase was then contacted with an equal volume of
fresh DIPK, Under these conditions, Pa(V) is extracted
quantitatively by the solvent phase, separating it from Th(IV),
Ti(Iv), Vv(V), Zr(IVv), U(VI), and other species. The Pa wae
then re-extracted from the solvent phase into an equal volume

of 2.0 M HCI.

To remove all extraneous mass and reduce the volume to a very
few drops, the solution containing the Pa was then made approxi-
mately 10 M in HCl and passed through a small anion resin
colum (3 mm. in diameter, 12 mm. in height). After being
washed with 10 M HCl, the Pa was eluted with 2.7 M HCl. The
third through sixth drops contained more than 90 per cent of

the protactinium.

Procedure 5

Determination of protactinium-233, according to
F. L. Moore and S. A. Reynolds
Anal. Chem. 29, 1956 (1957)
1. The sample drawn from the process should immediately

be adjusted to 6 M HCl or greater. Add an aliquot of suitable

counting rate to a separatory funnel or 50-ml. Lusteroid tube,
Adjust the aqueous phase to 6 M HCl-4% H2C04. (Lf the original
sample contains Th, omit the HyC,0, in the original aqueous
phase and perform the extraction from 6 M HCl. Wash the di-
isobutyl carbinol (DIBC) phase (see next step) for lL to 2
minutes with an equal volume of 6 M HCl before beginning the
three scrubs of 6 M HCl-4% H,C,0,).

2. Extract for 5 minutes with an equal volume of DIBC
(previously treated for 5 minutes with an equal volume of
6 M HCL). | |

3. After the phases have disengaged, draw off and
discard the aqueous phase. Scrub the organic phase for
5 minutes with an equal volume of wash solution (6 Y HCL ~-
4% HpoC20,). Repeat with two additional scrubs of

the organic phase. Draw the organic phase into a

50-ml, Lusteroid tube, centrifuge for 1 minute, and draw off
an aqueous phase which appears in the bottom of the tube,
being careful not to lose any of the organic phase. (In many
samples, an aliquot of the organic phase may be taken at this
stage for counting. Only if a substantial activity of Nb, Sb,
or free I, is present is it necessary to strip the organic
phase.)

4. Strip the organic phase by extracting for 3 minutes
with an equal volume of 6 M H,50

Centrifuge for 1 minute and draw off most of the organic phase,
being careful not to lose any of the aqueous phase. Centrifuge
for 1 minute.

5. Pipet suitable aliquots of the aqueous phase for
233

Pa counting. The expected yield is 97-98%.

* Oxallc acid omitted from original aqueous phase, values

(Reviewer's Comment: - The procedure is basically sound, but

the degree of separation is affected by the concentrations of
Pa and Nb, A DIBC solution containing 2.5 mg. Pa23l and 20
mg. Nb per ml. plus a stoichiometric amount of phosphate was
scrubbed with an equal volume of 6 M HC1-5% H,C,0,. The
aqueous phase contained 1.5% of the Pa and 75.3% of the Nb,

When the organic phase was scrubbed a second time with fresh

L3
Procedure 5 (Continued)

aqueous, the aqueous phase contained 92.1% of the residual

Nb and 2.3% of the Pa.

The presence of iron also interferes significantly, presumably

because of the formation of a strong oxalate complex. The

concentration of oxalic acid is probably less important than
the total amount relative to the amount of niobium and other

oxalate-complexing cations.)

Procedure 6
Determination of protactinium in uranium residues,
according to J. Golden and A. G. Maddock,
J. Inorg. Nucl. Chem. 2, 48-59 (1956)

The siliceous material consisted mainly of the sulfates of

Pb, Ba, and Ca.

Two methods of opening up were used. In the first, one-gram
samples were treated with 10 ml. of 60% oleum, and a known
amount of Pa233 added to the mixture. The Pb, Ba, and Ca
sulfates were dissolved, and the siliceous residue, containing

the Pa, was separated and dissclved in 5 ml, of 40% HF,

Alternatively, it was found that the original material could
be attacked with 40% HF containing the pa233 tracer, leaving

the heavy-metal sulfates as residue and dissolving both pa?3l

and pa233, (Reviewer's Comment: - It is highly questionable

that isotopic exchange was complete.)

Either solution was diluted to 100 ml., and an excess of

BaCl, was added. The BaF, precipitate was washed until no

bh
Procedure 6 (Continued)

obvious decrease in bulk took place. The remaining precipitate

consisted presumably of fluosilicates and was dissolved in
LM AL(NO5) 3-6 N HNO, The Pa was then carried down on a
MnO, precipitate, sufficient MnCl, and MnO, solutions being
added to produce about 10 mg. of precipitate per ml. of
original solution. The mixture was digested at 100°C. for

half an hour.

The resulting precipitate was separated, washed, and dissolved
in 20 ml. of 7 N HCl with a trace of NaNO, . Alternatively,
the precipitate was leached with 10 ml. of 1 N HF,

In some analyses, the MnO, stage was omitted entirely, and

the fluosilicate precipitate was dissolved in 7 N HCl-1 M

AlCl3. The HCl solution from either of these three variations

was extracted with an equal volume of diisopropyl ketone.

Separation from most of the polonium can be effected by re-

extraction from the solvent into 7-8 N HCl - 0.5 N HF."

Procedure 7
Determination of preotactinium in uranyl solution,
according to J. Golden and A. G. Maddock,
J. Inorg. Nucl. Chem. 2, 46-59 (1956)
The solution was made 8 N in HCl and 0.5 N in HF and the

tracer protactinium~233 added.

Direct extraction with diisopropyl ketone removed many impuri-
ties, e.g., iron and polonium. Extraction after adding AlCl,

to complex the fluoride present brought the protactinium into

5
Procedure 7 (Continued)
the solvent layer. Washing this layer with 8 N HCl removed
those elements whose extraction had been enhanced by the

presence of AlCl, e.g., uranium and zirconium.

Finally, the protactinium was back-extracted with 6-8 N HCL -

0.5 N HF,

The next solvent cycle avoided the use of AlCl,, repeated
NH,OH precipitation and HCl solution, or continued evaporation

with HCl, being used to remove fluoride.

ln either case, the efficiency of a cycle was 98% or more,
without repetition of any step. At the most two of these

cycles were found to be sufficient to achleve radiochemical

purity.

Procedure 8
Determination of protactinium by gamma spectrometry,
according to M. L. Salutsky, M., L, Curtis, K. Shaver,
A, Elmlinger, and R, A. Miller,
Anal, Chem. 29, 373 (1957)
1. Weigh about 5 g. of uranium residue into a vial
suitable for counting in a well-type gamma scintillation

spectrometer. Determine the counting rate at 300 kev.

2. Transfer the sample to a beaker with a small amount
of 1,0, add 100 ml, of 9 N HCl and 1-2 ml. of 48% HF. Heat
until the sample dissolves. Add more HF, if necessary.

3. Cool to room temperature. Add slowly, with stirring,

10 ml. 1 N HCl containing 10 mg, Th. Allow the mixture to

h6
Procedure 8 (Continued)

stand 5 minutes. Add a second 10 mg. of Th, stir, and allow
the mixture to stand 5 minutes. Filter the ThFy.

4, Transfer the filter paper and precipitate to the vial
used for the orlginal sample. Determine the gamma counting
rate at 300 kev. Make a blank determination for the activity
of the Th carrier used.

5. Obtain the Pa gamma counting rate by difference.
Compare this counting rate wlth that of a standard protactinium
sample at 300 kev, and calculate the concentration of Pa in the

uranium residue.

(Reviewer's Comment: - This procedure contains a number of

fundamental errors, but, with appropriate modifications, may
be useful for obtaining a rough estimate of the Pa concentra-

tion in certain types of samples.

The basic assumption of this procedure is that, under the
conditions given, all of the protactinium will remain in
solution, while all other radioisotopes which contribute to
the 300 kev gamma-counting rate will be carried on ThF,.

The first part of this assumption is subject to considerable
doubt; Moore and Reynolds (cited in Procedure 1) found wide
variations in the behavior of protactinium in the presence of
fluoride precipitates. The second part of the assumption
ignores the substantial contribution of radium-223 and other
radium isotopes to the 300 kev counting rate. It 1s unlikely
that a large percentage of the radium would be carrled on ThF,

under the conditlons recommended.

47
Procedure 8 (Continued)

Finally, no correction was made for the contribution to the

300 kev gamma-counting rate by decay products in the "standard

‘gample”,

The following modifications seem indicated:

1. Determine the yield by adding protactinium-233 to
a separate sample at Step 2. (The yield determination must
be made separately because of the 310 kev gamma ray of
protactinium-233.)

2. Add barium carrier after Step 4, and precipltate
barium chloride by the addition of diethyl ether. (Moore
and Reynolds found that both BaCl, and BaSQO, carried sub-
stantial amounts of protactinium-233 in the absence of fluoride,
but did not test them in fluoride solutions. The yield
correction allows for the possibility that some protactinium
is carried by the barium precipitate.)

3. Correct the gamma-count rate of the standard sample
for growth of decay products, or prepare a fresh standard

sample free of decay products (See Procedure 9). )

Procedure 9

Determination of protactinium by differential gamma spectrometry,
according to H. W. Kirby and P., E. Figgins, Unpublished.

(Reviewer's Note: - This procedure is limited to analysis of
samples contalning only protactinium-231 and the actinium-227

chain.)
1.

Procedure 9 (Continued)

Obtain a sample of actinium-227 in equilibrium with

its decay products (AEM). The actinium should preferably have

been prepared by neutron irradiation of radium-226 to avoid

possible Pa23l contamination.

2.

Prepare a radiochemically pure Pa23l standard by

one of two methods.

a.

If the protactinium is in a dry state, dissolve
it in hot concentrated H,80, and dilute the

solution to 18 N H,50,. Add an equal volume of
12 N HCl to the cooled solution and one or two

drops of 30% Hy0,. (If the protactinium is in
aqueous solution, adjust the concentration to

9 N HySO, - 6 N HCL. Fluoride must be absent or
complexed with atl or H;BO,. It may also be
removed by evaporation to fumes with H,S0,.)
Extract the aqueous solution with 2 ml. of
diisobutyl carbinol (DIBC) diluted to 50% with
benzene, Amsco kerosene, or other inert diluent.
Scrub the organic phase with fresh 9 N H,S0,-

6 N HCl. The organic phase will contain radio-

chemically pure Pa23l,

"If the Pa23l ig in DIBC or other organic solution,

scrub the organic solution with two or three
volumes of 9 N H,80, - 6 N HCL to remove decay
products. The Pa should be repurified at least

once a week,

L9
Procedure 9 (Continued)

3. Determine the location of the peaks of the unknown
sample in the regions of 90 and 300 kev. Count the AEM, the
unknown, and standard Pa in that order at the peak of the
unknown in the 90 kev ‘region. Repeat the procedure in the
300 kev region. (Background in each region should be de-
termined before and after each series of three counts, and
weighted if there is significant variation with time.)

4, Calculate the ratio of the 90 kev count to the 300
kev count in each sample.

6. Determine the alpha counting rates of the Pa and
AEM standard samples elther by transferring them to alpha-
counting plates or by counting aliquots of the same solutions.

6. By simultaneous equations, calculate the contribu-
tion of protactinium and of AEM to the gamma-counting rate
of the unknown at its peak in the 300 kev region. Correlate

these gamma counts of AEM and protactinium.

actinium-227 chain (thorium-227, radium-223) has been
recently broken. Both the AEM standard and the Pa unknown

should be at least six months old.

‘The procedure needs to be evaluated with synthetic mixtures
of Pa and AEM, but it appears to work well with samples of
‘known age, in which the decay product growth can be

calculated.)

Procedure 10

Determination of protactinium in uranium residues,
according to H. W. Kirby (Unpublished)

1. To five grams of the residue in'a 50-ml. centrifuge
tube add 25 ml. of 12 N HCl, mix thoroughly, and warm gently
until the initial evolution of gas subsides. Bring the
temperature of the water bath to 85-90°C, and heat the mixture
in the bath for one hour, stirring occasionally. |

2. Without waiting for the mixture to cool, centrifuge
and decant to a second centrifuge tube.

4. Transfer the residue as a -plurry in 10 ml. H,0 to a
test tube of a size suitable for use In a well-type gamma
scintillation spectrometer; Centrifuge the residue to the
bottom of the test tube and pour or draw off the supernate.

To the residue add 10 ml. of a saturated solution of the
tetrasodium calc of ethylene dlamine tetraacetic acid (2a EDTA)
adjusted to oH 12. Digest the ‘mixture on the hot water bath
for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Cool, centrifuge, and

a 27 kev peak exists, but it 1s obacured by excessive gamma
"radiation in. the 90 kev region, repeat the digestion with the’

Procedure 10 (Continued)

Step 2. Treat the residue as in Steps 3 and 4. Retain the
organic extracts and discard the aqueous phase and the
residue. (We have not found it necessary to go beyond this

- point to recover protactinium from the HCl insoluble residue.)

(1f the residue should prove more refractory than those vith
which we have had experience, a repetition of Step 5 is |

. recommended. If that should fail, the use of HCl would be
considered.)

6. To the HCl solution in the second centrifuge tube
(Step 2), add 10 mg. Ti as TiCly and mix thoroughly. Add
0.5 ml, of 85% HaPO, and two or three drops of concentrated
HNO5. Mix and heat on the water bath at 85-90°C for one
hour, stirring occasionally. Cool, centrifuge and decant the
supernate to a third centrifuge tube. |

7. Treat the precipitate as in Step 3. (The Ti preci-
pitate usually dissolves completely after the addition of |
HCl and H,0,. However, any insoluble residue may be treated
as in Steps 4 and 5, if necessary.)

8. To the HCl solution in the third centrifuge tube
(Step 6), add 10 mg. Ti, two or three drops of concentrated
HNO5, and enough 12 N HCl to restore the volume to 30-35 ml.

Treat this solution as in Steps 6 and 7.

9. Combine all the organic extracts in a single 50-ml,

Procedure 11
Preparation of tetravalemt protactinium, according to
M. Halssinsky and G. Bouissiéres, Bull. Soc. Chim. France
1931, 146-8, No. 37. (From the translation
by Mae Sitney, AEC-tr-1878)
Al-3R H,80, or HCl solution of pure protactinium or prot-
actinium mixed with its carriers is placed in contact with

solid gin¢ amalgam in a plexiglas column.

The column is joined to a Buchner funnel, also of plexiglas.
The latter 1s closed at the bottom by clamped rubber tubing,

80 that the liquid does not run out through the filter paper.

Hydrogen ges 1s constantly circulated through .the various
parts of the apparatus, and at the same time, the solution
of protactinium is run through the Buchner. It slowly forms
a precipitate consisting either of the fluoride salt of
reduced protactinium or of a mixture with LaF, 1f a lanthanum

salt 1s used as a carrier.

‘When the precipitate is collected, it is separated rapidly

by filtration, accomplished by increasing the pressure of

4
Procedure 11 (Continued)
hydrogen and opening the clamp on the Buchner. Eventually,

it can be washed with Hyo0 which is passed over the amalgam.

"The reduction can also be carried out in the Buchner, in
‘which the amalgam is placed in contact with the HF solution
of protactinium. The precipitation of the fluoride produced
in this case is proportional to the reduction. The procedure
may be advantageous for separating protactinium from tantalum,
zirconium and titanium, which can be dissolved much more

easily in HF than in other mineral acids.

If the precipitate (of PaF,) is collected on filter paper, it
can be stored for 12 to 15 hours without being completely

reoxldized.

Procedure 12
Preparation of solutions of protactinium(V) in alkali
according to Z. Jakovac and M. Lederer,
J. Chromatography 2, 411-17 (1959) -
 Protactinium-233 tracer in- 6 N HCl was evaporated in a micro-
beaker, a few pellets of NaOH or KOH were added and fused
. over a naked flame for a few minutes, cooled and diluted with
H,0 to yield a solution 5N with respect to alkali. Such

solutione usually contain a soluble fraction but also an in-

goluble activity.

If the sclution in HCl ig taken to dryness and moistened with
concentrated HCl and again evaporated, and this process

- repeated three times, the insoluble compound does not form.

55
Procedure 12 (Continued)

It seems that during evaporation with 6 N HCl some radio-=
colloid is formed which does not react readily with NaOH,

When evaporated repeatedly wish concentrated HCl this seems
to he inhibited and prestmably the protactinium(V) is left

in the beaker as a very thin layer on ‘the surface, which then

reacts readily with fused NaOH.

When solutione which have been evaporated three times with
concentrated HCl are treated wlth aqueous 6 N KOH, some
transformation into a soluble form was also noted. Without

this pretreatment no soluble fraction is obtained.

Procedure 13

Preparation of solutions of protactinium in nitric acid,
according to C.J Hardy, D. Scargill, and J. M. Fletcher,
J. Inorg. Nucl. Chem. Z, 257~ 75 (1958)

Milligram amounts of protactinium-231 were available in a
-HC1-HF solution at a concentration of 0.3 mg./ml. Stock solu-
tions (of the order of 10-3 to 10% i Pa in 6 N HNO3) were )
prepared from this by evaporating almost to dryness with HNO,
several times; followed by three precipitations by NH, OH, to
assist in the decontamination from fluoride, with re-solution

each time in cold 6 M HNO.

It was found necessary to dissolve the hydroxide precipitate
shortly (<5 minutes) after its formation to. prevent aging to-

HNOg=insoluble compounds of protactinium.

%
. Procedure 13 (Continued)
The solutions so prepared always contained small amount of
alpha activity (approximately five per cent of the total)
inextractable by eributyl phosphate. Prolonged centrifuging
and heating to 100°C, in sealed tubes reduced the alpha-active
inextractable material to one per cent; this was due to

. daughters of protactinium-231.

Aqueous stock solutions were obtained free from inextractable
alpha activity by a preliminary solvent extraction cycle,

e.g., by extraction from 10 M HNO, for two minutes with 50

3
per cent tributyl phosphate, stripping with. 2 M HNOj, and

scrubbing with benzene to remove traces of tributyl phosphate.

Procedure 14.

Separation of protactinium and niobium
according to F, L. Moore,
Anal. Chem. 27, 70-72 (1955)

Polyethylene bottles were used in all the extractions. The
original aqueous phases contained 1 mg./ml. of Nb carrier
(dissolved in 0.18 M H,C,0,) and a total radioactivity of

1.46 x 106 gamma counts per minute or Nb?

4

‘radioactivity of
5.4 x 10° gemma counts per minute, Separate extractions were
done under the same conditions for Pa233 tracer and Nb%>

tracer.

Three-minute extractions were performed with equal volumes
(9 ml.) of diisobutylcarbinol that had been pretreated for

three minutes with HF of the same concentration as the

original aqueous phase. The organic phases were separated,
centrifuged, and washed for one minute with an equal volume
of a solution of the same HF-H,50, concentration as the

original aqueous phase.

J. Chromatography 1, 52-61 (1958)

Polyethylene was used throughout. Chromatograms were developed
by ascending elution. Separations were carried out. in a
cylinder which was 17 cm. in diameter and 27 cm. high. Sheets
of Whatman No. 1 chromatographic paper (22 x 22 cm.) were
rolled into cylinders and placed in the bottom of the reservoir.
Solutions were deposited on the paper with the aid of a poly-~

ethylene micropipet. Chromatograms were developed over a

basically the same as that used for all other actinides (See

Procedure 17).

In this reviewer's opinion, urinalysis for protactinium is
an exercise in futility. Ingested protactinium is far more

likely to be found in the feces.)

VIL. APPENDIX

Summary of the Protactinium Project at Mound Laboratory

The production of approximately one gram of protactinium-231

at Mound Laboratory is dwarfed in significance by the fact,

65
noted elsewhere in this report, that approximately 100 grams

“of this nuclide ‘was recently isolated in Great Britain,

Nevertheless, it seems worthwhile to describe the operation at
this Laboratory for its historical value as well as for the
additional chemical insight afforded by the various steps in
the process. It 1s especially noteworthy that at no point in
the process was it found necessary, or even desirable, to use

fluoride for the solubilization of the protactinium.

The protactinium project vas initiated in 1954 at the request
of Oak Ridge National Laboratory for the purpose of obtaining
a supply of protactinium which could be used to study its )
macrochemical properties.

The best available source was a tesidue which could be filtered
‘from the aqueous raffinate resulting from the diethyl ether
extraction of uranium, . The residue, whose major constituents
were iron, aluminum, calcium, magnesium, cobalt, and copper,
‘contained approximately 0.1 to 0.2 ppm of protactinium. A
process was developed and réeported®® which gave good recoveries
and purity on a microgram scale, The process consisted of
dissolution in 1 N HCl, saturation with NaCl, and boiling to
coagulate a small precipitate, which consisted principally of
calcium and silica, and which carried protactinium quantita-
tively. The precipitate was digested with NaOH, to remove
silica, and the hydroxide residue was dissolved in 9 N HCL.

The solution was passed through an anion exchanger, leaving
protactinlum on the resin. The protactinium was eluted with

a mixture of HCl and HF.
On the basis of the apparently simple and inexpensive process,

~ 20 tons of raw material was obtained from the uranium refinery
Inasmuch as the filtration of the precipitate from the aqueous
waste stream was not a normal part of the treatment of the.
aqueous waste, no stockpile was available, and the raw material

was obtained from the then-current refinery operations.

When received at this Laboratory (in 80 steel drums) it was
obviously inhomogeneous; the color of the material ranged

from a light tan to the dark reddish-brown of ferric hydroxide.
Spectrographic analysis confirmed that the material was sig-
nificantly different in composition from the samples previously
received for analysis and process development. Typically,

iron was a major constituent, and the aluminum and calcium
previously found were either absent or reduced to minor con-
stituents. No two drums contained raw material of identical

composition.

A single drum was selected which appeared to be intermediate
in composition, and optimum conditions for the dissolution and
precipitation of the protactinium were developed®l. Plant

operations were then begun.

The material in the selected drum behaved exactly as predicted,
as did one or two other batches. However, the inhomogeneity
of the raw material quickly became evident when the protac-
tinium either failed to dissolve quantitatively in the
selected acid (2 N HCl) or; after dissolving, failed to pre-

cipitate when NaCl was added and the solution boiled.

67
Since of the 20 tons of raw material available, only about
half would be needed to fulfill the commitment for one gram

of protactinium, batches were selected on the basis of the
solubility of protactinium in 2 N HCl, Simultaneous analyti-
cal and process development (See Procedure 10) showed that

the precipitate which carried protactinium from the NaCl
solutlon was not, as previously thought, a calcium silicate,
but Ti0,+xPOz, and that the coprecipitation could be made
quantitative by addition of TiClj to the HCl solution.

(The raw material contained sufficient nitrate ion to oxidize
the Ti*3, Precipitation of Ti*3 is incomplete and excessively
slow in the presence of ferric ion.) Therefore, failure of
the protactinium to coprecipitate quantitatively was corrected
by the expedient of adding TiClj to the process solution.

(It was subsequently found that those batches in which prot-
actinium failed to dissolve easlly were phosphate-deficient
and probably required much higher acidities to solubilize the
iron. In addition, the protactinium was probably held in an

insoluble condition by the more refractory TiO; and Nb,0s.)

The NaOH metathesis of the protactiniferous precipitate, which
was called for by the original process, produced a residue |
which was only partially soluble in 9 N HCl, and the protac-
tinium which did dissolve hydrolyzed slowly and reprecipitated.
It was, therefore, not suitable for use as an anion exchange
feed solution. Digsolution in HF and separation of the iron
on an anion exchanger3? was found to be impractical because of

the excessively large quantities of irom which had to be removed.

68
However, a slurry of the hydroxide residue in 6 N HCl could
be extracted with diisobutyl carbinol (DIBC) diluted to 50
per cent with Amsco kerosene. If the dissolution and extrac-
tion were carried out shortly after the NaOH treatment, about
80 per cent of the protactinium could be extracted before
hydrolysis produced "inextractable" protactinium. It is note=-
worthy that the presence of large amounts of iron decreases

the rate of hydrolysis of protactinium in HCl.

After extraction by DIBC, the aqueous raffinate was allowed
to settle, and the supernate was discarded. The insoluble
residue was retained for further processing with H,50,-HC1

(Procedure 10, Step 3).

The organic phase was stripped with two successive portions

of one-tenth its volume of water.

Although considerable iron was separated by the coprecipita-
tion of protactinium on Tl from HCl solution, the iron which
remained was extracted by DIBC and stripped along with the
protactinium. When attempts were made to concentrate the
protactinlum by recycling through DIBC, it was found that, in
high concentration, iron was extracted preferentially and
limited the degree of protactinium concentration which could

be achieved.

The strip solution was made 5-6 N in HCl and extracted with
isopropyl ether, which removed a large, but undetermined,

percentage of the iron with a loss of only about one per cent

€9
of the protactinium. Higher HCl concentrations drove more
iron into the organic phase, but the loss of protactinium
became prohibitive. The aqueous phase was adjusted with H,80,

and HCl, and the protactinium was extracted in p1Bch2,

The organic phase was stripped with one-tenth its volume of
30% Hy0,. The strip solution was adjusted to 9 N H,80, -

6 N HCl, and the protactinium was re-extracted in DIBC. After
four cycles of extraction and stripping, approximately one
gram of protactinium was concentrated in fractions totaling

less than one gallon of aqueous and organic solutions.

The work was interrupted at this point and was not resumed
for more than a year. By that time, all of the protactinium
had hydrolyzed, affording further separation from iron. Dis-
golution in H,80, and extraction in DIBC yielded 660 ml. of
organic solution containing approximately 900 milligrams of
protactinium. A spectrographic analysis of the first concen-

trate is glven in Table IV¥*,

It was apparent that the principal impurities were irom,
phosphate; and nlobium. The presence of bismuth was highly
questlonable, and no specific effort was made to separate

it or any of the other reported impurities. Analysis of the

final product confirmed the validity of the decision.

Development of purification methods proceeded concurrently

with the purification itself, so that, by the time a method

had been developed which could be used routinely, nearly the

entire batch had been partially purified.

Tl

It was found that
methods which were effective at one level of purity were
either partially or totally ineffective at the next higher
level, so that no one method was ever developed which could,
with complete confidence, be used at all stages of the

purification.

For example, in a typical series of experiments, 25 ml. of
DIBC containing Fe, Nb, and about 35 mg. of Pa was stripped
with an aqueous solution which was 4 N HCl and 10% Hy0,.

The volume ratio of the phases was varied, and the course of
the iron separation was followed with the aid of Fe’? added
as a tracer. The percentage of Pa stripped rose sharply with
increasing aqueous volume and reached a plateau of 98% at an
aqueous-organic ratio of about 0.15, The amount of Fe stripped
also increased, but less sharply, so that, at a volume ratio
of 0.14, 95.6% of the Pa was stripped with 2.0% of the Fe.
However, when the organic phase was stripped a second time
with fresh strip solution in the same ratio, the aqueous

phase contained almost 20% of the Fe.

It is evident that, in solutions of relatively high concentra-
tions, the degree of separation by solvent extraction is
governed by the relative solubilities of the metal ion com=
plexes in the aqueous and organic solutionms, rather than by
their individual distribution coefficients. This contrasts

with their behavior in more nearly ideal solutions.

The HC1-H,0, strip gave no separation from Nb. However, after

addition of H,50, to the strip solution, the Pa was re-

T2
extracted with DIBC, and approximately half of the Nb remained

in the aqueous phase with less than 6% of the Pa.

Spectrographic analysis showed that 75% of the phosphorus had
been removed. The intermediate product consisted of 835 mg.
of protactinium in 150 ml. of DIBC. The iron-laden organic
and the niobium-laden aqueous raffinates were retained, and

the protactinium was subsequently recovered and purified.

A second, and far more effective, Fe separation was discovered
at a later stage in the purification: When 10 ml. of DIBC
containing Pa, Fe, and Nb was stripped with a mixture of 4.5
ml. of 18 N H,80, and 0.5 ml. of 30% H,0,, the organic phase
retained 62% of the Nb and 100% of the Fe, while 100% of the
Pa passed into the aqueous phase. The Pa was reextracted

into DIBC after addition of HCl to the aqueous phase.

Attempts to separate Nb from Pa by stripping the organic solu-
tion with an HG1/HyC90y mixture? were unsuccessful so long

as both elements were present in relatively high concentrations.
With the bulk of the Nb removed, the efficlency of separation
was improved, but was still not completely satisfactory: In

a single pass with equal volumes. of organic and aqueous phases,
a mixture of 5% HoC,0, and 6 N HCl stripped out about 70% of
the Nb and about 5% of the Pa. When Fe(III) was present to a
significant degree, the H,C,0,/HCL strip was almost totally

ineffective.

A batch countercurrent method was developed which stripped

the Nb from each batch of organic solution with three separate

73
portions of the HpCy04/HCL mixture. About 95% of the Nb was

removed in the aqueous phases, with about 5% of the Pa.

The aqueous phase was diluted with an equal volume of H,y0

and heated for 10 minutes at 90°C. Protactinium precipitated,
leaving Nb and Fe quantitatively in the supernatant solution
(cf. Ref. 23). The precipitate was centrifuged, and the Pa

was redissolved in H,SO, and extracted with DIBC.

Another separation of Nb from Pa, based on the hydrolytic
precipitation of Pa from acid oxalate solution, consisted of
stripping the DIBC solution with 10% H,C,0, which was 1 N in
HCl, A precipitate immediately appeared in the aqueous phase,
and was found to contain all of the Pa and 20% of the Nb.

The precipitate, on being heated with fresh strip solution,
dissolved almost completely, but a new precipitate formed in
a few minutes. The new precipitate contained all of the Pa,
while Nb remained quantitatively in solution. The precipita-
tion of Pa was somewhat erratic under these conditions, but
could be made quantitative by the addition of one drop of 857%

HaPO,, to 10 ml. of the oxalate solution.

Elimination of phosphate ion was achleved by precipitation

of protactinium iodate from dilute H,50,. The Pa was stripped
from DIBC with 5 N HpS50,, and the solution was diluted with
H,0. The solution, containing 120 mg. of Pa in 35 ml. of 1.4
N HoSOy, was warmed on a water bath. Protactinium lodate was
precipitated by the dropwise addition of 15% HIO3. The pre-

cipitate was cooled, centrifuged, and separated from the

Th
supernatant solution. The solution was gamma-counted and
contained the equivalent of between 0.1 and 0.5 mg. of Pa.
However, gamma-ray spectrometry showed that the gamma activity
came almost entirely from actinium~227 and its decay products;
the 27-kev gamma peak of protactinium-231 was completely

absent.

The protactinium iodate was digested with concentrated HCl
and warmed gently until gas evolution ceased. The Pa dis-
solved initially, but reappeared shortly as a flocculent
precipitate, which was centrifuged, washed, and dried at 110°C.
A spectrographic analysis of the hydrous oxide is given in

Table IV,

Approximately 0.5 g. of Pa was ignited to the pentoxide at
675°C, An x-ray powder pattern showed that the crystal struc-
ture corresponded to that of cublc Pa,05' 2%,
