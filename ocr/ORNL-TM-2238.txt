USING A SLIT SCANNING TECHNIQUE
R. L. Macklin, J. H. Gibbons, and T. H. Handley

ABSTRACT

Protons from the ORNL 3 MV Van de Graaff accelerator
were brought to a line focus and collimated thru slits of
either 0.025 or 0.0075 cm. Cross sectional cuts of graphite
samples were moved across the beam to study the distribution
of Li and F with depth by measuring the yields of neutrons
and of gamma rays from the reactions TLi(p,n) and 19F(p,oy).
A graphite sample exposed to molten fluorides in a loop
experiment at the Oak Ridge Research Reactor showed about 20
and 100 ppm (by weight) Li and F respectively, 2 mm below the
exposed surface. The observed ratio of Li to F was close to
that characteristic of the molten salt down to 3 mm below
the exposed surface.

INTRODUCTION

The proton induced reactions Ti (p,n) and Lp(p, oy) have been
used to measure the concentration of the target nuclides in graphite.’
This can be done in the presence of considerable radioactivity from
fission products, making the method attractive for studies of penetra-
tion in graphite moderated molten salt reactors.” In the previous work?
the exposed surface of a sample was ground away a layer at a time and
the concentrations near each freshly exposed surface measured with a
0.32 cm diameter, 0.1-1 microampere proton beam. This process required
special handling for the radioactive material ground off and introduced

considerable delay in the measurements.
METHOD AND APPARATUS

The ORNL 3 MV Van de Graaff accelerator proton beam is normally
focussed to a ~ 1 mm diameter spot at the target with a magnetic
guadrupole strong focus lens. By deliberately detuning this lens the
beam can be brought to a horizontal (or vertical) line focus about 1.0
x 0.08 cm. By using several microamperes of current and a metal slit,
sufficient beam could be passed through to a sample to perform the
analysis over an area 0.0075 cm x 0.60 cm, or with better sensitivity
(compared with background from F impurities in the slit collimator
material) 0.025 cm x 0.60 cm. With this arrangement, a sample exposed
in a reactor can be sectioned, cutting perpendicular to an exposed face

Tra and 1p with depth studied by simply moving

and the distribution of
the sample across the proton beam. The apparatus we used for this is
indicated schematically in Fig. 1. The graphite sample was mounted on
a micrometer head and moved in to intercept the beam. The proton beam
passing the sample induced a blue fluorescence in the quartz viewing
plate at the left so the point at which the edge of the sample just
intercepted all of the protons could be easily noted. The profile of
the beam passing through the slit was measured with a 0.005 cm Al foil
glued to the end of the graphite blank. Figures 2 and 3 show the
2TA1(p,v) yield from this foil using 0.025 cm and 0.0075 cm gold slits
respectively. Slits of tantalum showed too much contamination with
fluorine. The slight asymmetry of the scans is probably due to a few

protons striking the exposed face of the Al foil rather than the edge

as the blank sample was pulled up out of the beam.
- 3 -

Gamma rays were detected by a 12.5 cm dia. x 17.5 cm long NaI(T1)
crystal through a 1.25 cm lead filter at the side of the sample housing.
Neutrons were detected in the straight ahead position as in reference (1).
As the graphite blank sample could readily be brought into the beam to
check the background without dismounting the sample, we used 2.06 MeV
protons (just below the Be (p,n) threshold) throughout, rather than
dropping the energy below the TLi(p,n) threshold (1.88 MeV) to check

background.

STANDARDS
Pressed samples of graphite powder containing weighed quantities

7

of 'LiF were used as standards.

SAMPLE
The sample studied was taken from a molten salt convection loop
exposed in the Osk Ridge Research Reactor (ORR) last year.> The piece
available for study is shown in Fig. 4 (ORNL Slide No. T4245). The
straightest side shown is the wall of a molten salt exit channel
sectioned axially after exposure. The proton beam was centered along
this surface, as nearly parallel to it as its irregularities would

9

permit. The reactor exposure history of the sample included over 10%

235

fast neutrons per square centimeter (79% of it with U bearing molten

salt) and a cracked outlet pipe with consequent air contamination.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The homogeneity of the standards was disappointing. Scans of
original and freshly cut surfaces showed considerable variability. The

standard deviation at a single proton beam position appeared to be about
- 4 =

35%. An uncertainty of that size is indicated for the absolute scales
of concentration. The standardization was, however, based on the grand
average of all our measurements on the 200 ppm (T1iF by weight) stan-
dard. Until more uniform standards are available or the cause of the
observed nonuniformity is better understood, we hesitate to claim
greater accuracy for the concentration scale.

The fluorine and lithium concentrations in the sample as a
function of distance from the flow channel surface are shown in Figs.
5 and 6. The rapid decrease in concentration in the first ten mils or
so (0.025 cm) is expected. The persistence of moderate concentrations
to much greater depths is puzzling. Figure 7 shows the ratio of F to
Li concentration. The ratio is persistently near the ratio characteristic
of the molten salt mixture rather than that for the LiF molecule or the
progressively lower values expected for free ionic diffusion. It has
been suggested’ that the bulk of the material seen at depth may repre-
sent liquid phase intrusion via a slant crack. It should be noted that
the promotion of graphite wetting by the air contamination experienced
in the ORR Loop should make smaller cracks than usual effective in this

regard.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION OF SAMPLE
The graphite sample was viewed (x 10 and x 20 magnification)
with a binocular microscope. The surface is relatively quite rough,
with saw markings a few thousandths of an inch deep and pock-marked with
many voids several thousandths of an inch in diameter. There is evidence
of at least one long groove or crack in the sample at about 20°

inclination to the exposed surface. The surface is also irregularly
- 5a

discolored, reminiscent of differential heating effects. When wetted
with acetone numerous bubbles rose to the surface, clearly implying
penetration of the liquid into sub-surface voids. In short, this sample
shows gross irregularities and imperfections compared to the sample

taken from the MSRE that we studied earlier.t

FIGURE CAPTIONS
Schematic side view of the scanning system. The graphite sample
(from a specimen exposed to molten salts containing [6% and
19m) is cut so that the exposed surface is uppermost in the
figure. The "Li (p,n) and 198 (p, ory) yields indicate concentration
as a function of depth as the sample is moved up across the
collimated proton beam.
Proton beam profile using the .025 cm slit-collimator as
measured by the 2Ta1(p,v) reaction yield from g .005 cm Al foil
seen edge-on. The small random deviation of the points from
the curve is largely an indication of mechanical precision
and reproducibility in the experiment (about 0.0003 cm).
Proton beam profile for the .0075 cm slit-collimator measured
using the .005 cm Al foil. At the left the beam is hitting
clean graphite, whereas at the right it can graze tangentially
the flat face of the Al foil (see Fig. 1) producing a slight
tail in the composite resolution function shown.
Location and orientation of the sample cut from the 1967 ORR
Loop Specimen. The molten salt flow was largely upwards
through the drilled holes and channels shown in the photograph.
Fluorine concentration as a function of depth in the ORR Loop
graphite sample. The data taken at two slit widths are self-
consistent. The results cannot be accounted for by simple
ionic diffusion and may reflect non-homogeneous structure of
the graphite.
Lithium concentration as a function of depth in the ORR Loop

graphite sample. The data obtained with the two slit-collimators
8 -

are self-consistent. The lithium concentration beyond 100 mils
depth decreases more rapidly than expected.

Fig. 7 - Mass concentration ratio, F/Li, versus depth. The closeness of
the ratio observed to that typical of the bulk salt suggests
that most of the material found (at depths down to 30 mils)

may represent a liquid intrusion.
