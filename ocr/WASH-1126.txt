PREFACE

The widespread and concentrated efforts being devoted on a national
and {ntermational basis to develop a breeder reactor clearly evidences
man's intense desire to free himself from limited and costly energy
sources. The introduction of the breeder reactor into the utility
market will provide virtually unlimited energy which can be used to
elevate the standard of ving and, with proper attention, improve

man's enviroment,

The basic importance of major sustained commitments of managerial and
financial resources dy Governpent, private irdustry and the utilities
to the overall success of the ‘breeder program cannot be over-emphasired.
Experience in the development and application of civilian nuclear power
reactors has established that such commitments are essential to bring
into being the technologies, fesearch and development facilities,
trained personnel, components, systems, and production facilities
necessary to assure the succesatul introduction of the dreeder into

the comsercial market. In view of the substantial investment of the
nation's resources that the development of the breeder entails, it
seems highly appropriate that in making the dscision to proceed with
this program, estimated costs’ ‘be measured against the benefits expected

to derive from the investment.

In recognition of the desirability of better defining the commitments
and benefits implicit in the breeder development program, the 1. S.

Atomic Energy Commission, Division of Reactor Development and Technology

141
 

undertook the task of conducting the study described in this “Cost-
Benefit Analysis of the U. 8. Breeder Reactor Program,” The optinmi-
zation of the U. 8. electric SNeTEY economy Over a 50-year period
serves as a basis for the study. A linesr programming model of the
United States electrical energy economy developed dy Pacific North
vest Laboratory, and principal members of other sectors of the nuclear
community was used in the analysis, It 1s {sportant to note that the
model utilized in this analysts 1s in an early stage of development

and is being continually improved to better simulate the characteristics
of the nation's power economy.

The benefits considered in the calculations are those that are clearly
quantifiable and take the form of lowcost electrical energy, reductions
in uranium ore requirements and in separative work demand, increase in
plutonium production, and use of uranium tailings. Also, the report
makes reference to other benefits of major impowtance which are not
quantifiable, at least not at the present time. Such benefits include
those associated with reductions of air pollution and with new uses for
low cost electricity and heat such as large scale desalting of sea water.
Weighed against the quantifiable benefits are the costs expected to de
incurred dy the Government in the development of the breeder. This
approach appears reasonable in view of the fact that the coatinuing
program of systems analysts, which provides input for studies of this
nature, has as its major objective the determination of the GCovernmeat's

future role in advanced reactor development.

The funds and other resources which the Government, the large industrial
complex, end the utilities Have already comisted to the breeder program
and to companion poa-breeder programs coupled to the uranium-plutonium
cycle, have not been examined directly, nor have future expenditures by
the utilities and menufsctuters been factored nto the study. Use charges
for plutonium used in the JAD program amounting to about $40 million
discounted to 1970 were not: included. These represent sbout 1% of the
MD discounted expenditures’ and would not effect numericel vesults to
any noticeable degrees. Furthermore, 00 weight has been given to the
quite evident priority and sizable commitments which have also been

made to breeder prograams by the other countries with strong programe

for the exploitation of nuclear pover,

Cost-benefit analysis should be considered as only one of the many
elements of input pertinent to decision-making. Examination of results
of cost-benefits analyses conducted in the past, when compared to sctusl
program progress and status; indentiftes well those limitations inherent
in any such analyses and the continuing need to insure compatidility of
assumptions in the analyses vith the assumptions in the program plan.
The degree of sophistication of the model devel oped, the validity of

the assumptions made, the quality of the analysis iavolved, and the
nature of the analysis tovoived, aod the nature of the subject studied
all will affect the use of such an analysis in decision making. Particular
care must be taken to avoid the tendency to regard cost-benefit analysis
as an end unto itself; it will be a useful tool only if it fs properly

applied with full realization of the inherent limitations of such studies.

Such actions includs the degree of MD support given to the breeder pro-
gram by both the Government and todustry, as it will affect the date of

changes affecting capital coats and fuel cycle costs, including uranium
costs. A parsmeter over which there fs little control at the present,

0f particular importance is the degree to which associated programs ave

Accordingly, it is necessary that we proceed with the strongest possidle

In this enslysis, the Liquid Metal-Cooted Yast Breeder Reactor (LMFAR)
ls assumed to be the initial dreeder type commercially funtroduced into
the 0, S. electric power economy, The benefits vhich have been
salculated in this avalysis resulting from the introduction of the
LMFER are representative of the benefits to de achieved from the
successful introduction of a breeder or even two breeder types.

tho results of the cost-benefit snalysis depend upon assumptions which

san subatentially affect the future cost of electrical energy. Since

the prospective value of many of these variables is uscertain, the
sensitivities of undiscounted snd discounted benefits to changes in the
following key varisbles have been examined: timing of the introduction date
af the breeder; uranium costs; fossil fuel costs; electrical energy demands;
maergy costs, vhich include plant capital and fuel cycle costs; and discount

tates.

plus fossil fueled electrical generating plants. These calculations

   
 

were based ¢a 8 linesr progrematng nodel of the ited States

The model has besn prepared in conjunction with the activities of the
Systems Analyses Task Force which has deen working on civilisn nuclesr
power evaluations with the AEC Division of Reactor Development and
Technology.

The quantifiadle benefits discussed herein have been recognized since
the inception of nuclear power a8 the basis of support for breeder
prograns in the United States and in every major highly industrialized
country in the world, The other {important benefits, many less tangidle
and wore difficult to quantify than those quantifiadle in terms of
lover electrical energy cost, are of substantial consequence in any
meaningful review of the role which nuclear power and fossil fuel plants
can play in the future to mee: the erergy demands of the United States.
 

It has long been recogaised ‘that nuclear energy's full promise for

providing a virtually wlinited energy source for future gensrations

could only be realized through the development and spplication of the

breeder reactor. The U : s. Soterest in breeder resctors dates back to Ce
the Meshattan Project aaye, When the possibility wes first recogatsed
by plonsers in the muclesr ald, Tn 1543 Eurico Pernd cheered that,

"Ihe country which first develops a breeder reactor will have a grest
competitive advantage in atoate orgy.” To obtain this advantage,

 

 

the U, 8. nuclesr commmity has been vorking for over 20 years on the
breeder reactor. In 1943 the developmint of the plutonium fueled fast
breeder was estadlished as a major gosl dy the Argonne National Laboratory
Division of the Manhattan District Metallurgical Laborstory. The progres
has been continuous since that time, and the momentum now has duilt up

to the point where the large-scale introduction and commercial scceptance
of the breeder will de feasidle in the near future. Appendix A presents
some of the more significant. reviews and statements that have been made
over ths years on the national importance and potential of the dreeder

progran,

Mach of the essential effort on the breeder was conducted in the ARC

national laboratories. The Clementine reactor vas constructed at

Los Alamos and used from March 1949 to December 1952 to demonstrate the
feasibility of opersting with fast neutrons, plutonium fuel snd a liquid
metal coolant. The Experimental Breeder Reactor 1 (EER-1) was duilt
and operated by Argonns National Laboratory from August 1951 through
Decenber 1963 to prove the breeding principle in a fast flux vesctox
snd to estadlish the engineering feasidility of using liquid wetal
coolant.

Developments related to the operation in environments of fast flux and
hgh tesperature 11quid metal were initiated. These developments lod
to demonstrating the physics and safety of a fast flux neutron
spectrum Teactor, culatnating in the construction of two fast reactors
in the mid 1930's, the 62.3 Wit EBR-11 end the 200 Mit Yermi reactor.

Severs] factors mitigated against immediate success in terms of the
commercial exploitation of ‘the breeder reactor: the development effort was
focused largely on technological goals: the industrial involvement was min-
imal; and the breeder development participation was essentially confined

to the national laboratories, with the exception of the Fermi development
effort. The industrial groupe concentrated on the light water reactors

and the nuclear Navy, vhere success was nearer at hand. The proven

uranium resources sppesred sufficient to meet predicted requirements.
Though a relatively large technological base, including test facilities,
vas being developed in the laboratories, the breeder effort was diffuse

in terms of an engineering type of undertaking. In general, until the
nid-1960's, there appeared to be no urgent requirement to concentrate

the industrial resources on the breeder program.

 

 
In 1962, the AZC issued its Report to the President on Civilisn Nucleer
Power. This report clearly re-esphasised that the use of breeders
could solve the prodlem of an adequate and economic energy supply for
the future. The report cone luded that nuclear energy can and should
aske sn important snd eventually, s vital contribution toward meeting
our long term energy requirements, and that econcamic breeders were
essential to the long range major use of nucleas energy. The report
included a detailed discussion of the place to de occupied dy the

breeders in the oversll program.

Faced with the question of determining the future course to be taken

by the U., S. advanced reactor development programs, the AEC, in early
1965, initiated » series of overall technical reviews. These reviews

of the reactor program indicated a lack of important engineering
information and an {inadequacy of facilities and other resources necessary
to obtain that information There vas clear evidence of the need to
build up the engineering capabilities in the laboratories and fn industry
and to asmemble necessary and adequate resources to develop and produce

safe, relisdle and economical dreeder pover plants for operation in the

vtility environment. These early overall reviews further indicated a
requirement for in-depth reviews of each of the technical elements of
the dreeder program. Concurrently, it was necesssry to initiate detailed

plans for each of the elements of the breeder prograa.
on ep RR

During this period, remarkable advances were taking place in the
development of light water resctor power plants. As @ result,
nuclear power moved towerds widespread acceptance 8s a new source
of electricsl energy. The resultant unprecedented demand for light
watar power resctor plants, paralleled by greatly incressed urenium
demands snd “y projected large-scale plutonium production, provided
additional incentives for a move direct and concentrated effort on a
uaified breeder development progres than hitherto achieved. It was
recognized that the plutonium produced in light water reactors

could De most efficiently used in the fast breeder reactors and that
the breeder would measurably reduce uranium ore requirements. The
breeder development progres was thus invested with a sense of urgency
which had been lacking up to then.

In early 1967, the Atomic Energy Commission issued the 1967 Supplement
to the 1962 Report to the President on Civilisn Wuclesr Power. The
Supplement set forth the changes that had occurred since 1962, and
considered the ongoing AIC reactor programs im relation to the
recommendations of the 1962 report. The Supplement reaffirmed the
promise of the dresder for meeting our long term energy needs and
established the LMFBR program ss the highest priority civilian vesctor
development effort which would lesd to full commercial acceptance of
the breeder. The continuing AEC role of leadership was reviewed
relative to the development of nuclesr technology required te sssure

the nation that large amounts of low coat energy would be availadle

 

 

 
for the growing densnds. The steps taken to strengthen the industrial
snd utility capability requisite to the succeasful introduction of
the LR snd the timely development and commercial utilisation of the
fast breeders, in particularly the LMFER, were discussed.

In view of the established first priority, tha level of activity on
the LMFBR was considerably increased in Fiscal Years 1967, 1968 and
1969. The buildup to bring together the required resources, tocluding
manpover, fscilities, and funds has continued within the AEC, the AIC
laboratories, snd in other sectors of the nuclesr community. New
major test facilities are under construction snd other existing
facilities are being upgraded. Encouraged by the increased attention
and efforts of the Covernment, substantial commitments have been made
by the major reactor minufacturers and the utilities with a view to
neking large-scale commitments to the first LMFER demonstration plants
tn the 1970's. These {nvestments sre in addition to the heavy LMR

commitments.

In recognition of the importance of the fast breeder, the Edison
Electric Institute (n, an association of the private utilities,
conducted a detailed study of the status of fast breeder reactor
development. Their report vas published in April 1969. In the
Foreword of this report, the situation was stated as follows:
“The Subcommittee (EE1) on Fast Breeder Reactor Development
urges that all EE] members give the most careful consideration
to this report and to ways and mesns of {implementing the

recoemendationa set forth. In the entire industrial history

new concept. nt, “tha report brings out, there are
persuasive resscos, both {n terms of opportunity and responsi-
bility, to do 0 and strong incentives to do so promptly.”

The LMFBR Program Office at the Argonne National Laboratory has prepared
LZR Program Plans®, under the direction of the AEC, which Bave recently
been released. The Program Plans are national in scope and represent
the results of wany aoaths of discussions, reviews, and assessments
within the nuclear community. The Plans represent a major edvance in
the LMFBR program by setting forth in a comprehensive manner those
courses of action necessary for achieving the objectives of the LMFER
program. The Joint Comatttes on Atomic Energy of the Congress of

the Congress of the United States has observed that the LMFBR Program
Plans represent one of the most carefully thought-out long range
developmental efforts ever pursued by the U. S. Covernment.

This cont-besatit analysts’ tavolved am extensive systems analysis effort
and the development of: 8D costs for the fifty your period 1970 = 2020,

Eight groups of calculations vers performed to investigate the effects

of varying assumptions upon benefits accrued from an economy with a ven
breeder reactor as compared with an economy without a breeder, The

major assumptions elute to urentum costs, fossil fuel costs, electrical
energy demands, electrical edergy costs, and the intreduction date of

the breeder.

Three major quantifiable conclusions from the analysis are:

1. The breeder can produce not only large direct money benafits from
the low cost of electrical energy, but also other tangible quantitative
benefits, such as those associated vith reduced uranium requirements,
reduced uranium separative work requirements, and the large production

of plutonium.

2. The benefit/cost ratio is significantly greater than coe for most of
the cases having a discount rate of 7% or less. The danefit to cost ratios

fall below 1, for @ pusber of cases based on discount rates above 7%.

3. Deferring the presently planned LMFER RAD progran with consequent
delays in the introduction date does not substantially reduce the
present worth of the R&D expenditures. In all cases, deferring the

LMFBR R&D program incresses the undiscounted RAD costs.
 

 

The extent of the besatits y daternined | ta this analysis: depend upon

very complex research. ad development programs, ever-changing energy
patterus and industrial situations, and a 30-year time period during
which many industriel and technological advances may be anticipated,

yollowing are other Amportant conclusions:

1. The increased dollar denefits from reduced costs of electrical energy
alone, resulting from the early introduction of the breeder, provide
a major incentive for a timely and strong research and development

program, and even make a strong point for its acceleration.

2. Although an incresse in uranium ore costs is highly prodable, even &
constant Uy0g cost ($8/1b), with constant fossil fuel costs, and with
an early introduction of the LMFBR, provides substantial benefits for
discount rates below 7%, and substantial danefits for a 1980 Introduction

at 7% discount rate.

3. Early introduction of the breeder substantially reduces future uranium
ore demands.

4. Early introduction of the breeder substantially reduces future uranium

separative work demand.

The sualysts. shove a of sipiticant fovresse in benefits with a higher

The benefits accruing from the introduction of the breeder are affected
by changes in fossil fuel costs. These benefits would be increased
significantly if increases in fossil fuel costs are experienced.

Small changes in the cost of electrical energy from the breeder
cause significant changes in the benefits, with capital costs
being more important in this regard then fuel cycle costs.

In all cases considered with dreedir introduction, the nuclear
generating capacity by year 2020 represents an extremely large
percentage of the total electrical generating capacity available

for competition between fossil fueled and nuclear fueled power plants.

Discount rates substantially sbove 7% seriously affect dollar benefits
because of low present worth in 1970 of large undiscounted gross
benefits for the latter part of the 50 year period as compared

with the high present worth in 1970 of RAD sxpenditures in the

These assupticas relate to urentus fuel costs, fossil fuel costs

of the introduction of the breeder. The characteristics of the
eight groups are summarized in Table 1. Bach group consists

of a base case without a breeder compared with cases with a breeder
represented by the LMFBR. Case 1.3a and other "a" cases cover

a parallel breeder program. The benefits of introducing the
breeder in different years were determined by covparison with the
base cases without a bresder., The four parsmeters studied included
the intrcduction date of the breeder, the cost of uranium, the

cost of fossil fuel, and the energy demand, Groups 1, 3, 4,

and 6, provide & measure of how varying energy denands affect
benefits for assumed rising uranium costs and constant iossil

fuel costs. Similarly, groups 2, 7, and 8 provide a measure of how
varying energy demands affect benefits for assumed constant $8 per

treeder RAD costs very from 0.2 billion to $2.2 billion.
Significantly, éiscounted RSD costs actually imresse for delays
to 1936 and 1990. Costs of $2.3 billion for the current program
increase to $2.6 billion for 1986 and 1990 introduction.

Basic vesson for the increase or relatively small change im discounted
RAD costs for delayed introduction of the breeder, is the additiomal
RSD costs incurred in the stretchout of a program. The stretchout
involves expenditures in phasing-down or phasing-out programe; and
expenditures in re-starting a program, including those costs associated
vith the difficulc task of resssembling resources, replacing lost
personnel, retraining of personnel, and the updating of deteriorated
facilities and equipment.

‘from es wil #0 8 reduction of maximum

   

Discomend to 1970 at n, the Feosent wrth gross beats for the
current peogrea from lowes energy costs alos Tesge from 41.8 to
$13.2 di114ca. “The highest value is associated with rising fossil
fuel and urenium costs (Case 5.3), while the lowest 1s associated
with constant fossil fuel and urenium costs and an intermediate
energy demand (Cage 8.2). Other major tangible benefits are
reduction in air pollution, the production of & large supply of
energy producing plutonium, the large reduction in sepsrative

work demand, and efficient and economic use of the depleted
uranium stockpile.

 

Of the cases studied, the most prodable case is associated

vith rising uranium costs, constant fossil fuel costs,

a dase energy demand, and with the currently planned fntroduction of
the ixeeder in 1984 (Case 1.3, Tables 3 and 4). The results of this
case show undlscounted gross benefits of $207 billion, gross discounted
bdenafits of $9.1 billion, net benefits accruing to the breeder program
of $6.6 billion, and a benefit/cost ratio of 3.6. This case would also
result in a reduction in Uy03 requirements of 1450 kilotons, and a
reduction in maximum separstive work demand of 85 kilotonnes per year.

3.3.3 Early Introduction of the Breedsr
Benefit/cost ratios ranging from 7.9 to 0.7 result from those

cases with an introduction of the breeder in 1984 or earlier, for
all 8 groups analyzed, as shown in Table 3. The higher values are
associated with rising fossil fuel costs.

3.3.4 Parallel Breeder Program
Based on assumptions delineated below, a tentative case can de

nade to improve the industrial breeder base by establishing a parallel
breeder program. The benefits of the LMFBR program would be sufficient
to maintain benefit/cost ratios in excess of one for a 1984, or earlier
introduction of the LMFBR and a 1992 introduction of the parallel breeder
for 8 of the 11 cases considered, and using discount rates of 7% or
less. Because of the technical status and other factors, the decision
cn whether to establish a parallel breeder program would have to await
further analyses of alternative breeder concepts, such as the light
water breeder reactor, the molten salt breeder resctor, or the gas.
cooled fast breeder. Such analyses would lead to considerations for
possibly selecting one of these as a basis for initiating a full scale
parallel dreeder development program.

If justified dy further analysis, a parsllel breeder program could
strengthen the nuclear posture of the U. 3. by providing for increasing
industrial competition, by broadening the industrisl nuclear manufacturing

 

 

base, by broadening the base of other associated sectors, and by strengthening

the industrial base of nuclear technology. The cost-benefit analysis has

the dectaion vas ssnumed to be that other alternates and/or backups

would not be pursued after the Lo dectaton date, ‘

The following list summarizes and expands the assumptions stated:

Assumptions for Parallel Breeder

(1) It is assumed that the PBR would benefit from the LMFBR
‘program as indicated in Table 2. The total costs of the
R&D for ‘Other Sresdars, shown in Table 2, are Lover than
for the LMFBR: $2.0 billion MFR undiscounted direct

(2) The LMFBR R&D program would be the same as for Plan B-1
with a 1984 IMFBR introduction.

(3) Decision to proceed with PBR to be made in FY 1972.

(4) No support for alternates or backups after FY 1972.

Discussion of Parallel Breeder Results

Table 2 indicates that a parallel full scale development program will cost
$5.6 billion undiscounted, or an additional $1.6 billion above the current
breeder program, assuming introduction of the LMFBR in 1984 and the parallel
breeder in 1992, Discounted at 7%, the additional present worth fn 1970

will be $0.7 billion.

The benefit/cost ratios range from 4.8 to 0.6 for a parallel breeder program
for all 8 groups, assuning a 1984 introduction cf the LMFBR and a 1992 intro-
duction of the PBR as contrasted to a range from 6.1 to 0.7 for the current
breeder program for all 8 groups (Table 3). The results indicate that the
early introduction of the LMPBR provides tangible, quantifiable benefits
sufficiently large to adequately support the cost of a parallel breeder
program for most of the cases studies at discount rates of 7% or less, and
at discount rates up to 10% with both rising fossil and rising uranium

costs and with a base energy demand.

The sensitivity of benefits to changes ina parameter provides an indication
of the extent to vhich uncertainty plays a part in the perturbations
associated with this change, The following summarizes the sensitivity

of the parameters noted.

1. Breeder Introduct ion Date

Though, for most cases, benefits result from savings in
energy costs regardless of its date of introduction into the commercial
market, these benefits are substantially affected by the date of
breeder introduction. For example, examination of Tables 3 and 4
shows, for Groups 1 and 2, that a ten year delay in the current
date of breeder introduction will result in an increased 50-year
energy cost of $131 billion dollars (undiscounted) with rising

uranium costs (Group 1), and $54 billion (undiscounted) with constant
uranium costs (Group 2). Figures 1 and 2 show IMFBR program un-
discounted and discounted benefits for different IMFBR introduction
dates assuming congtant fossil fuel costs, and a base energy demand

for both rising and constant uranium costs (Groups 1 and 2). The

Cases 1.3b, 2.3b, and 5.3b (R&D Plan B-3) involving a two year delay
in the introduction of the breeder were extrapolated from computer
results for Cases 1.3-1.4; 2.3-2,4; and 5.35.4; 1.e., years 1984
and 1990, Discounted gross benefits for Group 1 Case 1.3b will be

reduced to o billion as compared to $9. 1 billion for 1984 intro-

  

duction case 1, Hor a net reduction of $1.7 billion; net benefits are
reduced from $6.6 billion to '$4.8 billion and benefit/cost ratio is
reduced from 3.6 to 2,8, Of interest is the fact that the present
worth of the R&D costs is actually increased by $0.1 billion, 1i.e.,
RSD costs are $2.6 billion for 1986 introduction vs. $2.5 billion for

1984 introduction, Results of Cases 2.3b and 5.3b are shown in Table 3.

2, Uranium Cost
The effect of uranium cost is indicated by comparing

Cases 1.1 and 2.1 with Cases 1.3 and 2,3 in Table 3 for LMFBR
introduction in 1984. The only parameter changed from Group 1 to
Group 2vwes the uranium cost. The discounted cumulative energy cost
increases by $10.3 billion over 50 years, for an economy without an
ILMFBR (Case 2.1 to Case 1.1) with an average increase of $12.60 per
pound of U30g, compared with a $3.5 billion increase for an economy
with an LMFBR (Case 2,3 to Case 1.3) and an average increase of

$2.50 per pound of U30g.

3. Possil Fuel Costs
Increased discounted gross benefits for the breeder of
$6.1 billion ($15.2 billion less $9.1 billion) accrue with a 1984

LMFBR introduction, assuming rising fossil fuel and uranium costs

The resulting sensitivity is about a 7% change in discounted gross : :

$600 million accruing over the 50-year period to an economy with a :

breeder. The converse with decreasing fossil fuel costs would hold to

a lesser extent.

4. Electrical Energy Demand
The following table shows the projections used in the analysis for

the total electrical energy demand grewth rate percentages and associated
doubling times for the demand, These projections were averaged for 1970

5, Eneray Cost (Capital and Fuel Cycle) Ce
The total discounted energy costs are quite sensitive to
changes in the LMFBR energy costs. The following IMFBR ‘energy cost

breakdown 1s provided as an ‘approximate reference. for a 1990 ILMFBR:

 

Mills/Kwhr
~~ Capital Cnn 3.2
Operation and Maintenance : 0.3
Fuel Cycle : 0.6
TOTAL 4.1

Figure 5 shows the discounted benefits for an economy with an IMFBR
with rising uranium costs and constant fossil fuel costs as a
function of the change in IMFBR energy cost, Over the range
investigated, the benefits increase about $1.6 billion for each

0.1 mill/kwhr decrease in energy cost. The sensitivity of capital
costs 1s such that a 17% decrease in capital cost will cause about
4% increase in discounted benefits. Because the fuel cycle cost

is a smaller absolute number, a 5% reduction in fuel cycle cost

is required to provide an equivalent 4% increase in discounted benefits.

6. Uranium Requirements
Table 4 provides an indication of the substantial savings

in uranium to be gained from the early development of the breeder.
Assuning Group 1 parameters of rising uranium costs, constant fossil
costs, and base electrical demands, the results shows a reduction
in 50-year U30g requirements of 1449 kilotons of U30g for an economy
with a 1984 breeden as compared to an economy without an IMFBR

(Case 1.3 vs. Case 1.1), A 10-year delay or a 1994 introduction
of the breeder results in a reduction of only 750 kilotons of

U30g, as compared to an economy with no LMFBR (Case 1.5 vs. Case 1.1),
Assuming Group 2 constant uranium costs, constant fossil costs,

and base electrical demands, the results show a reduction in uranium
requirements of 3211 kilotons for the 1984 breeder introduction
date as compared to no LMFBR (Case 2,3 vs. Case 2.1). A 10«ear
delay or a 1994 introduction of the breeder in this situation
results in a reduction in uranium requirements of only 136 kilotons

of U30g as compared to no LMFBR (Case 2.5 vs. Case 2.1).

7. Separative Work Demand

The cost-benefit analysis provides no treatment of the
effect of the breeder on uranium separation capacity. Table 4 does
provide a quantitative set of numbers for the separative work demand

Factors to be considered in (determining the need for Government sponsorship
are many and varied, They include the magnitude of the program which

may exceed industry's capability and resources, prospects for returns

far off in time, and wide dispersion of program benefits throughout
society. Other factors have been discussed in the Introduction,

the Summary, and under Other Considerations,

37

 
‘The: ‘Interdepartmental ‘Energy Study report, prepared by the Energy
Study Group in 1964, "Energy R&D and National Progress," states that
..the whole topic of choice of an appropriate Government discount rate,
particularly 1 in reference to R&D, 18 an unresolved problem, involving
many viewpoints, ‘subtle’ ‘and controversial’ issues, and differing value
judgments, The report adds that the determination (both qualitiative
and quantitative) of the discount rate that the Government might use
18 a matter of continuing controversy among professional economists,

Testimony given in 1967 and 1968 at hearings before the Subcommittee

on Economy in Government of the Joint Economic Committee brought out

a wide range of ‘judgments applicable to this problem, and indicated that
much work lies ahead before reasonable objective criteria can be
established to serve as guidelines in the selection of discount rates
for application to Government programs, A common understanding and
agreement on the conceptual basis for discounting must be achieved,
following which agreement must be reached on the method or methods for
calculating discount rates to be used,

In the Cost-Benefit-Analysis, benefits were calculated after taxes, R&D
costs were enumerated without reference to taxes and a discount rate
representing the after-tax return for utilities was used. If one

were per forming the analysis on a social account basis, as favored by
some economists, one would calculate benefits and costs on a pre-tax
basis and use a discount rate representing the pre-tax rate of return
of the relevant portion of the private sector.

The LMFBR program can be identified with the utility sector of the

U. 8, economy, and the rate of return applicable to that sector has
been considered as the criterion rate for evaluation of public
investments in this area.. The discount rates applicable to the electric
utility industry would most nearly comply with this criterion. While

it is doubtful, as stated, that the electric utility industry would
undertake a program of this magnitude, it is this sector of the economy
which will be in the money market to obtain funds with which to finance
capital investments, and it is in this sector in which benefits accruing
to the public good will be obtained.

38

 
Proceeding on this'basis, our. ‘analysis: shows: ‘that a discount;rate 5

The actual average rate of return for all electric utilities privately
owned in the U. S. was 6.7% in 1964, 6,9% {n 1965, and was

estimated to be 6,9% for 1966. The actual average fraction of
capital in bonds for all electric utilities privately owned was

0.523 in 1966 and 0,515 in 1965 with fraction in equity « 0,477 and

0.485 respectively.

It 1s recognized that the cost of money has increased since 1967,

when the assumptions noted above were nade for a systens analysis )
study. Assuming a 10% return on equity and an increase to 6% on
corporate bonds, and maintaining the same equity to-bond ratio,

the cost of money would increase to 7. 92 versus 7,0% used in the
analysis, Since the assumptions for the ‘near programoing analysis
were made in 1967 and, to maintain the time schedule for this analysis,

the 7% cost of money has been retained, Further, the 7% cost was

based on private investment, A mixture of private plus local, state,

 

 

 

regional, and Federal investments would more closely approximate the

7%, even today.

5 7, 10 and 12,5% are given in Tables 5 through 8. Table 6 is a

repeat of Table 3. However, before discussing the results given in
these tables, it is illo to consider the effect 1 the choice

‘of ‘discount rate can have over the 50-year period conssdered in this
study. Figure 6, Present Worth of $100 Spent Ten and Fifty Years in the
Future Versus the Discount Rate, indicates that an increase from

5 to 12.5% in the discount rate results in a reduction of the present
worth by about a factor of 30 for expenditures 50 years in the future.
This large sensitivity of benefits from events in the distant future
as a function of discount rate becomes readily apparent in the results,
The effect of expenditures 10 years in the future on present worth, as
compared to 50 years in the future, is clearly shown in Figure 6.

Tables 5 through 8 show that the maximum net discounted benefits range

from $38.7 billion for the 5% discount rate to net dollar losses for

most of the 10 and 12,5% discount rate cases.

3.3.7 Discussion of Assumptions

Fuel Cycle Costs
The fuel cycle costs associated with the LMFBR are probably

conservative since they were based on present technology modified
for an increase in scale of plants. Improvements in technology
in the next 50 years should markedly reduce these costs and

measurably increase benefits,

Energy Demand
Though the validity of any of the electrical demand projections may

be at issue, there is little question that electricity penetration of the
energy market is increasing at the expense of other forms of direct energy
use. The differential cost of producing energy which has been displaced
should appropriately be credited if the additional penetration is due

to decreased costs of a new form of energy such as that from an LMFBR.

This was not done in this analysis.

Termination of Analysis
The arbitrary termination of the analysis at the point of high

slope in kilowatt-hour additions has been too conservative, Purther,
benefits from plante operating in year 2020 which have continuing
lives of up to 30 years are not adequately accounted for. A more

realistic model needs to be developed.

Advanced Converter
The assumption of advanced converter development program success,
followed by a large scale introduction of the advanced converter, leads

to large scale installations of the advanced converter, and substantially

Uranium Costs to

A uranium cost schedule intermediate between the constant
$8/1b uranium cost and the uranium cost schedule based on the AEC
cost projections (half-way between $8/1b and Table 13 Schedule)
vas studied to further determine the sensitivity of benefits to -
uranium cost, One group included cases with constant fossil fuel
costs, a base energy demand, a non-breeder base case with LWR and
HIGR, and cases with 1980, 1984, 1990 and 1994 LMFBR introduction,

The intermediate Uranium cost schedule (with advanced converters)
results in small changes in benefits as compared to cases using

4.0 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

Although the results of the cost-benefit analysis clearly support the
development of the breeder in accordance with the current planning
schedule, it is evident that the results of quantifiable economic
analysis are only one #lement to be considered in deterntatog the
values of such davelopuental attorts. As described in the 1962 Report
to the President and its 1967 Supplement, nuclear power, in addition
to the benefits resulting from lower cost power, has a number of other
advantages of tremendous importance and potential from a near term

and long term standpoint, both here in the United States and throughout
the rest of the world, Numbers cannot be assigned to intangibles,

and judgment values in many cases have to predominate, Major benefits
in many cases are not readily susceptible to measurement, but

{n terms of national objectives are of substantial consequence.

For example, the success of the breeder program would, in the not too
distant future, provide:

(1) access to virtually limitless sources of electricity at a low

cost;

(2) an ample supply of electricity to areas which have been denied
low cost power because of distance from fossil fuel sources or
hydro resources;

(3) virtual elimination of air pollution from nuclear fueled electrical

power plants;

Need for Electrical Energy

The availability of energyand, in particular, low cost energy,
holds the key to obtaining significant improvements in the
standard of living in developing areas and to sustaining the
planned growth of the more highly industrialized areas. With

the passage of tine, the demand for electricity, a most useful

total v. s. electric generating capacity, which amounted to
267,000 Mie at the end of 1967, is expected to grow to 523,000 MWe
in 1980, and to about 1,600,000 Mie in 2000, based on the base

projection of electrical energy demand used in this analysis.

The electric utility industry of this country is increasingly
using large-scale nuclear power plants to meet the demands for
electricity. - This decision to rely on nuclear power has been made
in large measure as a result of substantial Government encourage-

Large-Scale Commitments to R&D Program

The role of the Government is to establish an advanced reactor
nuclear power program which has as its objective the development
of breeders, which can make available the full potential of

nuclear fuels,

The nuclear comunity is actively involved in conducting the R&D
for the breeder program. A number of ma jor facilities are in i
operation, being built, or are in the planning stage, In addition
to the AEC sponsored work, substantial investments have been
committed to the LMFBR program by the nuclear industry and
utilities in terms of funds, manpower, and facilities. The.
determination of the AEC to ‘carry the LMFBR forward on a national

basis, along with the strong economic incentives, have been key

factors in obtaining commitments and participation by industry

In addition to the AEC- funded and-directed program, the reactor

menufacturers an and nuclear ortented utilities have publicly announced
that they are 7 proceeding vith privately financed studies and
broad technological development programs complementary to the
AEC-sponsored efforts, ' The reactor manufacturers are annually
investing a total of more than $20 million, Statements regarding
the corporate commitments of major reactor manufacturers to

fast breeder reactor development are presented in Appendix B.

In addition to this, approximately 50 of the leading electrical
utility companies are participating financially and technically
in one or more of the reactor manufacturer-sponsored programs.

In the spring of 1968, the annual level of utility effort was
estimated to be about $6 million, excluding the continuing commit

ments to Fermi and SEFOR, Utility commitments are summarized in

Appendix C.

Experience has shown that the successful power reactor
concepts are those in which there has been strong industrial

participation and utility involvement during the developmental

period, The ultimate objective 1s the ostablishment, at an early
date, of a self-sufficient and compatitive LMFBR nuclear power
industry which can provide. the cocmercial breeder needed in our
economy. Steps to achieve this objective have been taken, and
considerable progress has been achisved.

Coupling of Breeder to IHR Commitments

The early introdustion of the brasder will provide significant
reduction in the long range requirement for enriched uranium

and, in the case of the fast breeders, provide optimm utilization
of the plutonium that will be produced in the light water reactors.
(The AEC estimate of the plutonium contained in irradiated fuel
after final discharge from light water reactors in the U. 8.

through 1980 1s more than 100,000 Kg*,)

The strong economic, technical, and industrial coupling characteristic
of the light water and fast breeder reactors employing the uranium .
238-plutonium fuel cycle is important to establishing the flexible
transition to a fast breeder dominant complex, The industrial

and utility support for the LMFBR reinforces this conclusion,

uranium ore roquirensats and separative work required by the

Tie FOES

R's and other uranium consuntng reactors, to a minimal amount,

Fuel Cycle

Substantial private investments have been made and industrial
competence developed with respect to the fabrication of mixed
oxide plutonium bearing fuel elements in this country for
recycle of this fuel in the LWR, as well as for eventual

use in the IMFBR, This capability over the next ten years

can be increased by providing fuel for plutonium recycle in the
IWR, for the FFTF, and for LMFBR demonstration plants. Thus,
the required fuel cycle capabilities should be well established
when the LMFBR is introduced on a commercial basis in the 1980's.
There is little question that the industrial experience with the
1ight water reactor fuel cycle will be of great importance in

establishing an IMFBR fuel cycle industry.

58
 

 

 

4.8

A number of countries, including France, Germany, Italy,

Japan, the USSR, and the United Kingdom, have established a high
priority for the development of the fast breeder reactor as a
matter of national policy. Each of these countries has committed
substantial resources toward achieving this goal. It is
estimated that these countries, excluding the USSR, are spending
over $150 million per year on fast breeder R&D programs.

Appendix D summarizes the major foreign fast breeder reactor
programs and considers the implications of these programs on

the economy and technological posture of the U. S.

World Market

The development of a commercial LMFBR by United States industry can
have a beneficial impact on the United States balance of payments
position. Though the country which is first able to produce an
economic and reliable fast breeder reactor may occupy a strong
position from the standpoint of initially capitalizing on the
available worldwide market for breeder reactors, the domination

of a foreign market will depend on many other factors, These

include price structure, simplicity of plant operation and maintenance,
and reactor characteristics, Several West European countries

are planning to introduce a fast breeder reactor into the commercial
environment in the late 1970's and early 1980's. The U. S. is
planning to oommence LMFBR operation in the early 1980's,
Substantial sales of both LWR's and breeders will be gained

by the U., S. - both for the near and far term - if the current

programs are guccessfully achieved. See Appendix D for further details.

Truman and. has been reiterated by each succeeding President. Strengthening
of the IMFBR program will enhance the pssture of the United States.

There is little question that the USSR would exploit any failure

on the part of the U, 8. to maintain its leadership in this field.

To appreciate this, one need only have witnessed the aggressive

program presented by the USSR at the World Power Conference held

in Moscow in August 1968 with regard to its position in the area

of peaceful application of the atom to nuclear power.

Electricity and Other Processes

Whereas the most readily quantifiable benefit from the breeder
program will be the reduction in cost of electricity in mills per
kilowatt hour and of heat in cents per million Btu, the indirect
benefits of cheaper energy are extremely far reaching. A small

incremental savings in the cost of energy will open up new horizons

5.0 MAJOR ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS

The following assumptions used in this analysis are based on presently,
available information. The results of the analysis are only as accurate
as the mmbers associated with the assumptions. However, as noted
elsevhere, the sensitivity of the benefits to changes in the parameters
associated with these assumptions are fairly valid and of direct

interest,

5.1 Discount Rates
Decisions on appropriate discount rates should be made on a case
by case basis. The application of high discount rates could cause
the Government to ignore investments of great potential benefit
to the country which only the Government can undertake in favor
of continued investments by the private sector. For most of
the cases examined in this analysis a 7% discount rate has been
used. The 7% discount rate was adopted by the AEC Systems Analyses
Task Force in 1967 and used in the projection of the nuclear power
economy that served as a basis for this study. For purposes of
comparison and discussion, the model also discounted the objective
function, which has already been minimized with the 7% value, for
discount rates of 5, 10, and 12,5 percent. In no event was the

internal cost of money, 7%, changed in the analysis.

per year for the next wo years, 16 - 1000 Mie plants per year

5.3 Capital Costs Of Plants y
The capital costs utiltzed in the model for the LMFBR cost benefits
study are shown in Figure 8. These are estimated 1970 costs,
averaged for the U., 8. and they reflect, to the extent possible,
the following factors:

a, Increased cost of money.
b, Inflation in cost: of ‘materials and labor to 1970,
c. Experience with plants constructed to date and on order.
d. The effects of projected cost reductions,

BEE

e, Effects of mode of construction (shop versus field, improve-
: ‘ments’ in engineering and utilization of facilities), and
related quality assurance practices.

f. Contingency allowance.

These costs represent data available in the fall of 1968, All of the
data had, as yet, not reflected Items a, b, and £, It is expected that

complete factual data would increase the estimated costs,

Mass Balance and Reactor Performance

The mass balance of each reactor was based on reactor performance
numbers shown in Table 11. Two sets of values were assumed for
the LMFEBR, one for the initial introduction of the LMFBR and a
second for advanced IMFBR's. The reactors inbroduced in

the first 6 yearsyere assumed to maintain low specific power and
igh specific inventory for the 30 years of life. In practice,

advanced cores would replace the earlier cores.

Three of the several types of light water reactors used in the
analysis are shown in Table 11, representing (1) LWR with only
enriched uranium feed, (2) LWR enriched with only plutonium
feed for first 4 years, then enriched with uranium-235, and

(3) LWR enriched with only plutonium feed for first 10 years,
uranium-235 thereafter, This simplified method was used in the

computer rung to represent non-recycle and recycle LWR's.

Fuel Cycle Costs
The systems analysis model utilized unit costs of fuel fabrication,

chemical preparation, conversion, and chemical reprocessing which
have been computed based on fuel mass flows for the entire life of
each reactor considered. The code used is applicable to reactor
systems in which the number of reactors installed is changing
with time, and in which several different kinds of reactors are
used. Based on assumptions developed by the AEC Fuel Recycle

and Systems Analyses Task Forces, representative results are shown

in Table 12.

Uranium Costs’
Uranium costs were assumed to be rising for 5 of the 8 groups

Table 13. This table was developed, for computer purposes,

from the AEC Uranium Reserve estimates shown in Table 14. For
Groups 2, 7, and 8 (Table 1), the uranium cost was assumed to

be constant at $8 per pound U30g. Future uranium discoveries

will probably result in an intermediate cost, more closely approxi.
mating the rising than the constant cost assumption. The analysis
did include some consideration of intermediate costs, as discussed
in this report. The analysis further assumed that there was no
import or export of fissile or fertile material.

Atomic Energy Commission,

"Clearly: The overall object 's

The overall obiective of the Commission's nuclear
power program should be to foster and support the growing use
of nuclear energy and, importantly, to guide the program in
such directions as to make possible the exploitation of the

vast energy resources latent in the fertile materials,
uranium=238 and thorium.

"More specific objectives may be summarized as follows:

and economically attractive, The Government must take the lead

in this regard."

"Thug, the future program should include the vigorous development
and timely introduction of improved converters and especially of
economic breeders; the latter are essential to long-range major

1967 Supplement to the 1962 Report to the President on Civilian

Nuclear Power, U, S, Atomic Energy Commission.

"...Intensive development of the high gain breeder over the long te:
has been undertaken as recommended by the 1962 Report,

"The objectives expressed in the 1962 Report are still regarded as
valid. The Commission intends to continues to exercise positive
and vigorous leadership in achieving the technical goals and in
assuring growing participation by the nuclear industry as nuclear
power becomes economic, ' : : :

"The fast breeder, with a potential for a doubling time of 8 to 10
years, can most efficiently use the fertile uranium-238 in depleted
and natural uranium,

"The fast breeders of major interest are divided into three
categories - sodium cooled, gas cooled and steam cooled, The
sodium cooled fast breeder has been established as the priority
program on the basis of potential economy, reactor manufacturer
interest, and technological experience gained in the U, 8S. and
abroad, Worldwide interest is concentrated on the sodium cooled
breeder...." :

Energy R&D and National Progress: Findings and Conclusions, An
Interdepartmental Study, September 1966.

"While private industry will probably concentrate on improving
existing commercial reactors, the Government should play a key
role in developing more advanced reactors with better fuel
utilization, Present development schedules should be maintained
80 as to accomplish development and final commercial application
within the normally expected 15 year time period. Concurrently,
the Government should encourage development of more than one
breeder or near breeder concept as a hedge against possible
failure of any one approach."

Fast Breeder Reactor Report, Edison Electric Institute, April 1968.

"The long range benefits from the use of fast breeder reactors in
nuclear power generation have been recognized for two decades;
however only recently has widespread interest in the expeditious
development of breeders for commercial application become manifest,

"There are strong economic incentives for the electric utility

industry to participate in the development of the fast breeder
reactor."

Speeches

b.

Remarks by W. Kenneth Davis, Director, Division of Reactor
Development, U, S. Atomic Energy Commission, Fast Reactor
Information Meeting, Chicago, Illinois, November 20, 1957.

"If we ask ourselves why there should be a substantial effort
on fast reactors, 1 think a major reason to be given is the
promise of nuclear breeding, Fast reactors offer a proven
means of utilizing to the maximum the energy stored in
uranium - not just that in the U-235 (0.71 percent of natural
uranium) or even that which can be obtained by a plutonium
recycle in thermal reactors which is only two or three times
the natural U-235 content,

“The fast reactor systems offer, in addition to the advantagrs
of high temperature and long fuel life, the attractive possi-
bili.y of breeding, and thus are probably the most important
systems which we have under study when looked at from the

long range viewpoint. The idea of conservation of nuclear
fuel, which can best be realized by development of breeder
concepts, 1s of such importance to our program that we have
made it the subject of a separate objective of our long range
program.”

Remarks by Dr. Frank K, Pittman, Director, Division of Reactor
Development, U, S, Atomic Energy Commission, Fast Breeder
Power Conference, Detroit, Michigan, December 3, 1963.

"To this end, the objective of the Commission's nuclear power
program for the long-range future is clearly identified: {it
is to guide the program in such direction as to make possible
the exploitation of the vast energy resources latent in the
fertile materials, thorium and uranium-238. We are still
involved in some of the first steps toward the realization of
this long-term objective, Successfully attaining this
objective will assure that we can obtain maximum benefit from
our low cost uranium reserves and render relatively unimportant
the cost of nuclear raw materials so that even very low-grade
sources will become economically acceptable.”

Remarks by AEC Commissioner Dr. Gerald P, Tape, Third
International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic

Energy, Geneva, Switzerland, August 31, 1964,

The basic purpose of nuclear power research and development in

the United States is to provide an additional and alternate
energy source to meet present and future demands thereby providing
timely protection for the nation against rising power costs and
eventual fuel shortages. The long term objective will be met
through the development of commercial breeder reactors capable of
utilizing the vast potential of the world's nuclear resources."

Remarks by Dr. Glenn T, Seaborg, Chairman, U, S. Atomic Energy
Commission, American Power Conference, Chicago, Illinois,
April 25, 1967.

"In speaking to the British Nuclear Energy Society last October,
I outlined the reasons why I believe we must move ahead rapidly
to the development of more efficient means of using our basic
nuclear energy resources - the world's vast, but not unlimited,
supply of uranium and thorium. Projections of the world's
increasing population, its rising rate of consumption of energy,
and its evea proportionally greater increase in the use of
electricity, combine to show an urgent need for developing
economically competitive nuclear reactors which will burn,

8. Remarks by Comnissioner Wilfrid BE. Johnson, U. S. Atomic

Energy Commission, ANS Topical Meeting, San Francisco, California,
April 10, 1967.

"The ultimate step in extending fuel supplies is in getting
many times the present 1 to 2% of energy latent in uranium
transformed into economically useable form. Our ability to
make more than a few percent of this latent energy available
at all, requires the breeder-type of reactor, and to get this
energy into the economy requires that nuclear breeding plants
be economic. To achieve this goal will require that Government
and industry each pursue complementary roles."

American Public Power Association's 1965 Annual Convention
Los Angeles, California, May 4, 1965.

"If we are successful in developing advanced converters and
near term breeders utilizing thorium we will succeed in
multiplying our energy resources as much as 50 times. If

we successfully tackle and accomplish the much more difficult
goal of high yield breeder reactors we will have achieved
unlimited supplies of energy."

i. Remarks by Congressman Wayne Aspinall, Twelfth Annual
Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, Denver, Colorado,
June 21, 1966.

"If the breeder reactor can be successfully developed-~ and
we are confident that it can-- it will meet the world's

© energy needs for the indefinite future. I can think of no
finer bequest to succeeding generations than that,"

J. Remarks by Representative Craig Hosmer (R-Calif), ANS Meeting,
San Diego, California, June 13, 1967.

"Continued large reserch and development costs to round out
the national nuclear power capability in the form of advanced
converters and breeders makes continued substantial government
participation in these areas mandatory for another 15 years
or 80.

k. Statement by Philip Sporn, President of American Electric
Power Service Corporation, before the Joint Committee on
Atomic Energy, July 17, 1964.

“This program (reactor development program) should be aimed at
the development of advanced reactors which make more efficient
use of nuclear fuels than do our present light water reactors,
Selection of specific concepts and the setting up of develop-
ment schedules in this program must be determined so as to be
consistent with the overall and developing energy needs and
policies of this country. In particular, it is my judgment
that we need to focus both on reactors which can utflize thorium
efficiently and on fast breeders. Moreover, I believe that the
potential economic performance of each of these reactors must
be considered every bit as seriously as their ability to
extend our nuclear fuel resources, for we can afford neither
the waste of our fuel rescurces nor our manpower and other
resources all of which are integrated in the final figure of
economic performance,"

Excerpts from the Budget of the United States Government.
a. FY 1964 Budget. man :

"Expenditures in 1964 for the development of economic civilian
nuclear power are estimated at’ $244 million, an increase of

$34 million over 1963, In line with the Commission's recent
Report to the President on Civilian Nuclear Power, increasiag
emphasis will be placed on reactors which produce more fuel than:
they consume ("breeders"). Breeders will be necessary if
nuclear energy is to make a significant contribution to the
national power supply in the long run.”

b. FY 1965 Budget.

"Increased emphasis will be placed on reactors which produce more
fuel than they consume ('‘breeders”), and efforts will be continued
to develop certain other advanced reactors.

"In 1965 ‘particular emphasis will be given to "breeder" power
reactors, which would produce more fissionable material than
they consume, and to the area of nuclear safety."

¢. FY 1966 Budget.

"The Commission is also working toward the long-range objective
of high-gain breeder reactors which produce significantly more
fuel than they consume, These breeders would insure a tremendous
energy source for centuries to come.”

“Continued emphasis will be given to the development of reactors
which produce significantly more fuel than they consume ("high-
gain breeders") as the long-range objective for civilian power
reactors."

82

d.

I? 1967 Budget.

"with the increasingly widespread acceptance and use of
nuclear power reactors, the efforts of the Federal
Government are focused upon development of improved

designs which will use nuclear fuels more efficiently and
produce electric power at lower cost. Work on the so-called
"fast breeder" reactors--which would produce more fuel than
they consume--will be intensified, with design in 1967 of a
special test reactor, expected to cost about $75 million."

FY 1969 Budget.

“The principal element of AEC's program in this area 18 the
effort to develop an economic fast breeder reactor, which
promises to produce more fissionable nuclear material than
is consumed in the process of producing power. This long-
term program will be intensified further in 1969."

Excerpts from AEC Annual Reports to Congress.

C,

CY 1958 AEC Annual Report.

"Past reactors occupy an important place in nuclear power
programs because their ability to produce more fuel than

they consume is potentially important to conservation of

fissionable material resources."

CY 1963 AEC Annual Report.

“The third implementing phase of the AEC's civilian nuclear
reactor power program is the conduct of an intensive, long-
range effort to develop breeder reactors which will make
possible the use of the full potential energy available in
nuclear fuels,"

"Good technical progress has been made on the breeder concept
which has been under study for a number of years. Its
technology, however, is extremely complex and much research
and development remains to be done before breeder reactors
approach an economically attractive stage of development,"

CY 1967 AEC Annual Report.
"With industry's acceptance of the light water reactors, the

AEC has now given the highest priority to the development of
liquid metal-cooled fast breeder reactors (IMFBR)."

9. Excerpts from Reports of the JCAE on AEC Authorizing
Appropriations for the AEC,
a. FY 1965 Budget.

“This year's request for the civilian power reactor
program reflects a shift in emphasis from the first
generation of light or ordinary water-type reactors

to the next phase which has as its objective the
development of reactors which utilize nuclear fuel more
efficiently. As the AEC indicated in its November 1962
report to the President, it 1s only nuclear energy which
holds the promise of meeting the Nation's long-term
energy requirements and in this connection, only those
reactors which permit more efficient utilization of fuel,
or contribute to the ultimate goal of breeding, should
be pursued. In this report, the AEC indicated that the
fast reactor concept would be the main approach to
developing breeders, However, since that time, technolog-
ical developments have occurred which indicate that
breeding may also be feasible in certain types of thermal
reactors using the thorium fuel cycle. This would
represent a major advance in our reactor technology, since
it provides an alternate approach to the fast breeder
reactor, It would be an important milestone in the
national objective of conserving our fuel resources.”

b. FY 1966 Budget.

"The AEC's civilian power reactor program represents a
plammed research and development effort designed to intro-
duce a new energy source into the national economy. The
ultimate objective of this program is the development of
high-gain breeder reactors to meet the Nation's long-term
energy needs, The basic guidelines to be followed in this
development effort were stated in the AEC's November 1962
report to the President, the basic conclusions and
recommendations of which the committee continues to
endorse as a national policy for the development of civilian
nuclear power."

c. FY 1967 Budget.

"The civilian nuclear power program is presently proceeding
in accordance with guidelines expressed in the Atomic Energy
Commission's November 1962 report to the President, This
report has provided the program with sound objectives for
attainment of a virtually limitless supply of energy for
this country. However, the committee believes that
developments, particularly those in the past year,

84

 

 
d.

warrant a general updating of the program presented in this
report, The committee urges this review because of the
sharply increased rate of addition of nuclear generating
capacity, changes in estimates of future growth of nuclear
power, the more recent technical developments which have
taken place in certain of the advanced reactor fields,

and the latest information which has been developed
concerning our uranium resources." :

FY 1968 Budget.

YA very significant point has been reached concerning test
facilities for the fast breeder program, The proposed

Fast Flux Test Pacility (FFTF), for which the committee

has recommended authorization of $80 million in construction
funds beyond the previously authorized $7.5 million for
architect-engineering, 1s aimed at providing critically
needed test facilities for the sodium cooled fast breeder
program, In light of the complexity of this facility, test
results from it are not expected until about 1975. The
next major decision in the fast breeder program concerns the
plan for construction of demonstration fast breeder reactor
power-plants, The Commission in its testimony stated a
belief that such plants could be started as early as 1970.
The committee intends to follow the planning and scheduling
of this important phase of the program closely."

FY 1969 Budget,

"As the Commission's highest priority civilian nuclear reactor
program, the liquid metal fast breeder reactor (LMFBR) program
is rapidly becoming a model for coordinated, long-range

Statements* Regarding Corporate Commitments
of Major Reactor Manufacturers to LMFBR

North American Rockwell Corporation

"orth American Rockwell is committed as a matter of corporate
policy to becoming a supplier of fast breeder reactor power
plants to the utility industry. Beyond the integrated invest-
ment in facilities and equipment at Atomics International, the
corporation has invested to date $7 million in conceptual
design and $1.9 million in capital facilities and equipment

to support the design of a 500 Me fast breeder plant intended
for construction on the Penelec system under the AEC demonstra-
tion plant program. The demonstration plant is a key objective
in the corporation's plan to supply FBR's to the utility
industry. The company investment during this fiscal year
(October 1967 = September 1968) will be 4.3 million dollars

for design and development and $1.1 million for capital
facilities and equipment.”

The interest and commitment of North American Rockwell was also
stated by Mr, J. L. Atwood, President and Chief Executive Officer
of North American Rockwell, in remarks before the Commission on
January 8, 1968 during a presentation on the AI/GPU program. A
portion of that statement is quoted here.

"North American Rockwell is prepared to commit the management
and financial resources required over the next ten years to
demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility of the
1iquid metal cooled fast breeder reactor concept. Our
commitment is predicated on anticipated progress in the AEC
Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor Program, successful
development and test in the current NR-GPU program and
appropriate support from the AEC for our demonstration plant
program leading to commercial operation in 1976."

General Electric Company

"It is a matter of record that General Electric Company is
committed as a point of corporate policy to develop and
demonstrate the successful operation of the IMFBR in the
electric utility industry on a true scale, consistent with
the commercial availability of plutonium from the thermal
reactor systems, : Cra fn

"With the door thus effectively closed on early development
of a steam cooled fast reactor, General Electric has taken
the position that it will concentrate its technical resources
on meeting the date of 1980 with the liquid metal fast
breeder reactor. .

"On September 5, 1967 General Electric entered into a contract
with the Empire State Atomic Development Associates for a $5
million research and development program, whose stated
objective 1s to develop information which will significantly
strengthen the basis for a demonstration plant commitment in
1969-1970. General Electric has undertaken to submit to
ESADA not later than September 30, 1969, provided that it ia
technically feasible and safe to proceed, an offer to supply a
sodium cooled fast breeder nuclear power plant with a design
target output of approximately 300 MJ. Although it is claar
that implementation of this agreement depends on the prior
successful operation of the SEFOR reactor, and on General
Electric's assessment of the state of development of the sodium
cooled fast breeder technology generally (which obviously
depends in large part on he results from current AEC LMFBR
programs), it is also clear that such an undertaking with some
of General Electric's major customers represents a serious
statement of intent." ‘

Westinghouse Electric Corporation

Westinghouse "has committed $50 million for facilities and
development’ in the fast reactor area. 'In addition, more
than $10 million in facilities are in place and more under
construction,”

"We have also joined 22 utilities and one consultant engineer
to participate in our work to lead toward a demonstration plant,

“To support this approach, Westinghouse has committed more of
its resources, including capital, to breeder development than
to any other single technological development. The Westinghouse
approach is a three-phase program leading to construction of

a sodium-cooled fast breeder reactor. This demonstration
plant, with a rating of 200 to 400 megawatts, will be the
prototype design for a full-scale 1000-MW plant. The program's
first phase, which will continue until 1970, encompasses the
study and research needed to commit the demonstration plant to
detailed design; the second phase is plant construction,
expected to take about five years; in the final phase, the
plant will be operated to optimize the design and determine the
technological and economic feasibility of the full-scale fast
breeder plant,

“This development program can be successful only if it receives
the active support of both the utility industry and the Atomic
Energy Commission, The first phase of the program, already
underway, is receiving financial support from several utilities,
some of which may also provide manpower. A number of other
utility companies, along with the Atomic Energy Commission, have
been invited to join the first phase, Similar cooperation will
be required to complete the second and third phases.

"As a part of the Westinghouse commitment, the facilities of
the Advanced Reactors Division are undergoing a five million
dollar expansion program, The building expansion, due for
completion in early 1969, will provide administration and
engineering offices, high and low bay testing and analytical
laboratories, machine and instrument shops, and other
migcellaneous support facilities for design, experimentation
and testing in the areas of:

Plant Systems and Components Development
Reactor Mechanical Development

Fuels and Materials Development

Sodium Technology"

Babcock & Wilcox Company

"A recent comprehensive evaluation by corporate management
confirmed that substantial amounts of money, personnel and
facilities will continue to be invested in the LMFBR and
other advanced R&D to secure a place in the breeder market
when it develops, The Company has spent millions of dollars
to date in nuclear R&D of which a large portion is directly
and indirectly related to breeder reactor development,
Planned expenditures approximate. $36 million in the next

ten years on breeder reactors alone.

"At this time, the Company is preparing the groundwork for
a joint B&W-utility ILMPBR engineering program, Over thirty
electrical utilities have been presented with background
information as to B&W performance and capability in the
fast breeder field. Discussions are now being held with
certain of these utilities for the purpose of laying the
foundation for the referenced joint venture.

"The proposed association with the utility industry will
provide for active and objective communication between B&W
and the electrical utilities. The information and analysis
developed by this joint venture will provide a sound basis
for the decisions required relative to the construction of
a demonstrator plant," :

Combustion Engineering, Inc.

"The ultimate importance of the fast breeder for the generation
of economic electrical power was recognized some years ago by
Combustion Engineering, and the Company has consistently
promoted this concept as a means to decrease dependence upon
the limited source of low cost uranium ore,

"We are, consequently, pursuing the development of a sodium-
cooled fast breeder with a core geometry optimized for economics
using sodium-bonded carbide fuel. We expect that this development
will take several years, that it will require substantial support
from the USAEC and from the utility industry and that it will
involve the construction of a demonstration plant at an
appropriate time,

"Combustion Engineering is actively engaged in obtaining utilit
support for its research and development program, .

"One utility has given us a letter of intent to support this program.
Several other utilities have expressed considerable interest in the
program, and we expect to receive several more favorable responses.
In addition, there are a number of other utilities we plan to contact
about this program which would ultimately place us in a position to
work on a firm design for a demonstration plant,”

APPENDIX D

 

International Fast Breeder Programs and Implications

In this study the expenditures on the different foreign programs have
not been placed on a comparable basis with those of the U. S. since
accessibility to information on foreign expenditures and budgets is
limited. However, as the attached table. (Table D-1) from the EEI

Fast Breeder Reactor Report* shows, it is estimated that other countries,
excluding the USSR, are spending over $150 million per year on fast
breeder R&D programs, .

The French have spent about $160 million through 1967 on their LMFBR
program, and expect to spend over $100 million more for the Phoenix
Reactor and critical experiments through 1972, Germany has spent $100
million on R&D and, in cooperation with Belgium and the Netherlands,
plans to spend $300 million additional on R&D and prototype design,
$100 million on prototype construction, and $500 million on development
and construction of commercial plant. Most of these expenditures are
on the LMFBR,

It 18 estimated that the Euratom members (German, France, Netherlands,
Belgium, Italy) will have spent at least $2 billion by 1978 on the
LMFBR, including two prototype~and two commercial-scale LMFBR plants,
Attempts are being made by Euratom to consolidate R&D activities of
member countries, and to construct two prototype and only one commercial
Plant, thereby reducing their expenditures,

The United Kingdom has spent about $130 million over the last five
years specifically on the LMFBR,and another $55 million on general
reactor technology, a major share of which is oriented toward the

fast breeder. These expenditures represent about 45% of their reactor
RSD budget. Construction of the LMFBR Prototype Fast Reactor (PFR)

i8 underway, and the total cost is estimated to be $70 million.

The attached table (Table D-2) shows the operational dates of fast
reactors, past and future, in various interested countries. The U.S.
program has been on an extended time scale when compared with other
countries. This approach has been taken for a number of reasons.
However, at this time, continued emphasis and strengthening of the
U. 8. efforts are required to permit this country to establish an
advantageous position in a competitive market,

Substantial sales of light water and breeder reactors will be obtained,
both for the near and far term. with the successful achievement of
the objectives of the U. 8S. reactor programs. : ;

The development of a commercial LMFBR by United Stated industry can
have a beneficial impact on the United States balance of payments
position. Though the country which is first able to produce an
economic and reliable fast breeder reactor may occupy a strong
position from the standpoint of initially capitalizing on the
available worldwide market for breeder reactors, the domination of

a foreign market will depend on many other factors, These include
price structure, simplicity of plant operation and maintenance, and
reactor characteristics. Several West European countries are
planning to introduce a fast breeder reactor into the commercial
environment in the late 1970's and early 1980's, The U. S. is planning
to commence LMFBR operation in the early 1980's. Substantial sales
of both IWR's and breeders will be gained by the U. S., both for the
near and far term, if the current programs are successfully achieved.

The following simplified calculation provides an indication of the
financial implications of a worldwide free market for nuclear reactors. i
Assuming a parallel introduction of the breeder by the various competing
free world countries in 1984 and electricity demands of the U. S.

equal to the rest of the free world, the total IMFBR demand for the
free world in the 1984-1995 period would equal 640,000 Mie, representing |
about $100.-billion dollars in investment.

of competing not only for the $50 billion domestic market, but also is
in the position of competing in an overseas market of equal size. Each
percent of the overseas market represents about $500 million.

On the basis of the above assumptions, the U., S. industry has the potential
