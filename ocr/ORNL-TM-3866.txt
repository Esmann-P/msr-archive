CORROSION AND MASS TRANSFER CHARACTERISTICS OF NaBF,—NaF (92-8 mole %)
IN HASTELLOY N

J. W. Koger

ABSTRACT

A series of corrosion experiments in thermal convection
and pump loops designed to test thé compatibility of fused
NaBF,—8 mole % NaF with Hastelloy N has shown the extreme
effect of impurities on the system mass transfer. The diffi-

“culty in keeping the melt sufficiently pure was also illus-
trated. Kinetic considerations showed that the mass transfer
process is controlled either by solid-state diffusion or by
the solution rate, depending on the amount of impurities
allowed to enter the salt. The mass transfer behavior is
very similar to that for the Cr-UF, corrosion reaction
(material removal in the hot section and deposition in the
cold section), the differences being that alloy constituents
other than chromium participate in the process and that the
reaction rates are different. Because of these differences,
the effective diffusion rate controlling the hot leg attack
is larger than that obtained in typical diffusion experi-

"ments for chromium in Hastelloy N.

Titanium-modified Hastelloy N with less chromium and
iron shows .a greater resistance to attack in a fluoroborate
salt with 500 ppm oxide impurity than does standard
Hastelloy N. Its corrosion rate is doubled by increasing
the oxide concentration to 1500 ppm. Average corrosion
rates were low for all systems tested.

 

x INTRODUCTION

The successful development and operation of the molten salt reactor
experiment (MSRE) have led to the present program for development of a
molten salt breeder reactor (MSER). In the MSRE the heat transferred
from the fuel salt to the coolant salt was rejected to an air-cooled
radiator. In the MSER a secondary coolant will be required to remove

heat from the fuel in the primary heat exchanger and transport this

~ heat to supercritical steam at quite low temperatures.

 
 

This secondary coolant should have low viscosity and density and

high heat capacity and thermal conductivity to permit use of acceptable

heat exchangers, coolant pumps, and steam generators.

The melting point

must be low enough to meet the heat transfer temperature requirements,

and the vapor pressure must be low at the temperature of operation.

The

salt must also be easily remelted, with no precipitation of high-melting

compounds during cooling.

The coolant must be commercially available in

high purity, and the price should not be prohibitive. In nuclear systems

the coolant must be stable under the radiation that it encounters.

We

also must consider the result of accidental mixing of the coolant fluid

and steam and select a coolant in which the effects of this mixing will

be minimized.

the container materials of the system.

Last but not least, the coolant must be compatible with

It now appears that the best choice for the MSBR secondary coolant

is the eutectic mixture of 8 mole % NaF in NaBF4, with a melting point!

385°C (725°F) as shown in Fig. 1.

The salt is quite inexpensive

an’ appreciable rate just above 200°C. Under the conditions of those
experiments, BF; did not appreciably attack a wide variety of metals or

alloys examined at temperatures up to 200°C.

All metal components of the MSRE in contact with molten salt were
made of Hastelloy’ N (formerly called INOR-8). Two decades of corrosion
testing® 1% and experience! ®1% with the MSRE have demonstrated the
excellent compatibility of Hastelloy N and graphite with fluoride salts
containing LiF, BeF,, UF4, and THF. Hastelloy N, perhaps with some
modification of composition, 1s quite likely to be the primary contain-
ment material for MSBR. Thus, it was of great interest to the molten

salt program to determine the compatibility of the fluoroborate salt

mixture with Hastelloy N and related alloys. Of special interest is

“temperature-gradient mass transfer, which must always be considered

where corrosion in a heat exchanger is possible. Corrosion and deposi-

tion processes in flowing nonisothermal systems are interdependent, and

‘each exerts considerable influence over the extent ‘and characteristics

of the other. ‘Therefore, a performance analysis of a nonisothermal
system must consider these processes as complementary and equal in sig-
nificance to the overall system behavior. This paper is an up-to-date,

open-ended report on these studies.

base: alloy: containing 16% Mo, 7% Cr, 5% Fe, and 0.057% c.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

Equipment

In corrosion studies the thermal convection loop represents an
intermediate stage of sophistication and complexity between simple
capsule tests and a full-scale engineering pump loop experiment. It
is particularly suited to small~scale tests that involve temperature

gradient mass transfer. The flow of the liquid is ‘caused by its varia-

tion in density with temperature. The development of a modified thermal

convection loop has permitted important strides in obtaining basic corro-

sion information. The thermal convection loop used in this work and

shown in Fig. 2 permits unrestricted access to specimens and salt at

any time without significantly disturbing loop operation or introducing

air contamination. Access is provided by twin ball valve arrangements
atop both the hot and cold legs of the loops. The molten salt sampling

device illustrated in Fig. 3 was used in our thermal loops and can also

are shown in Fig. 4.

A forced convection loop was also used to evaluate the fluoroborate

salt mixture and will be described later.

Salt Preparation

The salt for these tests was processed by the Fluoride Processing
Group of the Reactor Chemistry Division. Very pure (> 99.9%) starting
materials were evacuated to about 380 torr, heated to 150°C in a vessel

lined with nickel, and then held for about 15 hr under these conditions.

If the rise in pressure was not excessive (indicating no volatile impur-
ities), the salt was heated to 500°C while still under vacuum and agitated
for a few hours with bubbling helium. It was then transferred to the fill
vessel and from it forced into the loops with helium pressure. In the
case of the pumped loop the salt was transferred initially into a dump
tank and then into the loop tubing.

~ The hot portion of each thermal convection loop was heated by sets
of clamshell heaters, with the input power controlled by silicon controlled
rectifiers (SCR units) and the temperature controlled by a Leeds and
Northrup Speedomax H series 60 type CAT controller. The loop tempera-
tures were measured by Chromel-P vs Alumel thermocouples spot welded to
the outside of the tubing, covered first by quartz tape and then by stain-
less steel shim stock.

“Each loop was degreased with ethyl alcohol, heated to 150°C under

vacuum to remove moisture, and leak checked before filling with salt.
All lines from the fill tank to the loop that were exposed to the fluo-
roborate salt were of the same material as the loop and were cleaned and
tested in the same manner as the loop. All temporary line connections
were made with stainless steel compression fittings.

Each loop was filled by heating it, the salt pot, and all connecting
lines to at least 530°C and applying helium pressure to the salt pot to
force the salt into the loop. Air was continuously blown on the freeze
valves leading to the dump and flush tanks to provide a positive salt

seal. Tubular electric: heaters controlled by variable autotransformers

heated the cold-leg ‘portions. Once the loop was filled the heaters were

turned off, and the proper temperature difference was obtained by removing
some insulation to.expose portions of the cold leg to ambient air.

The first charge of salt was circulated under a small temperature
difference (20°C) for 24 hr and dumped. This flush removed surface
oxides and other possible impurities. The loops were then refilled with
new salt and put into operation. A helium cover gas under slight posi-

tive pressure (about 5 psig) was maintained over the salt in the loops

~ during operation.

"Analyses

Several methods can be used to obtain quantitative data from a
temperature-gradient mass transfer experiment relating. to the kinetics
of mass transfer, the. thermodynamics of the process, or both. The most
obvious and easiest to obtain are weight change measurements on specimens
and liquid analyses. The weight changes allow the calculation of mass
transfer rates in both legs, We may also analyze specimens and loop
tubing with a microprobe to determine composition gradients, x-ray
fluorescence to determine the surface composition, and spectrochemistry
to determine overall composition. | Standard metallographic examination
is also’ helpful ‘to determine the extent of attack of void formation in

the hot leg or the amount of deposit in the cold leg.

mal convection loops and ‘in a ‘series of capsule tests have already been

of 605°C maximum temperature and a. temperature difference of 145°C.  .

These operating conditions were those proposed for. the coolant circuit

above conditions was 7 ft/min. Loop NCL-13 contained standard Hastelloy N
specimens, while loop NCL-14 had titanium-modified Hastelloy N suspended

in the salt stream. The compositions of these alloys are given in

Table 2. The modified alloy is being considered because of its superior

mechanical properties under radiation at elevated temperature.

The weight changes measured for the specimens in NCL-13 and NCL-14
showed an increase in mass transfer rate between 3500 and 4300 hr of
exposure to the salt (Fig. 5). This was accompanied by perturbations in
salt composition. Analyses of the circulating salts from these loops
showed that the oxide content increased to above 2000 ppm (from initially
less than 1000 ppm), and the nickel and molybdenum contents exceeded
100 ppm (from below 25 ppm). Also, the chromium and iron contents
increased "normally" with time, as shown in Fig. 6.

After 4700 hr of operation, the helium gas regulator that provided
the overpressure to NCL-13 failed and caused a surge of gas to the loop,
stopping the salt flow. Circulation of the salt could not be resumed
until a vacuum was pulled on the loop, which we believe removed a gas
pocket. Shortly after circulation was restored, an electrical short,
which eventually burned out a heater, occurred and heated the bottom of
the hot leg to 870°C (1600°F) . This disrupted the flow and caused a
loss of BF; from the loop, which changed the salt composition and plugged
all the gas lines. The loop was drained of all salt, and plugged lines
were replaced or unplugged. Other necessary repairs to the loop were
made, and the loop was filled with new salt. The loop was then designated
as NCL-13A. | |

After new fluoroborate salt was added to loop NCL-13A, circulation
could not be achieved. We concluded that previous overheating of the
loop had caused BF3 to evolve and had made the salt much richer in NaF.
This in turn caused the higher melting NaF to segregate in the loop. To
bring the composition back to normal, we added BF; gas to the melt through
the surge tank. The initial amounts of gas were dissolved in the salt,

and additions continued until a slight overpressure built up over the

salt. (No devices were available to measure the amount of BF; gas added.)

- Circulation of the salt was then attempted and was successful. Only a

small temperature difference (55°C) was obtained at first. Further addi-
tions of BF; as before lowered the temperature of the salt in the cold
leg and increased the temperature difference to about 125°C. Since more
BF; did not cause immediate changes and did not appear to dissolve in

the salt, the additions of gas were stopped. The loop has since operated

satisfactorily.

Loops NCL-13A and NCL-14 have now operated for two and three years,

respectively. Figure 7 gives the weight changes of specimens at various

temperatures as functions of operating time. The overall corrosion rates

at the maximum temperature, 605°C, are 0.5 and 0.7 mil/year for loops

NCL-13A and NCL-14, respectively. The attack is general, and actual

measurements of specimens show changes in thickness agreeing with those
calculated from weight changes. We will now discuss the circumstances

‘that have affected the mass transfer conditions.

The air leaks in loops NCL-13A and NCL-14 occurred at various mechan-
ical joints in the system, such as ball valves, level probes, and pressure
gages, all located in the cover gas space above the circulating salt. We
had gained extensive experience with similar mechanical joints before
testing fluoroborate salt mixtures and had encountered no leakage problems.
Therefore, the frequency of leaks in these two fluoroborate loops strongly
suggests that the BF; atmosphere in these tests has deteriorated our
mechanical seals. We are currently investigating the chemical nature of
the BF; to determine any possible contaminants which might have caused
such deterioration. Despite the known problems of air leakage, these
loops have operated for over two years with the fluoroborate salt, and

the overall corrosion rate is within acceptable limits.

We also used loop NCL-14 to determine the corrosion properties of
pure Cr, Fe, Mo, and Nickel 280 (commercially pure nickel with A1l,03
added as a grain refiner) at 600°C in the fluoroborate mixture. As a
consequence of the air leaks discussed above, the oxide content of the
salt in loop NCL-14 was at an abnormally high level and indicated fairly
strongly oxidizing conditions. We initially examined the pure metal
specimens after a 234~hr exposure. On removal, we found that the chro-
mium and iron specimens had completely disintegrated. The molybdenum
specimen showed no weight change, and the nickel specimen showed a
slight weight gain. The chromium and iron specimens were replaced, and
a second experiment was conducted for 23 hr. Again, the molybdenum
specimen did not change weight, and the nickel specimen showed a slight
weight gain. Very little of the chromium specimen remained, and the
weight loss of the iron specimen was 40 mg/cm? (70 mils/year). Close
‘examination of the chromium specimen showed it to be coated with a black
reaction layer about 0.015 in. thick. Laser spectroscopy of the outer
surface of the black material showed iron and boron as major constituents
and sodium and chromium as minor constituents. However, x-ray diffrac-
tion of the bulk coating showed it to be over 90% NaBF,. This black
coating has been observed on Hastelloy N specimens exposed to impure
NaBF4+—8 mole % NaF in the past, 2? but in these cases it was too thin or
too adherent to remove and identify.

Attack of Hastelloy N by impure fluoroborate salt tends to be non-
selective; that is, all components of Hastelloy N suffer oxidation, and
surfaces of the alloy appear to recede uniformly. However, in this
experiment with pure metals, only the chromium and iron were noticeably
attacked, the chromium more than iron. We conclude, therefore, that
the pure chromium and iron specimens in this system inhibited the attack
of the nickel and molybdenum specimens, The inhibition apparently is
much less when chromium and iron are present as alloying additions in
Hastelloy N, presumably because their chemical activity in the alloy is
too low or the rate at which.they can enter the salt is too slow,

being limited by solid-state diffusion in the alloy. When the

oxidation potential of the salt is reduced, however; as would be the

case in a purer fluoroborate salt, attack of Hastelloy N ‘becomes more

selective, and the buffering effect of chromium may become. ‘more impor-

tant. In loop tests of nickel-molybdenum alloys containing Fe, Nb, or

- W, DeVan observed?? that the concentration of these elements in FLINAR2*

salt was lowered by the presence of chromium in the alloy. These obser-

~ vations suggest that the incorporation of an active metal such as chro-

mium would effectively inhibit attack in a Hastelloy N-fluoroborate
circuit.

Figure 8 shows optical and scanning electron micrographs of speci-
mens from the hot and cold leg of NCL-13. These specimens were exposed
to NaBF,—8 mole % NaF for 4180 hr at 580 and 476°C. The hot-leg specimen
lost -3.3 mg/cm?, and the cold-leg specimen gained. 3.2 mg/cm?. The sur-
face of the hot-leg specimen, as seen in Fig. 8 (left) has been attacked
nonuniformly and is heavily contoured. Figure 8 (right) shows that the

_ cold-leg specimen is coated with a discontinuous deposit, which is essen-

‘tially analyzed as Hastelloy N slightly enriched in nickel and molybdenum.

"The dumped salt from NCL-13 was chemically analyzed, and the results
are given in Table 3. The Cr, Fe, Ni, Mo, O, and H,0 contents of the

salt all showed large increases. Increases in the nickel and molybdenum

content of the salt often indicate the onset of stronger oxidizing con-

ditions, usually due to increased water or oxygen content. Thus the

most obvious explanation of the composition changes and increased weight

changes was contamination by water, which produced HF, which in turn

attacked all the constituents of the container material. This was sub-

stantiated by the discovery of a faulty helium line common to both loops.

This line admitted air.

Loop NCL-14 initially operated about 3500 hr with the oxide content

in the salt between 500 and 1000 ppm. During that period the weight

changes were small and predictable as a function of time, Wet air then

came in contact with the salt through the defective gas line, and the
water content and corrosion rate increased dramatically. During the
next 5000 hr the oxide content of ‘the salt decreased, and the corrosion
rate again decreased as a function of time. The maximum rate of weight
loss during this 5000-hr period was about 1.5 x 107% mg cm™? hr”!

(0.65 mil/year). This corrosion rate is double that measured during the
earlier operating period.

. The concentration of impurities in the salt in loop NCL-14 is given
as a function of operating time in Fig. 9. The second change in corrosion
rate, at some time between 11,000 and 13,000 hr, was due to a leaking
standpipe ball valve. This last intake of impurities illustrates a con-
tinuing problem of detection (other than the obvious after-the-fact
increase of impurities and corrosion rate), since the loop overpressure
did not change significantly. Apparently moisture from the air effuses
into the relatively moisture-free atmosphere of the loop (equalization oo

of partial pressure) without the need for a gradient in overall pressure.

In this last corrosion rate increase period the analyzed oxide content of

the salt increased from 1300 to 4500 ppm. The ball valve was repaired,

and the loop continued to operate.

As we have shown, abrupt increases in the slope of the weight change

curves (increased rates of gain and loss) indicated changes in the oxida-

tion potential of the salt, which were caused by inadvertent air leaks

into the system. These slope changes were accompanied by increases in

Cr, Ni, Fe, and Mo contents in the salt, which would indicate general
attack of the alloy. Under conditions where. external impurities did not

- Loop NCL-17

Loop NCL-17, constructed of commercial Hastelloy N with removable
specimens in each leg, is being operated to determine the effect of steam
inleakage in a fluoroborate salt-Hastelloy N circuit. The maximum tem-
perature is 607°C with a temperature difference of 107°C. This experiment
has run for over 10, 000 hr and is continuing in order to provide informa-
tion on the immediate and long-range corrosion of the system after steam
injection. The loop was operated for 1050 hr, the specimens were removed

and weighed, and steam was forced into the flowing salt system through a

16-mil hole in a closed 1/4-in. Hastelloy N tube, simulating a leaking
heat exchanger. Steam was forced .into the system until the pressure of
the cover gas began to increase, thus indicating: that no more steam was
soluble in the salt. Figure 10 shows the weight changes and temperatures
for the specimens in NCL-17. As usual, the changes depend on temperature,
and the rates decrease with time after an initial rapid rate. The corro-
sion rate appears to have stabilized, and no plugging conditions have
been noted. Figure 11 shows the specimens from the loop 424 hr after
exposure to steam. The specimens with the etched appearance have lost
weight, and those that are darkened have gained weight.

For the last 3500 hr of operation, as shown in Table 4, the concen-
trations of impurity constituents in the salt (Fe, Cr, Ni, Mo, and 0)
remained relatively constant. The present chromium level is about

320 ppm. The results of this test show that the Hastelloy N system

the leak is repaired, can continue to operate without extensive damage
even if the salt is not repurified. 3

Figure 12 shows micrographs of the specimens in the hottest and
coldest positions. “The attack seen in the hot leg is general, as
expected for impurity-controlled mass transfer processes. ‘Micrometer
measurements show a loss of about 1 mil from specimen surfaces at the
maximum temperature position. In Fig. 12(b) we see a large amount (about
2 mils) of deposited material, This material has been analyzed with
an electron beam microprobe, and Table 5 gives the results for the sub-

strate and the deposit. These results show that very little chromium

‘has deposited. The nickel and molybdenum concentrations reached maxima

of 74 and 56 ppm, respectively, 288 hr after the steam addition, decreased,
and quickly leveled off to about 10 .ppm each. From the microprobe evi-
dence much of the nickel and molybdenum apparently deposited in the cold
leg, although not in the same ratio as they exist in Hastelloy N. , One

may conclude that ‘under: highly oxidizing conditions, during which. large
weight changes occur (NCL-14 during ‘the air leak and 'NCL-17 after ‘steam

inleakage), most of the changes are attributable to the movement of the

Loop NCL-20

In loop NCL-20, cbfidtructed of standard” Histelloy N with removable
specimens in each leg, the fluoroborate coolant salt has circulated for
12,000 hr. The salt used was especially pure (see Table 6). The loop
is being operated at temperature conditions very near those proposed for
the maximum (687°C) and minimum (387°C) salt-metal temperature (primary
heat exchanger and steam generator, respectively) of the MSBR secondary
circuit. Forced air cooling (as opposed to ambient air cooling used on
other thermal-convection loops) is used on the lower half of the cold
leg, and the practical operating temperatures obtained were 687°C maxi-
mum and about 437°C minimum: a temperature difference of 250°C. This
difference is thought to be the largest obtained at ORNL in a molten-salt
thermal-convection loop, and the maximum temperature is the highest for
fluoroborate salt in a loop. Table 6 gives the corrosion results for
this experiment. The corrosion rates are the lowest yet attained with a
fluoroborate mixture and confirm the importance of salt purity on com-
patibility with structural materials. The low concentrations of chromium

and oxide in the salt are also indicative of low corrosion rates.

~ Figure 14 shows weight changes of the specimens as functions of time and

temperature.

FCL~1 Pump Loop

The MSR-FCL-1 forced-circulation loop operated for over 11,000 hr
(7 runs) to test the compatibility of standard Hastelloy N with NaBF,—8 mole %
NaF coolant salt at temperatures and flow rates similar to those that
existed in the MSRE coolant circuit. Salt velocity in the 1/2-in.-0D
X 0.042-in.-wall Hastelloy N loop was nominally 10 fps and was limited by
the use of an available pump. The salt in the loop was heated by electri-
cal resistance and cooled by a finned, air-cooled heat exchanger. A
~ schematic of the loop is given in Fig. 15. Figure 16 is a typical tem-
perature profile of the system; this profile was based on a computer plot
of the temperature information from the test loop and on heat transfer
~ calculations that estimate the inner wall temperatures. The maximum and
minimum salt temperatures of the loop are 588 and 510°C. Hastelloy N
corrosion test specimens were exposed to the circulating salt at three
temperatures, 510, 555, and 588°C. A typical set of specimens is shown
schematically in Fig. 17. One of the main drawbacks to this loop was
that the salt had to be drained from the loop and the loop tubing had to

replace the specimens and resulted in a fairly long turnaround time
between runs.

After 659 hr of shakedown operation under various conditions and
the initial 2082 hr of operation at design conditions a bearing failed
in the LFB centrifugal pump. The pump rotary element was removed, and
a new bearing was installed. To take advantage of this unscheduled
downtime, portions of the loop piping and the corrosion specimens were
removed for metallographic examination and weight change measurements.
This first operating period was designated run 1. It was then decided:
that the loop would be shut down each.2000 hr for pump-bearing replace-
ment and specimen examination.

The operating times and corrosion rates for the first five runs are
summarized in Table 7, and Fig. 18 shows the weight changes of .specimens
as measured after each run. The details of each run will be discussed
in the following pages. It is noted that the mass transfer rates were
higher in the pump loop than in thermal-convection loops circulating | -

Figure 19 shows micrographs of specimens from each location after
2082 and 4088 hr (run 2) of design operation. In (a) and (b) it is clear
that the attack at 588°C, the highest salt temperature, occurred primarily
at the intersections of the grain boundaries with the surface. At 555°C,
as the weight changes indicated, much less attack has occurred [(c) and
(d)]. For 510°C, the lowest salt temperature, a metallic deposit is
visible [(e) and (f)] along the surface in the as-polished condition.
This deposit occurs under steady-state conditions and was shown by elec-
tron microprobe analysis to have the approximate composition of Hastelloy N;
no salt-like deposit was observed. Figure 20 shows the surface of the
specimens at 588 and 510°C. Note the smoothness of the surface of the
specimen that has been attacked and the deposit on the specimen in the
cold region.

Samples of loop tubing were periodically removed and examined metal-
lographically for comparison with the weight-change specimens. The
behavior was similar, as shown in Fig. 21. The attack concentrated at
the intersections of the grain boundaries with the surface, and deposits
were seen in the cold region. The tubing had a much smaller grain size
than the specimens; from this one might anticipate a greater corrosion
rate for the tubing. No difference could be seen between tubing exposed
under the heaters and tubing at the same. temperature but not under the
heaters.

Examination of the pump (Fig. 22) and the pump bowl (Fig. 23) did
not disclose any gross contamination; however, small amounts of a green
material were found on the pump bowl at the salt level. After the bowl
was washed with water to remove the salt, very fine, whisker-like, green
crystals were also found in the bottom of the pump bowl (Fig. 24). A
large piece of mixed green material and white salt (< 1 g total weight)
was analyzed and identified; Table 8 shows the composition. These
results are equivalent to 55 wt % NaBF,, 30 wt 7 Na,CrFg, and smaller
amounts of irom, nickel, and molybdenum fluorides. The presence of the
green corrosion product and the level of chromium concentration in the

salt indicate that we reached the saturation concentration of chromium

Installation and Testing of Cold Finger During Run 3

During run 3 a cold-finger corrosion product trap, shown in Fig. 26
and similar in design to one previously used?’ in sodium fluoroborate
test loop PKP-1, was inserted into the salt in the pump bowl in an attempt
to induce preferential deposition of corrosion products from the salt
circulating in the loop. Such deposition had been observed on the cold
finger in loop PKP-~1l. Gross deposition is always possible in a temperature-
gradient system, and we feel that this cold-finger device is a likely com-
ponent to prevent this problem. |

The cold finger used in MSR-FCL-1 is a closed-end nickel cylinder,
1 3/4 in. long x 3/8 in. OD, with a 0.070-in.-thick wall. It is cooled
by an argon-water mixture injected into it and then discharged to the
atmosphere. The metal wall temperature is measured and recorded by two
0.020-in.-0D sheathed, ungrounded Chromel vs Alumel thermocouples inserted
in two 1-in.—-deep axial holes (0.023 in. diam) in the 0.070-in.-thick wall
of the cold finger.

" Eight tests were made in which the cold finger was inserted into
the salt in the pump bowl of the loop and cooled to temperatures ranging
from 493 to 140° C, . The duration of the tests ranged from 1.5 to 5.3 hr.
The temperature of the salt in the pump bowl was 510°C.

‘In contrast to the deposits of material containing NasCrFg, which
had ‘been found?® on a cold finger in PKP-1 loop at metal wall tempera-
tures of 400, 460, and 477° C, no significant deposit of any kind was
séen on the cold- -finger tests in loop MSR-FCL-1. Even in the three
tests where indicated wall temperatures were below the salt liquidus
temperature (385°C), the surface of the cold finger was essentially
clean, as visually observed when it was withdrawn into a sight glass,

Occasionally, small patches (1/8 to 1/4 in. across) of white material,

‘estimated to be a few mils thick, were seen on the surface.

The cold finger was then installed in the PKP-1 fluoroborate loop
-n an attempt to duplicate the previous cold-finger test results of

that loop. The chromium concentration of the fluoroborate salt in loop

‘PKP-1 is about 500 ppm, while that in MSR-FCL-1 is about 250 ppm. Two
“tests were run in which the indicated cold-finger wall temperature was

“about 150°C (salt temperature in the pump bowl was 548°C). Test times

were 1 and 4.5 hr. No deposition on the cold finger was seen after
withdrawal into a sight glass. Tests at higher temperatures were not
made because of temperature control difficulties with the cold finger.
Since the cold finger previously used in the PKP-1 loop contained
grooves on the outside surface, the lower half of the surface of the
MSR-FCL-1 cold finger was scored with file marks about 0. 010 in. deep,
and a third test run at about 150°C lasting 6 1/2 hr was made in the

 PKP-1 loop. ‘In this run a deposit was obtained. Generally, the entire

surface of the cold finger was covered with a vhite deposit, with an

overlay of bright green ‘material on the lower half of the cold finger.
The cold finger was allowed to stand overnight under a helium atmosphere,
and by this time the deposit.had begun to separate from the cold-finger
surface. While the cold finger was moved for photographing, the entire

deposit spalled off, leaving a clean metal surface. The total deposit
weight was 1.63 g, of which 1.26 g was mostly green material (complete
separation was not possible). Chemical analysis of the green material
disclosed 2.93 wt % Cr, 1.03 wt % Fe, 370 ppm Ni, and < 500 ppm Mo, with
the remainder Na, B, and F. Stoichiometric calculations indicated:

11 mole % Na3CrFe, 4 mole % NasFeFg, and the remainder a mixture of.
NaBF and NaF, | | | oo

Subsequent operation of the cold finger at the same conditions in

‘loop MSR-FCL-1 did not produce a deposit. On the basis of these tests
we concluded that a wetting problem exists with the salt and that a

grooved or roughened surface is required to obtain a deposit. -We then

tried various designs to improve adherence of the deposit to the.cold.

finger and to lessen the probability of accidental removal during with-

drawal from the pump bowl.

Run 4

After run 4 when the pump had been removed, we found approximately

50 g of intermixed white and green material on the pump liner above the

liquid level. Analysis of a small portion of this material showed about

equal amounts of NaF and NaBF,, with 4300 ppm Cr, which ve ‘assume to be
in the form of Na;CrFe. We do not know the conditions that caused the
deposition of the corrosion product in the pump liner.

Specimens in the coldest part of the system gained weight during

the first three runs and then lost a small amount of weight during run 4,

Thickness measurements of these specimens disclosed that the upstream
end had reduced in thickness compared with the middle and downstream
end. Specimens at other locations in the loop (555 or 588°C) showed
similar but smaller thickness variations. Figure 27 shows a specimen
at 588°C after run 4 and clearly illustrates the heavier attack at the
upstream end. Changes in specimen thickness are summarized in Table 9,

and they are quite consistent with the changes calculated from weight

measurements.

(9600 hr total exposure to the fluoroborate mixture). The left micro-

Average weight losses of the specimens are 21.3 mg/cm?. Microprobe

0.4 mil into the specimen. This depleted area is represented by the
darkened area extending from the surface for approximately 0.5 mil. The
center micrograph shows the surface of a specimen at 555°C. The average
weight loss of these specimens was 4.6 mg/cm?. Microprobe analysis of
these specimens disclosed only a small concentration gradient for a dis-
tance of 0.1 mil. This follows from the small amount of attack seen on
the specimen. The micrograph to the right shows the deposit on the sur-
face of the specimens at 510°C. The average weight loss of the specimen
is 0.1 mg/cm?, but this overall loss stems from a great deal of corrosion
on the leading edge and is not indicative of the whole specimen. Micro-
probe analysis of this surface showed a large amount of iron and a little
more nickel than usual. This situation existed for a distance of 0.5 mil,
after which the concentrations of both elements approached that of the
matrix. The average deposit is only 0.2 mil thick; thus, it appears that
portions of the deposit have diffused in. Prior evidence in deposit

study had disclosed similar findings.

Run 5

Run 5 was terminated after 422 hr of operation at design conditions
‘when the pump bearings failed. This failure allowed the pump impeller
to contact the impeller housing, abrading the impeller. Metal particles
from the impeller were seen in the salt left in the pump bowl after
dumping. Accordingly, the pump was removed from the loop, and at the
same time we removed the corrosion test specimen assemblies. This
allowed us to clean the loop piping by flushing with demineralized water.
A total of 3.31 g of Hastelloy N particles was recovered from the loop.
The loop was dried by air purging, and the corrosion specimen assemblies
and pump were reinstalled. A nickel filter with 40-pm pores was also
installed in the dump tank line to filter any metal particles from the
salt being returned to the loop.

During the scheduled loop shutdown at the end of run 4, we had
enlarged the access port in the pump bowl from 1/2- to 3/4-in. diam
 

43

(maximum size possible in the pump bowl) to provide more flexibility in
the design and operation of cold-finger devices. With the enlarged
access port we were able to insert a 5/8-in.-OD cold finger with circum-
ferential grooves that had been previously used in another circulating
fluoroborate loop (PKP-1) and on which significant deposits of salt con-
taining NasCrFe had been obtained.

Several tests were made during run 5. with this cold finger at tem-
peraturés between 150 and 420°C. The cold finger was inserted below the
liquid surface in the pump bowl for periods of 5 to 6 hr for each test.
The salt temperature in the pump bowl was approximately 516°C. Small
deposits with a light-green color (indication of corrosion product
Na3CrFg) were occasionally seen on the cold finger when it was withdrawn
into the sight glass above the pump bowl. However, such deposits usually
dropped off immediately. Apparently any slight vibration is enough to

knock most of the deposited material loose before the cold finger can be

' .pulled all the way out of the pump bowl.

The weight changes of Hastelloy N specimens in loop MSR-FCL-1 are
compared in Table 7 for each of five test runs. The corrosion rate
decreased steadily over the first four runs and, at the conclusion of
run 4, had dropped to 0.3 mil/hr at the point of maximum temperature
(588°C). However, the corrosion rate during run 5 was higher than in
any of the preceding runs.

Although the increased rate of attack during run 5 is undoubtedly
associated with operating difficulties encountered during the run, we
have not pinpointed. the specific causes. Increased corrosion is normally
accompanied by an increase in impurities in the salt; however, we did
not see any significant impurity changes during run 5. Because of the
nature of the last pump-bearing failure, we were not able to take a salt
sample from the loop before shutdown in our normal manner. Thus a sample
was taken from the dump tank after the loop had been shut down. However,
because of dilution there was no assurance that the sample was represen-—
tative of the salt that had circulated in the loop.

oxidizing conditions had been created by intentional steam inleakage and

large amounts of mass ‘transfer had occurred.

Run 6

The sixth run was abruptly terminated after 1241 hr, when oil from
a broken pump cooling oil line ignited on contact with the pump bowl and
adjacent piping. We extinguished the fire and turned off all loop
heaters, which allowed the salt to freeze in the loop piping. Figure 30
shows the pump bowl and pump with no apparent damage after the fire.
The material in the beaker is salt and corrosion products left in the
pump bowl,

‘We replaced the electrical wiring, thermocouples, and service

piping necessary to melt the salt in the loop piping and transfer it to

the drain tank. This was the first time that we had attempted to melt

salt in the entire loop circuit, although salt had been melted in the

cooling coil without difficulty on several occasions. Normally when

the loop is placed in standby condition, the salt circulation is stopped,

the main loop heaters are turned off, and sufficient heat is supplied

to the loop to maintain the loop circuit above the salt liquidus tem-

perature, 385°C. During the attempted melting, the main loop piping

(1/2-in.-0D x 0.042-in.-wall Hastelloy N) ruptured at a point near the
U-bend in the loop and adjacent to one of the metallurgical specimen
holders, as shown in Fig. 31. After the rupture, we froze the salt in
the loop as quickly as possible by turning off all loop heaters. How-
ever, approximately 77 g salt was lost from the loop. Before the rupture
the salt in the bowl and cooling coil section of the main loop had been
melted without difficulty, the main loop piping had reached temperatures
varying between 371 and 482°C around the loop circuit, and the drain

line temperatures were above 426°C.

In reviewing the loop melting procedure to determine the cause of
the rupture, we concluded that uneven thicknesses of thermal insulation
caused considerable variation in the temperatures. In particular, the
temperatures under the clamshell emergency heaters (where the thermal
insulation was about 1 in. thick, compared to about 2 in. on the remainder
of the tubing) were about 80°C below temperatures in the more heavily
insulated sections of tubing. Thus, the salt in the ruptured area melted
but was not able to expand properly because of frozen salt plugs under
the emergency heaters. Another problem was the difficulty in controlling
the rate of heatup of the main loop by resistance heating. Even though

‘the lowest setting on the loop heater was used, we still had to turn off

the heater supply power for short periods to maintain temperature control.

We removed -the metallurgical specimen assembly and ruptured section

of tube and replaced it with new tubing. Figure 32 shows the ruptured

section of tubing. Measurements of the outside diameter of the remaining
loop tubing were made and compared with the original outside diameter to

determine if excessive permanent strain had occurred at other locatioms.

Generally all measurements were in the range of 0.500 to 0.505 in., as
compared to the original diameter of 0.500 in.

The tubing that surrounded the specimens was removed after run 6
(11,371 hr) and examined by both optical metallography and scanning
electron microscopy. Figure 33 shows the tubing exposed to salt at 588
and 555°C. In the optical micrograph of Fig. 33(a) the surface roughening
(some salt is still in place) can be seen, and the attack at the grain
boundaries is noted. In the scanning electron micrograph we can see the
delineation of the grains. Figure 33(b) shows much less attack at 555°C.
Figure 34 shows the tubing downstream of the cooler in the coldest posi-
tion (510°C) of the loop. The deposit is easily seen in the optical
micrograph and is seen in the scanning micrograph to be in the form of
nodules. The upper portion of Fig. 34(c) shows a side view of the nodu-
lar deposits.

After the oil fire that ended run 6 and the subsequent rupture of
the tubing during the attempt to melt the salt from the loop, the corro-
sion specimens were removed, weighed, and examined. Surprisingly, weight
was lost by all specimens. The weight loss rates found for specimens
exposed to the salt at 588 and 555°C were (assuming uniform losses) about
1.9 and 0.5 mils/year, respectively, for the 1240 hr of run 6. The corro-
sion rate ratio for these specimens (several times greater loss at 588°C
than at 555°C) was fairly consistent with past findings. "However, in
earlier runs, specimens at 510°C had gained weight. For this time period

specimens at this temperature level lost material at the rate of 1.9 mils/year,

the same as for specimens at 588°C. This weight loss anomaly and the

overall higher weight losses are attributed to the problems encountered
during this run and probably attest to a local high temperature in the
colder section along with oxidizing impurities in the salt. A salt

analysis showed small increases in chromium, iron, and nickel contents,

all of which reflect the increased corrosion rates.

Run 7

After repairs we returned the loop to design conditions for the

start of run 7, circulating the same NaBF,—8 mole Z NaF coolant salt

used since the start of loop operation.

During run 7 while repairs were under way on the loop high-temperature

‘protective instrumentation, an operating error resulted in a portion of .

the loop tubing being’ “hbated above 1100°c. “This caused one failure of
the loop tubing adjacent to one of the electrical power input lugs
(see Fig. 31) and also about 12 in. downstream. Part of the salt in the

loop (about 2 liters) was discharged into the loop secondary containment.

Temperatures were immediately reduced and the facility was shut down.

At about 1100°C the strength of Hastelloy N is very low, and the salt
vapor pressure approaches 1000 psi. The salt boiled locally, and over-
heating could have reduced the tube strength until rupture occurred.
Local melting of the tubing was also evidenced. At the time of failure
the loop had accumulated 10,335 hr of operation at design conditions
(101 hr during run 7). The tube failure is shown in Fig. 35.

Following the rupture of the loop tubing that ended run 7, the
corrosion test specimens were again removed for weighing and metallurgi-
cal examination. The specimens adjacent to the ruptured area (hottest
section under normal conditions, 588°C) were badly warped and partially
fused to the tube wall. Thus, only metallographic analysis was possible.
The specimens in the intermediate zone (555°C) appeared to be unharmed.
The average weight loss for these specimens was 1.3 mg/cm? in the 101 hr
of run 7. Expected loss for these specimens in 100 hr would be approxi-
mately 0.1 mg/cm?. Thus, if we attribute the balance of the corrosion
to just the period of the temperature excursion (to about 1000°C), the loss

rate was 1.2 mg/cm? in 2.5 min or 10,000 mils/year (10 in./year).

Weight losses were also found for the specimens downstream of the
cooler. Although the specimens were adjacent, one specimen lost
0.3 mg/cm? and the other 3.0 mg/cm? ‘Again the severity of the over-
heating was evident. Certainly a large part of these losses nay be
attributed to moisture contamination of the salt and air oxidation
after the loop rupture. Nonetheless, the corrosion rate was quite high.

" "Purification

With the realization .that the fluoroborate salt is easily contami-
nated with oxygen and water-type impurities and that corrosion increases

with the amount of these impurities, we have attempted, in close coopera-

tion with R. F. Apple and A. S. Meyer, of the Analytical Chemistry
Division, to purify the fluoroborate in a manner that could be adapted

to a large system.

| In the method that gave favorable results, a mixture of He, BFj,
and HF (purified with fluorine) was passed through the fluoroborate at
454°C. A schematic of the process is given in Fig. 36. The gas mixture
was passed for 15 hr into a Hastelloy N vessel containing the impure
(about -2000 ppm H;0) fluoroborate salt (2.7 kg) at 480°C. The exit gas
entered a solution ‘of 10 vol % pyridine in methyl alcohol. At the com-

“pletion of the purification process titration of this solution with
“Karl Fischer reagent to the dead-stop end point indicated that about

600 ppm -H20 was removed. Chemical analysis disclosed that the oxygen
content décreased from 1700 to 1400 ppm and ‘that the H,0 content changed

from 2000 to 300 ppm. Changes in the BF; content of the salt appeared
to be minimal. Further work is planned using a nickel vessel to elimi-

nate corrosion products resulting from the reaction of HF with Hastelloy N.

Analytical Chemistry

Over the last few years, we have been concerned over the behavior
of water in molten fluoride salts. Water in these salts has implications
for both corrosion and tritium removal. In corrosion work, we have long
recognized the need for analyses that would allow us to distinguish
between water and (1) compounds that contain 1’ ions, (2) compounds
which contain 0% ions, and (3) HF (highly corrosive). In the past, a
complementary indication of mass transfer (besides weight changes and
metal analysis of the salt) was the analysis for Hz0 and 0; in the salt.
On the basis of our tritium injection experiment?’ and work in the
Analytical Chemistry and Reactor Chemistry Divisions, we now feel that
the results of the water determinations included many other constituents
of the salts, including oxides. Thus, a result indicating a large amount
of water really only showed a corresponding amount of oxide. The lack
of water in the salt is completely reasonable because all the hydrogen

in impurity compounds that enter the salt would eventually cause oxida-
tion of the metal wall and would in turn be reduced to hydrogen gas,

. which would diffuse out of the loop (the corrosion equations will be
discussed later). However, increased mass transfer (weight losses and
‘gains by specimens) by virtue of water impurity is still accompanied by
an increase in the oxide content of the salt. Thus, the oxide content

is still somewhat indicative of the mass transfer of the loop system.
DISCUSSION

Theory

Metal corrosion by salt mixtures consists of oxidation of metal

constituents to their fluorides, which are soluble in the melt and hence

do not form a protective film. This electrochemical-type attack is

therefore limited only by the thermodynamic potential for the oxidation
reaction and is selective, removing the least noble constituent, which
. in the case of Hastelloy N is chromium. Possible corrosion reactions

involving impurities in the melt may be written as

2HF + Cr = H, + CrF,,
NiF, + Cr = Ni + CrF,,
FeF, + Cr == Ni + CrF,.

Although the reaction product is written as CrF,, the actual species in

the melt is unknown. Chromium(II) is possibly unstable in the fluoroborate
melt, since the only corrosion product isolated and identified is Na3CrFe.

-In an isothermal system, immediately after immersion in the fused
salt system and before thermodynamic equilibrium has been fully estab- : *
lished, the electrode potential of the.metal has a much higher electro-
negative value than the redox potential of the surrounding medium. . As v
a result, reduction of the oxidizer commences. which takes place along.
with the corrosion of the metal. As the corrosion products accumulate
the metal's electrode potential shifts in the positive direction, whereas
the redox potential moves toward the negative side. Equilibrium occurs
when the potentials are equal. Since we are dealing with corrosion in
a nonisothermal system (i. e., a heat exchanger), the mechanism of
interest to us is temperature-gradient mass transfer. A schematic of
this process. is given in Fig. 37. Ina loop ‘that contains salt with
UF, and no corrosion products, all points of the loop initially expe-

rience a loss of chromium by the reaction

2UF, + Cr = CrF2 + 2UF3.

As the corrosion-product concentration in the salt is increased, equi-
librium with respect to the corrosion reaction is eventually reached at
the point of lowest temperature of the system. At regions of higher
temperature, a driving force for the corrosion reaction still exists.
Thus, the corrosion-product concentration will continue to increase and
the equilibrium temperature will begin to increase from the coldest
temperature. At this stage, chromium is returned to the walls of the
coldest point of the system. The rise in corrosion-product concentra-
tion in the circulating salt continues until the amount of chromium
returning to the walls exactly balances the amount of chromium entering
the system in the hot-leg regions in the same interval. Under these
conditions, the two positions of the loop at equilibrium with the salt,
which are termed the "balance points," do not shift measurably with time.
Thus, a quasi-steady-state situation is eventually achieved, whereby
chromium is transported at very low rates and under conditions of a :
fixed chromium surface concentration at any given loop position. At

this point the chromium removal is controlled by the solid-state diffu- Fo
sion rate of chromium in Hastelloy N. Table 11 illustrates the small . -

There should be very little corrosion of Hastelloy N by pure molten
NaBF, or NaF, such as is seen for LiF or BeF,;; thus we attribute the

mass transfer to other sources. We have shown several examples of

inadvertent air (moisture) inleakage ‘and the concomitant increase in
mass transfer. This was also illustrated in NCL-17, where steam was
added. The corrosion reactions in the sodium fluoroborate salt mixture
have not been well established but can be expected to be reasonably

represented by the following equations:

'H,0 + NaBF, = NaBF30H + HF,
‘ NaBF 30H = NaBOF, + HF,

6HF + 2Cr + 6NaF == 2Na3CrF¢ + 3H; (and similar reactions with
nickel and irom),

FeF, + Cr = CrF; + Fe (and similar reactions with nickel and

"The ‘next result is that.water reacts with sodium fluoroborate to
produce hydrogen fluoride and oxide ions of an oxygen-containing complex
"in the salt. The hydrogen fluoride reacts with the constituents of

Hastelloy N to bring metal ions into solution in the ‘salt and to release
hydrogen. It is not known if the oxide in ‘solution can corrode Hastelloy N,
but ‘oxygen in air can react with Hastelloy N to produce metal oxides.
These metal oxides dissolve in the melt to form metal ions and oxide ions
in solution. Metal ions in solution in the salt react with and displace
less noble constituents of ‘the Hastelloy N. Highly oxidizing conditions
(presence of HF) can ‘bring all the constituents into. solution. As the
salt becomes less oxidizing the more noble metals in ‘solution react with
less noble alloy constituents until only chromium ions are present in
the salt in important. quantities. This movement of chromium is governed
primarily by the rate. of diffusion of chromium in the Hastelloy N.

Assuming that H,0 (or HF) causes the mass transfer in sodium fluoro-
borate and on the basis that 1 mole of H20 is required to corrode 1 mole
of metal we have calculated the amount of water required to cause. known
amounts of corrosion on several of our systems {Table 12). For NCL-17,
in the 1054-hr operation before steam addition, 41 mg H,0 would have
been required to cause .the 137 mg metal removed, leaving 75 ppm oxide
in the salt. At the end of 10,000 hr. after steam addition 23 g of metal
had been removed. This would have required 6.3 g Ho0 and would have
resulted in 13,800 ppm. oxide in the salt. Since we have never measured
this much oxide in the salt, this material must deposit. The amount
of water required to ‘produce the eotrosion seen in NCL-20 is small but
has continued to increase with time. This can mean several things. One,
there. 1s a constant inleakage in our test systems or, two, there are
impurities present in the salt, which continually cause corrosion. The
first: possibility is quite plausible because we have seen faulty gas
regulators, which can leak undetected for quite a long time. As for the
“second possibility, the Fe + concentration in the’ salt has decreased over
120 ppm, which would result in the removal of only 350 mg of chromium
from the Hastelloy N. This still leaves about 600 mg. that we might

attribute to water-caused corrosion.

This equation describes the mass transfer that can occur in a temperature-

by Evans, Koger, and DeVan.?2®

Of importance is the fact that at the
balance point no material is transported, at temperatures above the
balance point material is transported away, and at temperatures below
the balance point material is brought in. The equation was originally
considered only for diffusion-controlled processes such as the corrosion
reaction between chromium and UF4, but we see in our plots of weight change
versus position that balance points exist even when solid-state diffusion
is not controlling (Figs. 38, 39, 40, and 41). Thus the same mass
transfer theory holds for our impurity-controlled reactions.

The material deposited in the cold leg during the normal operation s
of the loop is metallic, generally nickel and molybdenum. Plugging-
type deposits, usually resulting when the solubility of a metal fluoride
in the salt is exceeded, have been found to be mixed or complex fluorides
such as Na3CrFg, NaFeF3;, NaNiF3;. This report does not include discussions
of condition of saturation of any components. Most of the material
retained in the salt is chromium with some iron, both in the form of
fluorides. |

Kinetics

According to prevailing concepts of reaction mechanisms, a reaction
such as the corrosion of a solid material by a fused salt occurs as a
sequence of steps. The combined effect of these steps determines the

net rate of the reaction. However if, as is common, one step is

significantly slower than the others, the rate of the entire reaction
is governed by the slowest step. |

It is convenient to break up the dissolution process in the hot leg
into four separate steps:

1. diffusion of the attacked elements through the matrix of the alloy
to the surface,

2. migration of the oxidizing species from the salt to the surface,

3. oxidation of the metal to a dissolved fluoride,

4. migration of the oxidized metal to the flowing salt.

In cases where the slow step involves a diffusion process (volume
diffusion in a solid), the reaction is termed diffusion-controlled and
is governed by the laws of diffusion kinetics. Alternately, if a
boundary-region process (solution) constitutes the slow step, the rate

of the overall reaction is determined by the kinetics of that process.

 
 

 

66

The rate of formation of the corrosion product fluoride should be included
in this analysis, but experimental data relating to its formation and
the effect of impurities are lacking.

If the diffusion step is rate controlling, then no velocity effect
" would be seen. However, if step 2 was slowest and was controlling, the
process would be velocity dependent. At a certain critical velocity
(possibly even that of the salt in natural circulation loops), the path
for step 2 would become short and step 3 would control. Above this
critical velocity, no velocity dependence would again be seen. Step 4,
like step 2, would be velocity dependent. Thus, experiments in systems
with different salt velocities could help to determine the rate-controlling
mechanism.

In this work, we will consider the possibilities of solid-state

diffusion and solution control.

"Solid-State Diffusion Control

A form of Fick's second law can be used for the weight loss in this

case
W = AC /Dt , (4)

where

W = weight change,

C = concentration change of diffusing substance,

D = solid state diffusion coefficient,

t = time,

A = constant.

If Eq. (4) applies, b of Eq. (1) is theoretically equal to 1/2.
The diffusion coefficient follows the Arrhenius relationship

.D = D, exp(Dg/RT) , | (5)

where
D, is constant and

Dg is the effective activation energy for diffusion in the alloy.

If we differentiate Eq. (4) and substitute Eq. (5) for D, we obtain

in the process since the material which is to be removed is already at
the surface. Thus, step 2, 3, or 4 might be controlling. After the
initial fast portion of the reaction the ‘corrosion rate generally levels
out. At this time, the diffusion of ‘the elements to the surface would
control. Thus, the calculated overall rate would appear to be of
mixed control. When a velocity effect is noted, as 1s thought to occur
in MSR-FCL-1, then it can be assumed that enough impurities are controlling
the corrosion reactions to cause solution rate control of the entire
process. | oo
Although the proposed corrosion mechanisms are usually First considered

for material removal, they may also be used for the deposition in the

cold leg of the system. The temperature dependence is reversed, the
largest deposition occurs at the highest temperature, which causes a
change in sign of the activation energy. Table 14 gives the experimental
values of Q and b for the systems which gained weight. The kinetic
constants of one group, titanium-modified alloy and fluoroborate.salt with
1500 ppm oxide, corresponds to solid-state diffusion control, but the -

value of the others are in mixed agreement.

‘Diffusion Calculations

Weight change rate constants based on diffusion control were cal-
culated for loops NCL-13 and NCL-14 after 2500 hr with the following

equation:
= + °
AW oes C v/4pt/m, T > 520 + 15°C ,
where
C = concentration of Fe + Cr in Hastelloy N, g/cm?,
D = diffusion coefficient, cm?/sec,
t= time, sec.

By using the weight changes and the combined iron and chromium
concentration for the loop specimens, almost identical D values were
‘obtained for the standard and modified Hastelloy N. This is quite
significant, since the iron content of titanium-modified Hastelloy N
is negligible. Thus D, or in reality a rate constant Ky» is independent
of the concentration of chromium, iron, and other diffusing species.

The weight change, however, is quite sensitive to the total concentration
of the migrating elements. Confirmation of this hypothesis is evident

when Kk, is compared with D, in Hastelloy N. 31232 For loops NCL-13 and

The effect of impurity oxide content in fluoroborate salt on weight

losses of the Hastelloy N alloys at 555 and 604°C is given in Fig. 42.

The data show that titanium-modified alloys lose less weight than the
standard Hastelloy N for exposure in fluoroborate salt containing
500 ppm H»0 impurity at temperatures between 555 and 604°C. However, at

the same temperatures the titanium-modified alloy exposed to fluoroborate
salt containing 1500 ppm oxide shows a greater weight loss than either
alloy exposed to the 500 ppm oxide salt. .

The actual average weight loss rate was calculated for several

alloy-salt combinations and plotted in Fig. 43 against the inverse of

the absolute temperature. . Also included in Fig. 43 are weight loss

rates calculated from

Salts.

For this calculation we assumed Cg = 0, ‘that all weight loss was the removal

of chromium, and that this removal was controlled by ‘the diffusion of
chromium to the surface. The chromium diffusion coefficient®? in
Hastelloy N was used in ‘the calculation.

An extrapolation: of the graphs of Fig. 43 shows that both fluorobo-
rate salts (500 and 1500 ppm oxide impurity) are ‘more ‘aggressive than the
fuel :salt to ‘the Hastelloy ‘N alloys. Also, it appears ‘that identical rates
would ‘be found for the type 304L stainless steel—fuel salt: combination
and ‘the titanium-modified Hastelloy N—fluoroborate salt (500 ppm oxide

impurity).
 

 

74

It would be expected, if the solid-state diffusion mechanism
controlled, that the calculated rates of Fig. 43 based on diffusion

- coefficients would be identical to the experimental rates. However,

results of only the titanium-modified Hastelloy N—fuel salt system
coincided with the calculated values. Incidentally, fuel salts were

used in the earlier experiments that showed that the rate was controlled
by the diffusion coefficient of chromium in the alloy.?3 Thus, we have
shown that another mechanism besides chromium solid-state diffusion is

controlling the process for several of the metal-salt systems investigated

~ here.

‘The weight losses of the specimens exposed to the fluoroborate salt

“and the value calculated for 600°C and 4000 hr are compared in Table 15.

It is noted that the experimental losses are greater than those calculated.
As has been discussed earlier, the impurities in the fluoroborate salt
appear to be very important because of the formation of HF, which is
strongly oxidizing and will attack all the constituents of the Hastelloy N
alloys. However, in the salt containing 500 ppm oxide impurity the
titanium-modified alloy showed smaller weight losses than the standard
alloy, again because of its lack of iron. In the salt with 1500 ppm oxide
impurity more HF was available for attack, and the weight losses

were higher, since measurable amounts of nickel and molybdenum were

removed from the alloy. An increase in nickel and molybdenum concentrations

‘is often noted in the salt analyses under these conditions. The amount -

of attack is approximately doubled. Because of the large amounts of
nickel and molybdenum in the alloys very little differences in the weight
losses of the standard and titanium-modified alloys will be noted when
large amounts of HF are available for attack. It is also believed that

this HF attack is responsible for the mixed kinetics noted earlier.

With respect to the deposition process, it is obvious that the
calculated rate includes’ only the weight changes that occur from the
deposition on the surface. The amount of the diffusion into the metal
is not measured. However, during the straight-line portion of deposition
with time, on which the kinetic calculations are based, it was theorized
that the rate at which the metal deposited is the same as the rate at
which it diffuses into the container wall. In time the weight gains

would continue, the amount of deposited material on the surface would

remain essentially constant, and a chromium gradient would appear in
. the colder sections. All experimental findings do support these

suppositions.

The kinetic calculations for the weight-gain portion of the mass
transfer show a mixed control between solid-state diffusion and solution
rate. Analogous to the behavior in the hot leg, in the cold leg the .

weight ‘gains could be first solution-rate controlled and later, as the

process slows down, be controlled by the diffusion. Thus, the overall
effect would be ‘mixed control. As theorized earlier ‘it still appears

that the action in the cold leg controls the mass transfer process for

the entire system. i

In liquid metal systems, “the simple approach to. the mass transfer
problem is the statement that the weight loss rate is a function of the
difference in the solubility of the dissolved metal at the temperatures

 
 

 

 

76

‘of interest. The proportionality constant may be related to the diffusion

coefficient of the metal in the liquid if diffusion is the controlling

step or may be related to another factor concerning some process occurring

at the interface if the rate of solution is controlling. However, many

additional ‘models have been required to explain all the experimental
findings. The most ticklish problems involve the possible effect of
oxygen on the solubility of certain metals in liquid metals, the velocity
effect, and the downstream effect. Similar problems exist in the fused
fluoride salt systems. In the salt systems, we can make the general
statement that the corrosion rate in fuel salts is a function of the

chromium and iron contents of the alloy. In the fluoroborate salts, the

rate is a function of the alloy composition and the impurity level of the

salt. The proportionality constant for both cases is a function of
temperature and can be found experimentally. As in liquid metal systems, -

the rate controlling mechanisms are not entirely clear cut but are

- functions of many variables.

Although the corrosion of these systems has been widely discussed,
it should be pointed out that the weight loss rates are quite low.

SUMMARY

Our data on mass transfer in the fluoroborate salt mixture points
out that impurities such as water and oxygen strongly affect the fluoride
oxidation potential of this salt. However, we do not yet completely |

know the chemical forms taken by these impurities upon entering the salt.

Corrosion rates show a marked increase following an air or steam leak

into the fluoroborate salt. Once the leak has been detected and corrected,
the corrosion rate drops sharply. Analyses of the salt shows an increase
in oxide level as the corrosion rate increases; the explanation for this
behavior is that moisture reacts with the salt to produce HF and compounds
(oxides and hydroxides) that analyze as oxides by the present techniques.
The HF causes rapid oxidation of the containment material and is used up
in the process. The compounds that analyze as water and oxygen remain

but have only a minor effect on corrosion rate. Kinetic considerations

showed that the mass transfer process is between solid-state diffusion
 

 

 

«t

77

control and solution control, probably depending on the amount of

impurities allowed to enter the salt. The mass transfer behavior is very

‘similar to that seen for the chromium-UF, corrosion reaction, the

difference being that other alloy constituents (beside chromium)
participate in the process and the reaction rates are different. We have

also shown the difficulty.in keeping the fluoroborate salt mixture free -

. of moisture-type impurities but feel that this can be done by exercising

sufficient care.

Except for certain periods of the fluoroborate tests, the overall
corrosion rates have been relatively small. Thermal-convection loop
NCL-14 has operated successfully for over two years and the pump loop
MSR-FCL-1 nearly one year with the fluoroborate mixture. Comparison of
the rates experienced by NCL-13A, NCL-14, and MSR-FCL~1, all circulating
the sodium fluoroborate mixture, indicates a velocity effect on the mass
transfer (Table 16). We believe that the effect of velocity on corrosion
in this system is a function of declining importance as the purity level
of the salt improves. The impurity effect per se has been discussed in
detail previously. Because of the importance of the impurities on the
corrosion of Hastelloy N by fluoroborate, efforts have begun on methods
of purifying the salt. Also to be considered are better methods for
analyzing and identifying the impurities. At some purity level, perhaps
200 to 400 ppm oxide as analyzed, solid-state diffusion of chromium in
the Hastelloy N will likely control corrosion, as it does in the fuel
salts. This is most important, since it suggests that an entire MSBR
of either the one- or two-fluid variety can be operated with none of the
main circulating channels . suffering more than a few tenths of a mil per
year corrosion attack. Experimental proof of this is one of our major

near-term goals.

CONCLUSIONS

The corrosion rate is a function of the alloy composition and

impurity level of the salt.

Because of the corrosive nature of the BF; in an impure state and

because it is present in appreciable quantities over the melt, leaks

in mechanical portions of the systems can easily occur.

Kinetic considerations disclose that the weight change rates are

controlled by a mixture of solid-state diffusion and solution rate.

The effective diffusion rate that controls the hot-leg attack is

larger than the volume diffusion coefficients obtained in typical

diffusion experiments.

The mass transfer behavior (weight losses in hot leg, weight gains

in cold leg, steady balance points) is very similar to that seen for

the chromium-UF, corrosion reaction.
