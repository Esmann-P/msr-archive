TWO-FLUID MOLTEN-SALT BREEDER REACTOR DESIGN STUDY |
(STATUS AS OF JANUARY 1, 1968)

R. B. Briggs E. S. Bettis

ABSTRACT

A conceptual design study of a 1000-Mw(e) thermal breeder power station based on a two-fluid -
MSBR was commenced i in 1966 as part of a program to determine whether a molten-salt reactor using

the thorium-2 334 fuel cycle could produce electric power at sufficiently low cost to be of interest and

at the same time show good utilization of U.S. nuclear fuel resources. This report covers the progress

- made in the study up to August 1967, at which time the two-fluid MSBR work was set aside in order

to study a single-fluid MSBR concept. The latter became of interest at that time due to the discovery
that protactinium and other fission products could be separated from a uranium-and-thorium-bearing

_ fuel salt by reductive extraction into liquid bismuth.

The two-fluid MSBR is graphite-moderated and -reflected, with a TLiF] BeF,-UF, fuel salt

"circulated through the core and a TLiF- “ThF 4-BeF blanket salt circulated through separate flow

channels distributed throughout the core, as well as in a surrounding undermoderated region. The
fissions raise the temperature of the fuel salt to about 1300 °F and that of the blanket salt to about
1250°F. Heat is removed from the salts in shell-and-tube heat exchangers to raise the temperature of a
circulating NaBF4-NaF coolant salt to about 1150 °F, The coolant salt transports the heat to steam
generators and reheaters to provide 3500-psia 1000 °F/1000 °F steam for a conventional turbine-
generator.

The conceptual design was based on use of four reactors and the associated heat transfer systems
in a so-called modular arrangement to supply steam to a single turbine-generator. This made it
practical to consider replacement of an entire reactor vessel assembly after the core graphite received
its allowable exposure to neutrons. The total fluence at which it was thought that additional graphite
dimensional changes would become excessive was taken as 3 X 10%? neutrons/cm?® (E > 50 kev), or
about eight years of full-power operation.

All portions of the systems in contact with the fluoride or fluoroborate salts would be fabricated
of Hastelloy N that has a small amount of titanium added to improve the resistance to radiation
damage. The graphite would be a specially coated grade having low gas permeability to xenon and
better resistance to radiation damage than conventional material. The two-fluid concept involves
joining graphite core elements to Hastelloy N tubing using a brazing process developed at ORNL.

The reactors and associated systems would be housed in concrete cells to provide biological
shielding and double containment of all radioactive materials.

Plant flowsheets and layouts were developed sufficiently during the study to give an indication of
feasibility and to give a basis for cost estimates, but no optimization studies were made. Safety aspects
were considered throughout the design effort, but no formal safety analysis was completed.

. Fuel and blanket salts would be continuously processed in a nearby cell to remove fission products
and to recover the bred product. The processing rate would correspond to removal of uranium and

" protactinium from the blanket on a 3-day cycle and rare-earth fission products from the core on a

60-day cycle. Since no conceptual designs for the chemical plant were completed, cost estimates could

-not be on a definitive basis. The tentatively estimated fuel cycle cost is about 0.5 mill/kwhr, which

includes the fixed charges and operating costs for the processing equipment, the fuel inventory charge,

-and the credit for bred fuel. Graphite replacement costs, which are not included, would add about 0.2
) mill/kwhr.

The tentatively estimated total construction cost of a 1000-Mw(e) MSBR station, based on the
early 1968 value of the dollar, is about $141 per kilowatt. The power production cost for a privately
owned station, based on fixed charges of 13.7% and 80% plant factor, is about 4 mills/kwhr. The net
thermal efficiency of the plant would be about 44.9%. _

The off-gas, fuel processing, afterheat removal, and maintenance systems needed ‘further
investigation at the time the study was suspended, and the limited performance of the graphite

undoubtedly restricts the design and imposes a maintenance penalty, but the study did not disclose

any aspects which indicated that major technological discoveries would be required to design a two-

: fluid molten-salt reactor power station, The major concern was whether mechanical failure of graphite

tubes in the reactor core would cause the effective lifetime of the core to be significantly less than the

“eight years imposed by the effects of irradiation on the graphite.

1. INTRODUCTION

The basic objective of the Molten-Salt Reactor Pro-
gram is to develop the technology for economical
nuclear power reactors that make use of fluid fuels
which are solutions of fissile and fertile materials in

suitable carrier salts. A major goal is to achieve a

thermal breeder reactor based on the thorium-233U
fuel cycle that will produce power at low cost while
conserving and extending the nation’s fuel resources.
Conceptual design studies of a variety of molten-=salt
breeder reactors for large plants are an important part
of this program. In August 1966 we published a survey
report, ORNL-3996,! in which we described briefly the
status of molten-alt reactor technology and the designs
of reactors and fuel processing facilities for 1000-Mw(e)
power stations. This survey led us to conclude that the

- two-fluid reactor which separates the fuel and blanket

salts held the most promise for development as a

breeder reactor. The modular version, consisting of four

reactor modules and associated intermediate systems
supplying steam to one turbine-generator, v was selected
for more detailed analysis.

The study of the modular design of a 1000-Mw(e)
plant was begun in the fall of 1966, and some of the
results were published in the MSRP progress reports,

" ORNL-4037,> ORNL41192 and ORNL4191.* Much

of the effort was spent on designs for the core and in
exploring the effects of radiationinduced damage to
graphite on the core designs. The plant layout, the cell
designs, the drain tank systems, the nuclear character-
istics, the maintenance, and the cost estimates were also
examined in more detail than had been possible in the
earlier survey.

Considerable progress had been made in these studies
when, in August 1967, encouraging information ob-
tained from research on the processing of molten-alt
fuels indicated that protactinium and some fission
products could be separated from the uranium-and-

thorium-containing fuel salt of a one-fluid reactor by

reductive extraction into liquid bismuth. At about this
same time, nuclear calculations indicated that a conver-
sion ratio greater than 1 could be achieved in a

one-fluid reactor of acceptable dimensions by increasing
the fuelsalt-to-graphite ratio in the outer regions of the
core. The one-fluid breeder is mechanically simpler than
the two-fluid breeder because it involves only one salt
stream, which contains both the fissile (*33U) and the
fertile (thorium) constituents. Also, the one-fluid
breeder is a direct descendant of the one-fluid Molten-

Salt Reactor Experiment, which has operated well at

Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The attractive pos-
sibility of being able to progress in a direct path from
the MSRE to large thermal breeder reactors of similar
design led us to set aside the studies of two-fluid

“breeders to examine one-fluid breeder reactors in equal

detail. The studies of the one-fluid breeders were begun
in September 1967 and are continuing.

Although the one-fluid breeder has the desirable
features mentioned above, the fact remains that the
two-fluid MSBR is inherently capable of achieving a
significantly higher breeding performance. This feature
alone will sustain interest in the two-fluid system. It is
thus important to document the progress made in the
two-fluid breeder study before it was set aside. Present-
ing this information adequately is difficult, because
several months of studies of the one-fluid reactor have
changed some of our ideas about MSBR design, and
new data relevant to the two-fluid reactor have con-

"tinued to come from the research and development

program. For example, the physical properties of the
salts have a profound influence on the design, yet many
of these properties are under continuous study and
adjustment. Some of the new information will be
mentioned briefly, but the reader should understand
that this report does not fully represent current ideas

"and that some designs and conceptual drawings pre-

sented here would be considerably altered if they were
to be reexamined on the basis of today’s knowledge.

The studies upon which this report is based involved
personnel from almost all the divisions of ORNL, but
particularly those from the Reactor Division, Reactor
Chemistry Division, Chemical Technology Division, the
Metals and Ceramics Division, and the General Engi-
neering Division. A group composed of members of
these divisions, under the leadership of E. S. Bettis,
provided the conceptual designs and data which are
basic to the report.

2. RESUME OF DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

Several basic considerations influenced our choice of
a two-fluid MSBR concept and many of the details of
the plant design. They are reviewed here to provide the

«© N
reader with a better understanding of the design that
evolved.

A simplified diagram of a two-fluid breeder reactor is
shown in Fig. 2.1. The core of the reactor consists of an
Lo array of tubular graphite elements in the center of the
reactor vessel. A molten fuel salt is recirculated through
the graphite elements and through a shell-and-tube heat
exchanger by means of a centrifugal pump. A molten
blanket salt is similarly recirculated through the space
around and between the graphite pieces in the reactor
vessel and through an external heat transport circuit.
Heat generated in the reactor is transferred from the
fuel and blanket salts to a coolant salt in the heat
exchangers. The coolant salt is recirculated through
steam generators where the energy is used to convert
the feedwater into superheated steam that drives a
conventional turbine-generator to produce electricity.

The MSBR is a thermal breeder reactor that is
intended to attain the highest breeding performance
consistent with producing power at low cost. Our past
studies have indicated that a good measure of the

performance of a breeder system is the total quantity of
fissionable material that must be mined in order to
provide the fissile inventory for a large nuclear power
system. This total ore requirement should be low. The
terms that describe the performance vary with the
assumed growth rate of the nuclear electrical industry
and the types of reactors that precede and accompany
the breeders, but in the range of interest the per-
formance of a breeder is approximately proportional to
the product of the breeding gain G and the reciprocal
of the square of the specific inventory, 1/S2. The
“conservation coefficient” G/S? for MSBR’s can be
expected to be in the range of 0.02 to 0.10, where the
specific inventory has units of kilograms of fissionable

material per megawatt of electricity and the breeding

gain is dimensionless.

A practical thermal breeder reactor can only be
fueled on the thorium-233U cycle, and it has a small
potential breeding gain. Typically, nn for an MSBR is

2.22 neutrons produced per neutron absorbed in fissile

material that is an equilibrium mixture of 233U and

2357, Absorption of one neutron in fissile material
and one in fertile material leaves 0.22 of a neutron for
losses to moderator, carrier salt, leakage, higher iso-
topes, protactinium, fission products, and structural ma-
terials and for absorption in thorium to produce the
gain in 233U,

Achieving high performance in a breeder depends on
keeping the parasitic absorption of neutrons and the
specific inventory of fissile material low. Losses to
carrier salt, moderator, and structural materials and the
rate and cost of processing to keep the fission product
losses low all decrease with increasing concentration of
uranium in the fuel salt and increasing inventory in the
reactor core. The specific inventory, however, includes
the iventory in the heat transfer equipment external to
the reactor vessel, in storage, and in the fuel processing
plants, so that the specific inventory and the total
inventory cost increase rapidly with increasing concen-
tration of uranium in the fuel salt. The breeding gain
and specific inventory must be balanced to obtain the
highest breeding performance (large G/S?) that is
consistent with producing power at low cost.

The favored fuel salt contains about 0.2 mole % UF,,
of which about 70% is 233U and 23°U, 23% is 234U,
and 7% is 23¢U. The uranium fluoride is dissolved in a
"LiF-BeF, (67-33 mole %) carrier salt. As shown in
Table 3.1, this salt has a liquidus temperature of about
840°F and good flow and heat transfer properties at the
working temperatures. It also has excellent thermal and
radiation stability and, with the use of ?Li, a low cross
section for the parasitic absorption of neutrons. A
ThF,4-7 LiF-BeF, salt (27-71-2 mole %), which melts at
about 1040°F, is a good choice for the blanket salt. The
physical properties of this salt are also shown in Table
3.1.

Although lithium and beryllium nuclei are good
moderators for neutrons, the moderating properties of
the fluoride salts are not sufficiently good, when
compared with their neutron absorbing properties, to
build a thermal breeder without the use of other
moderator. Graphite is the best material for this
purpose, because it has good moderation properties, a
low neutron absorption cross section, and good struc-
tral properties at high temperature and can be used in
direct contact with molten fluoride salts.

The design and performance of the reactor depend
considerably on the effects of fast neutrons on the

graphite. Neutron irradiation causes graphite to change

dimensions and its physical properties to deteriorate.
The life of the graphite is expected to be limited to
some total exposure to fast neutrons and therefore to
vary inversely with the maximum power density in the

core. Selection of a design power density for the core

must be based on a balance between the costs of fuel -

inventory, periodic replacement of the graphite, and
other factors that reflect on the net cost of the
electricity produced.

In order for the graphite to have an acceptable
radiation life, we estimate that the maximum power
density should not exceed about 100 kw per liter of
core volume. With this limit on power density, the core
of a centralstation power reactor would have a volume
of several hundred cubic feet. This size is too large for
the core to consist of graphite bars and highly enriched
fuel salt contained in a thin metal shell and surrounded

‘by a region of blanket salt. The critical concentration of

2337 in the fuel salt would be so low that the
absorptions in the carrier salt and the graphite would be

-excessive. Absorption of neutrons by the shell would

further degrade the performance.

The concentration of 233U in the fuel salt can be

raised to the desired level by dispersing blanket salt
throughout the core. This is accomplished by making
the graphite moderator in the form of tubular elements
and flowing the fuel salt through the elements and the
blanket salt around the elements. The core composition
is obtained by optimizing the relative volumes of fuel
salt, blanket salt, and graphite within bounds imposed
by limits on the concentration of thorium in the
blanket salt and by the engineering of the core.

Results of many calculations have shown that the
combined neutron losses to fuel and blanket carrier

salts, the graphite moderator, and higher isotopes will
be near 0.11 in an optimized reactor, leaving 0.11 for
other losses and the breeding gain. Leakage losses are
reduced to a small amount by a thorium blanket of
reasonable thickness around the core. The losses due to
protactinium are kept small by keeping its concen-
tration in the blanket salt low. This is accomplished by
having a blanket of large volume at low neutron flux or
by removing the protactinium from the blanket salt on
a few-day cycle and allowing it to decay in the
processing plant. Xenon-135 must be removed from the
fuel salt on a few-second cycle, or the surfaces of the
graphite elements must be sealed to greatly reduce the

rate of diffusion of xenon into the pores. Most of the -

other fission products must be removed by processing

the fuel salt on a 30- to 50-day cycle. Limiting the total

of the above losses to 0.03 ‘to 0.07 appears to be
reasonable; this leaves a potential breeding gain of 0.04
to 0.08.

A reactor with a breeding gain in this range and a
specific inventory of 1.5 kg/Mw(e) or less will have
good breeding performance. In order to have this low a
 

 

”n

specific inventory, the amount of ?32U external to the
reactor core must be kept to a minimum. The heat
transfer circuit of the reactor must be closely coupled

‘to the reactor vessel, and it must have high perform-

ance, The fissile inventory in the blanket systems must
be kept small by extracting the bred 233U from the
blanket salt ona few-day cycle and making it available
for adding to the fuel salt to compensate for burnup.
Processing the fuel and blanket salts at the reactor site

_ is necessary to avoid inventory in transport and storage,

and short cooling: time is important in reducing the
inventory in processing. The processes must be simple
and involve few changes in the physical or chemical
nature of the salts if they are to be carried out rapidly
and inexpensively. Fluorination to remove the uranium
as the volatile UF¢ followed by vacuum distillation to
separate the carrier salt from the rare-earth fission
products satisfies these requirements for processing the
fuel salt. Fluorination to -remove the uranium or
extraction of protactinium and uranium into molten
bismuth can satisfy the requirements for the blanket.

With thorium blanket salt dispersed throughout the
core, the breeding gain is largely independent of the size
of the core, but this arrangement imposes several
conditions on the design. The first of these is that
graphite elements must be joined to metal-piping in the
reactor vessel. A perfect separation between the fuel
and blanket salts is not essential to the safety of the
operation, but the leakage must not be so great as to
put an excessive burden on the processing facilities.
Processing considerations lead to a preference for any
leakage to be blanket salt into fuel salt, and the leakage
must be kept below about 1 ft*/day in a 1000-Mw(e)
plant. Such a plant would have several hundred graph-
ite-to-metal joints. Our experience led us to choose
graphite-to-metal brazing as the method for obtaining
adequate leak-tightness.

The graphite elements for the core must be of a size
and shape that are within the capability of manufac-
turers to make and inspect for reasonable cost and with
good quality control. Isotropic material appears de-
sirable and may be essential from the standpoint of
irradiation effects. Thicknesses of sections must be
limited so that the temperature rise due to heating in
the graphite is not large. Effects of irradiation increase
with temperature, and stresses increase with tempera-
ture difference, so a large rise in internal temperature
could result in a large decrease in service life of the core
elements. Graphite tubes 6 in. or less in diameter and

“with a wall % in. or less in thickness appear to fulfill all

these requirements.

Neutron irradiation produces substantial changes in
length of the graphite elements, and the difference in
expansion of .the graphite and the metal parts of the
reactor vessel with temperature changes can also be

large. These effects must be accommodated without

overstressing the graphite. We propose to accomplish
this by making the graphite elements in the form of
concentric tubes connected to the reactor vessel at only
one end in order to provide freedom for axial expansion
and contraction. The fuel salt would flow in and out at
the same end of the elements, and the connections
would be to tube sheets at the bottom of the reactor
vessel to allow the salt to drain completely.

Because of the irradiation effects, the graphite tubes
will have to be replaced periodically. Also, one could
expect an occasional failure of a graphite element or a
graphite-to-metal joint from other causes. The reactor
vessel ‘and internals will be highly radioactive after a
short time at high power, and with the graphite
elements brazed to a tube sheet in the bottom of the

~ reactor vessel, individual tubes could not be readily

inspected or replaced. We concluded that the most
practical way to renew the graphite in the core would
be to replace the entire reactor vessel and its contents.
Suitable provisions would be required for remotely
operated tools and viewing equipment to cut, weld, and
inspect joints in the piping system. Provisions for

handling and disposing of spent reactor vessels would

have to be included in the plant.

The high melting temperatures of the salts make it.
necessary to preheat the reactor equipment to high
temperature before introducing the salts and to main-
tain the temperature when they are present. The special
problems of maintenance and inspection of the reactor
equipment after it has become radioactive led to our
proposals to install the reactor systems in heated cells,
which are comparable to large furnaces, rather than to
apply heaters and insulation to the vessels and piping. -

In our studies of designs for moltensalt breeder
reactors, we are concerned primarily with power sta-
tions having outputs of 1000 Mw(e) or more. The
capacities of salt circulation pumps, heat exchangers,
steam generators, etc., needed for such plants are
greater than could reasonably be designed into single
units. In the 1000-Mw(e) MSBR design described in
ORNL-3996,! - we chose to connect four primary heat
removal circuits to one reactor vessel, to provide one
coolant and steam generator circuit for each primary
heat removal circuit, and to send the steam from all the
steam generators in the plant to one turbine.

 
 

Since the two-fluid breeder has a blanket of low 233U
and high thorium content around the core to capture
the leakage neutrons, reactors of this type can have
about the same breeding performance over a wide range
of size if the maximum power density in the core is
held constant. These facts, together with the special
problems and time required to replace a reactor vessel,
led us to consider a modular design for the two-fluid
MSBR in which. separate, but smaller, reactor vessels
would be coupled to primary heat removal circuits to
provide four autonomous reactor systems delivering
steam to -one -turbine-generator. This modular plant
would be slightly larger than the integral plant, since
four small reactor vessels with associated control sys-
tems would be substituted for the single larger vessel.
Otherwise the equipment in the plant would be the
same. The advantage would be that the plant could con-
tinue to operate at part load while one or two modules
were down for maintenance. We were sufficiently im-
pressed by this capability to make the modular concept
the basis for the design studies described in later sec-
tions of this report. No analysis was made of the opti-
mum size for a module. We simply decided for the pur-
poses of this study to provide four modules in our
1000-Mw(e) plant.
~All our designs for MSBR plants have fuel and blanket
circulation systems that are separated from the steam
system by an intermediate coolant system. If the steam
system were coupled directly to the fuel salt system by
means of a steam generator, any leaks in the tubes of
the steam generator would result in steam or water
leaking into the fuel salt. Reactions between water and
fuel salt would not be violent, but corrosive hydrogen
fluoride would be generated, and uranium oxide would
precipitate in the salt. Also, special provisions would
have to be included in the design to prevent the fuel
circulation system from being raised to the high
pressure of the steam system. Molten sodium, helium,
and other coolants have been considered for use in the
coolant system, but we prefer a molten salt. Sodium
reacts with the fuel salt to generate considerable heat,
precipitate uranium, and raise the melting point of the
salt, Helium does not react with the salt but must be
used at high pressure in order to obtain a good heat
transfer coefficient in the primary heat exchanger. At
best the heat transfer coefficient with gas is con-
siderably less than can be obtained with sodium or salt

“and results in an undesirably high inventory of fuel salt

and fissionable uranium in the reactor system. The
TLiF-BeF, coolant salt used in the MSRE is a good
coolant, but it costs about $1400 per cubic foot, and its
melting point is about 840°F. We would prefer to have

a less expensive cooling salt with a lower melting point.
The salt NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole %) costs only about

$60 per cubic foot, melts at 725°F, and is a favored

candidate for use in the coolant system.

Minimum operating temperatures for the MSBR are
set by the liquidus temperatures of the salts, and the
materials of construction are governed by the operating
temperatures and the properties of the salts. The
reactor fuel and blanket systems must be operated at
temperatures above about 1000°F, and the coolant
system must be operated above about 750°F. High
nickel alloys have good resistance to corrosion by
fluoride salts at high temperature and good creep
strength to about 1300°F. Since the temperature must
be high and the materials are expensive, we believe it
appropriate to couple the reactor plant to a steam cycle
that is representative of the best current practice. The
3500-psia, 1000°F-throttle, 1000°F-reheat cycle that is
presently being specified for most new large fossile-
fueled plants was selected for use in our design studies
largely on this basis. The supercritical cycle has the
added advantage that the feedwater to the steam
generators could be preheated to 700°F without much
loss in thermal efficiency by direct injection of super-
heated steam into the water. This procedure may be
necessary if use of feedwater at a more common
temperature creates problems in the steam generators
by freezing coolant salt on the tubes. (At subcritical

. pressures -the Loeffler cycle employing a steam circu-

lator and mixing drum probably would have to be used
to attain the requisite high-temperature entering
stream.)

Finally, it is important to emphasize that the designs
discussed here are based largely on current technology
and developments that we believe to be readily achiev-
able. The materials, processes, and performance factors
are developed sufficiently that no major inventions
appear to be required to solve the technological
problems.

3. MATERIALS

3.1 General

This ‘section briefly discusses some of the materials
which are unique to molten-alt breeder reactors. These
include the fuel, blanket, and coolant salts; the reactor
graphite; and the Hastelloy N used to contain the salts.
A brazed joint of graphite to Hastelloy N is also
described.

These, or similar, materials have been ander study at
ORNL for many years, beginning with the ANP
1)

program in the early 1950s and continuing through the
MSRE program to the present. Specific evidence has
accumulated that fluoride salt mixtures containing
fissile and fertile materials have the nuclear and physical
properties to make them suitable for use in a molten-
salt thermal breeder reactor. The salts possess suitable
liquidus temperatures and stability to temperature and
irradiation. The Hastelloy N, used to contain the salts,
and the graphite, which acts as the moderator, are
compatible with each other and with the salts. Except
for the graphite, which suffers irradiation damage, there
are no characteristics of the materials which sig-
nificantly limit the MSBR in the concept discussed
here.

The accumulated background of information on the
materials is too extensive to be covered fully in this
report. References are made, however, to some key re-
ports that contain more complete information or bibli-
ographies.

3.2 Salts

3.2.1 General

Table 3.1 shows the salt compositions and physical
properties used in the two-fluid MSBR study. Recently
measured values of the physical properties are also
included where pertinent. (See Sect. 5.6.1 for estimates
of volumes of salts in the systems.)

3.2.2 Fuel Salt

The fuel salt is a ternary mixture of LiF, BeF,, and
233UF, (68.5-31.1:02 mole %). A phase diagram for
the system is shown in Fig. 3.1, and the properties are
given in Table 3.1. :

The MSRE uses essentially the same fuel salt except
that it contains 5 mole % of ZrFs to eliminate the
possibility of precipitating UO, in the event of ac-
cidental contamination of the system with oxygen or
water. The zirconium addition is judged to be unneces-
sary for the MSBR in that the MSRE has been operated
for four years without contaminating the fuel salt,5™7
and the fréquent processing of the MSBR fuel should
keep the oxide content low. |

The MSRE data also indicate excellent compatibility
of the salt with the Hastelloy N and graphite materials
in the system. The corrosion rate of the metal is less
than 0.2 mil/year, and the mechanical properties are
virtually unaffected by long exposure to the salt. The
graphite is not wetted by the salt mixture, and bulk
permeation by the salt is less than 0.2%, well below the
amount considered acceptable.

As indicated in Fig. 3.1, on cooling of the fuel salt in
the temperature interval from about 450°C (842°F) to
438°C (820°F), the compound 2LiF-BeF, precipitates
from the melt. At 438°C (820°F) the salt mixture
solidifies and produces a mixture of two crystalline
phases, 2LiF-BeF, (89 wt %) and LiF-UF, (11%). On
reheating, the mixture resumes its initial composition
and physical properties without change.

A considerable body of information exists to indicate
that the MSRE fuel salt is stable under irradiation and

to temperatureswell above 800°C (1470°F). The MSBR
fuel should behave similarly. However, if irradiated salt
is allowed to freeze and cool below about 100°C
(212°F), radiolysis occurs with release of F,. This
reaction can be easily suppressed by maintaining the
salt above, say, 200°C (390°F).

Fission products will be produced in a 2225-Mw(t)

MSBR at the rate of about 2.3 kg/day. The success of a

moltensalt reactor as a breeder hinges upon the ability

to process the fuel and blanket salts rapidly enough to
maintain the fission products at relatively low levels and
on keeping the costs of this processing low enough to
afford attractive fuel cycle costs. (The processing
aspects are more fully discussed in Sect. 4.4.) Even with
rapid processing, however, the fission product concen-
trations are high enough to cause their behavior in the
salt to be of interest.

Data obtained from the MSRE have confirmed the
chemists’ predictions regarding the state of the fission
products in a moltensalt reactor. The rare gases
krypton and xenon are only slightly soluble in the

high-temperature salt and are readily removed by

sparging the salt with helium bubbles. Rubidium,

cesium, strontium, barium, zirconium, yttrium, and the

lanthanides form very stable fluorides, which are found

primarily in the salt. Some of these elements, such as

rubidium and cesium, have gaseous precursors and
appear in the graphite and the off-gas system in
proportion to the amounts of the precursors that escape
from the salt. The more noble metals from elements 41
and 42 (niobium and molybdenum) through element 52
(tellurium) are largely reduced to the metallic. state in
the salt. They deposit on graphite and metal surfaces in
the reactor and somewhat surprisingly appear in the
cover gas, presumably as a “smoke” of metallic par-

ticles. The distribution of representative fission

products of this group in the MSRE after 32,000 Mwhr
of operation is shown in Table 3.2. A similar distribu-
tion, modified to reflect differences in relative surface
areas and in flow conditions, must be expected in an
MSBR. The data in Table 3.2 and other analyses of
samples of salt indicate that iodine forms stable iodides

“in the salt. Iodine found on MSRE surfaces and in the

cover gas is produced there by decay of the noble metat
tellurium. Bromine forms stable bromides that remain

_in the salt.

3.2.3 Blanket Salt

The blanket salt for the two-fluid MSBR is a ternary
mixture of LiF, BeF,, and ThF, (71-272 mole %).

This system is shown in Fig. 3.2, and the properties are

listed in Table 3.1.

The blanket salt has a liquidus temperature of about
560°C (1040°F), and during solidification the solid
phases LiF-ThF, and 3LiF-ThF, are formed, incorpora-
ting Be? in both the interstitial and substitutional
sites.’

The blanket salt can be expected to exhibit the same
good compatibility with Hastelloy N and graphite under
reactor conditions as does the fuel salt. Capsule tests in -
the MTR demonstrated the radiation stability of similar
salts containing ThF,. Early in the operation of the

. MSRE there was some discussion of eventually opera-

ting with a fuel salt mixture containing thorium, but
this is now considered unnecessary since the results are
largely predictable.

The blanket salt will be processed on a rapid cycle to
remove the bred protactinium and/or fissile material in
order to minimize the fissile inventory, the fission rate,
and the concentration of fission products in the blanket
salt.’ The chemical processing is discussed in more

- detail in Sect. 4.4.

3.2.4 Coolant Salt

In our design of an MSBR, a coolant is used for

_ transporting heat from the primary heat exchangers to

the steam generators ‘and reheaters. Characteristics
considered to be desirable in the coolant include low
melting temperature, compatibility with Hastelloy N,

resistance to decomposition by heat and radiation, good
heat transfer and pumping characteristics, low vapor
pressure at operating temperature, freedom from
violent chemical reactions with associated materials,
and low cost. Sodium is undesirable because of its
reactivity with air, water, and fuel salt. The MSRE
coolant, "LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %), has a liquidus
temperature near 455°C (850°F) and is more expensive
than one would like to use in the large volume of an
“MSBR system. Sodium fluoroborate of the eutectic

composition NaBF4-NaF (92-8 mole %) was selected as

most nearly satisfying all the requirements for a
coolant. The phase diagram for the NaBF4-NaF system
is shown in Fig. 3.3, and the physical properties are
given in Table 3.1.

Several mixtures of fluoroborates of the alkali metals -

were considered in making the selection. Some were
ruled out because of high viscosity or high cost.

Stoichiometric NaBF, does not exist in the molten

state ‘without a very high partial pressure of BF; gas.

The eutectic composition, however, has most of the

* properties considered desirable for the MSBR coolant,

and it can operate with a dilute mixture of BF; in
helium at about 2 atm pressure as the cover gas. The
melting temperature of about 385°C (725°F) is ac-
ceptable. Although a lower temperature would be
desirable, it is not clear at this time whether the
liquidus temperature can be successfully depressed by
use of additives. The fluoroborate has a modest cost of
less than 50f/Ib, and commercial grades may have
acceptable purity.

Thermal convection loop studies of the corrosion of
Hastelloy N by sodium fluoroborate at temperatures to
607°C (1130°F) have indicated a low corrosion rate in
the absence of contamination of the salt by moisture,
although not as low as with the MSRE coolant. As with
other fluoride salts, the presence of moisture greatly
increases the corrosion rates. The absence of severe
corrosion problems is confirmed qualitatively by ex-

perience with the circulation of sodium fluoroborate in

a large test loop for about 1800 hr. A corrosion product
precipitate, Na3CrFg, has been obtained from both
types of loops. Its solubility is inferred to be suf-
ficiently low that cold trapping may be required to
prevent the material from interfering with operation of
the coolant system by depositing on heat transfer
surfaces and in other cooled regions.

Molten sodium fluoroborate has been irradiated in
gamma fluxes as high as 8 X 107 rfhr without
significant effects on the salt. or the Hastelloy N
container and specimens.’

3.3 Hastelloy N

The reactor vessel, piping, and primary and secondary
heat transfer equipment require a material that is
resistant to corrosion by fluoride salts; compatible with
graphite; capable of being fabricated into complicated
shapes by rolling, forging, machining, and welding;
mechanically strong and ductile at temperatures up to
700°C (1300°F); and capable of maintaining these
properties during long exposure to this elevated tem-
perature in a neutron environment, Hastelloy N is the
preferred material for this application.

Hastelloy N is a nickel-base alloy containing chro-
mium for oxidation resistance and molybdenum for

“strength at high temperature. The “standard alloy” has

the composition shown in Table 3.3 and was developed
in the ANP program to contain molten fluoride salts at
temperatures to about 870°C (1600°F). The MSRE was
constructed of standard Hastelloy N. The material was
obtained from commercial vendors, and it was fab-
ricated using conventional practices comparable with
those used for stainless steel. The major ‘material
problem encountered was weld cracking, which was
overcome by slight changes in the melting practice and
by strict quality control of the materials. Heats of the
metal subject to cracking were identified and eliminated
by means of a weldability test included as part of the
specifications.

Results of extensive corrosion tests, examination of
specimens exposed to the fuel salt in the center of the
core of the MSRE, and analyses of samples of fuel salt
from the MSRE have demonstrated the excellent
resistance of Hastelloy N to corrosion by fluoride salts.
If the salt is kept slightly reducing and is not con-
tinually contaminated by oxygen or moisture, the
corrosion rate at temperatures to 700°C (1300°F) is
less than 0.5 mil/year. The effect of the corrosion is to
gradually deplete the alloy of chromium, leaving behind
the major constituents and, at higher temperatures, a
network of subsurface voids.

Irradiation of the standard Hastelloy N by thermal
neutrons drastically reduces the ductility and stress
rupture life of the metal at high temperatures. This

deterioration results from the transmutation of '°B to
lithium and helium, with the latter collecting in the
grain boundaries to promote intergranular cracking. The
irradiation effects become appreciable at a fluence of

- about 10'® neutrons/cm?®. At 650°C (1200°F) and

with stresses above 20,000 psi, metal irradiated to
fluences above 5S X 10'? can fracture with an elonga-
tion less than 0.5% and with less than 1% of the life of
unirradiated metal. Theoretical considerations and some
data indicate that the effects decrease with decreasing
stress.!® The damage occurs even though the boron
content of the alloy is as low as 1 ppm. It is, therefore,
not practical to limit the radiation effect by control of
trace amounts of boron.

Because the MSRE was intended to operate for only a
few years, the standard Hastelloy N was an acceptable
material of construction. A material with greater
resistance to radiation effects is, however, required for
those parts of an MSBR that are subjected to neutron
irradiation. Marked improvement in the properties of

irradiated Hastelloy N has been achieved by adding

small amounts of titanium and/or hafnium or niobium
to a slightly altered base material to obtain modified
Hastelloy N of ‘the range of compositions shown in

‘Table 3.3.

The stress rupture life and the ductility of modified
Hastelloy N can vary considerably with variations in
treatment and in amounts of some minor constituents.
In general, we have found that irradiation decreases the
rupture life and ductility of the modified alloy, but, for
irradiation to fluences of about 10?! neutrons/cm?

(fast and thermal) at temperatures to 750°C (1380°F),
its properties are about equal to those of the standard
alloy when unirradiated. On this basis and on the
assumption that the reactor equipment would be made
of modified Hastelloy N, we used the extensive data on
the properties of unirradiated Hastelloy N in our studies
of designs for the reactor equipment. Those properties
are reported in Table 3.4.

The specific heat, electrical resistivity, and thermal
conductivity data all show inflections with respect to
temperature at 650°C (1200°F). This is thought to be

.due to an order-disorder reaction. No changes in the

mechanical properties are detectable as a result of this
reaction, however. The alloy has greater strength than
the austenitic stainless steels and is comparable with the
stronger alloys of the Hastelloy type. The maximum
allowable stresses shown in Table 3.4 were established
by performing mechanical property tests on experi-
mental heats of commercial size. The data were
reviewed by the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Committee,
and the stress values were approved for use under Case
1315 for Unfired Pressure Vessels and under Case 1345
for Nuclear Vessels.!!

3.4 Graphite

The characteristics desired of the moderator material
for the core of a two-fluid MSBR concept are good
neutron moderation, low neutron absorption, com-

patibility with the molten fuel and blanket salts and

with Hastelloy N, sufficient strength and integrity to

separate the fuel and blanket salts with good reliability,
low permeability to salt and gases, fabricability at
reasonable cost, capability for being joined to Hastelloy
N, and finally, ability to maintain all the desirable

properties after exposure to operating temperatures as

high as about 1400°F and to neutron fluences above

11023 neutrons/cm? (for E > 50 kev). In order to obtain

these characteristics a special grade of coated graphite
will have to be developed specifically for MSBR use.
The chemical purity and neutron performance, com-
patibility with materials, salt permeability, and strength
characteristics are sufficient in currently available

graphite. Preliminary experiments indicate that a sur--

face impregnation can be developed to keep the gas
absorption within acceptable limits. The effect of
neutron irradiation, however, is to first shrink and then
swell the graphite to cause an increase in porosity and,
we expect, a deterioration in physical “properties. The
dimensional changes occur slowly, and their effects on
the neutronics of the reactor can be accommodated by
gradually adjusting the fuelsalt composition, although
at a small detriment to the nuclear performance. The
radiation damage to the graphite, however, limits the
useful life of the reactor core. Increases in cost that
result from more frequent replacements of the graphite
at higher power densities must be balanced against the
cost saving obtained from higher power density to
obtain a minimum cost for power.

The background of information on graphite is ex-
tensive. A detailed report on graphite technology and
its influence on MSBR performance has been prepared
by Kasten ef al'? A few factors are briefly reviewed
here.

Grade CGB!? was the first graphite designed spe-
cifically for molten-salt reactor use and was first made
in commercial quantities for the MSRE. It is basically a
petroleum needle coke bonded with coal-tar pitch,
extruded to rough shape, and graphitized at 2800°C
(5072°F). High density and low gas permeability were
achieved through multiple pitch impregnations and heat
treatments. The material is highly anisotropic, however,
and while suitable for the MSRE neutron fluence, it

~ would not have the dimensional stability needed foran

Tests of the graphite indicate that isotropy is essential
if linear dimensional changes and overall - volume
changes are to be kept small in irradiated material. A
graphite with strong binder and a fairly high density
also appears to be important. For this reason, isotropic
graphite has been specified for use in the MSBR
concepts. Unless otherwise noted, this is the type of

graphite implied throughout this report. The nominal
physical properties expected of the graphite before
irradiation are given in Table 3.5.

There has been recent progress in the development of
isotropic and near-isotropic grades of graphite having
greater resistance to dimensional changes under irradia-
tion. Some of the sources of materials are Speer Carbon

(grades H315A and H337). The isotropic graphites can
be made into various shapes by means of conventional
molding equipment, the limits on the gas permeability
playing a major role in the sequences of operations.
Much of the manufacturing information, however, is
proprietary and unpublished.

While different grades of graphite behave somewhat
differently, it can be generally said that single graphite
crystals expand in the c-axis direction and contract in
the g-axis direction under irradiation by high-energy
neutrons. When large numbers of crystals are bonded
together to form a piece of commercial graphite, the
behavior under irradiation tends to be that shown in

Fig. 6.4, Initially the volume contracts and the density
increases as some of the imperfections in the structure
are filled. On continued irradiation the volume increases
sharply, passing through the initial volume at a fluence
that decreases with increasing temperature. After ex-
amining the available data we concluded that a fluence
of about 2.5 X 10%? neutrons/cm® equivalent Pluto
dose could be sustained at 600°C (1112°F) without
deterioration of the physical properties of the graphite.
As explained in Sect. 6, this corresponds to a fluence of
5.1 X 1022 neutrons/cm?® (E> SO kev). For purposes

~ of the design studies reported here, the time to

accumulate this dose was taken as the design lifetime
for the graphite in the reactor core.’

Graphite with a density of 115 i contains about
23 vol % voids. Low permeation of salt into the voids is
desirable to keep both the fission product poisoning
and the internal heat generation low, particularly after
the reactor is drained, For the MSRE design we
specified that less than 0.5% of the bulk volume of the
graphite should fill with salt; specimens of grade CGB
graphite averaged less than 0.2%. The fuel and blanket
salts do not wet the graphite surface,'? and a pore size
of less than about 1 yu is sufficient to effectively keep
the salt out of the material. Experience with the MSRE
indicates that irradiation does not change this character-
istic.

Gaseous fission products tend to diffuse from the salt
into the voids in the graphite. The graphite should have
a low gas permeability to reduce the levels of the xenon
poison in the core and also to keep the heat generation
due to decay of fission product gases within the
graphite low, A target value of 0.5% Xenon poison
fraction was selected for the two-{fluid MSBR. The
permeability of graphite is usually measured with
helium at room temperature, and a value of less than
10™7 em? [sec is necessary if the diffusion of xenon at
reactor temperature is to be kept to an acceptable level.
Recent tests of six grades of isotropic graphite which

are of interest in the MSBR program showed per-

meabilities ranging from 3 X 10™ to 1 X 107?
cm? /sec.!® Reducing the permeability sufficiently by

151, subsequent studies of one-fluid reactors the design
lifetime was limited to a fluence of 3 X 1022 neutrons/cm? (E
>> 50 kev) on the basis that expansion of the graphite much
beyond the initial volume might increase the permeability to
salt and to account for the more rapid changes that occur at the
higher temperatures of 700 to 720°C in the graphite, More
recent data (July 1969) seem to confirm that the lower fluence
is a better value for graphite obtainable in the near future,

pitch impregnation and graphitization treatments would

be very difficult; however, it is possible to achieve
acceptable permeabilities by depositing pyrolytic
carbon in the surface pores.

In sealing the graphite with pyrolytic carbon the
radiation-induced dimensional changes in the two ma-
terials may be sufficiently different to cause spalling of
the coating. This problem can be largely circumvented,
however, if the carbon is deposited in pores near the
surface rather than on the surface itself.” A method for
depositing the pyrocarbon has been developed at
ORNL. The graphite is cycled between a vacuum and a
regulated pressure of hydrocarbon (butadiene) gas while
it is being heated in a high-frequency induction field to
between 800 and 1000°C (1472—1832°F). The cycles
are of a few seconds duration, and permeabilities of less
than 1.3 X 107° c¢m?/sec have been obtained.!” In
one series of tests the depth of penetration at 800°C
(1472°F) sealing temperature was found to be about
0.015 in..

Calculations were made by Ked!” to determine the
effect on the xenon poison fraction of sealing the
graphite with a thin layer of pyrolytic carbon (or other
low-permeability graphite). Various xenon parameters

“were chosen that would yield a high *35Xe poison

fraction with ordinary graphite, and the calculations
were then extended to demonstrate the effect of the
coatings. The void fraction available to xenon was made
variable in such a way that it changed by one order of
magnitude when the diffusion coefficient changed by
two orders of magnitude. The diffusion coefficient of
1072 ft? /hr'® assumed for the bulk graphite is believed
to be readily attainable. The results are presented in
Fig. 34. It is interesting to note that the diffusion
coefficient in the bulk graphite would have to be 10~7
ft? /hr or less in order to obtain a significant reduction

- in the xenon poison fraction, whereas an 8-mil coating

of 107 ft?/hr material would reduce the poison
fraction to the target value of 0.5%.

"3.5 Graphite-to-Metal Joints

The two-fluid MSBR concept involves the joining of
the graphite core elements to stubs of Hastelloy N
tubing which are then welded into the tube sheets, as
indicated in Figs. 5.3 and 5.5. The graphite-to-metal

joints would be made under carefully controlled shop
conditions. Methods for joining the graphite and Hastel-
loy are being studied at ORNL and have progressed
sufficiently to indicate that the materials can be
successfully brazed together.

It is difficult to join graphite directly to Hastelloy
because the thermal coefficient of expansion of the
graphite is significantly lower than that of the metal.
The mean coefficient of thermal expansion of isotropic
graphite in the temperature range between 70 and
1100°F is about 24 X 107° in./°F, whereas that of
Hastelloy N is about 6.8 X 107

brazing temperatures of about 2300°F.
One of the approaches to the problem is to design the
joint so that the Hastelloy N applies a compressive load

on the graphite as it cools, the graphite being stronger

in compression than in tension. Another approach is to
join the graphite to a transition material having a
coefficient of thermal expansion more nearly that of

the graphite. This material would in turn be brazed to

the Hastelloy N. A refinement of this is to use a series
of transition materials that would approach the thermal
expansion properties of the Hastelloy N in steps.

in./°F.° This dif-
ference is of primary concern when cooling from

One of the families of materials investigated for use in.
transition pieces is the heavy-metal alloys of tungsten or
molybdenum. It was found that tungsten with nickel
and iron added in the ratio 7Ni/3Fe gave far better
fabrication characteristics than those with molyb-
denum.!” By adjusting the composition, the thermal
‘coefficient of expansion can be varied over the requisite
range of about 3 X 107% in./°F to 6 X 107° in,/°F as
shown in Fig. 3.5.)7 Segments with highest tungsten
concentration would be located adjacent to the
graphite, and the segments with the most nickel and
iron would be next to the Hastelloy.”

Test specimens were prepared using nuclear-grade
graphite as well as the Poco type, which has a higher
coefficient of expansion, as shown in Fig. 3.5. The
distribution of the expansion coefficients of the in-
dividual segments in relation to those for the graphite
and the Hastelloy N is also shown in Fig. 3.5. The
composites were made by fabricating the segments
individually and copper-brazing them together in a
vacuum under light load. To achieve an effective bond
between the graphite. and the metal requires prior
metallizing of the graphite surface by subjecting it to
gaseous products of a graphite-Cr, 03 reduction re-
action conducted under a low vacuum at 1400°C.!?

A minimum of intervening segments was employed in
an attempt to reduce fabrication costs. A typical
specimen consists of nuclear graphite, a 0.24n.-thick
segment of Poco graphite, a 0.24n.-thick segment of
80% W-14% Ni—6% Fe alloy, and a 0.2-in.-thick
segment of 60% W—28% Ni—12% Fe alloy joined to the

specimens between 750°C and room temperature over a
20-min cycle failed to produce detectable cracks. The
copper bond between the metallized graphite and the
tungsten alloy remained intact, and there was no
evident reaction or alloying of the copper with the
chromium carbide. It was concluded that the graphite-
to-metal joint would give good performance under
MSBR service conditions.!

4. GENERAL PLANT DESCRIPTION
AND FLOWSHEETS

4.1 General

A large MSBR power station consists of three main
sections: the reactor plant that furnishes high-
temperature steam and breeds new fissionable material,
the turbine that generates the electric power, and the
chemical plant that processes the salts. The functions
and equipment for the three plants are closely inter-
dependent, but it is convenient to discuss them sepa-
rately. Less emphasis will be given to the description of
the turbine plant, since this involves more or less
standard equipment.

In the 1000-Mw(e) power station described in this
report, the heat is generated in four reactors, each
designed for a thermal output of about 575 Mw(t).
Each reactor, module is distinctly separate from the
others, having its own reactor vessel, primary fuel and

blanket heat exchangers, salt-circulating pumps, steam
generators, and steam reheaters. One chemical process-
ing plant serves all four reactor modules. The steam
provided by the four modules supplies one 1000-Mw(e)
turbine-generator in the turbine plant. One regenerative

feedwater system consisting of two parallel streams.

returns boiler water to the reactor modules.

The reactor plant was the main subject of these design
studies, and very little was done on the site and building
layouts and on the chemical processing in addition to
what was reported in ORNL-3996.! In the interest of
making this report more complete, we have included
some information from ORNL-3996.

4.2 Site

The plant site is that described in the AEC handbook
for estimating costs. It is a 1200-acre plot of grass-
covered, level terrain adjacent to a river having adequate
flow for cooling-water requirements. The ground eleva-
tion is 20 ft above the high-water mark and is 40 ft
above the low-water level. A limestone foundation
exists about 8 ft below grade. The location is satis-
factory with respect to distance from population
centers, meteorological conditions, frequency and in-
tensity of earthquakes, and other environmental con-
ditions.

As shown in Fig. 4.1, the plant is in a 20-acre fenced
area above the high-water contour on the bank of the
river. The usual cooling-water intake and discharge

structures are provided, along with fuel-oil storage for a

by 380 ft, as shown in Fig. 4.4, was used in estimating

the building costs. In either case, the building is of steel
frame construction with steel roof trusses, precast
concrete roof slabs, concrete floors with steel gratings
as required, and insulated aluminum or steel panel
walls. The wall joints are sealed in the reactor end of
the building to provide a confinement volume in the
event of a release of radioactivity. The reactor area is
provided with a separate ventilation and air-filtration
system that discharges to a stack.

4.3 Reactor Plant

A flowsheet for a reactor module is shown in Fig. 4.5.

In’ brief, the fuel salt enters the bottom of the reactor
vessel at a rate of 25 cfs at 1000°F, passes through the
core, and leaves at about 1300°F. It then enters the fuel

salt pump at the top of the primary heat exchanger,
where it is pumped into the center section of tubes.
After réversing direction at the bottom, the salt flows
upward through the outer section of tubes and into the
return line to the bottom of the reactor.

The fuel salt pump and its sump, or pump tank, are
below the reactor vessel, so that failure of the pump to
develop the required head causes the salt to drain from
the reactor vessel through the pump tank to the fuel
salt drain tank. The tank above the pump impeller is
required during startup so that the fuel salt can be
pressurized from the drain tank into the primary system
to provide the pump with the necessary submergence
and surge volume as it starts and fills the reactor core.

Helium is used as the cover gas over the salt in the
pump bowl and as the medium for stripping gaseous
fission products from the salt. For this latter purpose,
small bubbles are injected into the salt in the suction
line to the pump and are removed with their burden of
krypton and xenon in a centrifugal separator in the line
from the outlet of the heat exchanger to the reactor
vessel. This gas is circulated through a gaseous fission
product disposal system, described in Sect. 5.9.

The blanket salt enters the reactor vessel at a rate of
43 cfs at 1150°F. It flows along the vessel wall,
through the interstitial spaces between the graphite
elements of the core and the radial blanket, and exits at
about 1250°F. The fertile salt then flows into the
suction of the blanket pump and is pumped through the
blanket heat. exchanger and back to the reactor vessel.
Helium covers the blanket salt at the salt-to-gas inter-
face in the pump. Only a small fraction of the fissions
occurs in the blanket, so there is no need for a gaseous
fission product removal system.

The sodium fluoroborate coolant salt is circulated to
the bottom of the fuel salt heat exchanger at a rate of
37.5 cfs at 850°F, flows upward through the shell, and
leaves at about 1111°F, It then flows through the shell
of the blanket salt heat exchanger, where it is heated to
about 1125°F, and returns to the coolant salt circu-
lating pump, where its pressure is raised from about 110
psig to 260 psig. The pump supplies about 87% of the
coolant salt to the steam generators and the remainder
to the steam reheaters. A cover-gas system is required
for the coolant circuit, the cover gas being a mixture of
boron trifluoride in helium. There is no requirement for
injecting cover gas into the circulating salt or for
removing it.

Each of the salt circulating systems is provided with
heated drain tanks for safe storage of the salt during
shutdown of the reactor. These tanks are described in
detail in Sect. 5.6. The fuel drain tanks have cooling
systems for removal of afterheat. Flow of salt to the
tanks during a drain is by gravity ; salt is returned to the
systems from the tanks by pressurizing the tanks with
helium. A salt seal is frozen in the special valves in the
drain lines to effect a positive cutoff.

A small side stream of fuel salt is taken from the fuel
system at the circulating pump discharge. After storage
in a transfer tank, the salt is processed and reconsti-
tuted in the associated chemical plant to remove fission
product contaminants and to adjust the composition.
The clean salt is returned to the circulating system at
the pump bowl. A side stream is removed from the
blanket system, similarly processed for removal of bred
233p; and 233U, and retuned to the reactor. The
flowsheets for fuel and blanket salt chemical plants are
described in Sect. 4 4.

Fig. 4.7. Sectional Elevation of Reactor Cell.

All the cells containing fuel, blanket, and coolant salts
are provided with electric resistance heating elements
which preheat the systems and maintain the cell
ambient temperature at about 1100°F, well above the
liquidus temperatures of the salts. In addition to the
massive concrete biological shielding, the reactor cell
has thick double-walled - steel liners .to protect the
concrete from excessive temperatures and radiation-
induced damage. The liners also seal the cell spaces to
provide containment for all equipment which contains
radioactive material. The cell structure itself is housed
in a sealed confinement building which provides yet
another. line of defense against the escape of fission
products.

43.3 Reactor Cell

As shown in more ‘detail in \ Figs. 4.7 and 4.8, the
reactor cell contains the 575-Mw(t) reactor, fuel salt
circulating pump, fuel salt heat exchanger, blanket salt
circulating pump, blanket salt heat exchanger, and the

interconnecting salt piping. The cell has circular ends of
12 ft radius and is about 24 ft wide by 40 ft long by
about 63 ft deep, including the 8-ft-thick roof plugs.

In this design version the major components in the
reactor cell are supported on columns, or pedestals,
which penetrate the floor of the cell. The columns rest
on vibration dampers which are supported on footings
beneath the cell floor structure. The degree of pro-
tection against seismic disturbances has not been
analyzed. (Subsequent design concepts for a single-fluid
MSBR adopted an overhead support system.):Differ-
ential expansions in the piping and equipment are
partially absorbed by the: flexibility of the supports.
Figure 4.7 shows the single 18-in.-diam pedestal for the
reactor vessel hinged at the bottom to reduce the
stresses in the fuel salt piping. Calculations made on the
basis of -a fixed joint, however, gave stresses within
allowable limits. Because of the high ambient tempera-
ture in the reactor cell, the support structure would
probably be fabricated of 304 SS. Bellows joints at the
base of each column would provide the necessary
hermetic seal.

STEAM CELL

Fig. 4.8. Plan View of Steam Generator and Drain Tank Cells.

The reactor cell atmosphere will be an inert gas,
probably nitrogen. Since the interior of the cell will
operate at about 1100°F, the cell walls must provide
thermal insulation and gamma shielding to prevent
overheating of the 8-ft thickness of concrete in the
biological shielding. Blanket-type insulation about 6 in.
thick will be used, protected on the inside of the cell by
a thin stainless steel liner which will also serve as a
radiant heat reflector. The construction is shown in Fig.
49. A carbon steel membrane on the outside of the
thermal insulation provides a sealed structure. The
space between this membrane and a surrounding 3-in.-
thick carbon steel thermal shield is also sealed and
continuously pumped down and monitored for leakage
through the inner shell. A second 3-n. carbon steel
plate is separated from the inner plate by a 3-in.-wide

© air space through which cooling air is circulated. At an

air velocity of about 50 fps the maximum estimated
temperature of the concrete is less than 200°F.!°

The electric heaters for the cells are Inconel pipes
welded together at one end to form a hairpin. Lavite

Concept of a Thermal Shield for the Room Housing a

washers separate and support the pipes in the thimbles
in which each unit is inserted. These thimbles are
installed in the permanent portions of the cell roof
structure. With this arrangement individual heaters can
be disconnected and removed in event of failure.
Heaters of this type have proved reliable as reactor
vessel heaters in the MSRE.,

The reactor cell roof plugs would incorporate the
same general design features as the walls. Figure 4.10
shows the double barrier at the top of the reactor cell,
at the thimbles for the electric heaters, and also
indicates how the cooling air can be introduced into the
removable roof plugs. Figure 4.9 shows how the double
barrier sealing membranes would be arranged at the
bottom corners of the reactor cell and at the pedestal

supports to permit relative movement. The total heat
‘loss from the reactor cell has been estimated to be

about 2 Mw(t).
The design pressure for the reactor cell is about 50

- psia. In considering the integrity of the cell it should be

noted that no water is normally present which could
accidentally mix with the hot fuel or blanket salt to
cause a pressure buildup through vaporization. To
prevent accidental entry of steam into the cell via the
coolant salt circuit, rupture disks are provided on the

pressure buildup in the system due to a tube failure in
the steam generator. The rupture disk ratings would be
well below the collapsing pressure of the tubing in the
primary heat exchanger, but even in the highly unlikely
event of tube collapse and shell rupture, sufficient
escape of vapor to cause a significant rise in the reactor
cell pressure does not necessarily follow.

4.3.4 Coolant Cell

Each of these four cells contains a coolant salt
circulating pump, four boiler-superheater units, two
reheater units, and associated salt and steam piping. The
cells are approximately 24 by 45 ft and about 34 ft
deep, including the roof plugs.

The construction is similar to that used i in the reactor
cells in that the cells must be heated and sealed. The

radioactivity, however, is only that induced into the
coolant salt, so there is no need for the steel radiation
shield to protect the concrete. Thermal insulation
would be applied in the same thickness and about the
same manner as in the reactor cell, and the liner would
form the hermetic seal. A double barrier is not required
for containment purposes, but an air flow passage must
be provided to carry away the heat passing through the
thermal insulation to prevent the concrete shielding
from getting too hot. Co

Figures 4.6—4.8 illustrate the arrangement of equip-
ment in the coolant cell. As in the reactor cell, all
components are mounted on support columns which
rest on the floor of the cell. The coolant salt piping is
provided with several expansion loops to achieve the
necessary flexibility without the use ‘of expansion
joints. The expansion of the steam lines is absorbed in

. piping loops located outside the cell. Bellows seals are

provided where the various pipes pass through the
coolant cell walls. Analyses of the stresses in piping and

cooled, the ambient temperature of the cell is relatively
low. The pipes and vessels would be heated or cooled
individually as required. Biological shielding is needed
because of the high level of radioactivity.

4.3.8 Instrumentation Cell

A centrally located cell is provided for the piping,
junction - boxes, controls, etc., associated with the
instrumentation of the reactor complex. This 10- by
80-ft cell would be operated at normal ambient
temperatures and is not a containment area.

A cylindrical cell 20 ft in diameter by 62 ft deep is

reactor vessels and spent graphite cores until most of

the radioactivity ‘decays and they can be processed fc for
disposal. The cells are hermetically sealed.

appreciable technical difficulties and could be con-
sidered in future steam-system optimization studies.
Supercritical pressure was selected for the steam cycle
because it offered better cycle efficiency, followed an
established trend in the steam power industry,?® and
provided an opportunity f for heating the feedwater to
700°F.

The cycle provides for mixing prime steam with the
feedwater to raise the temperature to the inlets of the
steam generators to avoid local freezing of the coolant
salt or excessive temperature gradients in tubing walls.
Future development may show that lower feedwater
temperatures can be used. In this case, sufficiently high
feedwater temperatures possibly could be attained
through additional stages of regenerative feedwater
heating. ORNL4037% and MSR-66-18%! discussed an
alternative cycle in which 580°F feedwater is supplied
to the steam generators and 552°F “cold” reheat steam
is sent to the reheaters. All the feedwater heating would
be accomplished by use of extraction steam from the
turbine, The flow through the steam generator would
be reduced to about 7.5 X 10° Ib/hr, and the boiler
feed booster pumps would not be required. There
would be a saving in the cost of equipment and an
increase in the net overall thermal efficiency from

about 44.9 to 45.4%.

As indicated in Figs. 4.2 and 4.4, space has been

allowed for control rooms, offices, laboratories, shops,
storage, etc.

4.4 Turbine Plant

4.4.1 General

A preliminary study of the MSBR turbine plant was
included in ORNL-3996.! This work has not yet been
extended in any more detail for subsequent MSBR
conceptual design studies.

The steam supplied to the turbine from the steam
generator cells would not be radioactive, and no
reasonable accident situation can be conceived where
contamination could enter the steam-circulating system.
The turbine plant is thus conventional with regard to
design, maintenance, and operational procedures.

The relatively high salt temperatures “which are
available make it possible to generate 1000°F steam and
to reheat to 1000°F. The upper limit on the steam
temperature was chosen more on the basis of current
steam-system operating practice than on specific limita-
tions of the salt systems. Double reheat would offer no

4.4.2 Turbine Plant Flowsheet

The turbine plant flowsheet is shown in Fig. 4.12, and
pertinent data are listed in Table 4.1. The flowsheet is
not represented to be the optimum one but rather is
one that appears to be operable and one upon which
preliminary cost estimates can be reasonably based.

Steam is delivered to the turbine throttle at 3500 psia
and 1000°F. After expansion to 600 psia and about
550°F in the high-pressure turbine, it is preheated to
about 650°F, then reheated to 1000°F before returning
to the intermediate-pressure turbines at about 540 psia.

After expansion to about 170 psia, the steam crosses to
the two double-flow low-pressure turbines, where it
expands to about 1.5 in. Hg abs before entering the
water-cooled condensers. The gross generated output is
about 1035 Mw(e).

The two feedwater pumps are driven by separate
turbines using steam at about 1100 psia taken from an
extraction point on. the high-pressure turbine. (The
pump turbines can also be driven by prime steam if the
need arises.) The capacity of each pump is about 8000
gpm and the nominal power requirement! 20,000 hp
each. Eight stages of regenerative feedwater heating are
used, including the deaerator, employing steam ex-
tracted from the high- and low-pressure turbines and
from the feedwater pump turbines. Full-flow deminer-

- alizers will maintain the feedwater purity to within a

few parts per billion. Feedwater enters the steam
generators at 700°F.

29

The steam system is conventional in almost every .

respect except for preheating of the reheat steam and
the heating of the feedwater to 700°F before it enters
the steam generators. As mentioned above, the steam to
be reheated leaves the high-pressure turbine exhaust at

600 psia and about S50°F. It is then heated on the shell

side of two preheaters by prime steam inside the tubes.
The reheat steam, now at about 650°F and 570 psia,
enters the reheaters, where it is raised to 1000°F by
counterflow with the coolant salt. The reheated steam
retums to the intermediate-pressure turbine at 1000°F
and 540 psia.

The throttle-pressure heating steam leaving the tubes

of the preheater mentioned above, now at about 866°F,
s directly mixed with the feedwater leaving the top
extraction heater at about 550°F and 3475 psia. Since
both streams are at supercritical pressure, the mixing

can be accomplished ‘simply. The resulting 695°F

mixture is then raised to 3800 psia and heated an
additional 5°F by two boiler feedwater pressure-booster
pumps operating in parallel. These 9500gpm pumps are
shown on the flowsheet as driven by electric motors
{about 6000 hp each) but in an optimized system ( could
very well be steam-turbine driven.

4.4.3 Layout of Turbine Plant

The relatively high efficiency of the turbine plant and
use of a 3600pm turbine-generator make the space
requirements for the turbine plant less than for the
turbine-generator in a water reactor plant of the same
capacity. The layout of the plant, indicated in Fig. 44,

is substantially the same as for a conventional station.

The feedwater heaters, pumps, water treatment equip-
ment, etc., would be located on several floor levels of a
building bay provided for this purpose. Use of a
tandem-compounded turbine-generator rather than a
cross-compounded unit would not require significant
alterations to the layout shown.

4.5 Salt Processing Plant

4.5.1 General

A major attractive feature of the two-fluid MSBR is
the relative ease with which the fuel and blanket salts
can be processed to remove fission products, recover
the bred product, and add new fuel. For the reactor to
be a high-performance breeder, the processing must
take place on a fairly rapid cycle and with low holdup
of 233U in the processing equipment. A closely knit
complex of MSBR power stations might make use of a
central processing facility, but the MSBR concept
described here assumes that the processing plant is part
of the 1000-Mw(e) station and serves only the four
reactor modules.

Small side streams of salt are taken from the fuel and
blanket salt circulating systems for processing in an
adjacent cell. A relatively small space is needed for the
processing equipment. A cell having one space about 10
ft X 34 ft X 62 ft deep and another 12 ft X 88 ft X 62
ft deep is provided in Fig. 4.6.

Many of the station facilities such as offices, shops,
laboratories, electrical and water services, waste dis-
posal, data logging and analysis equipment, etc., are
shared by the reactor and salt processing plants.

4.5.2 Fuel Salt Processing

Almost all the fissions occur in the fuel salt, and the
objective of the fuel salt processing is to keep the
fission product concentrations at a low enough level for
the neutron losses to be acceptably low. This must be
accomplished economically and with low losses of
233y and LiF-BeF, carrier salt. The gaseous fission
products, krypton. and xenon, are removed con-
tinuously from the circulating fuel in the reactor as
described in Sect. 4.3.1, In the processing plant the
fluoride volatility process and vacuum distillation are
used to separate the 233U and the carrier salt from
most of the remaining fission products. Discard of a
small amount of carrier salt is required to remove
fission products that distill with the lithium and
beryllium fluorides.

An overall flowsheet for the salt processing plant i is
shown in Fig. 4.13. The fuel salt is drawn semicon-
tinuously - from the circulating systems of the four
reactor modules at a combined rate of about 24 ft /day
(corresponding to a 60-day cycle for a reactor with an
average power density of 20 kw/liter) and is collected in
a holdup tank in the salt processing cell. Since the
reactants used in the processing are not damaged by
irradiation, it is not necessary to provide decay time for .

this reason, but up to 24 hr decay may be required for
the fission product heating to be reduced to a level that
will allow proper control of the temperature in the
fluorination process. Removal of decay heat is a
principal design consideration for the holdup tank and
for other equipment in the fuel salt processing plant.
Salt is drawn from the holdup tank into the process-
ing equipment continuously. Some of the processing
operations are of the batch type, but continuous flow is
achieved through the use of parallel flow paths and
alternate sets of equipment. First, the salt flows to the
top of a fluorination column, where it is contacted by a
stream of fluorine flowing countercurrent to the salt.
The temperature is controlled at about 550°C. The
uranium in the salt reacts with the fluorine to produce
volatile UF¢, which is carried overhead by an excess
flow of fluorine. The uranium removal efficiency is
about 99.9%. Two types of continuous fluorinators are
promising for this application: a falling-drop type,

described by Mailen and Cathers,?? and one in which
the wall of the fluorinator is. cooled to produce a
%-in.thick layer of frozen salt to protect the metal
from corrosion. :

Volatile fluorides of ruthenium, niobium, molybde-
num, technetium, and tellurium are swept out with the
UF. Fission product iodine and bromine are also
present in the gas. The carrier salt, barren of uranium
but containing most of the fission products, flows out
the bottom of the column for subsequent purification
in a vacuum still.

The UF is separated from the other volatile fluorides
in a series of sorption and desorption operations. The
gas is first passed over pellets of sodium fluoride at

about 400°C, where the fluorides of niobium, ruthe-
nium, and tellurium are irreversibly removed, When the
bed becomes loaded with fission products, it is dis-
charged to waste and refilled with fresh pellets. The exit
gas then flows over a bed of sodium fluoride pellets
maintained at about 100°C, where the UF and MoF
are sorbed. When this low-temperature bed becomes
saturated with UF, it is taken off stream and the
temperature is raised slowly to about 150°C to selec-
tively desorb the MoF,. The temperature is then
increased further to drive off the UF4, which is
collected in cold traps at —40 to —60°C. When a cold
trap is loaded with UF, it is warmed to the triple point
(90°C, 46 psia), drained to the reduction unit for
reconstitution of the fuel salt; and then recycled to the
reactor. The fluorine carrier gas leaving the low-
temperature sodium fluoride bed is recycled to the
fluorinator.’ Radioactive technetium, iodine, and bro-

A filter after the reduction unit removes metallic
precipitates from the fuel salt before it is returned to
the reactor modules.

Experience with batch processing by the fluoride
volatility method dates back to 1954 and includes all
phases of laboratory and development work and suc-

* cessful operation of a pilot plant.2® The process was

mine remaining in the recycled gas decay somewhat,

but about 10% purge and makeup with fresh fluorine is
required to keep the concentrations of these gases
within the desired limits.

The carrier salt, on leaving the bottom of the

fluorinator, enters a vacuum still that is operated at
about 1 torr .and 1000°C. Most of the beryllium
fluoride and lithium fluoride distill, leaving behind the
rare-earth fluorides, which would have been the princi-
pal neutron poisons in the reactor. The bottom liquid is
recycled through the still and a decay tank as necessary
to control the heating by fission products. The decay
tank has a volume of about 400 ft*, which is judged
sufficient to collect the fission products over the
30-year life of the plant. At the end of this time, the
lithium fluoride and beryllium fluoride in this waste can
be recovered, and the fission products can be packaged
for permanent disposal.

The distilled lithium and beryllium fluorides contain

small amounts of cesium fluoride and rubidium fluoride

and some zirconium fluoride. A small fraction (no more
than 5%) of the carrier salt is discarded to purge this

- poison. The very small amount of UF, in the carrier

salt that enters the still is also partially volatilized and
recovered.

demonstrated on a large scale in recovering 235U from
the fuel salt in the MSRE. The principles of continuous
fluorination have been demonstrated in the laboratory.
Separation of lithium and beryllium fluorides from
rare-earth fission products by vacuum distillation has
been investigated in the laboratory and has been
demonstrated in an engineeringscale unit by distilling
about half a cubic foot of salt from the MSRE.2* The
reconstitution of fuel salt by hydrogen reduction of
UF in carrier salt has been demonstrated in the
laboratory.

4.5.3 Blanket Salt Processing

The 233U in a two-fluid breeder is produced by the
reaction

5

men Bd nh

All the 233U is produced in the blanket salt. A major
objective of the blanket salt processing is to recover the
233y about as rapidly as.it is produced in order to
make it available for addition to the fuel salt to
compensate for burnup. Rapid processing reduces the
inventory of 233U in the plant and the amount of
fissioning that occurs in the blanket salt. The latter is.
important because thorium is difficult to separate from
the rare-earth fission products except by aqueous

. processes, and accumulation of fission products in the

blanket salt would adversely affect the breeding per-
formance.
- The major objective can be achieved by processing the

blanket salt to remove 23U alone or to remove 233Pa

The lithium fuotide—beryllium fluoride distillate and

the UF from the cold traps are added continuously in
the proper proportions to a reducer, where the fuel salt
is reconstituted for return to the reactor modules. The
UF, is dissolved in the salt at about 600°C and reduced

to UF; by addition of hydrogen and discharge of

hydrogen fluoride. The conditions in the reducing
column precipitate nickel and iron that are present as
fluorides due to corrosion of the processing equipment.

and 233U, Removal of 232U alone can be accomplished
by the proven fluoride volatility process, and this is the
method that was proposed for the two-fluid MSBR in
ORNL-3996." This choice, however, places certain

restrictions on the design of a breeder reactor. The
volume of blanket salt in the low-flux region of the
reactor blanket, or in tanks outside the reactor vessel,
must be large enough so that the average thermal

_ neutron flux seen by the 223Pa is about 10'3

neutrons/cm? or less, if the loss by neutron absorption
to form 234Pa is to be kept below 0.5%. The 233U in

. the blanket salt must be removed on about a 20-day

cycle in order to keep the fissioning to a very low rate.

Removal of the 233Pa as well as the 233U from the

blanket salt can reduce the volume of blanket salt
required and the thorium inventory by a factor of 2 to
3. Such a process has been conceived, and its basic
principles have been demonstrated in the laboratory.
This is now the preferred method for processing the

blanket salt for the two-fluid MSBR and is included in

the flowsheet of Fig. 4.13.
The protactinium removal must be on a short cycle to

be fully effective, possibly as rapid as treating the entire.

blanket inventory once every three days, or at a rate of
about 3.6 gpm. The salt is continuously withdrawn
from the blanket circulating system and enters the
bottom of an extraction column to contact a de-
scending stream of liquid bismuth which contains 3000
to 4000 ppm of metallic thorium. The protactinium
and the small amount of uranium in the blanket salt are
reduced to metal by the thorium and dissolve in the
bismuth. The thorium that is oxidized enters the salt.
Thorium is an ideal reductant because the removed
protactinium is replaced by an equivalent amount of
the fertile material. About 96% of the protactinium and

uranium are removed by the process. The protactinium

and uranium now in the bismuth are extracted into a
second salt mixture; the protactinium is allowed to
decay to uranium, which is released by fluorination to
become the plant product and replacement fissionable
material in the fuel salt.

The bulk of the blanket salt with most of the
protactinium and uranium removed is returned to the
reactor systems, but'a small portion is taken off and
discarded to remove accumulated fission products. This
salt is stored until the residual protactinium decays, and
the uranium is recovered by fluorination before the salt
is discarded.

'5. MAJOR COMPONENTS

5.1 Reactor

In 2 moltensalt breeder reactor the 233U fissions in
the fuel salt and heats the salt as it flows through

graphite elements in the reactor vessel. We considered

several designs for the reactor vessel and the arrange-
ment of the graphite. Two designs finally evolved. One
design is considerably less complicated, but the nuclear
characteristics -are more affected by changes in the
dimensions of the graphite. In the other, radiation-
induced changes in the dimensions of the graphite are
almost fully compensated and would have little effect
on the nuclear characteristics of the reactor. The less
complicated design is discussed first.

- A vertical section through the center of the reactor
vessel for one module of a 1000-Mw(e) plant is shown
in Fig. 5.1, and a horizontal section is shown in Fig.
5.2. The dimensions on the drawing are for a reactor
with an average power density of 20 kw/liter in the
core. Some dimensions for reactor vessels with other
power densities are shown in Table 5.1, The vessel is
made of Hastelloy N and is almost completely filled
with graphite elements or cells. The central portion of
the reactor core contains the fuel celis. These are
surrounded by several rows of blanket cells. A graphite
reflector is interposed between the blanket and the
vessel wall. Blanket salt fills most of the volume of the
vessel above and below the graphite elements.

‘Fuel salt enters the vessel through a plenum in the
bottom, flows through the fuel cells, and leaves through
a second plenum, also in the bottom of the vessel. The
blanket salt enters the vessel through the side near the
top and flows downward along the wall to cool it: The
salt ‘then flows upward through the blanket cells and
through the spaces between blanket cells and between
fuel cells and leaves the vessel through the side near the
top. The channels through the blanket elements and the
spaces between blanket elements are restricted at the
top in order to direct most of. the flow through the
spaces between core elements where the heat pro-
duction rates are greatest.

In moltensalt breeder reactors the major ¢ changes in
reactivity are made by adjusting the composition of the
fuel salt. Control rods are primarily for making minor
changes in reactivity such as those required for ad-
justing the temperature during operation and for
holding the reactor subcritical at temperatures near the
operating temperature. The design requirements for the
control rods have not been studied in detail. Since one
tod in the center of the core can have sufficient worth
for the easily defined requirements, only one is shown
in the design. It is envisioned as a graphite cylinder
about 4 in. in diameter that would operate in blanket
salt. The rod would move in a graphite sleeve, and
provision would be made for good circulation of
blanket salt through the sleeve. Inserting the rod would
increase, and withdrawing the rod would decrease, the

In Sect. 34 we indicated that the graphite could be

of the graphite varies inversely with the damage flux,
which in turn is proportional to the power density in

with an average power density. of 20 kw/liter would
have a maximum power density of 40 kw/liter, a
maximum damage flux of 1.9 X 10? neutrons/cm?,
and a design lifetime of 8.6 full-power years, or 10.8
years with an 0.8 plant factor. Table 5.1 shows how
some of the characteristics of a reactor for one module
of a 1000-Mw(e) plant would vary with average power
density and design lifetime.

Under irradiation the isotropic graphite being con-
sidered at the time of these studies would decrease in
volume by 7.5% during the contraction stage and then
would increase in volume by as much as 7.5% over its
initial volume by the end of its useful life. These
changes in volume correspond to changes in linear
dimensions of *2.5% over the initial dimensions and
create several design problems. The overall lengths of
the graphite fuel cells would change by several inches
during the lifetime of a core and would vary with
location in the reactor. We preferred not to use a
bellows in the fuel salt line to each fuel cell and favored
a minimum number of graphite-to-metal seals. We
therefore chose to have the fuel enter and leave the
bottom of the fuel cell so that each element would have

“only one metal-to-graphite brazed joint and the graphite

would be free to contract and expand axially, as shown
in Fig. 5.1.

The change in radial dimensions presented a more
difficult problem. Densification of the graphite to
produce a 2.5% reduction in distance across the flats of

the hexagonal tubes would cause the fraction of the

cross section of the core occupied by fuel cells to

“decrease by 5%, and the space occupied by the blanket

salt would increase correspondingly. For the reactor
with an average power density of 20 kw/liter, the
volume fractions in the core would change from 0.802
to 0.762 for graphite, 0.134 to 0.127 for fuel salt, and
0064 to 0.111 for blanket salt. Changes of equal
magnitude, but opposite in direction, would occur
during the expansion phase. The rates of change of
dimensions would vary with local power density, so at
no time during the life of a core would the volume

fractions corresponding to the maximum contraction or

expansion exist throughout the core. At the end of life
the graphite at the center of the core would have
reached its maximum volume; graphite in the regions of
average power density would be about at its minimum
volume, and graphite in the outer fuel cells would be
about halfway into the contraction stage.

Stresses arise in the graphite from - dimensional
changes due to gradients in temperature and neutron
flux. A maximum tensile stress estimated to be about
700 psi would occur at an axial position slightly above

37

the center of the core. In subsequent, more detailed
analyses of graphite elements of similar configuration in
a one-fluid reactor concept, the maximum stress was
calculated to be 500 psi.?® These stresses are all well
below the tensile strength range of 4000 to S000 psi of
graphites being considered for use in MSBR’s.%»2¢

No nuclear calculations were completed to show how
the fuel salt and blanket salt compositions would have
to be adjusted to compensate for the change in volume
fractions and how the adjustments would affect the
performance. However, the power-flattening calcula-
tions showed that the power distribution in the core
was quite sensitive to the local volume fraction of
blanket salt. We concluded that a design in which the
volume fraction of blanket salt varied so widely was not
likely to be satisfactory; thus we looked for an
alternative.

An alternative design for the reactor vessel is shown i in
Fig. 5.4. The graphite fuel tube assembly for the core of
this reactor is shown in Fig. 5.5. Blanket cells are
simply cylindrical tubes of graphite 6% ¢ in. OD by 5
in. ID, each with a metal tube brazed into the upper
end. The reference design concept described here is
again for a reactor with an average power density of 20
kwiliter in the core. Basic dimensions of reactors
designed for other power densities are those in Table
5.1.

The primary difference between this design and the
one just described is that in this case the blanket salt in
the core is confined to the annulus between fuel-
containing tubes and the outer tube of graphite
fuel-tube assemblies. The salt in the blanket region is

* confined to the inside of the blanket cells. To accom-

plish this the blanketsalt-containing tubes are con-
nected to plenums in the top of the reactor vessel and
dip into a pool of blanket salt in the bottom of the
vessel. Helium fills the space between core assemblies
and between blanket assemblies at a pressure that is
controlled to provide the desired level of blanket salt in
the bottom of the reactor vessel. :

In this design the changes in axial dimensions are ac-
commodated as before. The graphite tubes are fastened

Behavior and Their Influence on Molten-Salt Reactor Design,”
Nucl. Appl. Technol. 7(8) (February 1970).

27Results of more recent tests (December 1968) indicate that
some isotropic graphites undergo little change i in volume during
irradiations to at least 2.6 X 10%2 neutrons/cm? (E > 50 kev),
the maximum exposure obtained in the tests. Availability of
such materials in the desired sizes and shapes would eliminate
the major objection to this design.

to a metal structure at one end only and are free to
move axially, With blanket salt and fuel salt confined
by graphite tubes in the core region, radiation-induced
changes in the transverse dimensions of the graphite will

produce proportionate changes in volumes of graphite,

40

blanket salt, and fuel salt. The relative volumes of these

materials would remain about constant, and the only
major changes in fractional volume would occur in the
gas spaces between elements. Although the nuclear
characteristics would vary some with time (the amount
had not been calculated when the work was inter-
rupted), it would be surprising if there were a large or
serious effect.

In this design the fuel salt enters the reactor vessel
through a plenum in the bottom, flows through the
reentrant tubes of the fuel tube assemblies, and leaves
through a second plenum in the bottom of the vessel.
The blanket salt enters through a plenum in the top of
the vessel and flows downward through the outer
annulus of the fuel tube assemblies and into the pool of
blanket salt in the bottom of the vessel. Two-thirds of
the blanket salt flow goes out through a pipe from the
bottom of the reactor vessel to the suction of the
blanket salt circulation pump. The discharge from this
pump, after passing through the blanket salt heat
exchanger, enters four ejector-type jet pumps operating
in parallel. The suction side of these jets is connected to
the radial blanket plenum in the top of the reactor
vessel. The jets draw blanket salt upward through the
radial blanket cells and discharge the combined flow
into the plenum that supplies the core elements. This
method was chosen for circulating the blanket salt
because it seems to overcome the problems of distri-
buting the flow between the core elements and radial
blanket elements while assuring that the elements will
be kept full of salt.

5.2 Fuel Salt Primary Heat Exchanger

Each reactor module has a fuel salt primary heat
exchanger in which the fission heat in the fuel salt is
transferred to the coolant salt. The exchanger is of the
vertical countercurrent shell-and-tube type with the fuel
salt in the tubes. The impeller and bowl of the fuel salt
circulating pump are an integral part of the top head
assembly of the heat exchanger. The pump will be
discussed separately in Sect. 54.

The general configuration of the exchanger is shown
in Fig. 5.6, and the principal data are given in Table 5.2.
Each exchanger is about 6.5 ft in diameter X 20 ft high

and has an effective surface of 12,230 ft>. All portions

Fuel salt flows from the reactor at 1300°F through
the 16-in. pipe connected directly to the top of the
circulating pump. The pump boosts the pressure from
about 9 psi to approximately 146 psi and discharges the

~ salt downward through 4347 bent tubes to the lower

42

tube sheet. The flow direction then reverses, and the

salt flows upward through 3794 straight tubes in the
outer annulus, or bank, of tubes and leaves the
exchanger at about 1000°F. The tubes in both banks
are % in. OD, and the salt velocity in the tubes averages
about 9 fps. Using a tube sheet at the bottom, rather
than employing U-tubes, provides a plenum for draining
the fuel salt from the exchanger. A loop in the 2-n.
drain line inside the shell provides the necessary
flexibility for thermal expansion and movement of the
bottom tube sheet. -

The bent tubes in the inner annulus accommodate the
differential expansion between the inner and outer
banks of tubes. To simplify the bends, the inner tubes

are placed on concentric circles with a constant delta

radius and a nearly constant circumferential pitch. A
radial spacing of about 0.6 in. was selected as being the
minimum practical pitch. The tubes in the outer
annulus are located on a triangular pitch of 0.625 in.2®
"The 850°F coolant salt enters at the bottom through
two 14-n. pipes at a pressure of 194 psi and flows
upward through the outer annulus to cool the vessel
outer wall. It then reverses direction and flows down-
ward over the outer bank of tubes in a counterflow
arrangement. At the bottom tube sheet it again reverses
direction and flows upward across the inner bank
of tubes. Doughnut-shaped baffles are used in both
annuli. The salt then leaves through a 204n. coolant salt
pipe at the center line of the exchanger at about
1111°F and 161 psi. Drain ports, not shown in Fig. 5.6,
allow the coolant salt to be drained from the space
above the lower tube sheet.

The heat transfer and stress correlations used in
conceptual design of the heat exchanger have been
reported by Bettis et al.2® The properties of the fuel
and coolant salts and of the Hastelloy N used in the

. calculations are given in Tables 3.1 and 3.4. Computer

codes were written to optimize the salt-tosalt and
salt-tosteam MSBR heat transfer equipment. Except
for some work on the steam generators, however, the

codes were not fully operational when this equipment

was designed.

28GE&C Division, Design Analysis Section of ORNL, Design
Study of a Heat Exchange System for One MSBR Concept,
ORNL-TM-1545 (Sept. 1967).

The number of ‘tubes in each of the annular regions
was determined on the basis of the desirable pressure
drop for the fuel salt flow through the tubes and on the
allowable temperature drop across the wall. The heat
transfer coefficient in the inner annulus needed to be
lowered to minimize the temperature gradient through
the wall; the velocity was therefore reduced by using
4347 tubes as compared with 3794 in the outer
bank.2® The length of the tubes was determined largely
on the basis of preliminary calculations which showed
that 15 ft would provide about the desired geometry.
Baffle spacing in the inner annulus was fixed by the
distances required for the unrestrained bends in the
tubes and the maximum allowable temperature drop
across the walls. The spacing in the outer annulus was
selected to give the most efficient use of the shell-side
pressure drop. Ten baffles were used in this region.?®

In this conceptual design, individual tubes cannot be
inspected, repaired, or replaced. Reliance is therefore
placed on quality control in the manufacture and
installation to obtain highly reliable units. Should major
difficulties develop in an exchanger, however, it would
be necessary to replace an entire heat-¢xchanger—pump

. assembly, as discussed in Sect. 5.10. The rotating parts

of the pump can be replaced with relatively little
difficulty.

As may be noted in Table 3.1, the thermal con-
ductivity of both the fuel and coolant salts is now
known to be substantially less than the values used in
design of the heat exchanger presented here. Use of the
riewer values would increase somewhat the amount of
heat transfer surface and the inventory of salt.

5.3 Blanket Salt Primary Heat Exchanger

Each reactor module has a blanket salt heat exchanger
for transferring heat from the blanket salt to the
coolant salt. The exchangers are about 4.7 ft in
diameter X 19 ft high overall and are of the vertical
shell-and-tube type with the blanket salt in the tubes, as
shown in Fig. 5.7. Although smaller, the units are very
similar to the fuel salt heat exchangers and have the
same arrangement of the salt circulating pumps as an
integral part of the top head. Hastelloy N is used for all
portions in contact with the salts.

The blanket salt is cooled from about 1250 to
1150°F in its passage through the exchanger. The flow
is from the reactor, through the pump, downward

through the inner bank of %-in.-OD tubes, to the

bottom tube sheet, where the flow turns upward

through the outer bank of tubes. Unlike the fuel salt

The coolant salt is circulated in series through the fuel
salt and blanket salt exchangers. The salt leaves the fuel
salt exchanger at.about 1111°F and is heated to about
1150°F in the blanket salt unit, absorbing about 28
Mw(t) of heat per reactor module. The coolant makes
one pass through the shell side, entering through the
20-in.-diam central column, flowing downward between
the disk-and-doughnut baffles, and exiting through a

 

20-in.-diam side nozzle.

Drainage of the blanket salt can be accomplished
through a drain line at the bottom of the tube sheet,

‘not shown in Fig. 5.7. A large pump tank is not

required, as in the fuel salt system, since the reactor
blanket volume is filled with salt before circulation is
started. ©

Essentially the same heat transfer relationships were
used for analysis of both the fuel and the blanket salt
exchangers. The number of tubes per pass in the
blanket unit could be established in a straightforward

‘manner, but determination of the baffle spacing and the

tube length that fulfilled both the heat transfer and
pressure-drop requirements became involved. The first
step was to generate data for the outside film resistance

. as a function of the baffle spacing. It was next

determined whether the baffle spacing was limited by
the thermal stress in the tube wall or by the allowable
shellside pressure drop. Equations were then developed.
to relate the baffle spacing, the outside film resistance,
and the pressure drop, as described in ORNL-TM-
154528

5.4 Salt Circulating Pumps
5.4.1 General

The 1000-Mw{e) MSBR conceptual design employs
four fuel salt circulating pumps and four blanket salt
pumps, one of each for each of the four reactor
modules. The pumps are integral with the primary heat
exchangers, as illustrated in Figs. 5.6 and 5.7. There is
also a coolant salt pump located in each of the four
coolant cells. These pumps are somewhat larger but are
similar to the fuel and blanket salt pumps.

All the pumps are vertical-shaft, sump-type, single-
stage centrifugal units and are driven by electric motors.
The fuel and blanket salt pumps operate at a constant
speed of about 1160 rpm, while the coolant salt pumps
operate at speeds that are variable between about 300
and 1160 rpm. The principal data for the three types of
pumps are given in Table 5.4.

As shown in Fig, 4.7, all the pumps have the electric
drive motors located in sealed housings at the operating
floor level. This facilitates access to the motors for
maintenance, and they can be shielded to protect
electric insulation and lubricants from radiation
damage. The motor housing is thus an integral part of

. the containment system and is subject to the same

integrity requirements.
The fuel and blanket salt pumps have long shafts with
the impeller and casing located some 30 ft below the
LH

“0ne pump is required foreach of the four modules in the MSBR,
bEstimated from preliminary pump layouts,

drive motor. The upper bearing for the shaft is

" oillubricated, but the bearing at the lower end is

lubricated by the pumped salt. In general, a short-shaft
pump with an overhung impeller and all bearings of the
oil-lubricated type are desirable features since there are
fewer development problems with regard to both the
salt-lubricated bearings and the rotor dynamics. Long
shafts were used in this MSBR two-fluid design concept,
however, because the fuel salt enters and leaves at the
bottom of the reactor vessel, placing the pump casing at
about this same elevation conserves salt inventory, and
we preferred to locate the drive motors outside the
reactor cell.

The number of reactor modules selected for the
two-fluid MSBR design study was influenced by the size

of pump that appeared to be a reasonable extrapolation

of the MSRE pump size. One salt pump was assumed
per circuit, on the basis of a study made by Grindell
and Young? which found that parallel operation of
pumps in which the liquid level in the pump bowl is

maintained by a gas overpressure could lead to in- -

stability problems.
Only preliminary studies were completed on the
conceptual design of the salt pumps. Work had pro-

gressed sufficiently to indicate, however, that a careful

study of the effect of pump shaft and casing sizes on
the rotor dynamics would probably be required. Selec-
tion of suitable materials for the salt-lubricated bearing
had just begun when the work was terminated. -

Installed in a Two-Fluid Two-Region MSBR — Effect on Liquid
Levels of Stopping One Pump During Normal Operation,
ORNL-MSR-67-108 (Dec. 22, 1967).

5.4.2 Fuel Salt Circulating Pump

A design concept for the fuel salt circulating pump is
shown in Fig. 5.8. The oil-lubricated ball bearings and
shaft seal at the top are similar to those which have
performed satisfactorily in the MSRE. The seal consists
of a Graphitar stator bearing against a tool steel rotor,
Lubricating oil is on one side of the seal, and helium gas
is in the shaft annulus on the other side. The gas, in
flowing upward through a labyrinth seal, prevents
movement of lubricating oil vapors downward and
scavenges oil vapors from the system. A downward flow
of the purge gas is also provided along the shaft to
retard the upward diffusion of salt vapors and fission
product gases.

Some preliminary development was done on the
salt-lubricated bearing for the lower end of the 34-ft-
long pump shaft. One study®® indicated that self-acting
hydrodynamic film lubrication was to be preferred over
the externally pumped hydrostatic type of film. The
relatively high viscosity of the molten salt provides
good load capacity and hydrodynamic film operation in

Because the fuel salt pump is a critical item in a
molten-salt reactor and the proposed design of pump
was considerably outside the range of our experience,

* some features of the pump were examined in detail.

The rotor dynamics were studied under a contract with
Mechanical Technology Incorporated.3®:32 Computer
studies were made of the conceptual designs to de-

termine flexural and torsional critical speeds and

flexural response to dynamic unbalance. The stability

characteristics of the bearing designs were also re-
viewed. The work, as summarized by Grindell,!
covered both 9- and 7.5-in.-OD shaft sizes. The first
critical speed for the larger shaft was about 700 rpm

~ and for the smaller shaft about 560 rpm, both below

the design speed of 1200 rpm. The second shaft critical
speed was substantially above 1200 rpm for the larger
shaft and about 25% above it for the smaller, Serious
study of the problems of acceleration and deceleration
of both sizes of shafts through the first critical speed
was recommended. It was further recommended that
the pump shaft be designed to operate below the first
shaft critical speed to reduce the probability of low-
speed, high-amplitude whirl and the problems of tra-
versing the critical speed. This would require reduction
of the shaft length, lower design operating speeds, or
both. These objectives would be difficult to attain
without major revisions to the two-fluid MSBR design
described in this report.

A preliminary analysis of the undamped torsional
critical speed* indicated that the two torsional critical
speeds that might affect pump operation could be
strongly dependent upon the electromagnetic torsional
stiffness of the drive motor. By changing some of the

~ component dimensions, such as increasing the stiffness

of the outer pump casing and accounting for inherent
damping, it appeared possible that the pump could
operate satisfactorily between the first and second
critical speeds. If supercritical speed operation were
chosen, the study strongly recommended that a prac-
tical means for dynamic balancing of the shaft be
developed and that a rotor-dynamic evaluation simu-
lator be constructed. This simulator would be a

Salt Pumps for MSBR Power Plants, MTI-67TR48, Mechanical
Technology Incorporated, Aug. 6, 1967.

full-scale model of the pump rotor dynamic system to
evaluate the dynamic response experimentally.

The studies®! indicated that approximately 0.025 in.
of bow in the middle of a uniformly bowed shaft and
approximately 0.019 in. of eccentricity between the
inner and outer diameters of a uniformly eccentric shaft
could be accommodated at the shaft critical speed. The
values are limited by the bearing eccentricity. A bearing
eccentricity value of 0.95 was used in making the
calculations. A survey was made of U.S. manufacturers
who could fabricate the 34-ft pump shafts to the
tolerances required.* One was found who expressed
confidence that shafts of the diameters and wall
thicknesses of interest could be produced with a
guaranteed straightness from end to end of 0.005 in.
and with an OD-ID concentricity of 0.005 in. or better.
It was estimated that the cost would be relatively high,
however. A study of the effect of the tolerances on the
pump design and costs and on the dynamic balancing
facilities required was in the planning stage.

As shown in Fig. 5.6, a startup tank is provided above
the fuel salt primary heat exchanger. The purpose of
the tank is to provide submergence for the pump as it is
started and the reactor is filled, the pumping capacity
of the pump being significantly greater than the transfer
rate of the salt from the drain tank. If the pump were
stopped, intentionally or otherwise, the fuel salt would
flow upward into the bottom of the startup tank and
then through the 5-in. overflow pipe to the fuel salt
drain tank. Since the tank is not provided with a
cooling system the fuel salt is not allowed to fill the
tank to more than a few inches in depth except during
startup, at which time the overflow pipe is closed.

Some cooling of the startup tank and the pump shaft
is provided when the pump is operating. A small stream
of fuel salt from the pump discharge passes partway up
through: the center of the pump shaft and then up

“through a‘ narrow annulus. between the shaft and a

cooling tube surrounding the shaft. Salt leaving the
annulus at the top spills back into the tank. Another
small stream of salt from the pump discharge flows into
the double wall of the tank bottom and upward in the
outer double wall to the top of the tank. The flow then

. turns downward through the annulus formed between

the center column of the tank and the pump casing.
Analysis of the shaft and tank wall heating was only
partly completed, particularly with regard to removal of

* - afterheat. These and other aspects needed further

study.

The pumps are arranged so that the rotary element
can be replaced by remote maintenance techniques
without having to cut any of the salt piping. After the

 
 

motor housing has been set aside, the 2-ft-diam pump
casing can be withdrawn, carrying the upper bearing

and seal, the lower molten-salt-lubricated bearing, and
the impeller with it as a unit assembly. Although not

clearly evident in Figs. 5.6 and 5.8, the inlet salt pipe to

_ the pump is welded to the wall of the vessel surround-

ing the pump casing, and the 90° elbow, or inlet flow
guide on the inside of the casing, is an integral part of
the rotary element and is withdrawn with it. Main-
tenance of the drive motor and upper bearing and seal
assembly can probably be performed in place through
use of a static seal on the shaft to isolate the upper
assembly from gasborne fission products and other
contaminants in the pump tank and fuel salt system. -

5.4.3 Blanket Salt Circulating Pumps

There is little difference between the fuel salt and
blanket salt pumps except in the capacity and horse-

. power requirements, as shown in Table 5.4. The shafts

are about the same length, have the same bearing
arrangements, and the dynamic response is probably
similar.

5.4.4 Coolant Salt Circulating Pumps

The coolant salt pumps are similar to the fuel and
blanket salt pumps, although of larger capacity, as
indicated in Table 5.4."

The coolant salt pumps are located near the top of

the steam-generator cells and are of the short-shaft type

with an overhung impeller and do not need a salt- .

lubricated lower bearing. These pumps will be operated

at variable speeds over the range from about 300 to -

1200 rpm. Preliminary studies indicate that to operate
below the first critical speed the shaft would have to be
8 in. or more in diameter.

A double volute pump casing was selected for the
coolant salt pump in order to reduce the radial loads on
the impeller, particularly at off-design conditions. This
arrangement also reduces the diameter of the flexible
connection from the volute to the pump tank nozzle.
The coolant salt system would be provided with a tank
to act as a surge volume and to accommodate thermal
expansion of the coolant salt.

5.5 Off-Gas System

Fission product gases must be continuously removed
from the circulating fuel salt to prevent '35Xe from
absorbing so many neutrons that the breeding gain will
be significantly lowered. The neutron losses can be

greatly reduced by continuously sparging the salt with

-helium which, in its subsequent removal, carries away

the xenon and krypton. Both of these gases are only
slightly soluble in the salt. Xenon that diffuses into the
pores of the reactor core graphite must also be
considered. As discussed in Sect. 3.4, the amount of
xenon that diffuses depends on the ratio of the surface
area of helium bubbles in the circulating salt to the
surface area of graphite in the core, the rate of injection
and removal of bubbles, the coefficients for transfer of
xenon to both bubble and graphite surfaces, and the
permeability of the graphite to xenon. Assuming a
processing-cycle time of about 1 min and a graphite
coating effectiveness which reduces the permeability to

xenon as effectively as the preliminary tests indicate,

about 0.5 vol % of gas bubbles in the fuel salt in the
core will keep the !3%Xe poison fraction below 0.5%.

The major features of the off-gas system were
established, but only a few of the details were ex-
amined. The helium is injected into the circulating fuel

salt through a bubble generator at a rate of about 2.5 .

scfm per reactor module. The bubble generator is a
Venturi-like section of pipe capable of producing bub-
bles with diameters in the range of 15 to 20 mils. The
bubbles recirculate with the fuel salt, making, on the
average, about ten passes through the primary system
before being removed by means of a centrifugal
separator. Swirl vanes at the entrance to the separator

induce rotational flow in the liquid that causes en-

trained gas bubbles to collect in an axial vortex from
which the gas is withdrawn. Vanes at the exit of the
separator remove the swirl. :

The gas separator and bubble generator can be
installed in a bypass line around the fuel salt circulating
pump or in the main circulating system. In the former

location the bypass flow would have to be about 10%

of the total flow, the separator efficiency should be
near 100%, and a large pressure drop would be available
to operate the separator. If installed in the main stream,
the pressure drop that could be allotted to operation of
the separator would be much less, but the bubble
removal efficiency would only have to be about 10%.

- Effluent from the gas separator, composed of helium,

krypton, xenon, a “smoke” of noble metal fission
products, and as much as 50 vol % of salt, is delivered:
to an entrainment separator. There it is joined by a
second stream of about 0.5 scfm of gas that is used to
purge the fuel salt pump tank. The salt and gas are
separated, the salt is returned to the suction of the fuel
salt circulating pump, and the gas with its burden of
fission products and a small amount of salt mist is
discharged to a gas processing system that retains the

"
¥

»

xenon for about 48 hr — time enough for most of the
135Xe to decay — before it is recycled to the reactor.

Whether four, two, or one gas processing system
would be provided for a 1000-Mw(e) modular plant had
not been decided, but for the purposes of this discus-
sion we will assume that the gases from the four reactor
modules are combined and handled by one processing
system. The first part of the gas processing system is a
decay tank where the 12 scfm of gas is held for about 1
hr and most of the short-lived fission products release
their heat. In this tank the solid daughters of the
radioactive gases, the noble metal particles, and the salt
mist are separated from the gases by a particle trapping
system and are sent to the fuel reprocessing plant. Heat
is released in the decay tank and particle trap at a rate
of about 18 Mw, and care must be taken to provide
adequate cooling.

Gas leaving the 1-hr decay tank passes into beds of
charcoal that are designed to retain xenon for about 47
hr. These traps are water-cooled, and the heat load is
about 3.2 Mw. On leaving the charcoal beds, about 10
scfm of gas passes through a water monitor and trap to
a compressor that recirculates the gas to the bubble
generators in the reactor primary systems. The remain-
ing 2 scfm is processed further to remove the krypton,
xenon, and tritium, and the helium is recycled to the
pump tanks and to other parts of the reactor that
require clean gas.

5.6 Drain Tanks

5.6.1 General

Drain tanks are provided for the fuel, blanket, and
coolant salts so that they may be safely stored and
isolated when maintenance or reactor replacement is

49

required. Draining of the fuel salt is also a shutdown

measure in that the reactor quickly drains and becomes
subcritical if the fuel salt pump stops. In any situation
where heat generated in the primary system could not
be effectively removed via the coolant salt circuit, it

would be necessary to quickly drain the fuel salt into

the storage tank where an independent heat temoval
system is provided.>*

The volumes of salt to be stored were not firmly
established because of dependence on only tentative
plant layouts, but a rough estimate of the total storage
requirements is 1200 to 1400 ft* of fuel salt, 2000 to

33The reference literature sometimes refers to the storage

tanks as “dump tanks” because of the quick-drain feature in the

two-fluid MSBR.

2500 ft® of blanket salt, and 800 to 1000 ft of
coolant salt.
Two fuel salt tanks, four blanket salt tanks, and four

_ coolant salt tanks are provided for each reactor module.

These tanks are installed in a“ drain tank cell that is
shared by adjacent reactor modules, as shown in Fig.
4.6. In addition, a flush salt tank (see Sect. 5.6.5)
located in the same cell serves both reactor modules.
The drain tank cells are heated to maintain the salts
above the liquidus temperatures.

The fuel salt drain tank represents more of a design
problem than the other salt storage vessels and will be
discussed in greater detail. It may be noted that the fuel
salt drain tanks have many of the design requirements
of the reactor vessel itself in that the tanks must be
fabricated of Hastelloy N, are designed for essentially
the same pressures and temperatures, and must meet
the same requirements for leak-tightness and integrity.
In addition, each of the eight tanks must have sufficient
heat transfer surface for removing at least 12 Mw(t) of
heat from the drained fuel salt. Conceptual designs for
the drain tanks are presented here. Many details
remained to be examined.

5.6.2 Fuel Salt Drain Tanks

The two fuel salt drain tanks are connected together
at the bottom of a salt line provided with a freeze valve,
as indicated on the flowsheet, Fig. 4.5. The pump
overflow line enters the top of one tank, and the system
drain line enters the bottom of the other. By using two
tanks, pressurization can be used to return the salt to
the circulating system without need for a valve in the
pump overflow line. The volume of the heels left in the
tank is also reduced.

Each of the fuel salt drain tanks is about 5 ft in
diameter X 25 ft high, as shown in Fig. 5.9. Pertinent

-data are given in Table 5.5. The salt-containing portion

is about 19 ft 6 in. high and has % -in.-thick Hastelloy N
walls. The 1-in.-thick inverted dished bottom head is
designed to minimize the inventory of fuel salt in the
tank heel. The inside of the tank has a %-in.-thick liner,
or skirt, standing off from the wall about % in., which
acts as a. downcomer on filling the tank and as a riser
when gas pressurization is used to empty it. It may be
noted in Fig. 5.9 that the riser skirt communicates with
the tank only at the bottom of the heel. A drain line is
provided at the low point.

Steam at 500 to 600 psia and about 650°F is
introduced as a coolant at the top of the drain tank.
The steam enters through an 18-in.-diam reinforced
nozzle in the 1%-in.-thick top head. The steam then

circulates through 271 cooling thimbles which are
immersed in the fuel salt. The steam flows downward
through 1%-in.-OD X 0.025-in.-wall-thickness tubes
which are inside a 1%-in.-OD X 0.049-in.-wall-thick-
ness tube to form an annular passage through which
the steam returns upward to the steam chest at the top
of the tank.

Each thimble is encased in a 2-in.-OD X 0.035-in.-

wall-thickness thimble which provides the requisite

double containment between the fuel salt and the
steam. The 0.027-in. annular space between the inner
and outer thimbles is filled with a stagnant salt,
probably of about the same composition as the coolant
salt, which ‘acts as a heat transfer medium. While this
buffer space between the thimbles retards the heat

- transfer somewhat, it has the desirable effect of limiting

the thermal shock on the steam thimbles after a drain
and also of preventing excessive thermal gradients.

The exit steam chest is formed by the uppermost
2-in.-thick tube sheet and an inverted dished head about

3% in. thick. A third 1% -in.-thick tube sheet forms the

buffer space for the stagnant salt. A %-in.-thick heat
shield is suspended beneath the lower tube sheet to
protect it from thermal gradients and stresses when the
hot fuel salt enters the drain tank after a sudden drain.

Thimble support plates ¥ in. thick are suspended from .

the lower tube sheet to minimize vibrations induced in

"the thimbles by the flowing steam and to maintain the

spacing.
The two fuel salt tanks which serve a reactor module
are located in the deeper end of the drain tank cell, as

shown in Fig. 4.11, with one of the tanks at a higher

elevation than the other. The upper tank is the one
depicted in Fig. 5.9 and has a 5-in. salt drain line nozzle
at the top connected to the overflow from the fuel salt
circulating pump bowl. The drain tank at the lower
level does not require the 5-in. nozzle but is filled and
emptied through the 1-in. bottom drain connection.
This 1-in. line is connected through a freeze valve to the
bottom of the fuel salt primary heat exchanger.

The liquidus temperature of the fuel salt is about
842°F. Although there is little danger of the fuel salt
freezing once the reactor has operated at power,
nevertheless the cooling steam temperature cannot be
operated too far below the salt temperature if the
likelihood of local freezing of the salt is to be avoided.
Of greater concern are the temperature gradients in the
tube walls and tube sheets if the differences in
temperature ‘between the salt and the steam are too
great. The cooling steam has been assumed to be
admitted at about 650°F. The source of the 650°F
steam has not been fully studied, but presumably it
could be taken from the exit of the reheat steam
preheaters in the turbine plant.

The cooling steam in the drain tanks could be heated
to as high as about 1000°F in the thimbles by the
conditions existing immediately after a drain following
long-term operation at full reactor power. The steam
would be condensed in the turbine condensers, and the
condensate would be returned to the feedwater system.
In this two-fluid MSBR concept other reactor modules
could continue to operate even though one or more of
the reactors had been drained. In the event that all the
reactors were drained, cooling steam would be supplied
by the auxiliary boiler which is used to supply initial
warmup steam for the plant.

The heat generation in the fuel salt after a drain from
the reactor was investigated by Carter.>4 He considered
both the equilibrium concentrations of fission products
with no sparging of krypton and xenon during reactor
operation and the concentrations of fission products if
these gases were sparged from the reactor system on a
30-sec cycle. The results are shown in Table 5.6.

"The heat transfer to be expected in the drain tank was
studied by Pickel.?® The results are summarized in
Table 5.5. Preliminary investigation of the stresses
indicated that they were within allowable limits. A
complete analysis of the vessel was not made, however.

. Use of air rather than steam as a coolant was also

briefly investigated.

5.6.3 Blanket Salt Drain Tanks

A total of 16 drain tanks was selected to store the
estimated 2000 to 2500 ft> of blanket salt. This
provides four blanket salt tanks per module.

35ST. W. Pickel, Heat Removal from (MSBR) Fuel Dump
Tanks, ORNL-MSR-67-72 (Sept. 6, 1967).
 

 

The amount of heat that could be generated in the
blanket salt after an emergency drain to the storage
tanks was not calculated, but the preliminary assump-
tion was that no cooling thimbles would be needed in
the tanks. If required, a steam cooling system similar to
that used in the fuel salt tanks would be provided.

5.6.4 Coolant Salt Drain Tanks

The layouts of coolant salt piping were not suf-
ficiently detailed to estimate the quantity of coolant
salt in the systems. A rough estimate of the storage
capacity required was 800 to 1000 ft3, but this is likely
to be low. Four coolant salt tanks were provided per
reactor module.

The coolant salt tanks would not require cooling
systems.

5.6.5 Flush Salt Drain Tanks

A flush salt is provided for removal of residual fuel
salt from the circulating system in order to lower the
radioactivity level during maintenance and to assure
more complete ‘recovery of valuable constituents. On
startup, the flush salt would be circulated in the

53

systems to sweep out foreign materials, moisture, etc.,

before introducing the enriched salts. The composition
of the flush salt would be very similar to the ?LiF-
BeF, fuel carrier salt. The volumes required and the
tank sizes were not established.

5.7 Steam Generators

The 1000-Mw(e) MSBR power station described in this
report requires about 10 X 10° Ib/hr of total steam
generation. This is divided between ‘16 steam gen-
erators, or 4 steam generators per module. The number
of units was selected on the basis that the high (3800
psia) design pressure on the steam side made larger

capacity units appear to have disproportionately thick -

heads and tube sheets. Maintenance aspects also favored
selection of a multiplicity of units since the generators

module. Load regulation and partial-load operation
received only superficial investigation.

- As shown in Fig. 5.10 the steam generator is a vertical
shell-and-tube unit with counterflow between the once-
through passage of the supercritical pressure water in
the tubes and the coolant salt in the baffled shell space.
The generator has a U-shaped cylindrical shell about 18
in. in diameter with each leg standing about 34 ft high,
including the spherical head. A baffle on the shell side
of each tube sheet provides a stagnant layer to help
reduce the stresses in the sheet due to temperature
gradients. The coolant salt can be -drained from the
shell, but the water would have to be removed from the
tubes by evaporation, by gas pressurization, or by
flushing. (Drainability of the water was considered
desirable but not mandatory.) Both the tubes and shell
are fabricated of Hastelloy N in this design concept, but
less-expensive materials might be acceptable.

The principal data for the steam generators are listed
in Table 5.7.The design variables to be determined were .
the number of tubes, the tube pitch, length of tubes,
thickness of tube wall, thickness of tube sheet, baffle
size and spacing, diameter of shell, thickness of shell,
and thickness and shape of the heads. Because of the
marked changes in the physical properties of water as
its temperature is increased above the critical point at
supercritical pressures, the temperature driving force
and the heat transfer coefficient varied markedly along
the length of the tubes. These conditions required that
the heat transfer and pressure drop be calculated for
increments of length. An iterative procedure was
programmed for the CDC 1604 computer, as described
in ORNL-TM-1545.2% Based on the coolant salt prop-
erties given in Table 3.1, the optimum design was
calculated to have a long slim shell and relatively wide
baffle spacing as shown in Fig. 5.10. Subsequently the
thermal conductivity of the coolant salt was found to
be substantially less than had been used in the
calculations. Use of the lower thermal conductivity
could be expected to increase the number and length of

“tubes and to increase the shell diameter by a small.

as designed are not easily repaired and replacement of -

_ entire units could be required.

The coolant salt flow is proportioned between the
steam generators and the reheaters as necessary to
obtain a 1000°F outlet steam temperature from each.
About 87% of the total coolant salt flow is required for
the steam generators. The coolant salt is cooled from
about 1150 to 850°F in the units. Flow control is
accomplished either by a regulating valve in the salt
line, as indicated in Fig. 4.5, or by use of two
variable-speed coolant salt circulating pumps per

"amount.

5.8 Steam Reheaters

A single-reheat power cycle was selected for the
MSBR plant although additional stages of reheat could
be provided should this prove to be economically

the reheaters without the likelihood of local freezing of
the coolant salt. The steam is therefore preheated by
use of prime steam. (See Sect. 5.9 for a description of
the preheaters.) The preheated steam, at about 650°F
and 570 psia, is then reheated to 1000°F in the steam
reheaters. About 13% of the total reactor heat output is
used for steam reheating in a total of eight units, or two
per module. Selection of the number of units was
largely intuitive because optimization studies had not
commenced.

The reheater units are counterflow, vertical, shell
and-tube exchangers with straight tubes containing the
steam and coolant salt flowing through the disk and
doughnut baffles on the shell side. Tubes and shell are
constructed of Hastelloy N. The principal data are listed
in Table 5.8, and the unit is pictured in Fig. 5.11.

The methods used in the calculations of the heat
transfer and stresses are much the same as those used
for the steam generator and are described in detail in

5.9 Reheat Steam Preheaters

Steam at turbine throttle conditions of 3500 psia and
1000°F is used to preheat the reheat steam from 552 to
650°F before it enters the reheaters. The eight pre-
heaters, two per module, are single-pass, counterflow,
U-tube, U-shell units with the supercritical-pressure
steam in the tubes and the reheat steam in the
unbaffled shell, as shown in Fig. 5.12. Selection of a U
shell rather than a divided cylindrical shell permits
smaller diameters for the heads and reduces the
thickness required for the heads and tube sheets.

- Principal data are given in Table 5.9. The heat transfer

and stress calculations are covered in ORNL-
TM-1545.28

The preheaters are more a part of the turbine plant
than the reactor plant and need not be installed in a

shielded cell nor necessarily manifolded in conformity

with the modular arrangement adopted for the reactor
plant. Two preheaters have been shown associated with
each reactor module, however, primarily as a matter of
convenience in the layout.

5.10 Maintenance

Maintenance is a major subject for consideration in
the design of any fluid fuel reactor, and it is discussed
briefly here only because the two-fluid MSBR con-
ceptual studies were discontinued before maintenance
procedures could be considered in detail. It was,
however, recognized throughout the design effort that
it must be possible to repair or replace system com-
ponents within a reasonable downtime for the plant,
and this requirement influenced much of the design.
Even though the systems containing fuel salt are
drained and flushed, the residual radioactivity will
require that all maintenance be accomplished by re-
motely operated tools. and equipment. The off-gas
systems will also require remote maintenance. On the
other hand, most of the coolant salt system com-
ponents can probably be approached for direct main-

* tenance after flushing and elapse of a short decay time.

Little or no radioactivity should be present in the steam
and feedwater systems even during full-power opera-
tion.

As mentioned in Sect. 2, the radiation damage to
graphite will make it necessary to replace the reactor
core vessel several times during the lifetime of the plant.
Since the two-fluid MSBR concept does not lend itself
to use of a removable top cover for the reactor vessel to
gain access for replacement of the core graphite, it was
decided that use of four small reactors or modules, with
replacement of an entire reactor vessel and core

 
 

 

 

assembly, would be more practical than in-place main-
tenance of a single, larger reactor. Replacement of a
module would require cutting of the salt piping and
withdrawal of the assembly upward into a shielded

transport cask for transfer of the spent unit into a

shielded pit for decay and ultimate disposal. A shop-

- assembled and -tested replacement module would be

standing by. The salt-piping stubs would be previously
machined for welding through use of a jig which
matches the installed piping system.

If a major tube leak should occur in the primary heat
exchanger, it would be necessary to replace the entire
heat-exchanger—pump assembly. The procedure would
be to cut the large fuel salt pipes and the two inlet
coolant salt pipes, to cut the seal welds, and unbolt the
large flange at the bottom of the shell. The exchanger
could then be lifted from the cell, disengaging the
central coolant salt pipe at the slip joint provided for

this purpose. Drain, fill and drain, gas pressurization,

and several other connections must also be cut when
removing the exchanger.

The rotating parts of the fuel salt circulating pump
can be withdrawn upward after the drive motor has
been set aside. This is a relatively simple operation that

~ does not require breaking the: salt piping connections.

The type of maintenance of a large MSBR reactor
plant described here requires the cutting and welding of
salt piping by remote means. Some original work by the
Air Force has been modified and is being developed by
Holz®¢ at ORNL to provide this capability. A compact
orbital system is designed to be clamped around the
pipe and has interchangeable modules and a weld
programmer for cutting, beveling, tungsten-arc welding,

and inspection. Preliminary tests have produced welds
of acceptable quality in 6- and 8-in.-diam pipes with
fully remote operation.

Much valuable experience has been gained at the
MSRE with remote maintenance operations similar to
those required for a larger molten-salt reactor. The use
of jigs and optical tooling has proven to be a practical
and expeditious method of fitting replacement parts
and components into the existing system.

The first. cost of the special equipment required for
maintenance operations is a part of the capital cost of
the plant. This has been included in Table 7.1 as an
allowance, since conceptual designs for the equipment
were not available. The cost of the materials used in
replacement of reactor modules and the special labor

. forces required are included in the power production

cost as a separate item (see Table 7.2). (Some may wish
to include this expense with the fuel-cycle cost; others
may consider it to be an operating cost.)

Welding for Nuclear Plant Maintenance, ORNL-TM-2712 (No-

6. REACTOR PHYSICS AND FUEL
CYCLE ANALYSIS

6.1 Optimization of Reactor Parameters

In addition to the so-called conservation coefficient
discussed in Sect. 2, which relates specific inventory
and breeding gain, two other principal indices by which
the performance of a molten-salt breeder reactor can be
evaluated are the cost of power and the annual fuel
~ yield, The latter two indices were used as figures of
merit in assessing the influence of various design
parameters and the effect of design changes on the
two-fluid MSBR.

We customarily combine the cost factor and the fuel

yield, that is, the annual fractional increase in the
inventory of fissionable material, into a composite
* figure of merit

F=y+100(C+X)™",

_ in which y is the annual fuel yield in percent per year, C
is that part of the power cost which depends on any of
the parameters considered, and X is an adjustable

- constant, having no physical significance, whose value
merely determines the relative sensitivity of F toy and
C. Since a large number of reactor parameters are
involved, we make use of an automatic search pro-
cedure, carried out on a computer, which finds that
combination of the variable design parameters that
maximizes the figure of merit F subject to whatever
constraints may be imposed by the fixed values of other
design parameters. This procedure, called
OPTIMERC,>” incorporates a multigroup diffusion
calculation (synthesizing a two-space-dimensional de-
scription of the flux by alternating one-dimensional
flux calculations), a determination of the fissile, fertile,
and fission product concentrations consistent with the
processing rates of the fuel and fertile salt streams, and
a method of steepest gradients for optimizing the values
of the variables. By choosing different values for the
constant X in the figure of merit F, we can generate a
curve showing the minimum cost associated with any
attainable value of the fuel yield. By carrying out the
optimization procedure for different successive fixed
values of selected design parameters, we obtain families
of curves of C as a function of y.

One of the design parameters which has. a significant
influence on both yield and power cost is the power

37In OPTIMERC any of some 20 parameters may be either -

assigned fixed values or be allowed to vary within specified
limits subject to the optimization procedure.

density in the core. The performance of the reactor is
better at high power densities. At the same time, the

useful life of the graphite moderator, which is de-

pendent on the total exposure to fast neutrons, is
inversely proportional to the power density (see Table
5.1 and Sect. 6.2). It is necessary, therefore, to
determine the effect of power density on performance
with considerable care.

In Fig. 6.1 the fuelcycle cost is used because it
reflects most of the variations of power cost due to the
influences of the parameters being varied. It may be

seen from Fig. 6.1 that a reduction in average power

density from 80 to 20 w/cm® involves a fuel-cycle cost
penalty of about 0.1 mill/kwhr(e) and a reduction in
annual fuel yield of perhaps 1.5%. There is an increase
in the capital cost of the reactor, but this is offset

somewhat by a reduction in the cost of replacing the:
~ graphite (and the reactor vessel) since this can be done

at less frequent intervals. The penalty for having to
replace the graphite (compared with a high-power-
density core not requiring replacement) is about 0.2
mill/kwhr(e). The capital cost portion increases and the
replacement cost portion decreases with decreasing
power density so that the total remains about constant.

Figures 6.2 and 6.3 show the variation of other selected
parameters with power density and the adjustable
constant X. For given values of power density and X,
the corresponding values of the selected parameters are
those of the reactor with the optimum combination of
yield and fuel-cycle cost.

It is apparent from these results that the useful life of
the graphite is not increased by reducing core power
density without some sacrifice in other aspects of

“reactor performance. The reduction in yield and the

increase in cost are quite modest for a reduction of
power density from 80 to 40 w/cm?®, but they become
increasingly more significant for each further factor of
2 reduction in power density. Nonetheless, as shown in

_ Fig. 6.1, it appears that with an average power density

as low as 20 w/cm® the MSBR can still achieve an
annual fuel yield of 3.5 to 4% and a fuel-cycle cost of
about 0.5 mill/kwhr(e).

The fuel-cycle cost estimate for the 40-w/cm con-
figuration summarized in Fig. 6.1 is shown in more
detail in Tables 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4. The economic
ground rules for the fuel-cycle cost calculations are
given in Table 6.1. The worth of the fissile isotopes was

3

‘taken from the AEC price schedules. The capital
changes of 13.7%/year for depreciating items and
10%/year for nondepreciating materials are typical of
‘those for privately owned plants under 1968 condi-
tions, as shown in Appendix Table A.12.

Results of the fuel-cycle calculations for the MSBR
design are summarized in Table 6.2, and the neutron
balance is given in Table 6.3. The reactor has the

The fuel-cycle costs for fixed charges on processing
equipment are based on cost estimates published in
ORNL-3996, but escalated by 10% to 1968 conditions.
The operating costs for labor and plant supplies (other
than ‘salt inventories and makeup) specifically related to
the chemical processing portion of the power station

“are also based on the ORNL-3996 estimate with 10%

escalation, as shown in Table 6.4.

It may be noted in Table 6.4 that the main cost items
are for the fissile inventory and the processing costs.
The inventory costs are rather rigid for a given reactor
design, since they are largely determined by the fuel
volume external to the reactor core region. The

is 2.16 times the equivalent Pluto dose. From an
inspection of all the available data, we concluded that a
dose of about 2.5 X 1022 neutrons/cm® (equivalent

~ Pluto dose) could be sustained without any significant

deterioration of the physical properties of the graphite.
This was adopted as the allowable dose in these MSBR
studies,’
mechanical design problems that might be associated
with dimensional changes in the graphite.

In order to interpret these experiments to obtain
predictions of graphite damage vs time in the molten-
salt reactor, it is necessary to take into account the
difference between the neutron spectrum in the DFR
and in the MSBR. This, in turn, requires assumptions

64

regarding the effectiveness of neutrons of different
energies for producing the observable effects with
which one is concerned. At present the best approach
available is to base the estimates of neutron damage
effectiveness on the theoretical calculations of graphite
lattice displacements vs carbon recoil energy carried out
by Thompson and Wright.3® Their “damage function”
is integrated over the .distribution of carbon recoil
energies resulting from the scattering of a neutron of a

~ given energy, and the result is then multiplied by the

energy-dependent scattering cross section and inte-
grated over the neutron spectrum in the reactor. Tests
of the model were made by Thompson and Wright by
calculating the rate of electrical resistivity change in
graphite relative to the S®Ni(n,p)°®Co reaction, in
different reactor spectra, and the data were compared
with experimental determinations of the same quanti-
ties. The results indicate that the model is at least useful
for predicting relative damage rates in different spectra.
The spectral effects are discussed more fully by Perry i in
ORNL-TM-2136.'? :

A useful simplification arises from the observation
that the damage per unit time is closely proportional to
the total neutron flux above some energy Eo, where E,
has the same value for widely different reactor spectra.
We have reconfirmed this observation to our own"
satisfaction by comparing the calculated damage per
unit flux above energy Eo, as a function of E, for

. spectra appropriate to three different moderators (H,0

pending further detailed consideration of -

D, 0, and C) and for a “typical” fast reactor spectrum.
The results plotted in Fig. 6.5 show that the flux above
about 50 kev is a reliable indication of the relative
damage rate in graphite for quite different spectra.
Figure 6.6 shows the spectra for which these results
were derived. The equivalence between MSBR and DFR
experiments is found by equating the doses due to
neutrons above 50 kev in the two reactors. We have not’
yet calculated the DFR spectrum explicitly, but we
expect it to be similar to the “fast reactor” spectrum of
Fig. 6.6, in which 94% of the total flux lies above 50

‘kev. Since the damage flux in the MSBR is essentially

proportional to the local power density, we postulate
that the useful life of the graphite is governed by the
maximum power density rather than by the average,
and thus depends on the degree of power flattening that
can be achieved (see Sect. 6.3). In the two-fluid MSBR
the average flux above 50 kev is about 0.94 X 10'¢

neutrons cm sec”! at a power density of 20 w/cm®.

63 Flux Flattening

Because the useful life of the graphite moderator in
the MSBR depends on the maximum value of the
damage flux rather than on its average value in the core,
there is obviously an incentive to reduce the maximum-
to-average flux ratio as much as possible, provided that
this can be accomplished without serious penalty to
other aspects of the reactor performance. In addition,
there is an incentive to make the temperature rise in
parallel fuel passages through the core as nearly uniform
as possible, or at least to minimize the maximum
deviation of fuel outlet temperature from the average

* value, Since the damage flux (in effect, the total
neutron flux above 50 kev) is essentially proportional
to the fission density per unit of core volume, the first
incentive requires an attempt to flatten the power
“density per unit core volume throughout the core, that
is, in both radial and axial directions. Since the fuel
moves through the core only in the axial direction, the
second incentive requires an attempt to flatten, in the

radial direction, the power density per unit volume of
fuel. Both objectives can be accomplished by main-
taining a uniform volume fraction of fuel salt through-

out the core and by flattening the power density

distribution ‘in both directions to the greatest extent
possible.
The general approach taken to flattening the power
distribution is the classical one of providing a central
core zone with k_ = 1, that is, one which is neither a -
net producer noir a net absorber of neutrons, sur-
rounded by a “buckled” zone whose surplus neutron
production just compensates for the neutron leakage
through the core boundary. Since the fuel salt volume
fraction is to be kept uniform throughout the core and
since the concentrations of both the fuel and the fertile
salt streams are uniform throughout their respective
circuits, the principal remaining parameter that can be
varied with position in the core to achieve the desired
effects is the fertile salt volume fraction. The problem
then reduces to finding the value of the fertile salt
volume fraction that gives k, = 1 for the central,
 

 

flattened zone, with fixed values of the other param-.

eters, and finding the volume fraction of the fertile salt
in the buckled zone that makes the reactor critical for
different sizes of the flattened zone. As the fraction of
the core volume occupied by the flattened zone is
increased, the fertile salt fraction in the buckled zone
must be decreased, and the peak-to-average power
density ratio decreases toward unity. The largest flat-
tened zone and the smallest power density ratio are
achieved when the fertile material is removed entirely
from "the outer core zone. Increasing the fuel salt
concentration or its volume fraction (with an appropri-
ate adjustment of the fertile salt volume fraction in the
flattened zone) would permit a still larger flattened
zone and smaller Py, /P,,, but this could be expected
to compromise the reactor performance by increasing
the fuel inventory.

There are many possible combinations of parameters
to consider. For example, it is not obvious, a priori,
whether the flattened zone should have the same
height-to-diameter ratio as the entire core, or whether
the axial buckled zones should have the same composi-
tion as the radial buckled zone. While we have by no
means completed investigations in this area, we have
progressed far enough to recognize several important
aspects.

First, by flattening the power to various degrees in
the radial direction only and performing fuel-cycle and
economic calculations for each of these cases, we find
that the radial power distribution can be markedly
flattened with very little effect on fuel cost or on
annual fuel yield. That is, the radial peak-to-average

power density ratio, which is about 2.0 for the uniform

core (which is surrounded by a heavily absorbing

blanket region and hence behaves essentially as if it

were unreflected), can be reduced to 1.25 or less with
changes in fuel cost and yield of less than 0.02
mill’kwhr(e) and 0.2% per year respectively. The
enhanced neutron leakage from the core, which results
from the power flattening, is taken up by the fertile

blanket and does not represent a loss in breeding

performance.

Second, attempts at power flattening in two dimen-
sions have shown that the power distribution is very
sensitive to details of composition and placement of the
flattened zone. Small differences in upper and lower
blanket composition, which are of no consequence in
the case of the uniform core, produce pronounced axial
asymmetry of the power distribution if too much axial
flattening is attempted. In addition, the axial and radial
buckled zones may interact through the flattened zone

to some extent, giving a distribution that is concave

67

upward in one direction and coricave downward in the
other, even though the integrated neutron current over
the entire boundary of the central zone vanishes. In
view of these tendencies, it may be anticipated that a
flattened power distribution would be difficult to
maintain if graphite dimensional changes, resulting from
exposure to fast neutrons, were allowed to influence
the salt volume fractions very strongly. Consequently, a

core of the design shown in Fig. 5.4 was under

consideration as a means of reducing the sensitivity of

the power distribution to graphite dimensional changes.

6.4 Fuel Cell Calculations

A series of calculations was performed to investigate

the nuclear characteristics of the two-fluid MSBR fuel

cells, or elements. These were based on the geometry
shown in Fig. 6.7. (Subsequent to these calculations, a
graphite sleeve was added around the fertile salt.)

The cell calculations were performed with the code
TONG and involved varying (1) cell diameter, (2) fuel
distribution (i.e., fuel separation distance), (3) 233U
concentration, (4) 222Th concentration, (5) fuel salt
volume fraction, and (6) fertile salt volume fraction.
Each of these parameters was varied separately while
holding the others constant. Figure 6.8 shows the effect
on reactivity of varying the parameters. The variations
are shown relative to a reference cell which had a

- diameter of 3 in., a fuel separation distance of % in., a

fuel salt fraction of 0.1648, and a fertile salt fraction of
0.0585, with ~0.2 mole % 2>3UF, in the fuel salt and
27 mole % ThF, in the fertile salt.

These calculations showed that as the cell diameter
increases, the increased self-shielding of the 232Th
resonances leads to an increase in the reactivity of the
cell. Thus a decrease in breeding ratio associated with
the decreased *22Th resonance integral is accompanied

by a decrease in the required 233U loading. Optimiza-
tion calculations using cross sections based on 3- and

S-in.-diam cells indicated that the annual fuel yield of

the system is essentially insensitive to fuel cell diam-
eters between 3 and 5 in. This is significant because the
larger cells are preferred for hydrodynamic reasons,

particularly in order to achieve the desired Reynolds:

numbers for the fuel salt flow in the channels.

Table 6.7 and Fig. 6.9 show the flux distribution in
the S-in.-diam- cell. Table 6.7 gives the ratio of the
average flux in the fuel to the cell average flux, the ratio
of the average flux in the graphite to the cell average
flux, and the ratio of the average flux in the fertile salt
to the cell average flux for the epithermal and fast flux
ranges. Figure 6.9 shows the thermal flux distribution
in the cell.

Two-dimensional diffusion-theory calculations indi-
cated that the central cell of the reactor may be useful
for control purposes. For example, if the central cell is
a 5-n.-OD X 4-in-ID graphite tube and if this com-
pletely empty tube is filled with fertile salt, the change

"in reactivity is 8k/k = —0.018%. If the empty tube is

filled with graphite, the reactivity change is 8k/k =
+0.0012%. Thus there appears to be a substantial
amount of reactivity control available by varying the
height of the fertile column in the tubes, which might

be accomplished through use of a movable graphite

plug.

6.5 Temperature Coefficients of Reactivity

In analyzing power transients in the two-fluid MSBR,

one must be able to determine the reactivity effects of

temperature changes in the fuel salt, the fertile salt, and
the graphite moderator. Since the fuel is also the
coolant and since only small fractions of the total heat
are generated in the fertile salt and in the moderator,
one expects very much smaller temperature changes in

the latter components than in the fuel during a power -
transient. Expansion of the fuel salt, which removes

“fuel from the active core, is thus the principal inherent
mechanism for compensating any reactivity additions.

We accordingly calculated the magnitudes of the
temperature coefficients of reactivity separately for the
fuel salt, the fertile salt, and the graphite over the range

of temperatures from 800 to 1000°K. The results of
these calculations, as shown in Fig. 6.10a, illustrate the
change in multiplication factor vs moderator tempera-
ture (with 8k arbitrarily set equal to zero at 900°K).
Similar curves of 6k vs temperature for fuel and fertile
salts are shown in Figs. 6.10b and 6.10c, and the
combined effects are shown in Fig. 6.10d. All these
curves are nearly linear, the slopes being the tempera-
ture coefficients of reactivity. The magnitudes of the
coefficients at 900°K are shown in Table 6.8.

The moderator coefficient comes almost entirely
from changes in the spectrum-averaged cross sections. It
is particularly worthy of note that the moderator
coefficient appears to be quite insensitive to uncer-
tainties in the energy dependence of the 233U cross
sections in the energy range below 1 ev. This is to say
that reasonable choices of cross sections based on
available experimental data yield essentially the same
coefficient. So

The fertile salt reactivity coefficient comprises a
strong positive component due to salt expansion (and
hence reduction in the number of fertile atoms per unit
core volume) and an appreciable negative component
due to temperature dependence of the effective
resonance-absorption. cross sections, so that the overall
coefficient, though positive, is less than half as large as
- that due to salt expansion alone.

The fuel salt coefficient is due mainly to expansion of
the salt, which of course reduces the average density of
fuel in the core. Even if all core components were to
undergo equal temperature changes, the fuel salt coeffi-
cient would dominate. In transients in which the fuel

6.6 Dynamics Analysis

The dynamic behavior of the MSBR, particularly the
reactor stability, was investigated using a linearized

model of the two-fluid system. The model included a

lumped parameter representation of the neutronics
(including pure time delays for out-of-core precursor
transport), fuel salt heat transfer in the core, fertile salt

. heat transfer in the core, fuel salt heat exchanger, and

the salt side of the boiler and reheater. The heat
removal from the boiler and reheater was assumed
constant. The resulting model consisted of 34 coupled
differential equations with 15 pure time delays.

The estimates of the temperature coefficients of
reactivity for the fuel salt, fertile salt, and graphite were
revised during the course of these dynamics calcula-
tions. Some of the calculations were based on the early
values and some were based on the later ones. Both
values are shown in Table 6.9. The neutron generation
time was 3.3 X 10™* sec.

The model was used for analyses of system stability,
transient response, and frequency response. The sta-
bility analysis (using the newer temperature coefficients
in Table 6.9) was accomplished by employing the
modified Mikhailov method described by Wright.*! The
analysis showed that the system is linearly stable.

The stability of the system is also indicated by the
response of the system to step changes in reactivity.
The linearized response of the reactor power to a step
change of 10™* Ak/k is shown in Fig. 6.11. This curve
is based on the old reactivity coefficients given in
Table 6.9. Since the model is linear, the response to
some other reactivity step is the product of the
computed response and the ratio of the new reactivity

not valid for large reactivity inputs, but would be
sufficiently -accurate for transients in which the power

~ changes by less than 10%. The response shown in Fig.

6.11 is expressed as the deviation from the full-power
output [556 Mw(t)] of a single reactor module.

The power-to-reactivity frequency response: of the
reactor is shown in Figs. 6.12 and 6.13 for the case of
full-power operation. In this instarice the results are
based on the newer reactivity coefficients given in
Table 6.9. As would be expected from the transient re-
sponse results, there are no tall peaks in the frequency
response amplitude which would indicate strong reso-
nance behavior. The frequency response was also com-
puted using the old reactivity coefficients. Since the

change in the results was very small, the transient

response calculations were not repeated.

7. COST ESTIMATES
7.1 General

One of the promising aspects of the molten-salt
breeder reactor is the potential for producing low-cost
power. At the present stage of development, accurate
detailed cost estimates are not possible, but our best.
estimate of the construction cost of a two-fluid
1000-Mw(e) MSBR station is about $140/kw(e). This
estimate is in terms of early 1968 conditions and value
of the dollar, and includes indiréct costs. The estimated

71

net cost to produce power with private ownership of
the plant is about 4 milis/kwhr.

In making the cost estimates we assumed that an
established molten-salt reactor industry exists and that
materials are being supplied and plants are being
constructed and licensed on a routine basis. We also
assumed that the indirect charges, or owner’s costs, for
a molten-salt reactor are not significantly different from
those for other types of reactors.

Although the chemical reprocessing plant is part of
the reactor station, not all the chemical plant costs are -
included in the estimate of the station construction
cost. The cost of the shielded cells to house the
chemical plant is included in the overall structures
account for the reactor plant, but the cost of the
processing equipment, the fuel and blanket salt inven-
tories, and the operation of the chemical plant was kept
separate from the rest of the station costs in order to
arrive at a fuel cycle cost which is comparable with the
fuel cycle costs for other types of nuclear power
stations. The estimated fuel cycle cost is about 0.5
mill/kwhr, or about 0.7 mill/kwhr if the expense of
periodic replacement of the reactor vessels and graphite
cores is included. This is lower than has been projected

for most other types of nuclear power plants and

accounts for much of the interest in molten-salt
reactors. }

The costs reported here for the two-fluid MSBR are
higher than those published in ORNL-3996' in 1966.
This is primarily because of changes in the plant
‘concept, modifications to the design due to revisions in
the physical properties data, and escalation of costs
between 1966 and 1968. The present estimate of the
direct construction cost is. about the same as the
estimated cost for a pressurized-water reactor of
1000-Mw(e) size built on the same site. Because the
accuracy of the estimates is uncertain, we think the
major value is in comparing MSBR and PWR costs to
learn where the inherent differences in the systems have
an important bearing on the relative costs of the two
kinds of plants. Two areas stand out: The allowance for
maintenance is less on the PWR, but the cost of the
turbine-generator is less for the MSBR.

. 7.2 Construction Costs

The estimate of the construction cost of a two-fluid
1000Mw(e) MSBR power station is summarized in
Table 7.1. Tables A.1 through A.11 in the appendix
give more -details of the costs. About half the total
construction cost is for conventional parts of the plant,
such as structures, turbine-generator, etc., for which

DPWR costs taken from J. A. Lane, M. L. Myers, and R. C. Olson, Power Plant Capital Cost
Normalization, ORNL-TM-2385 (June 1969), plus 4% escalation for the 1968 dollar. Since the
costs in the Lane study were based on the 1967 value of the dollar, they were escalated by 4% to
more closely approximate 1968 conditions. The PWR indirect costs used in the study were not
used in the two-fluid MSBR estimate shown in Table 7.1 because they were not on the same basis.
For simplicity, the same value for indirect costs of 33.5% was applied to the direct construction
cost of both the MSBR and PWR. A sales tax of 3% was added to the construction cost of both

types of plants,

costs are relatively well established. The reactor-
associated costs are less certain because of the pre-
liminary nature of the designs and the use of special
graphite and Hastelloy N for which there is no
experience in large-scale production and fabrication.
With regard to the graphite, a long-term cost of $5/1b
(see Table A.3) was used in these estimates. More recent

studies by Cook et al.*? suggest that the price could

approach $8/Ib. Installed tosts of Hastelloy N com-

Core Graphite Cost, ORNL internal correspondence

ponents were assumed to vary between $8 and $20/Ib,
depending upon the form of the Hasteloy N and
complexity of construction, as shown in Table A.2.

A few of the items listed in Table 7.1, such as

maintenance equipment, are subject to considerable -

uncertainty because little design work was completed in
those areas. A study by Blumberg? indicated that
about $5 million should be allowed for maintenance
equipment for the MSBR station.

"The comparative costs shown in Table 7.1 for a PWR
station were taken from the normalization studies by
Lane ef al.** The MSBR and PWR costs are about equal
in many areas, but in at least two instances the
differences are worthy of note:

1. The maintenance equipment required for replace-
ment of the reactor vessels in the MSBR station is
included as a capital expense. This allowance is con-

_ siderably higher than corresponding PWR costs. The

replacement costs in terms of the materials and special
labor required were handled separately, as discussed in
Sect. 7.3. :

2. The cost of the turbine-generator and associated
turbine - plant equipment is much less for the MSBR
station because it operates at about 45% thermal
efficiency, as compared with the 33% thermal effi-
ciency of the PWR, and ‘it uses supercritical-pressure

steam rather than the low-pressure steam of the water

reactor plant.

73 Power Production Costs

The total cost to produce electric power in a privately
owned ' 1000-Mw(e) two-fluid MSBR station is esti-

mated to be about 4 mills/kwhr. The costs are

summarized in Table 7.2. The fuel -cycle cost ‘is
sufficiently low that even the addition of the expense
of periodically replacing reactor vessels and graphite
results in a combined cost of only about 0.7 mill/kwhr.
The net cost of about 4 mills/kwhr to produce
electricity is attractively low.

The fixed charge of 13.7% used in making the
estimates is explained in Table A.12 in the appendix. In
estimating the depreciation allowance, a 30-year plant
life was assumed in order to be consistent with other
reactor evaluation studies. The possibility that the low
fuel cycle cost and higher thermal efficiency would
make the useful life of an MSBR considerably greater
than 30 years was considered. An increase in plant life
to 45 years would produce a net reduction in the power

44PWR costs taken from J. A. Lane, M. L. Myers, and R. C.
Olson, - Power Plant Capital Cost Normalization, ORNL-TM-
2385 (June 1969), plus 4% escalation for the 1968 dollar. Since
the costs in the Lane study were based on the 1967 value of the
dollar, they were escalated by 4% to more closely approximate

- 1968 conditions. The PWR indirect costs used in the study were

not used in the two-fluid MSBR estimate shown in Table 7.1
because they were not on the same basis. For simplicity, the
same value for indirect costs of 33.5% was applied to the direct
construction cost of both the MSBR and PWR. A sales tax of
3% was added to the construction cost of both types of plants.

A.12, and a plant factor of 80%.

production cost of a little less than 0.1 mill/kwhr, as
explained in footnote b of Table A.12.

In applying the fixed charge, no distinction was made
between depreciating and nondepreciating capital in-
vestment except for the inventory components of the
fuel cycle cost. Such a refinement to the estimate
would be overshadowed by uncertainties in other costs.
The salvage value of many of the items is not clear; the

- costs of decontaminating and reclaiming such things as

land, salt inventory, etc., must be balanced against the
intrinsic worth and the expense of disposal that would
otherwise be required.

The estimate of the cost of replacing the reactor
vessels at the end of the useful life of the graphite cores
is summarized in Table A.13. As explained in the

- footnotes to the table, an indirect cost of 10% was

applied to the procurement of the replacement reactors.
Many of the indirect costs of first construction would
not ‘be applicable to the replacement equipment. The
lifetime of the core is such that the replacements can be
made during periods of extensive general maintenance
of the plant and turbine generators, so no outage other
than that included in the 80% plant factor was charged
against the production cost. This seemed to be a
reasonable approach since no downtime is required for
refueling. If additional time were required for replacing
the reactor vessels, .the cost of power would be
increased by about 0.05 mill/kwhr for each two weeks
of extra time.%5 .

Labor costs in addition to those for the regular plant

-maintenance crew were included in the reactor replace-

ment expenses. Allowance was made for a special crew
of 18 men at $10/hr on a three-shift basis over a
two-month period. This time would include preparatory
and cleanup operations. The total cost of the special
labor amounts to $300,000. Scheduling of the replace-
ment and other maintenance operations was not con-
sidered in detail. The simplifying assumption was made
that the four modules would be replaced every eight
years.

A capital cost associated with replacement of reactor
vessels and cores was obtained by use of a replacement
cost factor. The capital needed at the present time to
amount to $1 eight years hence is $0.63, 16 years hence
is $0.39, and 24 years hence is $0.25 if the interest rate
is 6%. The total replacement cost factor is the sum of
these, or 1.27. The total replacement cost of four
vessels and cores is $11 million, so the capital that must
be set aside at the time of plant construction for future
reactor replacements is $14 million. This capital would
not incur all the fixed charges given in Table A.12. A
rate of 8% was taken as being more appropriate in
arriving at a total replacement cost of about 0.2
mili/kwhr.

The estimated fuel cycle cost for the two-fluid MSBR
is summarized in Table 6.4. Among the major con-
stituents of the cost are items associated with the large
capital investment in inventories of fissile and fertile

materials and carrier salt. The inventories were treated

74

as a nondepreciating investment subject to fixed charges
of 10%. The daily makeup and discard of salt in the
processing plant amount to complete replacement of
the fuel carrier salt every five years.

The cost associated with the investment in processing
equipment is about 0.1 mill/kwhr and is based on the
equipment costs reported in ORNL-3996.! This cost,
escalated to 1968 conditions, as explained in Table 6.4,
is included in the fuel cycle cost. The usual fixed
charges of 13.7% and 80% plant factor were applied.

"Operating costs associated only with the chemical
processing were also included. A product credit of
about 0.1 mill/kwhr was estimated on the basis of a 4%
yield and 233UF, worth of about $14/g. The total fuel
cycle cost is about 0.5 mill/kwhr, or about 0.7
mill/kwhr if the expense of replacing the reactor vessels
and cores is included.

The costs for operating the power station are sum-
marized in Table A.14. The total is about 0.3
mill/kwhr. It includes labor and materials for normal
operation and maintenance, insurance, and miscella-
neous services. Also included is the expense of replacing
coolant salt. This estimate assumes 2% makeup per year
and a cost of about 25¢/Ib for sodium fluoroborate.
Subsequent study and allowances for escalation have
resulted in more recent estimates of 50¢/lb, although
this would possibly be reduced by quantity buying in
an MSBR industry.
