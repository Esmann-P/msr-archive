DECLA3SIFICATION CF MOLTEN GALT REACTOR This is copy.

 

SYMBOL: C:CLM

5. J. Murphy

The subject of your memorandum dated lovember 13, 1957 has been
reviewed.

We have recently been advised that molten salt work has been dis-
continued in the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Program on the grounds
that it is not a suitable approach to the solution of the problem
of the ANP. In view of this, and because such information would
appear to be quite useful to the civilian power application program,
the work which was described in the attachments to your above
referenced memorandum may be carried out as unclassified research
within the terms of Category II of AEC Manual Chapter 3403,

The above authorization does not include, nor would it permit,
declassification of any aspects of reactor design relating
specifically to aircraft application. Great care should be
exercised to prevent the release of the fact that this work was
discarded from the ANP program as being an impractical, or an
unsuccessful approach.

3403-06 Procedures and Authorizations

061 It is expected that off-site research sponsored by the AEC may
vary from the completely unclassified research, through research in fields
which are classified but declassifiable, to fields which are classified and non-
declassifiable, The same range of possible classification will, of course,
exist within AEC -sponsored laboratories,

062 The following categories have been established as guides to proper
classification and security procedures for off-site as well as onsite projects,
In all cases determination of the proper category for, a given project shall be
the responsibility of the cognizant Washington Division Director, Prior to
conducting research considered to be in Categories Il and III, the concurrence
of the Director of Classification shall be obtained through the cognizant Di-
vision Director, i

_a, Category I, --(Normally, no Q-clearances required; no exclusion
areas, all notebooks and reports unclassified, completely {ree

“which, in the opinion of the cognizant Washington Divisi

rector, fall clearly within the area of unclassified research

Fields or topics in this category are set forth in the! "Guide:

Unclassified Fields of Research" attached as Appendix 3402-04;

Where, in the opinion of the cognizant Division Director, a ro

ect is clearly within this category and there is e

‘ which in their early stages will not involve restricted data. but
which as the work progresses may approach restricted data, =
Such research programs can be initiated on an unclassified basis,
However, when itbecomes apparent that restricted data is beingap-
proached, it shall be the responsibility of the Security Monitor: *
or the Senior Investigator to assure that the proper security
- safeguards (including necessary Q-clearances) are applied,

To discharge this responsibility properly, itis essential that the
Security Monitor or Senior Investigator keep himself continuously
informed of the progress of the work so that he can impose the
appropriate security safeguards promptly when it appears that
restricted data may be developed. An example of a project that /
may be carried out under this category is that kind of research /
