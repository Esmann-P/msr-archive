FRACTIONAL CRYSTALLIZATION REACTIONS IN THE SYSTEM LiF-BeF,-ThF,

R. E. Thoma and J. BE. Riceit

ABSTRACT

Equilibrium and non-equilibrium crystallization reactions in the system
LiF-BeF,-ThF, are analyzed in relation to their potential application to

molten salt reactor fuel reprocessing. Heterogeneous equilibria in the

temperature range from the liquidus at 590°C to the solidus at 350°C are

described quantitatively and in detail by means of ten typical isothermal

sections and by three temperature-composition sections. The implications

of metastable fractionation-in this temperature interval are discussed

as a possible feed control step in reductive extraction reprocessing of
molten salt breeder reactor fuels.

INTRODUCTION

The ORNL Molten Salt Reactor Program is devoted to the development
of molten salt breeder reactors which employ mixtures of molten fluorides
as core fluids. Until recently, the most promising approach to the
development of molten salt breeder reactors appeared to be a two-
region reactor with fissile and fertile materials in separate fuel and
blanket streams. Thorium would be carried in the blanket salt, in a
salt stream which would consist of a 7LiF-BeF,-ThF, mixture. Advances
in chemical reprocessing have provided evidence recently that 233pg and
possibly the rare earth fission products can be separated from mixed
thorium-uranium salt by reductive extraction methods employing liquid
bismuth. This development, along with other design developments, makes
possible a single-fluid breeder reactor, one which has greater simplicity
and reliability than the two-fluid reactor. The fuel for the single
fluid reactor would be composed of "LiF, BeF,, ThF,, and 233yr,, and
might be expected to contain ~ 12 mole ¢% ThF,;. Optimization of the "LiF
and BeF, concentrations is not complete, because the trade-off values
of several significant factors have not yet been established. These
include selection limitations imposed by the equilibrium phase behavior
of the LiF-BeF,-ThF, system (?23UF, concentration will be only 0.2 mole
%, and is therefore of little consequence in this connection), physical
properties such as viscosity, vapor pressure, thermal conductivity, and
the relations of LiF-BeF,-ThF, composition to the development of

chemical processes for removal of protactinium and the lanthanides.

Effective separation of the rare earth fission products from
fluoride salt streams which contain thorium fluoride is the keystone to
development of semi-continuous reprocessing in single-fluid molten salt
reactors. Several methods for reprocessing spent LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, fuels
are currently under investigation. The method which is regarded as most
tractable for engineering development involves the selective chemical re-
duction of the various components into liquid bismuth solutions. at about
600°C, utilizing multistage countercurrent extraction operations. The
current status of engineering development of this process has been
described by Whatley et al.’ The initigl steps remove uranium and
protactinium by reductive extraction.” A strong incentive then exists to
remove the rare-earth fission products from the remgining salt. The most

nearly feasible approach to this separation seems to be their extraction
into bismuth alloy,” even though the recycle volumes of extractant are
marginally acceptable. The efficiency of this separation step would
be greatly enhanced if the concentration of the rare earths in the
salt mixture were increased by at least tenfold, and if the residual
salt solutions were of a much lower concentration of thorium fluoride.
That the LiF-BeF,-ThF, phase diagram” shows the occurrence of low
melting mixtures of low thorium fluoride content which are producible
from MSBR single-core fluids by metastable crystallization has suggested
the possibility that non-equilibrium fractionation reactions might be
exploited as a feed control step in the reductive extraction process.
Because of its relative complexity, the unpublished version of the
LiF-BeF,-ThF, phase diagram may experience less frequent or less
effective application in molten salt reactor technology than is
warranted by the developments cited above. We therefore describe in
thig report further detailed aspects of equilibrium and non-equilibrium

behavior in the system.

LIQUID-SOLID PHASE REACTIONS IN THE SYSTEM LiF-BeF,-ThF,

Methods for interpreting polythermsl and isothermal phase diagrams
are described extensively in an earlier report’ where the phase relation-
ships in a number of fluoride systems were analyzed in detail.  Interpre-
tation of the equilibrium behavior in the system LiF-BeF,-ThF,” (Figure 1)
is somewhat more complex than for the systems analyzed because of the
occurrence of an unusual solid solution which is produced as the compound
3LiF.ThF, crystallizes from LiF-BeF,-ThF, melts. The crystal phase of
nominal composition, 3LiF.ThF,, precipitates as a ternary solid solution
which, at its maximum in composition variability (near the solidus),
is described by a composition triangle with apices at LiF-ThF, (75-25
mole %), LiF-BeF,-ThF, (58-16-26 mole %), and LiF-BeF,-ThF, (59-20-21
mole ¢%). Two substitution models may provide an explanation for the
single phase solid solution area: (1) a substitution of one Be*" ion
for a nit ion with the simultaneous formation of a mm vacancy for every
four Be?" ions substituted for tit ions to provide electroneutrality and
(2) substitution of a single Be? ion for a Ti’ ion with the simultaneous

+
formation of a Li vacancy. Model (1) would afford a solid solution

limit in good agreement with the leg of the triangular area with the
lesser ThF, content whereas model (2) would give a line extending from

3LiF.ThF, toward BeF,-ThF, (60-40 mole %). This is a limiting line

which permits considerably higher ThF, content than that found experi-
mentally. Accordingly, it appears that both models are simultaneously
applicable for: the crystallization behavior of 3LiF-ThF, as it crystallizes
from LiF-BeF,-ThF, melts. Once the crystal structure of 3LiF.ThF, has
been established (a study of the structure is currently in progress’)

it will be possible to appraise the validity of these models.

Application of ternary phase diagrams to technology often requires
a knowledge of the identities and compositions of the various phases in
equilibrium at specific temperatures. Such information is represented
by equilibrium phase diagrams. Typically, phase diagrams of ternary
systems are presented as projections of temperature-composition prisms
on their basal planes. When such schematic representation includes
liquidus temperatures, equilibrium crystallization and melting reactions
can be described in a quantitative manner. Here, the use of isothermal
sections is often valuable, particularly if the phase diagram is complex.
The chief feature of the isothermal section is that it provides informa-

tion both about the identity and relative masses of coexisting phases.

The crystallization behavior of the 3LiF.ThF, ternary solid solution
determines the composition sequence as LiF-BeF,-ThF, melts are cooled.
A series of equilibrium isotherms is shown in Figs. 2 to 11, which
describe all the equilibrium reactions in the temperature interval from
590°C to 350°C, i.e., the liquidus-solidus interval of chief relevance
to the compositions which are likely to have application in molten salt
reactor technology, and in which gl1 3LiF.ThF, solid solution melting-
freezing reactions occur. Within this interval all the solid phases
of the system are involved. The equilibrium behavior of chief importance
to us is described further by the temperature-composition sections,
3LiF-Th¥F,-2LiF-BeF,, LiF-ThF,-2LiF-Bel,, and LiF-2ThF,-2LiF-BeF,, shown

in Figs. 12-14 (schematic, not to scale).

The isothermal sections included in Figs. 2 to 11 are drawn to scale
and represent the experimental results which were the basis of the
previously published phase diagram.” Composition-temperature relations
in the LiF-BeF,~ThF, system for LiF concentrations greater than 50 mole

% are shown in detail in Fig. 15.

The straight lines appearing in Figs. 2 to ll are tie-lines (or
"conodes") connecting two phases which are in equilibrium. In Fig. 16,
point P, as a point on such a tie-line joining points b and z, represents
a mixture of the phases (or compositions) b and z with the mole fraction

of b equal to the ratio of line lengths zP/zb.

In the case of a mixture of three phases, such as the points a, b, c
making up the total composition at point P (Fig. 16), the relative
amounts of the phases a, b, c¢ making up P may be determined as follows,
with the three fractions defined as x of a, y of b, 1-x-y of ¢. Then:

(1) Graphically: extend the line bP to fix the point z on the
line ac. Then y = zP/zb, and x = (zc/ac) (1L-y).

(2) Analytically: let the fractions of the components A and B
at each of the four points (a, b, c, P) be

POTENTIAL APPLICATION OF FRACTIONAL CRYSTALLIZATION

IN CHEMICAL REPROCESSING

Under equilibrium conditions, the crystallization end-point in
three component systems such as in the LiF-BeF,-ThF, system, depends
on the "compatibility" or three solid phase triangles of the equilibrium
diagram. As an example, compositions in the triangle LiF - 3LiF-ThF,-
2LiF-BeF, have their crystallization end-point at the 444°C peritectic
reaction point. As noted previously,’ dynamic crystallization of
LiF-BeF,-ThF, mixtures does not follow the equilibrium crystallization
diagram exactly; instead, non-equilibrium crystallization proceeds
characteristically by sub-cooling (i.e., delayed crystallization under
dynamic cooling), and by incomplete recombination of liquid and solid
phases at the peritectic reaction points. Thus, liquids are produced
from mixtures which are of interest to us, primarily those containing
high concentrations of LiF, which are richer in BeF, than their
equilibrium counterparts, and which crystallize as described by the
lower melting areas of the phase diagram. The consequence of non-
equilibrium fractionation is thus to produce liquid residues which are

lower in ThF, content than at equilibrium.

Let us examine the difference between equilibrium and non-equilibrium
crystallization behavior of a liquid composition that would partially
typify the reactions of MSBR salts. Suppose the composition c¢, LiF-
BeF,-ThF, (63-32-5 mole %), undergoes equilibrium crystallization.

On complete solidification, the frozen salt will consist of the three
crystalline phases, 3LiF:ThF, ss, 2LiF.BeF,; and Li¥F-2ThF, in proportions
given by the position of point ¢ in the corresponding triangle of Figs.

9, 10, and 11.

For non-equilibrium crystallization this triangle has no signifi-
cance. The non-equilibrium process consists of four consecutive steps,

seen on the basis of the following diggram:
25

2LiF.BeF, (= H)

Step (1): freezing starts at ~ 446°C for composition c, and the
liquid travels on the solid solution liquidus surface to reach curve
Py, - P3 at some point g (at ~ 440°C), while precipitating some solid
solution of composition between a and b, say a' as average.

Step (2): liquid travels on curve P;-P3, to reach P3 (433°C),
vhile precipitating a mixture of solid solution (of composition between
b and s, say b' as average) and 2LiF.BeF,.

Step (3): liquid travels on curve P;-E, to reach E(356°) while
precipitating mixture of LiF-2ThF, + 2LiF-.BeF,.

Step (4): liquid at E(356°) freezes to mixture of LiF-:2ThF, +
2LiF.BeF, + BeF,.

Step (3): draw straight line DH and extend straight line P3E
back to fix point z on the line DH:

 

LiF o
2LiF-BeF, (=H)

Moles of liquid reaching E = a (mz) = ms;

Moles ThF, precipitated (in step 3, or between 433° and 356°)
=2 (zi) ( ) =
3 \DH Mo-m3) = P3,
since x = 2/3.
Step (4): moles ThF, precipitated in this step (at 356°)
=x, - (p1 + p2 + p3).
Thus, given the original composition ¢ on the phase diagram as we
have it, one can make estimates regarding what happens in steps (1) and

(2), and these estimates fix what happens in steps (3) and (4), for the
28

limit of non-equilibrium behavior. This means a process in which there
is never any interaction between precipitated solid and solution. Actual
behavior will of course be somewhere between this and the equilibrium

process.

Since non-equilibrium fractionation of LiF-BeF,-ThF, melts
produces final liquids which are low in thorium, and since the
concentrations of rare earths in the solutions are expected to be about
20 ppm at the time when fuel processing is economically mandatory, one
might anticipate that a semi-zone refining step might well produce
and transport liquids of low thorium concentration and containing a
relatively high concentration of rare earths (the solubility of the
lanthanide trifluorides in any of the melts one might encounter is
almost certainly to be at least 200 ppm at the low temperatures which
would be present in this part of the feeder apparatus), The efficiency
of this concentration step could possibly be impaired seriously if the
rare earth trifluorides either formed intermediate compounds (such
compounds are formed only for the lanthanides of 2 63) which interacted
with the crystallizing phases or otherwise formed solid solutions with
any ‘of the crystallizing phases. The structure of OLiF-BeF,0 and
LiF.ThF,’ are known and believed to be incapable of serving as solid
state hosts for the rare earth fluorides. The 3LiF-ThF, solid solution
is an unknown factor in this consideration and could conceivably act as
a solvent for lanthanide ions. This possibility as well as the
possibility that LiF-.2ThF, might also serve as a solid state solvent
for lanthanide ions could be examined easily through a small scale

laboratory program.
