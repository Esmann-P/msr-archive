Abstract

A consideration of the characteristics of fused salt-ThF} solutions
suitable for use in homogeneous reactors is presented, together with a

brief survey of the literature pertaining to such solutions and a summary

of the experimental work accomplished.

 

 
oll he ORNL-1030

Sumery

Fused salt solutions containing thorium, primarily by virtue of their
generally low vepor pressures, will probably assume a role of increasing im-
portance as blanket and fuel solutions of high temperature power and breeder
reactors. The literature offers little information on Th), solutions with
other salts and contains no reference to a specific solution which would be
satisfactory for homogensous reactor use. Experimental work has been initi-
ated with a view to finding an acceptable ThF) solution. Binary systems of
ThF), with LiF, MgFp, PbFo, AlF3 and UF), have been investigated and some pre-
liminary measurements have been made on the ternary, ThF)-LiF-MgF,, and the
quaternary, ThFy-LiF-MgF,-NaF. To date, the mixtures found which are of most
interest are a ThF),-LiF binary eutectic containing 26 mole % Th¥), and melting
at 550°C, and a quaternary eutectic containing 20 mole % ThF), 62.3 mole %
LiF, 12.7% NaF and 5% MgFo, melting at 530°C. The concentration of Th in both
of these mixtures is greater than 1000 g/liter and the ratios of the neutron
capture cross section of Th-232 to the sum of the cross sections of the other
constituents of the mixture are 73 in the case of the binary and 16 for the
quaternary.

It is believed that a further reduction of the melting point of ThF), can
be obtained in fluoride solutions meeting other requirements for reactor use

and that the search for such solutions should be continued when the design and

construction of homogeneous U-233 power-breeders comes nearer to actuality.

Introduction

Fused salt solutions for service as either reactor fuels or breeding
blankets in high-temperature power or breeder reactors appear to combine many
of the more desirable features of both aqueous media and liquid metal and
alloy systems. They might be expected to possess the low vapor pressures
characteristic of liquid metals and alloys while, at the same time, they might
contain the high concentrations of fuel or breeding material expected of aque-
ous systems. Since the Chemical Technology Division is a group concerned pri-
marily with the chemical processing of reactor product solutions, it was felt
that some familiarity with fused salts and especially with problems likely to
arise in their processing should be acquired.

A considerable effort has been underway for some time in the Materials
Chemistry Division to find a UF), -fused fluoride solution suitable for use as
a fuel for the aircraft reactor of the ANP Project and a survey of the liter-

(1)

ature relative to this problem has been made. Other work of this nature
has been carried out at Battelle. (2) Relatively little experimental work has
been done with ThF) in such solutions and so far as is known, no organized
program of research om this subject 1s at present underway. Consequently, it
was believed that a search for a fused fluoride solution containing Th which
would be suitable for use in a U-233 breeder reactor would serve the double
purpose of initiating studies along a line of great potential interest to the
. planning and design of future reactors and, at the same time, would serve as

a starting point in the study of the chemical processing of fused salt systems

in general. -—

Introduction (continued)

The experimental work covered by this report represents only the first
step of & search for a thorium solution satisfactory for use in some future
homogeneous reactor. Considerably more effort will probably be necessary
before such a solution is found.

The remeinder of this report is divided into three parts. The first part
deals with the specifications for an accepteble thorium reactor solution; the
second deals with the results of a literature survey made at one stage of the
problem; and the last part is devoted to a description and discussion of the

experimental work accomplished.

Thorium Reactor Solutions

Thorium-fused salt solutions could find use in either of two general
applications in breeder reactors. One application is that in which the solution
would be situated around and on the outside of the reactor core in the form of
a so-called blanket; the second application might be in a self-moderated type
of breeder in which the thorium would be present in the fuel solution together
with U-233 and a moderator, e.g. beryllium.

With the assistance of R. B. Briggs of the Long Renge Planning Group,
several preliminary specifications, summarized in Table I, were proposed which
could serve as a gulde in the search for these thorium solutions. The four

properties considered (cross section, Th composition, vapor pressure and melt-

ing point) do not represent either a complete or an inviolate list of the

specifications required; they are intended to give merely a rough picture of
vhat, in the light of current thinking, would be desirable characteristics for
an eventual thorium reactor solution to possess.

In both applications, the nuclear considerations are of paramount im-
portance. If the specifications of Table I are accepted, it becomes apparent
that one is limited to only a small number of fluorides having sufficiently
low capture cross sections and favorable vapor pressures to enable them to be
used in a reactor solution with thorium. These salts are listed with their
neutron capture cross sections and melting points in Table II.

It is realized that of the compounds listed in Table II, ZrFj might prove
unusable because of its tendency to sublime at temperatures of the order of
several hundred degrees and BiFg might eventually prove troublesome because of
difficulty in preventing the displacement of Bi*' from the melt by meny of the
structural metals of which the container walls would normally be made. Other
fluorides of slightly higher cross section than those listed in Table II might
be considered for use but could, of course, be present only in relatively

smaller concentrations.

A Literature Survey

A survey of the project and open literature was made to supplement the
1)
search made by Grimes and a1.’ Special emphasis was placed on phase studies

* of the particular salts listed in Table II. The results of this survey which

The ThFy-KF and ThF,-RbF reference was included in Table III despite the
unfavorable nuclear characteristics of K and Rb because it represented the only
specific reference to ThF) eutectic mixtures found in the literature.
Zachariagen(1l) has studied double salt formation in the systems NaF-ThF) and
KF -Th¥y, by the X-ray diffraction method but he apparently did not investigate
the complete phase diagrams of thege systems. ThF) has also been found to form

a very stable complex with Rb, having the formula, Rb3ThF7. (3)

Experimental

Apparatus
The equipment used for this work was the same as that used by other work-

ers for thermal analysis studies of UF), salt mixtures. (12) In essence, it con-
sisted of a 5-inch chromel-wound pot furnace capable of operation at tempera-
tures up to 1100°C. The temperature of the furnace was controlled by means of
a variable transformer connected in series with the A. C. supply. The salt
mixtures were heated in graphite crucibles which fit into the furnace in such
a manner that an atmosphere of N, could be maintained over the melt during
heating and cooling periods. Temperatures were measured by means of a chromel-
alumel thermocouple situated on the inside of a graphite stirrer which extended
to the bottom of the crucible. The temperatures were measured and recorded by

"a Brown "Electronik" potentiometer and tests indicated that the temperatures

Materials
ThE),

The thorium fluoride used was obtained from the Iowa State College. The
thorium analyzed, gravimetrically, 75.1% and the fluoride, 25.5%. The the-
oretical Th content is 75.3%. A spsctrographic analysis indicated the sample
was essentially free of rare earths. The melting point of this ThF) was found
by experiment to be 1080 + 5°¢. No reference could be found to a previous melt-
ing point determination for this compound.

ALF3

The AlFs wag prepared from a stock of Baker and Adamson AlF3-xH,0 by heat-
ing the hydrated material in an atmosphere of HF to about 600°C over a period
of 3 to 5 hours. The vendor reported impurities in the ALF. xHA0 amounting to
less than 0.014%. The dehyrated product amalyzed 32.5% Al and 67.9% F.(the-
oretical Al = 32.1%). The high volatility of AlFq in the neighborhood of
1000°¢C prevented an experimental determination of its melting point with the

equipment on hand.
MgFo

The MgF, used in this work was purchased from Eimer and Amend and was re-
ported by them to be 99% pure. A spectrographic analysis indicated the major
impurities to be Ca, Na, Cr, Fe and Ta.

FbFo
The PbF, used was Baker and Adamson "Purified" material and was not

3) on (13)
5°C, which may be compared with a literature value of 822°C.

LiF

The LiF was material purchased from the Maywcod Chemical Works. No
analysis of the LiF was carried out but an experimental determination of 1ts
melting point (845°C) agreed exactly with the most relisble value obtained
from the Literature. ‘2¥) On the bagis of this agreement and its clean appear-

ance, 1t is believed that this was material of high purity.
TF}

The UF} used was obtained from K-25 through the ORNL SF Accountability
Office.

Prior to their use in this work, all of the chemicals were dried by heat-
ing in an oven at 110-115°C for 24 hours and were stored in dessicators upon
removal from the oven.

Results
oF), LiF

The phase diagram for this system 1s given in Figure 1. A eutectic con-~
taining about 26 mole % ThF) is formed which melte at 550°C. Some difficulty
wag experienced in obtaining liquidus points from cooling curves of mixtures
in the vicinity of the eutectic because of very pronounced super cooling. A
compound with en incongruent melting point at about 925°C 1g formed at 75 mole
% ThFY.

 

 
 

- 1h OBNL-1030
ThE), -MgFp

The ThF), -rich side of this system up to 60 mole $ MgF, was investigated
and the results are shown in Figure 2. Two eutectics were found which melted
at 915° and 925°C corresponding to compositions of 25 mole % and 40 mole %
ThF),; respectively. A compound with a congruent melting point of 937° was
indicated at 33 mole % MgF, and can be represented by the formula, MgThoFqq.
The investigation of this binary system was not carried further than 60% MgFo
because of the temperature limitations cf the equipment but it seems probable
that no further eutectics of immediate interest to this problem would be found
at higher MgF, concentrations.
ThF), -FbFo

The proposed phase diagram for this system is given in Figure 3. Two
eutectics were obtained, ome at 35 mole % ThFy, melting at 925° and a second
at 62 mole % ThF) which melted at 880°C. Some indications of a third eutectic
melting at about 760° and containing less than 2 mole % ThF) were obtained but
its presence wes not definitely established. Two compounds with congruent
melting points at about 950° and 942°C were indicated, corresponding to the
formulas Pby7Th3Fl¢ and PbThFg, respectively. A third compound having an
incongruent melting point of about 1045°C was indicated with a formuls, PbThgF3g.

Measurements of this binary proved unsatisfactory in a sense because of
a reduction of the Pb't to elemental Pb by the graphite crucible and stirrer.
This reduction was not observed to occur appreciably at temperatures less than

800° but became a greater problem with increasing temperature.

ThE), ~AlF3
Considerable effort was expended on this system with only moderate suc-

cess. The AlFq sublimed at temperatures from 900 to 1100°C to such an extent
that reliable results could not be obtained with mixtures containing more than
20 mole % AIF3. A reproducible eutectic halt was obtained at about 950°C in
the cooling curves of this binsry system but the composition of the eutectic
mixture could not be determined. It is estimated that it lay somewhere in the
vicinity of 25 mole % AlFs.

ThE), UR),

The isomorphism of ThF) and up, 7) would lead one to expect them to be
miscible in both the solid and liquid states. Although supercooling prevented
the accurate determination by thermal analysis of a phase diagram for this
system, indications were that liquidus and solidus curves existed which ex-
hibited neither a maximum nor minimum point. X-ray analyses of several of the
solidified melts showed that solid. solutions were formed.

ThE}, -LiF-MgF,

This was the only ternary system investigated to any appreciable extent
and it was studied in only an exploratory manner. An indication of a ternary
eutectic of high ThFj content melting at 690° was obtained but since this tem-
perature was greatly in excess of the desired melting point, no formel attempt
was made to establish the composition.

A reference found in the literaature to the NaF-LiF-MgF, eutectica(3)

 

 
ol ~19- ORNL~-1030
ThF} -LiF-NaF-MgFo (continued)

seemed worthy of further investigation, especially the secondary eutectic con-
taining only 12% NaF. Experiments were carried out which coasisted, at first,
of adding TF), to the 29% MgFo, 12% NaF, 59% LiF eutectic mixture and finally,
of changing the concentrations of the other components empirically. In this
way, a quaternary eutectic was obtained which melted at 530°C. The approximate

composition of this eutectic, expressed in mole percentages was:

20.06 TF

62.3 LiF

12.7 NaF
5.0 MgFo

UF), -LiF-NaF-MgF,

Proceeding along the same lines as described above for the case of the
ThF), quaternary mixture, & eutectic was found in this system which melted at

about 460°C. Tts approximate composition was:

25.00 UF,
58.2 LiF
11.8 NaF
5.0 MgF,
Discussion

Of the systems studied, two eutectic mixtures stand out in the respect
that their melting points are both more than 100° under the next lowest melt-
ing mixture found. The eutectics referred to are the TkF)-LiF binary eutectic,
- containing 26 mole % ThF) and melting at 550° and the ThF)-LiF-NeF-MgF, quater-

nary, containing 20 mole % ThF) and melting at 530°¢. The concentration of Th

a

 

 
 

Ld -20- ORNL-1030

Discussion (continued)

in these eutectics corresponds to about 2000 g/L in the binary and 1500 g/L in
the quaternary. The neutron capture cross section ratios (Table I) are 73 and
16, respectively and the vapor pressures at 800°C were sby observation, much
less than 760 mm. On the other hand, the melting points are still considerably
higher than the 300°C taken as the maximum desirable melting point.

The ThF)-FbF,, ThF)-MgF, and ThE), -AlF3 binary systems show no eutectic of
sufficiently low melting point to be of immediate interest to this prcblem.
Their principle value lies in the contribution they would meke to a study of
ternary systems containing these components. From the same viewpoint, binary
systems of ThF) with BeFj, Bir, and ZrF should be investigated.

The UF) -LiF-NaF-MgF, quaternary eutectic is similar im both melting point
and uranium concentration to a UF} -LiF-NaF ternary eutectic reported previously
as being under consideration as a fuel for the ANP reactor. (15) Although indi-
cations are that the unavailsbility of 11? isotope will preclude, for the time
being, the use of a LiF constituted fuel in this reactor, it should be pointed
out that, other factors being equal, the better neutron economy of this quater-
nary would likely make it more acceptable than the ternary eutectic.

The similarity between the diagram found for the ThF), -LiF system and that
obtained by Grimes, et. a1. (12) for UF), -LiF is rather remarkable. A UF), -LiF
eutectic melting at 480°C was found at about 26 mole % UF) and likewise a com-
pound, Li03F, 4 » With an incongruent melting point was obtained. The same in-

vestigators(16) have found a eutectic in the UF) -FbF, system at 62 mole % UF),

a_—

 
tg 2] ORNL- 1030

Discussion (continued)

vhich melts at about 730° and have obtained a diagram for the UF), -FbF, system
vhich conforms in most principle respects to the character of the diagram pre-
sented in Figure 3. No attempt was made to rigorously define the extent of
the similarity between ThF), and UF) systems but from indications obtained in
this investigation, a close coordination between the work done on these two
general systems should be maintained.

From the results obtained thus far in this work, the possibility seems
rather remote that a mixture meeting all the specifications set for this prob-
lem will be found. On the other hand, there appears to be a very real 1likli-
hood that mixtures which come nearer meeting them than anything so far found
can be obtained and such mixtures might eventually prove as satisfactory for
reactor use as the "ideal" one considered here. The work done to date can be
considered as no more than a start on such a search and whenever the importance
of this problem is adjudged more immediate, a thorough and more nearly complete

solution to the problem should be allowed.
