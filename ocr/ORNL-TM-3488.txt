MASS TRANSFER BETWEEN HASTELIOY N AND HAYNES ALIOY No. 25
IN A MOLTEN SODIUM FLUOROBORATE MIXTURE

 

J. W. Koger and A, P. Litman
ABSTRACT

The compatibility of Haynes alloy No. 25 and Hastelloy N
with fused NaBF,~8 mole % NaF was determined in the range
605 to 460°C, The cobalt-base alloy was inadvertently
incorporated in the Hastelloy N thermal convection loop and
was exposed to the fluoroborate salt mixture for 3660 hr.

The Haynes alloy No. 25 suffered damage by selective
leaching of cobalt and chromium, which migrated to the
Hastelloy N, The mechanism of corrosive attack was activity-
gradient and temperature-gradient mass transfer. Haynes
alloy No. 25 is more susceptible to attack by the fluoroborate
‘mixture than Hastelloy N. - The presence of the small amount
of Haynes alloy No. 25 in the system did not compromise later
experiments on the monometallic Hastelloy N system. Penetra-.
tion of dgposited cobalt corresponded to a diffusivity of

5.6 x 107T u’ [sec in, : Hastelloy N at 465°C.

 

i INTRODUCTION

Two thermal convection loops, NCL-13 and -14, began operation in
October 1967 to determine the compatibility of standard and titanium-

modified Hastelloy N alloys? with NaBF, —8 mole % NaF salt, a candidate

secondary coolant for molten-salt reactors. The loops, which are
pictured in Fig. 1, operated with maximum temperatures of 605°C and
induced temperature differences of 145°C.

Both the heated ‘and cooled sections of the loops contained removable

| Hastelloy N specimens. These specimens were withdrawn periodically

along with salt samples to follow. corrosion processes as a function of

time, After some 4000 hr of operation, the Hastelloy N specimens in

the hottest and coldest regions of the loops were removed and subjected

“to detailed metallurgical: analysis. Portions of the specimens were

sent - for microprobe analysis to determine possible composition gradients

.due to mass transfer. Initial results showed ‘that a large amount of

cobalt had deposited on ‘both the hot and cold leg specimens, The source
of the cobalt was traced to “the 1/8-in.=-diam rods that held the removable
specimens. These rods were determined to be Haynes alloy No. 25 rather
than the specified Hastelloy N, Further investigation revealed that

the source of the Haynes alloy No, 25 was a misidentified storage carton.
The specimen hanger rods were replaced with Hastelloy N and the experi-
ments were continued.

We have taken advantage of the situation to obtain information on
the corrosion of cobalt- and nickel-base alloys simultaneously exposed
to a molten fluoroborate salt, Further details on the compatibility of
Hastelloy and other alloys with fluroborate salts have been reported,’ +!

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

The test devices used in the experiments were thermal convection
loops in a harp configuration, with surge tanks atop each leg for sample
and specimen access. The flow was generated by the difference in
density of the salt in the hot and cold legs of the loop, and the salt

flow velocity was approximately 7 ft/min.

Loop Fabrication

The loops were fabricated from 0.606-in.-ID Hastelloy N tubing with
a 0.072-in. wall thickness. The annealed material, heat 5097, was
TIG welded to Specifications PS-23 and PS-25 and inspected to MET-WR-200
‘specification. The finished loop was stress relieved at 880°C for 8 hr

in hydrogen.
Salt Preparation

The fluoroborate salt mixture used in the test program was furnished
by the Fluoride Processing Group of the Reactor Chemistry Division, and
its composition before test is given in Table 1. To mix and purify
the salt, the raw materials were first heated in a nickel-lined vessel
to 150°C under vacuum and held for 15 hr. Then the salt was heated to
500°C, agitated with helium for a few hours, and transferred to the fill
vessel. At 600°C, the BF3 pressure is approximately 200 torr.

Loop Operations

The loops were heated by pairs of clamshell heaters placed end to

end, with the input power controlled by silicon controlled rectifier

units and the temperature controlled by a current proportioning controller.

The loop temperatures were measured by Chromel vs Alumel thermocouples

that had been spot welded to the outside of the tubing, covered by a

layer of quartz tape, and then covered with stainless steel shim stock.

Tubular electric heaters controlled by variable autotransformers

furnished the heat to the cold leg portions of the loops.
Before filling with salt, the loops were degreased with ethyl
alcohol, dried, and then heated to 150°C under vacuum to remove any traces

- of moisture. A helium mass “spectrometer leak detector was used to check

for leaks in the system. -

The procedure for filling the loops consisted of heating the loop,
the salt pot, and all connecting lines to approximately 550°C and
applying helium pressure to the salt supply vessel to force the salt into
the loop. Air was continuously blown on freeze valves leading to the dump
and flush tanks to provide a positive salt seal,

All fill lines exposed to the fluoroborate salt were Hastelloy N.
All temporary connections from £111 line to loop were made with stainless
steel compression fittings. = i

‘The first charge of salt was held for 24 hr in the loops at the
maximum operation temperature and then dumped. This flush salt charge
was intended to remove surface. oxides or other impurities left in the
loops. The loops were then refilled with fresh salt, and operation began.
Once the loop was filled, the heaters on the cold legs of the. loops

were turned off. As much insulation was removed as necessary to obtain

the proper temperature difference by exposing the cold leg to ambient
air. Helium cover gas of 99. 998%. purity and under slight pressure

(approx 5 psig) was maintained over the salt in the loops during operation,

Each loop contained Ue ‘Hastelloy N specimens 0.75 x O. 38 X 0.030 in.,
each with a surface area of 0.55 in.? (3.5 cm?). Seven specimens were
attached at different vertical positions on 1/8-in. rods (later found
to be Haynes alloy No. 25). This array could be placed into or removed
 

 

 

 

from the loops during operation by means of a double ball valve
arrangement, One rod was inserted in the hot leg and another in the
cold leg of each loop. The surface area of the rod exposed to the salt
was one-ninth that of the loop. The composition of the Hastelloy N

loop tubing is compared with the nominal composition of Haynes alloy No. 25

in Table 2.

The loops were operated at a maximum temperature of 605°C and a
temperature difference of 145°C, with the Hastelloy N specimens and
Haynes alloy No. 25 rod exposed to the salt for 3660 hr.

TEST RESULTS

Preliminary results of analyses from rods and specimens of both
loops (NCL-13 and -14) were identical. Thus, we completed detailed
analyses only on the materials from NCL-13, |

Haynes Alloy No. 25 Samples

After 3660 hr of salt exposure and discovery of the material mixup,
samples of the 1/8-in. Haynes alloy No. 25 specimen holder rods were
taken from various positions and analyzed in detail, Figure 2 shows
the locations of the Hastelloy N specimens, the Haynes alloy No. 25
rod, and the portions removed for analysis.

~The largest pit (not shown) was about 2 mils deep.

Figure 4 shows the metallographic appearance of Sample 1, which

was exposed to BF3 gas at 604°C in the hot leg ‘surge tank, The upper

portion of the figure shows the ares of maxi mum attack, where about 8 mils
of metal was removed and other material was deposited. The lower portion
of the figure is indicative ‘of most of the sample, with about 1 mil of
attack and some deposited meterial,

Samples 1 and 8 (see Fig. 2), exposed only to BF3 gas in the upper
portions of the surge tanks, were noticeably darker than the other
samples, The difference in surface character of the materials exposed
to the gas and the liquid salt is seen in Fig. 5. The Haynes alloy No. 25
rod was analyzed by x-ray fluorescence to determine relative concentra-
tions of Co, Cr, W, Ni, and Fe. The fluorescence results were compared
against as-received Haynes alloy No. 25 which was assigned the composi-
tion given in Table 2. The results, which represent a surface zone
3 to 5 mils deep, are given in Table 3 along with the temperature of
the salt at each position of ‘the rod, Note that the concentration of
tungsten in all samples is “unchanged from the before-test level of 14%.
Thus, the tungsten concentration was used as a standard in the analysis.!?
Samples 1 and 8 showed a significant loss of chromium, from about 19 to
about 4 weight units, and cobalt, from 53 to 20 and 45 weight units,
respectively. Sample 1, at the highest temperature, 604°C, experienced
the greatest loss of material. Samples 2, 9, and 10, which were

- exposed to relatively stagnant salt in the surge tanks above the loop,
all lost chromium and cobalt,

Samples 3 through 7 and 11 through 14 were exposed to ‘circulating
salt at various temperatures. Sample 3, at the hottest position, 598°C,
lost nickel, cobalt, and chromium. Samples, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the hot

 

124 standard weight unit of 100 was used for the unexposed sample.

The exposed and unexposed samples all contained 14 units of tungsten,

so this allowed calculation of the amounts of the other elements. We
were then able to determine if a sample showed a net gain or loss of a
certain element.

leg is much like Sample 7 from the hot leg; both were exposed at about
the same temperature. However, Sample 12 was exposed to a slightly

lower temperature, 487°C, and the analyzed area was almost all nickel

and tungsten. Samples 13 and 14, which were exposed at nearly identical
temperatures, showed an increase in iron and nickel and decrease in cobalt

and chromium concentrations compared to before test.

Hastelloy N Specimens

Figure 6 shows etched and as-polished microstructures of the

Hastelloy N specimen from the hottest position (604°C). The edge exposed
during test was more heavily attacked by the metallographic etchant than
was the underlying base metal. This faster etching response is apparently
due to chromium depletion of the alloy. Figure 7 is the as-polished
microstructure of the Hastelloy N specimen in the coldest position
(465°C). A uniform deposit of approximately 0.25 mil is apparent on

the surface of the specimen,

Electron microprobe studies revealed thet the thin layers on the

edge of the hottest and coldest Hastelloy N specimens contained:

6 um thick on the hot leg specimen and 7.3 wt % Co in a band of the
same thickness on the cold leg specimen. These results were substantia-
ted by qualitative x-ray fluorescence measurements, which showed more
cobalt than iron (approx 5%) in a band near the surface. laser spectro-
graphic analysis showed substantial cobalt at depths less than 20 um
into the material. The amount of cobalt in the Hastelloy N specimen
located at the bottom of the cold leg (approx 465°C) was determined as
a function of position by microprobe and is given in Fig. 8. A cobalt
composition gradient in hot leg specimens, obtained by the microprobe,
was not well defined and will be discussed later,

Using the penetration curve of Fig. 8, we determined the diffusion
coefficient of cobalt in Hastelloy N. A constant surface concentration

of cobalt was assumed to integrate Fick's second law,

Salt Analysis

After test, less than 50 ppm Co was found in the salt. The
significance of this is discussed in the next section. Table 4 shows
the composition of the salt after circulation for 4200 hr. Comparison
with the salt analysis before test (Table 1) shows increases in the

SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS

The chemical and metallurgical analyses show that chromium and
cobalt were leached from the Haynes alloy No. 25 at all test temperatures.
Although the percentage of chromium lost was greater than that of cobalt,

the total mass of chromium lost was less. The cobalt and chromium

“migrated to the Hastelloy N specimens and loop piping. There was also

some ‘evidence of highly localized nickel transfer from the hot section
to the cold section of the Haynes alloy No. 25 rod. Iron deposited on
the Haynes alloy No. 25 in the cold section and was probably supplied
by the leaching of iron from the Hastelloy N loop piping by the salt.
Attack of Haynes alloy No. 25 by BF3 in the vapor phase as evidenced
by loss of alloy constituents was less severe than the salt corrosion.
However, more discoloration and surface roughening were noted on the
samples exposed to the gas. The Haynes alloy No. 25 suffered much more
damage than the Hastelloy N in the vapor phase, Haynes alloy No. 25
appears to be more susceptible to attack by the fluoroborate mixture
than Hastelloy N. |

DISCUSSION

Prior Studies

Past work!’ at ORNL measured the chemical corrosion of various
materials under the conditions experienced during the fluorination of

. molten-salt fuels in the Fluoride Volatility Process. The salt used

was equimolar NaF-ZrF, containing 0 to 5 mole % UF,. Several cobalt-

containing alloys were tested at 600 + 100°C, and the behavior of those

with less than 20 wt % Co was similar to that of Hastelloy N. However,
as the cobalt content exceeded 20 wt %, the alloys showed a much greater

degree of attack than Hastelloy N.

Fluorinaetion in the Oak Ridge National laboratory Fluoride Volatility
Process, ORNL-2832 (June 5, 1961).

In a recent test!“ at ORNL, samples of various materials including
Hastelloy N, Haynes alloy No. 25, and graphite were placed in the vapor
and lizuid zones of a vacuum distillation experiment that used a
LiF-BeF,-ZrF, salt. The temperature ranged from 500 to 1000°C over a
period of 4300 hr in the molten salt and 900 to 1025°C for more than 300 hr
in the vapor. The Haynes alloy No. 25 was the most heavily corroded of
the metals tested and was also brittle at the end of the test. Fracture
of one’ Haynes alloy No. 25 specimen caused a loss of some of the other
specimens during the experiment. Figure 9 shows the Haynes alloy No. 25

specimens before and after test.

Thus, in other studies where both Hastelloy N and high cobalt
alloys were exposed to molten fluorides under highly oxidizing conditions,

Hastelloy N was much more corrosion resistant.

Corrosion Mechanisms.

In polythermal flowing salt systems, corrosion commonly involves
temperature-gradient mass transfer, Figure 10 shows a schematic of
this process. For monometallic systems, the constituents of the salt
or impurities may react with one or more constituents of the loop
material to form salt-soluble compounds. For example, the following
reactions may occur in a salt containing UF; and FeF, exposed to
Hastelloy N: oo

UF, + Cr =» CrF, + UF3 , (1)

FeFp, + Cr » CrFy + Fe . (2)

The equilibrium constant of corrosion reaction (1) is temperature
dependent. Thus, when the salt is forced to circulate through a tempera-
ture gradient, products from the reverse reaction may deposit in the
cooler regions of the system. Since the equilibrium constant for the

chemical reaction increases with increasing temperature, the chemical

activity or concentration of the attacked element in the container mate-
rial will decrease at high temperatures and increase at low temperatures;
that is, in the hotter regions the alloy surface becomes depleted and
metal from the interior of the wall diffuses toward the surface, and in
the colder regions the alloy surface becomes enriched with the diffusing

‘metal. There is, of course, an intermediate temperature at which the’

initial surface composition of the structural metal and the attacked ele-
ment is in equilibrium with the salt. If the temperature dependence of the

mass transfer reaction is small, the rate of metal removal from the salt

of temperature-gradient mass transfer by fluoroborate salt systems
contained in Hastelloy N were cited in the introduction.

In the system under study — Haynes alloy No, 25-Hastelloy N-
fluoroborate salt — an additional mass«transfer mechanism is present
which is termed dissimilar-alloy or activity gradient mass transfer. While

this has been studied in detail for several alkali metal systems, little

work has been done in molten salts. Mass transfer of this type requires
the presence of different alloys in the same fluid and is not contingent
on the presence of a temperature gradient. Figure 11 shows a schematic
of this process. The sequence of events in dissimilar-alloy mass
transfer involves removal of an element from one material and deposition
on a second material; that is, movement from a region of high activity
to one of low activity. Examples of dissimilar metal interactions are
common in niobium and type 316 stainless steel systems exposed
simultaneously to sodium-potassium alloy'® and in the other alkali
metal systems. 16 As might be suspected when the opportunity for both
forms of mass transfer arises, as in the case at hand, corrosion inter-
actions become very complicated. |

In the present studies, chromium and cobalt were removed from the

‘Haynes alloy No. 25 by reaction with salt and were deposited on the

Hastelloy N. This occurred because of the smaller concentration of those
elements (lower activity) in the Hastelloy N. This activity gradient
mechanism would have occurred without a temperature gradient. However,
the effect of the temperature gradient was also evidenced by heavier
deposition of chromium and cobalt on the colder Hastelloy N surfaces.

As mentioned earlier, no large cobalt concentration gradient could
be obtained from the Hastelloy N hot leg specimens, and more cobalt was
found on the cold leg specimens than in the hot leg. Thus, it appears

‘that the net result of the cobalt depositing on the Hastelloy N due to

the activity gradient mechanism and the cobalt mass transfer due to the
temperature gradient mechanism was a continued depletion of cobalt from

the Hastelloy N in the hot section and a deposition in the cold section.

- This depletion could occur if most of the cobalt that transferred from
the Haynes alloy No. 25 did so initially. Chromium behaved in the
same manner in the hot leg. In an all Hastelloy N system, a chromium
-gradient is usually expected “in the ‘hot leg because of the chromium

removal. However, this gradient may not be as large as expected and may
disappear if the chromium diffuses to the surface as fast as it is removed

and possible even at a slightly higher rate.”

However, the chromium
gradient was almost completely masked in this system for the above reasons
and by the chromium deposition from the Haynes alloy No. 25 back to the
hot leg. As mentioned earlier, the microstructure (Fig. 8) does show
evidence of some depletion at the edge of the specimen, but the overall
chromium composition of the specimen showed little change. Nickel and
iron, if removed from the Hastelloy N, would be predicted to deposit on
the Haynes alloy No. 25 by virtue of the activity gradient mechanism.

- This was not observed experimentally, although the effects may have been

swamped by the greater rate of ‘chromium and cobalt transfer.

Significance of Haynes Alloy No. 25 in the
Hastelloy N Test System \

The solid line at Fig. 12 shows the time dependence of experimental
weight changes of Hastelloy N specimens exposed to salt in loop NCL-13,
Note that all specimens showed a net weight gain during the first 200 hr,
As mentioned earlier, in temperature-gradient mass-transfer systems
specimens in hot portions of the loop are expected to lose weight while
those in the cold section should gain weight. However, after this
initial period of weight gain the samples in the hot leg started losing
weight, while the cold leg specimens continued to gain weight. This
initial weight gain lends credence to the idea that most of the cobalt
that transferred from the Haynes alloy No. 25 did so initially. It is
noted that our experimental weight changes reflected this deposition
from the Haynes alloy No. 25. The actual weight loss in an all
Hastelloy N system would be larger and the actual weight gain would be
smaller, Thus, a constant factor was calculated and subtracted from
all our weight changes, resulting in the dotted line, This constant
factor was calculated using an iterative trial-and-error method to obtain

a mass balance on the system fitting the following equation:

MW systen loss AW stem gain © AC ait,
where
AW vsten loss = weight loss for specimens and loop components,
MWsysten gain - weight gain for specimens and components,
AC

salt © content change in salt,

This exercise also allowed us to conclude that our mass-transfer rate

~ would not have been excessive if the cobalt alloy had not been in the

system, The reason that the weight changes due to Haymes alloy No. 25
were so small was that its surface area exposed to the sale is one-ninth

that of the Hastelloy N. Recent work has shown that these weight

CONCLUSIONS

1. Haynes alloy No. 25 in the fluoroborate salt-Hastelloy N alloy
test system suffered damage by loss of significant amounts of cobalt
and chromium, which migrated to the Hastelloy N by virtue of activity-
gradient and temperature-gradient mass transfer.

2. Haynes alloy No. 25 is more susceptible than Hastelloy N to
attack by the fluoroborate mixture.

3. Because of the relatively small amount of Haynes alloy No, 25
in the system (one-ninth the surface area of Hastelloy N), the early
presence of this material did not compromise, beyond the normal 10%
variation in quantitative data, experiments on the present monometallic

Hastelloy N system.
