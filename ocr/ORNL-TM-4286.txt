ALLOY COMPATIBILITY WITH LiF-BeF, SALTS CONTAINING ThF, AND UF,

J. W. Koger
ABSTRACT

Various compatibility tests between LiF-BeF,-based salts and Hastelloy N and certain steels were
conducted in thermal convection loops. Temperature gradient mass transfer, as noted by weight losses
in the hot leg and weight gains in the cold leg, was evidenced in all tests. The weight changes of
corrosion specimens increased with increasing temperature and time.

From an operational standpoint, some difficulty was encountered in melting LiF-BeF,-ThF, salt
without mechanically failing the loop. The difficulty stemmed from the high melting point of the salt
and the high melting point of certain phases in the salt.

All the salts tested were quite compatible with Hastelloy N. Bismuth in contact with a fuel salt had
no effect on mass transfer in a Hastelloy N loop. We established that electrochemical methods to
determine the oxidation potential of molten fluoride salts could be used to predict the corrosion
behavior of a thermal convection loop. The values obtained by the electrochemical methods correlated
well with specimen weight change data. We showed that tellurium (as plated on Hastelloy N
specimens) does mass transfer in a molten fluoride "salt system and that an equilibrium between
tellurium in the salt and tellurium on the alloy can be established.

A type 304L stainless exposed to a fuel salt for 9.5 years in a type 304L stainless steel loop
showed a maximum uniform corrosion rate of 0.86 mil/year. Voids extended 10 mils into the matrix.
Chromium depletion was found.

The corrosion resistance of maraging steel (12% Ni—5% Cr—-3% Mo-bal Fe) at 662°C was better
than type 304L stainless but worse than Hastelloy N under equivalent conditions. The uniform
corrosion rate was 0.55 mil/year. Subsurface voids were seen in the microstructure of the specimens
after 5700 hr, and microprobe analysis disclosed a definite depletion of chromium and iron.

Type 316 stainless steel exposed to a fuel salt in a type 316 stainless steel loop showed a maximum
uniform corrosion rate of 1 mil/year for 4298 hr. Mass transfer of chromium and iron did occur in the
system.

For selected nickel- and iron-base alloys a direct correlation was found between corrosion
resistance in a molten fluoride salt and the chromium and iron content of an alloy. The more
chromium and iron in the alloy, the less the corrosion resistance.

INTRODUCTION

A large portion of the support work of the Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) Program involved
studies of the compatibility and mass transfer of various alloys with LiF-BeF,-based molten salts. Table 1
gives the alloys involved, the salt compositions, and the details of the tests. Many of these tests were
conducted in thermal convection loops like that shown schematically in Fig. 1. The loops are essentially

test bed systems wherein metal specimens suspended in the salt and salt samples can be removed and/or
replaced at operating temperature without disturbing flow or introducing air contamination. The salt flow
in the thermal convection loops is generated by the difference in density of the salt in the hot and cold legs
of the loop and ranges from 1.5 to 7 ft/min depending on salt density and viscosity.

A thorough chemistry background and physical properties of the molten salts are covered elsewhere by
Grimes.!

MOLTEN SALT CHEMISTRY

Uranium tetrafluoride and uranium trifluoride are the only fluorides of uranium which appear useful as
constituents of molten fluoride fuels. Uranium tetrafluoride (UF,) is relatively stable, nonvolatile, and
nonhygroscopic. It melts at 1035°C (1895°F), but its freezing point is markedly depressed by useful
diluent fluorides. Uranium trifluoride disproportionates at temperatures above ~1000°C by the reaction

AUF, = 3UF, + 1°. 3)

It is chemically unstable?-3 at lower temperatures in most molten fluoride solutions and is tolerable in
reactor fuels only with a large excess of UF, so that the activity of U° is so low as to avoid appreciable
reaction with moderator graphite or container metal.

Thorium tetrafluoride (ThF,) is the only known fluoride of thorium. It melts at 1111°C (2032°F), but
fortunately its freezing point is markedly depressed by fluoride diluents which are also useful with UF,.

Consideration of nuclear properties alone leads one to prefer as diluents the fluorides of Be, Bi, "Li, Mg,
Pb, and Zr in that order. Simple consideration of the stability of these fluorides*:5 toward reduction by
structural metals, however, eliminates the bismuth fluorides from consideration. This leaves BeF, and TLiF
as the preferred diluent fluorides. Phase behavior of systems based upon LiF and BeF, as the major
constitients has, accordingly, been examined in detail.® Fortunately the phase diagrams of LiF-BeF,-UF,
and LiF-BeF,-ThF, are such as to make these materials useful as fuels.

The binary system LiF-BeF, has melting points below 500°C over the concentration range from 33 to
80 mole % BeF,.%:7 The phase diagram presented in Fig. 2 is characterized by a single eutectic (52 mole %
BeF,, melting at 360°C) between BeF, and 2LiF-BeF,. The compound 2LiF+BeF, melts incongruently to
LiF and liquid at 458°C. LiF+BeF, melts below 280°C.

The phase behavior of the BeF;-UF,6:7 and BeF,-ThF4® systems is very similar. Both systems show
simple single eutectics containing very small concentrations of the heavy metal fluoride. ThF, and UF; are
isostructural; they form a continuous series of solid solutions.

"The binary diagrams LiF-UF,® and LiF-ThF,'? are generally similar and much more complex than the
binary diagrams just discussed. The LiF-UF, system has three compounds (none of which melt

congruently) and a single eutectic at 27 mole % UF, melting at 490°C. The LiF-ThF, system contains four
binary compounds, one (3LiF+ThF,) which melts congruently, with two eutectics at 570°C and 22 mole %
ThF, and at 560°C and 29 mole % ThF,.

The ternary system LiF-ThF,-UF,,'! shown in Fig. 3, has no ternary compounds and a single eutectic
freezing at 488°C ‘with 1.5 mole % ThF, and 26.5 mole % UF,. Most of the area on the diagram is

occupied by the primary phase fields of the solid solutions UF,-ThF,, LiF*4UF,-LiF-4ThF,, and

LiF-UF4-LiF-ThF,. Liquidus temperatures decrease generally to the LiF-UF, edge of the diagram.

The single-fluid molten-salt breeder fuel will need a concentration of ThF, much higher than that of
UF,. Accordingly, the phase behavior of the fuel parallels that of the LiF-BeF,-ThF4 system. Figure 4
gives the ternary system LiF-BeF,-ThF,; this system shows a single ternary eutectic at 47 mole % LiF and
1.5 mole % ThF,, melting at 360°C.5:7 The system is complicated to some extent by the fact that the
compound 3LiF-ThF, can incorporate Be?" ions in both interstitial and substitutional sites to form solid
solutions whose compositional ‘extremes are represented by the shaded triangular region near that
compound. Liquidus temperatures <550°C (1022°F) are available at ThF, concentrations as high at 22
mole %. The maximum ThF, concentration available at liquidus temperatures of 500°C (932°F) is above
14 mole %. Inspection of the diagram reveals that a considerable range of compositions with >10 mole %
ThF, will be completely molten at or below 500°C.

As expected from the general similarity of ThF, and UF, — and especially from the substitutional

_ behavior shown by the LiF-UF,-ThF, system (Fig. 3) — substitution of a small quantity of UF, for ThF,

scarcely changes the phase behavior. Accordingly and to a very good approximation, Fig. 4 represents the
behavior of the LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF; (MSBR fuel) system over concentration regions such that the mole
fraction of ThF, is much greater than that of UF,.

THERMODYNAMIC DATA

The success of an MSBR is strongly dependent on the compatibility of the container materials with the

molten salts used in the primary and secondary circuits of the reactor. Because the products of oxidation of .

metals by fluoride melts are quite soluble in the corroding media, passivation is precluded, and the

_ corrosion rate depends on other factors, including the thermodynamic driving force of the corrosion

reactions. Design of a practicable system utilizing molten fluoride salts, therefore, demands the selection of
salt constituents such as LiF, BeF,, UF,, and ThF, that are not appreciably reduced by available structural
metals and alloys whose components Fe, Ni, and Cr can be in near thermodynamic equilibrium with the
salt.

A continuing program of experimentation over many years has been devoted to definition of the
thermodynamic properties of many corrosion product species in molten LiF-BeF, solutions. Many of the
data have been obtained by direct measurement of equilibrium pressures for reactions such as

H,(g) + FeF,(d) = Fe®(c) + 2HF(g) @.

solution with the solute at unit mole fraction and with the activity coefficient it
would have at infinite dilution.

where g, c, and d represent gas, crystalline solid, and solute, respectively, using the molten fluoride (I) as
reaction medium. Baes has reviewed all these studies’ > and, by combining the data with the work of others,
has tabulated thermodynamic data for many species in molten 2LiF+BeF,. Table 2 records pertinent data
for the major components of MSRE and MSBR fuels and for corrosion products in molten 2LiF-BeF,.

From these data one can assess the extent to which UF;-bearing melt will disproportionate according to
the reaction

4UF3(d) = 3UF4(d) + U(d). 6)

For the case where the total uranium content of the salt is 0.9 mole % (as in the Molten-Salt Reactor
Experiment), the activity of metallic uranium (referred to the pure metal) is near 107% with 1% of the
UF, converted to UF; and is near 2 X 107'° with 20% of the UF, so converted.!®> Operation of the
reactor with a small fraction (usually <2%) of the uranium present as UF; is advantageous insofar as
corrosion and the consequences of fission are concerned. Such operation with some UF3 present should
result in formation of an extremely dilute (and experimentally undetectable) alloy of uranium with the
surface of the container metal. Operation with >50% of the uranium as UF; would lead to much more
concentrated (and highly deleterious) alloying and to formation of uranium carbides. All evidence to date
demonstrates that operation with relatively little UF; is completely satisfactory.

METAL CORROSION

Nickel-base alloys, more specifically Hastelloy N and its modifications, are considered the most
promising for use in molten salts and have received most attention. Stainless steels, having more chromium
than Hastelloy N, are more susceptible to corrosion by fluoride melts but can be considered for some
applications. |

Oxidation and selective attack may also result from impurities in the melt,

or oxide films on the metal,

NiO + BeF, ~> NiF, + BeO, oo | (10)

followed by reaction of NiF, with M.

Reactions (8), (9), and (10) will proceed essentially to completion at all temperatures within the MSBR
circuit. Accordingly, such reactions can lead (if the system is poorly cleaned) to a rapid initial corrosion
rate. However, these reactions do not give a sustained corrosive attack. ’

Reaction (7) with UF,, on the other hand, may have an equilibrium constant which is strongly
temperature dependent; hence, when the salt is forced to circulate through a temperature gradient, a
possible mechanism exists for mass transfer and continued attack. Reaction (7) is of significance mainly in
the case of alloys containing relatively large amounts of chromium.

If nickel, iron, and molybdenum are assumed to form regular or ideal solid solutions with chromium (as
is approximately true), and if the circulation rate is very rapid, the corrosion process for alloys in fluoride
salts can be simply described. At high flow rates, uniform concentrations of UF; and CrF, are maintained
throughout the fluid circuit. Under these conditions, there exists some temperature (intermediate between
the maximum and minimum temperatures of the circuit) at which the initial chromium concentration of
the structural metal is at equilibrium with the fused salt. This temperature Tgp is called the balance point.
Since the equilibrium constant for the chemical reaction with chromium increases with increasing
temperature, the chromium concentration in the alloy surface tends to decrease at temperatures higher than
Tgp and tends to increase at temperatures lower than Tgp. At some point in time, the dissolution process
will be controlled by the solid state diffusion rate of chromium from the matrix to the surface of the alloy.
In some melts (NaF-LiF-KF-UF,, for example) the equilibrium constant for reaction (7) with chromium
changes sufficiently as a function of temperature to cause formation of dendritic chromium crystals in the
cold zone. For MSBR fuel and other LiF-BeF;-UF, mixtures, the temperature dependence of the mass
transfer reaction is small, and the equilibrium is satisfied at reactor temperature conditions without the
formation of crystalline chromium. Thus, the rate of chromium removal from the salt stream by deposition
at cold-fluid regions is controlled by the rate at which chromium diffuses into the cold-fluid wall; the
chromium concentration gradient tends to be small, and the resulting corrosion is well within tolerable
limits. A schematic of the temperature gradient mass transfer process is shown in Fig. 5.

Division. Although starting materials of very high purity were used in production of fused fluoride
mixtures, further purification was needed before the salts were used in loop systems. Two steps were
required: one for the removal of oxides and sulfides and one for the removal of metallic fluorides. For the
blanket and fuel salts, the oxides and sulfides were removed by gas sparging for several hours (usually 10 to
20) at 650°C with an anhydrous mixture of HF in hydrogen (1:4). The purification reactions are of the

~ type
0%2~ + 2HF = 2F~ + H,0." : Co 0

The process is continued until the same amount of HF leaves the reaction vessel as enters. The reaction is
then considered complete. Co

Gas sparging of the melt at 700°C with hydrogen alone for several hours (usually 20 to 40) was used as
» the final phase of the purification process to reduce FeF, and NiF, concentrations to low values and to

\&/

remove any residual HF:

H, + MF, =M® + 2HF. Q)

The reduction of CrF, by hydrogen is too slow to be effective at process temperatures. However, the

chromium concentration of the starting materials is very low. The by-product of the hydrogen sparging is

HF, and the process is continued until the HF evolution is below a certain level.

MATERIALS SELECTION AND FABRICATION

The Hastelloy N material for loops 15, 16, 18, 19, and 21 was from heat No. 5097 obtained from

Stellite Division, Cabot Corp, and the composition is given in Table 3. The loops were fabricated from
0.750-in.-OD annealed tubing with a wall thickness of 0,072 in. Machined pieces were annealed at 1175°C
in H, before welding. The material was TIG welded in conformance with ORNL Specifications PS-23 and
PS-25 and inspected under ORNL Specification MET-WR-200. After welding, the loops were stress relieved
at 880°C for 8 hr.

LOOP OPERATIONS

The loops were heated by pairs of clamshell heaters placed end to end around two legs of the loop (Fig.
1). The input power was controlled by silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) units, and the temperature
controlled by a current proportioning controller. The loop temperatures were measured by Chromel-P vs
Alumel thermocouples that had been spot welded to the outside of the tubing, covered by a layer of quartz
tape, and then covered with stainless steel shim stock. Tubular electric heaters controlled by variable
autotransformers furnished the heat to the cold leg portions of the loops during startup of the loops.

Before filling with salt, the loops were degreased with ethyl alcohol, dried, and then heated to 150°C
under vacuum to remove any traces of moisture. A helium mass spectrometer leak detector was used to
check for leaks in the system.

The procedure for filling the loops consisted of heating the loop, the salt pot, and all connecting lines to
approximately 550°C and applying helium pressure to the salt supply vessel to force the salt into the loop.

Air was continuously blown on freeze valves leading to the dump and flush tanks to provide a positive salt

seal.
Normally the first charge of salt was held for 24 hr in the loops at the maximum operating temperature

“and then dumped. This flush salt charge was intended to remove surface oxides or other impurities left in

the loops. The loop was then refilled with fresh salt, and operation began. Once the loop was filled, the
heaters on the cold leg of the loop were turned off. As much insulation was removed as necessary to obtain
the ‘proper temperature difference by exposing the cold leg to ambient air. Helium cover gas of 99.998%

- purity and under slight pressure (approx 5 psig) was maintained over the salt in the loops during operation,

ox

With the exception of loop 1258 which only had specimens in the hot leg, the loops all contained 14 to
16 specimens 0.75 X 0.38 X 0.030 in., each with a surface area of 0.55 in.? (3.45 cm?). Generally two of
the specimens were titanium-modified Hastelloy N. (Modifications to the standard Hastelloy N composition
were made to test for improved mechanical properties after neutron irradiation.) The composition of the
standard and modified Hastelloy N specimens is given in Table 4. Eight specimens were attached at
different vertical positions on each of two ¥-in. rods. One rod was inserted in the hot leg and another in
the cold leg. The rods were placed into or removed from the loop from standpipes atop each leg. The rods
were moved through a Teflon sliding seal compression fitting at the top of the standpipe and a ball valve at .
the bottom. Another ball valve on the loop above each leg assured removal or insertion without disturbing
loop operation or introducing air contamination.

The corrosion specimens were withdrawn periodically along with salt samples to follow corrosion
processes as a function of time. During the removal periods all specimens were weighed and measured.

- Portions of the hottest and coldest specimens were removed and examined metallographically during tests,

and all specimens were examined metallographically after test.

RESULTS
Hastelloy N

Loop 15. Loop 15 was operated to determine the compatibility of a proposed blanket salt for a

~ two-fluid molten salt breeder reactor with Hastelloy N. Figure 6 shows loop 15 on the left in place before

operation.

For loop 15 the fuel pot and associated lines had to be heated to 730°C and higher than normal inert
gas pressure applied to fill the loop with salt. During the initial salt transfer the fill line failed and resulted
in a spill. After repairs, we managed to fill the loop with the flush charge but found it impossible to initiate
circulation even after heating the loop’s hot leg to 760°C. The loop was drained and then refilled with clean
salt and put into operation. The loop was operated at a maximum temperature of 676°C with a
temperature difference of 54°C. A helium cover gas under slight positive pressure (~35 psig) was maintained
over the salt in the loops during operation.

On May 1, 1968, after 2003 hr of uneventful operation, the loop cooled due to a blown fuse, and all
salt was frozen. Heat was applied to the loop in order to thaw the salt, and a rupture occurred in the hot leg
loop piping 30 in. down from the hot leg surge tank (Figs. 7 and 8), thus ending the operation of loop 15.

The weight changes of the specimens in the hottest and coldest positions are plotted vs time of
operation in Fig. 9. The standard Hastelloy N specimen at a lower temperature lost more weight than the
titanium-modified specimen at the higher temperature. We attribute this increased corrosion resistance to
the lower iron concentration of the titanium-modified alloy (Table 4). Weight losses were measured for hot
leg specimens and weight gains for cold leg specimens, thus implying that temperature gradient mass
transfer had occurred. The weight changes in all cases were quite small.

Fig. 9. Weight changes of Hastelloy N specimens in loop 15 vs time of operation in LiF-BeF,-ThF4 (73-2-25 mole %).

Figure 10 shows microstructures of the specimens in the hottest and coldest positions, respectively.
There is little or no indication of corrosion or mass transfer effects.

The salt was periodically analyzed for its major constituents, the major alloying elements of the
container material, and oxygen and water. The chromium and iron increased with time, but the changes
were very small (about 20 ppm increase). Nickel showed a small overall increase, molybdenum remained at
<20 ppm during operation, oxygen ranged from <50 to a high of 244 to a value of 75 ppm just before the
rupture, and water was <500 ppm in each analysis. The latter four values are quite low and preclude any
possibility of air or water contamination.

Table 5 gives pertinent details of loops that had operated in past years for various times with LiF ThE,
(71-29 mole %) salt. The two Inconel loops that operated for a year (8760 hr) showed subsurface void
formation for distances up to 6% mils, but the INOR-8 (Hastelloy N) loop that operated for a year showed
no voids. The improved behavior of INOR-8 was somewhat expected since there is less chromium present.
None of the loops showed any signs of plugging, and no large increases of any of the alloy constituents are
noted in the salt. Our experiment substantiated and quantified the previously observed good behavior of
Hastelloy N in LiF-ThF, salts.

From the operational viewpoint, this salt provided more difficulties than any other fluoride salt that has
been handled by the present Reactor Materials Group personnel. The first problem was the high
temperature (730°C) needed to transfer the fuel and the apparent presence of unmelted salt constituents. It
is thought that there was perhaps a separation of a high melting component which caused this problem. The
second problem was the rupture of the loop while trying to thaw the frozen salt. This thawing procedure
had been used with other salts quite successfiilly with no failures.

Loop 15A. The ruptured area of loop 15, which still contained frozen salt, was cut from the loop and
another piece of tubing was attached by means of compression-type fittings. The loop was then heated, the
salt was melted and dumped, and the test specimens were removed. The temporary fitting was removed,
and the joints to be welded were reamed to remove any remaining salt and corroded metal and filed to
provide the proper weld joint configuration. Welding was done in conformance with ORNL specifications

PS-23 and PS-25 and inspected under ORNL specification MET-WR-200. The first welding attempt was
unsuccessful because of poor penetration from excessive gas pressure in the loop. The second attempt was
successful and demonstrates that a successful weld can be made on material that has contained a molten
salt. oo

The loop was filled with salt from the original batch and designated 15A. After operation began,
specimens were found to have a “glaze” or coating (probably a high-melting thorium compound) that was
impossible to remove without damaging the specimen. However, based on changes of chromium
concentration and metallographic studies, little if any mass transfer was indicated. Toward the end of the
run the coating on specimen surfaces disappeared, and the weight changes were measurable. For a total
specimen exposure time of 37,792 hr, the maximum weight loss was 4.7 mg/cm?, equivalent to a uniform
corrosion rate of 0.05 mil/year, and the maximum weight gain was 4.2 mg/cm?. Figure 11 shows the
microstructure of the hottest and coldest specimens. Some attack along the grain boundaries of the hottest
specimen is seen. ’ )

Loop 18 and 19. Loops 18 and 19 were constructed of standard Hastelloy N with removable specimens
in each leg and were operated with the salt mixture 68% LiF—20% BeF,~11.7% ThF,—0.3% UF, (mole
%). Loop 19 had a molybdenum hot finger containing bismuth at the bottom of the hot leg (Fig. 12) which
allowed contact between the flowing salt and the bismuth. The loops were operated to obtain data on the
compatibility of a fertile-fissile salt mixture with Hastelloy N and to determine if contacting the salt with
liquid bismuth would affect the corrosion rate.

After a power outage at 4741 hr the bismuth finger on loop 19 was inadvertently heated to
temperatures over 1000°C. Subsequent examination disclosed localized melting of the Hastelloy N which
surrounded the molybdenum container. Portions of the loop and the finger were removed for examination
and replacement parts fabricated for repair. oo

Prior to the 4741-hr shutdown the maximum weight loss for a standard Hastelloy N specimen at 704°C
was 0.8 mg/cm?. Assuming uniform dissolution this weight loss is equivalent to 0.07 mil/year, an
insignificant corrosion rate. The chromium content of the salt increased from 25 to 66 ppm while iron
decreased from 78 to 23. Figure 13 shows the metallographic appearance of the hottest and coldest

specimens. Little attack or deposition is seen. The bismuth content of the salt was <20 ppm for the last
1500 hr. After the temperature excursion the salt and the bismuth at the top of the finger were both
analyzed for certain metal impurities, and the results are given in Table 6.

Table 6 shows that bismuth extracted impurities from the salt in quantities proportional to the
solubility of these structural metals in bismuth. Analysis of the dumped salt from loop 19 disclosed 225
ppm bismuth. :

At the time of this analysis, in loop 18 the maximum weight loss of a standard Hastelloy N specimen
was 0.8 mg/cm? at 704°C in 3400 hr, a very low rate, equivalent to 0.08 mil/year assuming uniform attack.
The chromium concentration in the salt in this loop had increased from 21 to 90 ppm. We showed no
difference in mass transfer in the two loops at this time.

The specimen from the hottest position of loop 19 was bent around a %-in.-diam tube and examined
metallographically (Fig. 14). There was no indication of cracking or weakening of grain boundaries, and
there were no signs of salt or bismuth attack.

alloy. The ‘chromium content of the salt increased 194 ppm in 18,000 hr, while iron decreased 70 ppm; and

small specimen ‘attachment pins dissolved ‘during'the run, and the specimen fell off the stringer. As we had
surmised earlier in loop 19, the bismuth in contact with the salt appearéd to have had no effect on our mass
transfer results as loops 18 and 19 showed about the same amount of mass transfer (Fig. 16).

Loop 21. Loop 21, a Hastelloy N thermal convection loop (Fig. 17) with removable specimens in each
leg and containing the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment reference fuel salt (Table 1), operated for 13,798
hr. The loop was equipped with electrochemical probes which measured the U%*/U*" ratio, and hence
provided an instantaneous measure of the oxidation potential of the salt. The probes were designed and
operated by J. M. Dale and A. S. Meyer of the Analytical Chemistry Division. Previous use of these probes
had been limited to small static systems, and this experiment was intended to evaluate their possible use for
on-stream analysis in a large system. This loop differed from our other thermal convection loops in that the
salt flow up the hot leg went directly into a large surge tank. In our other loops the salt was circulated only
through tubing which was in a harp-shaped configuration, From the large surge tank the salt then flowed
out the bottom of the tank into a crossover leg and into the cold leg. The electrochemical probes passed
through mechanical fittings (separated from the metal by Teflon), which were on risers 10 in. from the
surge tank (to protect the Teflon from the heat of the salt) and then entered the salt in the large hot leg
surge tank, as shown in Fig. 18. There were five access ports for the probes.

The loop was filled on July 20, 1971, and held under isothermal conditions at about 650°C until July
26, at which time the cold leg temperature was established and Hastelloy N specimens were inserted into
both the hot and cold leg of the loop for corrosion studies. Analyses of the U** concentration of the melt
were started on July 22 and were continued on a routine basis until the specimens were removed from the
loop on August 23. More details about these analyses can be found in refs. 15, 16, and 17.

The original measurements in the melt indicated that about 0.02% of the total uranium was present as
U*. The U* concentration showed a gradual increase until a value of 0.05% was reached at 475 hr of loop
operation. At this point the rate of formation of U* increased, and the concentration reached a value of
about 0.15% when the metal specimens were removed from the loop. The maximum weight loss of a hot leg
specimen was 0.2 mg/cm?, and the maximum weight gain of a cold leg specimen was 0.05 mg/cm?.

To evaluate whether material floating on the salt was affecting the potential measurements, the
electrode assembly was modified to allow the salt to be flushed from around the electrode with helium.
This assembly was installed in the loop after the metal specimens were removed. The electrode was encased
in a Y%-in. nickel tube, open at the bottom, which protruded below the surface of the melt. During
computer-controlled runs the salt entered the electrode compartment from below the melt surface and
remained there for the time of measurement. The salt was then flushed from the compartment, and the
electrode remained in a helium gas envelope when not in use. This appeared to keep floating material away
from the electrode and also should have increased the lifetime of the electrodes or electrode area-defining
insulators which may be added at a later time. :

After the system was started the analyses were e performed unattended through computer control. At
initiation of the analyses a signal from a logic circuit that we added to the computer started a timer which
caused the pressure in the electrode assembly to be released, and salt entered the electrode compartment.
The computer then operated the voltammeter to perform five analyses for U*, and the results plus some
diagnostic information were printed out on a Teletype after each analysis. At the end of the run the average
U* concentration and standard deviation were calculated and printed out. When the run was completed,
the timer shut off causing the salt to be flushed from the electrode assembly. As an example of the
precision of the analysis systém, a standard deviation of 2.1% was obtained for the results of the hourly
analyses made over a one-weekend period when the U%* concentration appeared to be relatively stable.

Fig. 18. Upper portion of loop 21.

The percent of the total uranium which was present as U¥ for the first 3600 hr of loop operation is

shown in Figs. 19-21. The irregular appearance of the data at 600 hr was due to large temperature

fluctuations in the electrode tank. The first measurements with the shielded electrode were made at 1200

“hr and are plotted as the squares in Figs. 19 and 20.

At about 1250 hr it was first noted that analyses with the shielded and unshielded electrodes gave
different values of the U* concentration. This was later shown to be an effect of the nickel tube around
the shielded electrode and not to a difference in the electrode response. At 2350 hr the nickel tube shield
was raised out of the melt, and the measurements with the two electrodes were in agreement as shown in
Fig. 20. RET Co EEE

The second time the specimens were removed was November 29, 1971. The specimens had been
exposed a total of 2513 hr, and the maximum weight loss was 0.2 mg/cm? while the maximum weight gain
was 0.05 mg/cm?. The last time the specimens were removed was February 8, 1972. The total exposure
time was 4169 hr, and the maximum weight loss was 0.23 mg/cm? , which would correspond to a corrosion

rate of 0.02 mil/year, assuming uniform material removal. The chromium content of the salt increased 40
ppm. Except for the first time, when the U* concentration was already at a low value, the insertion of the
metal specimens appeared to introduce an oxidant which caused a decrease in the U* concentration (1316
hr on Fig. 20 and 3200 hr on Fig. 21). Special precautions were taken for the next specimen insertion to
determine if this operation could be performed without oxidizing the U%. At 1725 hr the shielded
electrode, which had previously been removed for examination, was put back into the loop without
immersing it into the salt. As shown in Fig. 20, the U3* concentration decreased and then rapidly recovered,
probably due to dilution effects caused by the salt flow.

~ In summary, the results of the ratio measurements generally showed excellent reproducibility and were
consistent with the known factors of loop operation. Despite certain operational problems such as the
offset in the potential of shielded electrodes, smaller offset voltages observed between the reference and
working electrodes, and the establishment of accurate calibrations for the determination of corrosion
products, experience with this test system gives confidence that this relatively simple transducer system can
be widely applied to other test systems and ultimately to in-line reactor streams.

Loop 16A. Loop 16A was operated to determine the kinetics of tellurium transport in a temperature
gradient loop system where the tellurium is introduced as a metallic coating on Hastelloy N. The reason for
the experiment was the discovery of cracks in stressed Hastelloy N that had been exposed to fuel salt in the .
MSRE,'® and subsequent evidence that tellurium entering salt as a fission product could cause cracks of
this nature. The test bed for this experiment was a Hastelloy N thermal convection loop that had previously
operated ~38,000 hr as loop 16A with the fuel mixture 65.5% LiF—34% BeF;—0.5% UF, (mole %).
Operating conditions for loop 16A are noted in Table 1.

For the initial experiment (which lasted 3400 hr), a Hastelloy N specimen coated with 1.6 mg/cm?
tellurium was added to the normal complement of standard Hastelioy N specimens. In the first 1300 hr of
operation the weight loss of the tellurium-coated specimen equaled the amount of tellurium coated on the
specimen. In the last 2100 hr the weight loss of the tellurium-coated specimen was the same as the hottest

Hastelloy N specimen located in a neighboring position at the same temperature. Thus, all the tellurium was
apparently removed in the first 1300 hr. Half the tellurium removed was found in the salt and half on a
specimen in the cold leg. These results indicate that tellurium has some solubility in the salt and is capable
of being redistributed by temperature-dependent mass transfer. The specimens were removed from the loop
and were stressed and examined metallographically for cracks. No cracks were found.

We then placed radioactive tellurium-coated Hastelloy N specimens in the hot and cold leg of the loop
and we used weight change measurements and radioactive analysis to monitor the movement of the
tellurium. The isotope used was ! 27™Te, and it was electroplated on the specimens. Specimens were placed
in the vapor space, in stagnant salt, and in the circulating salt of the loop. The specimens were removed
after 42, 159, 396, 701, 1318, and 1792 hr exposures. We expected no corrosion of the Hastelloy N by the
fuel salt in these time periods, so all weight changes were attributed to movement of the tellurium.

After the first 42 hr in the loop, all specimens lost at least 66% of their initial activity. Our standard
specimen which had remained at room temperature in air lost 4% of its activity. After 159 hr in the loop,
all specimens had lost 75% of their initial activity. The standard specimen had lost 8%. In the next two
weighing and measuring periods, we saw an increase of activity on the cold leg specimens and a continued
decrease of activity on the hot leg specimens. In the last two examination periods, there were almost no
weight or activity changes. Weight changes correlated quite well with the activity measurements; specimens
in the hot leg lost weight, and specimens in the cold leg gained weight.

Therefore, after large initial activity losses, we observed mass transfer of tellurium from the hot leg to
the cold leg analogous to our normal movement of chromium in a Hastelloy N—salt system. In a Hastelloy
N system, until an equilibrium between the salt and the alloy is established at one point in the system, all
points of the loop lose material. After this equilibrium is established at the balance point, losses are seen in
the hot leg accompanied by gains in the cold leg. The tellurium in this system behaved in somewhat the
same manner.

Type 304L Stainless Steel

Loop 1258. Loop 1258, constructed of type 304L stainless steel (11.07% Ni, 18.31 % Cr, 0.028% C, bal
Fe) and containing removable corrosion specimens in the hot leg, operated nine years (80,000 hr) and thus
provided long-term stainless steel—fuel salt compatibility data. An LiF-BeF, -ZrF4-UF4-ThF, (70-23-5-1-1
mole %) salt circulated in the loop at a maximum temperature of 688°C and a minimum temperature of

~ 588°C. The loop with its one surge tank is seen in Fig. 22. Corrosion specimens were present in the hot leg

only. i

The loop was started July 29, 1963. Four of ten specimens were removed October 31, 1963, after 2244
hr exposure and are pictured in Fig. 23. The weight losses were 11.6, 11.3, 8.1, and 3.3 mg/cm?. In terms
of uniform material removal, the maximum corrosion rate was over 2 mils/year. Figure 24 shows a
micrograph of a specimen removed after 15,000 hr at 680°C. We see a maximum of 2 mils grain boundary
penetration. In January 1967 after approx 30,000 hr, the remainder of the original specimen set was
removed, and a second set, consisting of ten new specimens, was placed in the hot leg. The hottest specimen
was replaced after 3700 hr, and the rest of the specimens remained in the loop (periodic removals for
examination) until its shutdown. The specimen exposed at the highest temperature, 688°C, was removed
for detailed metallurgical analysis after 5700 hr (between May 1967 and February 1968). Figure 25 shows
all the specimens at this time (9400 hr exposure). No gross corrosive effects are evident. The microstructure
of the hottest specimen is seen in Fig. 26. Voids extend into the matrix for a maximum distance of 2.5 mils
along grain boundaries. The microprobe analysis of this specimen for chromium and iron is shown in Fig.
27. Note that the chromium concentration of the alloy is decreased for a distance of 28 um. Thus
chromium depletion does appear to be occurring in this system. ’

After 62,600 hr operation of the loop (September 1970) we replaced the heaters and thermocouples of
the loop. Operation of the loop had become increasingly difficult as heater and thermocouple failures
became more frequent. When the heaters were removed, we found many green chromium oxide crystals on
the loop exterior directly under the heaters. These crystals were the result of a fairly common phenomenon
in Nichrome-wound heaters where chromium, because of its high vapor pressure, is selectively vaporized
from the heater wire over a long period of time. This vaporization changes the heating characteristics of the

wire and certainly contributed to some of our operating problems. The salt was successfully thawed and
loop operation continued.

The weight changes of the second specimen set after 32,000 hr are seen in Fig. 28. Note the dependence
of weight loss with time and temperature. The microstructures of three specimens after 45,724 hr salt
exposure are shown in Fig. 29. Voids exténd for at least 10 mils into each specimen. At loop shutdown the
second specimen set had been exposed to the salt for 49,057 hr. The maximum weight loss was 95.9
mg/cm?, equivalent to a uniform corrosion rate of 0.86 mil/year.

For both specimen sets, the weight losses and depth of void formation increased approximately in
proportion to the one-half power of the operating time. This suggests that the corrosion process was
selective toward chromium and was controlled by the solid-state diffusion rate of chromium.

Maraging Steel

Because of interest in iron-base alloys with lower chromium contents for possible containment of
molten salts, we tested a maraging steel (12% Ni—5% Cr—3% Mo—bal Fe) specimen in loop 1258. The
specimen was annealed 1 hr at 800°C and air cooled. Table 7 compares the weight loss and corrosion rate of
this specimen with type 304 stainless steel and Hastelloy N under similar conditions of exposure. As
expected, the maraging steel showed better corrosion resistance than the stainless steel because of its lower
chromium content. However, the corrosion behavior of the Hastelloy N was still superior to both.

Figure 30 shows the metallographic appearance of the maraging steel specimen after exposure for 5700
hr at 662°C. Most of the attack is manifested as surface pitting, but there are also subsurface voids such as
were seen in the stainless steel specimens of this loop. The void formation is attributed to removal of
chromium atoms from the surface. This results in a concentration gradient and causes like atoms from the
underlying region to diffuse toward the surface, thus leaving behind a zone enriched with vacancies. In time
these vacancies accumulate and form visible voids.

The specimen of maraging steel was examined using the electron-beam microprobe.!® Using an
accelerating voltage of 20 kV and specimen current of 0.01 pA, x-ray intensities were recorded (Fe Ka, Ni
Ka, Cr Ka, and Mo La) in both as-received and corroded specimens. Since x-ray intensities of a given
element are directly related to the weight percent of the element, a comparison of intensities should reflect
the change in composition in the attacked zone in the corrosion specimen. Table 8 shows the comparison
for each of the four elements. Figure 31 shows the cathode ray tube display and corroborates the
quantitative data. One can see the depletion of iron and chromium and the increase in nickel. Molybdenum

' seems to remain about the same.

Type 316 Stainless Steel

Loop 22. Loop 22 was a type 316 stainless steel thermal convection loop which operated for 4491 hr
with a LiF-BeF,-ThF4-UF, salt mixture identified in Table 1. The harp portion of the loop was 1-in.-OD
tubing with 0.109-in. wall thickness. The material was from heat X-22662, U.S. National Tube, and the
ORNL Inspection Engineering Number was IR-9141, Y-12 No. 8194. The nominal composition of the alloy
was 16.6% Cr, 13.6% Ni, 2.25% Mo, bal Fe. The loop was operated to determine the compatibility. of
stainless steel with a well-purified fuel salt. The weight changes of the specimens as a function of position
and temperature are given in Fig. 32. Figure 33 shows the microstructure of the hottest specimen after
1410 hr. Subsurface voids are seen for a distance of 1 mil. After 2842 hr exposure the specimen at 650°C
had lost a total of 6.2 mg/cm? , equivalent to a uniform corrosion rate of 0.96 mil/year.

The main corrosion reaction in this system is 2UF, + Cr = CrF, + 2UF;; thus, in order to determine if
we could decrease the mass transfer of the stainless steel, we added UF; to the salt after the 2842-hr

exposure measurements to make the salt less oxidizing. In the next 645-hr time period the mass transfer

was somewhat less, and the overall corrosion rate was 0.83 mil/year. In the final 811-hr time period, the
weight loss of the hottest specimen increased such that the uniform corrosion rate was >1 mil/year.
However, the overall mass transfer, as evidenced by weight changes of other corrosion specimens, remained
quite low.

The average uniform corrosion rate for the hottest specimen was 1 mil/year for the entire 4298-hr
period of loop operation. Figure 34 shows the microstructures of hottest and coldest specimens at the end
of the run. Figure 34a shows a 100X cross section of the specimen with voids extending about 1 mil into

the etching reveals a 3-mil-wide affected area. This complete area is probably depleted of chromium. Figure

34d shows the specimen in the coldest position (560°C). Some deposits are seen.

Other Alloys

Loop 18A. After a problem resulting from a heater short to the loop tubing, loop 18 was drained and
the hot leg replaced. New salt was added, and the loop was designated 18A. The operating conditions for
loop 18A are listed in Table 1. We placed several alloys with improved resistance to cracking by tellurium in
fuel salt in the loop (NCL-18A) to determine their relative compatibility. Tables 9 and 10 show the alloys
tested, their compositions, and the total weight change. Figure 35 shows the time dependence of the weight
changes. The weight change results show a correlation between corrosion resistance and alloy constituents
that form stable fluorides. There is, of course, a rather good correlation between weight changes and
chromium or iron content. The nickel-base alloys are far more resistant to corrosion than the iron-base

alloy. It is not possible to obtain absolute corrosion information from a test with so many materials

present, but the detrimental effects of increasing chromium and iron are obvious. If the loop had been
constructed entirely of one of the test alloys, the corrosion rate of the alloy might not have been as large as
we noted in our experiment. The less-corrosion-resistant material always suffers in comparison with the
corrosion-resistant material when they are in the same system.

‘The microstructures of the alloys are shown in Fig. 36. No attack is seen on the Hastelloy N, and there
is little attack on the Inconel 600. You will note a layer of deposit on the Monel with voids underneath.

Since the composition of the Monel alloy is most unlike that of any of the other alloys, it is reasonable to
assume that after some initial attack, some material deposited on the Monel by an activity gradient transfer
mechanism, thus causing the weight gain that we measured. Thus the Monel was not quite as corrosion
resistant as our weight changes showed. The cross-section view of the Inconel 606 is unusual since at one
end of the specimen we see heavy attack while at the other end almost no attack. This corrosion specimen
was not placed any differently in the loop, so its behavior is not completely understood. We would suspect
that there might be a homogeneity problem in the specimen. The attack of the Inconel 601, Inconel 690,
and the Incoloy 811E was more straightforward and resulted in large areas of void formation: 5 mils for
Inconel 601, 15 mils for Inconel 690, and 18 mils for Incoloy 811E.

CONCLUSIONS

1. Temperature gradient mass transfer, as noted by weight losses in the hot leg and weight gains in the
cold leg, was evidenced in all systems tested. :

2. The weight changes of corrosion specimens increased with increasing temperature and time.

3. Some difficulty was encountered in melting LiF-BeF,-ThF, salt which was frozen in a loop. The
difficulty stemmed from its high melting point and the high melting point of certain phases in the salt.

4. Repairs and welds were made on tubing which had been exposed to molten fluoride salts.

5. All the salts tested were compatible with Hastelloy N.

6. Bismuth in contact with a fuel salt had no effect on mass transfer in a Hastelloy N loop.

7. We established that electrochemical methods to determine the oxidation potential of molten
fluoride salts could be used on a thermal convection loop. The values obtained by the electrochemical
methods correlated well with specimen weight change data.

8. We showed that tellurium (as plated on Hastelloy N specimens) does mass transfer in a molten
fluoride salt system and that an equilibrium between tellurium in the salt and tellurium on the alloy can be
established.

9. A type 304L stainless steel exposed to a fuel salt for 9.5 years in a type 304L stainless steel loop
showed a maximum uniform corrosion rate of 0.86 mil/year. Voids extended into the matrix for 10 mils.
Chromium depletion was found.

10. The corrosion resistance of a maraging steel (12% Ni—5% Cr—3% Mo—bal Fe) at 662°C was better
than type 304L stainless but worse than Hastelloy N under equivalent conditions. The uniform corrosion
rate was 0.55 mil/year. Voids were seen in the microstructure of the specimens after 5700 hr, and
microprobe analysis disclosed a definite depletion of chromium and iron.

11. Type 316 stainless steel exposed to a fuel salt in a type 316 stainless steel loop showed a maximum
uniform corrosion rate of 1 mil/year for 4298 hr. Mass transfer did occur in the system.

12. For selected nickel- and iron-base alloys a direct correlation was found bétween corrosion
resistance in a molten fluoride salt and chromium and iron content of an alloy. The more chromium and
iron in the alloy, the less corrosion resistance.
