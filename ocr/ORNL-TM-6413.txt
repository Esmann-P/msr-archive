SUMMARY

Research and development studies of molten-salt reactors (MSRs) for
special purposes have been under way since 1947 and for possible applica-
tion as possible commercial nuclear electric power generators since 1956.
For the latter, the previcdus.emphasis has been on breeding performance and
low fissile inventory to help limit the demand on nonrenewable natural re-
sources (uranium) in an expanding nuclear economy; little or no thought
has been given to alternative uses of nuclear fuels such as proliferation
of nuclear explosives. As a consequence, the conceptual designs that
evolved (e.g., the ORNL reference design MSBR) all favored enriched 23%u
as fuel with an on-site chemical processing facility from which portions
of that fuel could be diverted fairly easily. With the current interest
in limiting the: proliferation potential of nuclear electric power systems,
a redirected study of MSRs was undertaken in an effort to identify concep-
tual systems that would be :attractive in this situation. It appears that
practical proliferation-resistant MSRs could be designed and built, and
this report describes a particularly attractive break-even breeder that
includes an on-site chemical reprocessing facility within the reactor pri-

mary containment. -

The point of departure for this study (as for other recent MSR
studies) was the ORNL reference design MSBR, which in many respects,
reflects the state of MSR technology at the end of the reactor:development

program in fiscal year 1976. This reactor was ‘characterized by a moderate

breeding ratio (V1:07), a low specific inventory of fissile ‘fuel [v1.5kg/

“'MW(e)], a reasonable fuel ‘doubling time: (V20-years), and almost no plu-

tonium from ‘the fuel cycle. This performance was ‘to be ‘achieved: through

‘the use of fuel highly enriched in 2%%U and 23%U (v72%) in a high-power-

density cote and an on-site fission-product-cleanup system witha 10-day

fuel processing cycle: -Two important steps ‘in this processing cycle were

(1) the isolation of the enriched uranium ‘from, and ‘its subsequent return

to, the fuel salt and (2) the isolation of 2%%Pa for decay to 2%3U outside

“the reactor neutron flux to prevent counterproductive neutron captures in

 
 

vi

the protactinium at the high flux levels* in the reactor. Both of these
steps, along with the ready availability of excess bred fuel, were perceived
“to contribute to the proliferation sensitivity of the reference concept.
A preliminary study was undertaken ‘late in calendar year. 1976 to see

-"1f ‘the reference MSBR concept could be modified to significantly enhance
"its proliferation resistance. Among the modifications considered were
elimination of the breeding gain, a reduction in power density (and spe-
cific power) so that protactinium isolation could be avoided without ex-
i cessive penalties, and several conceptual variations in the fuel processing
cycle. Reduction of the fissile uranium enrichment (i.e., denaturing)

was not considered at that time because of perceived problems with the:
‘attendant plutonium production. The net conclusion -of this study ‘was

that, while some enhanced proliferation resistance could be achieved, :
the reference MSBR concept probably could not be made sufficiently re-
sistant to allow its deployment outside areas that would be "secure"
against diversion of fissile material or proliferation.

In a minor extension of the above study it was shown that, if MSRs
were confined to "secure" areas, they could also be used to produce power : .
from fission of plutonium (generated by other reactors) and to convert
thorium to 2%%U for subsequent denaturing and use at dispersed sites.
Since the confinement of MSRs exclusively to "secure' sites did not ap-
pear to be desirable, no further consideration was given to. concepts
without denatured uranium.

The current study of proliferation-resistant systems is based on the
premise that MSRs would be attractive for dispersed deployment if :they
could operate with denatured uranium fuel, have good resource utilization
.characteristics, and require no fuel reprocessing outside the reactor -.
primary containment envelope. A number of molten-salt concepts may meet
these requirements, but the one that currently appears most attractive,
is a system with denatured fuel and a net effective lifetime breeding
ratio of 1.00. This implies that, once such a reactor were supplied with

‘ Not related to proliferation, but a potential technical problem, was
the fact that portions of the moderator graphite in the MSBR core would

a fissile fuel charge, it and succeeding generations of hardware could
operate indefinitely with no further addition of fissile material. Addi-
tions and removals of fertile material — both ?3°U and 2%2Th — and other
salt constituents would, however, be required to maintain a stable chemical
composition.

- Break-even breeding in a denatured MSR is achieved by making several
changes in the reference design MSBR concept. First, changes were made in
the reactor core size and salt-graphite configuration to lower the core
power density and to enhance neutron resonance self-shielding in the 238y
in the fuel. These changes increased the fuel specific inventory somewhat
(to about 2.4 kg fissile uranium plus 0.16 kg fissile plutonium per electric
megawatt), but they also: reduced the neutron losses to fission products
and 233p, and captures in 238y to help compensate for the reduced breeding
performance imposed by the presence of the 238y denaturant. In addition,
the lower neutron flux associated with these changes would extend the life
expectancy of the moderator graphite in the core to approximately that of
the reactor plant, thereby obviating the need for periodic graphite re-
placement. It would also substantially ease the graphite design constraints
and allow for simpler geometric shapes. Although the neutronic calculations
indicate that this reactor could operate indefinitely with the assumed
chemical processing system, there is relatively little margin for error.
However, a substantial margin could be provided by allowing the addition
of small amounts of 235U (well within the denaturing limit) with the fertile
238y, and some additional margin probably could be obtained by adjusting
the nominal core design and/or the fuel processing cycle.

Aside from the core nuclear concept, the other substantial change
from the reference design MSBR is in the area of chemical processing.

The requirement for break-even breeding would impose a need for continuous
chemical processing, but the cycle time apparently could be increased to
"20 days (from 10 days for the MSBR). However, a more significant change
would be the elimination of the steps. to isolate 233py in order to avoid
the loss to waste of plutonium. Since plutonium, the transplutonium
actinides, and fission product zirconium all follow the protactinium, this
change not only would preserve the plutonium required for neutronic sur-

vival, but also avoid chemical isolation and accessibility of proliferation-

 
 

viii

attractive materials. (An additional step would then have to be:provided
‘in the process to remove zirconium on some reasonable time schedule.) The
change actually would eliminate part of the reference flowsheet since -.
the extracted protactinium and its companion nuclides would be returned:
directly to the fuel salt. With the exception of the zirconium-removal
step, the modified process would involve the same chemical unit operations
proposed for the reference MSER system. Thus, this process should be no
more difficult to develop and implement than that for the reference concept.
Preliminary study suggests that no changes to the reference design
MSBR ‘other than those described above for the core and chemical plant
would be required to transform the MSBR into an attractive proliferation-
resistant concept. It appears that a commercial prototype of such a  .
system could be developed and in operation in about 30 years if a de-.

- velopment effort were established.’

UTILIZATION WITHOUT PLUTONIUM SEPARATION

ABSTRACT

Molten-salt reactors (MSRs), because of the fluid nature
of the fuel, appear to provide an attractive approach to ef-
_ ficient fuel utilization in the Th- 233y cycle as well as a
means for limiting the availability of plutonium and the
general proliferation risks associated with nuclear power
generation.

High-enrichment 233 systems could, in principle, be oper-
ated with positive breeding gains to effectively eliminate
plutonium as a nuclear fuel. However, such systems would be
proliferation sensitive. Concept modifications (short of de-
naturing the uranium fuel) can be conceived to enhance the

- proliferation resistance of high-enrichment MSRs, but it is
doubtful that sufficient enhancement could be achieved to make
the systems suitable for deployment other than at "secure" sites.

Denaturing the uranium in an MSR introduces some plutonium
into the fuel cycle and generally degrades its breeding perfor-
mance. Nevertheless, a denatured MSR with full-scale on-site
“fuel reprocessing appears to be capable of break-even breeding.
In addition, the plutonium (most of which is consumed in situ)
would be of poor quality and would never be isolated from all
other undesirable nuclides. "Thus, such systems would provide
for efficient utilization of uranium resources in a prolifera-
tion-resistant environment while limiting the amount of plutonium
(and transplutonium actinides) that would have: to be handled as
waste. . Poo
The development of commercial MSRs by carly in the. 21st
century appears to be’ technologically feasible.

- INTRODUCTION

* The interest in limiting the distribution and availability of ex-
plosives-usable special nuclear materiale (SNM), particularly plutonium,
along with a recognized need for optimum ‘utilization of nonrenewable
‘energy sources, has led to a reexamination of the Molten-Salt Reactor
(MSR) concept as a potential candidate for resource-efficient nuclear

electric power generation within these constraints. Prior studies of

 
 

this concept had established it as a neutronically. feasible nuclear
breeder in the Th-233y system, but its ‘proliferation resistance was not
considered. In the current study, an effort is being made to retain
favorable nuclear performance of the reactor while enhancing its pro-
liferation resistance to a level that may make it attractive for wide-

spread deployment as a nuclear power system.

The criteria for Judging the proliferation resistance of a given
nuclear power: concept have not: been fully established, but some of the
properties of the "ideal" nuclear, system are readily’ apparent. First,
such a system should avoid the. isolation of plutonium (of whatever iso-
topic composition) as a pure material anywhere in the reactor cycle, in-
cluding the fuel cycle. Second, the system should limit to the extent
possible the inventory of SNM. at explosives-usable isotopic compositions,
regardless of its chemical impurity or unavailability. Finally, ‘the
system should provide reasonable safeguards for any: SNM that might be
transformed (e.g., by isotope separation) into’ material that could be used
for explosives. Another factor that has not been heavily emphasized is
that, since the current generation of light-water reactors is producing
a substantial amount of plutonium, there may be some advantage in a system
that could. in: an appropriately safeguarded manner consume that plutonium

to obviate the need for its long-t erm, safeguarded storage.

A variety of molten-salt reactors may be described which would have
most of these properties in varying degrees. The basic reference design
MSER, ! developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, could for all practi-
cal purposes ‘eliminate plutonium as a nuclear fuel. . However, such a

system would require highly enriched uranium, a comparably attractive

nuclear explosives material, as a fuel. If appropriately safeguarded fa-
cilities could be provided, MSRs could be used to transform plutonium to
233g (which can be denatured) while efficiently using the plutonium fis-

sion energy. Such systems could range from 233

°U fuel factories, which
would require continuing plutonium fueling, to MSBRs or denatured MSRs in
which plutonium might be used only as a startup fuel. . But possibly the

most attractive proliferation-resistant MSR concept is a denatured 2%%U

system with a very limited internal plutonium inventory. Current studies
indicate that such a system could produce all its own fuel requirements

and have otherwise favorable technological features.

- BACKGROUND

The study and development of MSRs was begun at ORNL in 1947 as part
of the U.S. Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Program. This effort led to the
construction and operation of a 2.5-MW(t) MSR [the Aircraft Reactor Experi-
ment (ARE)] in 1954. Although the effort to develop an aircraft propulsion
unit was subsequently abandoned, the potential of MSRs for civilian power
production was recognized and a development program directed toward that

goal was established in 1956. This effort led to the design, construction,

and operation of the 8-MW(t) Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE). Cri-

tical operation of the MSRE spanned the period from June 1965 to December
1969, during which the reactor accumulated over 13,000 equivalent full-

power hours of operation and demonstrated remarkably high levels of opera-

bility, availability, and maintainability.? The reactor was fueled

initially with a mixture of 235y and 23% which was subsequently removed

(on site, by fluorination of the salt mixture) and replaced by 233U, thus

making it the first reactor to operate at significant thermal power with

this fuel. During the latter stages of reactor operation, a few hundred

‘grams of plutonium was added to. the reactor to demonstrate its compati-

bility with the salt mixture. ..

Subsequent .to the operation of the MSRE, some conceptual design work
was continued toward a Molten-Salt Test Reactor and a commercial-size
Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR). However, most of the program effort

was directed toward further development of MSR technology, Emphasis in

. the design study was on moderately high breeding performance and a minimal

specific fissile inventory for the system. These objectives led.to a

~.1000-MW(e) reference design’ with _ a fissile inventory of only 1.5 kg/MW(e)

and. a compound doubling time of “19 years..

+... The apparently favorable characteristics of the HSER attracted some
industrial and utility interest; this led to the formation of the Molten-

Salt Group, headed by Ebasco Services, Inc., and including several prominent

 
 

u. 5. corporations. This group carried out some design studies? and as-
sessments of the ORNL work (under subcontract) as well as some indepen-
dently funded studies. a - Co

All AEC-supported work on the MSR concept was interrupted in early
1973; the program was terminated and all subcontracts were canceled. The
technology development effort was resumed in early 1974 (no conceptual
design work) and ‘terminated again in mid-1976. One result of that effort

was ‘a comprehensive program plan® for the ‘development of MSRs. - The cur-

“rent study is part of the Department ‘of Energy's Nonproliferation Alterna-

tive Systems Assessment Program, which was established in ‘support of
"President Carter's Nuclear ‘Policy. ‘Statement’ of April 7, 1977.
Molten-salt reactors, in common with essentially all fluid fuel con~
“cepts, have ‘a number of characteristics which may prove valuable from the
"standpoint of ‘nonproliferation of nudlear ‘explosives. Since the fuel is
“a fluid, essentially all fuel fabrication ‘and refabrication steps are
éliminated from the reactor fuel’ cycle, Thus, at ‘least in principle, it
should be possible to carry out completely remote operations within the
primary containment of the reactor ‘system. ‘This would eliminate ‘all ‘direct
access to ‘the fuel constituents. Co - BEE
Since the fluid fuel ‘also contains fission products, the entire pri-
mary circuit (including the fuel processing facility) is highly radioactive
and ‘therefore not easily modified for diversion of fissile materials.’ Any
such modification would require remote procedures which, even with exten-
sive preparation and preplanning, would be difficult, time consuming, and
"expensive. Clandestine modification of the facility would be essentially
impossible because of the high radiation levels inside the primary con-
tainment. Co
‘Molten-salt reactor systems as a ‘class, particularly those treated
- here, ‘have many features in common. All are thermal reactors with unclad
graphite as the neutron moderator and all use the same nominal salt mix-
tures and the same conceptual balance-of-plant design. Differences among
concepts are primarily in the details of the fuel-salt composition (e. 8.»
‘uranium concentration and isotopic composition) and in the on-line fuel-

cleanup concept.

HIGH-ENRICHMENT MSRs

The principal advantages of high-enrichment MSRs are their favorable
nuclear performance in thermal spectra and their near-complete avoidance
of plutonium; their principal disadvantage is the need for "secure" siting
due to the proliferation attractiveness of the highly enriched uranium
fuel. In the equilibrium fuel cycle, with no 2%%y in the initial loading,

the fuel contains a emall amount of 238p,, and almost no higher actinides.

ORNL Reference Design MSBR |

 

Prior concepts of high-enrichment MSRs are typified by the ORNL
reference design MSBR, shown schematically in Fig. 1 and described in
some detail in Ref, 1. This design (breeding ratio = 1.07) resulted from
an effort to restrict the. reactor fissile inventory [1.5 kg/Mi(e)] in
order to maximize the conservation of uranium in an expanding, but ulti-
mately limited, . nuclear economy. - Somewhat. higher breeding ratios could
have been’ obtained at the expense of higher inventories and correspondingly

longer fuel doubling. times.

Reactor system

The primary feature: in the MSBR design is a high-power-density, well-

thermalized, graphite-moderated ‘reactor in which a single molten salt con-
taining both fissilé and fertile material’ serves as ‘both the fuel and

blanket fluid. The two. major neutronic: functions (energy. production and

breeding) are achieved with a low fuel inventory by varying the fluid

fraction from about 13 vol z in the. core region to about 37 vol 7Z in the

 

The £luid fuel consists essentially of a molten mixture of ‘LiF and
BeF2 containing appropriate quantities of “ThE, and UFy In a homogeneous
solution. {The molten fuel 1e pumped from: ‘the | .core to heat exchangers where
heat generated by fission (and other related nuclear processes) is trans~
ferred to a molten secondary (or coolant) salt, a eutectic mixture of NaBF,

and NaF.* The secondary salt transports the heat to the steam supply

 

*This mixture has frequently been called "sodium fluoroborate."

is thereby confined to the reactor primary containment. system. The
secondary salt also serves to intercept tritium migrating through the
heat exchange system toward the steam circuit.

The high degrees of radiological, chemical, and thermal stability
of the inorganic fluoride salts and. their low vapor pressures permit the
operation of MSRs at relatively high temperatures (the nominal reactor
outlet salt temperature is about 975 K) and correspondingly high~tempera-
ture, high-efficiency (nominally 44%), steam-electric power cycles. In
fact, the high melting temperatures of the salts (e.g., the liquidus
temperature of the fuel salt is 775 K) require that these reactors be
operated near the higher portion of the usual temperature range for fission
power systems. This high-temperature operation requires the use of high-
temperature design and systems technologies and also allows the use of

established high-temperature steam-power technology.

Fuel reprocessing

The fuel processing plant, or fisgion-product-cleanup system (Fig.
2), of the reference design MSBR is conceived to operate continuously on

fission product poisons for discard as waste. In addition, it removes
233pa from the’ "fuel mixture and accumulates it within the processing plant
where it can decay to high-purity 233 without: further exposure to neutrons.
(Minimizing protactinium losses through. neutron capture is particularly
important at the high power density of the reference design MSBR and much
less important ‘in designs that operate at lower power densities.)

All the fission product species do not, go to the processing plant;
krypton and xenon are removed by sparging with helium in the reactor. The
seminoble and noble metals rapidly deposit on surfaces within the reactor
vessel and the primary heat exchanger; of these elements, only niobium ap-
pears to plate preferentially on the surface, of the ‘graphite moderator.
Tritium diffuses through the heat-exchanger tube valle into the NaBF,-NaF
coolant, where most of it is retained.’ )

Most of the separations are accomplished by selective extractions of

Zr, U, Pu, Pa, the rare earths, and Th are extractable in that order. %??
Such reductive extraction processes from fluoride fuel can effectively
separate uranium from protactinium (but not from zirconium) and protactin-
ium from the rare earths and thorium. Rare-earth fission products are par-
tially extracted from molten fluoride mixtures by bismuth containing
moderate concentrations of lithium, but they are accompanied by an appre-
ciable quantity of thorium. Separation of thorium from rare earths (and
from Y, Ba, Sr, Cs, and Rb, which behave similarly) must be accomplished
by transferring all these elements (except thorium) to molten LiCl from
the bismuth-lithium alloy.5»1%»1!

Uranium can be separated and recovered by reductive extraction, but
fluorination to UFsg 1s more effective and convenient. The UF¢ and F2 are
absorbed in a sufficient quantity of purified fuel solvent containing
UF4.%*% Uranium in this solution is reduced to UF, with Hp, and the re-
constituted fuel salt is returned to the reactor after final cleanup and
adjustment of the average uranium valence to about 3.99; Br, I, (and
probably SeFg and TeFg), which are volatilized with the UFg, pass through
the sorber and must be removed from the off-gas stream.

A small processing plant is sufficient. The reactor fuel passes
through the plant every ten days with a processing rate of 55 em®/s (0.87
gpm). Table 1 summarizes the removal methods and cycle times anticipated
for such a plant.’ The several separations required are well demonstrated

in small-scale experiments, but engineering-scale demonstrations are still

largely lacking, and materials. to contain both molten fluorides and bismuth

alloys seem certain to pose some problems.

Nonproliferation attributes

Once placed in operation, the reference design MSBR would .require no

: shipments of fissile material to the reactor and only occasional shipments

“of bred ‘excess 233y to fuel other ‘reactors. Accordingly, it would present

a very Low, and perhaps acceptable, ‘profile toward diversion by subnational
or terrorist groups. However, as far as weapons proliferation — a national
decision to exploit the machine to produce nuclear weapons — such a reactor

has pronounced and obvious weaknesses. The uranium within the fuel is

clearly usable material for weapons, and its removal in relatively pure
form by fluorination could be accomplished with little difficulty by use

of the available processing system. Of course, such an action would be

an overt and obvious treaty violation (the reactor could no longer furnish
power), but given suitable other preparations the "warning time" could

be quite short. Less obvious (and probably more insidious) routes for
proliferation are, in principle, available. The reference MSBR produces
more 233g than it requires; this 233g is generated in quite pure form in
the protactinium accumulation system and is available via fluorination with
the installed processing gear. Attempts. to remove it secretly should be
obvious to an inspector, but successful removal would be undetectable for

a moderately. long period. It is probably easy to underestimate the dif-
ficulties in such scenarios. , The presence of appreciable quanitities of
232g and of more than traces of fission products will add to the difficul-
‘ties, but a well-planned and determined effort could obviously surmount
them. As a consequence, the reference MSER would seem more vulnerable

than most reactor types to rapid results from an overt proliferation action

and would offer significant opportunities for covert action.

Reference Design Variations

Because of the perceived proliferation sensitivity of the reference
design MSBR, a brief study'? was undertaken in the fall of 1976 to deter-
mine whether the basic concept could be modified to make it sufficiently
proliferation resistant: for: wide deployment. as a power; producer. The re-
‘quirement: for a positive breeding gain: was eliminated, but the high-
enrichment fuel composition was retained to completely avoid the need to
deal with plutonium. ' The only other change: considered in the reactor was

a lower power density (higher fissile specific inventory) to reduce the

.: gignificance of neutron absorptions in 2%3Pa .(if Pa isolation were aban-

'i..doned) and; to eliminate the need for periodic replacement: of: moderator

-... graphite in the reactor core. Five variants of the basic system, including

‘the fission-product-cleanup concept, were considered.?
= ...The first variation modified the ‘reactor performance capability and
eliminated the breeding of excess fissile material. Such a system would

have all the proliferation resistance (or sensitivity) of the reference

 
12

concept ‘but would lack the potential for" continuous’ removal of fissile’
fuel while maintaining reactor operation.

The second variation eliminated all fluorination-steps — the most
proliferation-sensitive procedure in the entire fuel-cleanup process.’
This would prevent the isolation of 2%3Pa and would require more isotopi-
cally separated 'Li, since uranium removal prior to fission-product clean-
up would be accomplished by reduction with lithium. It appeared that fuel
self-sufficiency could be maintained in such a system with a reduced
reactor pover density (to limit Pa losses and reduce the relative poison-
ing effect of other fission products) and a significantly longet fuel
processing cycle. The longer processing’ cycle would also reduce the re-
quirement for "Li. The elimination of the fluorination steps was felt to
represent a ‘significant increase in proliferation resistance. _

The third variation involved a major change from the nominal f1ssion-
product-cleanup concept; it was proposed to substitute a CeF3 ion exchange
system for all the chemical fission-product-cleanup operations. (Gas
stripping to remove xenon and other volatile fission products would be
retained.) Such a system would remove only the rare earths (by substi-
tuting Ce, which has a lower neutron cross. section) and leave a variety
of other fission products in the salt. Some degradation in breeding per-
formance would be experienced, but it appeared that self-sustaining opera-
tion could be achieved at the lower:core power density. Since this
process completely avoided separation of the fissile material, it appeared
to be significantly more proliferation resistant ‘than the reference concept.
However, the technical feasibility of this approach has not been demon-
‘strated,: and ‘substantial research, development, and demonstration -(RD&D)
would be required to reduce it to practice if it is feasible... .

The use of some form of vacuum distillation for fuel cleanup was
proposed as a possible fourth approach to enhance the proliferation resis-
tance of the reference reactor concept. Although such an approach would
eliminate many of the proliferation-sensitive steps, it was not clear ‘that
it would be workable with a salt containing ‘thorium.:' The technological
uncertainty of this approach tended to rate it relatively low among the
possible alternatives.

The final alternative considered was the elimination of all on-site
cleanup processes other than physical removal of noble gases. The poten-
tial feasibility of this approach was based on some earlier studies of
high-performance converter. MSRs in which the unprocessed fuel charge was
- simply. replaced every few years. It appeared that, if reactivity varia-
. tions could be managed, such a system might require replacement of: the

fuel charge only two (or possibly three) times during the life of a
reactor plant.’ Although such changes would require the application of
additional safeguard measures, the infrequency of the changes was judged
to make this approach reasonably acceptable.

Although some of the processing modifications to the high-enrichment
concept appeared to be clearly technically feasible and all provided some
enhancement of the proliferation resistance of the reactor, it did not
appear that the antiproliferation gains were of sufficient magnitude to
‘justify an extensive effort to develop the reactor and the associated
fuel-cleanup system. Consequently, nondenatured MSRs for power generation

at dispersed sites were not considered further.

Plutonium Transmuter for 23%U Production

-It may be that any high-enrichment MSR would have to be located at
a site where special safeguards would be in effect and thus special-purpose
MSRs might also be acceptable. Of particular interest in this regard would
be MSR systems that consume plutonium and higher actinides (produced by
other reactors) and produce ?%%U for denaturing and subsequent utilization
at dispersed sites.
or ‘Thermal or near-thermal téeactors' (which include MSRs) are inherently

‘Thus, any advantages MSks might have as "fuel factories" would be. related
“to their fluid fuel.* :
© The net production capability would be a major, but not the only,
‘criterion for evaluating "fuel factory" options. Other significant cri-
“teria would include the technological feasibility of the concept, indus-
trial'acceptability, commercialization potential, safety and reliability,
licensability, time to commercialization, and the probable net cost of
the product. Molten-salt reactors have not:been seriously considered

heretofore as safeguarded producers of 233U; perhaps they should be.
DENATURED MSR

. MSR systems containing substantial amounts of 2°°U have not been
considered in most prior studies because of the perceived difficulties
in,dealing with the plutonium that would be produced. In addition, such

+ systems would not be compatible with the high breeding performance and
low inventories that have been among the traditional system goals.. How-
ever, with the current emphasis on proliferation resistance and ultimate
resource utilization in fission energy systems, MSRs fueled with denatured
uranium may have significant overall technical advantages. The denatured
MSR -(DMSR) described in the following subsections is based on a preliminary
conceptual study of this system. It is anticipated that a more precise
and detailed description will be evolved as the study is continued.

General Characteristics

The principal characteristics desired in a DMSR are @) that it meet
to the maximum extent practicable the currently perceived requirements. for
‘resistance to proliferation of nuclear explosives and (2) that ic provide
for, a very ‘high level of resource utilization. }

“a few years and is independent of whether startup was on 2350 or 2%3y,

238 4g present in the mixture to dilute the 233y by 6:1 and the 235y by
4:1, . Additional denaturing is provided by the 23*U and 2%®U in the steady-
state mixture to achieve the preferred dilutions for nonproliferation.
Although substantial plutonium is produced from the 2%%U, the high neutron
cross sections of the plutonium isotopes and the fact that all plutonium
- 1s retained in the fuel salt keep the total plutonium inventory relatively
low; about- 10% of the fissile material is plutonium (239 and 241 isotopes).
The long effective exposure time of the plutonium results in the buildup
of substantial amounts of 2*°Pu and 2“?Pu. Although these isotopes have
significant fission cross sections (particularly at high neutron energies),
they also undergo spontaneous fission (i.e., produce neutrons), which tends
to detract from their value as explosives materials. In addition, there
is no provision for the isolation of plutonium from a number of other
radioactive and otherwise undesirable nuclides. One other potentially
attractive material is 233Pa, which is present to about 84 kg in the fuel
salt at steady state. If this material could be isolated from the rest
of the fuel, it would eventually produce high-purity 2230, which would be
proliferation ‘sensitive. However, protactinium isolation is not part of
‘the conceptual system, and modification of the system to provide for such
“isolation would be difficult, time consuntng, expensive, and readily de-
tectable.

Utilization of all natural resources in the denatured system appears

‘to be quite favorable. Significant amounts of ‘LiF (and hence beryllium

 

“and thorium fluorides)* must be continuously removed from the fuel salt
“as "Li 1s added in the fission-product-cleanup system; however, these
materials could be recovered by a variety of aqueous processes if it were
economically attractive to do so. “The effective breeding ratio can be
maintained at 1.0, so that, after the initial fissile loading, no fissile

“material need be ‘added or removed for the life of the plant; however, thor-

“fym and 23%U must be added’ ‘continuously to maintain the concentrations of

these nuclides.” At the end of plant Tife, ‘only’ a small amount of addi- i

“tional uranium would have ‘to be added to that recoverable from the old

These materials must all ‘be included as potentially ‘limited natural

“plant (to substitute for plutonium that is not recovered) to start up
‘a new plant. Alternatively, the entire salt charge from a retired plant
(including in-salt fission products, plutonium, and higher actinides)

could be transferred to a new plant with no new fissile addition and no
plutonium left over for storage or disposal.

The basic reactor flowsheet for the DMSR is essentially the same as
that for the reference design MSBR.. The only differences are in the core
..configuration, details of the fuel-salt composition, and the fission-

. product-cleanup (chemical processing) system. Thus the primary-system
temperatures, pressures, and major flow rates, as well as. the entire
“secondary ‘system and balance of plant, would be the same as for the refer-
-ence plant. The remainder of this section is devoted to those portions of

the denatured concept that have not been described previously.

Reactor Characteristics

 

The principal criterion for an attractive DMSR is survival in a
neutronic sense. It is axiomatic that adding 238y to a thermal spectrum
MSR degrades its overall breeding performance because the plutonium that
is produced has a lower effective fission neutron yield than 233g in such
a system. In addition, it was recognized that protactinium isolation
would not be acceptable and that neutron and bred 233U losses due to
neutron captures in 233pa would have to be accommodated. Thus, the nuclear
design problem became one of balancing a low core power density (to limit
protactinium losses and graphite heating) against a higher fissile inven-
tory in a core of reasonable size and balancing a more heterogeneous
(Lumped) core (to limit neutron absorptions in 23%) against potential
cooling problems in large moderator elements.

One of the first requirements established for. the DMSR was the need
for break-even breeding. This requirement probably applies to all denatured
fluid-fuel reactors and to any other systems in which the entire fuel

charge has one homogeneous composition.* The actual "critical point" for

 

*In such systems it is not possible to upgrade the average core en-
richment by removing below-average (depleted) fuel and adding near-average
(but still denatured) material.

 
 

17

operating feasibility occurs when the fractional rate of production of
fissile isotopes equals that of consumption of fissile isotopes with ap-
propriate consideration of the rate of burnup of fertile material. At
this point it becomes possible to sustain reactor operation indefinitely
by additions of denatured fuel. For denatured feeds containing 13% 233%
in 230y and 20% 235y in 2387, the minimum acceptable MSR conversion ratios
are 0.98 and 0. 97, respectively. However, such systems would be signifi-
cantly less attractive than a true break-even reactor in that they would .
require ‘transport of ‘substantial denatured fissile material to the site.

A DMSR must have an effective f1ssion-product-removal system and must
use the plutonium produced from 2385 efficiently to achieve break-even
breeding over its lifetime. The plutonium and protactinium, as well as
uranium, must be removed from the fuel before rare-earth and other fission
products ‘can be removed. Accumulation of 233p, for decay outside the
| reactor (as was planned for the reference MSBR) could not be permitted for
the DMSR’ since it would make high-quality 233y available with moderate
ease. It is convenient to remove plutonium and protactinium together from
the fuel and to reintroduce ‘them immediately to purified fuel solvent for
return to the reactor. Such retention of ?3%pa in the reactor tends to
lower the tolerable neutron flux (and the power density) to limit losses
of 2393p," by neutron capture. This decreased power density increases the
fissile specific taventory for the system but also has some favorable
effects.

1. if the neutron flux must be reduced, it is reasonable to reduce ’
it to values that limit ‘irradiation damage in the core graphite such that
the graphite lifetime is equal to that of the reactor, thus eliminating
the need for scheduled moderator replacement. ]

C20 At the lover neutron flux, the xenon poison fraction for a given
"" %enon concentration is reduced, thereby possibly eliminating the need to
impregnate” the’ graphite’ ‘surfaces to reduce their permeability to gases.
U3, ‘The attendant lower graphite power densities lead to lover tem-
perature rises in the graphite, ‘thereby substantially easing the design
constraints on moderator elements.

4, The poison fraction associated with the shorter-lived fission

products is somewhat reduced, providing slightly more margin for operation.

 
 

18

Core configuration

Consideration of the ‘above factors led to the selection of a nominal .
reference reactor ‘concept with the characteristics described below.
1. A cylindrical reactor about 10 m in diameter by 10 mn high, in- -
cluding the reflector. The core size is determined primarily by the
neutron damage flux to the graphite with little influence (at these large
sizes) from criticality or conversion ratio. Hence, effective flux flat-
tening in the core might allow selection of a smaller reactor size or a ‘
longer graphite life with minimal reactivity penalty.
| 2. A nominal fuel fraction in the core zone of about 13%, subject
to optimization and minor spatial variations (axial and radial) for flux
flattening. }

3. Absence of a high-fuel-fraction "blanket" zone, comparable to

‘the 37% salt zone surrounding the core in the reference design MSBR. This
zone was used to help limit neutron leakage in the original breeder con-
cept.

4, Simple cylindrical design (25 cm OD) for the graphite moderator
elements with relatively large-diameter (v5-cm) central fuel passages.
Refinement of the design might lead to modification of these properties.

This basic reactor design appears to meet the neutronic and thermal-
hydraulic requirements of the system while providing latitude in several
areas (core size, fuel fraction, and moderator-element size and shape) for
adjustment of the system performance to cover uncertainties.

In addition to the above features, the reactor would include salt

“inlet and outlet plenums (between the core and reflector) at the bottom
and top of the core that would be characterized by high fuel-salt volume
fractions. A similar, though smaller, salt zone would be present between

the core and reflector in the radial direction to accommodate the differ-
ential thermal expansion between the metal reactor vessel and the graphite
moderator. (The reflector is attached to the vessel so ‘that it moves
outward as the vessel expands on heatup.) The effects of these zones are

included in the conceptual design.

Neutronic properties

Nuclear composition and the basic fuel cycle. The reference graphite
and fuel characteristics and compositions are shown in Tables 2 and 3.
The isotopic composition of the actinide component of the fuel at equilib-
rium depends on the refueling policy, the removal process, and the flux-
averaged cross sections. The fuel circulation is rapid, so that fuel
everywhere in the core can be assumed to have one composition.

After startup, the basic refueling policy is to add thorium con-
tinually in the amount required to hold the concentration constant and
to add 2%%U as required to satisfy the "denaturing inequality," N23g; >
6N2 33; + 4N235; » where N refers to nuclear number density. The actual
amounts fed at equilibrium, assuming a 0.75 capacity factor for a 1000-
MW(e) plant, are 601 kg of thorium and 116 kg of uranium per year. Thorium

either depleted or natural uranium ‘could be used with only insignificant
differences. (Pure 238; was assumed. in these. studies.)

A fission-product~cleanup process much.like that described for the.
reference design MSER (see also Table 1) is presumed to operate contin-.
uously to remove materials from the fuel salt. A 20-day processing cycle
was assumed for the denatured system (vs, 10 days for the reference MSBR),
so that effective removal times from Table 1 are approximately doubled for
those elements* whose removal is a. function of the processing cycle, Other
differences from the reference cycle that arise from changes in the nominal

: +
reprocessing concept are:

© “1. The 2%%Pa remains with the fuel: salt.indefinitely rather than *
being isolated on the nominal 20-day processing. cycle. : :

2. The transplutonium actinides are recycled into the fuel salt.

3. Selenium and tellurium are’ removed with the halogens on the
nominal 20-day processing cycle rather than plating out on metal surfaces
on a very short cycle. Lo

4. Fission=product zirconium, ‘because. it requires a special separa-
tion operation, is removed on a rather long (v300-day) ‘time cycle.

5. The fuel carrier-salt replacement cycle is about 7.5 years.

The breeding and burning of fissile fuel proceed. approximately as
shown in the nuclide charts (Figs. 3 to 5), which illustrate the Th-U
U-Pu, and transplutonium chains in the DMSR, respectively. Although the
actual branch fractions depend on the flux level as well as the energy
distribution of flux, these simplified chains indicate the potential for
a mixed~fuel breeder. The data shown on the figures indicate a total of
2.36 neutrons absorbed and 2.51 neutrons produced for each thorium atom
consumed in the 232g chain, while the 238y chain has a "cost" of 3.20
neutrons and a yield of 2.88. From this, we can see that a combined

neutron yield gives a small surplus to account for nonactinide losses.

The branch fractions and the Th/U chain ratio are both sensitive to
the neutron energy spectrum, as discussed later. The above equation shows
that the effect of the 238y chain is an important loss of reactivity and
that efficient use of the resultant smaller neutron yield is required.

The . overall effect of the higher transplutonium actinides is of par-
ticular interest. .The DMSR is unusual in that these nuclides are recycled
indefinitely as an alternative to including them with the waste stream.

effect on the neutron yield of the system. Data taken from a 200-year
operation study show that each atom of 240py produced from 239py is joined
by 0.11 atom produced by ¢ decay of 2*“Cm. If the additional 240p,  24lpy
and 2%?Pu reactions are taken asa“ part of the transplutonium effect, we
can characterize :the total effect as follows: For each absorption in
242py calculated without the transplutonium chain, 4.0 additional absorp-
tions, 1.0 additional fissions, and 3.2 ‘additional fission neutrons are
born. The net result is a loss of 0.8 neutron per "normal" absorption in
2862p, | CE .

The fissions in 2%5cm, 24lpy; and 247cm, in descending order, are the
largest neutron contributors ‘associated with the higher actinides. At the
low power density of this system, the o decay of 24%Cm leads to an impaired
neutron yield compared to that at ‘higher power densities. Also, the
B decay" of 2*!Pu becomes a. nontrivial loss of fissile material.

Neutron absorption in 2339p, represents a significant loss’ of reac-
tivity in this concept, since each atom would otherwise. decay to a fissile
233y atom yielding 2.2 neutrons directly for each absorption. Each ab-
sorption in protactinium leads to another | in 234g: before ‘a. fissile material
is finally produced. Higher power density would make this situation worse.

The nonfissioning capture in 235g is similarly unprofitable. A total
of three additional ‘captures are required to produce a fissile nuclide,
239py., Some of these chains would take many years to develop Fully; for
example, 23%U would saturate with a time constant of approximately 30
years. Even so, the full equilibrium value would ‘eventually be. reached.

Consideration of all these factors leads to the equilibrium fissile
inventory of the reactor. The total’ inventory of 233%y + 23%. is thus
2.4 kg/MW(e), while the fissile plutonium (2%%u + ip) inventory is
0.16 kg/Mi(e), Lo .

Neutronics results. The concentration, absorption, and fission data
corresponding to the fully developed breeding chains in the DMSR are shown
in Table 4. More than 98% of all fissions take place in 233g, 235y, 239py,
and 2*!Pu. The U/Pu fission split is 5 to 1, but the plutonium neutron

* Ihe total plutonium inventory is about 0.37 ks/miCe), so only about
43% is highly fissile.

The depression of thermal flux in. the fuel is of some interest because
it governs the allowable size of the moderator logs from a neutronics
standpoint. If the flux depression is large, . graphite and resonance cap-
ture will be enhanced. Table 5 shows that flux depression would not be

excessive in the reference core design.

The spatial peaking factors for both power density and fast-neutron
flux (E > 50 keV) have significant effects on moderator graphite lifetime
in MSRs, particularly in the low-power-density concepts where a moderator
lifetime equal to that of the reactor system is desirable. ’ The ‘power-
density distribution primarily affects the graphite temperature, which in
turn affects the amount of graphite damage for a given neutron fluence; the
neutron flux directly affects the carbon-atom displacement rate as well
as the temperature. The peak-to-average values for both power density
and neutron flux are the same in the nominal core design, both in the
radial and axial directions; the values are 1.69 and 1.35 for radial and
axial directions, respectively. The core average neutron damage flux is
3.1 x 10!3 neutrons/cm? -sec (E > 50 keV). If a fast fluence of 3 x 1022
neutrons/cm? is assumed as the limit of useful moderator life, t this value
would be reached in the highest-£lux region in 13 equivalent full-power
years (17.3 years at 75% capacity factor). Less conservatism in defining
the upper limit for damage fluence and flux flattening may allow an exten-—
sion of the useful graphite life to the desired 30 years at 75% capacity
factor.

Startup and control. The startup of the denatured system can be
accomplished with either 233y or 235y at the appropriate denaturing level.

 
 

27

The effect of the denaturing is such that either fuel will give approxi-

. mately the same performance. The initial reactivity is very sensitive to
the initial fissile loading, as shown by Fig. 6. The calculated fissile
loading required. to achieve initial criticality and overcome equilibrium

fission product loading is 2371 and 3115 kg for 23%y and 235y, respectively.

Figure 6 also shows that a 2% error in the criticality calculations could

be compensated by. a 5% change in fissile loading. |

After startup, an increase in reactivity on the order of 2.57 will
occur due to the greater effect of buildup of new fissile material over
that of fission products. Short-term reduction of reactivity could be
accomplished by withholding uranium from the input stream. A short-term

. increase could be accomplished by reducing the thorium content, although

the long-term effect of this action might be less fissile production.

Thus, reactivity increases would more likely be provided by small fissile

additions. |

Long-term breeding and nuclear design flexibility. The neutronic
“calculations indicate that the DMSR would start and run for ‘the life of the
moderator on fuel which it manufactured internally. However, more is ‘ex-
pected of it. In this ‘scenario, it’ is intended ‘that the fuel be recycled
“indefinitely in ‘a succession of new reactors as the useful life of the old
~ ones ends. This would eventually ‘lead to a buildup of ‘the "trash" nuclides
(**¢u, 237p, 238py  2%2py and the various americium and ‘curium nuclides).
of these, the data used for 2%8Py and the various ‘americium and

curiun nuclides must be described 48 estimates and are perhaps subject to
errors of 30% or more. If these chains develop as predicted, ‘the ultimate
effect would be a slow approach after many ‘years to an ‘absorption fraction.
of 0. 0633 (including plutonium ‘and’ ‘transplutoniun ‘effects) due to absorp-
tion in 23%, with a yield of 0.0377 for a net loss of 0.026. Present
’ calculations ‘Indicate ‘that a system using this fuel ‘would be no more than
barely critical if the calculations were accurate. or

What can be done if these predictions are true? What if reactivity
is even lower than predicted? Potential alternatives for increasing the
overall system reactivity include (1) altering the spectrum to improve
neutron production, (2) enriching the 23%U added, (3) altering the fuel
salt processing concept, or (4) adjusting the denaturing limit to reduce
the 2%%U additions somewhat. The potential for improvement by spectrum
modification seems attractive. Certainly the fission neutron yield is
sensitive to the energy spectrum. To illdstrate this point, Table 6 shows
a three-energy-group structure used in some of the analyses. Absorptions
in groups 1 and 2 ghow a net loss of neutrons," while there ‘is a gain in
group 3. Thus the neutron yield is sensitive to the ratio of group 2
(resonance) absorption to group 3 (thermal) absorption and thus to the
fuel/moderator ratio. The relative importance of group 1 (fast) absorp-
tions is small ‘because ‘both absorptions. and productions are much smaller
than for the other two energy groups. : Some additional information on the
spectrum effect ‘may be -obtained -by- intercomparing. the group-average neutron
absorption cross sections and the effective neutron yields for some of the
heavy-metal nuclides in this three-group structure (Table 7). For example,
it is clear from a comparison of the Th/2%%U cross-section ratios in the

resonance and thermal groups that the ratio of Th/23%U neutron absorptions

vould. be. increased. by reducing the resonance flux in relation to the ther-
mal flux... The- same would be true of the ratio of 23%y/mh absorptions. In
this.system, almost. every neutron absorption in thorium also results in a

neutron absorption in 233y;

thus, an increase in the absorption effective-
ness of 233y with reduced resonance. flux leads to a lower allowable in-
ventory of 2330 relative. to. thorium.. Since the required 238y inventory
is governed ‘principally by the amount of 233 present, this also leads to

a lower 238y loading. Both of these effects work to increase the relative

 

 

 
 

importance of the more productive Th-233y chain (as measured by the higher
weighted-average value of Nn for 233y in thie spectrum).

All these factors tend to make the neutron yield larger when resonance
flux is reduced: by: increased moderation. Acting contrary to this trend is
the ‘tendency of ‘the resonances in 238g to capture more as the concentration
is reduced. This effect does not dominate, however. A thermal spectrum
results in more’ absorption in nonactinide’ salt nuclides and. graphite.

Also, it is necessary to increase the moderator volume fraction to make
the resonance flux lower. These effects résult in more parasitic absorp-
tions, which tend to offset the beneficial effects of the more-thermal
spectrum,

In the reference MSBR, a "blanket with 4 relatively high salt frac-
tion and a harder spectrum was used around the optimum-spectrum inner core.
This tended to increase reactivity, with the fissile material being pro-
duced in a hard spectrum with low. parasitic capture and consumed in a
softer central spectrum. Although the resulting core would be more com-
plicated (and difficult to manufacture), the alternative might be accep-
table if one were required to provide the added reactivity.

Figure 6 shows the effect of enriching: the 238g makeup, ‘The amount
of 23%U added would remain as before, but some 2%%U would be added. If
the material were enriched to the nominal denaturing limit, 1% of reac-
tivity could be gained. A 50% enrichment would yield 7% of reactivity.
This would require special protection of the material added, but the
amount would be only 155 kg of fissile material per year. Enriched 235y
could also be used with somewhat inferior results. oo

Since fission products constitute only a very small reactivity loss
in this concept (cf. Table 4), the reactivity gain that could be realized
by modifying the fission-product-cleanup process probably is insignificant.
However, in the equilibrium fuel mixture, there is significant poisoning
associated with neptunium, plutonium, and the transplutonium actinides.
Thus, removal ‘of some of these materials,’ possibly between movements of
_ the salt from one reactor plant to another, could effect a significant
extension in the useful life of the fuel charge. (In the limit, the
"entire fuel charge could be consigned to storage or ‘disposal at the end

of 1ife of ‘a’ given reactor.) ‘It seems apparent, however, that this

 
 

31

approach would have an unfavorable effect on the antiproliferation at-
tributes of the concept. oo }

‘The final option — reducing the denaturing ratio — may be inferior to
the other three from an antiproliferation viewpoint, although it would not
add to the fuel cycle cost as would enriching the feed material. Allowing
the 233% denaturing factor to drop to 4 as for 233g would produce a 0.7%
increase in reactivity. Further reductions in the 238g loading would also
improve the reactivity but would decrease the proliferation resistance of
the system.

In summary, it appears that an attractive, proliferation-resistant
DMSR with break-even breeding is neutronically feasible and that suffi-
cient latitude and alternatives exist to ensure its technological success

in this area.

Core Thermal Hydraulics

The reactor core thernal-hydraulic features, particularly with respect
to graphite temperature and xenon transport to the graphite, were major
considerations in the reference design MSBR. Although the design con-
straints are considerably relaxed in this area for the DMSR, they remain
significant from the standpoint of overall technological feasibility of
the concept.

Because of the relatively low power density of this reactor concept,
simple core configurations which were not possible in the MSBR reference
design’ may be considered. Three’ simple designs were considered: (1) a
core made up of spaced graphite slabs," (2) a core made up of stacked hex-
agonal graphite blocks: with circular coolant channels, and (3) a core con-
sisting of a hexagonal array of graphite cylinders with central coolant
channels. CL we :

Constraints which must be ‘considered in’ selecting a core design in-
clude maximum graphite" element temperature, local salt volume fraction, and
the 23% self-shielding effect, ‘which imposes a minimum limitation on the
coolant channel dimensions. The" ‘temperature rise between the coolant
channel and the hot spot in’ the graphite moderator element is especially

important because of the strong dependence of graphite dimensional change

 

 

 
 

32

with temperature: The salt volume fraction and the 2%%U self-shielding
effect strongly couple the thermal-hydraulic and the neutronic core designs.
"“' ‘These combined ‘constraints appear to rule out the possibility of a
graphite slab core configuration. Mechanical problems, especially the
loss of coolant channel geometry due to shifting of the stacked hexagonal
blocks, rule out the second option. The third design seems to fill all the
“requirements and is also very appealing because of its structural simpli-
"city = which is important in a core expected to last the life of the plant.
The outer diameter of the cylindrical graphite elements would be "25 cm
and the diameter of the inner coolant channel 45 cm. This yields a salt
volume fraction of 13% and equal core salt temperature increases of 140°C
in the central and outer coolant channels, Figure 7 shows the basic core
geometry and the two types of salt flow channels (the central and the outer
channels) which are formed between the moderator elements. The 30° annular
section of moderator element used in the thermal analysis is also shown in
Fig. 7. If the heat transfer from the surfaces of this element were uni-
form and characterized by a Dittus-Boelter correlation film heat transfer
coefficient, the maximum temperature rise in the moderator at the center
of the reference core would be 60°C. The heat transfer, however, is

obviously not uniform to the outer channel because 1) the salt (which wets

graphite poorly) will not penetrate all the way to the point of contact of
the moderator elements, (2) the salt velocity near the point of contact
will be greatly diminished, and (3) regions of low salt velocity will have
temperatures greater than the channel average because >90% of the power: is
generated in the flowing salt. In addition, the Dittus-Boelter correlation
may not apply, because a thin film of helium may exist on the graphite
surfaces.

In the absence of information on salt heat transfer coefficients,
penetration depths, and turbulent velocity profiles, an estimate (probably
conservative) of the moderator temperature structure was obtained assuming
a salt film heat transfer coefficient of 0 within 15° of the point of
moderator contact and a salt film heat transfer coefficient equal to 80%
of the value obtained using the Dittus-Boelter correlation elsewhere.

With these boundary conditions, the heat conduction equation in
cylindrical finite-difference form was solved in the 30° graphite section
using the method of successive over-relaxation. Constant heat generation
and thermal conductivity within the graphite were assumed. This analysis
yielded a maximum graphite temperature 80°C above the salt temperature at
the core center and a maximum graphite temperature in the core of 740°C
at an axial location 2.1 m downstream of the core midplane.

The hydraulic diameters of the central and outer channels are 5 and
2.6 cm, respectively, which means the central channels will need to be
orificed to more nearly equalize the salt velocities and hence the salt
temperature rises in two channels. This could possibly be achieved by
machining small channels in the graphite near the inlet and outlet ends.

The possibility of spacing the moderator elements to eliminate the prob-

lems caused by low heat transfer and low salt velocity near the contact

points has been investigated, but at present ic appears ‘this would entail

a salt volume fraction significantly greater than 13% to be effective.

- Chemical Processing -
Unit processes and operations generally similar to those in the flow-

sheet for the reference MSBR can be used to process fuel from the DMSR.

Processing for the latter reactor has not yet been analyzed in detail,

 
 

34

but it is clear that the flowsheets must differ in some important aspects.
The fuel volume in the DMSR must be considerably larger, and, although the
cycle time can probably be appreciably greater than 10 days, the processing
plant will be somewhat larger than that of the MSBR. ~The DMSR will ‘contain
"a considerable quantity of plutonium which must be retained within the
reactor circuit. The MSBR system in which 2%%Pa was accumulated outside
the reactor core and allowed to decay must obviously be abandoned since
such a system would furnish weapons-usable 233 upon treatment with Fa.

Since protactinium and plutonium, along with uranium, must be removed from

the fuel solvent before yttrium and the rare-earth fission products can

be removed, the DMSR must contain a system which provides for removal of

plutonium and protactinium and minimizes proliferation opportunities by

immediately reintroducing them ‘to purified fuel solvent for return to

the reactor. Such a protactinium-plutonium reintroduction circuit has the
‘considerable disadvantage compared with the MSR plutonium accumulation

system that it also reintroduces fission product zirconium to the puri-

fied fuel solvent. However, the protactinium-plutonium reintroduction cir-

cuit has the advantage — insofar as waste management is concerned — that x
it also reintroduces americium, curium, californium, and plutonium to the
reactor fuel and permits only very small losses of any transuranium
elements to the waste streams.*

It seems apparent that the DMSR can manage the noble-gas and the semi-
noble and noble-metal fission products in the manner and with the same
removal times described earlier (see Table 1) for the MSBR. Operation of
the DMSR with 5 to 10% of the uranium present as UF3, as seems feasible,
would apparently result in sesentially immediate reduction of fission

=2 and their complete reten-

product selenium and tellurium to Se~2 and Te™
“tion (with little or no interaction with the Hastelloy N) by the fuel.

Any other seminoble and noble-metal fission products that appear appreci-
ably in the fuel stream to the processing plant could be effectively re-

moved by a simple wash with bismuth containing no reducing agent.

*of course, it is not known whether solid LiF-BeF,-ThF,; containing
fission products can be considered a suitable form for disposable waste. *
It does seem certain that very low levels of transuranium nuclides will
offer some advantages whatever the waste form. fe

35

The DMSR processing flowsheet, shown as a simplified block diagram
in Fig. 8, would recover about 99% of the uranium by fluorination to UF
and would reintroduce it to purified fuel solvent as proposed for the MSBR.
The quantity of UF¢ to be produced and absorbed per unit time would be
several-fold larger than that for the MSBR. Also, if the DMSR were operated

with 10% of the uranium as UF3, the quantities of SeFg and TeFg¢ to be

recovered by the off-gas treatment system would be ‘markedly increased.
Fission product zirconium is produced in high yield, and its removal
from the fuel is highly: desirable. Although the zirconium isotopes are

‘not important neutron absorbers, any contained zirconium must be reduced

with expensive Li and reoxidized each time the fuel is processed. It

should be possible to remove zirconium (on a cycle time of about 200

days) by partial extraction — along with a portion of the uranium, plu-

tonium, protactinium, and transuranium elements ~ in bismuth containing

a small concentration of lithium followed by selective and essentially

complete reoxidation of plutonium, protactinium, and the transuranium
elements into purified fuel solvent in a multistage operation.* The
pregnant solvent from this operation serves as the absorber solution

for the UFe. Since the zirconium-bearing bismuth solution cannot be

completely freed from the 238y.233%y mixture by selective oxidation, the

zirconium and uranium must be transferred by hydrof luorination to a

waste fluoride salt and the uranium recovered as UF by fluorination before

discard of the waste salt at a rate corresponding to about 4 moles of
zirconium per day. - A. simple method “for ‘zirconium removal on a much shorter

cycle time- would be very desirable and may be possible.”

If the partial reductive extraction of zirconium were used, the fuel
salt would then pass to a multistage extractor.where the balance of the
zirconium, uranium, plutonium, protactinium, and transuranium elements
would be recovered by extraction into a bismuth-lithium alloy at somewhat
higher lithium concentration. By use of about six countercurrent stages
with lithium in bismuth maintained at about 2.15.% 10~° atom fractionm,
the protactinium losses can be kept to completely negligible values and
the plutonium losses can be made very satisfactorily low.* The pregnant
bismuth (containing U, Zr, Pu, Pa, etc.) would be sent to the UFs re-
duction and final valence adjustment stages, where the values would be
recovered in the fuel for return to the reactor. The fuel solvent
(LiF-BeF2~-ThF, containing a very large fraction of yttrium, the rare-
earth, alkaline-earth,. and alkali-metal fission products) from this
extractor passes to the rare-earth extraction column.

‘The process for removing yttrium and rare-earth, alkaline-earth, and
alkali-metal fission products. from the fuel solvent is the same as that
proposed. and described above for the MSBR. The effective removal rates
of the several fission products depend upon the element removed and upon
the size, flow rates, and number of effective stages in the rare-earth
extraction, transfer, and stripping systems.: However, it appears that
by processing 5% of reactor inventory per day (a number that may prove
. _uneconomically. large), the rare earths and barium could be removed on a

cycle time well below 100 days. Such removal would require discarding
about 100 moles of lithium per day through hydrofluorination of the rare
earths into waste salt. Cesium could be removed with a cycle time of 100
days by discarding about 100 moles of LiCl per day. a
: ~ Since’ the quantities: of uranium, plutonium, zirconium, and trans-
‘urantum elements that’ must ‘be’ ‘reduced’ and reoxidized are much larger than
in the MSBR, “the .use’ of lithium by the DMSR- will. pe relatively large. On
a 20-day processing cycle, ‘about’ 2000. moles’ would be required as reductent

ie each day. (ith o most of - this entering the fuel)... This corresponds to about

 

© +--.-*It appears that protactinium losses could be kept to less than 25
g/year and plutonium losses to about 100 g/year in the combined zirconium-
removal system and the main extractor. . :

 
 

38

0.05 m® (1.8 £t3®) of purified fuel salt that must be removed each day.*
About 280 moles of ThFi, 7 moles of 23%UF,, and 430 moles of BeF, must be
added each day. These removals and additions constitute replacement of
"the ‘fuel solvent (LLF-BeFy~ThF4) once per 7.5 full-power years of opera-
tion.’ So

Removal of radioactive species from the several exit gas etreams
could presumably be accomplished in the manner proposed — though not yet
developed in detail — for the reference design MSBR. ‘Krypton and xenon
isotopes, along with small: quantities of salt, radioactive particulates,
and ‘traces of radioiodines, must be removed and recovered as wastes from
the reactor sparging circuit. Tritium must be recovered from the second-
ary coolant. Insofar as practicable, the several ‘streams containing HF
and Hp ‘would be ‘combined for recovery of the HF for recycle through the.
system for generation of Fz, It is clear that essentially complete
‘recovery ‘of radioiodine and radioselenium’ and tellurium from the gases
passing the UF absorption system will prove to be difficult.’

: “All in all it is certain that, even if all the systems indicated "=
above prove feasible, a great deal of development is: required before the
fuel processing plant could be designed in detail. Indeed, as indicated
in a subsequent section of this document, ‘design of the processing plant
will be further complicated by the paucity of materials of construction
that are adequately stable toward both molten fluorides and molten bismuth
alloys. i |

*This salt contains essentially the proper quantity of LiF, BeF;, and
ThF, along with some rare-earth, alkaline-earth, and alkali-metal fission
products and virtually no fissionable or transuranium isotopes. It con-
siderably exceeds the quantity needed for the hydrofluorination of waste
materials. It may be that an appreciable fraction of this could be stored
and used for startup of additional DMSRs. Alternatively, and especially
'1f solidifed: fluoride cannot be considered an ,adequate- disposable waste, it
may prove economical to recover at least the Li from the salt during its
conversion to suitable waste.

The very short cooling time for this fuel will, of course, intensify
the ‘iodine retention problem though the absénce of complications from. or-
ganic solvent—iodine interactions should be of some benefit. :

Balance of Plant

As indicated earlier, the purpose of this study is to examine the
features of a DMSR that would differ significantly from those of the
reference design MSBR. Since the fuel salt for the denatured system would
have essentially the same thermal-hydraulic properties as the MSBR fuel
salt, there is little if any basis for considering changes to the reference
system other than those described above for the reactor itself and the
the fission-product-cleanup system. Hence, the remainder of the primary-
coolant (fuel) circuit, the entire secondary circuit including the second-
ary salt, the steam ‘system, and the plant auxiliaries would be essentially
as described for the MSBR. One possible exception to this is the shutdown
cooling system and related equipment, which might be simpler for the de-
natured reactor because of the lower fuel power density. Other differences
might appear if -a detailed design were developed, but the reasons for such
~ changes would involve engineering judgment, safety analysis, and/or eco-
nomic choices rather than basic differences in the reactor concepts. As
a consequence, most of the design study work that was directed toward the

MSBR balance of plant could be _applied to a denatured system.

" MSR TECHNOLOGY STATUS

A comprehensive review! 5 of ‘the status of molten-salt-reactor tech-
nology was published by ORNL in August 1972. This document was comple-
‘mented by an AEC review of the status! ¢ which also identified a number of
technical issues needing solutions before an MSR could be successfully
‘built and licensed. | ‘When the technology development effort was resumed in
1974, work was directed ‘toward: several of ‘these issues, including the pri-
mary-system structural .alloy, chemical processing technology, and tritium
management. Significant progress. was ‘made in these areas with laboratory
demonstration of the requirements for an apparently satisfactory solution

engineering-scale tests of several parts of the chemical processing con-

cept were under way when the program was discontinued in 1976. The nature

of the technical progress that was made, in conjunction with the less-

stringent requirements of the low-power-density denatured system, suggest

that such a system could eventually be successfully developed. ‘However,
substantial time .and effort would be required to develop the MSR into a

licensable, commercially acceptable system.
