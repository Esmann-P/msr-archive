FOREWORD

This quarterly progress report of the Molten-Salt Reactor Program records the technical
progress of the research at the Laboratory, under its Contract W-7405-eng-26, on power-
producing reactors fueled with circulating fused salts. The report is divided into two
major parts: 1. Reactor Design Studies and 2. Materials Studies.

Until July 1, 1957, the Molten-Salt Reactor Program was largely a design study, with
only token expenditures for experimental work, As of July 1, the program was expanded
to include experimental work on materials. A further augmentation of the program occurred
on October 1, 1957, when personnel and facilities for additional research and experi-
mentation became available. As a result of these transitions, this quarterly report has
been expanded to include component development and testing, engineering research,

metallurgical and chemical investigations, and radiation-damage testing.

MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR PROGRAM QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

SUMMARY

PART 1. REACTOR DESIGN STUDIES
1.1. Reactor Design

Preliminary layouts have been prepared of the
molten-salt reactor system that are based on the
use of five fuel pumps and two blanket-salt pumps,
The total thermal power production is assumed to
be 638 Mw, with 90% of the power being generated
in the 8-ft-dia core and 10% being generated in the
2-ft-thick blanket, The proposed layouts are being
studied in order to achieve simplification and to
minimize the fuel inventory. Layouts of the
reactor cell are also being studied in order to
determine the best possible arrangements of piping
and other components that will provide minimum
plant size and yet facilitate remote maintenance.

The parameter study of two-region, homogeneous,
molten salt reactors was continued through nuclear
calculations on the Univac, the Oracle, and the
IBM-704, The Univac calculations indicate that,
for the same core diameter and thorium content of
the fuel salt, the U?33 inventory would be one-
half the U235 inventory. In the U?35 case the
regeneration ratio is limited to a maximum -of
about 0.675, and in the U233 case it appears to
be possible to exceed 1.0. It is pointed out,
however, that the regeneration ratio for a u23s.
fueled reactor will decrease with time as burnup

poisons accumulate, while in the u23s. fueled
reactors with initial regeneration ratios -of about |
0.6 or better the regeneration” ratio may actually
improve with time and with reasonable. chemical-"

superior U233 fuel.

Comparisons ‘of lithium-bery lium and sodium- ‘
beryllium “salts showed that the sodium-beryllium
salts ‘required 1.1 to 2 times the 23s inventory

‘required with the lithium- beryllium salts. Also; ~~
the sodium-beryl lium salts show a disadvantage of .

0.110 0.15in regeneration ratio,

Modifications were made in the Sorghum’ program ;
for the Oracle, which ‘was designed. for computing en
progressive changes “in ‘core - ‘concentration: “and
regeneration ratios. A subroutine was incorporated

 

 

for computing the constants from the concentra-
tions, absorption cross sections, initial spectrum,

Z. Temperature at pump; inlet -

Pump shaft speed. Ce

 

 

 

.and leakage probabilities. The resulting constants
reproduce the initial spectrum and critical con-
centration exactly,

A preliminary fuel fill-and-drain system design
was completed which satisfies the design criteria
in that (1) it is always in a standby condition in
which it. is immediately available for drainage of
the fuel, (2) it can adequately handle the fuel
afterheat, and (3) criticality cannot be achieved in

-- the drain system. The fill-and-drain vessel con-

sists of forty-eight 20-ft lengths of 12-in.-dia pipe
arranged in six vertical banks connected on
opposite ends with mitered joints, The system is
preheated and maintained at the desired tempera-
ture with bayonet-type electrical heaters in tubes
located axially in the pipes. Removal of afterheat
will be accomplished by radiant heat transfer to
banks of water-filled boiler tubes that will normally
be dry.

A hydrostatic bearing was designed for use in

fuel pumps which differs from the conventional

bearing in that the pockets rotate on the impeller.
A bearing of this type has the advantage that the
pressure of the pumped fluid would maintain the

“centering of the impeller in the pump casing.

1.2. Component Development and Testing

Preliminary - pump design studies have indicated

that five pumps with the following characteristics
- would be suitable for circulating fuel 130 (BeF -

nance problems, reactor operational problems, and
other considerations,

 
 

 

 

 

MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR PROGRAM PROGRESS REPORT

Facilities are being designed and constructed

for development tests of the salt-lubricated

bearings being considered for use in fused salt
pumps. The oil-lubricated bearings being used at
present are unsotisfactory because they must be
shielded from both the heat and the radiation from
the fuel salt in order to avoid damage to the
bearings and to the lubricant. Equipment is to be
set up for high-temperature tests of both hydro-
dynamic and hydrostatic salt-lubricated bearings.

Oil-lubricated mechanical shaft seals are being
studied for auxiliary system applications. Medi-
fications in purge-gas flow are being tested as a
means of preventing diffusion of process-fluid
vapor ‘into the seal region. Also, since oil-
lubricated bearings may be required for the upper
seals of the fuel pumps, tests of Dowtherm A as
a lubricant are under way, This lubricant decom-
poses into gaseous and liquid products when
irradiated, rather than into carbonaceous deposits
of the type that result from the irradiation of
hydrocarbon-base lubricants. A test of a pump
rotary element with oil-lubricated bearings is also
under way in a radiation field. Further, a bellows-
mounted ‘seal is being operated in an endurance
test in a sump pump that is circulating NaK at
1250°F.

"Techniques for remote maintenance of the com-
ponents within the reactor cell are being studied.
it is considered that the most feasible solution to
the maintenance problem is to make all components
removable and replaceable by remote manipulation,
Therefore means for remotely separating and
joining pipes are being investigated. Tests are
under way of three types of flange joints: (1) a
freeze-flange joint in which a frozen seal of molten
salt is used to prevent leakage of molten salt
through the space between the flanges, (2) a joint
which has a cast-metal seal between the flanges,
and (3) a joint in which a V-shaped tooth on each
flange indents the sealing ring.

The various types of remote-handling apparatus
now available commercially are being studied for
applicability to mointenance of this reactor sys-
tem, The remote assembly ond disassembly of a
pump in a hot cell is being attempted as a means
of studying the manipulation problems. Design
work has also been initiated on heater-insulation
units that can be remotely removed ond replaced.
Plans are being made for a large-scale demon-
stration facility in which fo test mechanical joints,

the replaceability of components, the adequacy of
heater-insulation units, the unitization of wiring
harness and service piping, and the application of
remote-viewing and -handling apparatus and tech-
niques.

A heat exchanger test facility is being operated
to obtain heat transfer correlations for predicting
the heat transfer performance of the molten salts
of interest, Experimental information is required
because the heat transfer characteristics of some
salts appear to be affected by the type of struc-
tural material used and by the wetting properties
of the salts,

Forced-circulation loops in which large tem-
perature drops can be achieved are being operated

to study the corrosion of INOR-8 and of Inconel by

the fused salts of interest, The long-time effects
are of particular interest, and satisfactory opera-
tion of a loop will imply operation for one year or
longer without significant equipment difficulties
or changes in operating conditions. Two special
loops have been constructed of INOR-8. One of
these includes graphite specimens and will be
examined after operation to determine the extent
to which graphite causes carburization of INOR-8

and the effects of the fused salt mixture on’

graphite. The other loop includes INOR-8 speci-
mens for weight-loss studies.

A forced-circulation loop is also being assembled
that will be operated ina beam hole in the MTR.
Operation of the loop will provide information on
fuel stability and corrosion of INOR-8 under
irradiation at simulated reactor conditions.

1.3. Engineering Research

Three entrance-exit systems proposed for the
core of the molten salt reactor are being studied
in glass models. Preliminary qualitative data on
flow patterns and velocity profiles have been ob-
tained through visual observation and photographic
recording of the motion of phosphorescent particles.
The three systems being studied consist of (1) a
core with the inlet and outlet diametrically oppo-
site each other (straight-through flow), (2) a core
with the inlet and outlet concentric and the fluid
entering through the inner pipe and exiting through
the outer annulus, and (3) a core with the inlet
and outlet concentric and the fluid entering through
the annulus and exiting through the inner pipe.

In initial experiments with the concentric system

and the fluid entering through the inner pipe, a

large toroidal eddy was noted in the region be-
tween the high-velocity, central, downward jet
and the return stream along the core walls, Such
an eddy could engender discrete high-temperature
masses within the main fluid flow and thus give
rise to high-frequency thermal cycling of system
components, The effect of a vortex generator at
the entrance will be studied.

Experimental determinations are being made of
the viscosities and thermal conductivities of
several BeF ,-bearing fluoride salt mixtures. Heat
transfer studies are being made in order to de-
termine the effect of nonwetting and interfacial
film formation on heat transfer in Inconel and
INOR-8 systems. A single circular tube will be
used for these studies with the salt mixture

LiF-BeF ,-UF , (53-46-1 mole %).
1.4. Advanced Reactor Studies

A preliminary design study was mdde of a
natural-convection molten salt reactor which could
be used in a system in which there was a premium
placed on reliability and ease of maintenance.
The advantages of eliminating the fuel-circulating
pumps and the attendant problems of maintenance
are obtained at the cost of the increased fuel
volume required for a system in which the pressure
losses must be very low. A gas-turbine cycle or
one of several steam cycles that operate efficiently
under high-temperature conditions would be used
with this system. In this study both helium and
a molten salt were considered as coolants for the
primary heat exchanger. A comparison of the
natural-convection system with the forced-circula-
tion system indicates that, for a 60-Mw (thermal)

reactor, the natural-convection system requires a
fuel inventory about 42% greater than that of the

forced-circulation system.

An idealized reactor ‘model -is being used in va

systematic study of the influence of various

- factors on the power required to obtain a given -

tained for the idealized model, and further studies

completed and part of the second phase of testing
is under way, Only Inconel thermal-convection
loops have been examined thus far, but the low
corrosion rates expected in these 1000-hr tests
were found.

Studies are under way for determining the effect
of carburization on the mechanical properties of
reactor structural materials, The sodium-grophite
system was found to be a rapid and effective
medium for carburizing stainless steels, Hastelloy
B, ond Inconel. On the other hand, Inconel exposed
to the graphite~fuel 30 (NaF-ZrF -UE,, 50-46-4
mole %) system for 100 hr at 1500 ‘and at 1250°F
in seesaw-furnace apparatus did not become
carburized. Static capsule tests revealed that
INOR-8 carburized more readily in sodium than
Inconel, The INOR-8 tensile specimens to be
used for strength and elongation determinations
are being prepared by using the sodium-graphite
system.

The precious-metal brazing alloys, 82% Au-18%
Ni and 80% Au-20% Cu, being considered for use
in the fabrication of fuel-salt—to~coolant-salt heat
exchangers were corrosion tested in fuel mixtures.
Neither alloy showed attack after 2000 hr at
1200°F in static tests and 500 hr in seesaw-
furndce apparatus, Similarly, no attack was found
on any of the welded INOR-8 plates tested in NaK
and in fuel 130 in seesaw-furnace apparatus for
500 hr at 1200°F. Various nickel-molybdenum-
base welding rods were used,

Measurements were made of the modulus of
elasticity, the thermal conductivity, and the

tensile properties of several commercial air-melted
heats

“of INOR-8. Studies were initiated for _
determining whether INOR-8 has a tendency to
embrittle in the temperature range of 1000 to
1400°F. Specimens are being aged for periods of

500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, and 10,000 hr. Pre-

liminary results show that the specimens ‘aged

500 hr did not become brittle, oo
Tests are under way for obtaining basic data on
Since relatively fong

properties, preliminary data on tensile properties

are being obtained for use in ‘design studies.

Data are’ presented for sheet specimens that must
be considered ‘as approximate. Relaxation tests
being made to determine whether INOR-8 will
deform plastically under reactor operating con-
ditions have indicated that the creep strength
will have to be investigated,

Investigations of the welding characteristics of a similar loop in the ORR and for the irradiation of

INOR-8 tubing were continued, and evaluation fuel 130 in INOR-8 capsules in the MTR,
tests were made of various weld metals. Seven
different heats of INOR-8 from three different
sources have been studied, ond only one has
shown cracking tendencies when welded. In these
investigations, weld test plates are prepared that
provide specimens for mechanical property studies
of welded joints, for radiographic, metallographic,
and hardness studies, and for obtaining general
information on the welding characteristics of the
materials under conditions of high restraint,

2.3. Chemistry

Phase equilibrium studies are being made for
determining whether an LiF-BeF, mixture will
dissolve sufficient ThF, and UF, to provide a
fuel for a fused salt breeder reactor. The studies
have "indicated that the quaternary system LiF-
BeF,-ThF -UF, can be tredted ‘as a ternary
system and that some interpolations can be made

An examination was made of the INOR-8 forced- between the systems LiF-BeF,-UF, and LiF-
circulation loop that failed during initial heating BeF,-ThF with regard to liquidus temperatures
in a test stand.” The failure occurred near the and phase relationships. Breeder reactor blanket

as the dioxides and are the least soluble.

1.1. REACTOR DESIGN

STUDY LAYOUTS OF REACTOR SYSTEM
E. J. Breeding
J. Y. Estabrook ~~ W. S. Harris  R. E. Helms

Preliminary layouts of the molten-sait reactor
(MSR) system are being prepored as a means of
studying the mechanical design. These layouts
are based on the use of five fuel pumps and two

blanket-salt pumps. The total thermal power.

production is assumed to be 638 Mw, with 90% of
the power being generated in the 8-ft-dia core and
10% being generated in the 2-ft-thick blanket,
Each of the layouts, presented here as Figs. 1.1.1
through 1.1.5, has both satisfactory and unsatis-
factory features. It is hoped that through examining
many possible arrangements the most simple de-
sign can be determined. Layouts of the reactor
cell are also being made in order to determine the
best possible arrangements of piping and other
components that will provide minimum plant size
and yet facilitate remote maintenance.

The basic layout shown in Fig. 1.1.1 of a two-
pass reactor with a blanket was conceived with the
support -and fabrication problems as the major
influence. The main support ring is, in effect,
a channel rolled into a ring. Both the blanket and
core shells are supported by this ring. The fuel
pumps are supported by their barrels, which pene-
trate the top flange. Both the fuel and the blanket-
salt expansion tanks. are formed by conventional
shell-head shapes. Individual pump suction lines

direct to the neck of the reactor core vessel are
provided to avoid stresses induced by penetration.

of the blanket shell, The method of support of -
the pumps. permits the pump discharges to be

rotated without altering the details of fabrication

of the vessel. Except for the outrigged blanket-

salt pumps, the unit is symmetrical in “order to

simplify fabrication. All parts of the fuel system
are in packages of five in order to lower the cost
of fabrication, The fuel inventory of a reactor of = ~~:

330 f°, One of the main objections to this layout

is that there is no blanket salt around the neck of sn

the core vessel.

The layout presented in Fig. 1.1.2 has the.

advantage that the core is completely surrounded

with blanket salt, and yet simple shapes have been
retained for ease of fabrication, The fuel pumps
are equally spaced around the periphery of the
reactor, and the two blanket-salt pumps are located
in a central annulus of blanket over the core.
This arrangement permits the support of the pumps
and the blanket pressure shell from a grid type of

frame above the reactor, The fuel pumps are
connected by a gas annulus or torus with space
for expansion of the fuel under conditions other
than normal. The pumps are completely covered
with fuel at all times. The fuel inventory for this
layout is 395 ft2 and could be reduced, since the
connecting pipes out of the core and the pump
tanks appear to be larger than necessary. The
fuel inlet and outlet pipes pass through the
blanket pressure vessel wall and may create
undesirable stresses, The temperature difference
between the inlet and outlet pipes is expected to
be about 135°F. Further study will be required to
determine whether the resulting stresses can be
tolerated,

MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR PROGRAM PROGRESS REPORT

NUCLEAR CALCULATIONS
L. G. Alexander J. T. Roberts

Nuclear calculations relative to parameter studies
of molten salt reactors for the production of power
were continued. The Univac calculations, for
which the Ocusol program is used, have provided
information about U233. and U?33-fueled reactors
of the reference design type, primarily, but studies
have been initiated of plutonium-fueled molten
salt reactors and of graphite-moderated molten salt

-U233 breeder reactors.

Univac-Ocusol Reactor Calculations
J. T. Roberts

The parameter study of two-region, homogeneous,
molten salt reactors described in the previous
report! has been extended and refined. The calcu-
lations based on the use of the 69 mole % LiF-31
mole % BeF, salt plus ThF, and UF in the core
and of the 75 mole % LiF-25 mole % ThF, salt
in the blanket were completed, and a new study
based on the use of a 63 mole % LiF~37 mole %
BeF, salt plus ThF, and UF in the core and of
a 71 mole % LiF-16 mole % BeF,~13 mole % ThF
salt in the blanket was initiated. The effects of
changing the salts are expected to be a small
reduction in critical mass and a reduction of
approximately 12% in the external regeneration
ratio. Blanket thickness will also be a variable
in the new parameter study.

In the calculations just completed a comparison
was made of U2%3- and U?35-fueled reactors. The
results of these calculations are presented in Fig.
1.1.6, which shows the fissionable material in-
ventory at startup as a function of core diameter.
The effect of various amounts of thorium, in the
range 0 fo | mole % in the fuel salt, is also shown.
For the some core diameter and thorium content of
the fuel salt, the U233 inventory for the cases
shown is less than half the U239 inventory, This
is due to both the higher o, and the lower a for
y233 compared with those for U239 in intermediate
reactors. In Figs. 1.1.7 and 1.1.8, the 7-1, the
initial total regeneration ratio, and the initial
blanket regeneration ratio for U235. and U233.
fueled reactors are plotted as functions of thorium
content of the fuel salt for core diameters in the

range 5 to 10 ft. In the U?35 cases the regenera-
tion ratio is limited to a maximum of about 0.675
by the comparatively low value of 5 and a practical
minimum loss to capture in the salt and in the core
shell of about 0.1+. The U?33 cases were not
carried far enough to establish a *‘ceiling’’ on the
regeneration ratio, but, judging from the n—1values,
it would seem to be possible to exceed 1.0 by
increasing the thorium content of the fuel salt to,
perhaps, 1.5 to 2% and, at the same time, in-
creasing the y233 inventory to, perhaps, 300 to
900 kg, depending on the core diameter. It should
be remembered, however, that the regeneration
ratios shown for the U?33.fueled reactors will
decrease with time as burnup poisons accumulate
in the system, while in the U%35.fyeled reactors,
with initial regeneration ratios of about 0.6 or
better, the regeneration ratio may actually improve
with time and with reasonable chemical-processing
rates because of the buildup of the superior U233
fuel. :

Calculations were also made in order to compare
lithium-beryllium and sodium-beryllium salts as
fuels for reactors of the reference design type.

the scattering ond leakage probabilities are in-
sensitive functions of the varying concentrations.
The program was operated with constants that
characterized the spectrum, leakage, and scattering
in Ocusol Case 89-2, for which the data were pre-
sented previously.® The code operated satis-
factorily but disclosed the hitherto unrecognized
fact that the spectrum and leakage output from
Ocusol are not consistent with the scattering
properties, The source of the inconsistency is
not known, but may be due to a biased round-off of
the leakages at the highest energies, which, being
small, are known to only two significant figures.
Since the spectrum in Sorghum is computed in a
stepwise manner, beginning with the high-energy
groups, the round-off bias tends to accumulate
and to be amplified in the lower groups.

In order to remedy this defect, a subroutine for
computing the constants for Sorghum from the con-
centrations, absorption cross sections, initial
spectrum, and leakage probabilities was written
and incorporated in the program. The resulting
constants, which differ only slightly from those
based on the scattering cross sections computed
by Ocusol, reproduce the initial spectrum and
critical concentration exactly.

Absorption “cross sections for Pa233, U234,

y23s, Np2¥7, and Pu23? were estimated and were
inserted into the program, together with fission
cross sections for Pu?3%, The modi fied program
has been operated successfully on a test case.
Tests to determine limitations imposed on the
magnitude of the time increment by convergence
requirements and the drift in group leakage proba-

bilities are in progress.

Efforts to bring the Oracle program Cornpone
into use for molten salt reactors have been con-
tinued. Initial tests, for which the Ocusol group
structure and cross sections were used, showed
disagreement in the critical mass; also, the com-

ing the group structure, scaling factors, number of
space points in thin-shell regions, and method of
treating the principal scatterers are being studied.

FUEL FILL-AND-DRAIN SYSTEM DESIGN
G. D. Whitman

A preliminary design study has been made of a
fuel fill-and-drain system for the MSR. This
system must meet the following three major design
criteria:

1. A preheating system must be provided that is
capable of maintaining the drain vessel! and its
connecting plumbing at 1200°F,

2. A reliable heat-removal system must be pro-
vided that has sufficient capacity fo handle ‘the
fuel afterheat.

3. The drain vessel must be ‘‘ever-safe’’ so thot
criticality cannot be achieved when the fuel is
drained,

The fuel draining operation has not been con-
sidered as an emergency procedure which must be
accomplished in a relatively short period of time
in order to prevent a catastrophe, It is considered
that, if all forced circulation ceased during high-
power operation, the thermal capacity and heat
losses of the system would prevent prompt thermal
transients that would be capable of causing
failure of the primary containment vessels. There
are, however, other incentives for rapid removal of
the fluid from the fuel circuit. [f, for example,
there was a leak in the fuel system it would be
important to drain the fuel in order to minimize the
cell contamination and cross contamination of
systems. Further, rapid removal of the fuel at the
time of a shutdown for maintenance would have an
economic advantage in reducing the power outage
time,

"A consideration of these factors indicated that

for ‘one year and had been shut down for 10 min

before. the fuel was drained. No credit was taken
wo for fission-gas removal during operation. It was
_ determined that 15 min ‘would be required to remove
- the fuel from the reactor. :
and three | promising codes were selected for further ~~
study. These are: the *‘CURE,"’ a generalized, --
two-dimensional,’ : ‘multigroup program “suitable for
- investigating the effect of the north head of the =~
‘reactor on the Jesctivity ‘and breeding ratio; “the -
“multigroup, multiregion, “one-
dimensional program “similar to Eyewash-Ocusol;

“For the drain vessel ‘design calculations, it was

 

“assumed ‘that at 1200°F the fuel system volume
“would be 600 #3, “The design’ capacity of the
“drain”. “vessel was therefore set at 750 #2 in order
to ‘allow for temperature excursions and a residual
‘heel. ‘An array of 12-in.-dia pipes was selected as
“the primary containment vessel of the drain system

in order to obtain a large surface-area-to-volume
ratio for heat transfer efficiency and to provide a

MOLTEN.SALT REACTOR PROGRAM PROGRESS REPORT

large amount of nuclear poison material, Forty-
eight 20-ft lengths of 12-in.-dia pipe would be
arranged in six vertical banks connected on
opposite ends with mitered joints. The six banks
of pipe would be connected at the bottom with a

common . drain line that would connect with the.

fuel system, The drain system would be preheated
and * maintained at the desired temperature with
electric heaters installed in small-diameter pipes
located axially inside the 12-in.-dia pipes. These
bayonet-type heaters could all be removed or in-
stalled from one face of the pipe array to facilitate
maintenance. The entire system would be installed
in on insulated room or furnace to minimize heat
losses.

The removal of the fuel afterheat would be
accomplished by filling boiler tubes installed be-
tween the 12-in.-dia fuel-containing pipes with
cold water from a header that would normally be
full. The boiler tubes would normally be dry and
at the ambient temperature of about 1200°F,
Cooling would be accomplished by radiant heat
transfer from the fuel-containing pipes to the low-
pressure, low-temperature water in the boiler tubes.
For the peak afterheat load, about 150 gpm of
water would be required to supply the boiler tubes,

This fill-and-drain system design satisfies the
design criteria in that it is always in a standby
condition in which it is immediately available for
drainage of the fuel, it can adequately handle the
fuel afterheat, and it provides double containment
of the fuel. The heat-removal scheme is essen-
tially self-regulating in that the amount of heat
removal is determined by the rate of heat transfer.
Both the water and the fuel systems are at low
pressure, and a double failure would be required

“for the two fluids to be mixed. The drain system

tank could be enclosed and sealed from the atmos-
phere because there are no large gas-cooling ducts
or other major external systems connected to it.
A stainless steel tray would be placed below
each bank of pipes to catch the fuel if a leak

. developed. These trays would be cooled by water

walls to prevent any possibility of meltdown and
destruction of the cell,

DESIGN OF A HYDROSTATIC BEARING FOR A
MOLTEN SALT PUMP IMPELLER
B. W. Kinyon

A hydrostatic bearing was investigated for use
as a pilot bearing for a molten salt pump because

16

the pressure of the pumped fluid could be used to
maintain the centering of the impeller in the pump
casing. Two designs are possible: one in which
the pockets are located around the .inside of the
bearing and one in which. the pockets are on the
impeller. The latter design offers the advontage
that the supply passages for fluid flow to the
pockets are in the impeller and are thus replace-
able. : a

The chief difference between the conventional
hydrostatic bearing with stationary pockets and
the bearing in which the pockets rotate on the
impeller is that in the latter case the fluid flow
through a given pocket is variable except when
the impeller is centered, which only occurs under

the improbable situation that there is no side-load

on the shaft. The variation in flow velocity, v, of
the fluid leaving the pockets of the two designs is
shown in Fig. 1.1.11,

The pressure in the pocket acting between the
shaft and the journal is proportional to v2 if the
pockets are stationary, but the proportionality must
be adjusted by an acceleration factor if the pockets
are rotating. The curves of Fig. 1.1.11 indicate
that the load-supporting ability of the two designs

displacement between the curves. -

Preliminary calculations for a 16-in.<dia impeller
running ot 1175 rpm and having 12 pockets around
the periphery have been made. The radial clearance
was taken as 0.015 in. The load capacity per inch
of pocket height is shown in Fig. 1.1.12 as a func-
tion of impeller displacement. ‘Circumferential

flow between pockets was neglected in these pre--

liminary calculations. A calculation at one point
indicated - that the circumferential flow would re-
duce the load capacity about 15% for a bearing
1.5 in. high. If the bearing height were increased,
the relative circumferential flow would increase,
and the load capacity of the bearing per inch of

height would decrease, even though the total load

capacity of the bearing would increase. For this
bearing, a flow of 0.137 #3/sec was required with
a power consumption of 1.38 hp (net). These
valves are 1.25 ond 0.82%, respectively, of the
flow and power consumption of the pump.

An investigation of the effect of varying the

‘pressure and flow indicated that, for the same

power’ consumption, high flow at low pressure
would give more load capacity in the bearing than

would low flow at high pressure. The pressure

enlarging the orifice would result in a larger load
capacity of the bearing without increasing the
power required for providing the flow for the
bearing.

FUEL PUMP DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
W. F. Boudreau A. G. Grindell

Pump Design Studies
W. G. Cobb M. E. Lackey

The optimum design of a fuel pump for a
circulating-fuel reactor is, of course, dependent on
the general configuration of the reactor and its
major components. In turn, the design of the
reactor can be substantially influenced by the
pump characteristics. This. mutual interdependence
dictates that pump design must be continuously
coordinated with the general reactor design.

One of the major considerations in the design
of a centrifugal pump is the problem of cavitation,
The onset of cavitation is primarily governed by
the net total pressure available at the impeller
inlet to lift the salt into the impeller. Cavitation
must be avoided, since it can cause physical
damage to the impeller or to other parts of the
pump. - Cavitation data obtained for fused salt
pumps at ORNL have been studied in relation to
pressures, flow rates, and pressure drops in the
heat exchangers and in other portions of the primary
fuel circuit of the reference-design reactor. These
preliminary studies indicate that five pumps with
the following design parameters will be suitable
for circulating fuel 130 (BeF,-LiF-UF, 37-62-1
mole %):

Flow through pump 4950 gpm
Head produced by pump 71 ft
Temperature at pump inlet 1230°F ‘{max)
“Static pressure ot pump inlet 19.2 psia
Pump shaft speed 1160 rpm

wv. B. McDonald

A pump design is being prepared that is based on
these design values, but it is realized that further
studies of the reactor design may require changes.
It will not be difficult to translate the results of
these studies to pumps of other capacities.

The basic design of an impeller ‘and a double
volute for the pump was developed that is serving
as the basis for a series of pump layouts. Various
types and arrangements of bearings (salt-lubricated,
oil-lubricated, and gas-lubricated) and seals are
being considered in conjunction with at least two
different motor arrangements (totally enclosed and
conventional). These layouts will permit a de-

termination of the most favorable arrangement of -

all elements from the standpoints of adaptability to

‘reactor construction, durability, adaptability fo

remote maintenance operations, reactor operational
problems, and so on.

A number of commercial organizations have built
pumps for use with liquid metals under service
conditions which approach those of the molten
salt reactor. In order to utilize their experience,
study contracts are to be negotioted with several
manufacturers. These companies will be asked
to study the fuel pump application in the light of
their own experience and to formulate conceptual
designs that incorporate their recommendations.
Preliminary discussions have been held with
representatives of Allis<Chalmers Mfg. Co,
Westinghouse Electric Corp., and Byron Jackson Co.

Development Tests of Salt-Lubricated Bearings
P. G. Smith L. V. Wilson

The fused salt pumps now in use for development
tests have conventional oil-lubricated bearings.
These elements impose restrictions on the design
and construction of the pump, since the bearings

¥)

)

must be shielded from both the heat and the
radiation from the fuel salt in order to avoid damage
to the bearings and to the lubricant.’ The availa-
bility of a satisfactory bearing lubricated by the
fuel salt would eliminate these restrictions and
should permit improvements in pump construction
from the standpoints of reliability and simpli-
fication.

A survey of existing knowledge concerning

materials suitable for use in the construction of

salt-lubricated ~ bearings was made, and it was
found that at least two combinations of materials
showed considerable promise: (1) molybdenum
running against tungsten carbide containing
12.5 wt % cobalt and (2) tungsten carbide cons
taining 12.5 wt % cobalt running against itself.
The coefficients of thermal expansion of these
materials differ from those of INOR-8 and Inconel,
however, and therefore there may be design and
development problems involved in the use of these
materials.

Two high-temperature bearing test units are to
be set up. One unit will provide facilities for
testing hydrodynamic (plain journal) bearings, and
the other will provide for the testing of hydrostatic
(fluid piston) bearings. Existing high-temperature
equipment will be modified for use in this test
program.

The design of the hydrodynamic-bearing test
unit has been completed, and procurement and
fabrication of parts have been initiated. = This
test unit will utilize a modified sump pump

designed for circulating NoK at high temperatures.
The impeller has been removed, and the shaft has -

been modified to accommodate the rotating portion

“of the test bearing at its lower end. ‘The stationary

element of the bearing is held by a movable ‘arm

= brought ‘out of ‘the pump tank through a bellows
seal. Variable loads can be applied to the bearing
‘by ‘on air cylinder attached to the outer end of
“the movable arm. A calibrated drive motor is used
“in order to obtain data on ‘load vs test-unit torque.
~The test: information that will be obtained iis
~~ expected to permit a good analysis of the behavior
“of the fused salts of interest as bearing lubricants.
“The theory of the hydrodynamic bearing has been
~~ well worked out ‘in recent ‘years, and its relative
"mechanical simplicity tends to facilitate analysis. -
“The initial studies of the pump design problem:

have ‘indicated, however, that the hydrostatic
(fluid-piston) type of bearing may have a number of
advantages for use in fused salt pumps. Among

PERIOD ENDING JANUARY 31, 1958

the most important is that such bearings can
withstand a considerable amount of mechanical
damage without appreciable impairment of their
load-carrying capacity. Therefore the second
bearing ‘test unit will incorporate a hydrostatic
bearing. Layout studies indicate that a satisfactory
test unit can be constructed by removing the lower
(oil-lubricated) bearing and seal of another pump
of the type described above and incorporating a
hydrostatic bearing on the shaft immediately above
the impeller. The impeller will be used as the
source of pressure and load for the bearing.

The novel form of hydrostatic bearing described in
Chap. 1.1, which eliminates complexities associated
with many conventional hydrostatic bearings, will
also be tested. A model that will use water as the
lubricant is to be constructed.

~The combined geometries of the reactor and the
pumps will, of course, determine eventually the
location of the pump bearings. Since salt-lubricated
bearings could be placed at several locations in
the pump, studies of a variety of configurations of
salt-lubricated bearings are being made in terms
of the basic variables, such as diameter, clearance
ratio, and length-to-diameter ratio.

Development Tests of Mechanical Shaft Seals

Development tests of sump pumps with oil

‘lubricated shaft seals that were designed for

circulating high-temperature NaoK have revealed
that NaK vapor may diffuse into the seal oil-
leakage area and react with the oil to form sludges

“that interfere with the functioning of the seal.
Since oil-lubricated shaft seals would be of use in -
- molten “salt reactor applications, . means for
‘preventing diffusion of process-fluid vapor into

the seal region are being sought.

The - flow path of the helium in the seal orec

(which normally serves to purge the oil leaking
“from the seal) was ‘changed so that part of the
“helium would flow upward into the seal area ond
~~ the remainder would flow downward along the shaft.
to reduce diffusion of the NaK vapor into the seal -
“region. A pump ‘incorporating this modified seal

has ‘now operated for approximately 2600 hr at a

~NaK temperature -of '1200°F and a pump speed

of 2400 rpm. Seal leakage has been negligible,
and no evidences of seal damage have been noted.
The test is continuing.

MOLTEN.SALT REACTOR PROGRAM PROGRESS REPORT

Development Tests of OilsLubricated Bearings
P. G. Smith W. E. Thomas

The lower bearings for the fuel pumps may

possibly be salt-lubricated, as described above,
but oil-lubricated bearings may be required at the
upper end of the shaft. The oil in these bearings
could, of course, be damaged by radiation from the
salt fuel. It has been found that the lubricant
Dowtherm A, a eutectic mixture of diphenyl and
diphenyl oxide, offers the advantage that it
decomposes into gaseous and liquid products when
irradiated rather than into carbonaceous deposits
of the type that result from the irradiation of
hydrocarbon-base lubricants. = The principal dis-
advantage of Dowtherm as a lubricant is that it
lacks ‘the property of oiliness, that is, the ability
to provide very thin films for lubrication. -

An experimental evaluation of the behavior of
Dowtherm A is being conducted in a special high-
temperature sump pump that includes centrifuges
for degassing. The pump is circulating fuel 30
(NaF-Z¢F ,-UF ,, 50-46-4 mole %) at a temperature
of 1200°F; the shaft speed is about 3000 rpm; and
the temperature of the lubricant returning from the
bearing is maintained af 180°F.

The initial test was terminated by failure of the
drive motor after 172 hr of operation. Future tests
will be on a long-term basis, except that the pump
will be dismantled in order to inspect it for signs
of wear at intervals of 1000 hr. Aside from the
swelling of some O-rings made of buna N elastomer,
no adverse effects attributable to the use of
Dowtherm A as a lubricant have been noted.

Irradiation and Endurance Tests of
Bearings and Seals

S. M. DeCamp W. E. Thomas

Bearings exposed to radiation fields could be
lubricated with hydrocarbons if it were possible to
limit the dose received by any part of the lubricant
to a maximum value of about 10% r. In theory,
this could be occomplished by changing the
lubricant frequently enough to avoid an excessive
total dose. In practice, it would be difficult to be
certain that all the lubricant was removed from the
area of greatest exposure in a sufficiently uniform
manner. Irradiation tests have demonstrated that
any portion of a hydrocarbon lubricant that receives

an excessive dose of radiation will form solid -
residues and (for some types of lubricant) acidic

20

products. Such reaction products could be expected
to interfere with the removal of the balance of the
lubricant from the irradiated area.

A test unit for investigating this problem i in a
practical situation has been set up in the canal at
the MTR. Spent fuel elements are placed around
the seal and bearing area of a test unit composed
of a bearing housing, a (lower) sleeve bearing, an
(upper) double-row ball bearing, upper and lower
shaft seals, and a shaft.- The lower seal and
bearing area will be exposed to a total dose of
1.3 x 1010 rep of gamma radiation. Test: operation
of this unit will be started soon:

"A life test of a bellows-mounted seal (all metal,

“except for the carbon nose piece) is being

conducted in a sump pump that is circulating

“ NaK at 1250°F; the pump shaft speed is 2400 rpm.

Although the leakage of the seal was high when
it was first installed, iit has been negligible during

‘the last 400 hr of an accumulated total of 2500 hr

of operation.

DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNIQUES FOR REMOTE
MAINTENANCE OF THE REACTOR SYSTEM

E. Storto

The ability to perform maintenance work on the
primary and secondary systems of the reactor
within the containment cell is of primary importance
to the successful operation of a central-station
nuclear power plant. Consideration of the problems

‘involved indicates that the most feasible solution
to this maintenance problem is to make all com-

ponents removable and replaceable by remote
manipulation and to arrange and interconnect the
components so that the number of replaceable units
is minimized. Actual repair work on or disposal
of components that had failed would then be

carried out in separate hot-cell facilities set up

for this purpose. The problems associated with:
this maintenance concept have been studied, and
solutions now being worked out are described in
the following sections. :

Mechanical Joint Development
- AJ S. Olson

In order for all components of the reactor to be
removable ond replaceable by remote manipulation,
it is necessary to provide a means for remotely
separating and ‘joining the pipes which connect
the major components of the system. Welded joints
provide a system of the highest ‘integrity, of
course, and methods for remote welding and

inspection are being developed at other instal-
lations. The difficulties are formidable, however,
and satisfactory equipment and techniques cannot

“be expected in the near future. Attention is

therefore being given to the development of a
reliable mechanical joint.

The freeze-flange type of joint shown in
Fig. 1.2.1 is being tested in the Inconel loop
illustrated schematically in Fig. 1.2.2. In this
type of joint, a frozen seal of molten salt is used
to prevent leakage of the salt from the loop through
the space between the flanges. An additional
seal of soft iron or copper rings is provided to
minimize gas leakage during shutdowns of the loop.

Heat transfer from the molten salt in the tubing
to the outer edge of the flange is reduced by
providing a narrow section in the flange. In
addition, there is a channel for air cooling in each
flange. The test flanges are made of Inconel and
are held together with eight quick-opening toggle
clomps, as shown in Fig. 1.2.3.

3 x 10? ecm3/sec, and the rate for another was
2.4 x 10-8 cm3/sec.

A flange joint which has ¢ cast-metal seal
between the two halves has also been designed,
and tests are to be made with two sealing ma-

‘terials: silver and an alloy of 72% silver and 28%

copper (see Chap. 2.1 for details of selection of
sealing materials). A seal will be formed by
fusion of the sealing material before the loop is
charged with salt. The seal ‘material will be in
the solid state during operation. Joints of this
type are being incorporated into the test loop, as
shown in Fig. 1.2.2. A diagram of the cast-metal-
seal flange joint is shown in Fig. 1.2.7.

A flange joint with a soft-annealed copper ring
for sealing the two flanges has also been designed.

HEAT EXCHANGER DEVELOPMENT

J. C. Amos R. E. MacPherson
R. L. Senn

Heat transfer correlations for use in predicting
heat exchanger performance are required for the
development of a realistic heat exchanger design.
While standard heat transfer correlations have been
found to be. satisfactory for predicting the heat
transfer performance of some molten salts, the
performance of some. other salts has been found to
deviate from'these correlations for various reasons.
For example; the heat transfer characteristics of
some salts appear to be critically affected by the
type of material selected for heat exchanger
construction. = Also, differences in heat transfer
performance of some salt mixtures have been
attributed to a difference in wetting properties of
the salts. It is, therefore, essential that heat
transfer correlations for the specific salt mixtures
under consideration for use in the molten salt
reactor be determined experimentally so that
proposed heat exchanger designs can be adequately
evaluated,

Heat transfer coefficients will be determined
in laboratory-scale single-tube test - apparatus
(see Chap. 1.3 of this report), and it has al-
ready been possible to obtain pertinent fused
salt heat transfer data from a relatively large-scale

heat exchanger test facility that was available.
A schematic flow diagram of ‘the. test facility is
"shown in Fig. 1.2.11. _ All components of this

system are Inconel, and heat is supplied to the

“fused salt by direct resistance heating of the
“Inconel tubing. ~ The heat ‘is transferred from =
the salt flowing in the tubes to NaK flowing in -

_ the shell side of a 25-tube heat exchanger of the
“type shown in “Fig. 1.2.12, ond heat is removed

from the NaK by a 500-kw NaK-to-air heat dump.

Salt and NaK flow rates are measured by venturis
‘equipped with Moore. Nullmatic pressure-measuring
devices. The NaK flow rate is also measured with

an electromagnetic flowmeter. All temperatures

are measured with Chromel-Alumel thermocouples.

The NaK loop is equipped with a circulating cold

PERIOD ENDING JANUARY 31, 1958

trap for control of the oxide content. This test
facility, which is designated Small Heat Exchanger
Test Stapd-.C (SHE-C), is shown in Figs. 1.2.13
and 1.2.14. “Heat transfer data are presently being
obtained for fuel 130. Other fuel salts will” be
tested ‘as required.

The system was calibrated by making a test run
with “fuel 30 (NaF-ZrF ,-UF ,, 50-46-4 mole %),
for which heat transfer data were available. Data
were obtained over a fused salt Reynolds number
range of 425 to 6150 at temperatures ranging from
1100 to 1300°F. The heat balances obtained were
in good agreement throughout; there was, normally,
agreement to within 2%.

Preliminary analyses of data obtained for
fuel 130 are being made. Since the physical
property data currently being used for this salt
were extrapolated from data on other salts, com-
plete correlation of these data with results for
other fluids cannot be made until physical property
data for fuel 130 are determined experimentally.
Approximate heat transfer coefficients can,
however, be obtained with the current information.
A block diagram showing operating conditions for
a typical heat transfer run is presented in
Fig. 1.2.15.

The difficulty of accurately predicting liquid
metal heat transfer performance in heat exchanger
shells may make desirable the further refinement

- of the fused salt data by substituting a fused salt

of known heat transfer properties for the NaK now
being circulated in the secondary loop. Such a
substitution, if made, would require further
modifications of the test facilities.

planned tests requires at least 15 test facilities,
nine of which were available at the start of the
quarter and two of which became available during
the period. The remaining loops are being
constructed.

The operating experience thus far has shown
the need for improvements in test stand reliability,

The availability of good quality INOR-8 is
improving, “and two special INOR-8 loops have
been constructed. One of these includes graphite
specimens and the other includes special INOR-8
specimens for weight loss studies.

In the weight loss studies an effort will be made
to determine accurately the corrosion rate of
INOR-8 at a wall temperature of 1300°F, when
exposed to a fused salt, by carefully measuring
and weighing the inserts. Provisions will be
made to assure that the specimens are not exposed
to the atmosphere before and after exposure. Three
somples will be exposed, each for a different time,
in an effort to establish a corrosion rate which
may be extrapolated to operating periods of several
years.

The loop for the weight loss studies was
designed, as shown in Fig. 1.2.16, to incorporate
the three samples at the hot end of the heater
section with a separate power source to control
the wall temperatures. The samples were machined
to fit inside a sleeve. The samples and the sleeve

_ were fused together aot the ends when welded into

the loop piping so that current would pass through
the samples.

The loop which contains graphite specimens will
be examined after operation to determine the
extent to which graphite causes carburization of
INOR-8 and the effects of the fused salt on
graphite. Specimens of impervious graphite
especially prepared by the National Carbon

~ Company are being used. The graphite-specimen

assembly is shown in Fig. 1.2.17. The graphite
container was designed to give a graphite-to-
INOR-8 surface area ratio of 0.67. It has been
installed at the ‘outlet of the heater section of a
standard forced-circulation - “loop fabricated of

%einodia, 0.035-in.-wall INOR-8 tubing. , The
graphite rods are 11 in. long; 32 of them are Y in.
"in diameter and 24 are. %e in. in diameter.” At
_ both “ends “of the container, retainer and baffle
plates” hold’ the rods in place and distribute the

other. by wire spacers “wound around them at 3-in.-
intervals. The rods ‘were carefully weighed after
” the” ‘spacers ‘were installed, and their positions

were noted before the box - was sealed.
The bifluid loop that was ‘placed in operation in

‘March 1957 had accumulated a total of 6673 hr of

‘operation at the specified temperatures and flow

rates when operation of the loop was terminated

gives operating data. A maximum pump speed of

3000 rpm has been established on the basis of test

experience in order to ensure long life. At this

HYDRODYNAMIC STUDIES OF MSR CORE
F. E. Lynch

The molten salt reactor as presently designed
has a spherical core. Three entrance-exit systems
have been proposed for this core, namely, inlet
and outlet diametrically opposite each other with
straight-through flow, inlet and outlet concentric
with the fluid entering through the inner pipe and
exiting through the outer annulus, and inlet and
outlet concentric with the fluid entering through
the annulus and exiting through the inner pipe.
With each of these entrance-exit systems, stagna-
tion and flow separation are possible in the
spherical core region and could cause excess
heating of the core walls and thermal cycling of
reactor components. Co )

Glass models of each of the three core configura-
tions have been fabricated from large (13.7-in.-ID)
Pyrex reaction vessels. Two of the models are

shown in Figs. 1.3.1 and 1.3.2. The straight-

through core has 6-in.-dia entrance and exit pipes.
The concentric system has a 4-in.-dia central pipe
within a 6-in.-dia 90-deg elbow. In the model for
annular flow studies, the central tube is flared
outward at the bottom to direct the flow along the
spherical surface.

Initial qualitative data have been obtained for
the concentric system with fluid entering through
the central pipe by using the phosphorescent-
particle flow-visualization technique. Both visual
observation of particle motion within a continuously

instantaneous velocity profiles were employed in
obtaining the data. Figure 1.3.3 shows the results

80,000 (2.58 fps in the 4-in. pipe). The inlet jet
was of sufficient strength to retain its shape (a
4-in.-dia cylinder) to the bottom of the vessel. At
this point the fluid turned and moved upward in
a be to Y-in.-wide annular region immediately

adjacent to’ the core wall. The volume between
these two flow regions was filled with a large
toroidal ‘eddy, with its axis of rotation lying near
the main upward flow. Because of unsteadiness
in the flow-generating system, the flow patterns
fluctuated. - The main effect of these pulsations
was in the structure and size of the large eddy.
During periods of pulsation, the central core of
the eddy broke up into two smaller eddies sur-
rounded by the larger rotating mass. It can be

36

“seen that the eddy removes fluid from the exiting

stream and recirculates this liquid through the
high heat generation regions of the core. If good
mixing occurs, there could result a uniform increase
of the exit temperature that corresponded to a
longer fluid residence time in the core. However,
there exists a strong possibility that the outgoing
stream will contain discrete fluid bodies that will
be at temperatures considerably higher than the
mixed-mean temperature. Under these conditions,

high-frequency thermal cycling of system com-
ponents could occur.

Several typical instantaneous- profile photographs
of the flow in the concentric system are shown. in
Fig. 1.3.4. Since grid photographs are not avail-
able, quantitative velocity analyses of the data
cannot be made. In all cases the time lapse be-
tween the initial excitation and the recording of
the profile was approximately 0.1 sec. In Fig.
1.3.44 the velocity profile at the exit of the inlet
pipe is shown. The straight light line above the
profile indicates the initial excitation, or zero-time
line. The zero-time line is either directly marked
or indicated by a small triangle near the outer
sphere wall on all the photographs. The profile in
the outer annulus is also visible in Fig. 1.3.44.
Figure 1.3.40 shows the profile at a position just
above the equator of the sphere, and both the
downward central flow and the upward flow along
the wall may be seen. The effect of flow pulsation
may be seen clearly in Figs. 1.3.4c and 1.3.44 for
excitations at the same position but at different
times. Figure 1.3.4e shows a profile obtained at
a 45-deg angle near the sphere bottom. This
photograph indicates a very rapid drop-off in
velocity in moving radially away from the surface
and defines clearly the extent of the low velocity
region (high light-intensity region).

Studies will ‘be continued with this model, as
well as with the straight-through and the annular
entrance systems. The effects on the velocity
pattern of inducing vortex motion by a generator
located at the entrance will also be determined.

The thermal conductivities of several Bef ,-

with the use of a variable-gap device. In this
apparatus the molten salt is contained in the gap
between two parallel plates, the upper plate being
movable. A series of measurements are made for
various salt thicknesses. This technique permits
the separation of interfacial and metal thermal
resistances so that the thermal conductivity of the

MOLTEN SALT HEAT TRANSFER STUDIES
H. W. Hoffman

Heat transfer studies of molten salts':2 have
indicated that the general correlations for heat
transfer of ordinary fluids (0.5 < Np. < 100) also
apply to the salts. However, these investigations
have also shown that for some metal-salt combina-

"tions marked reductions in system heat transfer

occur because of interfacial film formation and
nonwetting. Therefore, data .on these phenomena
are needed for the design of critical heat transfer
components. :

The apparent heat fransfer coefficient experi-
mentally determined for flow through a single
circular tube has been found to be a sensitive

“indication of the presence of nonwetting or inter-
~ facial film formation in molten salt systems. The

experimental apparatus developed for such heat
transfer coefficient determinations is shown in.

is shown in Fig. 1.3.6. It is proposed to use this
‘apparatus fo study the salt mixture LiF- -BeF,-UF

fluid flow rate is determined by observing the
deflection of the steel beam that supports one of
the tanks as the fluid flows into or out of the tank.

Test section inlet and outlet mixed-mean tempera-

1.4. ADVANCED REACTOR STUDIES

A MOLTEN SALT NATURAL-CONVECTION
REACTOR

F. E. Romie B. W. Kinyon

One of the problems of a circulating-liquid-fuel
reactor is the provision of reliable long-lived fuel-
circulation pumps. This problem would be elimi-
nated if the liquid fuel circulated by natural
convection through the reactor core, through vertical
convection risers, and through the primary heat
exchangers. A molten salt fuel is well suited to
such a reactor because high temperatures could be
attained without pressurization,” and therefore a
gas-turbine cycle or one of several steam cycles
that operate efficiently under high-temperature
conditions could be utilized. The temperatures
would not be so high as to be inconsistent with
the desired long corrosion life. The advantages
of eliminating the fuel-circulation pump and the
attendant problems of maintenance and replacement
are obtained at the cost of the increased fuel
volume required for a system in which the pressure
losses must be very low. There are, however,
applications for a reactor system in which the
premium placed on reliability and ease of mainte-
nance could make the natural-convection system
attractive. The results of a preliminary design
study of such a system are described briefly here,
and a detailed report is being published.’

A schematic diagram. of the 60-Mw (thermal)
molten salt natural-convection reactor system that
was analyzed is shown:in Fig. 1.4.1. The temper-

‘ature of the -fuel salt entering the exchanger ‘was

to sodium to steam. A similar system has been
described elsewhere.? For a 60-Mw thermal output,
"the 850-psia, 900°F steam would give a generator
output of about 22 Mw, with a thermal efficiency
of 37%.

Two sets of terminal temperatures were specified
for the helium coolant. The first set, 850 to
1025°F, ‘was selected for generation of 850-psia,
900°F steam in a system in which helium would
be the only intermediate medium befween the fuel
salt and steam. The second set of helium terminal
temperatures, 676 to 1100°F, was selected for a
helium gas-turbine cycle with an estimoted output
of roughly 18 Mw.

For a specified flow rate of the fuel salt, temper-
ature change of the fuel salt, and pressure drop
across the exchanger, there is one combination of
riser diameter and height of exchanger above the
core for which the salt contained in the risers is a
minimum. These optimum combinations were used
in heat exchanger calculations carried out for
exchanger heights above the reactor of 5, 10, and

20 ft.

Salt-Cooled Heat Exchangers

Design values for the salt-cooled heat exchanger
are summarized in Table 1.4.1. The designs are
based on 0.634-in.-ID, 0.059-in.-wall tubes. Smaller-
diameter tubes would give a lower total fuel-salt
volume, but the number of tubes required would be

larger. For example, 0.42-in.-ID tubes in an. ex-

changer 10 ft above the reactor would involve a

total external fuel-salt volume of 123 #3, but it
would require 7200 tubes.

The design values presented in Table 1.4.1 are
based on a fuel-salt temperature change of 225°.

Varying the temperature change from 200 to 250°F

does not change the total fuel-salt volume appreci-
ably.

exchanger in which the helium terminal temperature
would be suitable for the generation of 900°F
steam are presented in Table 1.4.2. It was assumed

that copper fins would be used on the helium-cooled
heat exchanger tubes. The use of lower-conduc-
tivity fins would lead to a considerably increased
fuel inventory. The dimensions given for the heat
exchanger are those for a three-helium-pass cross-
flow exchanger. - Doubling the helium pressure
level to 200 psia while maintaining a pumping
expenditure of 2% of generator output would not
change the total salt volume appreciably but would
give a more compact heat exchanger. A similar
result would be obtained if at 100 psia the pumping
expenditure were doubled.

A cross section of a possible helium-cooled heat
exchanger configuration is shown in Fig. 1.4.2.
The configuration shown permits attachment of the
riser pipes to the salt headers, with sufficient
flexibility to minimize thermal stresses, and pro-
vides a cylindrical container for the pressurized
helium. Use of two such cylinders to contain the
reference-design heat exchanger would give two

heat exchangers, each 19.5 ft long. If the helium
pressure were increased to 200 psia, the length
of each heat exchanger would be reduced to 12 ft.

Helium-Cooled Heat Exchanger for
Gas-Turbine Cycle

The temperature of the helium returned to the
heat exchanger from the gas-turbine-system regen-
erator is estimated to be 676°F, which is 174°F
below the fusion temperature of the fuel salt.
Therefore a counterflow heat exchanger with
longitudinally finned tubes was selected for the
gas-turbine cycle.’ The temperature of the interface
between the fuel salt and the tube wall can be
maintained at, or above, any desired value by
adjustment of the gas-side thermal resistance per
unit tube length. The design values given in
Table 1.4.3 are based on a minimum interface
temperature of 900°F. For a longitudinally finned

tube the required gas-side thermal resistance
variation along the tube length can be obtained by
an axial variation of the fin height. No data were
available on the heat transfer and flow friction
characteristics of longitudinally finned tubes in a

‘tubé bundle, and the exchanger designs are thus

not complete. However, the number of tubes,
length per tube, and fuel-salt holdup volume can
be estimated with good accuracy if it is assumed,
as seems likely, that the same gas-side thermal
resistance is realizable with uncut longitudinally
fined tubes as with circumferentially finned tubes.

Comparison of the Yarious Cooling Systems

The fuel-salt holdup volume differs less than
10% for the three cooling systems considered and
is therefore not a determining factor in the selection
of the coolant medium for the reactor. In general,
the helium-cooled heat exchangers have much
larger over-all dimensions than the salt-cooled
heat exchangers. The increased bulk is caused
by the larger spacing required by the finned tubes
and also by the large volume required by the
helium headers. An increase in helium pressure
would decrease the helium header volume and also
should decrease the fuel-salt header volume. An
upper limit on the helium pressure would probably
be set by consideration of the effects of a tube
rupture in the fuel-salt system. It is of interest
to note that, in other studies of gas cooling in
which such considerations were apparently not
limiting, gas pressures as high as 1000 psia have
been recommended.

Comparison of Natural-Convection System with
Forced-Convection System

The design of a forced-convection reactor sys-
tem? led fo an estimate of 0.56 f° of fuel salt

44

external to a molten. salt reactor per thermal
‘megawatt. For the free-convection system using
a 160-3 external salt volume: in the generation
of 60 Mw, the corresponding specific volume is
2.67 #3/Mw. Calculations based on these numbers
and initial, clean, critical-mass data for an un-
reflected molten salt reactor indicate that the fuel
inventory for both the free- and forced-convection
systems is at a minimum with a core diameter of
about 8 ft for a thermal output of 60 Mw. For an
8-ft-dia core the specific powers are 895 and
1275 kw of heat per kilogram of U235 for the free-
and forced-convection systems, respectively. The
free-convection system is thus estimated to require
a fuel inventory about 42% greater than that of the
forced-convection system. With higher thermal
outputs the specific powers would be larger, but
the specific power for the forced-convection reactor
increases more rapidly with increasing power than
does that of the free-convection reactor.

HIGH-FLUX REACTORS
W. K. Ergen

A systematic study’ was started to determine
the influence of various factors on the power
required to obtain a given flux. At the beginning
of the study, a reactor idealized in the manner
described below was considered.?

The fuel is concentrated in a spherical shell
embedded in an infinite moderator; that is, the
moderator occupies the space inside as well as
outside the shell. The shell is “infinitely thin’
but “‘black’’ for thermal neutrons; that is, the
thickness of the shell is small compared with its
radius but large compared with the diffusion length
in the fuel. The shell emits 7f fission neutrons
for each thermal neutron absorbed. Absorptions
at epithermal energies, both in the fuel and the
moderator, are neglected. In this model, the

fission neutrons emitted from the shell slow down

according to the age kernel® and then diffuse

according to diffusion theory, with the boundary
condition created by the ‘‘black’’ shell.

For this model, it is possible to compute the
number, J, of neutrons which return, at thermal
energy, to the shell per fission neutron emitted.
The neutrons returning to the shell give Jnf fission
neutrons, and if the reactor is to be critical

Jof = 1.

From this equation, the required 7/ has been
computed? for D,0, Be, BeO, and C moderators
and for various values of shell radius. The results
are plotted in Figs. 1.4.3 through 1.4.6. The
abscissa of each plot gives the shell radius, r, in
cm, and also in dimensionless units p = r/\T,
where \/T is the slowing-down length.

In the sphere enclosed by the shell (the island,

or internal thermal column, or flux trap) the neutrons

Reactor, ORNL CF-58-1-4 (to be published).

PERIOD ENDING JANUARY 31, 1958

reach thermal energies at some distance from the
shell, and, in the process of diffusing toward the
shell, these neutrons set up a flux gradient, which
results in high fluxes at the center. These center
fluxes are also plotted in Figs. 1.4.3 through 1.4.6.
It may be seen that for Be and BeO a flux of 10-3
neutrons/cm? per fission neutron emitted is ob-
tained, which corresponds to about 140 Mw for
10'¢ neutrons/cm2.sec. For D,0 and C the flux
per fission neutron is smaller, and hence the power
required for 10'¢ neutrons/cm2.sec is higher. This
is primarily due to the large diffusion constants
of D,0 and C, which make it possible for the
neutrons to reach the shell without setting up a
very large flux gradient.

The curves are, of course, applicable only to the
idealized model. Present investigations cover the
modifications caused by more realistic assumptions,
such as holes in the shell, finite thickness of the
shell, moderation in the shell, and flux depression
in the flux trap as a result of insertion of absorbing
samples.

D YNAMIC CORROSION STUDIES

J. H. DeVan

Corrosion experiments are under way for which
thermal-convection loops and forced-circulation
loops were fabricated of Inconel (nominal compo-
sition: 15 wt % Cr, 7 wt % Fe, bal Ni) and of
INOR-8 (nominal composition: 17 wt % Mo,
6 wt % Fe, 6 wt % Cr, bal Ni). As discussed
previously, the test program is being conducted in
three distinct phases.! In the first phase, relative
corrosion properties of 12 fluoride salt mixtures
are being determined in thermal-convection loops
operated for 1000 hr. During the quarter, tests of
Inconel loops were completed for all the salts
except salt 131 (LiF-BeF ,-UF ,, 60-36-4 mole %);
four salts were tested in INOR-8 loops, which are
now being examined. As part of phase 2 of the
program, three salts are being circulated in Inconel
loops and five in INOR-8 loops. The tests will be
run for extended periods at two temperature levels,
1250 and 1350°F, In the third and final phase of
the test program, salts are being tested in forced-
circulation loops under simulated reactor operating
conditions. Four-salts are presently being tested
in Inconel loops and three in INOR-8 loops, as
described in Chap. 1.2 of this report. The results
of postoperative examinations of these loops will
be described in this chapter as they are completed.

Ten of the Inconel. loops operated in phase 1 of
the program have been examined metallographically.

After successful operation for 1000 ‘hr, the salt -
‘mixture in each’ loop was allowed “to freeze in
place. “Samples were then cut from each’ loop at
- the - locations shown in Fig. 2.11, and the salt’
contained in’ ‘each sample was melted out under a’
helium’ ‘atmosphere. The results of metallographic.
examination of the samples are presented in Table =
2. L 1 ond are discussed below.

1169 showed less than 1 mil of attack throughout
(Fig. 2.1.2), while loop 1177 was, in general,
attacked to a depth of less than 1 mil (Fig. 2.1.3)
but had scattered pits to a depth of 1.5 mils in
some areas,

operated to evaluate salt mixtures 124 (NaF-BeF ,-

loop 1173, in which salt 124 was circulated, was
attacked substantially more than loop 1176, which’
circulated salt 127, This result is in conflict,

however, with the corrosion properties normally
‘exhibited by. NaF-BeF, and LiF-BeF, mixtures;
~ in previous tests the LiF-BeF, mixtures tended

‘to produce more initial corrosion in Inconel sys-
tems than NaF-BeF, mixtures produced, Thus the
test results for loop 1173 are questionable, and a
repeat test under similar conditions has been

Four loops (1170, 1171, 1172, and 1175) that
circulated uranium-bearing or coolant salts were
also examined, and the results are presented in
“Table 2.1.1. Loop 1170, which circulated a

1161, which was operated previously with a salt

Results of Examination of Samples Removed
from Forced-Circulation Loop CPR

As stated in Chap. 1.2, samples were taken for
metallographic examination from the forced-cireu-
lation bifluid loop designated CPR. The samples
were taken from a portion of the hot leg which
ruptured when the salt froze because of a power
failure after more than 6500 hr of operation, A
sample taken from the discharge end of the heated

leg showed no measurable corrosion (Fig. 2.1.6),
but samples taken from near the point at which

the failure occurred, that is, near the inlet to the
heated leg, revealed attack to a depth of 2 mils
(Fig. 2.1.7). The deeper attack at this point was

- probably the result of fuel contamination near the
point of failure, The loop was successfully re-
paired and is now back in operation.

Additional data were obtained from two Inconel
thermal-convection loops with graphite inserts in
which fuel ‘30 was circulated,” These loops (Nos.
30. and 39) were constructed as shown in Fig.

than 0.0005 in, in thickness. In scattered regions
the film penetrated into the specimen along the
graphite particles; the maximum penetration of
this sort was to a depth of 0.005 in,

A microspark analysis of the inner surface of the

‘CCN graphite insert showed that the main com-
ponents, in the order of decreasing quantity, were
zirconium, chromium, and uranium and that there
were traces of sodium and nickel. It is to be
noted, in particular, that chromium and nickel were

detected along with the cations of the salt. A"

quantitative -analysis of millings from the graphite
‘surface will be made in order to determine which
of these five components are from the metallic-
appearing film and to determine the quantities
present, The results of these thermal-convection
loop tests indicate,” however, that at 1300°F the
carburization of Inconel in such systems is
probably a slow process, if it occurs at all,

Static capsule tests at 1500°F have also been
made in the study of the effect of carbon on Inconel
and INOR-8 (heat SP-16) in sodium, in NaF-BeF,-
UF, (53-46-1 mole %, fuel 123), ond in LiF-BeF ,-

UF, (62-37-1 mole %, fuel 130). These 100-hr

58

static tests at 1500°F were primarily to determine
which material, INOR-8 or Inconel, carburized most
readily when exposed to graphite under the same
conditions and to compare the carburization rates
of the materials in fuels and in sodium.

The specimens used in these ‘tests were small
coupons, 40 mils thick, that were held in graphite
sleeves in Inconel capsules. The metal -speci-
mens and the sodium or fuel were loaded into these
capsules under a purified argon. atmosphere and
then sealed by inert-arc welding. EE

Metallographic examinations indicated, as shown
in Table 2.1.3, that INOR-8 is more susceptible to
carburization than is Inconel ‘under- these condi-
tions. - This is due to the molybdenum in the

INOR-8 forming carbides more easily than the

chromium in Inconel. For example, it is known
that type 316 stainless steel, which contains 2 to
3% - molybdenum, carburizes more readily thon
similar austenitic stainless steels which do not
contain. molybdenum.2 The appearance of the
INOR-8 after the test is shown in Fig. 2.1.14,

Corrosion of INOR-8 Welds by NaK and by

D. H. Jansen

INOR-8 plates from heat SP-16 that were welded
with various nickel-molybdenum-base welding rods
have been corrosion tested in seesaw-furnace
apparatus at a hot-zone temperature of 1200°F in

60

NaK (56-44 wt %) and in fuel 130 for 500 hr.
These tests were conducted because the weld
metals contained some minor constituents that
have shown limited corrosion resistance to these
mixtures; however, no attack was found on any of
the welds. The compositions of the welding rods
are given in Table 2.1.4, along with the observed
weight changes and the results of metallographic
examinations of the tested welds,

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF INOR-8
D. A. Douglas

Tests are under way for obtaining the basic data
on the strength of INOR-8 required for design
calculations. The confidence level which can be
applied to the data and the variables which affect
the reproducibility of the data will be defined.
Studies will also be made of the behavior of the
metal under both static and dynamic loadings in
order to more accurately predict the service life
of various component parts.

Since relatively long periods are required to
obtain data on plastic properties, preliminary data
on tensile properties are being obtained for use

in design studies. The yield strength at 0.2%
offset and the rupture strengths of INOR-8 were

measured - in the temperature range of 1000 to

"1300°F and at room temperature. = The results of
: the measurements are summarized in Table 2. 1.9.

The data’ presented i in Table 2 1.9. were obtained

on sheet specimens ond must be considered: as
approximate because of experimental errors in the
“elastic portion of the stress-strain data. Errors
occur partly ‘because it ‘is difficult to. achieve -
accurate alignment with a sheet specimen and oo
partly because subsize specimens are sensitive to
experimental variations. Conventional. specimens

0.505 in. in diameter are being machined from a
wrought bar so that more accurate values can be
obtained.

The study of the plastic properties of INOR-8
is being made in order to determine whether INOR-8
will deform plastically under reactor operating
conditions. In the relaxation tests used for this
study, a specimen is loaded to a fixed amount of
strain ond the resulting elongation is maintained
either by adding to the load or by subtracting from
it. The need to remove the load to maintain the
fixed strain would indicate that the material de-
formed plastically. The results of a series of
tests at 1200 and 1300°F are summarized in Table
2.1.10,

The large decrease in stress with time indicated
that the plastic properties of the INOR-8 were
important and that the creep strength would have
to be investigated. Creep tests are therefore

under way at stresses of 12,000 to 30,000 psi with

the specimens exposed to fuel 107 at 1100, 1200,
and 1300°F, The status of these tests is pre-
sented in Table 2.1.11.
Tests were also performed at temperatures con-
siderably" above the anticipated operating tempera-
ture of the reactor as a means of gaging the damage

to the metal which might occur through accidental

temperature excursions, . These results are .pre-

sented in Fig, 2.1.16.

“Another series of tests will be run in order to

~ obtain a statistical estimate of the reproducibility

of creep results from one test to another and from
one heat of material to another. These tests will

be conducted in air at 1250°F,

WELDING AND BRAZING STUDIES
G. M. Slaughter
Metal Seals for Remote-Disconnect Flanged Joints

In the development of mechanical joints that can
be disconnected by remotely controlled mecha-
nisms, it has been necessary to investigate various
types of seals. Tests have been made of the
feasibility of heating a sealing material in an
annulus to make or break the seal or of pouring
molten metal into a preheated and clamped flange
assembly, The results of mockup tests of such a

64

 

joint, designated *‘cast-metal-sealed flange joint,”

are presented in Chap. 1.2,

A survey of phase diagrams of possible seal and
flange materials which should be relatively
immiscible in each other indicated that the silver-
nickel system might be useful. Silver and iron
were found to be virtually insoluble in each other,
and copper and iron possess only limited solu-
bility in each other. It also seems probable that
the silver-copper eutectic alloy, Handy & Harman
alloy BT, which melts at 1435°F, could be used

with iron-base flange materials,

diffusion. The excellent wetting of nickel by
silver in dry helium is indicated by the small
contact angle shown in Fig. 2.1.18, An even
smaller contact angle was found on the nickel-BT
alloy sample. Metallographic examination of the
silver-nickel interface revealed no penetration of
silver into the nickel after brazing and after sub-
sequent aging for 500 hr at 1200°F, Only slight
penetration of nickel by the silver-copper alloy
was observed after aging. The marginal wetting
of INOR-8 and Inconel by silver in dry helium is
illustrated by the contact angle of approximately
90 deg shown in Fig. 2.1.19. The BT alloy ex-
hibited very poor wetting on both INOR-8 and
Inconel. The wetting of iron by silver and the BT
alloy in dry helium was poor and intermittent,

The deposition of an electrolytic nickel plate on
Inconel and INOR-8 samples was found, however, .
to promote good wetting by both silver and the BT
alloy. The nickel plate was not penetrated by
silver, but there was some solution of the nickel
plate by the BT alloy. The deposition of an
electrolytic silver plate on the electrolytic nickel
plate did not improve the wetting by either alloy.
Aging experiments at 1200°F are now under way
on electroplated materials,

A preliminary sealing test specimen was de-
veloped that consisted of a nickel tube and a
nickel container in which the seal could be made
with silver under a dry helium atmosphere. The
joint was made and broken four times, and the
joint was leaktight after each sealing. Thus there
appears to be excellent wetting of nickel by silver
under repeated heating and cooling cycles. As
stated above, mockups of cast-metal-sealed flange
joints are being tested that utilize the results of

"these studies.

Welding of INOR-8 Tubing
“G. M. Slaughter
Before the fabrication of INOR-8 tubing from heat

-SP-16 into the various corrosion loops of interest

was initiated, it was ‘decided that a metallurgical
investigation of typical welds should be conducted,
A preliminary investigation, described previously, 4

indicated’ that the use of SP-16 filler wire for the
welding of Ye in. plate from heat SP-16 was, in

general, unsatisfactory ‘because of ‘weld-metal

cracking, Also, welds made on similar specimens

these welds undoubtedly explain the presence of
base-metal cracks in the saddle welds and the
freedom from cracks in the lower restraint butt
welds. Since the detection of these defects cannot
be ensured by radiography or dye-penetrant in-
spection, it is recommended that the SP-16 tubing
not be used for critical applications, such as in-

of the influence of welding. The results of the
preliminary hardness measurements on test plates
38 and 40 are presented in Table 2.1.13. In com-
parison, the hardness of Hastelloy B and W weld
metals in the as-welded condition is approximately
20 on the Rockwell C scale, which is approxi-
mately equal to a value of 98 on the Rockwell B
scale. After aging at 1300°F for 200 hr, the hard-

ness of Hastelloy W weld metal rises to approxi-

mately 32 on the Rockwell C scale, while that of

Hastelloy B rises to approximately 41.

It may be seen that heat 30-38 weld metal is
slightly harder in both the as-welded and aged
conditions than Haynes SP-16 weld metal. How-
ever, no significant hardening that can be attributed
to aging is evident for either alloy. Both these
alloys are: considerably softer after aging than
either Hastelloy BorW,

can be allowed. The type of inspection of an NC
weld will depend on its application.

The amount of penetration allowable on C and
CN welds made on tubing has been increased from
0.025 to 0.035 in., because there was difficulty
in maintaining such a tight tolerance and the test
loop work now in progress does not require such
rigid control.

A total of 131 C welds made on INOR-8 material
was inspected, and the rejection rate was 9%,
which is less than one-half the rejection rate
previously found for Inconel welds. A total of
248 C welds and 197 CN and S welds on other
materials was also inspected, with 57 C welds and
3 CN and S welds being rejected.

Failure Analyses

A Chromel-Alumel thermocouple which failed
after 240 thermal cycles between 800 and 1200°F
in NaK was inspected to determine the cause of
the failure. The thermocouple was encased in a
protective Inconel well, and therefore it was
necessary to locate the failure by radiographic
inspection. A break was indicated on one of the
wires near the thermocouple junction, and metallo-
graphic sections were taken at the failed area.
The thermocouple wire at the break had necked
down considerably, and thus a ductile tensile
failure was indicated. Since the junction of the
thermocouple had been firmly attached to the
bottom of the well, failure appeared to be the
result of differential expansion between the
thermocouple wires and the surrounding Inconel
well,

IN-PILE THERMAL- CONVECTION LOOP TESTS

WE Browning
H. E. Robertson” = .~ "R. P. Shields

The electrically heated full-scale mockup of the
in-pile thermal-convection loop, described previ-
ously, was: welded and filled with fuel in a dry
box. The fuel. mixture BeF, -LiF- UF, (37-62-1
mole %, fuel 130) containing dapleted uranium and
normal lithium will be circulated in’ the mockup,
which, like the in-pile loop, is fabricated of
INOR-8 "alloy. Thermocouples and heaters are
now being installed on the mockup to demonstrate
the workability of the design and to provide
operating information for use in the in-pile loop
tests. ’

Mechanical mockup ‘tests were performed on a
series of thermocouple leads being considered for

service in ‘the cooling-air annulus of the loop.

Since thermal expansion of the fuel tubes damaged
thermocouples in previously operated loops, it was
desired to select a design which would prevent
plastic deformation of the thermocouple lead wires.
The mechanical mockup test was performed in an

“apparatus which was similar to a portion of the
“fuel tube and cooling-air-annulus tube, with the

outer parts made of transparent plastic to permit

observation of the thermocouple during expansion

of the fuel tube. The various thermocouple lead

wire assemblies being considered were tested in
this. ‘apparatus in order to determine the effect of
longitudinal ‘movement of the fuel tube of as much
~ cas. by in. Radial-movement of the fuel tube in the
loop is prevented by. radial -spacer pins.
“thermocouple ‘assembly ‘selected consists ‘of ‘a:
thin-walled stainless steel tube which fits closely
“around “a’.ceramic insulator” tube. The: stainless -
steel tube - is split’ af the end. “and is resistance

“the thermocouple bead is joined to the fuel tube.”

tudinally during thermal expansion, the thermo-
couple jacket moves longitudinally along its own
axis through the port in the air annulus and through
the heater assembly, and it moves slightly with
respect to the bundle of lead wires. This arrange-
ment provides a relatively rigid structural member
which does not move with respect to the thermo-
couple wire or the thermocouple bead, and thus
does not apply stress to the thermocouple. Thermo-
couples of this type have survived dozens of
cycles in which the thermal expansion was many
times greater than that expected in the loop.

The in-pile loop is to include a charcoal trap
for removing the xenon which will diffuse from
the surface of the fuel. Any organic material
and water present. in the charcoal as an impurity
would be decomposed by radiation from adsorbed
fission products, and the decomposition products
could contaminate the fuel and interfere with
interpretation of the results of the experiment.
The charcoal used in the loop will therefore be
baked in vacuum for 48 hr at 500°C in order to
decompose organic impurities. The charcoal which
was installed in the mockup loop was subjected
to this treatment. The holdup time of the heat-
treated. charcoal for radiokrypton in a flowing
helium stream was measured to determine whether
the heat treatment had reduced the capacity of the
charcoal for noble gases. It was found that the
charcoal was 10% more effective as an absorber
for krypton after the heat treatment than it had
been before. . This effect was no’ doubt the result

of f dehydration: of the charcoal.

“Calculations were made to determine the magni-
ude of undesirable effects of the Lié isotope in
“the fuel for the in-pile loop. The effects con-
“sidered were (1) the flux depression that would
result. from absorption of thermal neutrons by the
Lis ,. (2) “the “biological hazard that would be’
present in the event of an accidental release of -
“the tritium that would be produced by the (n,a)
“reaction in Li%, (3) the internal ‘gas pressure that
‘would be “generated by nuclear reaction products
from Lié ’, and (4) “the possible chemical effects
of the tritium equivalent of HF and the consequent
interference with the interpretation of the results
of the experiment. All these effects were found

79

 
 

 

 

MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR PROGRAM PROGRESS REPORT

to be unimportant except the last one. The
possible effects of traces of tritium in the loop
cannot be evaluated with sufficient confidence
to risk operating the in-pile loop under such
conditions. “It was decided therefore to obtain
the best available Li’ for use in the in-pile test.
Lithium containing 99.8% Li’ was obtained and
was used in the production of a batch of fuel 130
(see Chap. 2.3 for production details). Sufficient

fuel for filling three loops is now available in

powder form.

Preparations are being made in the ORR feo-
cilities for the operation of a similar forced-
circulation loop. The loop assembly housing and
lead “tube have been fabricated for use in pre-
liminary hydraulic tests of the reactor before
startup. These tests will show whether the lead
tube is structurally adequate in the reactor cooling-
water stream. The same assembly is being used
for surveys of ‘the flux in the experimental space
designated for this experiment. Conduit trays
and an auxiliary control panel are being installed
to carry lead wires from the experimental assembly
in the reactor to the laboratory, where the controls
for the loop will be located.

IN-PILE STATIC CAPSULE TESTS
H. L. Hemphill

Preparations for the irradiation of fuel 130 in
INOR-8 capsules in the MTR were continued. The
fuel used in these test capsules will be the same

W. E. Browning

as that used in the in-pile thermal-convection

loop. The {NOR-8 tubing intended for use in
fabricating these capsules had to be rejected
because of high aluminum content. Another batch

-80

of INOR-8 tubing of satisfactory composition con-
tained a large number of flaws. Short sections of
this batch of tubing are being selected for use
in the MTR capsules. The INOR-8 tubing for the
MTR capsules is more difficult to fabricate than
that used in the thermal-convection loop because
of the small diameter and large wall thickness,
0.200 in. OD and 0.100 in. ID.

Other capsules are being fabricated for irradi-
ation in the MTR in order to determine the stability
of graphite in: contact with fuel 130 during ex-
posure to radiation. Existing Inconel capsules
are being used for the outer containers. Graphite
liners with 0.025-in.-thick walls have been pre-
pared that have a 0.100-in.-dia bore and are 1 in.
in length. These graphite liners will have a loose
plug at the top end and three small holes near the
bottom to allow the fuel to fill the space inside
the -graphite liner and the space between the liner
and the Inconel outer can. The fuel will provide
heat transfer between the graphite and the Inconel
wall, and fairly accurate estimates of the graphite
temperatures can be based on measurements of
the temperature of the wall, the thermal con-
ductivity of the graphite, and the heat generation

by fission in the fuel. These capsules will be

irradiated at a metal wall temperature of 1250°F.

After irradiation the capsules will be examined
in the Solid State Division hot cells in order to
determine whether the graphite disintegrated. If
the graphite is intact, an attempt will be made to
determine the distribution of fuel components and
fission products in the graphite. The graphite
and the Inconel will be examined metallograph-
ically for evidences of corrosion, and the fuel will
be chemically analyzed for carbon and the con-
stituents of Inconel.

content. As the UF, content increases, the solid

solution changes from uniaxial positive to uniaxial
negative. Further, for mixtures containing about
31 mole % UF, the solid solution should be
isotropic.  Quenches of such mixtures have
produced 7LiF-6ThF -7LiF.6UF , solid solutions
that have birefringences which are too low to
measure microscopically.

The curvatures of the ThF -UF, solid-solution

In the system diagram presented in Fig. 2.3.11,
the temperatures of points a and c¢ are 500 and
488°C, respectively. Consequently the LiF-
4LiF.UF, boundary curve temperatures drop from
point a to point c. The temperatures of points ¢
and d are 488 and 500°C, respectively. Conse-
quently the boundary curve between the LiF
primary-phase field and the 7Li F-6ThF ,-7LiF.6UF

solid-solution primary-phase field drops in temper-

.ature from point d to point c. In addition, evidence

exists (Table 2.3.2) that 4LiF.UF, appears as a
third solid phase in compositions along this

compositions along the boundary curve between the
4LiF UF , primary-phase field and the 7LiF 6 ThF,-

Solubility and Stability of PuF,
Molten Fluorides

C. J. Barton R. A. Strehlow

Values for the solubility of PuF, in NaF-BeF,
(57-43 mole %) at three temperatures were given in
the previous report.3 During the past quarter,
values were obtained for the solubility of PuF in
two additional NaoF-BeF, mixtures, three LiF-BeF,
compositions, and one NaF- LiF- BeF mixture
ds a function of temperature. The range of BeF
concentrations covered in each of the binary
solvent systems, approximately 36 to 50 mole %,
includes the concentration range likely to be of
interest in the MSR program. Binary mixtures with

lower BeF, concentrations have too high liquidus -

temperatures to be useful at power reactor temper-

_ atures, and the viscosity of mixtures containing

more than 50 mole % BeF, is too high to make
them attractive. The ternary solvent mixture was
included in the study to permit solubility de-
terminations with a lower BeF, concentration than
would have been possible in the binary systems
at the lower limit of the temperature range studied,

3C. J. Barton et al.,, MSR Quar, Prog. Rep. Oct.’ 31,
1957, ORNL-2431, p 39.

The results obtained to date in these studies
are presented in Table 2.3.3. Some of the results
are ‘almost certainly incorrect and will be checked
in new filtration experiments as soon as possible.
The possibility of analytical error was minimized
in most of the doubtful results by repeating the
analysis, either with a new portion of the some
sample or a separate portion of the original
sample. Except for the first few samples sub-
mitted for analysis, which were ground but not
sieved, all filtrates were ground either to ~65 or
~200 mesh ond mixed thoroughly to avoid the
possibility of inhomogeneity. A possible cause of
the observed discrepancies in the dato would be
an error in the measurement of the temperature of
the liquid salt mixture. A fairly large vertical
temperature gradient is known to exist in the
heated zone. occupied by the fused salt container,
and it is possible that the thermocouple was
accidentally shifted in the course of the experi-

ments. An additional uncertainty in the determi-

nation of the melt temperatures resulted from the
thermocouple wells in most of the filter bottles
used in these experiments being shorter than the
design called for; the ends of the wells were not
in contact with the melts. Improved filter bottles
that have thinner walled thermocouple wells of
the proper length to permit the thermocouple
junction to be surrounded by the salt mixture
became available near the end of the quarter ond
were used for the last two measurements made,

mixtures. This has been accomplished by de-
termining the plutonium species present in cooled
samples of filtrates and unfiltered residues
produced by filtering mixtures that had been
heated at temperatures of 550 to 650°C for periods
that were usually in excess of 2 hr. The plutonium
compounds present in the mixtures were identified
by petrographic examination, and valence de-
terminations were made by spectrophotometric
examination of dissolved portions of the samples.
Only trivalent plutonium has been found in the
mixtures examined to date. In addition, the bottom
portions of two nickel filter bottles used in
"filtration experiments were submitted for analysis
after removal of all except a trace of fused salt.
One sample had been in contact with the NaF-
BeF ,-PuF, mixture ot 600°C for about 2 hr and
the other had contained the LiF-BeF ,-PuF
mixture at temperatures varying from 500 to 650°C
for approximately 8 hr. The plutonium found in the
two samples amounted to 0.05 and 0.17 mg,
respectively, and could be accounted for by the
trace of fused salt remaining on the nickel. No
evidence of disproportionation of PuF, in fused
alkali fluoride=beryllium fluoride melts under the
conditions maintained in these experiments has
been observed to date.

FUSED CHLORIDES AS SECONDARY HEAT
TRANSFER FLUIDS

R. E. Moore

The physical, chemical, and nuclear properties
of a secondary coolant for a molten. salt: power
reactor must satisfy a number of requirements.
The following characteristics are desired:

1. low melting point,

2. low viscosity,

3. high heat capacity,

4. high thermal conductivity,

5. low vapor pressure,

6. stability toward structural metals,

7. reasonably low thermal-neutron cross section,
8. freedom from activation in a radiation field.

Fluorides and chlorides seem to offer the best
choices among possible salt systems. Melting
points of 300°C and lower can be obtained with
fluoride mixtures containing ‘BeF,, but the
viscosities of these mixtures are high. If a low
melting point accompanied by a low viscosity is
to be obtained it is necessary to turn to chloride
systems,

90

A large number of chloride systems have been
described in the literature, but, after an elimination
process - based on gross ‘deviations from the
properties listed above, there remained only a few
systems for further consideration. The eutectic
compositions (mole %) and melting temperatures of
these systems are listed below:

Melting

Composition Temperature

(°c)

41.7 mole % RbC|-58.3 mole % LiCl 318

64 mole % ZnCl, -36 mole % SnCl, 171

38 mole % KCl—62 mole % SnCl, 180

29 mole % KCl_71 mole % ZnCl, 262

23 mole % LiCl-~77 mole % ZnCl, 294

47.5 mole % RbCl-52,5 mole % ZnCl, 249

The very low melting points of the last five
mixtures listed would seem to make these compo-
sitions especially attractive. ~All these mixtures
contain, however, either SnCl, or ZnCl,, which
have high vapor pressures, although the pressures
are possibly not high enough to interfere with
pump operation in the coolant circuit. A caleu-
lation of the ideal vapor pressure of the 29 mole %
KCI-71 mole % ZnCl, mixture, based on literature
values for ZnCl,, gave values of 140 mm Hg at

650°C and 1.4 mm Hg at 450°C. The actual

pressures may be somewhat lower than the ideal.
Vapor pressures of the mixtures containing SnCl,
would be expected to be much higher than those
for mixtures’ containing ZnCl, because the boiling
point of SnCl, (623°C) is considerably lower than
the boiling point of ZnCl, (732°C).

Another important question concerning compo-
sitions containing SnCl, or ZnCl, is the possibility
of reaction with structural metals. Calculations
based on values of free energies of formation
indicate that considerable reaction may occur,
especially in the case of SnCl, mixtures. There
is enough uncertainty in the calculations, however,
that static corrosion tests should be made. Plans
are being made for experiments in which Inconel
will be exposed to molten mixtures containing
ZnCl, and SnCl, in sealed containers of fused
silica.

4A. Glassner, A Survey of the Free Energies of

Formation of the Fluorides, Chlorides, and Oxides of
the Elements to 2500°K, ANL-5107 (Aug. 1953).

 
 

 

9 ¢

The eutectic composition 41.7 mole % RbCl-58.3
mole % LiCl appears to be the most attractive
from the standpoints of vapor pressure and
corrosion. The boiling points of RbCl and LiCl
(1390 and 1353°C) are sufficiently high that the
vapor pressure of the mixture should be negligible
at reactor temperatures. Calculations based on
values of the free energies of formation? indicate
that the mixture should be extremely stable in
contact with Inconel. Thermal-convection loop
tests should be made to determine the rate of
mass transfer. The new low prices of rubidium
salts (quoted by American Potash & Chemical

for solubilities in mixtures containing ZrF ,. The
solubilities follow Henry's law, increase with
increasing - temperature, and decrease with in-

Fig. 2.3.15. There is a remarkable increase in
HF solubility with increasing NaF concentration.

Preliminary results obtained for the solubility
of HF in NaF-KF-LiF (11.5-42-46.5 mole %) are
presented in Fig. 2.3.16. Since the liquid structure
of this solvent might be assumed to approximate
that of molten NaF, the value of the solubility of
HF in the NaF-KF-LiF system may be used at
0 mole % ZrF, in Fig. 2.3.17. This curve was
.constructed from solubility measurements of
solvents containing 19.5, 35, 40, 47, and 55 mole %
ZrF ,. The regions from 0 to 19.5 and from 19.5 to
35 mole % ZrF, were interpolated because of the
high melting points of the corresponding NaF-Z¢F
mixtures. The heat of solution of HF as a function
of solvent composition is shown in Fig. 2.3.18.

The curves presented in Fig. 2.3.17 reveal a
50-fold increase in HF solubility as the ZrF,
concentration decreases from 55 to 0 mole %. The
heat of solution increases about threefold in the
corresponding composition range. Similar corre-
lations will be attempted as other solvents are
studied.

mixtures was initiated, and the results obtained to

The activity, based on the solid as standard
state, of CeF, in a 1 mole % solution in LiF-
BeF, would be of the order of 103; the activity,
based on the solid as standard state, of BeF
in a 70-30 mole % mixture of LiF- BeF, would be
of the order of 10-2; and the estimated ratio of

a2, /a3ek, is about 1. Since the calculated

equilibrium ratio of activities is much greater than
the estimated ratio, it may be concluded that BeO

will precipitate before Ce 205 precipitates. Since

the calculated equilibrium. ratio is so large, most

_ of the BeF, will probably precipitate before any

Ce, 0, precipitates. These conclusions are true
only i} the BeO and Ce ,0, form no compounds and
do not form solid solutions. If CeO, precipitates
readily it must be as a ‘compound o Solid solution
with BeO.

The order of precipitation of U4* and Ce *** may

be studied in a similar manner. The AF° for the

= 10553 = 2 x 1055 .

The activities of UF, and CeF are of the order
of 10-3 for a 1 mole % solution of these two
substances, and a crude approximation of the ratio
ade Jade would give a value of 10=3. Since

this is much smaller than the ratio calculated in
Eq. 5, it is concluded that UO, will precipitate
almost completely before any Ce 203 precipitates.
This conclusion is subject to the condition that
only pure Ce,0, or UO, can precipitate. These
sample calculations illustrate the utility of even
crude approximations to the activities of com-
ponents of salt mixtures. The same conclusions
would have been obtained even if the individual
activities had been in error by aon order of
magnitude,

cordingly, the solubility and some selective
precipitation reactions of a variety of solutes are
being studied. In order to avoid complications,
the simple binary mixture of LiF and KF was
chosen as a solvent.

PERIOD ENDING JANUARY 31, 1958

On the basis of direct and indirect information
gained from the experiments completed thus far,
the following useful generalizations can be made
regarding the solubility of oxides of uranium,
zirconium, hafnium, rare earths, alkaline earths,
and alkali metals in this solvent:

1. Uranium, zirconium, and hafnium precipitate
as the dioxides and are the least soluble.

2. Rare earths precipitate as R,0, and have
very low solubilities,

3. Beryllium and magnesium oxides are slightly
more soluble than the rare earth oxides but are
still quite insoluble.

4. Borium, strontium, calcium, potassium,
sodium, and lithium oxides are more soluble than
the oxides specified in items 1, 2, and 3.

Quantitative measurements of the solubilities of
the relatively insoluble oxides are difficult to
make, because the solubilities are so low as to be
below the direct limit of detection of the radio-
chemical method used. However, extrapolations
have been made in order to estimate the concen-
tration of the particular metal ion remaining in
solution in the presence of some 25% excess
precipitating agent (usually CaO or Na,0,). The
results are presented in Table 2.3.12.

Several separations of solutes appear to be
possible on the basis of the selective precipitation
of oxides obtained in the experiments. The
results of the experiments are presented in
Figs. 2.3.22, 2.3.23, and 2.3.24, which show the
concentration of solutes that remained in the
liquid as the system was titrated by the stepwise
addition of CaO. For example, Figs. 2.3.22 and

In order to determine the concentration of zir-
conium radiochemically, the zirconium was labeled
with Hf18), and the hafnium was dssumed to
behave like zirconium. The titration curve shows
the assumption to be sound.

The titration of the mixture CeF -BeF, with CaO
is shown in Fig. 2.3.26. From the curve it may be
seen that cerium and beryllium are precipitated
simultaneously but not in definite proportions;
they probably precipitate as a solid solution.
The results are summarized in Table 2.3.13. It
has been suggested!? that the results of this
experiment indicate that an attempt should be
made to precipitate cerium from the solution by
adsorption on an excess of BeO. Accordingly,
attempts are being made to precipitate not only
cerium but also uranium.

some extent from the restriction that isotopically
pure Li7 must be used. The discarding of the Li’
contained in these fuels after the maximum
allowable poison concentration had accumulated
would place a moderately serious cost burden on
the power produced from a lithium-containing fuel.

Either of two approaches may be used to increase
the utility of the fuel. Fuels from which the
lanthanides can be removed can, of course, be
reprocessed and reused. This presumably is the
case for LiF-BeF -base fuels in which the
principal residual (Ronlanthanide) poisons would
be primarily elements which are more noble than

‘beryllium. If, on the other hand, the rare earths

cannot be conveniently removed, the lithium must,
perforce, be removed from the balance of the fuel.

This is the case for alkali fluoride melts con-
© taining combinations . of lithium, sodium, and

potassium . fluorides. ~~

1t would :be desirable to be able to remove the
lithium from NaF-KF-LiF mixtures by a simple
high-temperature technique and for the product to
be in a concentrated form and free from rare-earth
contamination. It may be seen from Table 2.3.14,
which “shows the free energies of formation at

1000°K of some halides, that samarium halides
~are “considerably more stable than - the corre-

sponding alkali metal halides. Although, among
the alkali metal halides, lithium forms the most
stable fluoride, potassium forms the most stable

possible that the reaction described by

‘might be made to occur if, for example, potassium
chloride - or bromide were added in sufficient
amount to a mixture of the fluorides. Although
sodium would be extracted to a greater extent than
lithium, its presence in small amount is not a
serious consideration. The equilibrium constant

then cooled to 150°C to permit the salt to solidify,
and two samples of the molten potassium were
taken. Although the sampling temperature was
below the consolute temperature for the Li-K
system, it was suitable for any small ratios of
a; ;/ag. A modified metal-sampling apparatus 4
was used which permitted samples of liquid metal
to be obtained under an inert atmosphere. Two
quantities of KCl were then added in amounts of
100 and 300 g. The mixture was equilibrated, and
the metal phase was sampled after each addition in
the manner described above.

Analyses gave values for the three determinations
of Ny ,/Ng = 10=4 and of N__ = 0, 0.16, and

0.35, respectively. One equilibration of a mixture

of KI-Lil-K containing less than 0.05 mole fraction
‘of fluoride was carried out, and a value of
Np ;/Ng = 0.35 was obtained.

These results
indicate that the estimates described here and
presented in Table 2.3.15 may be accepted as
being of the correct order of magnitude. This
leads to the conclusion that, at probable Li7
price levels, this process is not economically
feasible.

calculations are based on the assumption that the--

circulating salt initially contains equilibrium
concentrations of UF, UF, and CrF,, which are
‘independent of time. In an attempt to ompare the
calculated results with results of actual loop
experiments, a study was made of .four thermal
loop experiments 17 in which Cr3! was utilized to
trace the chromium migration patterns within the

loops. Several important points regarding the use

of radioactive tracers in loops were noted. in the
course of this work and are described below, since
they will be of definite value in investigations of
corrosion in polythermal loop systems. An outline
of the experimental conditions for the four loop
tests is given in Table 2.3.18. Three of the four
experiments, as indicated in Table 2.3.18, were
conducted with CrS! initially present only in the
salt, as Cr*F_. The results of ‘these first. three
experiments, in which Cr was initially absent
from the walls, do not give a direct indication of
the over-all chromium migration pattern as a
result of corrosion. To illustrate this point, a
combined plot of the experimental data for the
first three experiments of Table 2.3.18 is shown
in Fig. 2.3.29. If it is assumed that the loop wall
distribution patterns for Cr® and Cr® coincide, it
could be concluded from Fig. 2.3.29 that the zone
of maximum deposition of chromium as a result of
the reversal of the corrosion reaction is near
section A. By mass-balance calculations, A is
between the zones of maximum chromium corrosion
or depletion, C-C’ and the zones of maximum
deposition as a result of corrosion, .B-B% In
other words, the loop wall distribution patterns for

chromium is initially introduced to the system as

Cr F,.

Curve 2 of Fig. 2.3.29 shows a secondary
maximum near the region of the true deposition.
The original investigators 17 have suggested that
the shape of curve 2 is of greater significance
than are the shapes of curves 1 and 3, because the
loop operating time for the data of curve 2 was
400 hr as compared with 125 and 288 hr for curves
1 and 3, respectively. The salt in loop No. 3

"was, however, pre-equilibrated for 192 hr before

operation. It would seem that, if the secondary
maximum of curve 2 were truly significant, the
other two curves should have shown some tendency
toward the initial formation of such a maximum.
It is difficult to visualize a chromium transport

mechanism whereby the relative amount of
chromium deposited ot a point suddenly jumps
from a constant value of 30% of the ‘maximum to a
valve of 75% of the maximum after 288 hr of
operation. Calculated Cr51 distribution curves for
this type of experiment under conditions of perfect
pre-equilibration of the salt have the shape
exhibited by curves 1 and 3. They also have a
constant shape with respect to time when plotted
on a relative basis. The theory on which these
calculations were based is outlined below.

The Cr distribution under any experimental
procedure is governed by two chemical equilibria
at the wall surface, the most important of the two
being the wall exchange reaction

The net chromium migration across the wall surface’
is zero at these points. Accordingly the wall-
surface * chromium concentration at the balance
points is equal to the original chromium concen-
tration in the alloy.

In addition to the chemical equilibria at the
surface, the Cr (and Cr wall distribution is
governed by the concentration of Cr (and Cr°)
initially in the interior of the walls as a result of
the solid-state diffusion phenomena that are
characteristic of metals at high temperature.
Since linear diffusion in a semi-infinite medium is
involved, the distributions also depend on the
square root of the diffusion coefficient, D, for
chromium in Inconel. The diffusion coefficient is
practically the same for Cr° and for Cr, and the
value is very sensitive to temperature changes.

A combination numerical-schematic steady-
state example similar to conditions of the third
experiment and involving the various chromium
concentrations in three loop sections is presented
in Figs 2.3.30. Equations 1 and 3 were used to
prepare the example. It was assumed that, at

curves as those obtained experimentally (Fig.
2.3.29) because (1) Cr is always diffusing into
the walls along the entire loop, regardless of the
sign or value of the other flow rates, and (2) the
Cr diffusion rate is highest in the high-temper-
ature region,. since (am/dr)¢, o, is proportional to
(AC, 0.+DV/?) and D172 increases with temper-
ature, It: may be concluded that experiments
similar to the first three listed in Table 2,3.18
are of little value for corrosion studies because
the Cro distribution pattern is controlled by the
wall exchange reaction and wall temperature
“rather than by the corrosion reaction of interest.
In the fourth experiment, Cr35! ‘was initially
present both in the salt, as Cr*F,, ond in the
walls, as Cr, The labeled chromium migration

migration pattern of the corrosion, as shown

at 700°C. It is planned, in the future, to ascend
and descend the temperature scale between 750
and 1000°C with all cells.

The criterion of reversibility, however, has been
the cause of the early termination of several cell
experiments. Each cell as presently run contains
two alloy electrodes (usually of different compo-
sition) and two pure nickel electrodes that were
annealed at 2200°F for 16 hr after fabrication.
In general, one nickel electrode becomes erratic
either shortly after the start of a run or after
behaving properly for as. long as 12 days.
Potentials as high as 70 mv have been observed
between two nickel electrodes which two days
previously had been behaving properly and
exhibited no potential difference. . Cells .con-
taining four nickel electrodes from different
sources are now being run in an effort to discover
the cause of this anomalous behavior, No
explanation is evident to date.

PRODUCTION OF PURIFIED MIXTURES
J. P. Blakely G. J. Nessle
Preparation of Pure Fluorides

Some transition-metal fluorides of high purity
were prepared for use in studies of corrosion,
chemical equilibria, and phase relationships,
ond for use as reactants in the preparation of
other fluorides, including complexes. Nearly a
kilogram each of ferric, ferrous, nickelous, and
cobaltous fluorides were prepared. Ferric fluoride
was prepared by passing anhydrous hydrogen
fluoride gas over anhydrous ferric chloride at about
300°C. For preparing the ferrous, nickelous, and
cobaltous fluorides, the commercially available
hydrated chlorides were partially dehydrated at
about 100°C and treated with hydrogen fluoride
at about 400°C,

Small-Scale Purification Operations
C. R. Croft

The experimental facilities were used for the
processing of 530 kg of salt mixtures in 55 batches
that consisted of 5-,-10-, and 50-b quantities.
Twenty-eight of these batches were materials that
contained BeF,. Included in the total were ‘11
batches of the NoF-KF-LiF-UF, mixture for use
by the Metallurgy Division.

Requests for molten ‘salts and especially for
BeF ,-bearing mixtures have reached a level which
is Beyond the production. capabilities of the
experimental facilities. It is anticipated that the
250-1b-batch production equipment will be operated

at intervals during the next several months to
provide the material required. ;

Four batches totaling 270 kg of LiF-BeF UF,

mixture were prepared during a trial run of the
+ 250-1b-batch - production equipment for two weeks

during ‘December. This operation, on a three.

. shift, five-day-week: basis, was conducted
~~ cooperation with ‘the “Y-12 Industrial Hygiene
~ "Department, and face. ‘masks and complete pro-
‘fective clothing were used by the operating
personnel, Careful monitoring by the industrial
hygienists revealed no significant exposure of the
~ personnel to air-borne beryllium compounds. The
- occurrence of severe dermatitis among the
operators, however, indicated that routine operation

of the equipment under the conditions of this test

PERIOD ENDING JANUARY 31, 1958

was not feasible. It will, apparently, be necessary
to enclose the equipment and to provide an
improved ventilation system before its continued
use can be adjudged safe in all practicable
circumstances.

Analyses indicated only 3 to 4 wt % uranium in
the final product, rather than the 6.4 wt % charged
to the reactor. Examination of the residue in the
reactor showed high concentrations of uranium as
UO,. It is apparent that contact between HF
and the liquid in the large reactor was insufficient
to remove H,O and BeO from the mixture and that
precipitation of UO, by the reaction

UF, + 2Be0 —> UO, + 2BeF,

resulted. Experiments cre under way to develop
a modified technique for preparing satisfactory
material with this equipment. Most of the available
material can be used in experiments for which the
precise compositions requested are not essential.

Preparation of Material for In«File Loop
F. A. Doss
A single batch was prepared that totaled about

300 g of LiF-BeF ,-UF mixture in which Li7 and
U?35 were used. The solvent mixture of Li’F

and BeF, was purified in Building 9928 at the
Y-12 Plant. When analyses of specimens from
this preparation had indicated its purity to be
satisfactory, the material, in its original con-
tainer, was taken to Building 9212 at the Y-12
Plant where the U235F was added and the final

_ purification was accomplished. Chemical analyses
- made by Y-12 and ORNL laboratories were in good
agreement as to composition of the melt for

accountability purposes. ~The material has,

- accordingly, been transferred to the requestor (see
Chap. 2.2 of this report).

Transfer and Service Operations
“F. A. Doss

Fifty-five filling and draining operations were

. performed during the quarter. Requests for such

services declined to a low of 12 during December
and then increased to 25 during January. About

640 kg of salt and about 300 kg of alkali metals

were transferred in these operations.
