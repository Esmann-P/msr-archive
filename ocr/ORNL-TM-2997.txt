EXPERIMENTAL DYNAMIC ANALYSIS OF THE MSRE WITH 233y FUEL

R. C. Steffy, Jr. WASTER

ABSTRACT

Tests were performed on the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment to deter-
mine the system time response to step changes in reactivity, the neutron-
flux-to-reactivity frequency response, and the outlet-temperature-to-
bower frequency response. The results of each of these were found to agree
favorably with theoretical predictions.

The time response tests were performed with the reactor operating
at 1, 5, and 8 MW and substantiated the theoretical predictions that fol-
lowing a reactivity perturbation the system would return to its original
power level more rapidly at higher power levels than at lower power levels
and was load-following at all significant power levels. A noisy flux sig-
nal (caused by circulating voids) hampered detailed comparison of the
experimental results and theoretical predictions.

Neutron flux-to-reactivity frequency-response measurements were per-
formed using periodic, pseudorandom binary and ternary sequences. This.
type of test effectively prevented much of the random noise contamination
of the neutron flux from entering the final analyses and gave results
which contained little scatter. The results were in good agreement with
the theoretical predictions and verified that for the MSRE, the degree of
stability increases with power level.

Outlet-temperature-to-power frequency-response measurements were com-
pared with similar measurements made during operation with the 235U fuel
and verified that the basic thermal properties of the reactor system were
essentially the same as expected.

R. C. Steffy, Jr.

INTRODUCTION

Several reports and articles (References 1 - 6) relating either to
the theoretical or actual (or both) dynamic response of the Molten Salt
Reactor Experiment have been published, However, none of these has re-
ported in a concise form the dynamic response of the U-233 fueled MSRE.
Reference 4 contains much of the freguency-response information reported
herein, but it is presented in a lengthy context which is primarily con-
cerned with comparing testing signals and techniques. The purpose of
this report is to give a brief description of the observed dynamic re-
sponse of the U-233 fueled MSRE, compare it with the theoretical and sug-
gest possible reasons for differences when applicable, but to eschew any

lengthy description of the testing techniques.

TRANSIENT RESPONSE

A common method of describing the dynamic response of a stable sys-
tem is to display the system response to a step change in an input vari-
able. For a nuclear reactor, reactivity is usually the perturbed para-
meter, This type description (i.e. description in the time domain) has
the advantage of an intuitive appeal to people since we deal directly
with time in day-to-day living. However, analysis of a system response
in the time domain does have some disadvantages. Notably, if the system
output of interest is contaminated with a large noise component, the part
of the output resulting from a step input may be undiscernible from the
part caused by the noise. The reason for making this point 1s the large
difference in the neutron noise level between the ©7°U fuel loading and
253) fuel loading of the MSRE. (The increase in noise level was due to
a concomitant increase in circulating void fraction and was not an in-

trinsic function of the fissile isotope.) An example of the uncontrolled
neutron flux during high-power operation for each fuel is shown in Fig. 1,
and the relationship between the flux noise and void fraction is readily
observable. The vold fraction estimates which are labeled on Fig. 1 were
achieved by varying the fuel pump speed; however, the fuel pump was
operated at full speed (~ 1180 rpm) for all of the dynamics tests reported
here.

During the initial approach to power with the ©°7U fuel, time re-
sponses of the neutron flux to a step change in reactivity were recorded
and are shown in Figures 2, 3, and 4 for the reactor at 1, 5, and 8 ww,
respectively. Also shown in these figures are the theoretical predictions
for step reactivity changes of the same magnitudes, The theoretical cal-
culations were performed using the mathematical model and method described
in Reference 2. The noisy flux signal hinders a comparison of the finer
detail of the theoretical and experimental curves, but the noise was low
enough that some features may be compared. In general, the theoretical
and the experimental curves are in good agreement.

For the 1-MW case (Figure 2), the initial flux peak was slightly
nigher thar the theory predicted, then it oscillated below the initial
level and later increased again with a second peak occurring after about
360 sec, The theoretical curves agree that the change in power should
have returned to a positive indication at this time but indicate that it
should not have been as large in magnitude as the observed behavior. The
extent to which noise contamination forced the positive indication is not
KOGWN .

The noise contamination in the 5-MW case (Fig. 3) makes it diffi-

cult to compare directly the experimental and theoretical results. They

machine than the other two plots. This accounts for the difference in
general appearance of the plots.

are in general agreement, but detailed comparison would be guess-work.
The swells and rolls that occur after about 150 sec are almost surely not
directly related tc the original reactivity input since the system set-
tling time at 5 MW is sbout 150 sec,

For the reactor operating at 8 MW, the flux response to a reactivity
step of 0.02L48% &k/k is shown in Figure L. The maximum power level was
reached during the first second after the reactivity input. This rapid
increase was accompanied by a rapid increase in fuel temperature in the
core, which, coupled with the negative temperature coefficient of reac-
tivity, more than counter-balanced the step reactivity input, so the power
level began to decrease. The temperature of the salt entering the core
was constant during this interval, and when the power had decreased enough
for the reactivity associated with the increased nuclear average tempera-
ture to just cancel the step reactivity input, the power leveled for a
brief time (from ~ 6 to ~ 17 sec after the reactivity input). About 17 sec
after the reactivity increase, the hot fluid generated in the initial
power increase completed its circuit of the loop external to the cere, and
the negative temperature coefficient of the salt again reduced the reac-
tivity so that the power level started down again. At large times the
reactor power returned to its initial level, and the step reactivity in-
put was counter-balanced by an increase in the nuclear average temperature
in the core. Fer the 5-MW case, a short plateau was probably present
also, but the noisy signal obscured its presence. At lower powers, how-
ever, the slower system response prevented the reactor from reaching the
peak of its first oscillaticn befcre the fuel completed one circuit of
the external fuel loop. The plateau therefore did not appear in the 1-MW
case.

An important characteristic of the MSRE dynamic response was that as
the power decreased the reactor became both more sluggish (slower respond-
ing) and more oscillatory; that is, at low powers the time required for
oscillations to die out was much larger than at higher powers, and the

fractional amplitude of the oscillations (A power /power) was larger.

FREQUENCY RESPCNSE
Neutron Flux to Reactivity

Most of the effort in experimentally determining the dynamic response
of the MSRE was expended in determining the neutron-flux-to-reactivity
frequency response. One advantage of working in the frequency domain is
that a periodic waveform may be continuously imposed on a system input
(e.g. reactivity, through control rod movement) until several periods of
data have been collected. All of the signal power of a perlodic signal
is concentrated at harmonic frequencies, and subsequent analysis at a
harmonic frequency very efficiently eliminates most of the noise contami-
nation which is usually dispersed over a wide frequency band. There are
cther advantages to working in the frequency domain, but the more noisy
flux signal with the “337 fuel loading makes this a salient advantage.
Several step and pulse tests (aperiodic tests) were also attempted but
these do rot have the signal energy concentrated at particular frequencies
and the system noise was large enough that the results contained too much

scatter to he useful.

Testing Procedure
The periodic signals used in the frequency-response tests were either

pseudorandom binary or pseudorandom ternary sequences.? These are par-
ticular series of square wave pulses that were chosen because they evenly
distributed the signal power at the harmonic frequencies over a wide fre-
quency range, which permitted determination cf the frequency response
over a wide spectrum with only one test. The frequency range over which
we obtained frequency-response results was from about 0.005 to 0.8 rad /sec.
The lower limit was set by the length of one period of the test pattern
and the high-frequency limit was determined by the time width of the
square wave pulse of shortest duration which the standard equipment would
adequately reproduce. The shortest basic pulse width used in these tests
was 3.0 sec. The frequency range covered by these tests was essentially

the range cover which thermal feedback effects are important.
13

The on-line computer, a Bunker-Ramo 3ko, was programmed to generate
the sequences by opening and closing a set of relays. Voltage was fed
through the relays from an analog computer (Electronic Associates, Inc.,
Model TR-10). This voltage was used to determine the movement of the con-
trol rods, which were forced either to follow the pseudorandom test pat-
tern themselves or to cause the flux to follow the test pattern. The
control~-rod position and the neutron flux were digitized and recorded
every 0.25 sec on magnetic tape. The data were retrieved from the tape
and stored on punched cards which could then be processed with the anal-

ysis programs to yield the frequency-response information.

Analysis Programs
Before discussing each of the programs used to analyze the data, it

is pertinent to note that in some instances the different analysis pro-
grams ylelded markedly different results when applied to the same data.
It is beyond the intent of this report to delve into the possible theo-
retical explanations, but the interested reader may consult Reference ly
for a more complete treatise on the subject.

FOURCO.® This code directly Fourier transformed the time
records, The transformed output (flux) was then divided by the trans-
formed input (rod position) to give the frequency response. This analysis
was usually performed on the full data record, which would contain several
periods of the same waveform, but occasionally was performed on individual
periods of data with the several resulting answers then ensemble averaged.
This latter method is denoted FOURCO ENSEMBLE on the figures.

CPsD. 2» 6 This analysis method utilized a digital simulaticn of
an analog filtering technique for obtaining cross-power spectral density,
CPSD, functions. This code calculated the power spectrum of the input
signal and the cross-power spectrum of the input and output signals and
divided the cross-power spectrum by the input power spectrum to obtain
the frequency response at each frequency of analysis. The key feature of
this code is an adjustable filter width about the analysis frequency.

CABS.7 The third calculational procedure was more involved,

The auto-correlation functions of the input and output signals were calcu-

lated and the cross-correlation function of the signals was calculated.
1h

These were then Fcurier transformed to obtain the input, output, and
cross-power spectra. The input Power-spectrum was then divided into the

crecss-power spectrum to obtain the frequency response.

Discussion

With the fuel stationary, the frequency response of the zero-power
MSRE was essentially the same as that of any stationary-fuel, zero-power,
£33y-fueled reactor. The measured frequency response with the fuel not
circulating is shown in Figure 5. The magnitude ratio, &n/N, - 8k, is
seen to be in general agreement with the theory, but the phase angle is
rot in particularly good agreement. At the higher frequencies for tests
at all power levels, the magnitude ratio and the phase angle were lower
than the theoretical. This is thought to have been caused by the control
rod not adequately following the test pattern yet giving the indication
that it was. The indicators, which are physically located with the drive
assembly, accurately display the action of the rod-drive motors; however,
the flexibility of the control rod makes it doubtful that the tip of the
red, which is about 17 ft from the drive assembly, reproduces the high
frequency component of the rod-drive movement.

The results of a typical zero-power test with the fuel circulating
are shown in Figure €. The shape of the magnitude ratio curve is in ex-
cellent agreement with the theoretical curve, but the results have been
normalized by multiplying each experimental value by 1.75. The phase
angle data was in better agreement with the theoretical predictions than
was the case for the non-circulating data, but there is scatter in the
results,

The need to normalize some results and not to normalize others is
2150 considered to be caused by poor contrel rod indication.® The nor-
malization was not power dependent since some data did and some did not
need normalization at each power level, and the normalization factors,
when they were required, were different for different tests.

As we mentioned in the introduction, several different testing tech-

niques were used in obtaining the experimental results. An example of

results? obtained using a technique. that was unsatisfactory on the MSRE
is shown in Figure 7. The results do not disprove the theoretical pre-
dictions, but they do little toward verifying them either. Certainly,
the results would have done little toward describing the reactor's re-
sponse if the theoretical response were unknown, These data are shown
primarily to display the system response at low, but significant, power.
4A satisfactory testing technique for this reactor was not found until
after the preliminary tests were completed, and it was not convenient to
return to 1 MW to perform further tests. However, the good agreement be-
tween the experimental results and the thecretical predictions at both
higher and lower powers almost insures that the theoretical curve is
very close to the actual response, hence the 1-MW theoretical curve may
be taken as the actual response, In addition, this figure illustrates
the importance of the testing technique which accounts for the difference
in appearance of the results in Figure 7 and those in Figures 8 and 9.
The scatter in the results shown in Figure 7 is due to inaccuracies in
the indicated control-rod position which were accentuated by the testing
technique.

Typical results from tests which employed the most satisfactory
testing technique are shown in Figures 8 and 9 for the reactor at 5 and
8 MW, respectively. The results are in excellent agreement with the theo-
retical curves except for the slight discrepancy at the higher frequencies.
The dip in the magnitude-ratio curves at ~ 0,25 rad/sec (corresponding to
a loop transient time of ~ 25 sec) results from temperature feedback from
the external loop. During a periodic reactivity perturbation at a fre-

quency of about .25 rad /sec, the fuel in the core during one cycle returned

 

"This was the technique in which the neutron flux was forced to follow
to follow the test pattern. It was necessary for the control rod to move
almost continually during this type test and errors in the indicated control-
rod position caused the unsatisfactory results. The technique is basically
sound and could be well utilized on a system with favorable hardware,

he technique that gave the most satisfactory results was one in
which the control-rod position was forced to follow the test pattern. The
rod moved to a new position and then remained stationary for several seconds
until a different pulse was needed, This minimized control-rod movement
and the associated errors,

to the core one period later and, because of the negative temperature coef-
ficient of reactivity, produced a reactivity feedback effect that partially
canceled the external perturbation. The dip is obviously present in the
experimental results as well as in the theoretical curves; however, the
dip in the experimental data is not as pronounced as the theory predicts,
Since the magnitude of the dip has been shown? to be a function of the
amount of salt mixing which occurs as the fuel circulates around the loop,
this difference between the experimental and theoretical implies that not
enough mixing was assumed in the theoretical model, Additional work with
the theoretical model has shown that if the salt transport in the piping
is represented by a series of 2-sec first-order lags (well-stirred tanks
with mean holdup times of 2 sec) rather than the pure delays that were
assumed in the earlier work, the dip in the experimental and theoretical
responses are in good agreement.

Below about 0.5 rad/sec, the magnitude ratio decreases as the power
is increased. This substantiates the observation drawn from the time
response plots; the degree of stability for the MSRE increases with power
level. The lower magnitude ratic at the higher power levels over the
frequency range in which thermal effects are important says, in effect,
that for the same change in reactivity the fractional power (A power /powver)
change will be less at higher power,

The frequency-response curves shown in this document display the
MSRE 's frequency response at several power levels. Of course, several
tests were performed at several different power levels, but in order to
keep the presentation as straightforward as possible, we chose To show
the results from representative tests. Table 1 summarizes the freguency-
response tests performed with the #33 fuel loading and indicates the
scope of the testing program which included 28 different tests of approxi-
mately one-hour duration each. Other experimental results for the 3%
fuel loading are given in References 4 and 5. Complete results of theo-
retical dynamic analyses are given in References 2, 5, and 6. Note that
some tests were performed shortly after the start of operation with 2°U
fuel, and others were performed near the end of operation with 2335 fuel,
There were no indications that the response of the reactor had changed with

operating time,

Qutlet Temperature to Power

During the neutron-flux-to-reactivity frequency-response tests which
were conducted at significant power levels, the response of a thermocouple
(TE-100~1A) on the outlet pipe was also recorded. The data records then
included power (or more specifically, neutron flux) and outlet temperature
during a time in which the power was varied in a periodic waveform. Hence,
the outlet-temperature~to-power frequency response could be determined at

the same harmonic frequencies as the neutron-flux-to-reactivity frequency
23

response. The results of this determination could then be compared with
the results of theoretical predictions.®

The outlet-temperature-to-power frequency-response results from a
test conducted during operation with £2°U fuel as well as two tests per-
formed during operation with #32U fuel are shown in Figure 10. The experi-
mental results of all three tests are essentially the same. This should
be expected since the temperature response to a given change in power is
a function of the thermal properties of the system, and these were changed
very little with the change in fissionable material,

Three theoretical magnitude ratio plots are also shown in Figure 10.
Curve 1 is the as-calculated curve and curves 2 and 3 are this same curve
multiplied by 0.5 and 0.1, respectively. Normalization of the theoretical
by multiplying by 0.5 forces agreement with the experimental results at
low frequencies and multiplying by 0.1 forces agreement at high frequencies.
The reason for the discrepancies between the experimental and theoretical
have not been explained leaving this as an area open for more analysis. It
is of interest to note that in some experimental work!® performed by
S. J. Ball and T. W. Kerlin in which they attempted to determine the re-
sponse of outlet-temperature-to-inlet-temperature perturbations, they too
found a larger degree of attenuation than had been theoretically predicted.

The phase angle plots shown in Figure 10 are in good agreement if
the theoretical thermocouple response to a power perturbation is delayed
by 0.7 sec more than was assumed in the original calculation. (A pure
delay gives a phase shift that changes linearly with frequency.) The
theoretical response of the thermocouple was represented by a l-sec pure
delay plus a 5-sec first-order lag. This was based on calculations per-
formed by 8. J. Ball. This represents a good estimate, but could be
in error by 0.7 sec for this particular thermocouple depending on its
particular response characteristics and physical contact with the pipe.
Ancther possible source of error is the estimate of the location of the
thermocouple on the pipe.

The experimentally-measured outlet-temperature-to-power frequency
response verified that the basic thermal properties of the MSRE were es-

sentially unchanged by the change in fuel loading. The disagreement

the circulating system.
CONCIUSION

The dynamic response of the 23FJ-fueled MSEE was analyzed by three
different methods, each of which had deficiencies but each of which added
information. The transient response of the neutron flux to a step change
in reactivity at various power levels verified that the general response
of the system was as anticipated, but the noisy flux signal made detailed
comparison of the theoretical and experimental results difficult. The
shape of the experimentally-determined neutron flux-to-reactivity fre-
guency-response curves was in excellent agreement with the theoretical
curves over most of the frequency range which was realizable with the in-
stalled hardware. There were problems associated with finding a test
method which would give good results, and erroneous control rod position
indications necessitated normalization of some experimental results. The
outlet temperature-to-power frequency-response determination did not agree
well with theory but did show that the basic thermal properties of the
MSRE were essentially unchanged by the change from 2357 to £73 fuel.

At high powers, the MSRE is a highly damped system. It returns to
its original power level rapidly with no undershoot or wallowing. At
low power levels, the uncontrolled reactor tends to be sluggish and slow
in returning to its original power level. With the reactor at 1 MW, it
was observed that over L400 sec was required for the flux level to stabi-
lize after a step change in reactivity. In summary, the MSRE was stable

at all power levels and the stability increased with power as predicted.
