summary

This report deals with a rather exotic "paper reactor” in which
the fuel is in the form of molten chlorides.

(a) Fast breeder reactor with a mixed fuel cycle of thorium/
uranium-233 and uranium 238/plutonium in which all of
the plutonium can be burned <n 4{fu and in which a dena-
tured mixture of uranium-233 and uranium-238 is used to
supply further reactors. The breeding ratio is relatively
high, 1.53 and the specific power is 0.75 GW(th)/m’ of
core.

(b) Fast breeder reactor with two and three zones (internal
fertile zone, intermediate fuel zone, external fertile
zone) with an extremely high breeding ratio of 1.75 and
a specific power of 1.1 GW(th)/m?® of core.

(c) Extremely high flux reactor for the transmutation of the
fission products: strontium-90 and caesium-13/. The effi-
ciency of transmutation is approximately 15 times greater
than the spontaneous beta decay. This high flux burner
reactor is intended as part of a complex breeder/burner
system.

(d) Internally cooled fast breeder in which the cooling agent
is the molten fertile material, the same as in the blanket
zone. This reactor has a moderate breeding ratio of 1.38,
a specific power of 0.22 CW(th)/m?® of core and very good
inherent safety properties.

All of these reactors have the fuel in the form of molten chlo-
rides: PuCla as fissile, UClg as fertile (if needed) and NaCl

as cdilutent. The fertile material can be 238UCl; as fertile and
NaCl as dilutent. In mixed fuel cycles the 233C15 is also a fis-
sile component with 232ThCl, as the fertile constituent.

In some special cases a hypothetical molten fluoride has been
checked using PuFg3 as the fissile, UF; as the fertile and NaF
and Zr, as the dilutents components. In this case one obtains
a lower but still respectable breeding ratio of 1.5.

In all cases a directly coupled continuously operating reproc-
essing plant is proposed. Some of the technological problems of
reprocessing are discussed. Furthermore the report touches on some
of the difficulties associated with corrosion arising from the
use of these molten media coupled with the irradiation effects
such as structural damage from fast neutrons.
The thermohydraulic studies show that even under the extreme op-
erating conditions of very high neutron fluxes and high specific
power, cooling is possible, in most cases by out-of core cooling
but also in one or two cases cooling internally in the core.

Some molten salt reactor specific safety problems are discussed.
The influence of fast neutrons on the chlorine, forming sulphur
by the (n,p) reaction has been experimentally investigated and

the results are reported briefly.

With this report the work of several years at the Swiss Federal
Institute for Reactor Research is brought to a conclusion.

The history of the development of fission reactor concepts
using molten salt as fuel media is as old and as complex as
the history of the development of nuclear power itself. The
ups and downs have followed those of the parent technology
but the swings have been if anything more violent. In 1976
for example molten salt technology all but died out but then
in 1877 a new attempt at revival was begun this time associa-
ted with the new interest in proliferation-proof systems.

The author of the present paper has a profound belief that
the concept of molten slat reactors coupled with continuous
reprocessing and the associated waste management will become
an important feature of nuclear strategy perhaps in 10 or

20 years time.

In this report the efforts in this field over the last six
years are summarised.
1. MOLTEN SALT REACTORS. GENERAL DESCRIPTION

 

1.1 Methods of classification

 

There are many ways of classifying a reactor type. One such pos-
sibility is shown here.

al Method of cooling

b) Flux intensity related also to specific power density

c) Number of zones in the reactor

d) Kind of fissile nuclides and fuel cycles

e) Neutron energy

f) Purpose of the reactor

g) Dilutent for the molten salt
It is clear that such an arbitrary classification is not neces-

sarily internally compatible and not all reactor types fall easily
into the scheme chosen.

1.2 Method of cooling. External: Internal

 

Molten fuel reactors differ from the point of view of the cooling
system. The following are three types of molten fuel reactors:

to the external heat exchanger. In this type of reactor, only fuel
and fertile material are present in the core (no coolant). The
large amount of molten fuel ouside the core does not of course
contribute to the critical mass.

This type of reactor has been discussed for example by Nelson,
(Argonne 1867) and Lane (USA 1370) especially as a high flux ma-
terials testing fast reactor.

In externally cooled fast reactors the loss of a portion of the
delayed neutrons could adversely affect reactor control. Also the
biological shielding outside the core is very expensive. In this
paper most of the reactors discussed are externally cooled.
Internally, direct cooled reactors: here the cooling agent is

pumped directly into the core where, after mixing, the fuel in
the lower part of the core is separated and pumped out of the
core to the heat exchanger. The direct contact of molten fuel
with molten coolant has several particular advantages! very
good heat transfer, no coolant tubes (or cladding), possibility
of transporting fission products.

The disadvantages are unfortunately, also numerous: problems
of mixing and separating the fuel and coolant, corrosion, etc.
This type of reactor has also been studies, e.g. cooled by
molten lead (Long, Harwell and Killingback, Winfrith 1867),
cooled by boiling mercury (Taube, Warsaw 1906) and cooled by
boiling aluminium chloride (Taube, Warsaw 1566). This type of
reactor must be considered as an "extremely exotic type”, and
only some references are given here.

Internally indirectly cooled reactor: here the cooling agent
flows through tubes in the core. Heat is transferred from fuel
to coolant across the tubes. No direct contact between molten
fuel and liquid or gaseous coolant is permitted. These types
have also been studied, in most cases using sodium as a coolant,
(Nelson, Argonne 1967) or molten chlorides of uranium (Taube,

1370). See Fie. 11.

1.3 Intensity of neutron Flux

 

The molten salt reactors discussed here can be used for two more
or less quite different purposes.

- power production and fissile breeding, which is self evident
- neutron production for nuclear transmutation of the long
radionuclides produced in power reactors.
In this report both types have heen considered
- power breeding ractors with a mean power level of approx
3 GW(th) and steam production with cover critical parameters.

- burner reactors with a very high neutron flux particularly in

the internal zone for neutron moderation when the thermal flux

~ -2 =
reaches 3 x 10% n cm ?s71!,

1.4 Number of core zones

 

The division of the reactor into several zones must be consid-
ered from the point of view of neutronics, thermohydraulics
and safety.

The organisation of multiple zones is easier in the case of
molten fuel reactors than for solid fuel reactors. In this re-
port two types are discussed

- with two zones

- with three zones including outer and inner fertile zone,
(see Fig. 1.7).

1.5 Type of Fissile Nuclide. Plutonium: Uranium

 

The fast reactors show excellent neutron properties, not only
for the fuel cycle:

Uranium -238/Plutonium but also
Thorium -232/Uranium-233

Also a mixsd fuel cycle of both types has some spectial advan-
tages. Fig. 1.3 shows the nuclear properties of the fissile nu-
clides.

1.6 Neutron energy: Thermal and Fast

 

The reactors discussed here are all fast reactors. Thermal reac-
tors however have also been extensively and intensively investi-
gated during the 1960's and 19/0's in Oak Ridge National Labora-
tory USA. (Rosenthal at all, 1972

2.7 BREEDER REACTOR WITH PLUTONIUM BURNING IN SITU

 

Aim of this Concept

 

The aim here is to demonstrate the possibility of using a molten
chlorides fast breeder reactor with external cooling as a devine
for consuming all plutonium produced, <n A{tu. At first the re-
actor is fuelled with denatured uranium -233/uranium -238 and
this is changed stepwise to a feed of thorium and depleted or
natural uranium only.

Such a reactor will have the following phases in its fuel cycle
(Table 2.1) See Fig. 2.1

2.1.2 Reactor in the Build-up phase

 

At the start of the cycle the reactor core is fuelled by ura-
nium-233 denatured with uranium 238 (see Fig. 2.1). (Table 2.7)

Table 2.3 gives information concerning

- the method of calculation

- densities of elements in each of the 5 zones
(core, wall, blanket, wall, reflector)

Table 2.4 shows the neutron balance in the core and blanket

Table 2.5 gives the breeding ratio calculated by a microscopic
method of the form:

aR. = (ia, + (v-1)3 _-Yv
micro l+Q T+a T+0

 

- and the macroscopic method by

production rate of fissile nuclide

BR hacer ” rate of destruction of fissile nuclide

 

- and the maximum neutron flux which gives informaticn on the
flux spectrum in the core.

Table 2.6 shows the geometry of this reactor e.g. see Fig.

- radius: 0.955 m

- volume: 3.65 m3

and

- specific power: 0.75 GW(therm)/m?® of core

- total power: 2.8 GCW(therm)
and inventories of fissile and fertile materials.
Table 2.7 gives some information concerning

- the material flux in this type of reactor. (for more see section
2.37.

The data given indicates that in the given geometry the nominal
power and all related values: temperature, temperature gradient,
velocity of circulating fuel, heat exchange etc. are as for the
steady state reactor with only plutonium fuel in the core (see
section 2.1.4).

2.1.3 The Transient Reactor

 

Very shortly after the start up of the reactor, a significant
amount of plutonium has been produced in the core.

The total amount of plutonium chloride, after having been sepa-
rated from the fission products but mixed with the uranium chlo-
ride and sodium chloride is circulated back into the core. The
amount of fresh U-233 required is correspondingly smaller.

The reactor now burns two fissile nuclides, the uranium-233 and
the reprocessed plutonium. The data given below refers to the
case where approximately half of the fissile uranium-233 is re-
placed by plutonium-239 and plutonium-241.

Based on rather simplified assumptions concerning the isotopic
composition of the plutonium it can be shown that the same core
design is capable of burning the mixture of fissile materials
maintaining approximately the same power level.

Tables 2.8, 2.9, 2.10, 2.11 and 2.12 give the equivalent values
previously shown for the build-up phase.

These confirm the suitablility of the core design for both the
build-up phase and the transient phase.

2.7.4 The steady state reactor

 

This reactor phase is in fact the main object of the work covered
in this report, the steady state fast breeder reactor having the
following features.

- all the freshly bred plutonium can be burned in the same re-
actor (the history of the transplutonium elements is neg-
lected here).

- to achieve this 4n s4fu burning of plutonium the reprocess-
ing of the irradiated fuel is limited to the separation of
all or just the most neutron absorbing fission products and
directly coupled to the reactor

- for the next generation of reactors the fuel is produced in
the form of denatured uranium, that is an isotopic mixture
of

10.5% uranium -233 (produced in this breeder)
89.5% uranium -238 (from the mine or depleted uranium stock-
piles)

~ for over 90% of the lifetime of this plant, that is ~30 years,
the reactor burns its own plutonium and produces the uranium
-233 for the next breeder generation. Tables 2.13 to 2.17
give the corresponding data for this reactor phase as before.

2.17.5 Comparison of the three phases

 

In spite of this rather over simplification it seems that the
proposed reactor design is suited for burning:

uranium -233 in th first phase

uranium -233 and plutonium in the second phase
plutonium in the steady state phase.

[see Fig. 2.3)

As a first approximation the timetable of such a reactor will
be as follows

- doubling time aporoximately 4 years (including the out of core
inventory).

- transient period (going from U-233 of plutonium) approximately
2 years.

- steady state period approx 30 years including shutdown periods
for the exchange of the ppre vessel etc. See Table 2.18

It should be emphasised that the era when fusion reactors are
replaced by other energy sources and hence the plutonium burners
are shut-down, has not been dealt with.

Even here it is conceivable that a reactor design could be prorcoas-
ed which only consumes and thus be used in this shutdown phase.
This however has not been calculated.
2.2 Impact of some parameters on the mixed zone two zone fast
breeder

 

In this section some intermediate results are presented concern-
ing the influence of selected parameters in this design, and giv-
ing the breeding capability of a two zone fast breeder reactor.
(Table 2.19)

The influence of mutual displacement.
T(Pu -239) + £(U-233) = 9 x 107% (10°“*atom. cm?)

by five steps from A to E is given in Table 2.20 and Fig. 2.5
and 2.06.

The influence of the thickness of the external blanket, which
contains thorium, on the total breeding ratio and the volume of
the core for a given case of the following concentrations of
fissile nuclides

Pu-239 3.5 x 10°" (10%%atom. cm” 3?)
U-233 10.0 x 107% (10%"atom. cm-?)
is given in Table 2.20.

For the same case the partial BR's and BR total are shown in
Fig. 2.7 and Fig. 2.08

In addition the following 4 reactor designs have been calculated
having the following arrangement

Core Pu-239 1.1 x 10% —> 1.8 x 10" (x10%*atom. cm?)
U-233 3.4 x 107 %— 5.5 x 107" (x10%%atom. cm 3)
-233/Pu-239 = 3.1

Blanket thickness 100 cm.

The data are given in Tab. 2.21. Other results are found in
Fig. 2.3, 2.10 and 2.11.

2.3 Material balance of the state reactor

 

The most important feature of this reactor is the {nn s{fu
consumption of plutonium. The studies show this to be feasable.
Fig. 2.12 gives the resulting material balance for the steady
state reactor.

2.4 Conclusions

The molten chlorides fast breeder is ideally suited to the (n-
s4tu burning of plutonium matching the current requirement for
a "proliferation safe” concept.

3.1 THE THREE ZONE REACTOR

 

3.1.1 Introduction

The reactor discussed now is rather unconventional because of
its three zones (see Fig. 1.2)

1

internal blanket zone

1

fuel zone

- external blanket zone

This concept has been compared with the more conventional type.
Holding most of the parameters the same the breeding gain comes
out about equal. However, one large difference is that although
the total power is the same the specific power changes by more
than one magnitude being higher in the conventional central fuel
zone reactor. Also the mean neutron flux increases from

1.2 x 10'%n cm 2s”! for the non-conventional central blanket zone

to 2 x 10'7n em 2s”! for the conventional central fuel zone.

Since the specific power and intensity of neutron flux is clearly
a major prealem form the point of view of the engineering design
of the reactor (cooling, radiation damage of structural materiel
and fuel), both systems have been studied, that is without a cen-
tral blanket region and with a radius up to 110 cm. The results
are given bzlow for fuel without uranium and with uranium

fuel for both cases: no internal blanket zone and with an inter-
nal blanket zone.
3.1.2 The three zone breeder with thorium/uranium-233

 

The first case is the fast breeder molten salt reactor with
uranium-233 as fissile and thorium-232 as fertile material
with a three region layout.

- internal fertile zone 1, 50, 30, 110 em
- wall 2 cm

.2 A Three zone breeder reactor with a mixed fuel cycle
U-238/Pu-239 plus Th-232/U-233

 

The next step is a study of a mixed fuel cycle in the three zane
tast breeder reactor. This problem has received much attention
and the published papers given in list 0 should be referred to.

A three zone fast breeder reactor with the geometry shown in
table 3.1 has been calculated.

The range of variations covered include

Pu-239 or U-233 in the core
U-238 Th-232 in the blanket

For a given geometry and concentration of ertile and fissile nu-
clides the influence of the fission products, when the concentra-
tions are increased by a factor 10 results in a reduction in the
breeding ratio by 5%. An increase by a factor 10 in proactinium
decreases the breeding ratio by only 2% (Fig. 3.4).

For the three zone reactor calculations have also been made for
mixed fuel cycles. For the fissile materials Pu-239 and U-233
and for fertile materials with U-238 in the core only and Th-232
in the blanket only.

The influence of parameter variations is given in Fig. 3.5.
The following results can be noted:

the breeding ratio increases (under the given conditions) when
- the concentration of U-233 in the core decreases and U-238

increases

- when the internal wall thickness is halved (note this is very
sensitive due to the presence of 15 atom% of molybdenum)

- when the outer fertile radius increases

- when the inner fertile zone radius increases.

3.3 The three zone reactor - uranium-plutonium fuel cycle

 

The reference reactor is described in table 3.5 and 3.6. The
thermal flux in all three zones, the external breeding zone,
the fuel and the internal breeding zone is only 107% of the
total flux and in the external blanket reaches 107% of the to-
tal flux. The total flux has a relatively flat distribution and
even in the fuel region the max. to mean ratio is only about
1.13 (Fig. 3.6 and Fig. 3.7).

The neutron flux is rather hard and the mean neutron energy
(calculated as the mean of the no. of fissions) 1s around

370 keV (see Fig. 3.3). In a typical LMFBR and in a gas cooled
fast breeder this value is 120 keV and 176 keV respectively.

A good illustration of the influence of the most important
papameters on the breeding ratio is given in table 3.7. The
differences between these calculations and the computur ocut-
put is approx 8%.

3.4 The three zone breeder reactor: Very high breeding gain

 

One of the most important factors in achieving a very high breed-
ing ratio is the hardness of the neutron flux. This is strongly
influenced by the fuel composition.

In this case the fuel is postulated to be a mixture of

a PuCls «= b NaCl - ¢ UCL5 where
a = 0.1 - 0.2, b = 0.7 - 0.8, c = 0.1 - 0.2

Unfortunately not all data are available for this system. (see
Fig. 6.9)

The rough calculations on changing the concentration of PuCl, in
the melt of NaCl (Fig. 3.9) shows a rather sharp decrease of
breeding gain (BG) for decreasing plutonium concentration, espe-
cially when the plutonium molar ratio to sodium is lower than
0.25.

In spite of these uncertainties of the PuCls-NaCl-UCls system,
the influence of the U-238 in the fuel has also been calculated.
For a constant PuCls3 concentration with a simplified assumption
for the Nall concentration the results are given in Fig. 2.1C
and 3.11.

Increasing the ratio of uranium to plutonium in the fuel from

0 to 3 causes the total breeding gain to increase from 0.65 to
0.95. This is rather clear and thus the reference reactor con-
cept includes uranium in the fuel in a ratio of 2 : 1 to pluto-
nium.

Such a high breeding gain is a special feeture of this type of
reactor for producing large quantities of fissile material.

Fig. 3.12 and 3.13 give the results of calculation when the ra-
dius of the central fertile zone is varied. Table 3.8 shows the
simplified calculation of central and external fertile zone
brerding ratios.

From these results the following conclusions can be drawn

- increasing the raius of the internal fertile zone up to 110 cm
increases the breeding gain for a given type of fuel. The ef-
fect of wall and fertile material changes are insignificant

- at the same time the specific power decreases dramatically

- increasing the U/Pu ratio from 2 to 3.6 does not influence
the total breeding gain (see Fig. 3.13)

- the FP concentrations play a rather significant role (Fig. 3.14)

The influence of the 40 cm reflector if changed from iron to lead
is not very great as shown in table 3.0

Fission product concentration however plays a very important role.
For a given reactor design and eiven fuel and fertile compositions,
increasing the concentration of fission products (simulated here
with Cs-133 only) from 2x107° to 2x107% (in 109°2%/cm®) decreases tho
breeding gain from 0.65 to 0.38 when the specific power decreases
less than a factor two.

It can be seen that introducing three zones does not result in
any significant increase in the breeding gain (table 3.10).
Therefore the two zone reactor must be preferred for its simpler
layout.

3.5 The two zone fast breeder. Fuel of uranium plutonium
fluorides

 

3.5.1 Introduction

The aim of this section is to give a rough idea of a fast
breeder power reactor having the fuel in form of plutonium
trifluoride in the molten state instead of molten chloride.
(Table 3.11)

The earier suggestions for a reactor of this type came from
A.M. Weinberg.

The first attempts at carrying out calculations on a reactor
of this type were not successful because a fuel was chosen
having a high concentration of light metals, lithium and be-
ryllium.

A very rough attempt by J. Ligou and the author (13972) shows
the possibility for a fast breeder reactor with molten pluto-
nium fluoride where the light metals were eliminated and the
melting point increased.

F. Faugeras (Fautenay aux Roses) claimed that the fluoride of
U-233 and Th-237 can be used for non-thermal reactors.

Some preliminary results for a three zones reactor are given

in a short form in Table 2.12. The neutron flux remains rather
hard (Fig. 2.15).

3.5.2 Arbitrary assumptions and uncertainties

 

The fuel composition has been arbitrarily chosen since the
appropriate data is lacking in the literature. In most cases
the following fuel composition has been used

~ 0
1 Pu / 1.2 NaF (Te1t = fern)
+ 2.4 NaF / 1 Zr Fy (Toit = 510°C)
another alternative would be

The results obtained, in spite of the uncertainties are en-
couraging. The simplified breeding ratio calculation gives a
BR+o+ of 1.51 and the computed value is BRy,t = 1.465 (table
3.137).

Table 3.14a shows that the influence of fission products is
very significant (see also Fig. 3.16). However the change of
structural material of the wall form beryllium to iron has

only a small effect on the breeding ratio and specific power
(table 3.14b and Fig. 3.17).

In the calculations for three zones studies here, increasing
the radius of the internal fertile zone from 60 cm to 80 cm,
that is a volume increase of 2.37 has little effect on the
total breeding ratio in spite of changes in the regional
breeding ratios (table 3.15a and Fig. 3.18).

Altering the small amounts of plutonium in the fertile material
as a result of reprocessing efficiences also has only a small
effect on the breeding ratio and specific power (table 3.15b
and Fig. 3.19).

Qecouse of the good experience of American and French groups
using graphite as a structural material for molten fluordie
thermal breeders, calculations have been made using graphite
for separating walls for fast breeders. Graphite 2 cm thick
as the wall material was chosen.

The results are rather encouraging. The breeding ratio using
graphite is still very high, even slightly higher and the
specific power in the fuel is lower (table 3.106a and Fig. 3.20).

Changing from the complicated design of three zones with fuel
in the intermediate shell, to the "classical” two zone design
having fuel in the central region results in a dramatic in-
crease in specific power to a prohibitive 26 kW.cm™?’ (table
3.1060, Fig. 3.271, table 3.17).

3.6 High Flux Reactor with Fluoride Fuel

 

Can a fluoride fuelled burner, as opposed to a chloride fuelled
reactor be considered as a reactor for transmuting fission pro-
ducts? (See chapter 4, for the high flux transmutation reactor).

In such a reactor a fuel made up of PuF3/5.4 NaF/2.4 ZrF, has
been assumed. The calculations have been carried out for a
larger bruner of 11 GW(th) and the fission products are assumed
to be generated in a total system of 55 GW(th).

The results are not encouraging in spite of the fact that the
neutron 1fux in the target region was 1.05 times higher for

the fluoride fuelled reacotr as opposed to the chloride fuelled
reactor (Table 3.18, Fig. 3.22).

The effective half life of both fission product nuclides was
(in years)

In fluoride In chloride
fuelled fuelled

(reference)
Cs~137 8.57 8.93
Sr-90 1.73 1.83

These "benefits” must be balanced against a specific power which
is twice as high as the reference case. In the fluoride core this
is 19.9 GW.m™? and for the chloride reactor 10.1 GW.m~%. Such a
high specific power is not realisable.

In addition since graphite might be used in place of beryllium
oxide as moderator (possible for a neutronic viewpoint) a signifi-
cant improvement in corrosion problems is obtained. This has been
proved by the excellent experience of Oak Ridge National Lahbora-
tory with one proviso - at ORNL the fuel was LiF - Bef, - ThFg -
UFg.

4. A HIGH FLUX BURNER REACTOR FOR TRANSMUTATION

 

4.17 Need for fission product transmutation

 

4,171.1 Introduction

The problems associated with the management of highly radio-
active fission product waste has been intensively and exten-
sively discussed (Fig. 4.1).

Here only the transmutation of fission products (F.P.) is
dealt with. The recycling of the actinides is not treated.
Transmutation occurs by using neutron irradiation in a fis-
sion reactor.

A short outline of this chapter can be presented in the form
of the following questions

- why, contrary to many assertions, is neutron transmutation
in a fusion reactor not feasable? - this in spite of the
fact that the fusion machine has often been proposed for
this purpose

- why are recent opinions concerning transmutation in fis-
sion reactors rather pessimictic?

- could transmutation in a fission reactor be possible taking
into account the neutron balance in a breeding system?

- which Fission products are candidates for irradiation in a
fission reactor?

- is the rate of transmutation sufficiently high in a fission
reactor?

- in what type of reactor is the transmutation physically
possible?

- what are the limiting parameters for transmutation in a
solid fuelled fission reactor?

- 1s a very high flux fission reactor possible if the fuel is
in the liquid state instead of the solid state?

Comment

In BNWL-1900 it was noted that the calculation (in a moderating
blanket of the CRT) represents a more realistic blanket config-
uration with a neutron wall loading of 10 MW/m? (This is still
a very optimistic value. M.T.].

In this case the following data have been obtained for a therma-
lised neutron flux from a CTR with a 10 MW/m? wall loading. (Tab.

The conclusions of this study are that useful quantities of
Cs-137 could be transmuted under the projected CTR blanket
loading conditions. The reduction in Cs-137 "toxicity" is still
expected to be at most a factor 3 down. In addition a study of
the build-up of fission product nuclel in order to establish
the requirements of periodix chemical processing and associated
costs has not been carried out.

Comment

H.W. Lefevre (appendix to BNWL-1800) makes an interesting
comment on the study of the transmutation of Cs-137 and Sr-30
in CTR: "Everyone knows that a CTR will be "clean". Don't
spoil that illusion. I think that I would worry some about

a CIR loaded with 50 kg of Cs-137".

4.1.2 Why some opinions concerning transmutations in a fis-
sion reactor are rather pessimistic

 

A recent and mest intensive study of the use of a fission re-
actor for the transmutation of fission products has been pub-
lished by Claiborne (1372). He writes:

"The problem fission products cannot be eliminated by any
system of fission power reactors operating in either a stag-
nant or expanding nuclear power economy since the production
rate exceeds the elimination rate by burnout and decay. Only
at equilibrium will the production and removal rates be equal
a condition that is never attained in power reactors. Equilib
rium can be obtained, however, for a system that includes the
stockpile of fission products as part of the system inventory
since the stockpile will grow until its decay rate equals the
net production rate of the system. For the projected nuclear
power economy, however, this will require a very large stock-
pile with its associated potential for release of large quanti-
ties of hazardous radio-lsotopes to the environment. It is this
stockpile that must be greatly reduced or eliminated from the
biosphere. A method suggested by Steinberg et al. is transmuta-
tion in "burner reactors”, which are designed to maximize neu-
tron absorption in separated fission products charged to a
reactor. If sufficient numbers of these burners are used, the
fission products inventory of nuclear power system can then
reach equilibrium and be maintained at an irreducible minimum,
which is the quantity contained in the reactors, the chemical
processing plants, the transportation system, and in some in-
dustrial plants.

-
- 493 -

If the assumption is made that burner reactors are a desirable
adjunct to a nuclear economy, what are the design requirements
and limitations: it is obvious that they must maximize (with
due regard to economics) the ratio of burnout of a particular
fission products to its production rate in fission reactors,
and the neutron flux must be high enough to cause a significant
decrease in its effective half-life. Of the fission types, the
breeder reactor has the most efficient neutron economy and in
principle would make the most efficient burner if all or part
of the fertile material can be replaced by a Sr-Cs mixture
without causing chemical processing problems or too large a
perturbation in the flux spectrum because of the different
characteristics of these fission products. The cost accounting
in such a system would set the value of neutrons absorbed in
the fission product feed at an accounting cost equal to the
value of the fuel bred from those neutrons.

The maximum possible burnout of fission products would occur
when the excess neutrons per fission that would be absorbed

in a fertile material are absorbed instead in the fission pro-
duct feed. The largest possible burnout ratio would then be the
breeding ratio (or conversion ratio for nonbreeders) divided
by the fission product yield. The estimated breeding ratio for
the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR), a thermal breeder, is
1.05 and for the Liquid Metal Fuelled Fast Breeder Reactor
(LMFBR), 1.38. The yield of '*7Cs + %%Sp is 0.12 atom/fission,
but a number of other isotopes of these elements are produced
which would also absorb neutrons. However, if the fission pro-
duct waste is aged two years before separation of the cesium
and strontium, the mixture will essentially be composed of
about 80% '*7Cs + 9p and 20% '*°Cs (which will capture neu-
trons to form '*®Cs that decays with a 13-day halflife conse-
guently the maximum burnout ratio for !'*7Cs + °%Spr will be de-
creased by 20%. This leads to a maximum possible burnout ratio
of about 7 for the MSBR and about 9 for the LMFBR. Unfortunately,
however, the neutron fluxes in these designs are well below
10'%n cm 257! Any modifications of these designs to create
high neutron fluxes will increase the neutron leakage and de-
crease the burnout ratios significantly”. (Claiborne 1072)
Comment

It is not clear why Claiborne claimed that after 2 years ageing

and separation of strontium and caesium the isotope composition
will be

Cs-137
Sr-90

20% Cs-135

80%

From Crouch (1973) the fission products of U-235 have the fol-
lowing composition (2 years ageing) (in at % per fissioned nu-
cleous). (see Table 4.4)

 

Sr-88 (stable) 3.63
Sr-30 (28 years) 4.39
5-133 (stable) 6.57
Cs-134 (2 years) 3.5 (7.08 0.5 from independent yield)
Cs-135 6.20
Cs-137 5.99
Subtotal 30.34

 

The realistic data are unfortunately more than twice those cited
by Claiborne.

The same negative opinions concerning the use of Fission Reactors
for F.P. - transmutation are given by the following authors:

A.S. Kubo (BNWL - 1800):
"Fission products are not conductive to nuclear transforma-
tion as a general solution to long term waste management”.

BNWL - 1900, itself:

"Tn summary it is improbable that transmutation of fission
products in fission reactors could meet any of the technical
feasibility requirements for the production of stable daugh-
ters”.

Claiborne (1972):
"Developing special burner reactors with the required neutron

flux of the order of 10''n em™?s™! is beyond the limits of
current technology”.
4.1.3 Which fission products are suitable candidates for
transmutation and in what quantities?

A simplified breakdown of neutrons and fission products produced
by fission of 1 fissile plutonium atom is given in Fig. 4.4

From this it must be clear that only a very limited amount of
fission products can be irradiated by neutrons of the whole
system to retain a good breeding gain and doubling time - in
other words a s elf sustaining and expanding breeding system.
For further consideration it is postulated that the maximum num-
ber of transmutable nuclides equals T = 0.3.

The proposed system for the transmutation includes two types
of reactor:

- power reactors in the form of fast breeder reactors with a
total power of three to four times that of:

- a high flux burner reactor.

The crucial F.P. nuclides are characterised in table 4.4 to-
gether with others. The data available now makes it possible
to estimate the number of candidates for transmutation in our
breeder/burner system, using the tollowing criteria

- the total amount of all nuclides to be transmuted cannot be
greater than the estimated value of T = 0.30, that is 30 atoms
of F.FP. nuclides for each 100 fissioned nuclides.

- the order of priority taken from this table is given as
Cs > Sr> 1 > Te

- in the first instance no isotopic separation process is
postulated.

Table 4.4 shows the F.P. nuclides selected for transmutation.

4.1.4 In what way could a burner reactor be coupled to a
system of breeders?

 

The aim of the calculations used here is to show

- that given a system containing some breeding power reactors
with a breeding gain of GP

- the fission products from all of these reactors can be tans-
muted in the high flux burner reactor, which includes of
course the fission product transmutation for the burner re-
actor itself.

The calculation of the ratio of breeder power to burner power
is as shown here

T = eb (Y(?%Sr) + v(137Cs) + Y{other F.P.))
Y(°%Sp) = 0.041; Y('®’Cs) = 0.064

GC? = 1.375 (arbitrary)

Freeding gain for the total system with transmutation GF
Ratio of fission to total capture: a = 0.24 (arbitrary)

c= 068 - T/(1+a)

Taking a numerical example with the same values arbitrarily
chosen (including also another fission product with ayield of 0.1)

T= 0.57% (0.041 + 0.064 + 0.1) = 0.40
0.40

cl = 375 - — = 5

G 0.375 TUT 0.0"

which is sufficient for a power system having a slowly increas-
ing capacity with a doubling time of 100 yr. This corresponds
to the near steady state case.

X+Go-1 = (X+1) G6

The correspondence ratio of the power of the breeder reactors
and the burner reactor in this case equals

This means for example for 8 power reactors each of 3 GW(th)
(i.e. a system total of 30 GW(th) can deal with the transmuta-
tion of the fission products chosen here. The electrical cutput
assuming an efficiency of 40% is (3x8 + 1x7)x0.40 = 12 CWle)
(Fig. 4.5).

Th

4.1.F Is the rate of transmutation sufficient?

 

It is clear that the rate of radioactive nuclide removal in a
field of particles is given by

neutron flux required to permit the transmutation rate to match.

Let us assume that the energy production is based on a set of n
burners and nX breeders. At a time t_, (see Fig. 4.5) when it

is decided to stop the use of fission energy production in favour
of other sources the total amount of a selected fission product
present is

 

YP/E

with K =
Y = yield of the selected F.P.
P = power per burner (or breeder) (Watt)
E = energy per fission (Joule)

This amount of F.P. is located only in the burners, therefore

At time t, the nX breeders are shut down and only n burners are
in operation. Later on (time t,_4) the nuclide removal is such
that a re-arrangement is possible and one burner can be stopped,
ist F.P. contents will be loaded in the remaining burners etc.
At the beginning of each time step tp the p burners which are
still working contain the maximum possible amount of F.P.

One could imagine other schemes: for example the rearrangement

The two approaches give similar results except at the end when

For times longer than ty only one burner 1s operated and the
amount of F.P. would decrease from

 

 

We shall postualte that it has no sense to operate this last
burner when the amount of F.P. is only 1.2 times longer than
the asymptotic value which requires a new time interval

The total time ty - t, will be the sum (6) + (7) which corresponds

Further reductions can only be obtained by natural decay (t>t J.

Numerical application: with X = 4,n = 100 which means the economy
was based before t, on 400 breeders, the initial F.P. amount is
reduced 415 times when the last burner is shutdown. Then the re-
quired time is defined by geeltg-tp) = 8.83 (8.76 with the approx
expression). If this time is to be less than say 60 years 2 re-
actor generations) then gpg = 4.7x107°s7! (typ eff = 4.7 years].

Now the problem of the intensity of the neutron flux desired for
transmutation arises. Since the most hazardous F.P. nuclides are
those which apart from their high metabolic activity and high re-
tention in living organismus also have a half life of the same
order as a human life span of 60-70 years we arrive at the fol-
lowing list of hazardous isotopes which are the most important
for transmutation.

4.17.6 In what reactors are the transmutaticons possible?

 

From the point of view of this paper the most important process
is the transmutation of some of these nuclides by neutrons in a
fission reactor. The criteria given in chapter 2 limit the choice
of system. That is

- the number of F.P. nuclei cannot be too large in relation to
the number of fissioned atoms in the burner reactor (reactor
for transmutation) because the latter process also produces
new fission products.

- the fission reactor should be self-sustaining - that is a
breeding system.

- the specific power of the reactor is proportional to the neu-
tron flux. High neutron flux means high specific power which
is controlled by the effectiveness of the core cooling.

- the specific power F and the neutron flux ® are coupled hy
the fission cross section and the concentration of fissile
nuclide (Ng)

For thermal neutrons of 1s approx. 700 barns and for fast neutrons
only 1.8 barns, that is 400 times smaller.

For the given total power and the same specific power the product
Need for the thermal reactor must be approx. 400 times smaller
than for a fast reactor. Since the critical concentration of fis-
sile nuclides in a thermal reactor can only be 10 times smaller
than for a fast reactor then for a given specific power the neu-
tron flux in a fast reactor can be about 40 times higher than that
of a thermal reactor.

The cross section for thermal neutrons for the nuclides considered
here is from 3 to 10 times larger than in a fast flux and this
must be taken into account.

All these factors bring us to the following solution of the prob-
lems under discussion.

- the highest specific power and hence the highest neutron flux
is pogsible if the cooling process is carried out by the fuel
itself and not by a separate cooling agent only.

This directs our interest towards a reactor with molten fuel
in spite of the exotic nature of this solution.

- the high flux reactor must be a fast reactor (small for fast
fission)

- because Oth > Ofggt the thermalisation of the high flux in a

- the first approximation is made for an isotopically pure radio-
nuclide e.g. Cs-137 without Cs-133 (stable) and Cs-135 and also
Sr-30 without Sr-88 (stable).

The discussion then results in:

- transmutation of Cs-137 (and some other nuclides) in a ther-
malised central trap of high flux neutrons:

therm = 5x10'® n cm ?%s7!

- production of a high flux of fast neutrons 5x10'® n em” %s”! and
the high specific power of 15 kW cm”? is achieved by means of

liquid fuel circulating through an external cooler.
- transmutation of other selectred fission products in an external
thermalised zone with a thermal flux of 5x10'° or

110° n om™?%s° 1,

- coupling of one burner - high flux fast burner reactor with a
system of 'normal’ power breeder reactors.

4.1.7 What are the limitations of a solid fuelled reactor?

 

Can the desired specific power of 15 kWem™? be achieved in a solid

fuel reactor? These are the self-evident limits in this case.

- the rate of burning of fissile nuclides is limited due to
depletion of fissile or an increase of F.P. nuclides

- the heat transfer limitation of fuel/clad to coolant

- the temperature and temperature gradients in the fuel and
cladding (melting, mechanical properties)
- 108 -

- the boiling of the coolant
- the limitation of coolant velocity, pumping power, stability.
Now we discuss these limitations in more detail

- the dwell time in a solid fuelled reactor in core for the
fissile nuclides must not be too short.

Conclusion:

especially in the case of a solid fuel reactor

- the limitation of specific power by heat transfer is as follows:

It is evident that this result is not realistic.

The solution of this problem may be the thermalisation of neutrons
in a high flux fast core and the irradiation of Cs-137 in a thermal
central zone.

In such a thermal central zone we postulate (and this must be hased
later on core calculations)

It is also evident that this result is not realistic!

The resulting thermal stress in the cladding wall coupled with the
high flux is prohibitive.

Hiere, the most important problem is the local overheating by the
thermal flux present at the interface of the thermal column and
the solid fuel core. If, in the fast region near to the interface
approx. 20% of the enrgy comes from the thermal neutrons, the fol-
lowing ratio of fluxes must be achieved:

That the thermal flux must be 2000 times lower than the fast, would
seem very difficult to realise.
4.17.8 The liquid-fuelled fast reactor with central thermal zone

 

A much better solution is using a liquid-fuel. The transfer of
the heat generated is done, by pumping and cooling the liquid
fuel out of core.

For a unit cell of 1 cm’, which in this case consists of fuel
only, we can write the following heat-balance.

p = (pec) = w ¢ =; (pec) = heat capacity (Jecm™®ek™ 1)

If we allow in the core a temperature increase of AT/1 nv 2 degecm !

 

This velocity appears to be within the practical limits proposed
for a fuel-velocity of 40 m.s™! for a reactor with 10 kW.cm™3
specific power. This point however has to be seriously investi-
gated, as erosion dus to high velocities is a problem.

For a 7000 MW(th) core with a specific power of 21 kWecm™? the
fuel volume is about 0.330 m?.

The target volume, that is the volume of irradiated (transmuted)
fission products e.g. Cs-137, is postulated as 1.3 m®. The dia-
meter of a spherical core is therefore 146 cm. The temperature
increase of the unit cell of fuel, in one pass through the core,
rquals approximately

T = 3 (degecm™!) « 146 (cm) = 438°C
furl ©

and for a fuel inlet temperature of 5507C we reach an outlet tem-
perature of approx. 388°C.
The idea of a liquid fuel high flux reactor has been discussed
for some years. Lane (1371) for exemple writes about high flux
fas reactors:

"As an alternative some consideration has bzen given at Oak Ridge
to the possibility of using a molten salt reactoras a fast flux
test facility. The primary virtue of this approach includes the
ability to achieve very high power densities and at the same
time sliminate the down time associated with refuelling the re-
actor. A fast spectrum molten salt reactor however requires a
high fissile concentration (i.e. 300 to 500 ¢ 23%°U/litre) in
order to get mean neutron energies in the range of 10 to 50 keV.
Switching from an NaF - UF, salt (on which the energy range

Just mentioned is based) to a chloride-salt reactor would permit
a higher mean energy for the same fuel concentration but would
require the development of a new technology associated with the
use of chlorides. Since the fast flux level is largely defermin-
ed by the power density a flux of the order of 10'® or more cor-
responds to a peak power density in the fuel salt In a range of
5 to 10 MW/litre and to a power level of about 1000 MW(lth). This
means that there will be only 100 to 200 litres in the core:
however the external volume would be about 10000 litres”.

4.2 The Neutron-physical Aspects of the High Flux Reactor

The idea of destroying the beta active long lived radionuclides

Fig. 4.10 gives some of the given transformations which may
occur under a high flux. (Remark: Fig. 4.3 and 4.9 omitted)

In this system the following simple assumptions are made

- the amount of fission products come from both the fast power
reactor breeders and the thermal burner.

- the fuels and materials are continually reprocessed

- the irradiated fission products are continously (or periodi-
cally) separated in order to eliminate the daughter stable
nuclides (e.g. Zr-90 and Zr-91) from the decay and burning
of Sr-80

- the amounts of transmutated nuclides in the steady state (58)
irradiation are calculated by the obvious relationships for
the i-th nuclide.

4.2.7 Neutronic calculations

 

A reference burner reactor concept is shown in Fig. 4.71. The
flux trap is surrounded by a BeO beryllium oxide spectrum con-
vertor, a critical fuel thickness and an outer wall (see Table
4.5 and Table 4.06). Fig. 4.12 shows the calculated flux distri-
bution. The total flux in the fuel is similar to that in the
flux trap (Fig. 4.13)

.3 Moderation requirements

 

To form a thermal neutron flux trap one must naturally use nru-
tron moderating materials. As is well known, light materials can
scatter neutrons past the neutron-absorbing intermediate-ennargy
resonance region. 4H is the most efficient nuclide in this re-
spect but als exhibits appreciable thermal absorption. Deuterium
1D, beryllium Be and arbon ec are usual alternatives. Oxygen 50
is rather heavy though frequently already present in a molecular
combination. Other light nuclides have unacceptable nuclear or
physical limitations.

Considering chemical and physical properties, the logical mate-
rials to be used inside the lux trap are hydroxide and/or deuter-
oxide compounds of the FP. Fig. 4.174A shows that just a small
proportion of H molar fraction has a large deleterious effect

on the Cs-13/ transmutation rate. This is due to the H absorp-
tion cross section. Therefore, Cs00 and Sr(0D), are preferred.

As Sr-80 and €s-137 also have their fair share of resonances it
is advantageous to thermalise the flux before reaching the flux
trap region containing these targets. Therefore a spectrum con-
verter between flux trap and fast fuel is needed. Bearing in
mind the high temperatures to be obtained in this reactor and
possible chemical reactions with molten salt, H-0 and Dy0 are
unacceptable. This leaves Be, BeO and graphite or some variant
therefore for consideration. Be (and DB) compounds, of course,
have also to their advantage a relatively low (n,2n) threshold
(1.67 MeV). Location nect to a fast region can therefore pro-
duce considerable very slow neutrons in the flux trap - which
is a main objective of the burner reactor. Replacement of Be

by C or Mo wall material should therefore lower the FP trans-
mutation rate, and it does. (Table 4.7 Fig 4.148) indicates an
optimum thickness of about 5 cm Be. For the sake of safety and
higher melting temperature, BeO is preferred over Be.

4.72.4 Influence of other parameters

 

The influence of plutonium concentration (Fig. 4.14C) is an im-
portant parameter of this reactor. Increasing the plutonium con-
centration significantly improves the transmutation rate but also
increases the power density above a technically feasable level
(Fig. 4.140). See also Fig. 4.15.

Increasing the reactor power (Fig. 4.16A) from 5 ta 11 GW(th)
improves the transmutation rate. However a power unit above

7 GW(th) seems to be beyond the technological limit even for
the distant future. The reference case has been taken as

7 GW(th).

The use of beryllium (Fig. 4.168 and 4.16C) instead of iron in
the reflector of the core improves the transmutation rate sig-
nificantly. At the same time the power density increases pro-
hibitively (Fig. 4.160). The reference case contains iron in
the reflector.

Molten fuel offers the only way of handling the very high power
densities of 10 GWm-®. In addition the very steep gradient of
fission rate makes a molten fuel core essential since the local
fission density can be one order of magnitude greater than the
mean density. In a solid fuel core the high heat removal rates
would not be achievable.

The use of boron to absorb the thermal neutrons results in a de-
finite decrease in the rate of caesium transmutation (Fig. 4.17).

The large size of the thermal flux trap results in the fuel re-
gion approaching slab geometry with attendant high neutron leak-
age. To better economise on neutrons several possibilities may

be tried

- use of an optimised reflector such as Fe, Ni, Cu or Be to
minimise the critical mass

- use of the outer neutron leakage for breeding
- use of the neutror leakage for additional FP transmutation

To begin with a solid Fe reflector was assumed (Fig. 4.18).

4.3 Thermohydraulic considerations

 

We now examine the thermohydraulic implications (for more detail
see ch. 8).

The crucial parameter here is the core power density. The given
value is high but still near the present state of the art
(Table 4.8).

For comparison, power densities for some high flux reactors.

4.4 Some results

Parametric studies were made as variations around a reference
system which assumed P = 11 GW(th) (X = 2-9, K = 4+2) and Rg =
785 em. The flux trap is surrounded by 5 cm BeO converter, a
critical fuel thickness of 6+6 cm and an outer wall. Fig. 4.18
shows the calculated flux distributions for such a burner re-
achtor. Note that the total flux in the fuel is similar to that
in the flux trap. The calculated fluxes lead to the conclusion
that

(total spectrum, flux trap) = V2<(E=0.0253)

The result indicates the relative effect of X on the ratio R of
the FP transmutation rate Lo FP production rate for the reactor
system. It can be seen that X should be kept as low as possible.
Absolute results will depend on the Cs and Sr densities in the

flux trap. A value of R = 1 was achieved for both FP nuclides
at X = 45, The F.P. atom ratio there was (Cs-137) / (Spr-90) =

5
JAPRCEEIN

Another important problem is the relatively high flux in the outer
zone or leakage from the core.

This flux can be used for two purposes:

1) for transmutation of other fission products which have
rather a high absorption cross section e.g.

th 8

Te-99 o = 22 barns t,, = 2.1 x 10° years
1-129 oth = 28 barns t) = 1.7 x 107 years
In both cases a fiux of 10'* - 10'°n em-ls !

permits a rather effective transmutation rate of

Te-09 x = 7 x 107 °%s7} 3 years

t
V2eff

1-120 Xx = 7 x 10 %g ! years

tt, = 7
V2eff

To still further improve these reactions the use of a beryllium
moderator in the form of a 5 cm wall in the outer region of the
core has been calculated. This gave an improvement in the trans-
mutation rate of Cs-137 in the inner target region but also a
very significant increase of specific power due to the scattering
of the neutron flux in the fuel region.

The possibilities for transmutation of these two long lived fis-
sion products will be descussed further elsewhere.

The neutron flux outside the core may also be used for breeding
in a uranium blanket. The breeding ratio may be higher than 1
but the decrease of the transmutation ratio is critical and
seems to be too low for a burner reactor.

Nevertheless it could be useful to check these possibilities in
more detail using some of the available neutrons for breeding
in an external blanket region.

Table 4.9 summarises the data for the reference case. It can be
shown that the transmutation rates obtained are egual:

The results obtained are significant but rather pessimistic. To
ostimate the "profit" of the transmutation process, the hazard
index (H) must also be taken into account. From Table 4.10 it can
the seen that the total reduction in hazard from both fission pro-
ducts eguals 13.5, which is a better indication.

A.5 Comments on hazard coefficients

 

It 1s perhaps valuable to estimate the usefulness of using the
concept of hazard coefficients in fission product management.
Table 4.10 gives some values for Sr-490 and Cs-137. From this it
can be seen that in a steady state transmutations requiring the
amount of hazardous substances is reduced by a factor ~ 15 in
relation to the steady beta-decay.

The amount of strontium-90, the most hazardous nuclide, in the
high flux burner is about the same as that found in the power
reactors after 3 years of operation.

However the most impressive result comes from considering the
end of the fission power area. Where by compared to storage
(natural decay with a combined half life of 39 years) without
transmutation, the transmutation case shows that the amount of
nuclides remaining will be reduced by a factor of 1000. (Fig.
L,22).

In a high flux transmutation the reduction by a factor 1000

would be achieved with 26 years in the lifetime of one reactor
generation.

4.7 Gecondary processes

 

It must be remembered that the relatively high neutron flux ro-
sults in the irradiation not only of the non-desirable radio-
active nuclides but also the stable fission products, including
the statbile components of the fuel and structural material. A
very short review of these partivular processes is given here.

Conclusions

The system proposed for the transmutation of °°Sr and '?7Cs,
fulfills the following criteria:

1.

The energy halance is positive.

The hazardous waste balance 1s strongly negative. That is,
the amount of hazardous material destroyed greatly exceeds
the amount of freshly produced, e.g. tritium, '°B, and the
activation products of the structural malerial.

The rate of destruction (transmutation) is approximately a:
least one order of magnitude greater than that due to spon-
taneous beta decay.

The period in which a thousand-fuld reduction in the hazard
can be achieved is the same as the lifetime of one reactor,
that is, 20 to 40 yr.

The neutron balance of the system is positive. That is, it
permits breeding to occur alone with the transmutation.

The weakest feature is shown in the relationship between the
probability of catastrophic release to the environment for
the transmutation operation, Pin.gng, to the probability of

a similar event in the case of storage, where it is
desired that

Further optimisations of the system are possible.

The proposed system, a molten-salt fast reactor, while rather
exotic from a technological point of view, is not as far re-
moved from the present state of technology as some other trans-
mutation proposals (e.g. high-flux high-energy accelerators,
controlled thermonuclear reactors) may be.

5. An internally cooled breeder with uranium-plutonium fuel

 

5.17 Design features and objectives

 

In this chapter a further variant of the molten salt breeder is
described.

The core is cooled by a cooling medium circulating in tubes. The
molten fuel is intensively miced. It remains in the core and no
fuel other than that being drawn off for reprocessing is present
outside the core.

The unique feature of this concept is the use of a molten fertile
material as the cooling medium for the core.

Such a dual function for the fertile coolant results in same
unusual properties for this reactor type. The study here is
concerned with a molten chloride breeder reactor. The most im-

portant features are: (see table 5.1)

- thermal power: 2.05 GW - 1.94 GW in core + 0.71 GW in the
blanket

- electrical power: 0.85 GW in the optimum case | = 0.4)

- the fuel and coolant flow concurrently (Fig. 5.1)

- the reprocessing plant is in close proximity to the reactor
("under same roof")

- the fuel in the core, and the coolant is pumped with a velo-
city of 2 and 9 m.s™! respectively.

- structural material: possibly molybdenum along with small
amounts of other metals s.g. Ni, Fe.

The advantages of the proposed reactor are as follows -

- no separate coolant, no "foreign” cooling agent (e.g. sodium,
helium etc.) in the core which results in a more satisfactory
system with improved neutron balance.

- the fuel Inventory is very small due to lack of a separate
cooling system and the small out of core inventory due to
the directly coupled reprocessing plant.

- the fuel contains only plutonium and no uranium which simpli-
fies the processing technology and removes the danger of
uranium trichloride oxidation which also improves the cor-
rosion properties of this medium

= the high velocities of both fuel and coolant, significantly
reduces the temperature gradients in the equilibrium state
and reduces the mass transport mechanisms. These are very
sensitive to temperature gradients and play a large role in
corrosion.

However the diadvantages are numerous:

- the first and most improtant is of course corrosion. The mol-
ten chloride medium especially in neutron and gamma fields,
at high temperatures and velocities with chlorine being vir-
tually freed in the fission process from plutonium chloride
presents a very serious problem which must, and probably could
be solved.

- the most likely structural material seems to be molybdenum
alloy which among other thing gives rise to parasitic absorp-
tion of neutrons.

- the fuel is circulated by a pump which must be located in or
close to the core which increases the corrosion problems.

- the high fuel and collant velocities result in high pumping
costs and could cause severe erosion.

5.3 Neutron Physics (cceordine fo Jo Licou, 106.77)

The 2 group transport calculation gives 125 cm (8-18 m?®) far the
critical radius of the core with a hlanket thickness of 25 cm
(30.42 m?®). The detailed neutron balance is given in table 5.3.
The relative fluxes for each group are to be found in table 1.3
tor core centre and core boundary. The corresponding one group
cross sections are given in table 5.4. In Fig. 5.2 the neutron
speetra (flux per lethargy unit) are compared to that of the fast
critical facility ZPR - 3 - 48. This last spectrum is slightly
harder but the spectrum of the molten chlorides fast breeder com-
pares facourably with that of a power LMFBR. From table 5.3 one
can deduce the following parameters

kK, = 1.385

Breeding ratio Bro ore - 0.716
MR lanket u.670
BRy Stal = 1.386

For the given core (125 om radius) the blanket thickness was variod

betwern 75 cm and 115 em. Fig. 5.4 shows the variation of bronding
ratios obtained from the new transport calculations. The reactivity
and the core breeding ratio remain practically constant in this
rankge making the adjustment of the core volume unnecessary.

Adove 100 cm improvement of the breeding ratio by increasing the
blanket thickness gives a poor return. For example to increase

the breeding ratio from 1.40 to 1.45 requires a thickness increase
of “0 cm or a blanket volume increase of 32%.

On the other hand the reactivity depends on the core radius.
Fig. 5.5 shows the variation of reactivity with increasing
core size. Such acurve is very useful when it is required to
translate the cost in reactivity of a supplementary parasitic
absorbtion into an increase in core volume (or plutonium in-
ventory). The transport calculations used in Fig. 5.5 could
not be used to obtain the corresponding variations in breeding
ratio, rather they have been calculated from the information
in table 5.3. (assuming small core volume variation < 10% and
no important changes in spectral.

This gives

1) BRL Jt a1 - 1.386 - 2.45 6k (breeding in core unchanged)

The effects of modifying the core composition can be evaluated
by the same method. This 1s arranged to avoid altering the
properties of the coolant and fuel by varying the coolant tube
diameter. The reactivity is very sensitive to this parameter.

It can be seen that the penalty on the total breeding ratio for
the same 8K is only slightly greater while the penalty on the

increase of plutonium inventory is five times less. Therefore a
reduction in the diameter of the coolant tubes is preferable to
an increase in coolant diameter, provided of course that an in-
crease in coolant velocity is admissible. This last assumption

is implicit in these calculations since the coolant density was

kept constant,

In the whole system the chlorine absorption represents 5.38%.
We have seen that the GGC-3 values are different from the more
up to date ones (ENDF/B-III). On the basis of these new cross
sections given in Fig. 5.3 (curve 6) and assuming that the re-
ference spectrum is unchanged, a computation of the one group
corss sections gives 8.40 mh instead of 6.33 mb in the core,
and 9.117 mh instead of 8.83 mb in the blanket. In this last re-
gion the spectrum is softer and the increase of cross sections
in the energy range (E nv 0.06 MeV) is almost compensated for by
the decrease at the lower energies (10 keV - 0.6 MeV].

The total absorbtion by chlorine for the whole system is R.57%
instead of 5.38% giving a loss of reactivity of 1.2%. This loss
could be replaced by a 1.3% increase in Pu inventory if a very
small decrease (0.65%) of the conlant tube diameter is accepted.
Otherwise by changing only the core radius a greater increase

of Pu inventory (10%) is required (Fig. 5.5)
Even with this latest data the problem of parasitic capture in
the chlorine is not dramatic and there is no reason to believe
that there is no need to enrich the chlorine *’Cl. This is con-
sistent with the conclusions of Nelson. Fig. 5.3 clearly shows
the importance of the energy distribution (spectrum corresponds
to the chlorine cross section minimum (65% of neutrons are in

an energy range where ogc] < 5 mb). This fact was not perhaps re-
copnised 15 years ago when fine spectrum calculations were not
possible. This could explain the pessimistic conclusions of
several eminent physicists,

For the molbydenum alloy chosen (20% Mol) the reactivity penalty
(2%) is quite acceptable. However the cost could rapidly become
prohibitive if the volume of the structural material and/or the
molybdenum content should increase for design reasons. In the
context of mure detailed design studies this point may become
more important than the definition of the proper chlorine cross-
sections. It does however seem likely that the molybdenum cross
sections used in GGC-3 were overestimated.

In the simplified calculations, no core vessel was allowed for
at the core/blanket boundary but all the required information

is available - fluxes, one group cross sections etc. (Table 547.
Using the same alloy for the vessel (20% Mo) the one group ma-
croscopic absorbtion corss section is 2.56 x 10 *em™! giving a
loss of reactivity:

where e is vessel

For 19 mm thickness a value of 1.37% is obtained for loss of
reactivity which would have to be compensated for by an increase
of core volume of about 10% i.e. about 9 m® instead of 8.18 m’.

A better solution would be an increase in the plutonium inventory
of about 2.1% in the reference core (loss in breeding ratio

1.386 ~ 1.350).

Transport calculations (GGC-3 + SHADOK) have been made for dif-
ferent coolant fuel densitites, different temperatures (in this
case with the density constant to determine only the Doppler
effect). The reactivity changes with respect ot the reference

care are given in table 5.5.

The partial changes in ke or leakage are only approximate but the
total reactivity changes are evaluated directly and are therefore
more precise.

The Doppler effect in the fuel is quite negligible due to com-
pensation between the capture and fission processes.

The effect of full loss of coolant is large and positive but
considerably lower than might be expected from crude calculations
(ke changes in the reference spectrum).

coefficients.

In the second term the part played by the Doppler coefficient
(4.8 x 107%) is quite negligible. For + 100°C in the fuel the
loss of reactivity is - 3.8% which is very important from the
safety point of view. Compared to any kind of power reactor
(even the BWR) the advantage of this kind of reactor is quite
evident.

For the Nelson (1867) value of the thermal expansion -3.107"%
instead of -6.3 x 107" one gets - 1.8% which is very close to
the Nelson result -1.5%.

If we postulate an accident condition and assume that the same
increase of coolant temperature immediately follows the fuel
temperature rise, the overall change in reactivity is defined
by:

2) T - 2.51 x 1072647

This important isothermal and pessimistic coefficient is still
negative. Nevertheless during a detailed study of this reactor
concept it would be necessary to check the values of the ther-
mal expansion coefficient for fuel and coolant more carefully.
The relative value of the coolant term which is positive might
prove to be too high if the differences between fuel and coolant
became too marked. This problem did not arise with the present
data.

where the space function is called the "fundamental mode” (solu-

in spherical geometry). The critical buckling B? is obtained from
homogeneous calculations based only on the cross section data of
the core, (E) is the asymptotic spectrum which is space indepen-
dent far from the core boundary. For the same 22 energy groups
one gets: B? = 4.08 x 107" ecm™?. Using this value a good fit of
the "exact fluxes” have been obtained from the complete trans-

port calculations (Fig. 5.6). The asympototic fluxes cancel for
= 155.5 cm

where Rg is the extrapolated radius. By definition the blanket
saving is given by

§ = R_ - R_ = 30.5 cm
c

where Ro 1s the core critical radius. The blanket saving depends
mainly on the nuclear properties of core and blanket and on
blanket thickness. However for thicknesses greater than 60 cm
this last effect is very weak. Finally the shape and size of the
core have almost no influence on this saving. This parameter,

for this reason co important in reactor physics, will be used in
the next section for the one dimensional cylindrical calculations.

The axial blanket thickness is taken to be equal to the radiol
thickness (95 cm), and the core height as H_, = 200 cm. The criti-
cal radius of this cylindrical core has to be determined. The

two dimensional transport calculations are too expansive (and un-
safe) and only one dimensional calculations have been made, which
is sufficiently accurate. Axial transport calculations are not re-
quired since the balnket saving is known from the spherical geo-
metry calculations. One can therefore assume the following flux
shape.

e

(B%2 = 1.450 x 107" %cm™?)

The computation of core radius and spatial distribution have been
made with the SHADOK code (cylindrical version) by introducing
axial leakage defined by B?. Before that a first approximation

is obtained by introducing the radial buckling a?, that is to

say assuming for the core only, the shype Y¥(r,E) = J (ar)f(E)
where J, is the usual Bessel function. One obtained a? = B? - Rg?
where the critical total buckling is 4.08 x 10°" cm”? which

gives a’ = 2.83 x 107" cm™2 and a = 1.625 x 107% cm™ 2. Then the
extrapolated radius of the cylindrical reactor is

Rg = 2.405 148.0 cm.
a

 

Finally with the previous blanket saving we get a core radius
proper of Rp = 117.5 em. The direct transport calculations with
SHADOK-code gives Rp = 118 cm! This clearly indicates the value
of the blanket saving concept. Nevertheless these transport cal-
culations are still necessary because they give the radial dis-
tribution of fluxes and specific power over the whole system and
more detailed informations. Fig. 5.6 shows some of the radial
distributions of flux and specific power. The energy production
in the blanket is quite small (1.7% of the core power) because
no fissile materials are present (and only fast fissions occur
in ?%%U). In practice it would be higher (say 5%) since the re-
processing process would not be able to remove all the fissile
nuclides produced even with continuous fuel (coolant) reprocessing.

The radial form factor for specific power distribution is, for
this core

Note; it would be possible to improve this coefficient by choice
of different lattices particularly the most reactive at the
peripheral region.

The axial distribution of specific power is given with a good
approximation. If the axial mean value is unity then this dis-
tribution is:

and H, = 200 cm giving

and a, = 0.78 for the axial form factor.

This axial distribution is very close to that used by Nelson.

“he critical volume is higher for cylindrical geometry 8.75 m’
compared to #.18 m?: this increase was expected.

Usually the number of energy groups required for a good defini-
tion of neutron spectrum is at least 12 for fast critical assembly
studies and 22 can be considered desirable. Therefore a 22 group

5.4 Safety Problems, Comments

 

The molten chlorides reactor seems to be a relatively safe system
due to the following rasons

- an extremely high n=gative temperatur coefficient of reactivity,
since during a temperature rise part of the liquid fuel is
pushed out of the core into a non-critical geometry buffer tank.
The dumping of fuel in case of an incident is also possible in
an extremely short time.

- in a more serious incident when the fuel temperature increases
to 1500-17000C (depending on external pressure) the fuel begins
to boil. The vapour bubbles give rise to a new and unique, very
high negative "fuel void effect”

- the leakage of fuel to the coolant is probably not a serious
problem because the coolant is continuously reprocessed.

- the leak of coolant to the fuel for the same reason cannot
cause large problems (provided the leak remains small).

A rahter adverse propzarty of such a molten fuel reactor is the
need to initially heat the sclidified fuel in a non critical
grometry with external power. (e.g. from the electrical grid).
“his problem has been fully overcame in the case of the molten
fluoride thermal reactor (Oak Ridge National Laboratory).

3.2 Corrosion of structural material

 

6.2.1 General criteria

It is clear that one of the most problematic areas in molten salt
rzactor technology is the area of corrosion. Some criteria can be
formulated as follows

- the free energy of chlorides formation for structural materials
must be relatively low, significantly lower than those of pluto-
nium and uranium chlorides but still lower than those of the
main fission products

- the partial pressure of the chlorides formed from the structural
materials must be rather low which corresponds to a relatively
high boiling point for these chlorides (Fig. 6.16)

- the neutron capture cross section for (n,y), (n,p) and n,2n)
must be low (see later)

The structural materials are in principle different for the two
types of corn discussed.

- internally cooled, using tubes plus the effect of the cooling
agent

- externally cooled by pumping the liquid fuel out of the core

These two variants call for different structural materials and
different requirements

From these and other criteria the following choices may be made
- for the internally cooled core tubes: molybdenum

- for the wall of the spherical core, in the case of the
externally cooled reactor: graphite and berrylia.

6.2.2 Molybdenum as structural material

 

The main corrosion processes result from the following mechanisms
(m = metallic phase, s = salt phase, Me = metallic component of
irradiated fuel or coolant)

 

Me C1. > Mo Clo, +

Ym)

For the behaviour of fresh fuel PuCl, in NaCl the most likely
reaction is (T = 1250 kJ)

> Mo Cl, ._y + ~/, Pu

 

= + 450 kJ/mol C1.
The equilibrium constant of this reaction is small and nguals
10°17 so that this reaction is completely unimportant.

In the biiankel zone the most dangerous reaction is connected with
uranium trichlorides (chlorine from the fission of Pull. lb.

 

 

the control of the uCl,/ucl, ratio in the fertile ccolant might
be feasible due to the continuous reprocessing of this material
together with the control of zirconium from the fission products
oxidation state.
An additional problem comes from the fact that molybdenum has
different oxidation states +2, +3, +4, +5 and all of them have
the corresponding chlorides. (see Fig. 6.17)

Futher difficulties arise from the problem of the reactians
between metal chlorides and oxygen and water.

These reactions (for oxidation state +2) could be written in
simplified form

+ Mel + 2HCI

 

Me Cl, + M50

 

Me Cl, Lo, > MeO + C1

The metal oxides are mostly incoluble in molten chlorides which
results in a serious disturbance of the fuel system. From this
point of view the metallic elements could be divided into three
classes (see Fig. 6.12).

- those which are stable with H,0 and O,, that is the chlorides
are more stable than the oxides (e.g. Na, Cs, Bal and partially
Ca.

- those which are not stable with H,0 and 0, and the resulting
product is a mixture of chloride, oxychloride and oxide (e.g.
Pu, U but also Zr, Ti, Al, Fe, Cr, Mn, Mg - this is the most
numerous group of metals).

- those in which chlorides are converted to the most stable oxide
in the presence of H,0 or 0, (e.g. Mo, W) metals of this class
seem to be less numerous than those In the other two classes.

This property causes the rapid elimination of traces of water or
oxygen in the molten chloride salts of Pu and U. It is also well
known that traces of H,0 and 0, have a very big influence of the
corrosion rate. Molybdenum belongs to the last class, the oxide
is much more stable than the chloride (Fig. 6.18)

This means that the traces of exygen or even water will result in
the production of molybdenum oxide. This effect requires consider-
able further study.
h.2.3 The irradiation of molybdenum and iron in a fast high
flux reactor

The high neutron flux irradiation causes physical and chemical
changes in structural materials.

Molybdenum is a mixture of stable isotopes. The most
important by-product of neutron irradiation is the Tc-93 beta-

emitter with ty, = 2.7 x 10° years and belongs to the decay chain
shown here.

The diffusion rate of hydrogen from the molten fuel to the
coolant and blanket (here also util, - NaCl) must also be
mentioned.

Une can assume that this melt containing hydrogen is saturated
so that the porosity of the wall (molybdenum) will play a minor
role. The most important factor is the variation in the mechani-
cal properties of the molybdenum caused by the uptake of hydro-
gen.

The problem of molybdenum corrosion in chlorine containing media
is particularly complicated by the numerous molybdenum chlorides:

From the earlier published data (Chasanov, 1965; Harder et al.,
1968; Taube, 1861) it appears that the problem of the chemical

state (oxidation stete) in this chloride medium for the fission
product element constituent requires further clarification.

From a simple consideration it seems that the freeing of chlorine
from the fissioned plutonium is controlled by the fission preduct
elements with standard free enthalpy of formation up to nv 20 KJ/mol
of chlorine, that is up to molybdenum chloride. The more ’'noble’
metals such as palladium, technetium, ruthenium, rhodium and prob-
ably telldrium and of course noble gases: xecnon, krypton plus
probably iodine and bromine, remain in their elementary state
because of lack of chlorine. Molybdenum as a fission product with
a yield of 18% from 200% all fission products may remain in part
in metallic form. Since molybdenum also plays the role of struc-
tural material the corrosion problems of the metallic molybdenum
or its alloys are strongly linked with the fission product be-
haviour in this medium.

The possible reaction of UCly and PuCly with Matl

resulting in further chlorination of the actinices-trichlorides
to tetrachlorides seems, for PuCly very unlikely (AGPO00K =

- 460 k3/mol C1) but this is not so for UCL.

A rather serious problem arises out of the possible reaction of
oxygen and oxygen containing compounds (e.g. water) with PuCls,
and UCly which results in a precipitation of oxides or oxychlo-
rides. The con“inouns reprocessing may permit some control over
the permissible level of oxygen in the entire system as well as
the continuous gas bubbling system with appropriate chemical re-
ducing agent.

Corrosion of the structural material, being molybdenum is also
strongly influenced by the oxygen containing substances, A pro-
tective layer of molybdenum however, may be used on some steel
materials using electrodeposition or plasma spraying technigues.

Note that all these considerations have been based on standard
free enthalpy: but even a chance in the thermodynamic activity
from = 1 to = 0.001 which means a change in free enthalpy of
14kJ mol™! thus appears insignificant as far as these rough
calculations eo.

6.4 Some comments on reprocessing

 

Breeder reactors as 1s known form part of a breeder system which
includes not only the power reactor but also the reprocessing
plant.

The advantages of molten salt breeder reactors become particularly
apparent when the reprocessing plant is under the same roof as

the power reactor and when chemical separation processes take
place in the high temperature molten salt media in a continuous
cycle. From Fig. 6.2 it can be seen that all fission products
might be classified into 3 classes.

FPA = fission products of alkali and alkali earth but also
rare earth elements which have free enthalpy of chlo-
ride formation greater than those of Puls.

FPS = fission products of seminoble metals with free ent-
halpy of formation smaller than those of Putl,.

FPE = fission products existing in elementary form because

of the low free energy of chloride formation or
negative balance of chlorine.

The separation of plutonium or Uranium form the irradiated fuel
by means of pyrochemical techniques cculd be carried out for
oxample in the following way.

Molten salt, primary phase Fu, £2 (part of FP remains)
Metallic phase {part of FP remains)
Molten salt, secondary phase containing only Pu.

This is the so called metal transport process. The proposed
schematic of separation processes utilizing metal transport is
given in Fic. 6.271 and b.22.

6.5.17 The proposal

In this type of reactor an in-core continuous gas purging of

the molten fuel which can significantly improve the safety in

an in-core accident, is possible.

A mixture of hydrogen-helium gos is continuously bubbled through
the liquid fuel in the core. The mean dwell time of the gas-
bubbles needs to be controlled and the mean transport time of
the molten components to these bubbles must also be controlled
(m.g. if speed-up is desired-intensive mixing, if delay-local
addition of a further gas stream).

The aim of the gas stri ing 1s as follows:
g z

1) to remove the volatile fission products which in the case
of an accident control the environmental hazard. (1-131,
Xe-133, Kr-85 and precursors of Cs-137) and at the same
time for the thermal reactor, removal of the 1-135, precursor
of Xe-135, improves the neutron balance.

2?) to control the production of delayed neutrons since most of
the precursors and nuclides of this group are very volatile,
e.g. + Br-I-isctopes.

3) removal of oxygen and sulphur, continuously (see Chapter 7)
4) (n s4tu control of corrosion problems on structural materials

For the sake of a first approximation a gas flux of 30 cm?® per
sec. (normal state) of H»/He is arbitrarily assumed. At 20 bar
pressure and with a dwelling time in core of 20 seconds, the gas
bubbles will only occupy a fraction of the core equal to 107°

of its volume and have little influence of the criticality, (but
the collapsing of bubbles results in a positive criticality
coefficient).

The system proposed for continuous removal of the volatile fission
product from the core itself has a retention time of some hundreds
of seconds only. Fach reprocessing mechanism which operates out

of core is limited by the amount of molten fuel being pumped from
the core to the reprocessing plant. This amount, due to the high
capital cost of the fuel and high operation costs cannot be grea-
ter than that which gives a fuel in-core dwell time of about one
week. Even with a 1 day dwell time, that is, if after one day the
fuel goes through the reprocessing plant, no acceptable solution
to the 1-131 problem is obtained since the activity of this nuclide
is only diminished by one order of magnitude. Only

a direct in-core removal gives the dwell time in core as low as
some hundreds of seconds.
6.5.2 Delayed neutron emitters

 

The principal question arise cut of the fact that some of the
short lived iodine and bromine (perhaps also arsenic, tellurium)
lsotopes are the precursors of the delayed neutrons.

G 0.216 3.5

As other possible nuclides the following can be considered +
As-85; Kr-92, -93; Rb-92, -94; Sr-97, -88; Te-136, -137;
Cs-142, -143. The removal of these delayed-neutron precursors
from the core reduces the value of RB, which is lower for Pu-238
than U-235. Thus we have a problem of reaching a compromise
between an as rapid as possible removal of the hazardous 1-131,
and as long a dwell time in the core for the delayed neutron
precursors: [-140, 1-139, 1-138, 1-137 and the appropriate
bromine isotopes.

In this case the meen dwell time of iodine in the steady state
reactor is about 100 seconds. It can be seen that the activity

of lodine for a 2.5 GW(t) reactor is of the order of only 10 kilo
curies (for seconds) activity of approx. 10% (or 10% for 1000
second extraction rate).
The gas-extraction also influences the other volatile nuclides.
From a very rough estimation for these molten salts (with a
small excess of free hydrogen) the following fission products
and their associated precursors of iodine and bromine can be
volatile at 1000°C.

In elementary form: Xe, Kr, Te (7)
In simple volatile hydrides: 2rH, IH
In simple volatile chlorides: SnCl,, sbtlg, NBCL,, CaCl.

This amount of finally volatile components including I, Br, Xe,
Kr amounts to approximately half the total fission products
(i.e. 100 micromoles per second). In addition there is the cor-
responding amount of tritium (from ternary fission). This amount
of all fission products corresponds to a gas volume ratio of
about 2 cm’®/s or 10 times smaller than the postulated amount of

hydrogen flow at 30 cm?/s.

The extraction removes all short lived fission products which
are volatile under these conditions. Thus not only is the re-
moval of the iodine isotopes and the consequent reduction in
production of xenon (e.g. for the atom number: A = 135, 136,
137, 138, 138) achieved but it slows down the in-core production
of Cs-137, Cs-138, (Cs-139, and then also barium-139

The higher components of the liquid fuel: PuCl, and NaCl. The
Fuel consists of: .

- 15 mols PuCl,; boiling point 2040 K

- 55 mol% NaCl ; boiling point 1728 K

One can as a first approximation say that it would have the
following composition in the vapour phase: 5 mol% PuClyq - 95 mol%
NaCl. |

The order of magnitude of vapour for pure components at a tem-
perature of about 1250 K is

NaCl ~ 5 x 1072 bar; Pucl, nv 107% bar

For the PuClz-Nall system one assumes here a lowering of the
vapour pressure (thermodynamic activity coefficient approx. 0.1).
At the postulated volumetric flow rate of 30 cm? Ho normal per
second, the vapourized amount of plutonium is given hy:

30 cm? 4 1 -8
SSEOT om Tea X 10 bar x 10 = 10 mol Pu/s
- 175/176 -

This amount of plutonium is of the order of 10°" relative to
the amount of plutonium fissioned in the same time (approx 107°
mol Pu/s). However, it still has to be recovered, which unfort-
unately makes the reprocessing more complicated.

Last but not least is the in-core gas extrection of two other
elements

- oxygen in the form of 150 : oxygen from impurities (i.e. PuBC1)

- sulphur in the form of H,S: sulphur from the nuclear reaction:
1501 (n,p) P08 ?

/.1 Chemical behaviour of radiosulphur obtained by
>°Cl(n,p)’®s during in-pile irradiation
(according to Janovici, 19745)

<

 

 

The rather large concentration of sulphur formed by *°Cl(n,p)®°S
reaction in the moltzn chlorides system proposed for the fast
reactor makes it necessary to obtain the full information on the
chemical behaviour of the radiosulphur. The most recent studies
on the chemical states of radiosulphur obtained by n-irradiation
of alkall chlorides have shown the complexity of this problem.

Ta obtain new data on the behaviour of radiosulphur we have in-
vestigated the influence of the time and temperature of irradia-
tion and of post-irradiation heating on the chemical distribution
of the sulphur.

EXPERIMENTAL

Le eC aD Deen —- C

Sodium chloride ("Merck” reagent) was heated for G0hr at 200°C
in an oven in vacuo. The dried samples of 100 mg sealed in
evacuated (10 “torr) quartz tubes were irradiated near the core
of the "Saphir” swimming pool reactor for different periods at
a neutron flux of 5 x 10'%2 and 4.3 x 10'? n om™? s”!. Reactor
irradiations were carried out at an estimated temperature of
150°C and -190°C. After irradiation the samples were kept for

5 days to allow the decay of *“Na.

The method of *°S-spscies separalion. The crushing of the ir-
radiated ampoule was made in a special device from which the

air was removed by purging with a nitrogen stream containing
10ppM of oxygen. After crushing a gentle stream of nitrogen was
allowed to flow for about 10 min. The gases evolved were collected
in cooled traps. The irradiated slat was dissolved in 2 M KCN
snlutioncontaining carriers of S77, CONST, S047, S0,4°7. During
dissolution oxygen was not completely excluded although nitrogen
gas was passed continuously through the system. The radiosulphur
found In gaseous form was determined as barium sulphate. For

the '°S-species separation the chemical method described recently
by Kasrai and Maddock was used. The radioactive samples were
counted under a thin window Geiger counter. All measurements

were made in duplicate with and without Al-absorber.

Post-irradiation heating. The sealed irradiated ampules were
heated in an electric oven at 770°C for 2 hr or at 830°C for
about 5 min. and then cooled and crushed in a closed system under
a stream of nitrogen.
Results and discussions

Effect of length of irradiation time. As can be seen from

Fig. 7.1 S?- remains the preponderent fraction independent of
the irradiation time. Formation of S?- is indicated by charge
conservation during the *°Cl(n,p)?®°S reaction. Alternatively it
can be supposed that reduction of sulphur takes place by capture
of electrons due to the discharge of F-centers. The presence of
5% in this oxidation state in the lattice is no longer contested.
The precursors of higher forms may be S* as a result of an elec-
tron loss from S%. However, the interaction of chlorine entities
formed by irradiation with radicsulphur to form species as S5C1,
C157, SCl, may be an important mechanism in forming the per-
cursors of sulphate and sulphite.

During longer irradiations some of the sulphide is converted into
higher oxidised forms. This may be a consequence of radiation-
produced defects with oxidising character (e.g. V-centres or deri-
vatives). It is possible that the concentration of defects re-
sponsible for reduction of the sulphur decreases by annihilation
when new traps are formed. The oxidation of radiosulphur with
increase of radiation damage concentration may also be due to the
reaction of recoil sulphur with chlorine atoms. The presence of
OH” in the crystal must not be neglected. It has been suggested
that radiolysis of OH” can be responsible for accelerating the
oxidising process.

Effect of post-irradiation heating. The effect of post-irradiation
heating (including melting) can be seen in Table 7.7%.

Comparisons hetween heated and unheated samples are made for
irradiations of 2, 12 and 24 hr. For 2 hr irradiation, results

on samples heated at a temperature below the melting point of

NaCl are also presented. As is seen, on heating, a part of the
radiosulphur is found in a volatile form. The volatile radio-
sulphur appears at the expense of 5° and higher oxidation forms.
The results show that with temperatures above the boiling point

of sulphur and above melting point of NaCl the S° and SS and/or
SxCly receive sufficient kinetic energy to migrate to the surface
or even to escape from the crystal and be collected as volatile
radiosulphur. However, there are some differences in the 38q-
chemical distribution on heating below and above the melting point
nF NaCl (experiments 2-3). It seems that for relatively short
periods of irradiation (2 hr) only the sulphate and sulphite
precursors account for the volatile radicsulphur fraction. For

a longer time of irradiation, on melting the S° value decreases

to about 2% and this corresponds to an increase in the volatile
radiosulphur (experiments 5, 7). However, a small and practically
constant yield of S% is found in the melt efter longer irradiation

times. No significant changes are observed for the sulphide and
higher oxidation forms. Comparison of these results and those
presented in Fig. 1 shows that in the post-irradiation melted
samples the radiation damage does not have the same effect as

in the unmelted samples. Supplementary information can be ob-
tained by studying the effect of high temperature irradiation

on the distribution of the radiosulphur. It is possible that

in the molten state the active oxidising agents have a different
identity from those present below melting. The presence of oxygen
and probably sodium oxides during melting may have a determinant
role in deciding the state of the radiosulphur.

Effect of irradiation temperature.

A comparison of results obtained by irradiation at 423 K and

7/7 K (Table 7.2) shows that the higher oxidation fraction is
lower (3%) at 77 K. As is seen the increased S° after low tem-
perature irradiation occurs at the expense of the sulphate +
sulphite and sulphide fractions. The defects with oxidising and
reducing character formed by low temperature irradiation such
as F and V-centres (or derivatives] become important factors in
determining the radiosulphur behaviour.

/.2 Temperature dependence of sulphur species (according to
Furrer, 1977)

 

Significant amounts of the order of magnitude of thousands of
ppm *°S would be present as steady-state concentration in a
proposed fast breeder reactor fuelled with molten Pu/U-chlorides
diluted in NaCl. To obtain information about the chemical be-
Faviour, mainly the distribution of oxidation-states, the in-
fluence of irradiation temperatures (-130 and 15°C) and the
ffects of a post-irradiation heat treatment, solid NaCl was
investigated and the results published. The subject of the
rresent note are investigations at higher irradiation tempera-
tures, especially with samples molten during irradiation.

Cxperimental

Cquimnlar mixtures of NaCl and KCl ("Suprapur”, Merck) were studied
instead of pure NaCl (m.p.658 vs B00YC) because the irradiation
device permitted temperatures of up to 750°C only. The finely
crushed slat-mixture was dried in vacuo at 250°C for 24 hr and
subsequently treated with dried HCl-pas at 300°C for 24 hr in

order to remove traces of water and hydroxides. 100 mg samples

were weighed into quartz ampoules in a glove-box with a purified
nitrogen atmosphere (0, HO 10ppm).

In order to study the influence of oxygen from the surface of the
5i0,-ampoules, parts of the samples were weighed into small cruci-
bles made of gold-foil and closed hy folding the foil. The ampoules
wore evacuated to a pressure of less than 107 °mm Hg (24 hr) and
during evacuation heated to 250°C for about 8 hr to remove ad-
hering traces of HCl, sealed and irradiated for 2 hr at 500, 600

or 7000C in the swimming-pool reactor SAPHIR near the core at a
Eotal flux of about 4 x 10'2 n cm™? s7!'. The neutraon-spectrum is
not well characterised but known to be rather hard.

The post-irradiation treatment followed closely the work of (6)
as described in detail elsewhere (4.5). The ampoules were crushed
at room remperature in a nitrogen atmosphere, volatile reaction
products carried by a nitrogen gas-stream into cold-traps cooled
with liquid nitrogen and the samples subsequently dissolved in

an exygen-free carrier-solution containing cyanide and sulphide,
thiocyanate, sulphite and sulphate as carriers. The fractions were
separated. independently oxidized to sulphate, precipitated as
Has, and the activities measured with a thin-window Gi-counter.
Some experiments were made at 1509C irradiation-temperature in
order to be able to compare the CaCl/KCl-system with pure NaCl.
New irradiations of pure NaCl were carried out in order to study
the influence of the HCl pre-irradiation treatment.
- 183 -

The data for at least 2 independent experiments at 150 and 500°C
or 4-5 experiments at /009C for each set of parameters (pre-
irradiation treatment, gold-foil packing, irradiation-temperature)
are shown in the following table. Sulphite, sulphate and volatile
fractions are tabulated together as SX*., While the sulphite-
fraction was always less than 2% of the sulphate-content, the
volatile part showed large fluctuations, especially with samples
packed into gold-foil, (0.20% of the sulphate content) caused

by the variations in sample surface and tightness of the package,
even if mechanically destroyed before dissolving. The volatile
species still remaining in the slat at dissolution, presumably

as SxEly, are immediately hydrolized to sulphate and only to a
small extent to sulphite in the basic cyanide-carrier-solution.
The following figure shows the temperature-dependence of the
oxidation state distribution.

The experiments at 150° on NaCl treated with HCl-gas confirmed
the existing published results (4.5), which were obtained with
a slat dried in vacuo only.

The results of the investigations at higher temperatures and

with molten samples show a monotone decrease of the S™ ?-species
and a corresponding increase of the SX*-species with increasing
irradiation-temperature. The content of S% is influenced neither
by the pre-irradiation treatment not by the irradiation-temperature
and is always about 20%. Melting of the samples during irradiation
does not influence the distribution of oxidation states. The
studies at 1500C show for NaCl/KCl-mixtures a shift of about 20%
in 57% towards higher oxidation-states, mainly S°, compared to
pure NaCl. No influence of the pre-irradiation sample treatment
could be shown at 1500C, but it is of importance for work with
molten samples. Untreated samples without gold-foil protection
showed S~?-levels of less than 2%. HCl-treatment increased this
value to about 13%, an additional gold-foil protection to 26%.
Uxygen of the quartz surface in contact with the melt is clearly
significant at /009C. The assumption that oxygen from the quartz
surface should be of importance for reactions over the gas-phase
is not plausible, without mentioning that oxygen-levels in the
evacuated ampoules (107°, Hg) must be much greater but have no
significant influence, as low temperature experiments show.

In the shell type core to achieve the highest possible flux

in having a fast spectrum requiring a relatively high power
density. Very good mixing in the fluid, i.e. a high turbulence
is a vital requirement. For this the flow rate of the fuel has
to be kept high.

In the central regions a thermal neutron flux is obtainded
(Beryllium coated Deuterium hydroxide as moderator). The
thermal neutron flux extends partly into the fast core which
causes a very high and localised power density. This is the
reason for requiring a high fuel turbulence.

In the termal zone having a neutron flux of approx 4x10'%n cm?s !

it is possible to transmute the most 'dangercous' fission products
Strontium-90 and Caesium-13/. Table 8.1 shows the most important
parameters.

The inlet temperature was kept constant at 7509C

The most important variable was the outlet temperature

which was varied between 9359C and 39650C
For various reasons a reference concept was used as a basis for
the calculations, see Fig. 8.2. A description of the reference

8.4 The external heat exchanger

 

The most important parameter for the external heat exchanger was
selected as the volume of fuel contained in it. The decisive
factor is the minimisation of the fuel volume existing outside
the core, which influences:

- the effective specific power
(MW ith) per kg guel in the whole system)

- the effective doubling time
- safety considerations under accident conditions.
- minimisation of the loss of delayed neutrons.

For this reason a simple molten salt/sodium heat exchanger was
hose
Chosen,

The most Important properties of the two media are shown in
table 3.3.

I'he following parameters were arbitrarily chosen
- Velocity of fuel 10-15 mes!

- Velocity of sodium 10-10 mes!

- Inlet temperature of the fuel 950°C

- Furl outlet temperature 750°C
- Godium outlet temperature soc
- Salt on the tube side dia 0.0 cm

- Sodium on the shell side 0.8/1.2 to 2.2 cm pitch

Important variables

- Inlet sodium temperature

= Length of tubes

- Volume of fuel in the tubes

All these data are given in Fig. 9.10 for the case of a pitch
of 1.2 cm.

8.5 The internally cooled reactor

 

This type of reactor, has fuel circulating in the core only, with
a relatively low temperature gradient of approx. 35°C and a high
heat capacity, and a high velocity coolant 9m s~! with again a low
temperature pradient of approx. 43°C and high heat capacity. This,
coupled with the very high neeative temperature coefficient of
reactivity results in an unusually high necative thermal and
"reactivity’ stability.

Urcrease of the fuel circulation and/or coolant velocity (in the
U-tubes) results in a definite and “automatic” decrease of reactor
power without recourse to engineered methods. This points to such
a reactor being a surprisingly stable and self regulating device.

Tho achievement of the required fuel velocity in the core seems
te require a forced circulation system since the rough estimate
using natural convection gives a heat transfer coefficient which
not acceptable.
Such a forced circulation system (core only) can be one of the
following types - pump installed directly in the core, pump
outside the core, an external pump with injector, a gas lift
pump using inert gas. Consideration of the factors involved
using criteria such as reduction of the out of core inventory,
elimination of additional heat exchangers, minimisation of the
fuel leakape, minimisation of the ausiliary power, optimisation
of the fuel flow regulation - all point ot an in-core pump solu-
tion. of cource this ¢ives rise fo considerable technical prob-
blems (cooling of the rotor, corrosion and erosion, maintenance,
neutron activation etc).

The calculations for this type of reactor have been based on the
following more or less arbitrarily selected parameters:

- fuel on the shell side, with tube pitch toc diameter ratio
equal to 1.10 to 1.18.

- fuel velocity: 0.5 to 5 mes”!

- core dia: 2 and 2.7 m

- core height: 2 m

- coolant in tube with tube internal diameter equal to: 1.0 fo

7.5 om

- velocity of coolant: 1 to 17 ms !

- coolant inlet emperature 750° and 300CC

The neutronic calculation and thermo-hycdraulics were made for
T om of the core height.

The detalled representation for the temperature distribution in
a typical power reactor with a core output of 1.936 CW(th]) are
given in Fig. 8.14 (for a position 43 cm above the bottom of the
core where the neutron flux is normalised to 1).

Tho hulk temperature of fhe fuel 1s here 945°C, the temperature
af thr tube walls 85/7 - 389°C and the bulk temperature of the
0

coolant 79%1 °C.

For the total output of the core 1.330 GW(th), the power distri-
bution is as shown in Fig. 3.75.

Of course a flatter power ditribution could be obtained by ad-

Justing tube deameters and pitch across the core. (Note that in
this calculation the radial neutron flux distribution has been

taken as unperturbed).

FUEL VELOCITY ms™
- 197 -

A very encouraging indication of the good temperature distribu-
tion with very small temperature gradients is shown in Fig.
8.16 which indicates the axial bulk temperature distribution

in the fuel and in the coolant in the core.

The ofuel bulk temperature changes from 980°C at the bottom to
965°C at V4 core height and is gag” C, at 3/4 of core height. The
coolant temperature lies between 750°C inlet and 793°C outlet.
Both these small temperature gradients in the fuel and in the
coolant (fertiel material) may prove beneficial in reducing
carrosion processes due to the minimizing of mass transport
phenomena.

The stable behaviour of this type of reactor results from many
parameters. Two of them are the velocity of the coolant and its
bulk temperature. The mean power output of the core is strongly
dependant on the velocities of both fuel and coolant. Fig. 8.17.
For a fuel velocity of 2 m*s”!', when the coolant velocity falls
from 12 nes ' to A mes”! the coolant outlet temperature increases
from 784°C to 993°C for constant inlet temperature of 7507C. This
change of coolant velocity and its bulk temperature results in

the decrease of the mena core output from 2.088 GW(th) to 0.598
CW(th) - that is approximately a factor 3! It is clear since the
lower coolant velocity results in a higher coolant outlet tempe-
rature and lower power output we have definite negative temperature
coefficient (power output) varying with the given coolant velocity.

If the fuel velocity falls from 2 mes”! to 0.8 mes ! we again get
an important decrease of power output (see Fig. 3.18). The de-
crease in both fuel and coolant velocity results in a sharp
decrase of reactor power. This means that such a reactor can he
considered as a surprisingly stable and self regulating device.
In the case of a sudden fall in coolant and/or fuel velocities
the power output decreases to a safe level without intervention.

The achievement of the required fuel velocity in the core seems
to require a forced circulation system since the rough estimate
using natural convection gives a heat transfer coefficient which

is too low.

Such a force circulation system (core only) can be one of the
following types

- pump installed directly in core
- pump outside the core
- an external pump with injector

- a gas-lift pump using inert gas (argon)
Intensive consideration of the factors involved, using criteria
such as - reduction of the out of core inventory, elimination of
additional heat exchangers, minimization of the fuel leakage,
minimization of the auxilliary power, optimisation of the fuel
flow regulation, points to an in-core pump solution. Of course
this gives rise to considerable technical problems (cooling of
the rotor, corrosion and erosion, maintenance, neutron activation
eto. ).

The postulted fuel velocity makes it possible to make some cal-
culation of the heat transfer problems and also gives a feel for
the kinetics of the reactor under discussion.

It must be stressed that these kietics studies have no strong
physical sense and use an itterative approach but it is clear
that they give some useful information about the genernl reactor
stability. (see Fig. &.10].
