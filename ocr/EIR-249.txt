A Molten Salt Fast Thermal

Reactor System with no Waste

M. Taube

January 1974
Abstract

A Power system of 1 GW(e) containing a fast breeder reactor
(2GW(t)) with a molten chloride fuel and a thermal burner reac-
tor (~ 0,5 GW(t)) with molten fluoride fuel resulting in a

total breeding system with a doubling time of 30 years is des-

cribed.

The fast breeder works on a U-238/Pu-239 cycle, the thermal
burner on Pu-239. The thermal burner 'incinerates' (by neutron
transformation) most of the long lived fission products. Kr=-85,
Sr-90, Tc-99, Cs-135 and other. The actinides (Np, Am, Cm)
might be recovered from the molten salt with a high efficiency
and then burnt up in the fast reactor. The entire system pro-
duces no long lived radioactive wastes with the exception of

T and partially Cs-137.

The fast reactor has an inherent stability against power excur-
sions, and loss of coolant accidents because of the two or more
independant cooling circuits and in which the fertile material

(molten uranium chloride) plays the role of coolant.

A very high efficiency aluminium-chloride secondary coolant and
turbine working agent is proposed. Together with a district

heating system practically no thermal pollution occurs.

A very low I-131 and Xe-13%3 and low Cs-137 concentration, and
very low CsCl volability in the steady state core due to con-
tinuous gas extraction guarantees the high safety level of this

system,
I. Why a new reactor system?

 

The present generation of power reactors both thermal and fast
both liquid-cooled (water or sodium) and gas-cooled, use solid
fuel. The single reactor type with positive experience of liquid
fuel is the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (thermal reactor with
molten fluoride and with breeding ratio ~1.05) (Rosenthal, 1972).
Some other molten salt fast reactors have also been discussed

in the literature over several years (Taube, 1961, 1967,

Nelson 1967).

The liquid fuel molten salt reactors have some specific charac-
teristics which make them more attractive for future use, espe-
cially in form of a coupled system of two molten salt power

reactors as 1s proposed here

1) a fast breeder reactor with molten chloride fuel

2) a thermal burner with molten fluoride fuel.

This system appears to have the following special features which
results in a reactor unit much more fitted to the future pattern
of energy production than are the present day solid fuel reac-

tors:
1) high inherent stability

2) much smaller environmental hazard

3) elimination of long lived fission product wastes and other

radicactive wastes

4) better suited to district heating systems with a rela-

tively high thermal efficiency for electricity generation.
AN

The "fast breeder - thermal burner" system proposed here has

the following specific characteristics

1) inherent stability against power excursions which arise
out of the following chain of events: criticality increase~
power excursion » temperature increase » density decrease -
movement of part of the fuel out of the core -» very strong

negative influence on the criticality.

2) in the fast breeder reactor the loss of coolant is at the
same time the less of blanket which results in a very high
negative coefficient of reactivity in this "Loss of Coolant
Accident. The reactor thus shuts down without an engineered

scram.

3) continuous purging of the liquid fuel in the core by means
of a hydrogen/helium stream for extraction of the vola-
tile fission products especially the most hazardous I-131
and Xe-13%3 and also I-137, Xe-137, the volatile precursors
of Cs-13%7 which have a large effect on the environmental

impact in any reactor accident.

4) continuous reprocessing of liquid fuel with extraction of
the long lived fission products (e.g. Kr-85, Sr-90, Zr-93
Tc-99, I-129, Cs-135) and the burning (neutron transfor-

mation) of them in a thermal reactor.

5) continuous reprocessing (with high yield) of the actinides

(Np, Am, Cm) and continuous burning in the fast core.

6) the possibility of having a combined breeding ratio for
both the fast and thermal reactors coupled together,
greater than 1, achieving a doubling time of approx.

30 years.

with the exception of tritium, virtually no nett rejec-
tion of radioactive wastes to the environment, if Cs-137
has been stored practically all the waste is transformed

in the form of stable or semi-stable nuclides.

some of the corrosion processes of molybdenum (structural
material) occuring in the core and blanket may be control-

led by the continuous gas purging system.

the high thermal efficiency for electrical energy produc-
tion of the total power system (55 % for only electrical,
or 40 % for combined electrical and district heating
system) results from the use of a chemically dissociating
medium as secondary coolant and turbine working agent
(ALCL).

the system would seem to be suitable for an underground and

fully automatic power plant of high safety.

this type of reactor gives, as do other molten salt systems,
a complete independance from foreign supplies (no fuel-
element manufacture, no external reprocessing plant) and

has the ability to 'burn-rocks' - i.e. low grade uranium
"ores" from granites.

fission products coming from both reactors fast and thermal

Since the system contains both breeder and burner reactors and
since a combined breeding ratio greater than 1 is required the
relationship of the power of the fast breeder and thermal burner

is the highest importance.

The problem of the achievement of the breeding ratio for the
total system can be solved by the following simplified calcula-

tions concerning the ratio between the respective powers.

III. The Fast Breeder Reactor

In this study a 2000 MW(t) fast breeder molten chlorides reactor
was used. (Fig. 3 and 4)

The detailed describtion of the reactor type was recently given
(Taube, Ligou, 1973). The most important characteristics are

summarised here: (Table 3 and 4)

1) the liquid fuel contains only plutonium chlorides diluted
by other metal chlorides. The in core breeding ratio is
realised by the presence of the uranium-238 chloride
(diluted by other metal chlorides) which acts as the coo-
ling agent flowing in the tubes.

2) the fertile material (238 UCl,/NaCl) is at the same time

the cooling material and the blanket material.

A very important and desirable feature of this fast reactor can
be seen when the "maximal design accident" is discussed. This

appears to be the Loss of Cooling Accident (LOCA) (Fig. 5)
The LOCA in fast reactor arises from two events.

1) the increase of criticality due to each coolant (even
helium) being a neutron absorber and the loss of coolant
results in an increase of neutron flux in the core (a
trivial point is that in a thermal water cooled reactor

"the Loss of Coolant" 1s also a "loss of Moderator" which
reduces the criticality); thus in a fast reactor the LOCA

must be accompanied by an engineered snut-down device.

2) the radioactive decay heat of fission products is approx
7 % of the normal steady state power level and is high
enough to melt the clad and in some cases the fuel in a
few tens of seconds from the LOCA, especially in fast

reactors with a high volumetric specific power.

The "Emergency Core Cooling Systems" are still under critical

review.

Here in this type of fast reactor, both "negative" effects of
LOCA could be virtually eliminated by means of the following

design features (not shut-down devices):

1) the cooling system is coupled with the blanket, that is
the cooling agent plays the role of fertile blanket

material.

2) the cooling system including the blanket region is divided

into two or more fully independant circuits.

3) it is postulated here that a major accident will cause com-
plete destruction of all but one of these independant cir-

cuit systems and one of the fuel pumps is intact.

4) the cooling system sub-divides into several if not all

parts of the cooling region.

During an accident the loss of coolant accident thus brings about
a corresponding loss of blanket in the region affected. The loss
of blanket gives a very strong negative coefficient of reacti-
vity which is clear from Table 4. The roughly estimated value is
approw (7 * 1%)/N where N is the number of independant cooling/
blanket circuits. In this reactor a failure in only one out of
four circuits results in a reactivity decrease of (7 * 1%)/4

which is equivalent to a full scram.
21

Thus the reactor stops without the use of any engineered devices.
It seems that this is the only type of fast reactor with inherent

negative criticality against the Loss of Coolant Accident.

The radioactive decay heat still has to be removed, if not, the
vessel and cooling tubes may melt down. In this reactor the one
remaining intact cooling circuit is able to remove this heat,

because the molten fuel acts as the internal heat transport me-

dium and assists the heat removal to the one intact system.

IV, The thermal burner reactor

 

As is shown in chapter VI the most effective neutron transforma-
tion of a large part of the long lived fission products is possib-
le in a thermal neutron flux because the products of cross section
and flux (0; . bs) is often larger for thermal neutrons (g,=

thermal) than for fast neutrons (see Fig. 16).

This is one of the reasons for using a thermal burner for the

rransformation.

Some general remarks about the criteria for this thermal burner

are given below:

1) the thermal neutron flux must be as high as possible

but as will be show there is an upper limit. It appears

that a flux of 3 - 6 x 101° em st is most suitable
(e.g. for Op = 5 barns; o-@ = (5 x 107%) X
(6 x 107°) = 2X 1078571 which corresponds to an effec-

tive half life of 2.25 years).
22

2) the specific volumetric power should not be too high
because the thermal core volume and the neutron balance
has to be kept to a size to accommodate the appropri-
ate amounts of neutron absorbing fission products (e.g.
specific power 1-2 MW/litre) (for 1 MW/1l the core volume
is 500 1, for 2 MW/1l the volume is ~250 1).

3) the specific power per unit volume must not be too high
to keep the total power down. The thermal core 1s intended

as a burner only, that is with breeding ratio zero.

4) the core containing only fissionable nuclide, moderator
and appropriate fission products must give the best possible

neutron balance. The following two postulates are added.
5) no fertile material in the core

6) no coolant in the core except for the fuel itself which
is cooled by means of out of core heat exchangers. The
fuel is also in liquid form to permit continuous repro-

cessing.

As will be seen from the following discussions the apropriate
specific volume power for this core is choosen to be as high as

possible: 2 MW/1.

(HFIR Reactor in Oak Ridge, USA; 100 MW(t): 100 litre core; 1 MW/1)
CM-2 Reactor in Mellekes, Soviet Union 50 MW(t); litre; MW/1
both with mean neutron fluxes of 6 x 101° n em “st, It must be
stressed that a more conservative figure of 1 MW/1l and flux of

15

3 x 10 n em st would also meet the requirements but of course
with lower effectiveness (higher steady state concentration of
fission products). Fig. 6 and 7 give some details concerning the
thermal high flux burner. Some datas concerning the neutron ba-

lance of the thermal burner reactor are given on the Table 5.
23

It is worh mentioning the possibility of a neutron coupled fast/
thermal system which would help to solve the problem should the
thermal burner reactor have too small a k_ due to the large
amounts of neutron absorbing fission products present. In redu-
cing the leakage from the thermal reactor it could be that neu-
tron coupling will improve the entire neutron balance raising the

system breeding ratio over 1.1. (Fig. 8)

V. The in-core continuous gas purging

 

V.a)

General remarks

In this reactor an in-core continuous gas purging of the molten

fuel is postulated which significantly improves the safety of this

reactor in an in-core accident.

A mixture of hydrogen-helium gas is continously bubbled through

the liquid fuel in the core. The mean dwell time of the gas-bubb-

les needs to be controlled and the mean transport time of the

molten components to these bubbles must also be controlled (e.g.

if speed-up is desired-intensive mixing, if delay-local addition

of a further gas stream).

The aim of the gas stripping is as follows:

1)

2)

3)

¥)

to remove the volatile fission products which in the case
of an accident control the environmental hazard. (I-131,
Xe-133, Kr-85 and precusors of Cs-137 and at the same
time for the thermal reactor, removal of the I-135, pre-

cursor of Xe-135, improves the neutron balance.

to control the production of delayed neutrons since most
of the precursors and nuclides of this group are very

volatile, e.g.: Br-I-isotopes.

removal of oxygen and sulphur, continously (see Chapter
VIII)

in situ control of corrosion problems on structural ma-

terials (see Chapter VIII).

For the sake of a first approximation a gas flux of 30 cm- per sec.

(normal state) of H,/He is arbitrarily assumed. At 20 bar pressure
30

and with a dwelling time in core of 20 seconds, the gas bubbles
5

will only occupy a fraction of the core equal to 10 © of its volu-
me and has little influence on the criticality, (but the collap-

sing of bubbles results in a positiv criticality coefficient).

The system proposed for continuous removal of the volatile fission
product from the core itself has a retention time of some hundreds
of seconds only. Each reprocessing mechanism which operates out

of core is limited by the amount of molten fuel being pumped

from the core to the reprocessing plant. This amount, due to the
high capital cost of the fuel and high operation costs cannot be
greater than that which gives a fuel in-core dwell time of about
one week. Even with a 1 day dwell time, that is, if a after one
day the fuel goes through the reprocessing plant, no acceptable
solution to the I-131 problem is obtained since the activity of
this nuclide is only diminished by one order of magnitude

(see Fig. 9).

Only a direct in-core removal gives the dwell time in core as

low as some hindreds of seconds.

V.b) Delayed neutrons emitters

The principal question arise out of the fact that some of the
short lived iodine and bromine (perhaps also arsenic, tellurium)

isotopes are the precursors of the delayed neutrons.

As other possible nuclides the following can be considered:

As-85; Kr-92,-93; Rb-92,-93,-94; Sr-97,-98; Te-136,-137; Cs-142,-14%,
The removal of these delayed-neutron precursors from the core re-

duces the value of B, which 1s lower for Pu-239 than U-23%5.

Thus we have a problem of reaching a compromise between a removal
as rapid as possible of the hazardous I-131, and as long a dwell
time in the core for the delayed neutron precursors: 1-140, I-139,

1-138, 1-137 and the appropriate bromine isotopes.

The compromise is given by a quasi-steady state regime in the core
in which the amounts of isotopes present are given as an example

in Fig. 10.

In this case the mean dwell time of iodine in the steady state
reactor is about 100 seconds. From the curve in Fig. 9 1t can be
seen that the activity of iodine for a 2.5 GW(t) reactor is of
the order of only 10 k curies (for 100 seconds) instead of

~ 100 M curies in the steady state, a decrease of activity of

5

approx. 10" (or 10° for 1000 second extraction rate).

V. ¢) Gas-extraction and other fission products

The gas-extraction also influence the other volatile nuclides.
From a very rough estimation for these molten salts (with a
small excess of free hydrogen) the following fission products
and their associated precursors of iodine and bromine can be

volatile at ~ 1000 °c.

In elementary form: Xe, Kr, Te (2)

In simple volatile hydrides: BrH, IH

In simple volatile chlorides: SnCl,, SbCl NbCl,, cdci,.

3° 2

This amount of finally volatile components including I, Br, Xe,

Kr amounts to approximately half the total fission products (i.e.
100 micromoles per second). In addition there is the corresponding
amount of tritium (from ternary fission). This amount of all fis-
2s
or 10 times smaller than the postulated amount of hydrogen flow

at 30 em” /s . For volatile fission products release: see (Farmer,
1973; Beattie, 1973).

sion products corresponds to a gas volume ratlo of about 2 cm
35

The extraction removes all short lived fission products which are
volatile under these conditions. Thus not only is the removal of
the iodine isotopes and the consequent reduction in production

of xenon (e.g. for the atom number: A = 135, 136, 137, 138, 139)
achieved but it slows down the in-core production of Cs-137,
Cs-138, Cs-139 and then also Barium-139 (Fig. 11).

The gas extraction will also cause the vaporization of the higher

components of the liquid fuel: PuCl, and NaCl.

The fuel consists of:

~ 15 mol% PuCl boiling point 2040°K

55
- 85 mol% NaCl ; boiling point 1738%K

(see Fig. 12).

One can as a first approximation say that it would have to follo-

wing composition in the vapour phase: 5 mol% PuCl, - 95 mol% NaCl.

5

The order of magnitude of vapour for pure components at a tempera-
ture of about 1250 K is

NaCl ~5 x 107° bar; PuCl, ~107" bar

For the PuCl,-NaCl system one assumes here a lowering of the

vapour pressure (thermodynamic activity coefficient approx 0.1).

This amount of plutonium is of the order of 107" relative to the
amount of plutonium fissioned in the same time (approx 107"
mol Pu/s). However, it still has to be recovered which makes

the reprocessing unfortunately more complicated.

Last but not least is the in-core gas extraction of two other

elements
- oxygen in the form of H,0 : oxygen from impurities (i.e.
PuOC1l)
- sulphur in the form of H5S: sulphur from the nuclear reac-

VI. The neutron transformation of the fission products

VI. Principle of neutron transformations

Some of long lived radioactive nuclides are shown in Fig. 13 and
14,

The aim of this part of the paper is firstly to discuss the possi-
bility of the steady state nuclear transformation (steady state
burning) in the thermal neutron region, of the larger part of

the long lived fission products. A first approximation for the
solutions of this problem is given here and a further discussion

initiated.

In Fig. 15 are given the nuclide transformations under a high

flux discussed here.

This problem of nuclear transformation of fission and non-fissio-
nable actinides, being the irradiation products, has been discussed
for many years. The most recent remarks and calculations con-
cerning this problem made the following claim: "It is not practi-
cal to burn fission product wastes in power reactors because the
rieutron fluxes are too low. Developing special burner reactors

with the required (thermal) neutron flux of the order of
C17
10

nem “s or burning in the blankets of thermonuclear reac-
tors is beyond the limits of current technology. It seems reaso-
nable to extract three actinides (Np, Am, Cm, (M.T.)) for separate

storage or for recycling through the reactors that produce them"

(Claiborne, 1972).
42

Also a controlled thermonuclear reactor CTR was used for calcu-
lation of neutron transformations. In those calculations a neutron
flux of 5 x 1091 em” 2s”! was used with remark that this flux
level is somewhat higher than that usually associated with CTR
power plants (Wolkenhauer, 1972, 1973). A three year irradiation
was proposed but it would seem that for the most important fission
products the neutron build-up in relation to the radioactive

decay plays a relatively small role; e.g. for Strontium-90 after

3 years irradiation all neutron reaction products from (n,y) and
(n, 2n) are lower than 10% of those from the radioactive decay
products Sr-90 and for Cs-137 only (n, 2n) products result in

~ 40% of the radioactive decay products. But (n, 2n) reactions

need a rather hard neutron spectrum (Gore, Leonard, 1973).

VI. b Cross sections and neutron fluxes for nuclear transformations

 

In this system the following simple evaluations are made

1) the amount of fission pr-ducts coming from both the fast

breeder (2000 MW) and the thermal burner (500 MW)

2) the cores are purged by means ol gas (He + i, stream) for

evacuation of some volatile nuclides (Kr, Xe, Br, I)
3) the fuels and blanket materials are continually reprocessed
4) the irradiated fission products are continuously (or perio-
dically) separated for the sake of eliminating the daughter
stable nuclides (e.g. Yr-90 and Zr-91 rrom the decay and

burning of Sr-90)

5) the amounts C in steady state (ss) burning are calculated

by the obvious relationship for the i-th nuclide.

A more complicated problem is the need for the separation of the
two caesium isotopes Cs-13%5 for thermal burning and Cs-137 for
fast burning or out of core storage. From Fig. 11 it can be seen
that the in-core gas extraction takes out the precursors of
Cs-135, that 1s the long lived volatile I-135 and Xe-135, but the
short lived precursors of Cs-137 remain in the fuel, so the sepa-

ration of these isotopes is possible (see Chapter VII).

Among the most dangerous long lived radioactive wastes are some

of the actinides (see Fig. .13, 14).

The problem of the "destruction" of these nuclides: Np-237,
Pu-23%8, Am-241, Am-243, Cm-244, Cm-245, is simple. In any high
flux fast or thermal reactor because of the relatively large
cross sections these actinides are burned up, the problem is
only limited by the present state of the reprocessing technology
of irradiated fuel. In the most obvious aqueous processes e.g.
the aqueous phase - organic phase extraction, these elements:
Np, Am, Cm being hydrolysed, because of a relatively low concen-
tration, and in the hydrolysed form are not extractable by many
organic extractants. Of course a more refined aqueous process
could give a significant improvement in the recovery of these
actinides making it possible to recycle in the fuel and eventual-

ly to burn-up (Fig. 20 and 21).

In the fused salt fast-thermal system proposed here the recovery
of the actinides seems much easier and simpler due to the fact

that

1) the reprocessing occurs not in an aqueous but in a molten
salt medium; the hydrolysis of the low concentration

actinides is not possible; the recovery is very high.

2) the continuous remotely operated extraction processes and

preparation of the liquid fuel, and the absence of fuel

elements etc, make this recycling of the actinides (very

hazardous alpha and partly neutron emitters) possible

and desirable.

The
the

high grade recovery of the actinides postulated here gives

steady state results for the fast reactor shown in Fig. 20

and 21. The reason for burning in the fast and not in the ther-

mal

reactor is based on the fact that the relation 61/65" is

greater in the fast reactor than in the thermal.

It must be remembered that the relatively high neutron flux

results not only in the irradiation of the non desirable radio-

active nuclides but also the stable fission products, not to

mention the stable components of the fuel and the structural

material. A very short review of these partial processes is

given here

The effective burning of the most important long lived nuclides
needs a rather complicated reprocessing plant with high tempera-
ture pyrochemical separation methods, both in gaseous and liquid
salt or/and metallic phases. In some cases also a retention volume

is necessary (for spontaneus decay of short-lived nuclides).

This reprocessing philosophy arises from the following assumptions:
The caesium nuclides are very hazardous but there are at least
two isotopes Cs=-135 (t 1/2 = 2 x 10%2) and Cs-137 (t 1/2 2 30 a).

The first one has a reasonable cross section from the point of

view of neutron transformation (oh, £2 8 barn), the second a very
small cross section in both fast and thermal reactors of = 100 mb
or less, oth = 110 mb). The separation of two flows e.g. Cs-135

for thermal burning and Cs=137 for quasi burning (rather self-

decaying) could help solve this problem.

In this system the continuous in core gas purging system is expec-
ted to extract some of the volatile fission products especially
those with. longer half life period. In the case of caesium the

separation of both isotopes is possible due to the different time

The extractable volatile and relatively long lived nuclides in
short time gas purging are underlined. The Cs-135 could be

extracted in the form of the precursors. Cs-137 is retained in
the fuel and must be separated by more conventional (but not so

simple) methods.
58

Another similar problem arises in the case of zirconium isotopes
(see Fig. 18/IV) and iodine (Fig. 18/II1). Part of the zirconium
could be used as a diluent of the homogenous fuel for the thermal
core (e.g. 20 molj ZrF), + 80 mol% FeF,) part as component of the
molten fuel for the fast core (?) and part in metallic form as
structural (but radioactive) material when in the final period of
fast reactor development when the Zr-93 will be reduced to less

than 1 mass % of the total zirconium

Some further similar questions will have to be discussed, in some
a separation of isotopes is possible by means of rapid in core
gas extraction or slow out of core (liquid phase) separation

process.

A preliminary draft of the possible reprocessing scheme is given

in Fig. 23.

VIII. Molybdenum and corrosion processes

 

Tne corrosion processes in this type of reactor are of crucial
importance. In the cores of these reactors are approx 950 kg

molybdenum or approx 10'000 mol.

We postulate here, arbitrarily, a relatively high corrosion rate
equivalent to a full or 100% corrosion of the complete amount

of molybdenum in approx 10 years. This means a corrosion rate of:

10'000 mol molybdenum -5
= 3 x 10 mol/s = 30 um/s

 

10 years x (3.1 x 107s /year)

Thus 30 micromoles molybdenum per second (or approx 3 mg Mo/s).
In addition to this we have molybdenum as fission product. In
the 2000 MW(t) fast reactor the amount of fissioned plutonium

equals:

2000 MW(t) x 1 day x (1.06 g Pu/MWd(t)) = 2150 g Pu/day

or: 25 mg Pu/s: that is; 100 yu mol Pu/s.

The production side of fission products equals 200 yu mol/s.
Molybdenum is present at about 18 mol% of fission products which
means a 36 uy mol/s, or almost half the amount of corroding ma-
terial. From both sources, corrosion and fissioning the amount
of molybdenum is about 50 p mol/s. The corrosion processes can

go in three directions

1) Chloride reaction Mo +2 CL + Met > MoCl, + Me
met 2 met

2) Oxygen reaction Mo ot + 0, > MoO,

3) Tellurium reaction Mo ot + Te, + MoTe,

These and eventually other molybdenum corrosion processes are
potentially dangerous and should when possible be prevented in
tne core itself. This possibility exists due to the reaction

with the gaseous hydrogen (see also Chapter IV).

In the extreme case the molar amount of hydrogen is twice as big

as that of molybdenum giving 120 u mol Hy/s.

Under normal conditions (1 bar, 0°C) this amount of hydrogen is

acceptable:

For further calculations we arbitrarily assume ten times more,

Here is a major question concerning the reaction of metallic
molybdenum with hydrogen. From about 100 elements there are only

twelve elements which form no chemical binding with hydrogen.

a" a’ a® al a®
3d - Electrons Mn Fe Co
blag - Electrons Mo Te Ru Rh
5d - Electrons Ww Re Os Ir Pt

Thus molybdenum fulfills the minimum requirements: it has no
reaction with hydrogen. Also manganese-cobalt alloys are suitable

for this reactor (chromium and nickel not!).

In addition the solubility of hydrogen in molybdenum is relatively
small. The dependence of the solubility of H, in Mo-metal on ftem-
perature and pressure is known since molybdenum is a possible
constructional material for containing plasma (hydrogen) in fusion
reactors. Also the diffusion of hydrogen through metallic molyb-

denum is relatively very small (see Fig. 26).

The diffusion rate of hydrogen from the melted fuel to coolant

and blanket (here also uel, - NaCl) needs to be discussed.

One can assume, however, that also this melt with hydrogen

is saturated so that the porosity of the wall (molybdenum) will
play a minor role. The most important: the variation in mechani-
cal properties of the molybdenum caused by the dissolved hydro-

gen.

The problem of the corrosion of molybdenum in chlorine containing
media is particularly complicated by the numerous molybdenum

chlorides: MoCl,, MoCl., MoCl,, MoCl.

Also the oxygen chlorine systems for molybdenum and some selec-

ted fuel components including hydrogen are rather complex
(Fig. 24).

In the region of the external heat exchanger the main corrosion
process results from the action of gaseous aluminium chloride

(the secondary working agent)

ALCL, + : Mo : MoCl, + ALCL, )
(g) (g) &

This reaction has been discussed in earlier publications (Blander
1957) but unfortunately not all the thermodynamic data 1s known.
The stability of the molybdenum chlorines is of course strongly
influenced by the concentration of free chlorine and also by

the temperature.

A more detailed calculation of metallic molybdenum corrosion in
the aluminium trichloride is needed. These calculations are

very sensitive to the vapour pressure of chlorides. More detailed
calculations of the corrosion in this system have been given

earlier (Taube, Schumacher 1969).

IX. Molybdenum and iron irradiated in a fast high flux reactor
IX a) Nuclear effects

The high neutron flux irradiation causes physical and chemical

changes in structural materials.

Molybdenum is a mixture of stable isotopes (Fig. 27). The most
important by-product of neutron irradiation is the Tc-99 beta-
emitter with t 1/2 2 2.1 x 10° year and which belongs to the

chain (stable nuclides underlined)

IX b) Radiolysis of molten chlorides in very high flux of fast

neutron

The high flux of neutrons and especially of the fission fragments
results in a high damage in the fuel material and cladding. In
the type of reactor under discussion this problem seems to be

much easier to solve because

1) the molten chlorides are fluids with structure that is
with a very low activation energy for recombination of
the radiolysis product and therefore with a very high

recombination velocity.

2) in core there are no structural materials (tube, claiding

ete.)
70

X. Aluminium trichloride as a secondary coolant and working agen®

 

In this consideration for the power production a non conventional
gas-turbine cycle is postulated: we have chosen aluminium tri-

chloride, ALCL.

Tt is now clear that this chosen secondary coolant-working fluid
substance has specific additional properties, which make 1t
particularly intersting in the present application. The reason
is the following: it is well known that real progress in im-
provement of the thermal efficiency of turbines is limited by

two parameters:

1) for steam turbines, corrosion effects with non austenic
steel above 580°C on the one hand, and on the other hand
the dramatic increase of costs when an austenic steel is

used.

2) for gas turbines (e.g. helium), the operation of the gas-
compressor consumes more tnan half of the energy produced
by the power turbines. A number of methods are available
for overcoming these limitations, one of these proceeds
as follows: the working agent in the turbine, when the
temperature decreases undergoes a chemical reaction which
decreases the volume. This result is most conveniently
obtained when the working substance polymerises at the
lower temperature. Of course, this polymersiation must
be completely reversible, that is to say that, at the
higher temperature, the depolymerisation process is
effectively complete. One of the most promising working

agent is aluminium trichloride, which, at the lower
71

temperature dimerises by the following mechanism:

(2 aici) B@S ~ (Al1.c1,)8%2° _ (Al. cl. )tta-
3 27767 2776 .
monomer dimer dimer
higher temp. lower temp. lower temp.

When the temperature increases a monomerisation process takes
place. Already in 1959 Blander and co-workers discussed the prob-
lem of AlCl, as working agent. They wrote: "A number of typical

application (including a gas turbine cycle employing AlCl, as the
working fluid and a binary vapour cycle employing water vapour
for the lower temperature: M.T.) have been consldered but in none
of these has the aluminium chloride shown outstanding advantages
over more conventional media. However, it is believed that for
some special applications it may well prove to have outstanding
advantages, where the characteristics of the other system com-
ponents are such as to make it possible to exploit to the fullest

“
the unique characteristics of aluminium chloride" (Blander, 1959).

Much more optimistic conclusions could be seen in the papers of
Krasin and Nesterenko (1972). These authors maintain that the
overall thermal efficiency of a dual cycle with aluminium chlo-
ride as working fluid in the high temperature cycle and HO, in
the low temperature cycle promises to increase up to 60% for

800 °C and 90 ata (see also: Krasin, 1971).

But with aluminium chloride and with nitrogen dioxide the chemi-
cal industry has considerable experience, including experience
wlth corrosion problems, in the high-temperature region. Unfor-
tunately there seems to be a lack of data concerning the erosion
and corrosion behaviour of these substances in turbines and on

their behaviour under neutron irradiation in reactor conditions.
72

Aluminium chloride as a working fluid in a condensation turbine

has the following advantages:

1) the efficiency of the power generation is about 30-50%
higher than for the "classical" working fluids; helium
or steam. The quantity of fuel used is correspondingly
smaller. For a country in which the sources of uranium an

and plutonium are limited this advantage may be decisive.

2) the waste heat is smaller an the temperature of the hea-
ting water is lower. In a country in which the only sources
of cooling water are the rivers, such an advantage is of

importance,

3) the size of the turbine is approximately 5 times smaller
than for a steam turbine of the same power. For a direct
cycle (when the reactor coolant agent is the working fluid
in the turbine) when the circuit is radioactive the small

size of turbine is an important factor.

4) all these properties of an aluminium chloride circuit have
a significant influence in reducing the capital cost of

a power station.

Let us repeat the advantageous properties: decreased fuel con=-
sumption, reduction of waste heat, decrease of turbine size. All
these trends promise to give a significant reduction in power

generating costs.

The crucial problem of possible corrosion processes caused by

ALCL, may be controlled by the small addition of hydrogen.
