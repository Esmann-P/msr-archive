MATERTALS DEVELOPMENT FOR MOLTEN-SALT EREEDER REACTORS

H. B. McCoy, Jr., and J. R. Weir, Jr.

ABSTRACT

We have described the materials development program
that we feel necessary to ensure the successful construction
and operation of a molten-salt breeder reactor. The pro-
posed reactor is a two-region system utilizing a uranium-
bearing fluoride fuel salt and a thorium-bearing fluoride
blanket salt. A third lower melting fluoride salt will be
used as a coolant for transferring the heat from the fuel
and blanket salts to the supercritical steam. The primary
structural materials are graphite and modified Hastelloy N.
The individual fuel cells will be constructed of graphite
tubes. These tubes must withstand neutron doses of the order
of 1073 neutrons/en’ and must have very low permeability: to
gases (because of 127%e entrapment) and fused salts. These
requirements mean that we need a graphite that is slightly

- better than any currently available. We have described in

detail what graphites are available and their respective
properties. A line of action for obtaining improved grades
of graphite is proposed along with a test program for
evaluating these new products.

Modified Hastelloy N will be used in all parts of the
system except the reactor core. Since standard Hastelloy N
is embrittled at elevated temperatures by neutron irradiation,
it has been necessary to modify the composition of the alloy
with a small addition of titanium. The program necessary for
fully developing this modified alloy as an. engineering material
is described in detail,

An integral part of the proposed system is a joint between
the tubular graphite fuel channels and the modified Hastelloy N.
Brazing alloys have been developed specifically for this job

“and a reasonable design for the joint has been made. The

integrity of the Joint must be. demonstrated by engineering
tests.

Several areas require the development of suitable inspec-
tion techniques. -These techniques are further complicated by
the fact that they must be adaptable to remote inspection
inside the reactor cell.

Although numerous problems exist which will require further
development, none of these appear insolvable. Hence, we feel
that the materials development program can proceed at a rate
consistent with that proposed for the Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor.

 
 

 

<Q.

INTRODUCTION

The proposed molten-salt breeder reactors® will require some advances
in materials technology. However, the construction and operation of the
Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment have given us invaluable insight concerning
what advances are necessary. We feel that we can make these advances on a
time schedule that is consistent with that proposed for the Molten-Salt
‘Breeder Reactor.

From & materials standpoint, the reactor is easily divided | into two
sections: (1) the core and (2) the reactor vessel and associated piping.
The requirements of the material for use within the core are (1) good
moderation, (2) low neutron absorption, (3) compatibility with the molten
salt—Hastelloy N system, (4) low permeability to both salt and fission gases,
(5) fabricable into tubular shapes, (6) capable of being joined to the rest
of the system, and (7) capable of maintaining all the above properties after
accumulated neutron doses of 1023 neutrons/cn? . ‘Graphite is the preferred
material for the core, and the Grade CGB graphite used in the MSRE satis-
fies most of the stated requirements. The main additional requirements

wo

©

are that we develop the technology for producing tubular shapes of a com-
parable material with slightly improved gas permeability and then demon-
strate that this material will retain its integrity to neutron doses of
1023 neutrons/cm?. Tubes of the desired quality can be produced in the
near future. Available data on the radiation damage of graphite to doses
of 2 to 3 x 1022 neutrons/cm? indicate that the material is capable of the
anticipated doses. ~

The rest of the system — the core vessel, heat exchangers, and piping -
© will see a considerably lower neutron flux. The requirements of a material
for this application include (1) resistance to corrosion by fluoride salts,
(2) compatibility with the core material, (3) capable of being fabricated
into complicated shapes by conventional processes such as roiling, forging,
and welding, (4) good mechanical strength and ductility at temperatures over
the expected service range of 100 to 1300°F, and (5) capable of maintaining:

reasonable strength and ductility after exposure to a neutron environment.

Hastelloy N satisfies most of these requirements. ‘This alloy was developed

at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory specifically for. use in molten-salt

systems. However, our experiences with this alloy in the MSRE indicate
that it has at least two disadvantages: a propensity for weld cracking
and severe reduction of high-temperature ductility after irradiation. The
first problem can be solved by using vacuum-melted material, but slight
changes in the alloy composition will be necessary to minimize the radia-
tion damage problem. - We have found that a slightly modified alloy con-
taining 0.5 wt % Ti has good weldability and reasonable resistance to
radiation damage. =

This report presents the present state of knowledge of these two
materials, graphite and Hastelloy N, as they affect an MSBR., The first
section discusses Hastelloy N and the second discusses graphite. The
final section briefly presents the program required to extend the develop-
ment of these materials to a stage where they may be used in the MSER
WhtYe considerable development and testing must be accomplished to pro-
vide the assured performance necessary for a reactor system, it appears

that adequate materials can be obtained for a molten-salt breeder reactor.
STATUS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF HASTELIOY N
. General Properties

During the early stages of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Program,

many metals and alloys were screened to determine their resistance to

molten fluorides. Primarily on the basis of these results, the nickel-
molybdenum system was selected ‘as the most: promising for: additional study.

A molybdenum concentration. range ‘of. 15 to 20% was selected, since this
~yielded single-phase. alloys with their inherent metallurgical stability.

Various other alloying additions were studied in order to improve the

~ mechanical properties and oxidation resistance of the basic binary alloy.

The Hastelloy N alloy resulted: from this program and was used for the MSRE.
The chemical composition is listed in Table 1.
Hastelloy N is a nickel-base alloy that is solution strengthened with

molybdenum and has an optimized chromium content to maximize oxidation

resistance and to minimize corrosion by fluoride salts. The chemistry
has been controlled to preclude aging embrittlement. The aluminum,
titanium, and carbon contents are limited to minimize severe fabrication
and corrosion problems, and the boron content is limited to prevent weld
cracking. Iron is included to allow more choice of starting materials
for melting. The extreme examples of permissible combinations of elements
allowed by the chemistry specification were studied, and in no case did
any undesirable brittle phases develop. Carbides of the form M;3Ce and
MC exist in the alloy and are stable to at least 1800°F.

The MSRE was constructed using conventional practices (comparable to
those used for a stainless steel system) and from material obtained from
commercial vendors. The major materials problem encountered was one of

weld cracking, which was eventually overcome by slight changes in melting

practice and by strict quality control of the material, Heats of material
subject to weld cracking were identified and thereby eliminated by means

_ of a special weld-cracking test that was included as a part of the

specifications.

Physical Properties

Several physical properties of Hastelloy N are listed in Table 2.
Specific heat, electrical resistivity, and thermal conductivity data all

show inflections with respect to temperature at 1200°F. This is thought

to be due to an order-disorder reaction; however, no changes in mechanical
u

properties are detectable as a result of this reaction.

Mechanical Properties

The composition and the fabrication procedure for Hastelloy N have been
optimized with respect to resistance to salt corrosion, oxidation resistance,
and freedom from embrittling aging reactions. The strength of the alloy
is greater than the austenitic stainless steels and comparable with the
stronger alloys of the "Hastelloy type."

Design data for this alloy were established by performing mechanical
property tests on experimental heats of commercial size.? Data from this
study were reviewed by the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Committee
and Code approval was obtained under Case 1315 for Unfired Pressure Vessel
construction and Case 1345 for Nuclear Vessel construction. The recognized
allowable stresses are tabulated in Table 3. The commercial heats used

for MSRE construction exhibited strengths equal to or greater than the

- experimental heats.

~~ Tensile Properties?

Tensile tests were performed on the experimental heats and specifica-

tions were thereby established for the commercial heats. Figure lis a

for both types of material. Similar data on the 0.2% offset yleld strength
are shown in Fig. 2. The values for fracture ductility are presented in
Fig. 3. In all cases, the values for the commercial heats were well within
the band obtained from the experimental heats. The values from both the
longitudinal and transverse specimens are comparable, showing no anisotropy
effects. Metallographic data indicate that the heats with low carbon, and
consequently large grain size, tend to exhibit the lower strengths.

Tensile tests of notched specimens were performed using a notch
radius of 0.005 in. The notched-to-unnotched strength ratios varied from
1.07 to 1.38 at test temperatures from ambient to 1500°F.

Creep-rupture tests vere performed on sheet and rod specimens in
both air and molten salts. Most of the testing was confined to the
1100 to 1300°F temperature range; however, a few tests were conducted at
temperatures up to 1700°F., Summary curves representing stress vs minimum
creep rate for the MSRE heats of Hastelloy N are shown in Fig. 4. These
data for heat 5055 are plotted to show the time to various strains at
1300°F in Fig. 5. The rupture life of Hastelloy N plotted as a function
of stress is shown in Fig..6. The creep properties in molten-salt

environments were not significantly different from those obtained in air.

Fatigue Properties

Rotating-beam fatigue tests were conducted on Hastelloy N at 1100 and
1300°F by Battelle Memorial Institute.4 Grain size and frequency were the
ma jor variables studied. . The results are shown in Figs. 7 and 8.

The thermal-fatigue behavior of the alloy was investigated at the
University of Alabama. Figure 9 presents a graph of the plastic strain
range Vs cycles to failure . and: the results are seen to obey a Coffin-type
relation. The tests involved several maximum temperatures, as noted, as
well as rapid cycling and hold-time cycling. Furthermore, the data were
obtained from two specimen geometries. ‘These data show good agreement
with isothermal strain-fatigue data on. this alloy.

An. analysis of these same tests, based on a plastic strain energy
criterion, indicates that the total plastic work for failure of Hastelloy N

by fatigue is constant in this temperature range. The data have been

. plotted in Fig. 10 as plastic strain energy vs cycles to failure. It is

seen that the data for 1300 and 1600°F fit curves having the same slope

Np = 1/2) are in fair agreement with plastic strain energy values derived
from tensile tests at the appropriate temperatures.

Effects of Irradiation

Although it has been shown that Hastelloy N has suitable properties
for long-time use at high temperatures, a deterioration of high-temperature
properties occurs in a high neutron-radiation field.” We have found
that Hastelloy N is susceptible to a type of high-temperature irradiation
damage that reduces the creep-rupture life ahd the rupture ductility.

Data from in-reactor creep-rupture tests run on 8. heat of MSRE material

are presented in Fig. 11. The rupture life has been reduced by a factor
of 10 and the rupture ductility to strains of 1 to 3%. There is, however,
an indication that the radiation effect becomes less as the stress levels

are reduced.

~The amount of damage present is a function of the thermal flux and is
essentially independent of fast flux. This supports the hypothesis that
the damage is due to the thermal neutrons with the 1°B transmutation to
lithium and helium thought to be the most probable reaction. The helium
collects in the grain boundaries and promotes the formation of intergranu-

lar cracks, This type of irradiation damage has been found to be quite

“general for iron- and nickel-base structural alloys. 6

Helium may be formed in: Hastelloy N from two sources. The normal

alloys contain 30 to 100 ppm B; and, when exposed to thermal neutrons,

the transmutation of the 10g Just discussed is by far the predominant
source of helium. A second source is the (n,q) reactions ‘of fast neutrons
with nickel, molybdenum, and iron. This source of helium predominates
after all the 1B has been transmuted (requiring a thermal dose of
approximately 102% neutrons/em?) or in materials where the 10p content is

extremely low.

In the reference MSER there is no stressed’ etal in the core and the

‘Hastelloy N is shielded from the core by the breeder blanket. Most of the

neutrons reaching the metal will originate as delayed neutrons that are
born with too low an energy level to produce the fast neutron reactions.
Therefore, the best way to reduce the amount of helium in the metal is to
reduce the boron content, . |

_ The main source of boron in commercial alloys 1s the, melting crucible,

and we have found that with reasonable care commercial heats can be prepared

with boron in the range 1-5 ppm. However; the properties of irradiated
"metal of this low boron content are no better than those of metal containing
50 ppm B; indicating that the. threshold helium levels necessary for damage

can be ‘produced in metal containing ‘below 1 ppm B. - Hence, it appears that

 Feducing the boron level alone is not an adequate solution to the problem.

We have found that the resistance of Hastelloy N to irradiation
damage can be improved by slight changes in chemical composition, A

“reduction in the molybdenum content seems desirable to prevent the forma-

tion of massive MC in the alloy. Figure 12 shows ‘the simpler micro-

~ structure of the alloy containing 129 Mo. Further increases in the

molybdenum content result in the formation of the molybdenum-rich MgC and
have little effect on strength. The addition of small amounts (approx
0.5 wt %) of Ti, zr, and Hf reduces the irradiation demage problem signif-
icantly. Figure 13 illustrates the fact that several alloys have been
developed with properties after irradiation that are superior to those of
unirradiated standard Hastelloy N. We are beginning work to optimize the
compositions and heat treatments for these alloys. We are also initiating
the procurement of 1500 1b commercial melts of some of the more attractive
compositions.

The ex-reactor properties of the modified Hastelloy N seem very

attractive. Strengths are slightly better than standard Hastelloy N and

fracture ductilities are about double. The weldability of the titanium-
and hafnium-bearing ‘alloys appears excellent; however, we realize that

welds need to be made under ‘higher restraint and in larger sections than

mental to the weldability with extensive weld metal cracking resulting. oo
Thus we feel that the further development of the zirconiun-bearing alloy

must await the development of a suitable filler metal.

Corrosion by Molten Fluoride Salts

A unique feature of the molten-salt .type reactors is the circulation
of molten salts both as the fuel and the coolant media. The salts being
“used are mixtures of metal fluorides. Essentially no experience is
available from industry on handling such salt mixtures at the proposed
temperatures, but much information has been produced at ORNL.
Studies on molten fluoride mixtures for reactor applications began
in(the early 1950's and gave primary consideration to the compatibility
of these salt mixtures with structural materials. In the intervening
15 years, an extensive corrosion program has been conducted at ORNL with -
several families of fluoride mixtures using both commercial and develop-
mental high-temperature alloys.”’—15 As a consequence, the corrosion :

technology for the molten-salt reactor concept is naw in an advanced stage
of development. Furthermore, container materials are available that have

shown extremely low corrosion rates in fluoride mixtures at temperatures

considerably above the 1000 40 1300°F range proposed for the MSER.

Unlike more conventional oxidizing media, the products of oxidation
of metals by molten fluorides tend to be completely soluble in the cor-
roding media; hence, passivation is precluded, and corrosion depends
directly on the thermodynamic driving force of the corrosion reactions.
Design of a chemically stable system utilizing fluoride salts, therefore,
requires the selection of salt constituents that are not appreciably
reduced by available structural metals and the development of containers
whose components are in near thermodynamic equilibrium with the salt
medium. In practical applications, the major source of corrosion by
fluoride mixtures has derived from trace impurities in the melt rather
than the major salt constituents. These impurities may originate within
the melt or from oxide films or other contaminants on’ the metal surface.
Further details concerning corrosion mechanisms in fluoride melts have been
presented previously. l? C

Corrosion data on Hastelloy N in LAF- -BeFy ‘based salts have been
generated in out-of-reactor thermal- and forced -convection loops, in-

reactor capsules, and more recently the MSRE.

Loop Studies
The original studies that serve as a vase for the 'MSBR corrosion

studies were conducted at ORNL as. part of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion
Project. 7-13 Work on this project. was aimed at a 1500°F maximum tempera-

ture. Nickel alloys’ were shown 10 be the most promising for containing

the fluorides; however, strength considerations restricted the candidate

“materials to the commercial nickel-chromium group, with Inconel 600

‘receiving the most attention. ‘These alloys incurred corrosion by selective

oxidation of chromium through trace impurities and by mass transfer of

chromium through a redox reaction involving UF. Corrosion was in the

form of subsurface voids with the depth proportional to the test time

and temperature.

 
 

 

20

Using information gained in corrosion testing of the commercial "
alloys and from fundamental interpretations of the corrosion process, an
alloy was developed at ORNL to provide improved corrosion resistance as
well as acceptable mechanical properties. The alloy system. used as the
basis for this development was composed of nickel with a primary strength-
ening addition of 15 to 20% Mo. Evaluations of other strengthening addi-
tions culminated in the selection of an alloy containing 16% Mo, 7% Cr,
and 4% Fe (INOR-8, now Hastelloy N).
The corrosion testing program for Hastelloy N involved three sequential
phases. In the first phase, the corrosion properties of 13 fluoride salt
mixtures were compared in Hastelloy N thermal-convection loops operated
for 1000 hr. Specific salt mixtures, whose compositions are listed in
Table 4, were selected to provide an evaluation of (1) the corrosion
properties of beryllium-bearing fuels, (2) the corrosion properties of
beryllium-fluoride mixtures containing large quantities of thorium, and )
(3) the corrosion properties of nonfuel-bearing fluoride coolant salts. .
The second phase of testing, which again used thermal-convection loops,
involved more extensive investigations for longer time periods and at v
two temperature levels. The third phase of the testing was conducted in
forced-circulation loops at flow rates and temperature conditions simu-
lating those of an operating reactor system. . These loops operated with
maximum fuel-salt temperatures of 1250 to 1500°F, maximm coolant-salt
temperatures of 1050 to 1200°F, and all with approximately 200°F tempera-
ture drops. ‘A total of 49 thermal loops and 15 forced-circulation loops
were operated during these phases of the program. | |
Essentially no attack or deposition was found with any of the
fluorides in Hastelloy N loops in the phase-I studies, The maximum
attack found after 8760 hr in the phase-II tests was a limited surface
‘roughening and pitting to a depth of 1/2 mil. Attack in most cases was
accompanied by a thin surface layer. ‘The typical appearance of a hot-
leg surface is shown in Fig. La. No deposit or other evidence of mass
transfer was found in any of the cold legs.
In the third phase of the . program, employing forced-convection loops, -

mation about the weight losses occurring during the tests. Salt samples |

Although most of our work was with Hastelloy N, we looked at the

behavior of several nickel-base alloys with variations of the Hastelloy N
composition. 16 Several alloys were screened by thermal-convection loop
tests at 1500°F in salt 107 (composition given in Table 7). The composi-

Chromium increases the corrosion rate significantly. With chromium present,

the addition of about 2 at. % Ti does not appear to increase the corrosion

The MSRE initially underwent a series of zero- and low-power tests.

“The chemical analyses of the MSRE fuel and coolant salts showed very little
- change, indicating a low corrosion rate of the Hastelloy N and negligible
"transfer of impurities from the graphite to the salt. This vas substanti-

ated by the examination of graphite and metal specimens after the initial
tests. SE

The full- power opStation of the reactor began in March 1965. The
first group of metal and graphite surveillance specimens was removed in
July 1966 after exposure to “the reactor core environment for 7612 Mwhr
which included a thermal exposure of 4800 hr at 1200°F. The peak thermal
dose was 1.3 X 1020 neutrons/cm? and the peak fast dose >1.2 Mev was

increased from an initial value of 37 to 48 ppm where it remained fairly
steady during the 7612 Mwhr run. The iron and nickel concentrations
remained constant at values of 10 and 1 ppm, respectively. Visual exam-
ination indicated the metal and graphite specimens to be in excellent
condition. Machining marks were quite visible on the graphite specimens,
Several of the graphite and metal specimens were given to the Reactor
Chemistry Division for analysis with respect to fission product content. 1?

At temperatures above 932°F, the ductility of the irradiated and the

material showing a greater loss in ductility. At temperatures above
1202 to 1292°F, the control material exhibited improved ductility, whereas

the ductility of the irradiated material continued to decrease.

from the MSRE had properties very similar to ‘those observed for specimens
irradiated to comparable doses in the ORR. Co
The - most important. question to be answered concerning. these data is

how they apply to the operation of the MSRE.

The surveillance specimens were. exposed to a thermal dose of
1.3% 1020 neutrons/cn?, (The MSRE vessel will reach this dose after

~ about 150,000 Mwhr. of operation, ) This burned out about 30% of the 1°

and produced a helium content of about 10™3 atom fraction in both heats.
The high-temperature tensile and creep-rupture properties are exactly what
we would expect for this dose. Our work indicates a saturation in the

degree of radiation damage at a helium atom fraction of about 10-2 and we

feel that the properties of the material will not deteriorate further.
The low-temperature ductility reduction was not expected. It is thought
to be a result of grain-boundary precipitates forming due to the long
thermal exposure. - Irradiation ‘plays some role in this process that is yet
undefined. The low-temperature properties are not "brittle" by any stan-
dards, but will be monitored closely when future sets of surveillance
specimens are removed.

The MSRE has since operated for a total of approximately 32,500 Mwhr.
The chromium. content - of the salt has been somewhat higher during this run
at approximately 60 ppm. “We: removed. a group of surveillance specimens
(graphite and Hastelloy N) for study ‘about May 15, 1967. The Hastelloy N
removed was of the modified: “type, with small additions of titanium and
zirconium. The graphite and metal specimens will be evaluated with respect

to “corrosion, metallographic changes, mechanical properties, and fission

product absorption. :
Resistance to Gaseous Contaminants CE

Oxidation Resistance

The oxidation resistance of nickel-molybdenum alloys depends on the

service temperature, the temperature cycle, the molybdenum content, and

the chromium content. The oxidation rate of the binary nickel-molybdenum
alloy passes through a maximum for the alloy containing 15% Mo, and the
scale formed by the oxidation is NiMoO; and NiO. Upon thermal cycling

 
 

32

from above 1400°F to below 660°F, the NiMoO, undergoes a phase transfor-
mation that causes the protective scale on the oxidized metal to spall.
Subsequent temperature cycles then result in an accelerated oxidation
rate. Similarly, the oxidation rate of nickel-molybdenum alloys contain-
ing chromium. passes through a maximum as the chromium content of the
alloys is increased from 2 to 6% Cr. : Alloys containing more than 6% Cr
are insensitive to thermal cycling and to the molybdenum content because
the oxide scale is predominantly stable Cr,0;3. An abrupt ‘decrease (by a
factor of about 40) in the oxidation rate at 1800°F is observed when the
chromium content is increased from 5.9 to 6.2%. oo

The oxidation resistance of Hastelloy N is excellent, and continuous
~ operation at temperatures up to 1800°F is feasible. Intermittent use at
temperatures as high as 1900°F could be tolerated. ‘For temperatures up
to 1200°F, the oxidation rate is not measurable; it is essentially zero
after 1000 hr of exposure in static air; as well as in nitrogen containing
small quantities of air (the MSRE cell environment). It is estimated
that oxidation of 0.001 to 0.002 in. would occur in 100,000 hr of opera-
tion at 1200°F. The effect of temperature on the oxidation rate of the
alloy is shown in Fig. 21. Co oo

Resistance to Nitriding

 

Hastelloy N does not react noticeably with nitrogen at temperatures
up to 2200°F in the absence of irradiation. However, in a neutron
enviroment, the nitrogen is dissociated and some shallow surface reac-
tion (a few mils) is encountered. Although only limited data are avail-
able, there appears to be a considerable variation in the depth of such
layers with various lots of material. While such layers are not thick
enough in themselves to affect the strength of the proposed components,
they are brittle and crack easily, so that they could possibly act as

stress risers.

Compatibility with Superheated Steam

 

In parts of the system Hastelloy N will be exposed to supercritical
steam having a maximum temperature of 1050°F and a pressure of 3800 psi.
Some heat exchange equipment will have coolant salt on one side and steam

on the other side. Because of the higher pressure of the steam, a failure
in the Hastelloy N would result in steam being forced into the coolant-
salt circuit. Thus, we cannot adopt the "cheap material and frequent
maintenance” policy of the power industry. The stress-corrosion type of
failure in boiling water and in superheated steam systems has been observed
for the austenitic stainless steels in several nuclear systems.19720 The
resistance of high-nickel alloys to this type of attack has also been
established and it seems reasonable that our system should utilize such an
alloy. 19,20

_ Hastelloy N has been included in steam-metal compatibility programs
at BNWL,?1222 gang some of the results of these studies are summarized in
Table 8. Hastelloy N exhibited much better resistance to corrosion by
steam than type 304L stainless steel. It also compared very favorably
with the other nickel-base alloys that were included in these evaluation
programs (e.g., Hastelloy X, Inconel 600, and Incoloy 800). Although the
depth of attack varied slightly with steam pressure and oxygen content, a
rather pessimistic value for the corrosion rate is about 0.1 mil attack
in 2400 hr. Assuming a linear rate of attack, which again is on the pessi-
mistic side, the depth of attack in 20 years would be about 7 mils.
Assuming the more realistic parabolic behavior, the expected depth of
attack would be only 0.8 mil. Either of these values is quite acceptable
and we feel that Hastelloy N is a very attractive material for use in the

steam circuit.

Fabrication of Hastelloy N Systems and Components

The fact that Hastelloy N is a material from which a complicated
reactor system may be constructed has been demonstrated by the successful
construction and operation of the MSRE. Evidence of its general recog-
nition by industry is demonstrated by its acceptance and approval by the.
ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.

Raw Material Fabrication

Hastelloy N has proven to be readily fabricable into the many raw
material forms (pipe, tube, plate, bar, castings, etc.) required in the
fabrication of a complex engineering system such as a nuclear reactor.
Fabrication of the various raw material items required for the MSRE was
by normal commercial sources. Forming techniques developed for austen-
itic stainless steels can usually be used for Hastelloy N with a small
increase in temperature. :

Melting and casting is carried out by using conventional practices
for nickel and its alloys. Ingots for the MSRE were prepared by both
air- and vacuum-induction or consumable arc melting. Individual melts up
to 10,000 1b and a total quantity of almost 200,000 1b were produced.
Castings have been made in molds of water-cooled copper, graphite, rammed
magnesia, cast iron, and sand. While castings are considerably weaker
than wrought metal at room temperature, they are slightly stronger at
MSBR operating temperatures. It is easier to control the chemical anal-
ysis by vacuum melting and the metal has better mechanical properties
and fabricability. Vacuum melting has become a common commercial practice
during the last few years, and this melting practice will probably be used
in preference to air melting in the future for nuclear grade materials.

In making the many different forms and sizes of material required
during the development and construction of the MSRE, Hastelloy N was fab-
ricated using the normal techniques for nickel-base alloys. The initial
fabrication or breaking down of the ingots was accomplished by forging.
or extrusion. Temperatures varied from 1825 to 2250°F. Secondary fabri-
~cation was accomplished hot and cold. Acceptable techniques included
rolling, swaging, tube reducing, and drawing. The alloy work hardens

wh
 

 

 

 

 

37

vhen fabricated cold, but reductions in area of up to 50% are possible
between anneals. Temperatures of 2100 to 2200°F are used for hot rolling
“with reductions of about 10% per pass.
~The standard finished annealing temperature for this alloy is 2150°F.
~All material for the MSRE was annealed after forming or working. After
final fabrication, all material was. stress relieved at 1600°F. For any
heat treatment the cooling rate to 600°F was limited to 400°F per hour
per inch of thickness. The slow cooling helped to impart dimensional
stability and improved the ductility in the 1400 to 1800°F range.
A necessary adjunct of fabrication is an inspection to demonstrate
the acceptance of the product. Products fabricated from Hastelloy N
may be inspected with the same nondestructive testing procedures used
for other high-nickel alloys or austenitic stainless steels. Tubing and
pipe received for the MSRE were inspected using liquid penetrants, eddy

currents, and ultrasonic techniques.
Welding and Brazing of Hastelloy N

Extensive experience with Hastelloy N has shown that it exhibits
relatively good weldability. The MSRE contains literally hundreds of
satisfactory tungsten-arc welds in varied section sizes. The welds were
made using procedures developed at ORNL for nuclear-quality applications.
The subsequent inspection of these welds showed that they met the very
tight ORNL requirements.

Hastelloy N has also ‘been shown to be: readily brazesble. Good
wetting and flow have been demonstrated using comercially available
brazing. alloys and conventional brazing ‘techniques.

During the course of ‘the investigation of the weldsbility of
Hastelloy N, welding problems vere ‘encountered. Hot cracking of the type
“occasionally encountered in welding high-nickel alloys was sometimes
“observed in heavily restrained Joints both in experimental heats and in

_ later commercial heats. In. some of these unacceptable heats, the cause
~of cracking was. established as ‘high ‘boron content; ‘however, certain lower

boron heats were still crack-sensitive for unknown reasons. Although the

exact cause of the trouble was never established, indications were that

 
 

38

.it was associated with the proprietary melting practice used by the manu-
facturer. The impurity specifications were relaxed slightly, the melting
practice was revised, and weldable heats were produced. | |

Although these changes upgraded the quality of the commercial pro-
ducts they did not assure the complete elimination of the propensity
toward cracking. A crack test was conceived and used as the basis for
segregating unsatisfactory heats. Since the effects of processing vari-
ables and impurity levels on welding were not determined, the weldabil-
ity of a particular heat had to be determined by a test weld. Conse-
quently, metallurgical studies aimed at understanding the basic reasons
for cracking and eventually reaching a more permanent solution were ini-
tiated. Cracking was shown to be associated with the segregation of
alloying elements in the heat-affected zone of Hastelloy N weldments. 23
Figure 22 shows the microstructural changes that can occur as a result
of welding; microprobe analyses of these samples showed that the brittle
eutectic-type structure had a markedly different composition from that
of the matrix. |

To date, the gas tungsten-arc welding process is the only technique
that has been used for the construction of reactors of this material,

The MSRE experience has proven the applicability of this process. The -
weld filler metal used for joining Hastelloy N has been of the same
basic composition as the wrought product.

The room-temperature mechanical properties of Hastelloy N weldments
have been extensively investigated. In the course of qualifying welding
procedures for this alloy in accordance with the ASME Boiler and Pressure
Vessel Code, numerous bend and tensile tests were conducted. The results
readily satisfied the Code requirements. However, as was expected, the
ductilities of the welds were not as good as those obtained for the base
metal. Elevated-temperature studies of welds24,25 showed that they had

lower ductility and creep-rupture strength than the base metal. However,
stress relieving at 1600°F improved the properties to where they were
comparable with those of the base metal.

The room- and elevated-temperature shear strengths of Hastelloy N
joints brazed with Au-18% Ni filler metal have also been determined. 26
Joints tested at room temperature had an average shear strength of
73,000 psi, while those tested at 1300°F possessed an average strength
of 18,000 psi. Diffusion and microhardness studies of aged brazed joints
showed that they possessed excellent microstructural stability.

Joining for Reactor Component Fabrication

Pressure Vessel and Piping

As mentioned previously, only weldable heats of Hastelloy N were
used for the MSRE application. The tungsten-arc welding process, with
filler metal additions, was used throughout, and the fabrication was
carried out without undue difficulty. All welding was done in accor-
dance with ORNL-approved specifications by qualified operators. The
finished product readily met the strict ORNL requirements for nuclear

systems.

Heat Exchangers

The production of reliable tube-to-header Joints for heat exchange
applications in molten-salt systems is mandatory. One means of assuring
this reliability, welding and back-brazing, was successfully developed
and tested extensively under severe operating conditions for the
Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Project.2? The technique was further
improved and adapted for use in the fabrication of the primary heat

Dissimilar Metal Joints
The incorporation of a variety of components in a reactor system
frequently requires the use of dissimilar metal welds. Welding proce-

dures have been developed for joining Hastelloy N to several different
materials, including Inconel 600, austenitic stainless steels, and nickel.

Remote Joining

Molten-salt reactors have the characteristic that the fuel circulates
through much of the external piping system. During operation, residual
activity is imparted to the walls, and during draining some fuel always
remains either in the crevices or by sticking to the wall. The resulting
redioactivity requires that remote maintenance procedures be used, and

they include remote joining.

Remote Welding

While many remote joining methods have been developed for the nuclear
industry, they were always for special applications such as replacing the
seal weld on a vessel, or making a closure weld for a capsule or a fuel
element. ?® Commercial equipment is not generally availsble for such
applications. The nearest approaches to ‘developed remote maintenance
systems for a large reactor were one designed and partially developed by
Westinghouse Electric Corporation, Atomic Power Department, for use with
the proposed Pennsylvania Advanced Reactor,30 and one at Atomics

International for use with a large sodium graphite reactor.31 However,

these projects were terminated before the developed techniques could be

demonstrated. Included were techniques for plugging heat exchanger tubes
and for butt welding of pressure piping.

The practicality of remote operations has been improved by the
recent rapid advances in the automatic welding field aimed at the nuclear
and aerospace industries; an excellent example of an automated machine is
the one developed for welding the HFIR fuel elements. The only function

‘of the operator is to position the torch and to press the start button;

both of these operations could also be done automatically if desirable.

Brazing and Mechanical Joints

 

Studies on remote joining have also included brazing and mechanical
Joining techniques. Standard ring joint flanges were used at high pres-
sures but lower temperatures in the Hamogeneous Reactor Experiment.
Freeze flanges are used to join the major pieces of equipment in the
MSRE. Similar developments have been made for other reactors and for
fuel reprocessing plants. In all cases the joints were developed for
use in smaller pipes than are being proposed for the MSBR. The principal

deterrent to the use of mechanical joints is the difficulty in repeatedly

assuring a seal, particularly in high-temperature cyclic service.

Equipment was developed and tested for remotely cutting and brazing
the drain line and the salt piping in the drain tank cell of the MSRE,
The piping is standard 1 1/2-in. sched-40 pipe. These joints were -
carefully inspected and were determined to be of high quality.

Remote Inspection

A necessary accompaniment of remote welding must be a remote inspec-
‘tion. Less development has been done on inspection than on welding.
Sufficient work has been done at ORNL to show that such operations are
feasible and the required techniques should be possible with a limited
development program.

Ultrasonic techniques along with remote positioning equipment were
developed and used for the remote measurement of the wall thickness of
the Homogeneous Reactor Test core vessel.?2 The precision of measurement
was approximately 1%.

~ Ultrasonic and radiographic techniques were developed but not tried
for the remote inspection of the EGCR through-tube weldments. 33

STATUS OF DEVELORMENT OF GRAPHITE

In the proposed MSER, graphite is used in the core as a pipe mate-

‘rial for separating the fuel and blanket salts and also for moderator

blocks around the tubes. The former is the wore critical use. The
graphite in the tubes must have low. permeabllity to salt and must be free
from flaws that would permit appreciable seepage of salt between the

“fuel and blanket streams. A’ value" for the permeability to gases has not

been specified yet but a very low one is desirable to minimize the rate
of diffusion of xenon into the graphite and thereby minimize the loss of
neutrons to *>5Xe, ‘Although high strength is desirable, it need not be
higher than has already been obtained readily. Techniques are required
for joining graphite to graphite and graphite to metals. Finally the
graphite in the MSBR will be irradiated to a dose as high as

2 x 1022 neutrons/ cm? (E > 0.18 Mev) per year and the tubes must perform
satisfactorily at this irradiation level for at least three and possibly
five years to have & practical power reactor.

Graphites have been used for many ‘Years as. the moderator in a
variety of power and plutonium production reactors where the require-
ments are less severe and the radiation levels are much lower. The type
CGB graphite used in the MSRE approaches the requirements of the MSER -
but the MSRE is not & two-fluid system and is less demanding. Loosely

‘assembled bars were used, small cracks were not serious faults, and the

radiation levels were almost two orders of magnitude lower than those in

"the MSBR. Some of the never isotropic graphites promise greater stability

those materials to satisfy other requirements imposed by the use .of molten- v
salt fuels could result in a better graphite for use in the breeder resac-
tors. Extrapolation of existing data indicates that the life will probably

be adequate.

Grade CGB Graphite

_ Grade CGB graphite was designed for use in molten-salt reactors and
was first made in commercial quantities for the MSRE. It is basically
a petroleum needle coke that is bonded with coal-tar pitch, extruded to
rough shape, and heated to 5072°F. Improved dimensional stability under
irradiation is ensured by not using amorphous carbon materials such as
carbon black in the base stock. High density and low permeation are
achieved through multiple impregnations and heat treatments. All compo-
nents are fired to 5072°F or higher. ‘The product is essentially a well-
graphitized material and is highly anisotropic. Its properties are
tabulated in Table 9. So co LRRD
Grade CGB graphite represents significant progress in the. develop- .
ment of a low-permeability radiation-resistant graphite. Experiments
bave demonstrated that the multiple impregnations required to obtain the
low permeability and small open-pore size do not appreclably alter the
dimensional stability compared to conventional needle-coke graphites.
In manufacturing the material for the MSRE,. experimentel equipment
and processes were used on a comercial scale for the first time by “the
Carbon Products Division of Union Carbide Corporation to produce bars
2.50 in. square and 72 in. long which were machined to the shapes:
required for the MSRE.. The bars were the largest that could be produced
by the then-current technology to meet the requirements of low permeabil-
ity to salt and gases and resistance to radiation effects. Assembly of
the MSRE core from bars of the graphite is shown in Fig. 25. fe

Permeability

Some of the more stringent specifications on graphite for MSBR will
be on ‘permeability. 40 values will be specified for permeability to both -
molten salts and to helium. The screening test for salt permeability is
to expose evacuated specinens for 100 hr to molten salt at 1300°F under
ga pressure of 150 psig. The MSRE design specifications required that

less than 0.5% of the bulk volume of the graphite should be filled with

salt and that the salt should not penetrate the graphite matrix. Speci-
mens of grade CGB had an average of less than’ 0.2% of their bulk volume |
permeated by salt in these screening tests, and the salt distribution
was limited to shallow. penetrations at the. ‘surfaces and. along cracks
which intersected the exterior surfaces. - The salt: that entered the

cracks was confined to the cracks and, as shown in Fig. 217, did not

_ permeate the matrix. The rerméation characteristics of the graphite as

determined by test should be representative since irradiation does not
appear to change the wetting: characteristics of the salt and the screening
pressures are three times the maximum design pressure for the MSRE core.
The limit on gas permeability ‘has played a major role in establishing
the fabrication sequence for the graphite. Low permeability to gases is
desirable to prevent gaseous fission products from entering the graphite.
We would like a graphite for the MSER with a helium permeability of
10-7 cm?/sec. While it has been possible to obtain graphites meeting the
salt-permeablility requirements, it has not been possible to reduce the

gas ‘permeability to the 1077 level. . Crack-free CGB graphite in the MSRE
exhibited average helium permeability values of 3 X 10% cm?/sec. As
previously discussed, this’ ‘graphite was fabricated using special proce-
. dures aimed at low porosity. The graphite tubes for MSBR will have much

thinner cross sections and. should . be less permeable. At present, it

would appear that values of 10-5 em?/sec would be about all that can be
produced by present technology. ‘Experimental and other special graphite
Pipes have been produced with permeabilities less than 10-6 cn?/sec

 

“Ofelium is a convenient medivn to use for quality control to
establish permeability limits to gaseous fission products.

(refs. 41, 42). ‘The latter contained carbon black in the base stock which
would significantly decrease its dimensional stability under radiation.
The former had amorphous carbon impregnants, but this appears to cause
only slight decrease in its dimensional stability under irradiation. 43
While a homogeneous graphite is desirable, one with a surface seal
must also be considered. Such a seal may be a penetrating, integral
skin of graphite or a thin coating of 92M0 or Nb. The metallic coatings
would be applied by deposition from the metal chloride gas at elevated
temperatures. The surface coating would be quite thin (approx 0.0001 in.)
but would be applied under conditions where the metal would be linked into

the pore structure so that good adherence would be ensured.

Mechanical Properties

 

The tensile and flexural strength measurements on grade CGB graphite
for the MSRE averaged 1900 and 4300 psi, respectively, despite the pres-
ence of cracks in the graphite. There were no values less than the
minima of 1500 and 3000 psi specified for the tensile and flexural
strengths, respectively. These strength values were specified primarily
to assure a good quality of graphite, The stresses expected in the
reactor are very low in the absence of irradiation. However, under fast-
neutron irradiation, “the differences in shrinkage rates across the 1/2- -in,
wall of a pipe caused by flux gradients can produce high stresses.

The tensile strength of. the MSRE ‘graphite is shown in Fig. 28. The
band with the single cross-hatching indicates the stress- strain ‘behavior

of the material. However, some - of the material contained cracks and

failure occurred at lower stresses and strains as indicated by the solid
points. The crack- free material, represented by the solid points, failed

“at higher stresses. Specimens that demonstrated definite effects of

cracks (the black points) ‘had a ‘minimum strength of 1510 pei and an average

strength of 2940 psi. Specimens that were not appreciably affected

by cracks (the open circles) yielded an average strength of 5440 psi and

a modulus of elasticity of 3.2 x 108 psi, corresponding to an unususlly

a single bar (No. 45); however, there was also some variation between
various bars. The double cross-hatched portion indicates the overall
range of properties obtained by sampling various bars of the MSRE graphite.

Isotropic Graphite

There has been recent progress in the development of isotropic
grades of graphite that offer greater dimensional stability under irra-
diation and potentially can be used as a base for the impregnations to
obtain the necessary low permeability. Development of this material |
has occurred in the last few years and much of the data are pedpeistary:
and have not been released for publication. However, properties of

some available grades are listed in Table 10.

The isotropic graphite is made in various shapes with conventional
carbon and graphite molding and extruding equipment. Bulk densities can
range from < 1.40 to 1.90 g/cm®. The strengths of various grades tend
to exceed those of grades of conventional, anisotropic graphite.

Past work has not been directed toward producing isotropic graphite
with the low permeabilities required for molten-salt breeder reactors.
Pipes of grade H-315-A (Table 10) have been made that are approximately
4.5 in. in diameter with 0.50-in.-wall thickness which would correspond
to the large MSBR pipes. These pipes had an average bulk density of
1.83 g/cm3 and radially they had a permeability to helium of 2 x 10-3
to 1 x 1072 cm?/sec. The lower value refers to the unmachined pipe and
the higher value to pieces machined from the pipe walls. Pore spectrum
measurements indicated that approximately 50% of the pore volume had
pore entrance diameters between 0.5 and 3.5 p and less ‘than 15% of the
pore volume had pore entrance diameters > 3.5 pu. This pore spectrum
suggests that this material, although it was not designed for it, might
be suitable base stock to impregnate to produce low-permeability graphite.
Of course, in fabricating graphite for MSBR use one would want to opti-
mize the base stock for impregnation which would mean that the base
stock would be fabricated with pore entrances less than 1 p in diameter.

In the following program, the isotropic graphite will be considered
as the reference material. However, until its development has proceeded
to the point that meeting the MSBR requirements is reasonably assured,
it will be necessary to continue the development of the anisotropic
needle-coke graphite as backup material. Most of the data obtained to
date have been with needle-coke graphite; however, much of this
technology is transferable to the isotropic graphite.

Joining

The MSBR is unique among reactors in that it uses graphite as an
engineering material and the present conceptual design calls for graphite-
to-graphite and graphite-to-Hastelloy N joints. 44 These joints are on

the core pieces but in a region where the neutron flux dose is reduced
considerably. With all the tons of graphite that have been used in
nuclear reactors, most of the work on graphite-to-metal Joining seems to

have been done in small L programs at ORNLA%:46 and Atomics International.

Graph te-to-Hastelloy 'N Joints

Only a few brazing alloys are suitable for brazing graphite for
molten-salt service, since, in addition to wetting ability, the braze
material must be corrosion resistant and stable under irradiation. To
promote bonding, some chemical reaction with the graphite is desirable;
therefore, most proposed graphite brazes contain some "active" metal.
However, titanium and zirconium - the two usually proposed — may not be

suitable as far as corrosion resistance to molten fluoride salts is con-

~ cerned. Similar statements can be made about alloys containing large

quantities of chromium. Thus, brazing development in support of molten-
salt concepts has been concerned with developing an alloy that not only
will braze graphite but also will be corrosion resistant, melt high
enough to: be strong in use but low enough to be brazed with conventional
vacuum or inert-atmosphere equipment, and be stable under irradiation.

The Jow coefficient of thermal expansion and low tensile strength
of the graphite may make 1t difficult to join it directly to the

‘Hastelloy N or other structural materials, The problem is further com-

plicated by - ‘the ‘respective shrinkage and expansion expected in the
graphite as it is exposed to- the fast neutrons.

Two of several approaches are receiving the greatest study at this
time. - One is to braze the Hastelloy N to the graphite in such a way

that the Hastelloy N applies ‘a compressive loading to the graphite as

the Joint is cooled from the brazing ‘temperature. This. is desirable
since graphite is ‘stronger and more ductile in compression: than in
tension. The other approach is: to ‘join the graphite to materials that
have coefficients of ‘thermal expansion approaching or equal to that of

the graphite. These transition materials would, in turn, be joined to
the Hastelloy N by brazing. Therefore, refractory metals, such as
molybdenum and tungsten, which have thermal expansion coefficients more
closely matched to graphite as well as much higher strengths, have been
selected as promising transition materials.

The joint utilizing the refractory metal transition piece has
received considerable attention. The ductile and corrosion-resistant
alloy, 82% Au-18% Ni, was chosen as & starting point for molten-salt
applications. To this base material has been added the corrosion-
resistant, strong carbide formers, molybdenum and tantalum. As a result,
alloys in both the Au-Ni-Mo and Au-Ni-Ta systems were developed“3 which
fulfilled the above requirements with the possible exception of nuclear
stability in a high neutron flux (gold will transmute to mercury in nigh
flux fields). The most promising alloy contains 35 Au-35 Ni-30 Mo
(wt %) and has been designated as ANM-16. Graphite-to-graphite and
graphite-to-molybdenum joints have been made with ANM-16 by induction

brazing in an inert atmosphere and vacuum brazing in.a muffle furnace,

 

A brazing temperature of 2282 to 2372°F was used. Several components
have been brazed with this alloy, the largest of which have been
1.50-in. OD X 0.31-in.-wall graphite pipes with molybdenum .end caps and
sleeves. Joints of this type as well as T-joints have been examined
metallographically and found to be sound in all cases.

If brazing conditions are controlled closely, the joints appear
sound in all respects. However, if the assembly is maintained at brazing:

 

temperature longer than necessary or if too high a brazing temperature

is used, the alloy in the fillet spreads onto the surface of the graphite
in a very thin layer. Upon cooling from the brazing temperature, this
thin layer will crack. This behavior is aggravated when the surface of
the graphite is smooth and free of porosity, such as with the desired
MSBR graphite. Joints made with high-density CEY graphite pipe exhibited
this behavior, whereas it had not been noticed when brazing the very

porous grades such as AGOT. Metallographic examination, however, shows

that the cracks do not extend into the body of the fillet.

A short section of graphite pipe with a brazed graphite-to-metal
end closure successfully contained molten salts for 500 hr at 1292°F and
a pressure of 150 psig. The graphite pipe was machined to
1.25-in. OD X 0.75-in. ID from a bar of MSRE graphite. Molybdenum end
caps were brazed to the ends of the pipe using braze metal ANM-16. No
leak occurred during the 500-hr test period, and posttest radiographic
examination indicated that the salt was contained as planned. Metallo-
graphic examination revealed no penetration of salt into the graphite
and no detectable corrosion of the braze material.

Recently, an alloy ‘without gold has been developed to .overcome the
possible problems of transmutation. This alloy has a composition of
35% Ni-60% Pi—5% Cr and has exhibited brazing characteristics very much
like the 35% Au-35% Ni-30% Mo alloy. The chromium content was kept low
in the hope that acceptable corrosion resistance would be obtained. The
brazing alloy wet both materials and appeared to form a joint as good as
that obtained with ANM-16.

Joints of graphite to molybdenum have been brazed with this alloy
and survived a 1300°F corrosion test (LiF-BeF-ZrF,-ThF;-UF,) of
10,000 hr with no attack. There was a thin palladium-rich layer on the
surface Of the brazing alloy. -A 20,000-hr corrosion test has accumulated
10,700 hr to date. Chromium, the carbide former, may be tied up in the
form of a corrosion-resistant carbide, Cr3C,, to such an extent that the
chromium will not cause a corrosion problem. 47

To date, no mechanical property tests have been run on brazed
graphite joints at ORNL but graphite-to-molybdenun specimens ‘brazed with
the 35% Ni-60% Pd—5% Cr alloy have successfully withstood ten thermal
cycles from 1300° F to. ambient. Metallographic examination revealed no
cracks arter this test. ’

Graphite-to-Graphite Joints

Low

Techniques are camercially available for joining graphite to
itself.4® Most techniques are based on the use of furfural alcohol and
graphite powder. The mechanism of sealing is by polymerization of the
alcohol at temperatures to 1600°F. The joint must be held under pressure
during the curing to prevent gross porosity. The porosity arises from
the gas that must escape during curing. It may be minimized by close
joint fitups and slow heating rates. The polymerization would be followed
by a graphitizing treatment at about 4892°F. However, it may be more
desirable to use & metallic brazing alloy to obtain a Joint with lover
permeability and higher strength. Small graphite-to-graphite Joints have

been made at ORNL using the Au-Ni-Mo and Au-Ni-Ta brazing alloys; however,
| such joints were most effective when graphite that was much more porous
than the CGB grade was ‘used. Several other alloys are being ‘investigated
that wet the graphite and are resistant to corrosion by fused salts.

Compatibility of Graphite with Molten Salts

Since the MSBR uses graphite in direct contact with the molten-salt
fuel and the breeder blanket, good compatibility between graphite and
Hastelloy N in these molten fluorides is needed. Tests performed have
indicated that excellent compatibility exists. The tendency for
Hastelloy N to be carburized was investigated in static pots containing
LiF-BeF,-UF; (67-32—1 mole ¥) and a graphite at 1300°F for times ranging
from 2000 to 12,000 hr. No carburization was metallographically detected
on specimens from any of the above tests. 4? Tensile properties were
determined on specimens included in each test. A comparison of the
tensile strengths and elongation values of the tested specimens with
those of the control specimens indicated that no significant change

occurred in the test specimens.

For the purpose of evaluating the compatibility of graphite and |

Hastelloy N in a circulating fluoride fuel, a Hastelloy N forced-

convection loop was operated for 8850 hr. The loop operated at a maxi-

. mum temperature of 1300°F and circulated a fluoride mixture of
IiF-BeF,-UF,. On completion of the test, components from the loop were

checked metallographically and ‘chemically, and specimens were checked
for dimensional changes and weight changes. The tests indicated that
(1) there was no corrosion or erosion of the graphite by the flowing
salt; (2) there was very little permeation of the graphite by the salt
and the permeation that occurred was uniform throughout the graphite
rods; (3) the various Hastelloy N loop components exposed to the salt
were not carburized; (4) the Hastelloy N components exposed to the salt
and graphite were negligibly attacked; and (5) with the possible excep-
tion of oxygen contamination, the salt appeared to have undergone no
chemical changes as & result of exposure to the graphite test specimens.
In-reactor tests 30 confirmed this good compatibility.

Radiation Effects on Graphite oo

20 years, it is only within the past 10 years that the effects of irra-
diation have been studied intensively. - These studies have been responsi-

The thin-wall tubular design used in the MSER is one of the better
configurations in reducing the differential growth problem to within the
capabilities of the graphite. The tubular shape also has the advantages
of good fabricability and reliable nondestructuve testing techniques to
ensure maximum integrity initially. Extrapolation of irradiation demage
data for doses to 2 X 1022 neutrons/cm? leads to the conclusion that
graphite should have an adequate life in the MSBR. However, we cannot
conclude this with certainty until we have exposed graphite to the doses
anticipated for the MSER. | |

Although there is no experimental evidence beyond.

2 Xx 1022 neutrons/cm?, several factors lead to optimism about the ability
of graphite to sustain much greater damage. The first factor. is the
recognition that in the 1292°F temperature range the contractural dimen-
sional changes for the first 1022 neutrons/cm? are due to the repair of
the damage caused by cooling the graphite from its graphitization temper-
ature. Doses above 1022 neutrons/cm? produce an expansion in the "c"
direction and a contraction in the "a" direction. In effect, the
stresses produced normal to the basal planes will be compressive rather
than tensile. This, of course, is very much preferred in that the
crystal can sustain this type of loading more readily without cracking.
Even so, measurements obtained from irradiated pyrolytic graphites
indicate that a deformation rate of about 1% shear strain per

1021 neutrons/cm?® must be absorbed. Thus, for a 5-year life, the graph-

ite tubes operating in a flux region of 6 X 10% neutrons cm™2 sec
absorb an internal deformation of about 100% shear strain. There is evi-
dence, however, that graphite can sustain this type of internal deformation
without creating microcracks. Very fine crystallite pyrocarbons have

been irradiated under conditions producing crystallite shearing rates

of 60% per 10°2 neutrons/cm® (ref. 51) and have demonstrated the ability
to absorb 160% shear strain without observable internal cracking or loss

of integrity. Thus, it is difficult to predict whether the anisotropic

as strain per dose. This is referred to as a strain rate although the

crystal growth will produce microcracks in the structure; and if the
microcracks are formed, whether they will be more detrimental to the
structure than the initial microcracks produced by cooling from the
graphitization temperature.

As previously mentioned, the relatively thin-wall tube design
minimizes stresses due to the differential growth, ‘The magnitude” of the’
maximum stress produced can be fairly well calculated with the main
uncertainty being the flux difference across the tube wall. Using a
conservative estimate of 2.4 x 10724 cm?/neutron as the growth rate
and a 10% flux drop across ‘the wall, a differential growth rate of
2.4 x 10725 em?/neutron is ‘obtained. The restraint is internal; there-
fore, about half of the differential growth is restrained to produce a
strain rate. Thus, a strain rate of 1.2 X 10~25 cm2/neutron is obtained
for comparison to an estimated creep rate coefficient of
4 x 10727 (psi)L The stress 1s simply and directly calculated to be:

Thus, the equilibrium stress level. is very low, probably much below that

required for failure even at high radiation dose levels.
Failure, however, could result from inability of the graphite to

absorb the creep deformation even though the stress level is much less

than the fracture stress. For lifetimes of 1X 1023, 2 X 10%?, and

4 x 1022 neutrons/en? (corresponding to 5-, 10-, and 20-year lifetimes),

- the strain to ‘be ‘absorbed would be 1.2, 2. 4, and 4.8%, respectively.

The consideration ‘of a strain limit for failure is. realistic; ‘however,
the strein limit for fracture has not been established. It ‘has been
demonstrated that graphite can: absorb strains in excess of 2% in

1022 neutrons/cm? under stresses. in excess of 3000 psi without fracture.

“There is also some evidence that growth rates of isotropic graphites

will diminish after a dose of 1022 neutron/em?. Thus, the graphite
will not be forced to gbsorb “the quantities of strain calculated.

 
 

[2

Although there is no direct evidence that graphite can sustain 1.2%
strain in 5 years of very high dose and low stress, the indirect evi-

dence does indicate that a failure is improbable.
Nondestructive Testing of Tubing

There has not been extensive development of nondestructive tests
for graphite at ORNL and other AEC installations32,33 or by industry.
However, past efforts at ORNL aimed at specific tests have produced IE
confidence that several NDT methods are applicable. These programs.
have produced background knowledge that will aid in subsequent |

development programs.

. Several low-voltage radiographic techniques nave been developed for .

use on low-density materials. These innovations have produced superior
achievements in sensitivity and have been applied to numerous graphite
shapes. Sufficient sensitivity has been obtained to make it possible to
permit examination of details as small as 1 W in carbon-coated fuel
particles. 33,36

The eddy-current method has been shown to be applicable to graphite
inspection. One of the earlier applications of this technique was for
inspecting the graphite support sleeves for the EGCR fuel assemblies. 57

More recent ORNL eddy-current work has included development of the
phase-sensitive instrument which overcomes some of the disadvantages of
conventional equipment. This device has been used to measure thicknesses
of graphite®® and to detect flaws in the unfueled graphite shells of
fuel spheres®® such as are proposed for advanced gas-cooled reactors.

Other testing with graphite has included studies of infrared
methods? to detect laminations or unbonded areas in the fueled spheres

MATERIALS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM FOR MOLTEN-SALT BREEDER REACTORS

In the previous sections of this report, we have shown that we have
a strong technical background in working with the'two primary structural
materials in the MSER, graphite and Hastelloy N. However, we feel that
certain advancements in technology must be made with respect to ‘both
materials to ensure the successful operation of the MSER. We will
briefly outline the areas of concern and indicate the work necessary for |
developing suitable technology in these areas. The cost estimate for the
materials development for the MSBR is appended.

Hastelloy N Program

Resistance to Irradiation Demage

 

~The major problen area with Hastelloy N requiring additional develop-
ment pefore 1t may be used in the MSBR is that of improving its resistance
“to neutron irradiation. The ‘present alloy is susceptible to a “type of
} high-temperature radiation damage that reduces the creep- rupture life and
the rupture ductility. Solving this problem will be a major consideration

in establishing the schedule for the MSBR. The problem is complicated

by the long lead time required to obtain in-reactor mechanical property
data and by the fact that the solution appears to lie in a change in
composition. This means that once a modified radiation-resistant alloy
is developed, it will be necessary to determine if the changes in composi-
tion have affected any other properties. Another complication is that it
has been shown that the radiation damage is sensitive to fabrication
practice, so to be truly representative, material used will have to be
taken from large commercial heats. Obviously, a compromise is required
in which small laboratory heats will be used initially for screening with
the results being confirmed with material from the large heats. The
fabrication practices for the large and small heats will be kept as nearly
alike as possible.

Our work has shown that titanium, zirconium, and hafnium are effec-
tive additions that will reduce the radiation damage of Hastelloy N. We
have not established the exact mechanism responsible for the improvement,
but feel that it is associated with the reactivity of these elements with
boron and other impurities in Hastelloy N. | |

During the first year, screening-type tests are being run. The
major goal is to determine which of the additives appears to be the most
effective and to begin obtaining an indication of the optimum composition.
Machined specimens are being irradiated in capsules at elevated tempera-
tures; on removal they are used to determine the tensile and creep-rupture
properties of the material. During this period, most testing will be on
laboratory-size vacuum-melts and on small (100 1b) commercial melts.

These irradiations are being conducted in the ORNL Research Reactor and
the Engineering Test Reactor.

A limited number of ita wil be evaluated by being insite
into the core of the MSRE. These samples will be added as the surveil-
lance specimens are removed for testing. These samples will be tested
to obtain postirradiation mechanical properties and studied metallograph-
ically to determine whether corrosion has occurred. Lo

The second year will be spent in determining the optimum composition,
heat treatment, and fabrication practice for the most promising additives.
Since these composition changes may adversely affect other properties,

alloys based on at least two different alloy additions will be carried
through this step. The majority of the testing will still be postirradia-
tion tensile and creep-rupture. The results will, however, be confirmed.

by running a few in-reactor stress-rupture tests. Both laboratory and

small melts commercially fabricated will be tested with a shift gradually

being made to the latter type.
Large commercial heats (1500 1b) of a few compositions will be tested
during the second and third years. This material will also be available

for -other testing programs, These ingots will show if scaling-up in size

has any adverse effects and also if materials from different vendors are
comparable. When the composition is firmly established, we shall procure
a few full-scale commercial heats (10,000 1b). |

Specifications must be issued during the first year of testing; they
will be continually upgraded by incorporating new data as they become
available, The specifications for materials for & full-size mockup and
for the MSBR will be issued during the third year. As both the mockup

"and reactor material are received they will be irradiation tested.

Corrosion Program

Molten Salt. — Since the reference design of the MSBR primary coolant
circult incorporates the same basic fuel salts and construction materials
as the MSRE, an extensive corrosion progrem will not be required. The
large volume of data generated during the development and operation of
the MSRE is directly. applicable to the MSBR and has demonstrated that an

acceptable system has been. developed.

Corrosion testing for the primary system will be mainly in the area
of proof testing. As compositional adjustments are made to the Hastelloy N
or to the graphite, their effects on corrosion will have. to be determined.

The active metals being proposed: as a solution to the radiation-

embrittlement problem may increase the corrosion rate, although our pre-~

vious experience indicates that the effect will be small. Alloys of
modified composition will be evaluated initially in thermal-convection
loops. As the final composition is established more firmly, ‘the corrosion
behavior will be better established by pump loops.

 
 

68 | | .

Sufficient information is available to indicate that corrosion prob- .
lems are not to be expected in the blanket salt system; however, because
of fewer tests, such a conclusion is not as well substantiated as that
for the primary system. It will be necessary to operate thermal-convection
and pump loops with the actual proposed salt composition as proof tests.
As with the primary system, any major changes in Hastelloy N or graphite
will be checked with these salts. :

‘Another area of corrosion testing is anticipated in association with
the development of a low-melting coolant salt for the MSBR. Studies of
both fluoroborate and stannous fluoride systems are currently under way
for this application. Neither salt system has been subjected to evalua-
tions in prior corrosion studies, and corrosion data will obviously be
required in the overall assessment of their properties relative to the
Additional corrosion studies are being planned in support of goals
of longer range than the MSBR. In particular, the improvements in purity .
and chemical stability of fluoride systems have brought us to a stage
where it appears reasonable to consider the use of austenitic stainless | Ce
steels as salt-containment materials. The transition from a nickel- to
iron-base alloy offers important economic advantages in larger sized,
molten-salt reactor plants, and there is a strong incentive for examining
the utility of iron-base systems in the coolant-salt region alone. :

Accordingly, we plan to investigate the behavior of stainless steels in
the presence of the LiF-BeF,; salt system both as a function of salt-
processing techniques and exposure temperatures. |

Steam. — Although Eastelloy N looks very attractive for use . in the
steam circuit, we shall run some proof tests to demonstrate the compat-
ibility of Hastelloy N and supercritical steam. Engineering experiments
are planned that involve steam and coolant salt separated by Hastelloy N. 60
These tests should yield useful heat transfer data as well as provide

metal corrosion data.

Witriding

To minimize any explosive hazard, a nitrogen blanket is proposed for

‘use around the reactor vessel, Preliminary studies have shown that nitrogen

is dissociated by the nuclear: environment and may react with the Hastelloy N.
The rate of reaction varies from heat to heat of the alloy.

Specimens of Hastelloy N will be exposed to NH3, in the: absence of
irradiation, and the effects on mechanical properties determined. : Samples
from various heats of material will be exposed to reveal the rate-
controlling element in the alloy. 1f any deleterious effects are found,
additional samples will be exposed in in-reactor experiments. + If nitriding
is indeed a problem, the cell atmosphere will be changed to another gas,

such as argon.

Joining Developnent

While a detailed examination of the joining problems for the MSBR
cannot be made: until designs have progressed beyond the conceptual phase,
a tentative evaluation has been conducted to reveal the major problem
areas, The fabrication problems fall into two categories: (1) the
original construction and (2) maintenance of the system. The latter
will be by far the more difficult of the two since, in most cases, it
must be maintained remotely. _

Welding ‘will be encountered in the reactor care, reactor vessel fab-

- rication, heat exchangers for “the fuel and blanket systems, and in the

assembly of the piping system. Fortunately, the large number of Joining
tasks may be combined into a ‘few general types, at least for the initial
development. This ‘combining of problems will greatly reduce the effort

required for the first 2 years. The general problems are: =

1. ‘joining graphite to itself, Rie

.~+ Joining graphite to Hastelloy N,

. general welding development of Hastelloy N,

Joining Hastelloy N tubes to ‘Hastelloy N headers,

. development of remote welding techniques for a variety of Hastelloy N

joints from 4 in. to 6 ft in ‘diameter,

6. remote capping or plugging of tubes.

 
 

70

The proposed programs for solving the graphite joining problems are
included in the graphite section .of this report. The programs for the
other problems will be presented in the following section.

~ Géneral Welding Development of Hastelloy N. — The welding of
Hastelloy N has been developed to the point that it was possible to con-
struct the MSRE using a wide variety of welded joints. However, before
a MSBER is constructed, additional welding development is desirable. - This
general welding development will be aimed primarily at a better under-
standing of the weld-crackilng problem which has been encountered with
Hastelloy N but is also common to all high-nickel:alloys.

Weld-cracking problems have sporadically occurred in commercial

heats of Hastelloy N manufactured to the same specification and by ‘the
same procedure. While we were able to work around this problem by using

a weld-cracking test to select the material, the cause was not established.
To avoid this problem, welding and metallurgical studies aimed at under-

standing the basic reasons -for cracking will be conducted. Previous
indications that cracking was associated with segregation of alloying
elements need to be expanded to a wider variety of compositions. These
studies will rely heavily on the use of the electron microprobe to
delineate the segregation. Welds will be made in material prepared for,
the radiation damage program and also in special small heats specifically
for welding studies. The various compositions will be welded at several
heat inputs with restraint applied to the pieces. ‘Heats showing tenden-
cles to crack will be studied on the "Gleeble"6! which will be programmed
to magnify any effects resulting from heating. ‘

As work progresses on the development of a radiation-resistant alloy,
it will be necessary to conduct weldability studies on the likely candi-
dates. Zirconium, one of the attractive alloying additions, is known to
be detrimental to welding. Attempts will therefore be made to find a set
of welding parameters that will be adaptable to the zirconium-containing

 

617rade name for a machine designed to simulate the type of heating
obtained in the heat-affected zone of a weld. The specimen can be
fractured after heating to determine the resultant ductility.

alloys. It will also be necessary to make welds that can be fabricated
into irradiation samples to demonstrate adequate radiation resistance of
the weldments. |

Currently, the filler metals used for welding Hastelloy N are of the
same composition as the base material. Results in the two previous
programs will be examined for indications of ways to improve the welds
by changing the composition of the filler metals. Possible improvements
will be sought by eliminating impurities known to be harmful or by the
‘addition of other elements to alter the form of the harmful impurity.
Preliminary tests have indicated that the addition of either niobium or
tungsten to the filler metal will improve weldsbility. - This lead will
be pursued and the composition optimized. oo a

Joining Development for Components, — As the engineering components
get larger and the reactor power increases, it will be necessary to use
heavier sections in construction, With such sections, there will be an
economic incentive to use welding processes capeble of high deposition
rates. All previous welding of Hastelloy N has ‘been with the tungsten.
arc process which is reliable but slow, Processes of potential interest
for the higher deposition rates are gas metal-arc, submerged-arc, and
plasma welding. These processes by their very natures utilize high heat
inputs and, therefore, studies of their heat-affected zones will be
required. Welding parameters will be established for any process which,
in the preliminary testing, looks promising. These processes vill also
be studied as to their suitability for use in remote welding.

~ Procedures for making tube- to-header joints for small tubes (0. 50 in.)

were developed and used successfully for the MSRE heat exchanger. These

Joints were welded and ‘then back-brazed. For the MSER, a large number

of such Joints, many with much larger ‘tubes, will be required. ‘The major
welding development effort in this area therefore will be to adapt the
present techniques to the new geometries and to automate them. While
manual welding is. possible, The large number of such welds. make ‘automation

appear imperative. Because of the larger size components required and

 
 

72

limitations in sizes of brazing or annealing furnaces, it may be necessary
to handle the bundles in subsections which are subsequently welded
together, -

To reduce the costs and to simplify the designs, the elimination of
back-brazing will be explored. Conventional mechanical-expanding tech-
niques, such as rolling or plug drawing, will be investigated and tested
‘for reliability. Use of high energy forming for expanding and bonding
would appear to be a promising technique. We have the equipment at ORNL
for these processes and will investigate them further.

‘Remote Joining. — A major program will be required to develop remote
welding and brazing techniques. It will be necessary to first develop
techniques for the specific geometry and then to adapt them to remote
operation. The development of the positioning end guiding fixtures will
be a ma jor part of the program, These phases of the program will be pert
‘of the maintenance ‘equipment development, 62 geveral different types of
| remote welds will be required and they will be sufficiently different to
require separate development.

Although the welds differ in size and geometry, the programs for
their development will attempt to answer similar questions. The general
questions ares | oo

1. Which welding technique will be most reliable?

2. What are the necessary welding parameters, such as voltage,
current, wire feed rate, and torch speed, and over what limits may they
vary? This will include sequences for start, operation, and stop.

3. What is the recommended Joint design, and how much misalignment
of the pieces can be permitted? oo

4, How pure an inert atmosphere will be required, both inside and

 

outside the pipe?
5. What are the effects of small amounts of fluoride contamination?

6. What is the permissible misalignment of the welding torch?

7. How will the pipes and the torch be positioned?

The major problem with the Hastelloy N-to-Hastelloy N butt joints
in tubes will be the limited space around each pipe; this is approximately
1 in. Present plans are to develop a single procedure for the initial
assembly and for remote repairs. Several weld joint designs appear
possible and will be investigated. A concurrent effort will be conducted
on remote brazing for joining these tubes. This technique, which was
developed for the MSRE, makes use of a conical-type Joint in which one
member must either twist or slide as the braze metal melts 53

A single development effort should suffice for all the large
(approx 12-in.-diam) remote pipe joints. Many of these joints are
containment members, so a high degree of reliability will be required.
This makes remote welding much more attractive than mechanical-joining
techniques. * While these pipes are of large diameter, they do not have
heavy walls. However, the addition of filler metal will be necessary.
After completion of exploratory studies, a selection of the applicable
welding process will be made. Welds similar to these were developed by
Westinghouse for the Pennsylvania Advanced Reactor, 5% and their procedures
will serve as a starting point. A complication with these welds will be
the tight limit on pipe lengths required to minimize fuel inventory. The
positioning and aligning present difficulties since short, large-
diameter pipes are very rigid. An insert may be required to guide the
pipes together. - Ce oo

- If one tube of a heat exchanger develops a leak, it will have to

~ be plugged or the whole unit will have to be replaced. It will be neces-

sary to plug the ends of the failed tube through a small access port in

each end of the exchanger. . Such plugging procedures are standard on

commercial heat exchangers, but are not for remote applications. - The
positioning equipment for such a Job would be similar to that used to -
cut small pieces from the HRT core tank. 5?

For such an application, a plug must be developed which can be
inserted into the tube and then fused to the header. A ma jor problem
will be that such a weld is by nature highly restrained and is, therefore,
subject to cracking. This may require trepanning the head before the
plug is inserted and welded.

Inspection Development

While a complete evaluation of testing and inspection problems cannot

be made until a firm design is available, some are apparent from the con-

ceptual design. The ones requiring most attention are those that will have

to be made remotely. Inspection development for the Hastelloy N tubing
and pipe will consist of adapting available techniques to the necessary
configurations and to the required sensitivity levels. The techniques
developed for inspecting the MSRE heat exchanger should also be adaptable
" to the MSER heat exchangers. ‘Techniques to be used would include
penetrants, radiography, and ultrasonics.

Remote inspection will be required for (1) Hastelloy N tube joints
at the fuel header, (2) large butt-weld pipe joints to disconnect “the
main piping from both the reactor and the heat exchangers, and (3) plugs

in the heat exchanger tubes. Until development of the joining techniques

has progressed further, it is impractical to speculate on inspection
procedures. Several testing techniques will be evaluated.

‘In developing the nondestructive testing techniques, three phases
must be completed (not necessarily in sequence). They are (1) demonstra-
tion of feasibility, (2) determination of test sensitivity and establish-

ment of reference standards, and (3) development of detailed techniques
and equipment.

For the remotely inspected joints, each of the steps must first be
performed in a cold laboratory (but with cognizance of the need to
progress to remote operation) and then the necessary mechanical devices
must be developed for the remote performance. It may be possible to
devise accessories which can be. attached to the manipulators used to

fabricate the Joints.

Materials Development for Chemical Processing Equipment

 

The fuel salt will have to be continually reprocessed to remove
fission products. The present concept of this processing calls for dis-
tilling the salt at a temperature of about 1800°F. The strength require-
ments are quite modest, but the material will be exposed to salt on one
side and to some gaseous atmosphere on the other side. The easiest gas-
eous atmosphere to obtain is the cell environment which is Np + ~2% O,.
This would require that the material be fairly resistant to oxidation and
nitriding. The oxidation resistance is improved by increasing the chro-
mium content of the alloy, but this in turn increases the corrosion rate
on the salt side. We feel that several possibilities exist for materials
for constructing this vessel. :

1. Hastelloy N with an inert cover gas,

2. a molybdenum-base alloy with an inert cover gas,

3. a duplex system with a nickel-molybdenum alloy, exposed to the salt
and an oxidation-resistant material such as Haynes alloy No. 25
exposed to the cell enviroment,

4, a vessel made of an oxidation-resistant alloy with a graphite liner.

~~ These possibilities and others will have to be explored by screening

“tests to determine resistance to oxidation, nitriding, and salt corrosion.

The ease of fabricability and cost of the candidate materials will also
be considered in making a final choice.

Graphite Program

The graphite that we need for this reactor requires that some advances
be made in present technology. Therefore, our first concern is to procure

material that meets our specifications for study. The major items to be

 
 

 

76

evaluated for this material are (1) determining its behavior at radiation
dose levels as high as possible, (2) joining of graphite to itself and to
structural materials, (3) fabrication development to yield a low gas
permeability, (4) evaluation and characterization of the modified or
improved graphite, (5) determining its compatibility when used with
Hastelloy N in a system circulating fused salts at elevated temperatures,
and (6) fabrication of the graphite into engineering systems and evaluating
its performance. Because of its greater potential for reducing radiation
damage effects, the major effort will be on the development of isotropic
graphite. However, this material is so new and so little is known about
it, development of anisotropic graphite such as the needle-coke types
will also be continued. The proposed development program is discussed

in the following sections. :

Graphite Fabrication and Evaluation

The grade CGB graphite used in the MSRE was produced in experimental
equipment and its properties still leave much to be desired for a MSBR. -
No graphite from any source is now available that will meet all of the
MSBR requirements. Since there is no present industrial need for low-
permeability graphite, we are not likely to obtain much allied develop-
ment help from industry. An adequate supply of the highest quality.
graphite will be purchased to supply material for use in test rigs, to
establish reasonable specifications, and for evaluation. Continuing
orders will be placed as improvements, or potential improvements, are
made in the quality. The intent is to progress in order size from the
laboratory to the pilot plant and then to a production-size order. Until
material is actually produced in production equipment and is tested,
doubt will exist as to how representative the smaller batches really are.
It is expected that grade CGB or a similar graphite will be ‘used in the
first tests.

The various problems to be faced will include:

1. As soon as possible, consult with manufacturers and prepare a
specification for small lots (laboratory quantities) of graphite of as
near MSBR quality as it is possible to obtain immediately.

 
 

 

 

77

2. Place small orders for both isotropic and anisotropic grades of
graphite in the form of block and pipe.

3. Measure pertinent physical and inechanical properties of
representative graphites. oo Cn

4. In about 1 year, prepare a specification for a pilot-size batch
of the most promising type, or types, of graphite, It is not expected
that any significant new radiation~damage information will be available

at this time, . } SL .
5. . If suitable graphite cannot be purchased from outside sources,

an in-house pilot-production facility will have to be established.

Irradiation Behavior

In laying out any graphite development program, an enigma rapidly

becomes apparent, One. of the major unknowns is the effect of massive

neutron doses. To obtain the desired doses requires irradiation periods

of two to three years, ‘and we would like to Firmly establish in three
years that graphite will have an acceptable life in the MSER. ~ The problem
therefore is that, if during the development period major changes are made
in the graphite, the graphite being irradiated will no longer be repre
sentative and the results will therefore be suspect. The most satisfactory
solution appears to be starting irradiation tests as soon as possible with
samples fabricated from the highest quality material available and to fol-
low these with other tests of improved material, The purpose of the work
would be to determine first the dimensional stability of the graphite for
the temperatures and high-radiation doses that would have to be sustained

in the MSBR plus the effects of irradiation on the graphite properties,
such as creep ductility, ‘mechanical properties, accessible voids, and
permeability. The inclusion of both anisotropic and isotropic graphite
is warranted since the anisotropic has more technological development
‘behind it, but the isotropic graphite which has been under development for

approximately three years shows more potential. These experiments should

“be performed on graphite, grephite-to.grephlte Joints, and graphite-to-

Hastelloy N Joints.

 
 

78

To demonstrate the ability of graphite to successfully retain its
integrity after exposure to dose levels of 1 x 1023 neutrons/cm? (5-year
life), we plan to irradiate graphite to as near this dose as possible.
This will require the irradiations to be performed in reactors that have
fast fluxes of 1015 neutrons cm=2 sec-1 or greater to obtain the data in
a reasonable time. At present, there are only two fast reactors, EBR-11
and Dounreay, and one thermal reactor, HFIR, that approach the fast-flux

requirements. Approximate values of the time required to reach a dose

of 1X 1023 neutrons/cm?, cost per year, and facility size are listed in

 

 

Table 11.

It is, therefore, proposed to use HFIR to demonstrate the ability
of the graphite to retain its integrity after an exposure of -
1 x 10? neutrons/cm?, Due to the size limitation of HFIR, the irradi-
ation will be restricted to simply prepost type of testing. To
demonstrate the ability of the MSBR graphite to absorb creep strain,
restrained growth type experiments will be performed in EBR-II. By
enforcing a creep rate equal to the growth rate, the creep strain
accumulation.will be forced into the material ten times faster than
under MSBR conditions. Although an equivalent neutron exposure will
not be achieved, the enforced strain will be greater than expected in
the MSER.

3 Graphite Joining
Since the graphite-to-Hastelloy N joint is a very important part of
the system, we will carry parallel efforts on at least two different types
of joint. Braze joints of several designs will be evaluated using the
35% Ni=-60% Pd—5% Cr alloy and pure copper as brazing materials. These
joints will be designed so that graphite is initially in compression
where it is strongest and has the ability to undergo small amounts of
plastic strain. This will minimize the tensile stress that will develop
in the graphite as it shrinks due to irradiation. A mechanical type of
Joint will also be evaluated as a second preference. These joints will
be made using the 5-in.-0D X 1/2-in.-wall graphite pipes that are presently
in the MSBR design. These joints will be subjected to thermal cycling,
evaluated for corrosion resistance to the fuel and blanket salts, and
irradiated to determine integrity under service conditions. - :
The graphite-to-graphite joint will be studied in detail. Based on
~ this study the choice will be made between a graphitized joint and a
brazed joint.

Permeability Studies

 

As "improved" grades of graphite are received from producers, it
will be necessary to determine their permeability for molten fluorides,

 

helium, and fission gases. As was pointed out in the previous discussion,
obtaining graphite with the very low permeability of 1 x 10-7 cm? /sec
will be very difficult. When the data on xenon’ stripping: and the designs
of the MSER ‘become firmer, realistic values for gas Permeability will
have to be established. This program will include:

lL 1. studies of permeability to gases and molten salt of the various

 

} grades of graphite,
Lo 2. investigation of the properties of graphite which affect’ the Perme-
Bb ability and how it may be minimized,
3. measurement of the effects of various coatings on the permeability
of graphite, : ’
Co 4, determination of the permeability of graphite joints,
oo! 5. determination of the effects of fluorides and solid fission products

 

é on the graphite.

Corrosion and Compatibility of Graphite v
" Some additional data will be obtained on the compatibility of graphite
with Hastelloy N in systems circulating high-temperature fused salts. The
testing must also include the brazed joints. Initial tests will be simple
capsule tests containing both materials. Then small-scale graphite and .
graphite-Hastelloy N thermal-convection loops will be fabricated and SN
operated with fused salts to determine the compatibility and corrosion
resistance of these materials. The final stage will be testing in the
engineering loops to evaluate full-scale components. These large loops
ere a part of the component development program. The function of this
: task will be to thoroughly examine the components after exposure in the
loops. LL oo
Date on effects of irradiation on corrosion and compatibility will
be obtained from in-reactor tests in the Chemical Research and Development
Program. %® Various types of graphite are being included in the Surveil-
lance Program with subsequent evaluation of fission-product retention 2
and changes in mechanical and physical properties.

Graphite Inspection

The necessary nondestructive testing program for the graphite tubes
proposed to be used for MSBR would cover several test methods. It is
‘anticipated that eddy-current techniques would be used for dimensional
gaging and both low-voltage radiography and eddy-current techniques would
be used to detect discontinuities, If laminations are present and unde-
sirable, it may be necessary to use ultrasonics or infrared techniques
to detect them. For geometries more complex then concentric tubes, the
seme methods would likely be pursued. However, there would be more
requirement for dimensional gaging and the flaw-finding techniques would
be more difficult to develop. The development would proceed in the

following steps (not necessarily in sequence):

1, determination of feasibility of application of the test method to
the configuration and grade of graphite,

2. determination of characteristic flaws and relative test sensitivity

attainable,

3. establishment of reference standards,

4, development of detailed techniques (perhaps including equipment).

General Development and Project Assistance

Many details of the final design will depend upon the properties of
the two primary structural materials — graphite and modified Hastelloy N.
As we progress with the development of these materials, we will keep the
designers informed, so that this information can be incorporated in the
design. Several of the planned engineering tests will also require
assistance. We shall be called upon for design assistance and fabrica-
tion technology. The evaluation of many of the test results will be made
by materials personnel, After working with the vendors to obtain the
desired products and with the designers to finalize the MSBR design, we
will take an active part in writing the specifications, procuring the
materials, and assisting in the actual construction,

Several parts of the proposed molten-salt systems could probably
be made of cheaper materials, such as the austenitic stainless steels.
We do not have adequate corrosion data on these materials, but tests
will be initiated to obtain this information on a second priority basis.

We will critically assess the properties of these materials for this

program and introduce them where they appear ‘advantageous.
