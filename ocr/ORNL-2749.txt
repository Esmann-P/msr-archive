ABSTRACT

Solubility measurements of rare-earth and yttrium fluorides have been made in various solvents

containing zirconium or beryllium fluoride with certain alkali-metal fluorides, and in some cases

uranium fluoride, present.

Tests have been performed which pertain to the development af a

method of removal of rare earth fluoride nuclear poisons from certain mixtures of interest to the

Molten Salt Power Reactor Program. The method is shown to be effective in several concentration

ranges.

 

INTRODUCTION

Rare-earth fission products formed in a reactor
fueled with a circulating molten fluoride solution
may be expected to account for significant neutron
loss. Appreciation of this fact has motivated
studies of solubilities which would be pertinent
to the design and operation of such a reactor.
The feasibility of several processes in which
rare earths could be extracted from molten fluoride
solutions depends substantially on the solubility
relations among the rare-earth fluorides. This same
information also is of interest with regard to the
maintenance of homogeneity of the fuel, since
precipitation of a rare-earth fluoride in the fuel
circuit of the reactor might interfere with its satis-
factory operation.

This report presents some of the data obtained
on the solubilities of LaF,, CeF,, SmF,, and
YF, in solvents containing sodium fluoride and
zirconium fluoride and in others containing beryl-
lium fluoride with lithium or sodium fluoride.

Two. specific uranium-containing compositions
which -are potentially useful in a molten-fluoride-
fueled reactor have been selected. In addition,
a sufficient variety of non-uranium-containing
solvents have been chosen to assure that the
solubility relations among this selection of rare-
earth fluorides would be adequately known. This
is a continuation of work reported earlier! con-
cerning a solvent of composition NaF-ZrF -UF

(50-46-4 mole %). The same radiotracer technique
was used for the present work.

RESULTS
Solubility of Single Rare-Earth Fluorides

The solubilities of CeF,, LaF, and SmF, meas-
ured in the solvent, LiF-BeF,-UF , (62.8-36.4-0.8
mole %), are shown in Fig. 1 along with the cor-
responding results from the earlier work. Although
the solubility levels of these solutes in the LiF-
BeF ,-UF, solvent mixture are considerably lower
than in the NaF-ZrF -UF, composition, they are
still adequate to assure that precipitation of the
rare-earth fluorides would not be inimical to re-
actor operation at probable burnup rates for about
four or five years.? A second feature of the data
is the closer approximation of the data for the
beryllium-containing solvents to a straight line
on the plot of log solubility vs T~!, which may
be interpreted as implying a lower degree of in-
teraction in the solution between solute and
solvent ‘cations. This approach to ideality of the
solute in the beryllium system would not be ex-
pected to affect the feasibility of a solid solvent
extraction process, since both the substituting ion
[presumably Ce(lll)] and the extracted ions [e.g.,
Sm(I11)] would behave similarly.

For comparison, the solubility of YF, along
with that of CeF,, is shown in Fig. 2 for a single
NaF-BeF , composition (61-39 mole %). From these
results it may be inferred that the same qualitative

order of solubilities exists for the rare-earth fluo-
rides in these solvents as was observed in the
NaF-ZrF ,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %) and LiF-BeF,-
UF, (62.8-36.4-0.8 mole %) solvents. This de-
crease in solubility with increase in the size of
the trivalent solute cation is probably related to
an as yet unmedsured trend of the heats of fusion
of the trifluorides.

Solubility of Rare-Earth Fluorides as
Functions of Composition

Figure 3 shows that the presence of UF, in
small amounts does not affect the rare-earth solu-
bility greatly. The proportion of alkali-metal fluo-
ride to BeF, or ZrF ,, however, has a considerable
effect.

Several experiments were performed to determine
the solubility of a typical rare-earth fluoride,
CeF,, in various solvents in each of the systems

in the four systems for several temperatures. Data
from which these curves were obtained are listed
in the Appendix. Figure 7 displays the 600°C
isotherm for the solubility of CeF, in the three
solvent systems containing beryllium. These curves
indicate the magnitude of the solvent interaction,
which is apparently less in the LiF-BeF, system
than in those containing NaF. The solubilities
exhibit minima in each case at compositions near
37 mole % BeF,. These minima appear to occur
at slightly higher BeF, concentrations at higher
temperatures (Figs. 5 and 6).

Solubilities of Mixed Rare-Earth Fluorides in
LiF-BeF ,-UF, (62.8-36.4-0.8 Mole %)

Rare-ecrth fluorides form solid solutions with
each other. However, they apparently do not form
solid solutions with the fuel solvent components.
These facts, coupled with the strong temperature
dependence of their solubilities, suggest that a
solid-solvent extraction might be a'feasible method

Solvent composition calculated

for substituting a low-cross-section rare earth
(e.g., Ce) for the high-cross-section ones (e.g.,
Sm). For a thermal reactor the differences in
poisoning between Ce and, say, Sm are large.
The advantages from the standpoint of neutron
economy of such a scheme are, consequently,
great. The advantage of this type of extraction for
an intermediate- or fast-neutron reactor is con-
siderably less. In the consideration of any of
the extraction schemes which are based on the
substitution of an innocuous rare-earth fluoride for
a high-cross-section one, the required data include
the solubility behavior of mixed rare-earth fluo-
rides. Such information will allow the single-stage
equilibrium distribution to be calculated.

The solubilities of selected pairs of rare-earth
fluorides in LiF-BeF ,-UF (62.8-36.4-0.8 mole %)
have been determined, with substantially the same
techniques as those reported earlier.’ In the
earlier work it was shown that the pairs LaF ,-

The equation representing a single equilibrium
stage for the extraction of a. poison (e.g., SmF,)
from the solvent by a solid (e.g., CeF,) is

CeF 4(ss) + SmF 4(d) = CeF,(d) + SmF (ss)

is dissolved in the solvent, and (ss) that it is
in solid solution. With suitable restrictive con-
ditions the equilibrium constant for this reaction

“sistent with those observed for the NaF-ZrF ,-UF

(50-46-4 mole %) solvent.! Table 1 shows the
calculated extraction coefficients along with those
based on the experimental results for the CeF ,-
LaF, system. Although the estimated values are
somewhat poorer than in the earlier work, the
present data appear to be entirely adequate for
practical purposes.

A possibility existed that AIF; might offer some
advantage as the solid extractant in view of its
lower cost and neutron cross section. Solubility
measurements of AIF, in the same LiF-BeF,-UF
solvent indicated that the solubility increases with
the amount of AIF, added. The data presented in
Fig. 10 show also that the addition of CeF, de-
creases the AIF, solubility somewhat. The pre-
cipitating phase is probably 3LiF-AlF, (ref 3).
Figure 11 shows that the solubility of CeF, is
somewhat higher in the presence of AIF; than in

similar to that seen above upon addition of BeF,,.
As a consequence of this behavior, it is clear that
AIF, cannot be used as a solid extractant for rare
earths.

Additional Data Pertinent to a Solid-Solvent
Extraction of Rare-Earth Poisons

In addition to determining the single-stage equi-
librium extraction coefficients, it is necessary
to know something of the rate of reaction of dis-
solved rare earth with solid extractant and to know
whether trace amounts of rare earth would be ex-
tracted as predicted. A simple isothermal experi-
ment was performed at 500°C which used unlabeled
LaF, as solid extractant for 0.15 wt % CeF
(tracer labeled) dissolved in LiF-BeF, (63-37
mole %). An amount of LaF, equal to about four
times the amount necessary to saturate the solu-
tion was added. One minute after the addition, the
CeF, content in the liquid phase had dropped to
0.04 wt % and 5 min later (when the second filtrate

To determine whether trace amounts of rare-earth
fluorides would behave as predicted, a polythermal
experiment was carried out in which solid CeF
(unlabeled) was added in two increments to LiF-
BeF ,-UF (62.8-36.4-0.8 mole %) in which was
dissolved 0.0795 wt % SmF ; (tracer labeled). The
results of this experiment are shown in Table 2.
The really excellent agreement with the calculated
amounts of SmF, indicates that trace.amounts of
rare-earth poisons act in an essentially predictable
manner. Co

An initial attempt at performing.a solid-solvent
extraction was made in which LaF; was packed
