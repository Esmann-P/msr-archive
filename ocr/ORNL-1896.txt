FOREWORD

This quarterly progress report of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Project at ORNL records the
technical progress of the research on circulating-fuel reactors and all other ANP research at the
Laboratory under its Contract W-7405-eng-26. The report is divided into three major parts:
I. Reactor Theory, Component Development, and Construction, ll. Materials Research, and
Ill, Shielding Research.

The ANP Project is comprised of about 475 technical and scientific personnel engaged in
many phases of research directed toward the achievement of nuclear propulsion of aircraft. A
considerable portion of this research is performed in support of the work of other organizations
participating in the national ANP effort. However, the bulk of the ANP research at ORNL is
directed toward the development of a circulating-fuel type of reactor.

The design, construction, and operation of the Aircraft Reactor Test (ART), with the coopera-
tion of the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Division, are the specific objectives of the project. The
ART is to be a power plant system that will include a 60-Mw circulating-fuel reflector-moderated
reactor and adequate means for heat disposal. Operation of the system will be for the purpose
of determining the feasibility, and the problems associated with the design, construction, and

operation, of a high-power, circulating-fuel, reflector-moderated aircraft reactor system.

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

SUMMARY

PART I. REACTOR THEORY, COMPONENT
DEVELOPMENT, AND CONSTRUCTION

1. Reflector-Moderated Reactor

The development of the reactor layout is con-
tinuing. New features that have been incorporated
because of stress, fluid flow, or fabricability
considerations include an elliptical fuel expansion
tank, a rounded dome to enclose the top of the
reactor, a newly designed sodium pump impeller,
and other related items. Recently completed heat
exchanger tests yielded consistent data from which
a series of heat exchangers is being designed.
The most promising of these will be chosen for
the ART.

The preliminary layout of the interior of the ART
test cell which shows the major items of equip-
ment and the recommended provisions for support
was completed. A similar layout for the NoK
piping and radiators was also completed so that
drawings for the building and concrete work could
proceed. More detailed drawings of the cell that
will show the disposition of the small items and
the instrumentation are being prepared.

Information block diagrams showing the basic-
control actions desired for the ART have been
prepared and will be used as a basis for selection
of the hardware types and the control techniques
to be used and for determination of areas of con-
trol that will require new component development.

The room-temperature critical experiments for

‘the ART have shown that the critical mass de-
creases’ very rapidly as the neutron “absorption in
.the core shell decreases. Hence, replacement of
- the highly absorbing Inconel by a low-cross- -section.

material, such | as _columbium, would bring about a

- substantial saving in uranium investment’ and,
“incidenta
“negative. For fabrication | reasons, only about 50%

Hy, make the temperature coefficient more

 

of the Inconel could be replaced by columbium. It is
estimated that the effect of a 50% replacement

would’ be to reduce the critical mass by about
16. 5%, or

i saving in’ uranium’ ‘con

sponds to a 0.7 mole %

 
  

7-kg saving in total U235 investment.

Calculations were made of the temperature coef-
ficients of the ART that check well with previous

ation of the fuel and a

multigroup calculations. The results support the
postulated negative over-all temperature coef-
ficient. It has also been found that, if as much as
5 wt % lithium were added to the NaK in the
secondary coolant circuit, the reactivity of the
ART would be a fairly sensitive indication of a
NaK leak into the fuel circuit. Burnup and gamma-
ray heating of rare-earth oxides being considered
as control rod materials are being studied.

2. Experimental Reactor Engineering

A series of design changes have been made in
the nose, or heater, section of the in-pile loop as
more information concerning the neutron flux in
the MTR beam hole and the flux depression of the
materials of loop construction has become avail-
able. The present nose section consists of a
2Y “turn coil (an increase of 1 turn) with its axis
parallel to the beam hole center line. The flux
seen by the fuel in the in-pile loop is now expected
to be 30% of the unperturbed value, and the average
power density in the nose section will be 0.7
kw/cm?.

A working mockup of the in-pile loop has been
completed and is being operated with the fuel
mixture NaF-ZrF,-UF, (53.5-40-6.5 mole %) at a
Reynolds number of about 5000, a temperature
differential of 175°F, and a maximum fuel temper-
ature of 1500°F. Resistance heating is employed.
The experience gained will aid in operation of the

in-pile loop at the MTR.
The fission gas holdup system for the loop is

“being tested with flow rates of 0.15 and 0.03 scth

of helium with about 0.13% krypton. After 15 days

number of test stands to ten. Operation of 16
loops was terminated during the quarter. The
majority of these loops operated for 1000 hr in
the Reynolds number range of 1,000 to 15,000 and
with temperature differentials of 100 to 300°F.
The excessive high wall temperature in the bends
of electric-resistance-heated loops was corrected
by relocation of the heating elements so that heat
is applied in only straight sections of tubing.

Four test stands are now in operation for studying

¢orrosion and mass transfer of sodium-Inconel and
sodium=Inconel—stainless steel systems. Oper-
ation of six such loops was terminated this quarter
at the conclusion of periods of either 500 or 1000
hr with maximum sodium temperatures of up to
1500°F. Appreciable deposits of mass-transferred
material were found in the cold legs of these
loops, and therefore a controlled series of experi-
ments was started. The loops will provide infor-
mation on the effects of the oxygen content of the
sodium, the use of a cold trap, the use of a lower
temperature, and the use of an all-stainless-steel
system.
- The ART fuel pump (model MF-2) was operated
in water performance tests. Some cavitation noises
were present in all tests, but no serious effect of
the apparent cavitation on performance could be
found. It is estimated that the efficiency of the
pump at design point, exclusive of seal and bearing
losses, is 70%. New inlet volute configurations
are currently being designed and tested. The
bearing and seal, cold mechanical shakedown, and
high-temperature test stands are being fabricated
and assembled.

An extensive program of heat exchanger testing
is under way for obtaining reliable heat transfer
data on fuel-to-NaK heat exchangers of the general
type and configuration for ART application. Con-
siderable information will be obtained on the effect
of corrosion and mass transfer on materials of
fabrication in high-temperature, high-heat-flux,
NaK and fluoride systems. An opportunity will
also be provided for ascertaining the structural
integrity and reliability of fabrication of heat
exchangers and radiators supplied by outside
vendors. Co
The program involves the operation of three
intermediate heat exchanger (HE) test stands and
two small heat exchanger (SHE) test stands, such
as the SHE stand now in operation. The IHE
stands will be used to test large tube bundles

(about 100 tubes) of the general size and configu-
ration of ART heat exchangers (arranged for
regenerative operation), while the SHE stands will
be used to test smaller, more easily fabricated,

tube bundles (20 to 50 tubes). The SHE stand now

in operation will be modified for use as a general

test loop following termination of the current test.

Design of all IHE test stands is complete, and

procurement and assembly are well under way.
Design of the SHE test stands and procurement of
equipment are under way.

Water tests with a full-scale aluminum model of
the 21-in. ART core and the entrance header region
were initiated. Without inlet guide vanes, the
fluid was observed to enter the core at an angle of
about 70 deg from the vertical. Flow reversal at
the island was observed. Data from these tests
are being used in the design of turning vanes and
vortex generators to correct this unacceptable flow
condition.

A second thermal-cycling test of a sodium-
Inconel-beryllium system was completed. Over
100 thermal cycles were applied to the beryllium
piece between the range of the high power level,
61 w/cm® to the beryllium, and the low power
level, 2.5 w/cm®. The sodium temperature from
inlet to outlet at the high power level ranged from
1050 to 1200°F. Inspection of the beryllium piece
after the test (total operating time, 1030 hr) re-
vealed three axial cracks on the outer surface of
the hot end of the beryllium.

The 100-kw gas-fired heater was tested and was
found to perform very satisfactorily. Minor modi-
fications can be made to this heater that will
increase the capacity.

3. Critical Experiments

The critical assembly of the reflector-moderated
reactor consisting of the beryllium island and
reflector enclosing the fuel region and having axial
extrusions simulating the exit and entrance flow
channels was loaded with sufficient uranium to
give several per cent excess reactivity. This
overloading was used to evaluate some of the
materials of interest in the design of the ART prior
to dilution of the fuel to the critical uranium
density.

Measurements were made with samples of a
mixture of the oxides of the rare-earth elements
being considered for the absorber material of the

control rod of the ART. A cylinder of the mixture

0.79 in. in diameter and 21 in. long decreased the
reactivity nearly 2%; measurements with shorter
lengths of the material indicated that the totdl
value of the rod could be increased by 60% if the
diameter were increased to 1%, in. Tests made on
tubes of several different dimensions gave data
for the design of the control rod guide thimble.

In other experiments, columbium was shown to
be somewhat less poisonous than Inconel in a
neutron spectrum similar to that expected in the
ART, and it was found that a layer of beryllium in
the center of the fuel channel of the critical
assembly reduced the critical uranium concen-
tration by a few per cent. Fission rate distri-
butions were measured across the flow channel at
several locations in the central reactor region and
in the end duct.

A high-temperature critical experiment embodying
the nuclear characteristic of the ART has been
designed which will operate at zero nuclear power
at about 1200°F. The purposes of the experiment
are to measure the critical uranium concentration,
the temperature coefficient of reactivity, and the
effectiveness of control rods.

4. Chemistry of Reactor Materials

Interest in obtaining fuel mixtures more suitable
for use in a circulating-fuel reactor than those
available in the NaF-ZrF,-UF, system has led to
evaluation of the NaF-LiF-ZrF, ternary and the
NaF-LiF-ZrF -UF, quaternary systems. The NaF-
LiF-ZrF, system has been reasonably well de-
fined, but much work remains to be done on the
quaternary system. Phase- equilibrium data show
that quite low melting points are available in the

ternary system ‘and that ‘adequately Tow melting o

solubility of UF, at 600°C is sufficiently high to
provide more than a fraction of the concentration
needed for an ART fuel.

Previous measurements of the partial pressure of
HF at equilibrium during the reduction of FeF,
by hydrogen in NaZrF showed higher values than
would be predicted from thermochemical data and
ideal solution behavior, and it was postulated that
the higher values were due to a lowered activity
of the metallic iron because of alloying with the
nickel apparatus. The postulated alloying has
been confirmed by low values for final FeF, con-
tent of the melt and by chemical analyses of
portions of the nickel apparatus.

Additional data were obtained on the reduction
of UF, by structural metals. Data on the reduction
of UF, by metallic chromium with NaF-ZrF -UF
(51-45-4 mole %) showed that, in comparison with
the data obtained with NaF-ZrF,-UF, (48-48-4
mole %) as the solvent, an increase in the final
mole fraction of NaF from 0.48 to 0.51 in the melt
containing uranium causes a significant decrease
in the equilibrium CrF_ concentration. Data for
the reaction of UF, with metallic iron in these
mixtures and in NaF-KF-LiF (11.5-42-46.5 mole %)
agreed very closely and were somewhat higher at
600°C than at 800°C. Some, as yet inconclusive,
data were obtained on the reaction of UF, plus
UF. with chromium metal and Inconel in NaF-KF-
LiF (11.5-42-46.5 mole %) at 600 and 800°C. Ad-
ditional data were obtained that confirmed previ-
ous findings that FeF, is relatively stable in the
NaF-KF-LiF eutectic at 600 and 800°C and that
CrF, is not stable.

Previous evidence that UF, was more stable at
elevated temperatures than free energy estimates

‘had indicated was substantiated by vapor pressure
“rheasuréments on UF, in the temperature range

1270 to 1390°C. The disproportionation pressure

“curve that was obtained shows that the dispro-
“portionation of UF, is far from complete under the
“Conditions prevailing in the vapor pressure cell
and that UF, is thermodynamically stable with

 
 

ect fo pure UF, and uranium metal at temper-
atures below 1 1400°C.

In the investigation of variables ‘affecting the

“reduction of UF, with uranium in alkali fluorides,

the effects of the surface area of nickel or copper

“exposed to the melt and of adding excess uranium

metal were studied. [t has become apparent that
alloying of nickel and uranium can occur at temper-

 
 

 

 

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

atures far below the minimum nickel-uranium
liquidus temperature (732°C) and, consequently,
that disproportionation of UF, can be expected
to occur at the temperatures of interest at nickel
surfaces or at any metallic surface with which
uranium can alloy. Preliminary evidence was
obtained which indicated that UF, dissolved in
an alkali fluoride mixture is more stable in copper
than in nickel.

Investigations of methods for rapid purification
of fuel mixtures included attempts to use electroly-
sis under a hydrogen atmosphere to remove oxides
in order to avoid the container corrosion that
results when HF is used and to use metallic zir-
conium to replace most of the hydrogen in the
stripping operation. The use of zirconium metal
was demonstrated on a 5- and a 50-1b test scale
and was found to be a quite rapid and effective
method for purification if small quantities of UF
in the product are tolerable or desirable. In
electrolysis experiments, the ZrF ,-bearing mixtures
could be electrolyzed smoothly, but the alkali
fluoride mixtures gave variable results. Attempts
to prepare mixtures containing UF, and no UF,
were unsuccessful, the largest UF
tained being 85% in an NaF-ZrF, base.

Fifty-six pilot-scale preparations totaling 630 Ib
of material were produced in various compositions

content at-

for small-scale corrosion studies, for physical
property determinations, or, in many cases, for
use as purified intermediates in phase-equilibrium
studies. Uranium trifluoride was a component of
nearly 25% of the materials requested. Production
operations were resumed on March 1, 1955, on a
three-shift, five-day-week basis to provide test
material for the greatly accelerated ANP engi-
A total of 4800 1b of purified
material was prepared during the quarter. Attempts
to find a commercial source of ZrF, are under
way. If a commercial source is not found, it will
be necessary to expand the Y-12 production facili-
ties immediately. Two batches of enriched fuel
were prepared for use in an in-pile loop, and prepa-
rations are being made for the production of the
materials for the proposed high-temperature critical
experiment.

Potential measurements were made with combi-
nations of several half cells consisting of metal
electrodes bathed in solutions of the corresponding
metal ion in the molten salts. The temperature
range studied was, in general, 550 to 700°C.

neering program.

Cells consisting of zirconium rods immersed in
various NaF-ZrF, melts and cells consisting of
metallic nickel electrodes immersed in solutions
of NiF, in molten NaF-ZrF, melts were studied.

Vapor pressure measurements of mixtures in the
LiF-ZrF, system were started. The data showed
the vapor pressures of the LiF-ZrF, mixtures to
be considerably higher than those of the corre-
sponding NaF-ZrF ; mixtures.

An x-ray diffractometer for studying the structure
of liquids has been constructed and is undergoing
final testing. A high-temperature attachment for
an x-ray spectrometer has been used for studies
of compositions in the systems NaF-ZrF,, LiF-
ZrF,, and NaF-BeF,.

5. Corrosion Research

Several Inconel forced-circulation loops that
were operated with fluoride mixtures and with
sodium as the circulated fluids were examined.
The fluoride mixtures included ZrF base mixtures
with UF, and with combinations of UF, and UF,
and an alkali-metal base mixture containing UF,.
Favorable results were obtained with the ZrF ,-
base materials in that the depths of attack were
no deeper than have been found previously in
thermal-convection loops. Attacks as low as 5
mils in 1000 hr appear to be obtainable. The
conversion of some of the UF, to UF, decreases
the attack. The most important variables appear
to be maximum wall temperature and the hot-zone
surface-to-loop volume ratio, whereas large vari-
ations in velocity and Reynolds number have very
little effect on the depth of attack. The alkali-
metal base mixture containing UF, caused exces-
sive mass transfer and a very heavy intergranular
concentration of subsurface voids to a depth of
35 mils. The mass-transferred deposit in the cold
zone was up to 65 mils thick.

Mass transfer of large amounts of nickel metal
was found in the Inconel forced-circulation loop
that circulated molten sodium at 1500°F. Layers
of dendritic metal crystals up to 26 mils thick
were found to have formed in 1000 hr. The use of
type 316 stainless steel in the cold portions was
found to reduce the mass transfer slightly, but
further study of the variables in the process is
needed to confirm this finding.

Alkali-metal base mixtures containing combi-
nations of UF, and UF, were circulated in Inconel
thermal-convection loops, and, when about 2 wt %

uranium was present as U3? low depths of attacks
and no deposits were found. Higher U3* concen-
trations resulted in decreased attack, but hot-leg
layers were found.

Inconel thermal-convection loops in which ZF -
base fuels containing about 2 wt % uranium as
U3* were circulated did not show so large a re-
duction in attack as was found in the loops that
circulated alkali fluoride fuels also containing
2 wt % uranium as U3*. However, some reduction
in depth of attack and a fair reduction in amount
were found. The effect of the hot-leg temperature
(1200 to 1600°F) on mass transfer was investigated
in several Inconel thermal-convection loops oper-
ated for 1500 hr. A definite increase in depth of
attack with an increase in hot-leg temperature was
noted that may be attributed to mass transfer,
inasmuch as loops operated previously for 500 hr
did not show the effect of temperature on depth of
attack. The mass transfer effect is masked by
the effect of impurities and nonequilibrium conditions
during the first 500 hr.

Considerable work is being done in an effort to
find the cause of the increases in depth of attack
and the nonuniformity of results now being ob-
tained in Inconel thermal-convection loops operated
as control loops under standard conditions. Con-
tamination during filling or operation does not
appear to be the cause of the difficulty.

Corrosion tests of brazed type 310 stainless
steel T-joints in static sodium and in static NaF-
ZrF,-UF, (53.5-40-6.5 mole %) showed the brazing
alloy 9% Si-2.5% P-88.5% Ni to be satisfactory
in both mediums. Similar tests of brazed ‘‘A”
nickel T-joints showed the following brazing alloy's

to be satisfactory in both mediums: 90% Ni-10% P,

80% Ni-10% Cr-10% P, and Nicrobraz. Seesaw

corrosion tests in both mediums on brazed Inconel
T-joints showed the Coast Metals alloy No. 52 to

“fluoride mixture.
© Since the structural metal alloys ‘that have been
“proposed for use in the fabrication of reactor fuel

and coolant lines have a tendency to form solid-
phase bonds at elevated temperatures in liquid
metals and in fused salts, they are unsuitable for

use in valves, bearings, and seals. Therefore
~ cermets and ceramics that do not bond to each
other but that can be bonded to the structural metal

alloys are being investigated. The cermets (metal-
bonded ceramics) appear to be the more promising

} PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1955

because of their high corrosion resistance and
other satisfactory chemical and physical properties.
Several Kentanium cermets tested in NaF-ZrF -
UF, (53.5-40-6.5 mole %) at 1500°F for 100 hr were
found to have good resistance to solid-phase
bonding if the contact pressure between the speci-
mens did not exceed 50,000 psi. The compositions
of the cermets tested were:

80 wt % TiC-10 wt % NbTaTiC,-10 wt % Ni
70 wt % TiC-10 wt % NbTaTiC,~20 wt % Ni
64 wt % TiC~6 wt % NbTaTiC,-30 wt % Ni
64 wt % TiC~6 wt % NbTaTiC,~
25 wt % Ni=5 wt % Mo

Lithium was circulated in two stainless steel
thermal-convection loops for periods of 1000 and
3000 hr, respectively. The hot- and cold-leg tem-
peratures were 1000 and 550°F, respectively.
Operation was satisfactory throughout the test
periods, and macroscopic examination revealed no
mass-transferred crystals in the loops or in the
lithium drained from the loops. Metallographic
examination revealed subsurface voids and a
ferritic surface layer 0.3 to 1.0 mil thick in the
loop operated for 1000 hr and 1.0 to 1.5 mils thick
in the loop operated for 3000 hr. Lithium metal
had penetrated to the depth of the subsurface voids.
The weld zone of the pipe was attacked to a depth
of 3 mils in the 1000-hr test and 4 to 5 mils in the
3000-hr test. A few small (0.2-mil) carbide par-
ticles were found attached to the wall in the cold-
leg sections of both loops.

Determinations of the oxidation rate of sodium

" have been made at —79, —20, 25, 35, and 48°C.

The experimental results indicate that, contrary
to current oxidation theory, the oxide films formed
on sodium are highly protective in the absence of
water vapor. The rate curves do not conform to

any of the ‘‘standard’’ rate equations reported in
oo “the literature, but they are qualitatively comparable
to low-temperature curves for copper. It is hoped

to clarify the oxidation mechanism associated with
a linear rate law through a careful study of the
structure and composition of the oxide films formed
on columbium in the neighborhood of 400°C.
Studies of corrosion and mass transfer by fused

“hydroxides indicate that both nickel and Inconel

may possibly be compatible with hydroxides at
temperatures of about 600°C. Hastelloy B is
unsatisfactory because of its poor corrosion re-

sistance. In the temperature range 600 to 700°C,
there is evidence of an accelerated rate of mass
transfer with both nickel and Inconel, as well as
corrosion of Inconel.

The BeF,-bearing mixtures LiF-BeF, {69-31
mole %) and LiF-BeF,-UF, (67.3-30.2-2.5 mole %)
were tested in Inconel capsules in 100-hr tilting
furnace tests. No evidence of attack by either
mixture was found. A study of the effect on cor-
rosion of the ratio of UF; to UF, in various
solvents revealed that increasing the UF, content
up to 50% was beneficial and that any further
increase had little effect.

‘6. Metallurgy and Ceramics

Investigations were continued in the study of the
properties of nickel-base alloys containing 15 to
32% molybdenum, ternary alloys with a nickel-
molybdenum base, and Hastelloy B. Attempts are
being made to improve Hastelloy B with regard to
fabricability, oxidation resistance, and mechanical
properties. Additional evidence has been obtained
which indicates that the poor high-temperature
fabricability of the commercial material is related
to the impurity content; however, it is felt that the
superior strength of commercial Hastelloy B may
be derived from the impurities. Therefore mechani-
cal property tests are under way on an alloy with
the nominal Hastelloy B composition, 4% Fe—28%
Mo—-68% Ni, but without the tramp elements va-
nadium, silicon, manganese, cobalt, chromium,
tungsten, and aluminum,

A tube blank extruded from a vacuum-melted cast
billet of commercial Hastelloy B fractured during
the first step of a reduction operation; however,
a blank made from a wrought billet was success-
fully reduced from 1.5-in.-OD, 0.250-in.-wall to
0.187-in.-0OD, 0.017-in.-wall seamless tubing. Two
impact extrusions of as-cast vacuum-melted com-
mercial Hastelloy B were made at 2000°F .with
good recovery of sound rod. Attempts to roll the
rod at 2000°F were, however, unsuccessful; the
material cracked severely.

Design curves were prepared from the results
of creep-rupture tests of Hastelloy B sheet in the

“solution-annealed condition in an argon atmosphere

at 1500 and 1650°F. A comparison of these data
with preliminary ‘data from tests in fused salts
shows that properties of the alloy in the fused
salts are actually superior to the properties in an

“argon atmosphere. Creep tests in air, in argon,

and in hydrogen at 12,000 psi showed the effects
of argon and hydrogen to be similar, but the effects
of air followed closely the pattern observed for
Inconel and “A” nickel in air, insofar as reduced
creep rate and longer rupture life are concerned.
However, the final elongations of Hastelloy B in
air are equivalent to or lower than those in argon,
whereas the elongations of other nickel-molybdenum
alloys are markedly greater in air than in argon.

A program has been initiated to determine whether
aging treatment results in serious embrittlement
at service temperatures. Typical microstructures
have been obtained from specimens heat-treated
at temperatures from 1100 to 1600°F for times from
100 to 1000 hr, and a correlation is to be made
between physical properties and the microstruc-
tures. The relative merits of various preaging heat
treatments of Hastelloy B are also being studied,
and it is hoped that, as a result of this work, a
procedure can be developed that will stabilize the
microstructure sufficiently to reduce the sensitivity
to high-temperature aging.

The binary nickel-molybdenum alloys that have
been studied have included 15 to 32% molybdenum,
and the ternary alloys contained 20% molybdenum
plus nickel and one of the following: 3 to 10% chro-
mium, 2 to 10% columbium, 2% aluminum, 1% tita-
nium, 2% vanadium, or 1% zirconium. The results
of stress-rupture tests have shown low strengths
and ductilities for most of these alloys and indi-
cate that vacuum melting alone is not sufficient
to obtain optimum properties. The possibility of
increasing the strength and ductility through cerium
additions appears to be promising, since the ad-
dition of cerium has been shown to improve the
physical properties of the alloy. It has become
apparent that improved deoxidation practices are
necessary in melting these alloys, and efforts are
being directed toward the production of sounder
ingots.

Oxidation tests of nickel-molybdenum alloys
containing 3 to 10% chromium have shown that
about 10% chromium is necessary to form a non-
spalling protective oxide on the alloy. However,
the oxidation rate under static conditions can be
reduced 50% by the addition of 3% chromium.

Cyclic tests consisting of 190 air cools from
1500°F in 500 hr have now been completed for
brazing alloys previously evaluated in static
oxidation resistance tests at 1500 and 1700°F.
Most of the alloys tested showed good resistance

to oxidation under both static and cyclic con-
ditions. Cyclic tests at 1700°F are now under way
on these brazing alloys, which include commercial
alloys, experimental nickel-base alloys, and ex-
perimental precious-metal base alloys. Physical
property tests showed that the physical properties
of Inconel are not impaired by the brazing process.

The fabrication of several major experimental
heat transfer test components was completed. The
items fabricated included a 20-tube fuel-to-NaK
Inconel heat exchanger, a full-scale 200-tube fuel-
to-NaK heat exchanger (intermediate heat ex-
changer No. 2), two 500-kw NaK-to-air radiators,
and a full-scale integral-fin liquid metal-to-air
radiator designed by the Cornell Aeronautical
Laboratory. The combination welding and brazing
procedures used in the fabrication of these units
are described.

Three billets of vanadium were extruded at
2000°F. Tubing prepared from these blanks is to
be clad on the outside with stainless steel, and
the clad tubing will be used in corrosion studies.
Four high-purity molybdenum billets containing
0.7% titanium were extruded into rod to be used in
welding studies. Flow pattern studies of the
extrusion of duplex and three-ply composites were
continued. The three-ply materials are to be used
in the production of stainless-steel-clad seamless
tubular fuel elements. Attempts were made to clad
columbium with the following heat-resistant alloys:
types 446 and 310 stainless steel, Inconel, and
Hastelloy B. Columbium was found to be ade-
quately protected by each of these alloys, and the
effects on ductility were slight; however, interface
reactions occurred in afl combinations, and there

. was, asd result, separation at the interfaces. oo
Diffusion barriers for assuring bonding at “the
interface were therefore studied. “Preliminary evi-

Several type 310 stainless-steel-clad columbium
thermal-convection loops were fabricated. A two-
stage process was used in which the columbium
and stainless steel were welded in separate oper-
ations. A typical specimen of a spun Inconel
configuration fabricated to simulate the ART core
shell design was tested for dimensional stability
after thermal cycling. No recordable diametrical,
axial, or thickness instability was observed. A
method was developed for producing cermet-to-
Inconel joints with adequate ductility.

Ceramics composed of rare-earth oxides, which
combine the property of high absorption cross
section for thermal neutrons and the usual ceramic
properties of high density, strength, corrosion re-
sistance, and high melting temperature, were pre-
pared in the shapes required for testing in critical
assemblies to determine their possibilities as
control rod materials. The possibility of coating
uo, particles with Z:0, to protect the uo, from
reaction with molten silicon in an SiC-Si fuel
element is being investigated. Also, graphite-
hydrogen reactions are being studied.

7. Heat Transfer and Physical Properties

The friction factor as a function of Reynolds
modulus was determined experimentally for the
case of turbulently flowing NaF-ZrF ,-UF, (53.5-
40-6.5 mole %) in Inconel tubes; the results are
in agreement with conventional friction data, A
full-scale ART fuel-to-NaK heat exchanger was
studied as a water-to-water heat exchanger. Pre-
liminary measurements indicate that the heat
transfer coefficients on the fuel side of the ex-
changer, which has the controlling thermal resist-
ances in the system, are about 1.6 times lower than
would be obtained by the conventional relation for

"turbulent flow in circular-pipe systems; also, the

corresponding pressure drops were two times as

“high as those for flow in smooth pipes. Some
velocity profile data were obtained for the 18-in.

the ART core for momentary periods of flow

cal and an experimental study of a free-convection

average molecular weight. The viscosities of seven
fluoride mixtures were determined: namely, NaF-

LiF-ZrF,-UF,-UF, (20.9-38.4-35.7-4-1 mole %),
NaF-ZrF,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %), NaF-UF, (66.7-
33. 3 mole %), NaF-KF- UF, (46.5-26.0-27.5 mole %),
NaF- LiF- ZF, -UF, -UF, 20. 55-21-3.6-0.4 mole %),
NaF - LiF: ZiF, (2. 55. 23 mole %), and NaF-LiF-
BeF, (56-16- 8 mole %). From the viscosity

measurements that are now available for BeF,-
bearing fluoride mixtures, a relationship between
BeF, concentration and viscosity was investigated.
In general, the viscosity decreased as the BeF
concentration decreased. Some preliminary thermal-
conductivity data of a ZrF ,-bearing fluoride mix-
ture in the liquid state were obtained with a new
conductivity cell and are in agreement with previ-
ous data obtained with a different type of cell.

8. Radiation Damage

The program of MTR irradiations of Inconel cap-
sules designed for comparing UF,- and UF -base
fluoride fuels has continued. The results of exami-
nations made thus far have shown no evidence of
radiation damage in that there is no corrosion, no
significant segregation of uranium, and no changes
in the impurity content of the fluoride mixtures.
= The fluoride-fuel loop that was operated in the

~~ LITR horizontal beam-hole has been disassembled,

: and parts of it have been examined metallographi-
cally. Subsurface void attack of the Inconel tubing
used for the fuel loop was limited to less than 1
mil in depth. The fission products Ru'®? and
Nb?S were found to have plated out in two sections
of the loop, and thus partial substantiation of a
“similar occurrence in the ARE was obtained.

The small “loop intended for operation in a verti-
cal ‘hole in the LITR has been charged with fuel

and is now in the final stages of assembly for the
in-pile test. Data which were obtained for three
different sizes of charcoal traps to delay fission
gases from the small loop in the event of rupture
were positively correlated. Two charcoal traps
have been incorporated in the cooling-air off-gas
line.

A tube-burst stress-corrosion apparatus has been
assembled and awaits filling prior to irradiation
in the LITR, and an LITR-irradiated stress-cor-
rosion rig is ready to be examined in the hot
cells. The creep apparatus installed in the MTR
has just completed six weeks of irradiation and is
ready to be returned to ORNL for postirradiation
measurements.

An equation describing the behavior of the xenon
poisoning in a fluid-fueled reactor was derived
and was applied to the ART design. The calcu-
lations indicate that the removal of xenon by
sparging with helium will be a satisfactory means
of controlling xenon poisoning in the ART. Also,
no difficulties appear to exist in connection with
shutdown poisoning at the sparging rates selected
for ART operation.

9. Analytical Chemistry of Reactor Materials

Apparatus was calibrated for the determination
of uranium metal in fluoride salts by the method
in which the metal is converted to UH, and subse-
quently ignited in oxygen at 400°C to form water
and uo,. Samples of UF, and KF-UF, were then
analyzed. The coefficient of variation was 7% for
the range 6 to 60 mg of uranium. No interference
from the presence of either fluoride salts or tri-
valent uranium was encountered, and therefore the
procedure should be applicable to all types of
fluoride fuels.

A comparison of the methylene-blue and hydro-
gen-evolution methods for the determination of tri-
valent uranium in LiF-BeF,, NaF-LiF, and NaF-
BeF, base fuels was made. Satisfactory agreement
of the methods was observed for these materials;
however, the results for trivalent uranium in a
KF base obtained by the methylene-blue method
showed negative bias when compared with those
from the hydrogen-evolution method. Methylene-
blue solutions which were 1.5 to 6 M with respect
to HCi were shown to be reduced to methylene
white at room temperature by finely divided metallic
chromium, iron, nickel, and uranium-nickel alloy.

Studies were continued on the simultaneous

in fluoride salts. The postulation of an interaction
species of pentavalent uranium and methylene
white was investigated.

By using an anion-exchange resin in the hy-
droxide form to retain zirconium, beryllium, urc-
nium, and sulfate ions, the quantitative separation
of alkali metal ions was rapidly effected. Determi-
nation of the alkali metal concentration was made
by titration of the free base which results from the
anion resin exchange. When more than one alkali
metal was present, the 2-ethyl-1-hexanol procedure
was applied to the determination of lithium, and
the tetraphenyl boron method was applied to the
determination of potassium. Sodium was determined
by difference methods.

A rapid volumetric method for the determination
of zirconium in fluoride salts was proposed. In
this method, which is a modification of the method
of Fritz and Johnson, a standard solution of
disodium dihydrogen ethylenediaminetetraacetate
is used to complex zirconium, and the excess re-
agent is back-titrated with iron(lll), with disodium-
1,2-dihydroxybenzene-3,5- disulfonate as the indi-
cator.

The bromination method for the determination of
oxygen as oxide was applied to samples of CrF,
and Na,ZrF,. Further tests were made on the
electrolysis method for this determination. A
modification of the Winkler method for the determi-
nation of oxygen in water was applied to determine
the oxygen in the off-gases from the electrolysis.
The oxygen is absorbed in a solution of Mn(OH),
and Kl, which, upon acidification, liberates a
quantity of iodine equivalent to that of oxygen.
The iodine is determined spectrophotometrically
by extracting it with orthoxylene.

coupons held in the nickel reaction vessel during
the 20 fluorination runs showed corrosion of the
solution type that was even over all surfaces,
including welds, in contact with the molten salt.
Severe local pitting was noted that varied in depth
up to 19 mils on the fluorine gas inlet tube in the
vapor zone above the molten salt. The attack on
this tube in the liquid zone was more uniform, and
varied from 4 to 7.5 mils in depth. The reaction
vessel showed nonuniform attack of the solution
type that varied from 5 to 9 mils in both the liquid
and gas zones.

At either 200 or 650°C, CaF, was much less
efficient than NaF at 650°C in removing volatilized
ruthenium from the UF-F, gas. However, results
of runs made under various conditions indicated
that the temperature, size, and conditioning of the
NaF bed are very important,

The engineering flowsheet for the ARE fuel
recovery pilot plant is 85% complete. Design of
10 of the anticipated 29 process equipment pieces
is complete, and the pieces have been ordered.

PART IH. SHIELDING RESEARCH
11. Shielding Analysis

A semianalytical Monte Carlo calculation has
been initiated to determine the history of all gamma
radiation born within a circulating-fuel reactor.
All shells of the core, reflector, and shield will
be taken into account, but the calculation will be
simplified by the assumptions that the reactor has
spherically symmetric geometry and that all regions
are homogeneous. The results will include de-
terminations of the energy absorbed and of the
energy spectrum and angular distribution of the

_ gamma rays penetrating the shield.

The coding of a Monte Carlo calculation of the
energy absorption resulting from gamma radiation

incident on a multiregion shield with slab geometry

is nearing completion. The original code has been
revised, and the calculation should now provide
good statistics for gamma rays incident on a
shield with a thickness of approximately seven
mean free paths.

~ The coding of a Monte Carlo calculation of the
energy and angular distribution of air-scattered

 

cL neutrons from a monoenergetic source is also

nearing completion. Modifications in the original
problem moke it possible to perform calculations
for surface sources having angular variation in

cosine of the angle to the normal and then by a
~~ suitable combination to duplicate the distribution
~ from the surface of a sphere such as a circulating-
fuel reactor.

The analysis of the constant-velocity transport
‘equation has been extended with the aid of eigen-
functions of the various media.

qa, Lid Tank Shielding Facility

The static source tests in the second series of
“experiments with mockups of a circulating-fuel
~ reflector-moderated reactor and shield are in
progress. The mockups consisted of the following
regions: Inconel core shell, beryllium reflector,
first boron curtain, heat exchanger, second boron
curtain, pressure shell, and a lead-water shield.
Gamma-ray dose rate measurements beyond mock-
ups with variations of these regions have shown
that (1) a Ye in. thickness of boral for the first
curtain decreases the dose as much as a 13,-in.-
thick boral first curtain would; (2) the dose is
decreased with an increase in heat exchanger
thickness; (3) there is appreciable gamma-ray
production in and beyond large uniform thicknesses
of lead in the mockup; (4) only an attenuation
effect is observed when pressure shell material
(that is, nickel) is added; and (5) the dose is
increased 10% by the addition of 0.125-in.-thick
Inconel cladding on the first boron curtain. A
measurement of the distribution of the thermal-
neutron flux within the 12-in.-thick beryllium re-
flector showed that the flux peaked at about
4, in. of beryllium. Neutron measurements as a
function of the lead region thickness revealed that

 

an increase in lead thickness effectively only
moved the thermal and epithermal flux outward
from the source. A study of the activation within
the heat exchanger was also carried out, and, on
the basis of this study, a calculation for a 300-Mw
airplane reactor indicated that a 2000-curie acti-
vation is fo be expected in the NaK. For an un-
shielded NaK-to-air radiator this would give 16
rem/hr at 60 ft.

13. Bulk Shielding Facility
A mockup of the swept-back air-duct system for
the GE-ANP reactor was tested at the Bulk Shield-
ing Facility (BSF). The mockup consisted of a
“pair of annular ducts that represented a segment
of the duct system around the airplane reactor. A

10

long inlet duct and a shorter outlet duct were
placed against, and on opposite sides of, the BSF
reactor, which was modified with GE-type transition
sections. Both ducts curved to the right, and the
shorter one nested within the longer one so that
they ran roughly parallel. Measurements of the
radiation leaking out the end of the large duct as
the distance between the ends of the ducts was
varied (that is, as the large duct was moved out)
showed no evidence of streaming down the entire
length of the large duct. Fast-neutron dose rate
measurements beyond the shield and parallel to
the last leg of the large duct were not affected by
the position of the duct. Angular distribution
measurements around a fixed point beyond the
ducts showed no evidence of fast neutrons escaping
from any portion of the large duct.

14. Tower Shielding Facility

Differential-type shielding experiments have
continued at the Tower Shielding Facility (TSF)
with emphasis on measurements of the fast-neutron
dose rate distribution within the detector tank and
the GE-ANP crew compartment held at a separation
distance of 64 ft from the reactor tank. This
distribution was determined as a function of vari-
ations in the reactor shield thickness, crew com-
partment thickness, and angle of radiation emission
from the reactor tank. The measurements, which
were made at a height of 195 fi, are presented in
this report.

A method is presented for interpretation of the
TSF differential shielding experiments in terms of
the probability of fast neutrons scattering into the
sides of a crew compartment of an aircraft divided
shield. The effect of beam collimation on the
experimental results, as indicated by single air-
scattering calculations, is discussed. An indi-
cation is obtained from the experiments of the
effect of the neutron energy spectrum on the dose-
scattering probability.

The results and interpretation of the TSF dif-
ferential shielding experiments were used to
calculate the fast-neutron dose rate for a divided-
shield mockup which had been measured previously
at the TSF. The agreement between mockup
experimental results and the calculations based
on the differential experiments was good, in view
of the various uncertainties existing at this time.
In making the comparison, procedures were de-
veloped for using the experimental results in dose

The preliminary layout of the interior of the
reactor cell for the Aircraft Reactor Test (ART)
which shows the major items of equipment and the
recommended provisions for support was completed.
A similar layout for the NaK piping and radiators
was also completed. It has been established that
five bulkheads will be required in the tank and
cell walls for instrument and control wiring, piping,
and miscellaneous service lines. Consideration
has been given to the design of the addition to
Building 7503 required for the ART, the layout of
the blower house, and the electrical power system,
distribution, and auxiliary equipment. Mounting
arrangements have been described for the radiators,
for the fill and drain tanks, for the inner and outer
reactor cells, and for structurally attaching the
reactor assembly to the cell, dump lines, NaK
piping, and other service and instrumentation lines.
The type of equipment by which oxygen will be
removed from the inner cell has been specified.

The basic requirements of the heat dump system
and the instrumentation and control thereof have
been specified. The ART heat dump system is to
provide heat dissipation capacity of 60 Mw of heat

with a mean temperature level of 1300°F in the

NaoK system. The most convenient, inexpensive,
and compact heat dump has been found to be a
round-tube, plate-fin radiator core. This basic
type of heat transfer surface has been found to be
sufficiently reliable in heat exchanger test rigs.

“established for the prevention of failure” of the
“Inconel core and reflector shells during operation

of the ART. The core shells are to be %- in.-thick

Inconel. They are to be cooled on one side with

 
 

flowing sodium in order to maintain the shells
everywhere below 1500°F. The reflector shell
is to be maintained below 1300°F by surrounding
it with a layer of boron-bearing material, a gas
space to serve as a heat dam, and an Inconel
cladding layer to separate it from the hot fuel in
the heat exchanger. To prevent buckling of the
outer core shell because of external radial pres-
sure differences and to prevent excessive de-
formation of the reflector shell because of ex-
cessive pressure differences, the pressures in the
sodium coolant system and in the fuel are to be
adjusted to be approximately equal at a point
halfway through the primary heat exchanger. In
order to limit cyclic thermal stresses, the tempera-
ture difference across the shells is not to exceed
300°F. Stress and heat transfer analyses are far
from complete, but tentative pressures have been
established for the fluid circuits.

In case of a failure of apart of the reactor
system, for instance a fuel pump, during operation,
it may be necessary to maintain emergency con-
ditions for short periods in which the pressure
differences across the shells will be much greater
than those existing during normal overation. Calcu-
lations indicate that these conditions can be
maintained without sudden failure of the shells
by buckling or rupture. However, the total life of
the reactor for normal operation will be dispro-
portionately shortened.

moderator cooling system have been set forth,

substantial thicknesses of concrete and dirt. The

The operation of forced-circulation, high-tempera-
ture-differential, Inconel loops with fuel mixtures
of interest has demonstrated that the velocity of
the circulated fluid has little effect on corrosion
and mass transfer and that the results of the
numerous thermal-convection loop tests are appli-
cable to the dynamic ART system.

One in-pile forced-circulation Inconel loco that
circulated a fuel mixture in the LITR has been
examined, and radiation was found not to have
a detrimental effect on corrosion and mass transfer;
a second loop will be operated in the LITR during
the next quarter. An in-pile loop that will more
closely simulate the ART conditions is to be
operated soon in the MTR,

Experiments with sodium in Inconel loops have
thus far indicated unsatisfactorily high mass
transfer, but it is thought that better purification
and handling of the sodium will greatly decrease
the mass transfer; also, the use of stainless steel
in the cold portions of the system is being in-
vestigated.

Cermets for use as valves, bearings, and seals
are undergoing intensive self-bonding and cor-
rosion resistance tests, and procedures for brazing
cermets to Inconel have been developed.

Studies of experimental nickel-molybdenum base
alloys and commercial Hastelloy B, in particular,
have indicated possibilities of finding a structural
material with properties superior to those of
Inconel for circulating-fuel reactor application,

but some of the problems involved are of such
a magnitude ‘that it is not thought that such ma-

Shielding Facility will provide much of the data
needed for final design of the reactor and, in
particular, the shielding. A mockup of the reactor
and shield is being used to determine activations
within the heat exchanger and the effect on dose
rates at various locations of varying materials and
thicknesses of materials. The activation of the
NaK within the heat exchanger is of particular
importance because of the effect it will have on
dose rates at the NaK-to-air radiators, which are
outside the reactor shield.

Design of the engineering flow sheet of a fuel
recovery oilot plant is 85% complete. It is hoped
that the rapid reprocessing and recovery of fuel
that would be required under service conditions
can be demonstrated with this pilot plant.

The many calibration and ocerformance tests
scheduled for the ART are summarizedin Table 1.2.
Some of the tests can be run in the course of the
endurance tests, which should consist first of
25 simulated flight cycles (16 hr at full power and
8 hr at from 1 to 10% power) and then of 100 hr
of continuous operation at full power. This will
give a total of 500 hr at full power and 200 hr at
low power during the endurance test period. It is
expected that the preliminary calibration and
performance tests can be carried out during the
first 400 hr of operation, with allowances for
servicing and maintenance. In reviewing the
design requirements and the tests planned for the
ART, it is evident that many modifications could
be made in the test conditions to vary the severity
of the test. The key variables, together with the
desired values for the test, are given in Table 1.3.

design data, Additional simulator work will also
be done at ORNL.

Control Principles

The control system is to provide automatic cor-
rective action for emergencies requiring action too
rapid to permit operator deliberation. Automatic
interlocks will prevent inadvertent dangerous oper-
ation, with minimum operator limitation. Operation
in the design power range will be independent of
nuclear instrumentation and will have only limited
dependence (for safety) on other instrumentation
during power transients. Three classes of emer-
gencies will be provided for:

1. those requiring automatic rod insertion, load

“removal, and fuel dump,

2. ‘those requiring only automatic rod insertion and

18

load removal (followed by manual dump at oper-
ator’s discretion),

3. those requiring only operator warning and manual
action.

One-half the wind tunnel blowers and one-half
the pumps (of each type) will be powered by com-
mercial supply. The remaining blowers and pumps
will be powered by a deisel system. Duplicate
fuel and sodium pumps have been provided for
safety, but if any one of these four pumps failed,
the output of each of the remaining three pumps
would have to be decreased to prevent pump cavi-
tation or pressure overstressing of the Inconel core
shells in the current design, The basic control
actions provide for this depression of output, but
it is questionable whether pump speeds can be de-
creased fast enough to prevent adverse transient
conditions. For example, the Inconel may be over-

in creep rate. To prove at least that the reactor
can be safely scrammed after such a pump failure,
it is planned to include cutting off the commercial
power {or diesel) at design point (60 Mw) as a part
of the test procedure. This will constitute a class
1 emergency, as defined above.

The control rod cannot be abruptly inserted in
the case of an emergency, because to do so and
yet prevent the fuel from freezing or getting too hot
would require accurate transient matching of ab-
sorbed power and flux power, which would be im-
practical to accomplish. Therefore a scram (class
1 or class 2 emergency) will abruptly insert the rod

only enough to reduce Ak/k by 1%. This will be

followed by automatic insertion at the rate of 1%

also “choose ‘slow’’ rod movement of 1% Ak/k in

5 min. Below 10-Mw power operation, the operator

will be automatically limited to the slower rate.
The 1% scram will automatically cut off one-half

the blowers to reduce the load. The load will then
be further reduced by automatic closing of the

 

signal for the NaK-to-air radiator outlet temperature.

Since the design point occurs at the high temper-
ature limit (1600°F) for the fuel, accurate limiting
will be required. In addition to thermocouples in
the fuel, the maximum fuel temperature will be

thermocouple signals by using heat exchanger
calibration data, The dependability of fuel-temper-
ature-sensing thermocouples is questionable be-
cause of the poor conductivity of the fuel and the
high gamma-ray heating.

Operating Procedure

The reactor is to be initially filled with barren
(without uranium) fuel carrier to check out the
system. This will be done with the system iso-
thermal at 1200°F and all NaK and sodium pumps
operating, Electric heaters will supply the heat
needed beyond that produced by pump work dis-
sipating, After the checkout of the system, part
of the barren carrier will be removed and replaced
with fuel-enriched material to provide 80% of the
calculated critical amount of U235., Criticality
will be checked, and the fuel will be further en-
riched in steps until criticality is obtained. The
control rod will be calibrated in the process, A
flux servo will then be available for holding the
reactor at very low power levels (under 10 kw)
during low-power experimentation. At these levels
the temperature coefficient will be inadequate for
good control because of the high thermal capacity
of the system,

The minimum power level for control by the
temperature coefficient is expected to be about
300 kw — the estimated heat removal by the radia-
tors with the heat barrier doors open and no air
flow. To take the reactor to the 300-kw level, it
will manually be put on not less than a 20-sec
positive period, and the barrier doors will be
opened when the flux level reaches a set value
equivalent to something less than 300 kw. If the
doors were opened too soon or too late, excessive
power surges might occur before the flux stabilized
and there might possibly be damaging thermal
shocks. After stabilization at 300 kw, the control

“vod will be slowly adjusted to bring the mean fuel

temperature to 1200°F (it will have gone somewhat

"above this).

To increase the power above 300 kw, the blowers
will be turned on and the shutters opened as de-

"sired. The control rod will be used to adjust the

mean fuel temperature. Automatic limiters will
close the shutters if the minimum NaK temperature
drops below about 1050°F (to prevent fuel freezing)
and will open them if the minimum NaK temperature
goes above 1300°F (to dissipate afterheat and pre-

will require that the mean fuel temperature be set
above 1200°F (it must be set at 1425°F to take out
60 Mw). Below about 6 to 10 Mw, the heat dump
will have to be adjusted slowly to avoid high flux

“and temperature surges. Above this power the

temperature coefficient is expected to permit
reasonably fast (for jet engines) load changes
without excessive transient surges.

REACTOR PHYSICS

Probable Effect of Replacing Inconel
by Columbium in the ART Core Shells

Ww. K. Ergen
Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

The cold critical experiments for the ART have
shown? that the critical mass decreases very
rapidly as the neutron absorption in the core shell
decreases. Hence, replacement of the highly ab-
sorbing Inconel by a low-cross-section material,
such as columbium,® would bring about a sub-
stantial saving in uranium investment and, inci-
dentally, make the temperature coefficient more
negative, For corrosion and fabrication reasons,
only about 50% of the Inconel can be replaced by
columbium. The effect of this 50% replacement has
been calculated on the basis of recent data from
the cold critical experiments and measurements of
resonance capture integrals.4

From the critical experiments it is concluded
that the epicadmium flux is about the same for the
core shell and for the fuel. From the capture

‘resonance integrals of Inconel and columbium,

respectively, and the fission resonance integral of
U235, it is computed, for the epicadmium range,
that the columbium absorptions amount to 1.6% of
the fissions, whereas the absorptions in the re-
placed Inconel amounted to 2.4%.

For the ‘'below-cadmium’’ neutrons the cold

critical experiments are consistent with the model

that the shells absorb neutrons according to the
thermal cross sections and that all neutrons pass
through the shells perpendicularly, By using the
1/v extrapolation to get the 1400°F absorption

cross sections, the columbium absorbs 0.5% of the
neutrons, whereas the replaced Inconel absorbs
3%.

The experimental result that the epicadmium
neutron group and the subcadmium neutron group
each contribute about 50% of the fissions then
indicates that effectively 1.65% of the neutrons
would be saved by the replacement, |f

(AR/EY/ (AM/M) = 1/10

is assumed, the saving in critical mass would be
about 16.5%, or 4 kg, corresponding to 0.7 mole %

“in uranium concentration of the fuel and 7 kg in

total U235 investment.

As a check, the above method can be used to
compute the effect of completely eliminating, in the
cold critical assembly, he in, of the core shell.
The result would be a 41% saving in critical mass,
compared with the experimental value of 45%. In
another room-temperature critical experiment (cf,
Sec. 3, ‘‘Critical Experiments’), 127.4 g of the
Inconel core shell was replaced by 98.5 g of
columbium. The effect calculated by the above
method would have been 2.5 cents, and the experi-
mental result was 3.6 cents,

ART Temperature Coefficient
L. T. Anderson

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

A calculation of the ART temperature coefficient
showed a positive contribution resulting from the
decrease of the absorption cross section of the
Inconel core shells3 with increasing neutron energy.
The smaller Inconel cross section allows more
neutrons to enter the fuel annulus and thus increase
the reactivity. It seems justified toassumeal/v
cross section for the Inconel on the basis of the
experimentally measured value of the resonance
integral, and therefore, if an increase, AT, of the
beryllium temperature causes a neutron energy
increase proportional to AT, the fractional cross-
section decrease of the shells is Y AT/T, and
the number of fissions is increased by the factor

% (AT/T)Z,, x shell thickness x cadmium fraction

if only the subcadmium neutrons are affected and
the neutrons are incident normal to the shell.
Actually, the thickness of the Inconel that the
the neutrons go through is somewhat greater than
that of the shell, on the average, but this is at
least partially offset by the cross section of

of the subcadmium neutrons. The value of Ak/k
calculated in this way is +1.7 x 10-5 AT (°F) for

Reece? and Ergen (above), core shells of materials

where f is the fraction of thermal neutrons incident

The effect of beryllium expansion is considered
by using, as a model for the reactor, a sphere
(radius, R,) of noncapturing beryllium with a high
energy neutron shell source at R,. The source
neutrons slow down according to age theory, and
the slowing down density at thermal age is used
as a source for the thermal diffusion equation. It
is assumed that at thermal energy every neutron
striking the shell at R, is absorbed and causes a
fission. By using this model, Ak/k turns out to be>

Reactivity Effect of a Heat Exchanger Leak
A. M. Perry

Electronuclear Research Division

If the pressure in the NaK coolant circuit ex-
ceeds that in the fuel circuit, a leak in the inter-
mediate heat exchanger may first become apparent
through its effect on the reactivity of the ART.
The effect will be due to dilution of the fuel and
to increased parasitic absorption. It has been
suggested by the Advisory Committee on Reactor
Safeguards that the reactivity effect can be greatly
enhanced by adding lithium or Li6 to the NaK.
Preliminary experiments® indicate that perhaps
5 wt % lithium can be added to the NaK eutectic
without raising the melting point above 25°C,
The loss of reactivity due to parasitic absorption
is calculated on the assumption that

 

where [ equals (neutrons absorbed in fuel)/(neu-
trons absorbed in core), AZ, is the change in
poison cross section, and Z. is the fuel cross
section.

The loss of reactivity due to fuel dilution is
calculated on the assumption that

where V is the initial fuel volume, and AV the
volume of NaK leaked into the fuel circuit. The
factor Yeo is a conservative estimate based on

“critical experiment results.

The over-all reactivity loss, if AV is in cubic

if the coolant is NaK plus W wt % Lié, (Of course,
the approximations made are valid only for small
changes in reactivity and for small percentage
additions of lithium to the NaK.)

The maximum volume available before an over-
flow would occur will be 0.37 ft3, This volume of
NaK in the fuel circuit would produce a reactivity
change of 0.9%. The same volume of NaK plus
5 wt % lithium would produce a reactivity change
of 5%. A leak of 0.007 ft of NaK plus 5 wt %
Li6 would produce a reactivity loss of 1%.

Design work on the in-pile loop for operation
in the MTR has been completed, and the final loop
is being fabricated and assembled. A bench test
of a working mockup is under way. Twenty-two
high-velocity forced-circulation large-temperature-
differential loops were operated for investigating

“the corrosion and mass transfer of Inconel by
fluoride fuel mixtures under dynamic conditions.
Six similar loops were operated to test mass trans-
fer in Inconel and stainless steel loops in which
sodium is circulated,

A full-scale model of the ART fuel pump was
tested with water, and performance characteristics
were obtained. A test stand for high-temperature
tests has been designed. A test stand for inter-
mediate heat exchangers (100-tube bundle) is being
assembled, and tests are under way with a stand
designed for testing small-scale (20-tube bundle)
heat exchangers.

Flow patterns are being studied in a full-scale
model of the proposed 21-in. reactor core and en-
trance header. Several modifications are to be
tried in an attempt to prevent flow separation in
the core.

A thermal-cycling test was made on a sodium-
Inconel-beryllium system, and apparatus for a
third test is being assembled. A small-scale gas-
fired heat source was operated successfully at a
power output of 100 kw, and minor modifications
were planned that will increase the capacity.

‘simulated the loop were irradiated for 3 hr at about
5 Mw. Plans to make measurements at full power
were abandoned because an excessively long ir-

radiation was required to override the effects of
the minimum period in which the reactor could be
brought to full power. Gold foils irradiated at the
low power and again at full power in a vertical
hole adjacent to HB-3 provided a means for exira-
polating the data to full power.

This measurement made it possible to evaluate
the effect of materials and geometry of the in-pile
loop on the flux, Values obtained from foils inside
the fuel tube were consistent with other data taken
from foils irradiated in Inconel tubes by using a
rabbit facility for irradiation in hole HB-3. Other
data on the depression of flux in Inconel tubes
with a fuel mockup present were also used to esti-
mate the flux for the MTR in-pile loop.

The flux seen by the fuel in the in-pile ioop is
now expected to be 30% of the unperturbed value.
The heater loop, or nose section, originally de-
signed for a depression of 50%, has been modified
to obtain more power, The present nose section
consists of a 2) turn helical coil shaped, in out-
line, somewhat as a truncated cone. It is mounted
with its axis parallel to the beam hole center line
and with the small end forward. This will permit
the nose to be placed in the most forward position
possible by utilizing the concial end of the water
jacket. The developed length of the coil is slightly
over 3 ft. A total power generation of 24 kw is
required for the design conditions: Reynolds
number, 5,000; temperature differential, 200°F,
The average power density in the nose section,
on this basis, will be 0.7 kw/cm®; however, this
value may be conservative. Provision is being
made to change the loop position in the beam hole
during operation and thus utilize the flux gradient
to adjust the power. A higher power density may
be feasible for later loops.

sorbed gas will be analyzed for total krypton. After

shaft extension and the pump housing. This rub-
bing is known to have occurred during preheating
of the pump and to have been caused by thermal
stresses induced by an unduly rigid pump mounting.
There was no evidence of zirconium fluoride vapor
in the rear pump housing beyond a point % in.
from the pump sump proper, and no salts were found
in the vent line after the test. A continuous helium
purge of this area of about 0.3 cth was used.
There was no evidence of oil in the fuel portion
of the pump, the measured oil seal leakage being
0.15 em® for the 1000 hr. ~ However, the pump
sump gas pressure was higher than the bearing
"housing pressure, which would tend to cause seal
leakage to be toward the bearing housing. The
shaft seal faces were in good condition and ap-
"parently could have operated for an additional

“1000 hr, or more.

The pump impeller that will be used in the in-
pile experiment is identical with the one used in
-the test described above. The bearing housing
and seal designs are different, however, in order
to overcome the problems of radiation damage to
the oil and to prevent leakage of fission gases.
Instead of the oil cooling, the shaft is cooled by
"-a copper spool on the shaft that operates in a he-

28

lium atmosphere with a close clearance to the
water-cooled housing. The pump bearings and seals
are drop-lubricated. To seal fission gases from
the oil in the hydraulic drive motor, two shaft seals
are employed, one between the pump sump and the
bearing housing and one between the bearing hous-
ing and the hydraulic motor. These are facestype
seals with metallic bellows for the flexible member.
The gas volumes in both the sump and the bearing
housing are purged with helium to further reduce
the possibility of oil contamination. The pump
housing also serves as a leaktight bulkhead in the
water jacket to seal the loop end from the bearing
housing and motor section of the water jacket.
This section between the pump bulkhead and the
intermediate bulkhead will be used to accumulate
the waste bearing and seal-lubricating oil. An
exploded view of this pump is shown in Fig. 2.2.

Difficulty is still being experienced with failure
of the rotating seals. This trouble is principally
associated with the bellows and with breakage
of the carbon rings. Replacement of the brass
bellows with stainless steel bellows and the ex-
ercise of greater care in assembly seem to have
improved the situation, The sliding surfaces have
given little, or no, trouble.

The operation of high-velocity forced-circu lation
large-temperature-differential loops for investigat-

ing the corrosion of Inconel by fluoride fuel mix
tures under dynamic conditions has become so
routine that operation can be scheduled, and the
schedules can be maintained for long periods with-
out serious interruption. Twelve loops have been
terminated following scheduled operation; five
loops were terminated short of scheduled operating
time because of various failures; and five loops
were started and are continuing in operation. A
summary of the typical operating conditions is
given in Table 2,1,

During the early part of the quatter, loop failures
were encountered because heater lugs were welded

to the tube wall in such a manner as to cause high
thermal stress concentrations and high electrical
current density in the lugs. Three identical
failures resulted before butt welds were sub-
stituted for axial bead welds to alleviate the con-
dition that caused the failures.

Two bearing failures resulted in an investigation
of the thrust bearings used in the pumps (model
LFB). This study indicated that the fits were too
tight, and new bearings with looser fits between
balls and races were obtained. No further bearing
failures have occurred.

Metallurgical examination of early direct-re-
sistance-heated loops in which the heated sections
were coiled revealed excessive attack on the com-
pression side of the bends. Temperature measure
ments showed the compression side of the wall to
be approximately 100°F hotter than the tension
side. Since the wall of the tubing on the tension
side of the bend would have become thinner during
bending and the wall on the compression side
thicker, it was thought that the greater current
density of the thicker wall on the compression
side could have caused the overheating and the
resultant excessive corrosion. An investigation’
of flow revealed that poor fused-salt flow distri-
bution ot and past the bends resulted in poor heat
transfer and thus also caused overheating. A new
heated section was therefore designed that elimi-
nated bends from the sections that carried high
current and provided approximately 40 diameters

the length of the heated section in the resistance.
heated loops was increased from 12 ft to approxi-
mately 17 ft in order to reduce the maximum tube
wall temperature to a more tolerable level, These
modifications appear to have corrected the over-
heating and resultant excessive corrosion,

tube wall temperature on corrosion and mass trans-
fer. Loops 4935-5 and 4935-6 are the first two of

Four loops with sodium in Inconel and two loops
with sodium in Inconel and type 316 stainless
steel were operated and terminated, The important
operating conditions for these loops are given in
Table 2.2, Since appreciable deposits of mass.
transferred material were found in the cold legs
of these loops, a controlled series of experiments
was initiated. The operating conditions for these
loops, which are now operating, are given in Table
2.3. These loops will provide information on the
effects of the oxygen content of the sodium, the
use of a cold trap, the use of a lower maximum
sodium temperature, and theuse of an all-stainless-
steel system.

Water Performance Tests

G. D. Whitman
R. L. Brewster M. E. Lackey
Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

A full-scale model of the ART fuel pump design
designated MF-2 was built, and water performance
data were obtained for several impeller designs
and pump suction conditions for a given discharge-
volute design. The discharge volute and the test
impellers were fabricated from brass, and a bearing
housing used for the model MF-1 tests? was adapted
for use in the rotary assembly. The unit was
driven by a direct-coupled, 15-hp, variable-speed,
d-c motor, The pump was installed in a test loop
built of 6-in. pipe with head and flow measuring
instrumentation and a throttling valve.

The first experiment was performed by using a
pump-suction configuration that simulated the re-
actor design. A box containing a flat plate 1 in.
below and paraliel to the pump-suction flange was
used. For the second test, the fiat plate was
removed and an 8-in. pipe was connected directly
to the pump suction. Since pump performance was
about the same in both tests, the remainder of the
experiments were conducted with the 8-in. suction
line.

data are representative of the best operation ob.
tained during the tests. The pump efficiencies are
not considered to be accurate on an absolute basis,
because the motor was not calibrated and the motor
efficiencies were obtained from the manufacturer's
computed data. It is estimated that the efficiency
of the pump, exclusive of seal and bearing losses,
is approximately 70% at the design point.

Data obtained by varying the running clearance
between the lower impeller shroud and the volute
indicated that the clearance could be in excess
of 0.040 in. without loss in performance at design
point. At low-flow high-head conditions, there was
approximately a 10% loss in head because of re-
circulation in the pump.

A cavitation problem persisted throughout the
experiments. At flows of over 400 gpm and speeds
in excess of 2000 rpm, a slight noise was detected
in the pump, and the intensity of this disturbance
increased with increased flow or speed above the
threshold values. However, no cavitation damage
has been detected in the pump, and the data do
not indicate a decrease in performance in the cavi-
tation region. The performance of the pump was
not altered by varying the suction pressure over
a range of —-5 to +15 psig; however, the intensity
of the noise could be suppressed by increasing
the system pressure. The suction conditions were
altered by changing the radius of the inlet eye
from Y to 1 in., and the impeller nut was rede-
signed to give better fluid guidance. Neither of

bearing loadings. The test apparatus consists of
an MF.2 rotary element to which a loading device
is attached at the impeller location. The pump
shaft rotates freely within the side-loading device.
Heat is applied at the lower region of the pump to
simulate gamma heating under actual operating
conditions. One phase of the test will consist in
an endurance run under simulated pump design
conditions, and the other phase, for which a dupli-
cate test assembly is to be used, will consist in
short tests for studying the following variables:
bearing loading, pump speed, lower shaft temper-
ature, rate of coolant flow, and time.

Mechanical Shakedown Test

W. L. Snapp J. J. W, Simon
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft

A few additional mechanical shakedown tests
were performed on the model ME-1 ART fuel pump.

34

The rotary element was operated continuously for
a period of 300 hr at 3800 rpm without achieving a
successful seal at the lower journal-bearing region.
ft was found that the oil leakage rate was nearly
constant at 1.8 in.3 per day. Although this rate is
not excessive, the goal of zero leakage was not
achieved, probably because the face of the journal
was not flat, No further testing of this model is
planned,

As part of the renovation of ARE-type sump
pumps for use in heat exchanger and other tests,
100-hr cold mechanical shakedown tests of the
rotary elements were conducted on five units. To
assist in the development of the metal-to-metal
seal for the model MF-2 pump, the floating Graph-
itar ring at the lower seal assembly was removed
and replaced, on two units, by a modified upper
seal bellows assembly. This modification made
a metal-to-metal lower seal assembly. One ele-
ment failed in the cold shakedown test because of
a faulty bellows convolution, but the other element

: cided to use a conventional “by-

was found to be very satisfactory in that no leak-
age was detected. The latter element was then
placed in operation at high temperature on a heat
exchanger test stand. After about 200 hr of hot
operation, a bearing hum developed and the unit
was replaced; however, up to that time, there had
been no oil leakage detected at this lower metal-
to-metal seal. Upon disassembly of the unit, the
seal surfaces were found to be in excellent con-
dition. As a result of this test, all additional
ARE-type pumps will have metal-to-metal seals
at the lower journal.

Design work has been completed, and fabrication
and assembly have been started on two mechanical
shakedown test stands for testing model MF-2
rotary assemblies,

2. leakage rates of the upper and lower seals
during actual pump operation at elevated tem-

The removal of pumping power, approximately
40 hp at the isothermal steady-state condition, is
to be obtained by constructing a water wall around
the pump tank. A movable furnace will be installed
between the pump tank and the water wall. It
should be possible to dissipate the pumping power
at an isothermal operating condition by lowering
the movable furnace and exposing a portion of the
hot tank wall to the water wall. The fluid flow in
this very short loop will be observed through ports
during operation with water,

Fo of each test are shown in Fig. 2, 4. The results

ficate that the pressure “drop is least when the

“the highest pressure drop. Staggering the spacers

inclining these ‘staggered spacers provided no
improvement, as would be expected.

A test of a small fuel-to-NaK heat exchanger
was started April 10, 1955, Pressure drop and
heat transfer data have been taken through the
fluoride mixture Reynolds number range 500 to
6300. Preliminary analyses of the data indicate
that the heat exchanger pressure drops are in good
agreement with pressure-drop and friction-factor
information obtained from recent water-pressure-
drop fests carried out on tube bundles with similar

CORE FLOW TEST

G. D. Whitman R. L. Brewster
Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

A full-scale model of the proposed 21-in. reactor

core and an entrance header have been fabricated

and checked for fluid flow reversal and/or stag-
nation, The model was installed in a loop con
taining a 1000-gpm water pump, and two entrance
lines were provided at the header to simulate the
reactor design. Data were taken at flows. that
provided a Reynolds number correlation of 1:1
between water flow rates and design fuel flow.

The core model was machined from aluminum
castings and was instrumented at 72 static pressure
and 18 probe points at nine elevations along the
vertical axis of the core. Direction-finding impact
tubes were used to traverse the core-shell region
at the probe points. There were two probe loca-
tions at each of the nine elevations and in the
enfrance header. A traverse was made from the
inner to the outer wall of the fluid passage to
obtain the direction of flow and a total pressure
profile. Static pressure measurements were taken
at the walls at each elevation, and the fluid ve-
locity was computed from the total and static
pressure data,

“+The data were taken in the upper half of the core,
“dnd a region of flow reversal was encountered
“arouiid the inner core shell.

This reversal ex-
tended approximately one quarter of the distance

i between the inner and outer shell surfaces and
. was not sensitive fo flows down to one-half the

design Reynolds number. Data were not taken at

... flows below this value,

The entrance geometry produced a large rotational

. component of velocity in the fluid entering the core,
and turning vanes are to be inserted to direct the

flow axially through the core volume, if intolerable
a “separation is ‘encountered at the outer core
shell surface above the equator, turbulators will
be attached to the surface in an attempt to reduce
this trouble.

Testing was not attempted at higher outputs be-
cause a modification of the gas injection ports to
reduce the pressure drop would have been neces-
sary. Preheating of the heat exchanger section
prior to sodium filling was accomplished by oper-
ating the burner at low power output and adding
cooling air downstream of the combustion chamber,
It was possible to maintain heat exchanger tube
temperatures in the 800 to 1200°F range by this
means. I

No difficulties were encountered except for the

failure of the spark-plug igniter and several plastic
thermocouple connectors because of the high
radiant heat emission from the combustion chamber
barrel. The gas flow to the burner was momen-
tarily interrupted several times in the course of
the test of reliability of relighting. No problems
arose prior to failure of the igniter mechanism,
mentioned above.

With a few minor repairs, the furnace can be put
into operation as a utility heat source. By en-
larging the gas injection ports (a minor modifica-
tion), the capacity of the furnace may be increased
considerably for any future application.

REFLECTOR-MODERATED-REACTOR
CRITICAL EXPERIMENTS

A series of experiments have been done on
several critical assemblies of the circulating-fuel
reflector-moderated reactor. These experiments
embodied a number of different configurations of
fuel and reflector, which were described in detail
previously, The latest of these modifications
consisted of a beryllium region surrounded by a
fuel layer, which, in turn, was enclosed by the
beryllium reflector. This configuration was ex-
tended, with reduced dimensions, on opposite sides
of the central reactor region to form “‘end ducts’
which simulate the entrance and exit fuel channels.
Some results of a variety of experiments which
were done with this assembly are presented here.

Reactivity Measurements
The fuel loading of the critical assembly was
such that it contained about 3% excess reactivity,

which was utilized for the evaluation of reactivity
changes: incurred by altering the structure and by

adding samples of materials of interest in the de-

ART Control Rod Materials. To provide bases
for the design of the control rod for the ART,
measurements were made on samples of several
possible components. A test volume was formed
by removing beryllium from a region 176 by 17 Ne
in. in cross section that extended 21.5 in. along
the axis of the assembly from one end to a point
0.72 in. beyond the equatorial plane. A loss in
reactivity of 19.1 cents resulted.

Consideration was also given to the thimble in
which the control rod would operate. Tubes of
different dimensions and materials were placed
within the test volume, and the concomitant de-
pressions in reactivity were determined. The
results are given in Table 3.1. |t is indicated that,
in the range of the measurements, the change in
reactivity depends more upon the quantity of
material present than upon its shape. A plot of
the loss in reactivity incurred by a sample as a
function of its linear density, that is, its mass
per unit length, is given in Fig. 3.1.

An evaluation was then made of the neutron ab-
sorption properties of a mixture of some of the
oxides of the rare-ecrth elements being considered

* for use as the poison in the control rod, Tests on
“solid cylinders and on a cylindrical annulus were

“made along the axis of the critical assembly in
© the test volume described above.

“oxides tested was the following:

a 3-in.-long cylindrical sample, 0.450 i in 58

cadmium fraction measured by gold-foil activation
was about 0.5. The measurement was then re-
peated with the sample covered by cadmium 0.02
in. thick, The values were 55.9 and 61.7 cents,
respectively. The cadmium alone reduced the re-
duced the reactivity 37.7 cents. From these data
it appears that about 43% of the reactivity decrease
is due to neutrons which penetrate the cadmium.
Inconel. A measurement, similar to that just
described, was made with an Inconel sample in

in reset, upon neutron energy. The sample was

be oriad: with a 0.02-in.-thick cadmium cover.
The effects, as poisons, of the Inconel and the
cadmium were measured singly and together at the
center of the beryllium island and in the fuel region
adjacent to the fuel reflector interface. (The ein.
Inconel core shell was reduced to J in. in thick-
ness in the region of this measurement.) The gold-
activation cadmium fractions at the two positions
were 0.57 and 0,33, respectively. The reactivity
changes are given in Table 3.4. The fractions of
the total change that are caused by neutrons
penetrating the cadmium are also tabulated.

Beryllium in the Fuel Region. Since the pres-
ence of beryllium in the circulating fuel stream
would be another possible way of reducing the
critical uranium concentration, an experiment was
devised for evaluating the effect of beryllium in

the fuel region of the critical assembly. One of
“the central fuel subassemblies that consisted of

27 uranium metal sheets (each 0.004, in, thick) and

ha in. thick) was modified

to effect a decrease in reactivity of 22.7 cents.

“The substitution of a sample of beryllium, 7%

x 27, x 1 in., for this uranium and Teflon resulted

in a net reactivity gain of 8.5 cents over the un-
“perturbed value. The addition of a ¥ -in.-thick
layer of Inconel completely around the beryllium
te reduced this net gain to 4.0 cents. An estimate of

© the effect of the Inconel-clad beryllium on the
concentration | is given by the observation that the
“removal of two of the remaining 20 uranium sheets
"further reduced the reactivity by 4.5 cents, that is,

“to a value slightly below that of the original array.
~The two sheets removed last were adjacent to the

beryllium sample and were of greater than average
importance.
Fuel in the End Ducts. One of the safety features

. of the high-temperature critical experiment presently
" “being designed, which is described below, is that
the liquid fuel can be removed by draining under
gravity. The degree of safety depends upon the

Three annular rings of fuel were successively
removed in 27-in. increments from one end duct,
and the rosulring decreases in reactivity were
noted, Each ring contained 825 g of U?3%, and
thus a total of 2.475 kg of U?35 was removed, The
losses in reactivity accompanying the removal of
the three rings are shown in Fig. 3.2, which also
gives the loss in reactivity per unit displacement,
or fuel sensitivity, averaged over each of the fuel
annuli removed.

Power Distributions

The relative fission rate distribution across the
fuel annulus was determined from the fission-
product activities collected on aluminum foils in
contact with the uranium. Exposures were also
made with the foils and the uranium enclosed in
0.02-in.-thick cadmium in order to obtain a measure:

of the energy distribution of the neutrons causing

fission. The locations of foil traverses within the
fuel section of the assembly are shown at the top
of Fig. 3.3. As may be recalled, the fuel consists
of laminae of uranium (0.004 in. thick) and Teflon
(0.142 in. thick); the measurements were made at
selected positions on lines perpendicular to these
laminae. The fission rate distribution across each
traverse is plotted in the lower part of Fig. 3.3 as
a function of the number of uranium sheets between

Operation at high temperature of a critical as-
“sembly mockup of the ART is scheduled for late
summer, 1955. In addition to a determination of
the critical uranium concentration at the elevated
"temperature, the purposes of the experiment are to
evaluate the temperature coefficient of reactivity,
to investigate the effectiveness of control rod
materials, and to measure the contribution of the
fuel in the upper end duct to the over-all reactivity.

The experiment will be performed at zero nuclear
power and at about 1200°F. Heat will be supplied
by electrical heaters external to the reflector. The
assembly is to include a beryllium island and a
beryllium reflector, essentially 12 in. thick, which
will be in a helium or argon atmosphere and will
contain no sodium.

The ART core configuration, as presently envi-
sioned, will be exactly mocked up in the experiment
between points 18 in. above and below the equatorial
plane of the core. Some minor deviations from the

8

 

ART design are being made beyond these points to
simplify filling and draining, The fuel will not be
circulated. The core will be filled with molten
fuel from a sump tank by using helium to force the
molten salt into the assembly, The system will be
tilled initially for cleaning and testing with a 50-50
mole % mixture of NaF and ZrF,. Increments of
Na, UF (with the uranium enriched with 93% U23%)
will subsequently be added to the NaF-ZrF , mix-
ture in the sump tank. After each addition of
Na, UF, the mixture will be pressurized into the
core and then drained until the critical uranium
concentration is determined.

A single rod will be located within a 1.50-in.-1D
Inconel thimble along the vertical axis of the
beryllium island, It will extend from the top of the
reactor tank to 10 in. below the equatorial plane of
the core. The control rod will be a cylindrical
annulus of the mixture of rare-earth elements
described above, enclosed in an Inconel shell.
Annuli of two widths, % and Y in., will be provided
for comparison.

The system is being designed to operate iso-
thermally at 1200°F normally, with provision made
for short periods of operation at temperatures up to
1300°F to enable reactivity temperature coefficient
measurements to be made. An attempt will also be
made to measure the fuel temperature coefficient
by inserting the fuel into the reactor assembly at
a temperature different from that of the beryllium.

"Phase equilibrium studies were made of the
systems LiF-ZrF,, NoF-LiF-ZrF,, and NaF-LiF-
ZrF UF ,. Two BeF,-bearing systems — NaF-
LiF-BeF, and NaF-LiF-BeF ,-UF , — were studied,
and the solubility of UF, in BeF ,-bearing systems
was investigated. A method for zone melting of
fused salts was devised as an aid in phase
equilibrium studies. Additional work was done
in investigating the equilibrium reduction of FeF
by hydrogen in NaZrF, the reduction of UF, by
structural metals, and ‘the stability of chromium
and iron fluorides in molten fluorides. Vapor
pressure measurements were made on UF, in the
temperature range 1270 to 1390°C.

The investigation of the variables affecting the
reduction with metallic uranium of UF, dissolved
in alkali fluorides was continued. A study of the
effect of the nickel filters used in experiments for
determining the stability of UF, in the NaF-KF-
LiF system showed that disproportionation of the
UF, occurred because of the filter.

Fuel purification and preparation research
included experimental use of electrolysis under a
hydrogen atmosphere to remove oxides and the
use of metallic zirconium to replace most of the
hydrogen in the stripping operation. In addition,
attempts were made to prepare mixtures containing
very high UF,/UF, ratios. A study of the con-
ditions for the preparation of BeF ,-bearing melts
was continued, and production operations were
resumed to provide test materi

PHASE EQUILIBRIUM STUDIES

H. Insley, Consultant

The very considerable interest in obtaining
fuel mixtures with physical properties more
favorable than those available in the NaF-ZrF ,-UF ,
system has led to evaluation of the NaF-LiF-ZrF,
ternary and the NaF-LiF-ZrF,-UF, quaternary
systems. Largely as a consequence of studies
pursued during the past quarter, the former system
has been reasonably well defined; the latter
requires considerably more effort, While phase
equilibrium data show that quite low melting
points are available in this system and that
adequate melting points are available at ZrF,
concentrations as low as 21 mole %, no compo-
sition with physical properties better than those
available in the NaF-ZrF ,-UF, system has been
demonstrated.

Study of the analogous NaF-LiF-BeF, system
has been continued. Adequate melting points are
available over wide areas in this system, Whether
the physical properties of proper compositions in
this system can show significant advantages over
those in the NaF-ZrF ,-UF , system cannot yet be
answered with certainty.

21 mole % ZrF, was confirmed by quenching
experiments on both sides of this composition.
The eutectic temperature found by quenching is
about 600°C instead of the 590°C indicated by
thermal analysis. The melting point of<Li 3ZrF,
(645°C according to thermal analysis) could not
be checked by quenching because of too rapid
crystallization, Decomposition of Li,ZrF_ into

Li 2ZrF and LiF occurs somewhere below 480°C,

This decomposition explains a series of cooling
breaks at about 465°C and the apparent discrepancy
between thermal analysis dota and the results of
solid-phase studies (reported earlier'). The
melting point of Li JIrF (585°C according to
recent thermal analysis data?) was found to be
“approximately 590°C by quenching. The primary
phase was found to be Li 2LrF , and thus the
“belief that this compound melts congruently was
confirmed.

The only other binary compound in the system,
as yet unidentified, was found by examination of
both quenched and slowly cooled samples con-
taining more than 50 mole % ZrF,. No evidence
was found for the existence of LiZrF,. A careful
study of samples of compositions with 57.1, 60,
62.5, and 66.7 mole % ZrF , which were held both
above and below the solidus temperature for about
12 hr before quenching indicates that the unidenti-
fied compound is probably Li oZrsF oy, (60%) or
Li 3Zr Fo (57.1%) and that it melts incongruently
to Zt, and liquid at about 515°C. The optical
properties of this compound are almost identical
to those of Li,ZrF ; so it was necessary to rely
almost entirely on x-ray diffraction to differentiate
between them. Work on questionable aspects of
the compositions with more than 50 mole % ZF,
is continuing.

The differential thermal analysis technique and
the equipment previously used in the study of the
NaF-Z¢F , system® were also employed to obtain
more precise thermal data for LiF-ZrF, mixtures.
Ten-gram samples were prepared by mixing purified
Li LZrF with the required amount of ZrF, or
Li “ZF in welded nickel capsules fitted With
thin-walled center thermocouple wells. Manual
control of a Variac transformer was found to give
a reasonably uniform rate of heating, about 90°C /hr,

and of cooling, about 75°C/hr. The base line
obtained on the automatic plot of sample temper-
ature vs differential temperature (difference
between sample and Al,O, reference amplified by
a d-c amplifier) seemed to be less erratic when
the transformer was controlled manually than when
the automatic temperature controller was used.
The compositions studied to date cover the range
from 31.9 to 66.7 mole % ZrF,. These studies are
incomplete, but the data ‘Obtained indicate a
melting point of 493 + 5°C for the eutectic at
about 50 mole % ZF, and a value of 520 + 5°C
for the incongruent melting point of the unidentified
compound containing more than 50 mole % ZrF ,.
The thermal effect at 462°C was apparent on the
heating curves of all compositions, presumably
because a small amount of LiF present in the
Li,ZrF , combined with Li 2ZtF¢ to give Li ZrF_.
This effect was noted only upon cooling of the
mixture with 31.9 mole % ZrF,, in which it would
be expected that Li 3ZrF, would be present. The
existence of only one thermal effect, at 565°C,
for this composition, in addition to the 462°C
solidus transition, appears to verify the existence
of the Li, ZrF-Li Zr F eutectic near this compo-
sition. These studies are continuing, and it is
expected that a revised diagram will be completed
for this system in the near future.

The Ternary System NaF-LiF-ZrF,

C. M. Blood H. A. Friedman
F. P. Boody F. W. Miles
R. E. Thoma

Fuel mixtures based on the NaF-ZrF, system
have suitable melting points only if the compo-
sition lies close to the compound Na 72 Fan
which is characterized on the phase diagram by a
flat maximum at 520°C with 500°C eutectics on
either side. The typical NaF-ZrF,.-UF, fuel
mixture therefore contains about 45 mole % ZrF,.
ft is unfortunate that several of the physical
properties values of this class of fuels are some-
what unsatisfactory because of the high ZrF,
content. The physical properties that are trouble-
some are vapor pressure, kinematic viscosity, and
heat capacity per unit volume. In the LiF- ZF,
system, the low-melting region occurs at 50%
ZrF, and 500°C, and therefore there is little

promise of improved physical properties here.

 

 
 

1000 W,

 

However, there was a possibility that low-melting
regions with much lower ZrF, content would be
found in the NaF-LiF-ZrF, ternary system. The
substitution of LiF for NaF was expected to
result in lower melting points, because Li ZrF,
(mp, 645°C) melts ot a much lower temperature
than does Na,ZrF_ (mp, 850°C), and Li, ZrF (mp,
585°C) melts pn a much lower temperatura than does
Na,ZrF  (incongurent, liquidus at 700°C). The use
of tir would be expected to result in higher heat
capacities. In order to find low-melting regions
that would have as little ZrF , and as much LiF as
possible, the ternary system NaF-LiF-ZrF, was

No ternary compounds were encountered.

The liquidus contours were obtained from
cooling curves on melts of at least 500 g con-
tained in 4-in. graphite liners which were enclosed
in nickel pots in a 5-in, pot furnace. The melts
were stirred by belt-driven nickel stirrers; temper-
atures were measured by thermocouples in the
hollow shafts of the stirrers, A flowing atmosphere
of helium was maintained over the melts. The
important features of the ternary system were
determined on mixtures blended from eutectic or
compound compositions which had been purified

by a high-temperature HF treatment. All the
solidified samples were examined petrographically
to determine the phases present, and representative
samples were examined by x-ray diffraction when-
ever questions arose which could be studied by
this technique.

The first objective of the investigation was to
find quasi binaries which would serve to define
the compatibility triangles in the ternary system.
Beginning at the low ZrF, concentrations, the
join between LiF and Na,ZrF_ was found to be a
quasi binary with a simple eutectic at 625°C and
38 mole % LiF. The compatibility triangle formed
with this join and NaF as an apex contains a
ternary eutectic at NaF-LiF-ZrF , (51-38-11 mole %)
which melts at 600°C and contains NaF, LiF, and
Na,ZrF..

The ext quasi binary is the Na 3ZrF Li ZrF,
join, Here extensive solid solutions occur, as
shown in Fig. 4.2. Cooling curves gave uncertain
indications of the solidus, and therefore the
limits of miscibility at the eutectic are not known.
However, the limit of miscibility of Na ZrF i
LijZrF, mixtures at 350°C is clearly defined.
This is due to the existence of a lower limit of
stability of Li, ZrF, at 490°C, coupled with the
lowering of the limit of stability by increasing
amounts of solid solution with Na,ZrF_ and the
large thermal effect associated with the decompo-
sition. At the composition NaF-LiF- ZrF , (26-49-
25 mole %) the lower limit of stability of the
LijZrF rich solid solution has decreased to
350°C, and the saturation limit has been reached.
The x-ray diffraction lines for the Na,ZrF_-rich
solid solutions are puzzling in that they show the
expected shifts up to about 30% LiF and unex-
pected, decreased shifts at higher LiF concen-
trations. The eutectic occurs at 50% and 590°C.

The compatibility triangle lying between the
Na,ZrF_-LiF join and the Na 3ZrF Li ZrF join
is Sharacterized by three two-phase erystallization
paths with a relatively small temperature gradient;
the paths join to form a eutectic at NaF-LiF- ZrF,
(22-55-23 mole %) that melts at 575°C,

Superficially, the join between Na ,ZrF and
Li ,ZrF . appears to be a quasi binary, Aince only
the 2 end members are readily identifiable in so-
lidified melts lying on this join, and a eutectic-
type break in the cooling curves is found at
445°C and 31% LiF. However, Na,ZtF, melts
incongruently at 630°C, and on the Na,ZrF limb

of the eutectic, Na,ZrF rich solid solutions are
the primary phase. The eutectic type of halt at
445°C is observable only on the Li,ZrF limb,
and it corresponds to the appearance Sof an
Na ZrF_-rich phase, which must subsequently
react with liquid to give the Na,ZrF found as a
final product, The true eutectic between Na,ZrF
and Li,ZrF, appears to occur at about 435°C.
The thermal effects accompanying this behavior
are shown in Fig. 4.3.

tablishment of meaningful compatibility triangles

The Ternary System NaF-LiF-BeF,. A con-

siderable amount of thermal data has been obtained
by means of cooling curves with mixtures in the
NaF-LiF-BeF, system containing 10 to 50 mole %
BeF,. The LiF-Li,BeF ,-Na,BeF ,-NaF section
of the system has been investigated most thoroughly
because it is expected that melts containing less
than 33 mole % BeF, will have low viscosity,
high heat capacity, and other favorable physical
properties. The thermal analysis investigation of
the system has been hampered by undercooling,
most troublesome with melts containing more than
33 mole % BeF,, and by difficulty in obtaining
reproducible data. The filtration technique was
used to determine liquidus temperatures with two
compositions. Mixtures prepared for thermal
analysis were studied by x-ray diffraction and
petrographic techniques. Although some progress
was made in understanding the phase relationships
in this system, which are complicated by the
existence of ternary components, they are far
from being completely elucidated. It appears that

equilibrium data are difficult to obtain in this
system. It is expected that the quenching and
differential thermal analysis techniques will be
applied to the study of this system in the near
future,

Thermal data for the LiF-Na,BeF, join are
shown in Fig. 4.4. Solid-phase studies of the
slowly cooled melts showed that only the two
components were present. The minimum-melting
mixture on the join has the composition NaF-LiF-
BeF, (56-16-28 mole %), and the melting point of
480 * 5°C is the lowest thus far observed with
BeF. mixtures containing significantly less than
33 mole % BeF,. Consequently, this mixture is
potentially important as a fuel carrier. The solid-
phase studies have also shown that mixtures
within the LiF-Na,BeF ,-NaF triangle contain
only these three components. Other compatibility
triangles that have been tentatively postulated on
the basis of incomplete, and sometimes conflicting,
data are LiF-Na,LiBe,F,-Li,BeF, and LiF-
Na,BeF ,-Na,LiBe,F,. The latter compound is

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1955

the only ternary compound that has been definitely
identified in the present studies, but other phases,
as yet unidentified, have been observed,

The cooling-curve data suggest the existence of
a ternary eutectic that melts at 325 + 10°C. The
composition of this low-melting eutectic is not
definitely known, but it may be near the compo-
sition NaF-LiF-BeF, (27-35-38 mole %). If
confirmed, this would be one of the lowest melting
fluoride mixtures known that has favorable nuclear
properties and, possibly, other good physical
properties.

The Quaternary System NaF-LiF-BeF,-UF,.
Only one composition in the NaF-LiF-BeF,-UF,
system was investigated. The addition of 2.5
mole % UF, to the LiF-Na,BeF, eutectic lowered
the apparent liquidus temperature, determined by
visual observation, to 465 + 5°C., The liquidus
temperature will be checked by filtration because
of the observation of poorly reproducible thermal
effects on cooling curves at 570 £ 15°C. The
uranium in this mixture was combined as Na,UF

Solubility of UF, in BeF,-Bearing Compositions.
The solubility of UF, in BeF ,-bearing compositions

BeF, mixtures, some of them at different temper-

atures. All the determinations were carried out

in nickel filtration apparatus; the melt was

filtered through nickel filters after an equilibration

BeF ,-containing melts and reported earlier were
obtained in the same type of equipment.? The

poor reproducibility of the data, shown in Table 4.2,
indicates that equilibrium was not attained in
these experiments, probably because of alloying
of the uranium with the nickel container and filter
with consequent lack of control of the activity of
the uranium,

The scattered data in Table 4,2 show a trend of
increasing UF, solubility with increasing temper-
ature and decreasing BeF, content, but in no
case does it appear that the solubility of UF,
at 600°C is sufficiently high to provide more than
a fraction of the concentration needed for an ART

for the solubility of UF, in NaF-BeF, mixtures
were based upon the assumption that all uranium
dissolved in the melt was in the trivalent form.
This assumption was erroneous, as the data in
Table 4.2 clearly demonstrate. The .data in
Table 4.2 are now supported by recent Mound
data. ®

The low concentration of uranium dissolved in
the NaF-BeF, (57-43 mole %) mixture at 600°C,
which is in line with results reported by Mound
Laboratory,® suggests that a large part of the
tetravalent uranium present in BeF, melts to
which UF, and uranium metal were added was due
to disproportionation rather than to oxidation by
impurities in the melt. The NaF-BeF, (77-23
mole % and 75-25 mole %) mixtures and also the
ternary mixture NaF-LiF-BeF, (56-16-28 mole %)
shown in Table 4.2 were not purified, and it is
quite possible that a part of the tetravalent
uranium present was due to oxidizing impurities.

Reaction of Uranium Metal with BeF,-Bearing
Compositions. Uranium metal was added to all
except one of the mixtures used for UF; solubility
determinations, but only a few experiments were
performed in which uranium metal was the only
form of uranium added. The analyses of material
filtered through nickel filters after equilibrating
20 g of a purified alkali fluoride—~BeF , mixture
with 4 g of uranium metal for 2 hr are shown in
Table 4.3. The data in Table 4.3 are insufficient
to determine whether the dissolved uranium was
due to oxidation of uranium metal by BeF, or by
oxidizing impurities in the melts, and further
experimentation is planned to Clarify this point,

Visual Observation of Fluoride Melts

R. J. Sheil

Materials Chemistry Division

A plastic, inert-atmosphere box similar to one
previously described” was used for observation of
a number of fluoride melts. Some of the results
of these observations are given below.

All the alkali fluoride—BeF, mixtures prepared
to date showed a scum when first melted, The
unpurified mixtures were worse than the purified
mixtures in this respect, as might be expected.
The small amount of scum that appeared on melts
of purified mixtures was dissolved when the melt
was heated to about 750 or 800°C, and, in some
instances, a water-clear melt was obtained. When
the mixtures contained UF,, the scum had a
reddish-brown color suggestive of UO,, but this
scum likewise dissolved when the melt was heated
to higher temperatures.

It was found that a melted mixture having the
nominal composition NaF-LiF-ZrF -UF, (20-55
21-4 mole %) was reddish-brown when only 15%
of the uranium was in the trivalent form, When
all the uranium was in the tetravalent form, melts
of this composition had the normal green coloration.

Alkali fluoride-BeF, melts appear to have a
rather high surface tension, and they do not wet a
clean nickel surface. These effects could possibly
be ascribed to small amounts of impurities in the
melts being concentrated in the liquid surface, but
this is not considered to be likely.

The zone-melting method consists in alternately
melting and freezing the salt mixture at very slow
rates to allow use of the principle of fractional
recrystallization on a multistage basis. Some

Equilibrium Reduction of FeF, by H, in NaZrF,

C. M. Blood

Materials Chemistry Division

Previous measurements® of the partial pressure
of HF at equilibrium during reduction of FeF,
by hydrogen showed higher values than would be
predicted from thermochemical data and ideal
solution behavior. These high values were tenta-
tively ascribed to a lowered activity of the
metallic iron because of alloying of this element
with the nickel apparatus. The postulated alloying
has been confirmed by low values for final FeF,
content of the melt and by chemical analyses of
portions of the nickel apparatus.

Attempts have been made to repeat these ex-
periments with a mild-steel liner in the nickel
apparatus, a steel gas entrance tube, and steel
screen baffles. Preliminary data have shown that
the presence of a stainless steel thermocouple
well extending into the melt has been causing a
steady increase in chromium content of the melt
with consequent loss of FeF, from the solution.
This unintended side reaction was taken into
account in the calculations and will be avoided in
the future,

The results again showed somewhat higher
HF values than those predicted. The apparent
equilibrium constant (mole fraction of dissolved

"species used as activity) was 5.7 for this ex-

periment; this is significantly lower than the
value of 8 obtained in the nickel equipment and is
much higher than the calculated value of 1.6 for
ideal behavior.

Reduction of UF, by Structural Metals

J. D. Redman C. F. Weaver
Materials Chemistry Division

The reduction of UF, by metallic chromium and
iron has been studied by methods previously
described in ANP quarterly progress reports, and
equilibrium data, obtained by using either NaF-ZrF
(50-50 mole %) or the NaF-KF-LiF eutectic
(11.5-42-46.5 mole %) as the reaction medium,
have been reported. More recently, the reduction
of UF, has been investigated with NaF-ZrF
(53-47 mole %) used as the solvent. Also, the
reaction of UF, with chromium metal and Inconel
has been studied by using mixtures of UF, and
UF, dissolved in NaF-KF-LiF.

The results of some studies on the reduction of
UF, by chromium metal in NaF-ZrF , (53-47 mole %)
at 600 and 800°C are given in Table 4.4, In
these experiments, 2 g of hydrogen-fired chromium
was reacted with UF, (11.4 wt %) in 40 g of the
NaF-ZrF, mixture contained in nickel. The
values given for K,_ were calculated for the
reaction

2UF + Cro 2UF, + CrF,

by using concentrations expressed in mole
fractions.

Previous studies with NaF-ZrF, (50-50 mole %)
as the solvent and 4.1 mole % UF, gave a chromium
concentration of 2250 ppm and K_ = 4 x 10-4 at
600°C, and 2550 ppm of chromium and K,_ = 5 x 10-4
at 800°C. Thus, an increase from 0.48 to 0.51
in the final mole fraction of NaF in the melt
containing uranium causes a significant decrease
in the equilibrium CrF, concentration.

Data for the reaction of UF, with metallic iron
inNaF-ZrF , (53-47 mole %) are given in Table 4.5.
In these runs, 2 g of hydrogen-fired iron wire and
11.4 wt % UF , were used.

The iron concentrations given in Table 4.5 are
very nearly equal to those found for this reaction
when NaF-ZrF, (50-50 mole %) was used as the
solvent. They also agree very closely with those
obtained when NaF-KF-LiF (11.5-42-46.5 mole %)
was used as the solvent. The iron values were
somewhat higher at 600 thar at 800°C in all three
systems studied.

Data are presented in Table 4.6 for the reaction
of chromium metal with 13.3 wt % UF, plus 1.5

Stability of Chromium and Iron Fluorides
in Molten Fluorides

J. D. Redman C. F. Weaver
Materials Chemistry Division

A number of experiments were run to determine,
if possible, the extent to which some of the
structural metal fluorides are reduced by metallic
iron or chromium. In one experiment, 10.9
wt % Fe3* was added as FeF ; to the NaF-KF-LiF
mixture contained in an iron charge bottle and
reacted at 800°C. The filtrate was found to
contain 14.7 wt % total Fe and 13.8 wt % Fe**,
Another run, at 600°C, gave 3.9 wt % Fe** and
4.4 wt % total Fe, which indicated that the Fe3*
was almost completely reduced by the metallic
iron, Some results obtained for several other
combinations are given in Table 4.8, The results
given in Table 4.8 show that NiF , is quantitatively
reduced by metallic chromium and iron at 600 and
800°C in the NaF-KF-LiF mixture and that FeF,

is reduced by chromium under similar conditions,

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1953

Since previous studies!® had indicated that
FeF, was relatively stable in the NaF-KF-LiF
eutectic at 600 and 800°C, some additional runs
were made for which a longer heating period was
used. The results of these runs are given in
Table 4.9. The data showed that some 90% or
more of the iron was divalent after 12 hr of
heating. This finding is in agreement with
findings of the earlier studies for which the
heating period was 3 to 5 hr.

The previous reports?:10 qglso presented data
which indicated that CrF, is not stable in the
NaF-KF-LiF eutectic but probably disproportionates
according to the reaction

The values given in Table 4.10 are, in general,
‘in agreement with the previous data. Most of the
Cr** changes valence state, but the total chromium
content found is too high to account for removal of
“Cr** by disproportionation, The similarity of
“total chromium in the filtrates and in the residues
“suggests that finely divided chromium passes the
filter, but, if the case were this simple, the values
. reported for Cr** should include this metal and
“therefore be higher than those found. No satis-
“factory explanation for the behavior of CrF, under
these conditions can be given at present.

resulting from the disproportionation of UF,
The low vapor pressure of the system limited the
measurements to temperatures above 1270°C, and
the failure of the container material (type 316
stainless steel) was the limiting factor at temper-
atures near 1400°C.

In all cases, UF, of at least 95% purity was
used as the starting material. Analysis of the
condensate of the vapor phase, collected from the
tubes of the vapor pressure cell, showed that the
vapor phase was pure UF,. The disproportionation

The heat of vaporization of pure UF, as obtained
from the slope of the line, is 38,600 cal/mole.
This value is in fair agreement with the value
of 42,000 cal/mole obtained by R. E. Moore.

It was not surprising to find that the vapor
pressure from UF, was only a small fraction of
that from pure UF, but it had not been anticipated
that the fraction would rapidly become increasingly
smaller with increasing temperatures. Indeed, at
sufficiently elevated temperatures, this would not
be the case. The effect of dissolved UF, is
undoubtedly important; it appears that the solu-
bility of UF, increases markedly with temper-
“ature and also that the UF, is complexed to the
‘extent that pronounced negative deviations from
Raoult’s law are observed. There was no definite
“evidence of alloying of uranium metal with the
tantalum liner; no x-ray diffraction data on uranium-
tantalum alloys are available.

An extrapolation of the vapor pressure curves
in Fig. 4.5 to the point of intersection might be
expected to provide a rough estimate of the
eutectic temperature of the UF .UF, system.
The intersection occurs at about 1010°C, whereas
cooling curves have shown thermal arrests, which
were presumed to correspond to the UF,-UF,
eutectic, at 870°C. This discrepancy is probably
due not only to the difficulty of obtaining the
vapor pressure measurements but also to the long
range through which the extrapolation must be
made and the change in AH with temperature
through this range.

The small slope found for the disproportionation
pressure curve means that the disproportionation
of UF, is far from complete under the conditions
prevailing in the vapor pressure cell and that UF,
is thermodynamically stable with respect to pure
UF, and uranium metal at temperatures below

1400°C.

Reduction of UF, with Uranium in

Alkali Fluorides

C. J. Barton B. H. Clampitt
Materials Chemistry Division

The investigation of the variables affecting the
reduction with metallic uranium of UF, dissolved
in alkali fluorides was continued during the past
quarter. The technique used in these experiments,
which are carried out in a small, nickel, filtration
apparatus, was described previously.17 It has
become apparent that alloying of nickel and uranium
can occur at temperatures far below the minimum
nickel-uranium liquidus temperature (732°C) and,
consequently, that disproportionation of UF; can
be expected to occur at the temperatures of
interest at nickel surfaces or at any metallic
surface with which uranium can alloy. Some effort
was therefore devoted to finding container ma-
terials that will alloy less readily with uranium.
Copper, which has a minimum liquidus temperature
of 950°C with uranium, showed some promise in
this regard. Although the results obtained in
nickel apparatus, and possibly also those obtained
in copper containers, are not to be regarded as
equilibrium data, these experiments did give some
indication of the effect of some of the variables
that are involved in the reaction and thus are of
value. In some experiments, pure UF; was
introduced directly for comparison with results
obtained in reduction experiments. The results
are reported below under the headings of the
variables investigated.

Effect of Nickel Surface Area, It was previously
reported that the amount of nickel surface area
exposed to alkali fluoride-UF, melts had a
marked effect on the degree of reduction ob-
tained.'? This observation is substantiated by

the data shown in Table 4.12.

In these experiments, the normal surface-to-
volume ratio of 2.55 (square centimeters of
surface exposed to melt divided by volume of
melt in cubic centimeters) was decreased by
using a larger charge (40 g) and increased by
adding Y-in. nickel balls or nickel powder. The
nickel filter medium surface area, to which the
melts were exposed for a short time, was neglected
in making these calculations, but it was the same
in all experiments. The nickel surfaces were
exposed to hydrogen at 750°C before the charge
materials were added, and partial sintering of the
nickel powder undoubtedly reduced the surface
area to a smaller value than that calculated. The
marked effect of nickel surface area upon the
degree of reduction of uranium, as shown by the
data in Table 4.12, was probably due to the
previously mentioned effect of alloying of uranium
with the nickel.

Effect of Copper Surface Area, In view of the
results obtained with nickel, it seemed desirable
to determine the effect of another metal on the
reduction of UF, with uranium. Finely divided
copper powder that was hydrogen-fired at 750°C
was added to an LiF-NaF-UF ,-U° mixture (57.6-
38.4-4.0 mole % + 20 wt % excess U°) in sufficient
amount to give a surface-to-volume ratio of about
1000 if the surface area of the nickel container

was neglected. The filtrate obtained after the
mixture was heated for 2 hr at 750°C contained
19.2 wt % U3* and 26.0 wt % total uranium. These
results compared favorably with those obtained in
the absence of the copper and encouraged an
investigation of copper as a container material
for UF ;-containing melts.

Effect of Excess Uranium. It was reported
earlier'? that there was little difference in the
degree of reduction of NaF-KF-LiF-UF, with
uranium metal whether the theoretical amount of
uranium required by the equation

RU + BUF, ==UF,

was used or whether 1.2 times the theoretical
amount was employed. It therefore seemed
desirable to investigate this variable with NaF-LiF
(40-60 mole %) as the solvent instead of NaF-KF-
LiF. This investigation was carried out in nickel
apparatus, including nickel filters, and in copper
apparatus equipped with a bronze filter medium.

The results are given in Tables 4.13 and 4.14.
The theoretical total uranium in the filtrate in all
these experiments, assuming complete reaction of
the UF, with the uranium metal according to the
above equation, was 27.1 wt %.

The data in Tables 4.13 and 4.14 are somewhat
erratic, but it appears that little is to be gained
by using more than 100% excess uranium (two
times the theoretical amount) under the conditions
of these experiments, Comparison of the results
in the two tables indicates that UF, dissolved
in NaF-LiF is more stable in copper than in
nickel.

Stability of Binary Alkali Fluoride=UF ; Mixtures.
The preparation of filtered LiF-UF, samples
containing 91 to 96% of the uranium in the trivalent
form was reported earlier, 18 but no data on filtered
NaF-UF, samples have been reported. Therefore
a few experiments were performed to determine the

stability of UF, in these systems under the same
conditions as those used for more complex systems
except that higher temperatures were necessitated
by the higher liquidus temperatures. The data
are given in Table 4.15. Since the data do not
show any significant differences between the two
systems in degree of reduction and since UF, is
known to form a stable complex with NaF in the
solid state but not with LiF, it appears that
complex formation has little influence on the
stability of fused alRali—~UF, mixtures.

Effect of Filter Medium on Stability of UF,
M. B. Panish

Materials Chemistry Division

Previous studies!? on the stability of UF, in
the NaE-KF-LiF eutectic suggested that the
sintered nickel filters used for the filtrations
probably had an effect on the degree of reduction
found in the filtrates, Since it appeared likely

that the UF, concentration found in the filtrate

did not correspond to that present during the
equilibration because the UF, was reduced by
rapid removal of uranium from the melt through
alloying with the nickel filter during filtration,
some experiments were performed to confirm or
disprove this possibility. These experiments
included runs in which a sintered nickel filter was
used and others in which a perforated nickel
stick was used in place of the filter. The use
of container materials other than nickel has been
investigated, as well as filtration through graphite.

The runs were made by using NaF-KF-LiF
(11.5-42-46.5 mole %) as the solvent and 7 to 14%
uranium present as fluoride. The uranium metal

added was 500 to 1000% in excess of that required

to reduce all the uranium fluoride to UF, if it
were assumed that all the uranium was present as
UF,. This large excess was used to ensure that
some uranium metal was present at unit activity
even though a large amount of the uranium present
probably alloyed with the walls of the nickel
container. Data were obtained only from the runs
in which unchanged uranium metal was visible in
the heel.

The reaction-filtration apparatus was modified
to permit rapid interchange of containers of differ-
ent types and materials. Sintered nickel of 0.0015-
in. pore size was used as the filter in all cases
except where otherwise indicated. A nickel stick
with four %qmine holes hear the bottom was used
to draw up portions of the melts that were not
filtered. The results given in Table 4.16 were
obtained by using an equilibration period of 2 to
4 hr, except as otherwise indicated.

If it is assumed that there is very little or no
uranium metal present in the samples obtained
in the perforated nickel stick, it may be deduced
from the results in Table 4.16 that the dispro-
portionation of the UF. occurs, at least in a
major part, because of depletion of the uranium
from the melt by the sintered nickel filter. It
should be noted that the total uranium found was
lower by 1 to 1.5 wt % (absolute) in those cases
in which the sintered nickel filters were used,
whereas the total uranium was, in general, the
same (within experimental error) as that expected
in the cases in which the perforated nickel sticks
were used. This loss of 1 to 1.5% of the uranium

accounts for the difference in the degree of

reduction observed in the melts. Analyses of.

.several sintered nickel filters gave results which
showed that there was more uranium in the filters

than would be expected if they were simply

Several runs were made with the NaF-KF-LiF

obtaining samples. The ratio of U3* to total
uranium found at 650°C varied from 0.42 to 0.67,
and evidence of alloying of uranium with gold and
platinum was observed.

Three runs in which the NaF-KF-LiF mixture,
UF ,, excess uranium metal, and a graphite filter
were used were made in the temperature range
600 to 800°C. The degree of reduction varied
from 0.41 to 0.63, and indicated that graphite is
not a suitable medium for filtering melts con-
taining U3*, Analyses of the graphite filters gave
uranium values that accounted for 3% of the missing
uranium at 600°C and 75% at 800°C. Approximately
four times as much potassium was found in the
filters as existed in the NaF-KF-LiF mixture, and
thus it is thought that the potassium may have
reacted with the graphite under these conditions
to give a carbide.

Stability of PbF,-BeF, Melts in Inconel
C. J. Barton R. J. Sheil

Materials Chemistry Division

The desirability of determining the stability of
PbF ,-BeF, melts in Inconel was pointed out in
the arevious progress report.29 To determine the
stability, mixtures containing 50 and 75 mole %
BeF. were sealed in Inconel capsules and heated
for about 10 hr at 800°C in a helium atmosphere.
When the capsules were opened and the contents
melted out in a helium atmosphere, bright globules,
presumed to be metallic lead, were observed on
the capsule walls. It was concluded that Pb**
ions are not complexed in these mixtures strongly
enough to prevent reaction with Inconel at 800°C,

~and no further testing was performed with mixtures
in this system.

salts, The systems being investigated consist
of two phases that are thoroughly mixed to ensure
intimate contact. The metals to be studied (Cr,
Ni, Fe) can be alloyed with uranium to form
eutectics with melting points below 900°C, and
therefore at experimental temperatures over 900°C
the alloy may be used as one phase of a two-phase
system. The salt phase of the system must
consist of material not reduced by uranium metal,
and, consequently, for the initial experiments,
the salt phase is limited to alkali-metal halides
or combinations of alkali-metal halides.

It was expected from engineering data obtained
from thermal-convection loops that the uranium
alloys could be formed by heating the metals and
the salts in a graphite container under an inert
atmosphere or under vacuum. Consequently, an
apparatus was constructed with readily available
material to carry out the primary part of the experi-
ment. Contrary to expectations, when the experi-
ment was carried out under vacuum with chromium
as the added metal, there was catastrophic
decomposition of the graphite container and
distillation of alkali metals through the vacuum
system to the glass-wool trap. A more thorough
search for information concerning the reactions of
graphite and alkali metals then indicated that
potassium reacts with graphite and causes
decomposition of the crystal structure. The salt
used, NaF-KF-LiF, became green and seeped
through the graphite crucible. There was no
evidence of alloy formation between the uranium
and the chromium. The metal fragments present
had retained their initial shape and size, even
though the reaction vessel was heated to 1000°C.

In subsequent experiments, a helium atmosphere
was also found to be unsatisfactory for this
reaction. Additional attempts to make a uranium-
chromium alloy ‘in graphite liners in a nickel pot,
under helium or vacuum (50 to 75 pu) at a temper-
ature of 1150°C, have proved unsuccessful. Con-
sequently, it is now planned to use molybdenum

‘and/or tantalum crucible liners in a much smaller

stainless steel reactor. It is hoped, based on

“previous work with molybdenum, that these liners

will be inert to the reactants, The smaller volumes
and mass will make it possible to heat the
apparatus to temperatures of over 1200°C in
available equipment,

“Investigations of methods for rapid purification
of fuel mixtures have included attempts to use
electrolysis under a hydrogen atmosphere to
remove oxides in order to avoid the container
corrosion that results when HF is used and to use
metallic zirconium to replace most of the hydrogen
in the stripping operation. In addition, attempts
have been made to prepare mixtures containing
very high UF o/UF, ratios.

Use of Zirconium Metal in Fuel Purification.
The time-consuming step in fuel purification
processes is the reduction of such materials as
FeF, and NiF, with hydrogen. Reduction of these
materials by the addition of an active metal should
afford a more rapid process, but it is not possible
to add an excess of active metal to a UF ,-bearing
mixture without the formation of large and variable
quantities of UF,. A process has been demon-
strated on a 5- and 50-1b test scale, however, that
is quite rapid and effective if small UF; concen-
trations are tolerable or desirable.

To prepare NaF-ZrF ,-UF,, the NaF and ZF,
in proper quantity, are charged to the standard
apparatus and are hydrofluorinated in the usual
manner. At this stage, a considerable excess of
metallic zirconium chips in a nickel basket is
introduced into the reaction vessel. After 3 hr
of stirring with hydrogen, the basket and excess
zirconium metal are removed. The proper quantity
of UF, is then added to the melt, and another
nickel basket containing a small, known quantity
of zirconium metal is introduced. Stirring for 2 hr
suffices for the melt to react with all the zirconium
introduced.

In a 50-Ib test preparation of NaF- ZrF -UF
(50-46-4 mole %), the final mixture contained 15%
of the uranium as UF,, with the Fe, Cr, and Ni
contents being 50, 35, and 25 ppm, respectively.
it appears that utilization of some variant of this
procedure might cut the processing time on the
250-Ib production unit to below the 24 hr required,
at present, for each batch.

72

Electrolytic Purification of Fluoride Mixtures.
Experiments for determining the rate of oxide
removal by hydrofluorination were made during the
prepdration of some LiF-ZeF, mixtures, It was
found that hydrofluorination of a mixture for 1 hr
at 700°C would not lower the oxide concentration
below the limit of petrographic detection; similar
treatment at 800°C for 2 hr, however, was suf.
ficient. Since the dissolution of NiF, by the melt
and the length of the subsequent stripping time
are directly dependent on the hydrofluorination

time and the temperature, attempts were made to

remove oxides completely by electrolysis between
graphite anodes and nickel cathodes under a
hydrogen atmosphere. Previous experiments?!
had shown that oxides could be removed by
electrolysis and that the anode products were
CO and CO, when a graphite anode was used.
When hydrogen was used in conjunction with
electrolysis in recent experiments, the predominant
anode product was HF. The purpose of the experi-
ment was to test the combined effect of oxide
removal as a primary anode product and hydro-
fluorination by the electrolytically produced HF.

After 0.4 equivalent of HF had been produced by
electrolysis at a current efficiency of 37%, the
HF was stripped from the melt with hydrogen.
No oxide was detected by petrographic examination
of the transferred product, Chemical analyses
showed 1.1 wt % oxide in the sample before
electrolysis as compared with 0.4 wt % in the
finished product. The structural metal contami-
nation was simultaneously reduced to the following
values: Fe, 55 ppm; Cr, 15 ppm; Ni, 30 ppm.

The earlier experiments with electrolysis?}
had been carried out either in the NaF-KF-LiF

eutectic or in mixtures containing NaF and 40 to

50% ZrF,. The alkali fluoride eutectic was very

prone to an anode effect, while the ZrF ,-bearing
mixtures could be electrolyzed smoothly. Batches
of NaF-LiF eutectic proved to be variable in this
respect, and, in one case that gave a bad anode
effect, the addition of 0.1 mole % ZrF, gave no
significant improvement, On the other hand, an
NaF-ZrF, (81-19 mole %) batch could be electro-
lyzed smoothly; the transition range must lie
below 19 mole % ZrF ,.

uranium at 600°C, it was found that compositions
containing more than 50 mole % ZrF, would be
necessary. There was a possibility that UF,
was capable of furnishing fluoride ions to complex
the ZrF, so that the physical properties, particu-
larly vapor pressure, might be far different from
those of fuels in current use. Accordingly, a trial
was made with a composition that could be con-
sidered, from a stoichiometric point of view, to be
composed of NaZrF, and U(ZrF;),. The compo-
sition was NaF-ZrF ,-UF, (44-53-3 mole %). After
a thorough purification of the NaF-ZrF base, the
UF; was added, along with uranium metal (1 wt %
of the amount of UF) and zirconium metal (0.2 wt %
of the amount of ZrF,), and equilibrated under
hydrogen for 2 hr at 700°C. The uranium and
zirconium were included in an effort to suppress
the formation of UF,. After cooling to 600°C,
the 4-kg melt was filtered; 75% of the uranium had
remained as U3*, There was no insoluble heel.

The preparation was then repeated on a 50-Ib
batch; only 65% of the uranium was U3* This
was thought to be a consequence of the previous
history of the preparation vessels for the two
batches. The walls of the 4-kg reaction vessel
had been subjected to melts which deposited
uranium in the form of a nickel alloy, while no
preparations involving UF, had ever been made in
the 50-1b apparatus.

Another trial was made in the small apparatus

that a large excess of zirconium in the form of

Pilot-Scale Purification Operations

Fifty-six preparations totaling 630 Ib of material
were produced during the quarter. These prepa-
rations were of various compositions and were
consigned to various requesters for small-scale
corrosion studies, for physical property de-
terminations, or, in many cases, for use as purified
intermediates for phase-equilibrium investigations.

Uranium trifluoride was ao component of nearly
25% of the materials prepared. These batches
were prepared, in every case, by complete purifi-
cation of the solvent fluorides with the desired
quantity of UF, followed by addition and disso-
lution of the desired quantity of pure UF.

The study of optimum conditions for the prepa-
ration of BeF,-bearing melts was continued
without complete success being attained. Hydrogen
reduction of the nickel and iron compounds to
acceptable concentration levels appears to be
more difficult in the BeF,-bearing melts than in
the ZrF ,-bearing mixtures. When the HF concen-

provide test material for the greatly accelerated
ANP engineering program. A total of 4800 Ib of
purified material was prepared during the quarter,
Several small, but significant, changes in
operating techniques have contributed to better
operation, shorter processing times, and, conse-
quently, higher yields of material per man hour.
The three most important changes were the
institution of rigid specifications on the purity of
the raw materials, the use of a 30% larger flow
rate of hydrogen during the final stripping cycle,
and the use of parallel rather than series flow of
the hydrogen through the receiver and reaction
vessel, It appears that these changes have
reduced the processing time by nearly 50%. With
new or recently cleaned equipment, 250-1b batches
can be processed to meet specifications in 24 hr.
It has definitely been established that, by using
two men per shift, 1000 Ib can be produced per
five-day week; it is believed that this production
figure can be improved slightly in the near future.
Present estimates of ORNL and Pratt & Whitney
‘requirements during the next several months call
for production of 1500 Ib per week. It is believed
that two men per shift on a six-day work week
could meet this production level. Such an ex-
pansion of effort will necessitate an increase in

74

processing and storage containers, and, since
little excess capacity will be available for
emergencies, an increase in spare furnaces and
other maintenance items will be required to mini-
mize downtime for repair,

The life of the processing equipment has
already considerably exceeded expectations. A
number of the reactors have prepared more than
25 charges, and only one reactor has ever failed.
Tests are now under way to determine how many
runs can be made with the ‘‘specification’ raw
materials before excessive stripping times require
cleaning of the reactor,

In spite of the shorter processing times described
above, product purity is being rigorously main-
tained. Analyses of ten typical 250-lIb batches
of NaF-ZrF ,-UF , mixtures are shown in Table 4.18.

The present supply of ZrF, is not adequate to

meet the accelerated demand for the molten salts.

Commercially available (NaF) ZrF,, containing
about 30 mole % ZrF ,, is being used at present,
but, since this must be blended with 40% ZrF, to
produce ART fuel compositions, nearly 600 ib
of ZrF, is still required per week for the 1500-1 b-
per-week demand. Also, in making the hafnium-

ment, the use of the commercial (NaF) ZrF, will
not be permissible.

Since 250 Ib per week appears to be the limit of
the present capacity of the Y-12 Plant for the
production of ZrF,, alternative sources are being
urgently sought. A commercial source which
claims to be able to supply the required quantity
has been located, and specification tests of their
material are in progress. It appears, at present,
that this material may solve the problem; if so,
the Y-12 ZrF -production facility will be used
only part time as needed to provide hafnium-free
material.

If the commercial source does not materialize,
it will be necessary to expand the Y-12 ZrF -

Batching and Dispensing Operation

J. P. Blakely F. A. Doss
Materials Chemistry Division

Since production of the purified fluorides is
done in 250-Ib batches and since a large fraction
of the tests call for smaller quantities, it is
necessary to batch a considerable fraction of the
material produced into 5-, 10-, or 50-1b containers.
In the recently accelerated program it has been
necessary to operate this equipment virtually
full time on a one-shift, five-day-week basis,
During the quarter a total of 6680 lb of material
was batched and dispensed by this unit.

During recent weeks, equipment has been
installed to permit hydrogen firing of all 50-1b
transfer cans before re-use. Another unit capable
of handling the smaller containers is to be
installed in the near future, This equipment
should minimize contamination of clean fuel by
poorly handled and corroded containers.

For the first time since production began in
March 1954, usage during a quarter has kept pace
with production. Present estimates of anticipated
needs indicate that the demand for processed
materials will necessitate a six-day production
week after July of this year. The balance sheet
for the quarter is shown below:

“Enriched Fuels for In-Pile Loops. Two batches
of fuel containing enriched uranium were processed
~ for use in an in-pile loop. Since the size and
nature of the in-pile loop equipment require that
the finished fuel batch contain 600 + 50 g, it has
been agreed that in the future the material will be
prepared in larger portions and batched into
containers of proper size. An adequate ‘mechanism
for analytical quality and accountability control
has been established to ensure proper handling
and dispensing of the finished material.

As a consequence of increased demands for
fuels containing enriched uranium, the processing
facility has been established in a permanent and
properly equipped location. A new, smaller unit
that is better adapted to meet the demands of the
in-pile loops is being installed, and the larger
unit is being remodeled to accommodate require-
ments for the ART high-temperature critical
experiment. Present known demands for material
will require operation of the facility for one week
per month during the balance of the calendar year.

ART High-Temperature Critical Experiment.
Preparations are being made for the production of
the necessary materials for the high-temperature
critical experiment, for loading the experimental
equipment with the NaF-ZrF, (fuel carrier) and

most of the Na,UF, (fuel concentrate), and for
obtaining reliable samples of the mixture as the
experiment proceeds.

Production of the fuel carrier is presently under
way, and production of the fuel concentrate will
proceed when the UF , allocation is received, The
processing time for this material should not exceed
two weeks, but a somewhat longer time will be
required to obtain analyses and to comply with
accountability procedures.

‘Fabrication and overhauling of equipment to be

LE used are in progress. It is anticipated that all

© ‘preparations can be completed by July 1 of this

76

year. Since all operations will be similar to those
performed in the ARE startup, there would seem
to be no doubt of the validity of the procedures
to be used.

Reprocessing Pilot Plant. Plans are under way
to provide charge material and to fill the equipment
required to test operation of the uranium recovery
process developed by personnel of the Chemical
Technology Division (cf. Sec. 10). Operations
that each require about 800 Ib of material are
scheduled for July and December of this year.
The material, equipment, and procedure seem to
present no unfamiliar problems.

Experimental Preparation of Simple Fluorides

Vatiables Affecting UF, Preparation. The
preparation of UF, by heating a stoichiometric
mixture of UF, and finely divided uranium metal
in a sealed ball mill of stainless steel was
described in previous reports.23:24 The require-
ments for UF ;-bearing fuels appear to be most
easily met by the addition of this compound to
carefully purified solvent compositions, A study
of variables in UF; preparation has been made,
accordingly, to determine the optimum conditions
for production of kilogram quantities of the material,

The variables studied have included number and
size of the steel balls used as milling mediums,
amount of material charged, and the reaction time
and temperature, In order to facilitate loading and
unloading of the 4-kg 15-in. reaction vessel, the
loading tube diameter was increased to 1 in., and
one end plate was welded at 45 deg rather than at
90 deg to the cylinder axis.

In twenty preparations for which various reaction
conditions were used, essentially pure UF, was
obtained when the normal reaction time-temperature
program was used. This consisted of heating the
rotating mill and contents at 900°C for three
16-hr periods. The mill was cooled to room temper-
ature between heats and pounded with a hammer to
remove caked material from the walls.

Over the range studied (0.75 to 2.25 kg), charge
size does not appear to affect completeness of
conversion. Quantity and size of the milling

medium appeared to have no measurable ef-
fect on the purity of the resulting UF,. All
tests in which 1-in. balls and the standard
heating program were used were successful,
However, when Yimin. balls were used, the
product, in every case, appeared to be sintered.
This effect is serious because the fine powder is,
in general, desired and because the sintered
material adheres tenaciously to the mill and the
balls, Additional runs with other ball sizes have
been made, and the results will be reported when
available,

Some 30 kg of satisfactory UF, was prepared
during the quarter. Should the need arise, the
present equipment could produce 15 to 20 lb of
this material per week.

Potential measurements were made during the
past quarter with combinations of several half
cells consisting of metal electrodes bathed in
solutions of the corresponding metal ion in the
molten salts, The temperature range studied was,
in general, 550 to 700°C, with the system main-
tained under an inert atmosphere. The half cells
were contained in crucibles of Morganite, nickel,
or platinum; electrical contact between them was
achieved by a*‘salt bridge’ consisting of a porous
ZrO, rod impregnated with the molten salt solvent.

heating under helium at 500 to 600°C. The lower
temperature yields a material containing small
amounts of nitrogen, whereas heating at 600°C
gives a product that is contaminated by divalent
chromium, apparently because of interaction with
the nickel container. Chromic fluoride was also
prepared by hydrofluorination of anhydrous CrCl.
At 400°C the conversion is incomplete but ma-

The vapor pressure of ZrF, over NaF-ZrF,

precision. If the ratios of vapor pressures for

assumed to represent the activity ratios of ZrF,
and if ¢ is assumed to be unity, the activity ratios

tained directly from the emf equation. The results

was started during the past quarter because the
NaF-LiF-ZrF system is being considered as a
possible fuel carrier. The vapor pressure work
on mixtures containing 33.3 mole % ZrF, (Li, ZrF )
and 50 mole % ZrF, was completed. The data
for these two mixtures are given in Table 4.22.
The vapor pressure equations, which were ob-
tained from the best straight lines on a log
pressure vs reciprocal temperature plot, are, for

the 33.3 mole % ZrF, mixture,

log P {mm Hg) = —(8333/T) + 7.967 ,
and, for the 50 mole % ZF, mixture,

log P (mm Hg) = —(8848/T) + 9.397 ,

where T is in °K, The heats of vaporization are
38 kcal/mole for the 33.3 mole % ZrF, mixture
and 41 kcal/mole for the 50 mole % ZF, mixture.
The vapor pressures of the LiF- ZF, mixtures
are considerably higher than those of the corre-
sponding NaF-ZrF, mixtures. For example, the
vapor pressures of the 50% LiF mixture are 50
to 100% higher than those of the 50% NaF mixture.
It might have been expected that the small lithium
ion would produce compounds in the fused state
which were more stable than the sodium com-
pounds. One possible explanation for the higher
vapor pressures is that LiF, ~ ions may exist in
the melt. If the lithium ion has a marked tendency

Solubility of Xenon in Fused Salts

R. F. Newton
Research Director's Department

The previously described procedures?® for de-
termining the solubility of xenon in fused salts
were modified so that the source of the spread of
values obtained could be ascertained. long ex-
posure without stirring gave essentially the same
results and thus indicated that the supposition of
the production of fine gas bubbles by stirring,
which bubbles were then transferred to the stripper
along with the liquid, was unfounded. However,
long continued cycling of helium through the melt,
without recent exposure to xenon, gave material
which was caught in the liquid nitrogen trap and
was read on the McLeod gage as xenon. This
material may have been SiF, from the reaction of
the glass with the HF liberated from the NaF-
KF-LiF (11.5-42-46.5 mole %). Means for elimi-
"nating this material or correcting for it are now
under study.

High-Temperature X-Ray Spectrometer Studies

G. D. White
Metallurgy Division

T. N. McVay, Consultant

A high-temperature attachment for an x-ray
spectrometer is being used to help clarify some

“of the phase relationships in fuel systems of

interest. The apparatus consists of a water-
cooled aluminum cylinder with a vacuum-tight lid
which fits the open end of the cylinder and «
projecting rod on the closed end by which the
attachment is fitted into the goniometer. The
sample holder, tantalum heating element, reflector,
and thermocouple leads are all mounted on the
lid, which also contains an aperture for pumping
a vacuum. Inserted around the center of the
cylinder is a beryllium window through which the
x rays pass. When assembled, the attachment can
be pumped down to a vacuum of less than 1 pu by
using a Welch pump and a small diffusion pump,

Initially, the attachment was aligned by using
a ThO, sample. The bracket which holds the
sample can be rotated and can be shifted
vertically or horizontally. It is held in position
by three radial set screws. By manipulating these
set screws, the Tho, sample was put in a position
where one of its stronger x-ray peaks was at the
proper angle ond had maximum intensity. Thus
far the alignment has remained true, although
samples have been x-rayed almost daily for the
past three months.

In order for the attachment to be used most

“effectively, the sample to be studied must give
an” x-ray “diffraction pattern with fairly intense
“peaks, the diffraction patterns of the polymorphs

it be considerably different, and the inversions

“of ‘phase changes must be fairly rapid, especially

urface where sample holder "if the sample being studied oxidizes readily,

The sample to be x-rayed is ground to a powder

“and loaded into a nickel sample holder with space

“in the o fo ork Monochromatic x radiation, es- “left for “expansion, "After the sample holder has

been mounted in the bracket and the ‘thermocouple
bead has been placed on the surface of the

“powder, the lid is fastened to the cylinder, The

system is pumped down overnight, and the x-ray
diffraction patterns are obtained the next day.

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

Room-temperature patterns are always obtained
before and after heating to check on the alignment
and flatness of the surface of the sample.

To date, work has been done on compositions
in the systems: NaF-ZrF , LiF-ZrF and NaF-
BeF,, Only the study of the composition
2NaF.BeF, is discussed here. Two samples of
Na,BeF, were found to be different optically.
One of the samples contained twinned monoclinic
crystals, whereas the parallel extinction of
crystals in the other indicated an orthorhombic
structure. Room-temperature x-ray diffraction
patterns of the samples were very similar, the
only difference being in the intensities of the
peaks.

High-temperature x-ray diffraction patterns were
also obtained on ‘the samples. When heated, both
samples showed inversions at 236 and 336°C,

"and when cooled, showed inversions at 310 and

below 185°C, The temperature could not be
maintained below 185°C, and therefore the lower
inversion temperature could not be obtained.

The intensity and d values at room temperature,

300, and 340°C are

These data suggest that the samples are
actually a mixture of two phases: a room-temper-
ature phase and the 300°C form. There are
several d values at room temperature which are
present at 300°C if allowance is made for ex-
pansion of d values as the temperature is
increased. Therefore, the difference in intensity
values of the two samples at room temperature
could be due to a difference in ratios of the two
phases in the samples.

Materials Chemistry Division

Several Inconel forced-circulation loops that were
‘operated with fluoride mixtures and with sodium
as the circulated fluids were examined. Results
of corrosion and mass transfer under dynamic
conditions were obtained. Data were obtained on
an atkali-metal base fluoride mixture containing
UF, and on ZrF ,-base mixtures with UF, and with
combinations of UF, and UF; circulated at low
(1,000) and high (15,000) Reynolds numbers at a
maximum fluoride mixture temperature of 1500°F.

Further thermal-convection loop studies were
made of alkali-metal base fluoride mixtures with
UF, and UF, and ZrF j-base mixtures with UF,
and UF | in Inconel. The effects of temperature on
mass transfer and of the size and shape of the loop
on corrosion were investigated, and an evaluation
of the erratic results recently obtained with control
loops was made. Several brazing alloys on type
310 stainless steel and *'A’ nickel were tested
in sodium and in a ZrF,-base fuel mixture in an
attempt to find a brazing alloy that has good cor-
rosion resistance to both mediums. Cermets that
do not form solid-phase bonds were screened for
suitability for use in valves, bearings, and seals
exposed to liquid metals and fused fluorides.

Mass transfer of sodium in an Inconel thermal-
convection loop ‘and of lithium in a type 347 stain-
less steel loop was studied, as well as the cleaning
of beryllium-Inconel systems with Versene.

In the fundamental corrosion research, further

~ work was done on the investigation of film for-
“mation on metals, including tests of oxidation

‘theories, and additional experiments were conducted

in the investigation “of corrosion and mass ‘transfer
“of metals by fused sodium hydroxide.

FORCED-CIRCULATION STUDIES

G. M. Adamson R. S. Crouse
Metallurgy Division

Fluoride Mixtures in Inconel

Several forced-circulation loops that were oper-
ated by the Experimental Engineering Department
at the request of the Metallurgy Division were
disassembled and examined. The conditions of
operation of these Inconel loops in which fluoride
mixtures were circulated are summarized in

Table 5.1.

Two of the loops examined (4695-1 and -2) had
circulated NaF-ZrF ,-(UF + UF,) (50-46-4 mole %)
in which about 2 wt % of the uranium had been
converted to U3*. The design of loop 4695-1 was
similar to that used previously.! Operation of this
loop was terminated after 385 hr because of a leak at
a heating terminal. Examination showed the maxi-
mum attack, which was found in a bend in the first
heating leg, to be 12 mils (Fig. 5.1). In a straight
portion of the heated section, the maximum attack
was to a depth of 9 mils. The depths of attack
were thus only slightly less than those found in
loops which circulated a similar mixture containing
no trivalent uranium; however, the number of voids
was reduced by about one-half.

The second loop examined (4695-2) had been
fabricated with two straight heating sections

connected with a U bend (Fig. 5.2), and it had

operated for 887 hr before being terminated because
of a pump bearing failure.

The maximum attack
was to a depth of 8 mils (Fig. 5.3), and it was
found in the first heated section. A temperature

“study of this loop showed that the maximum wall

temperature occurred in the first heated section
but that the maximum fluoride mixture temperature
occurred in the second heated section. The loop

was assembled so that no heating occurred in the

bend, and, upon examination, no attack was found
A thin, as yet unidentified, deposit
was found in the final portion of the cold leg. For
comparative purposes, a portion of this same batch

of fluoride mixture was circulated for 1000 hr in
on Inconel thermal-convection loop. The hot leg
of the thermal-convection loop was attacked to a
depth of 10 mils, whereas a depth of 13 to 15 mils
was normally found in control thermal-convection
loops in which the fluoride mixture contained UF,
but no trivalent uranium. However, thermal-
convection _ loops operated previously in which
trivalent “uranium was obtained by adding zirconium
hydride were attacked to a depth of only 3 mils.

temperatures occurred in the second heated
section. A deposit that was up to 65 mils thick
was found on the lower inside surface of one area

  

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1955

in the cold portion of the loop. In other areas,
similar deposits that were up to 5 mils thick were
found. A spectrographic analysis of the deposit
showed the following: >5 wt % Cr, 0.5 wt % Fe,
>10 wt % K, 3 wt % Li, 2 wt % Na, 0.5 wt % Ni,
> 10 wt % U (balance unidentified). Another portion
of this batch of fluoride mixture was circulated for
500 hr in an Inconel thermal-convection loop. The
maximum attack was to a depth of 42 mils, and
was unusual in that it was found only around one
third of the circumference of a sample of the hot
leg. In the remainder of the hot leg the attack was
to a depth of 5 mils. A cold-leg deposit that was
0.3 mil thick was found.

Two other forced-circulation loops that had
completed the scheduled 1000 hr of operation were
also examined. These loops had circulated NaF-
ZrF -UF, (53.5-40-6.5 mole %). One of these
loops (4930-A) was heated by the electrical
resistance of a coil, ! and the other (4935-1) was
heated in a gas furnace. These loops were similar
except that the gas-fired loop had a heated length
of 23.5 #, and the heated length of the other loop
was only 7 ft. To transfer the same amount of
power, it was obviously necessary to use a much
higher wall temperature for the short loop. The
maximum attack in the short loop (4930-A) appeared
as a heavy intergranular concentration of sub-
surface voids to a depth of 25 mils and was found
in a bend in the second leg of the heated coil. The
maximum attack in a straight section was 21 mils.
The attack was both deeper and heavier than that
found in loops operated previously with this
fluoride mixture, even when much higher velocities
and Reynolds numbers were used. Examination of
loop 4935-1 showed the maximum attack to be to a
depth of 11 mils; however, this attack was moderate
in intensity and was found for only a short length
at the hottest end of the coil. In this loop no

“differences were found on opposite sides of the

bends. The original purpose of these loops was to
compare gas and electric heating; however, because
of the differences in heater length, it will be
necessary to repeat the tests with identical loops

operated under similar conditions.

From the results obtained with these loops and
from those reported previously, ? it is apparent that

“corrosion and mass transfer in these systems are

not so serious as had been feared. It also appears

that reducing the tube wall temperature in these
experiments would result in a reduction in depth of
attack. The cold-leg layer found in loop 4695-2
must be investigated further,

The depths of attack found in the forced-
circulation loops are not much, if any, greater
than those found in the low-velocity thermal-
convection loops. Thus velocity and Reynolds
number appear to be only minor variables. This
conclusion is confirmed by the deep attack found
in the low-velocity forced-circulation loop 4930-A.
The data obtained from the thermal-convection
loops should therefore be applicable to forced-
circulation systems.

The most important variable is the maximum tube
wall temperature, or, more exactly, the temperature
of the reaction interface. This is shown by the
~ deepest attack occurring in areas of maximum wall
temperature rather than where the maximum bulk
fluoride mixture temperature occurred. Additional

86

evidence is afforded by the deepest attack in a
loop having occurred in the hot spots on the inside
of bends. 2

The addition of UF, to the ZrF j-base mixtures
reduces the attack, and even though the low UF,
concentrations used in these forced-circulation
loops did not reduce the attack as much as had
been hoped, it appears that higher concentrations
would result in a greater decrease in attack.
Unless the addition of UF; can also reduce the
attack and mass transfer found with alkali-metal
base mixtures without disproportionation of the
UF, and the formation of deposits, it appears that
such mixtures will not be useful in large, Inconel
dynamic systems.

trivalent uranium content had been almost com-
pletely lost by disproportionation in all loops.

The results for the three loops with low UF,
contents are encouraging. In loop 594, after

1000 hr, the hot-leg attack was only to a depth of
2 mils, and there was no evidence of a hot-leg
layer (Fig. 5.8). The cold legs of these loops
showed thin, as yet unidentified, layers. Even in
these loops it seems likely that some dispro-

portionation occurred, because one-half the origi-
nal U3* content was lost.

Chemical analyses of the fluoride mixtures
before and after operation of the loops are pre-
sented in Table 5.3. The data show that the
impurities react differently in the alkali-metadl
base mixtures than they do in the ZrF,-base
mixtures. The chromium content appears to de-
crease slightly, whereas the nickel content shows
a small increase.

“Zirconium Fluoride Base Mixtures with

UF, and UF, in Inconel

A group of Inconel thermal-convection loops was
operated at a hot-leg temperature of 1500°F with
the ZrF ,-base mixture NaF-ZrF ,-UF , (50-46-4
mole %) containing varying amounts of the UF,
converted to UF,. Metallographic results have
been received on only the first half of this series
of tests and are reported in Table 5.4. The chemi-
cal results for these tests are given in Table 5.5.
While the depths of attack found were slightly
fower than the 11 mils now being found after 500 hr
in control loops, the results are disappointing in
that, in previous thermal-convection loops operated
with a mixture containing UF, obtained by the
reduction of UF, with ZrH,, attacks as low as
3 mils were found. As in the forced-circulation
loops, the presence of UF; reduces the amount and
intensity of the attack more than it does the depth.
In the loops operated previously, the UF, content
was not known and may have been slightly higher.
It should be noted that the chromium content was

determining whether all the loops should be reduced
to this size.

Evaluation of Control Loop Results

A gradual increase in depth of attack of the
_standard Inconel thermal-convection loops operated
with ZrF ,-base mixtures has been noted recently,
and difficulty has been experienced in reproducing
results. As part of a study of this difficulty, three
Inconel loops were filled the same day from the
same batch of fluoride mixture and operated for
500 hr in as nearly an identical manner as possible.
The data obtained from these experiments are
given in Table 5.8. The attack was again deeper
than in previously operated standard loops, and
the data show no reproducibility. It should also
be noted that in each loop some cold-leg attack

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1955

was found, whereas previously the cold legs
appeared to be attack-free.

To - determine whether the increase in attack
could be caused by a leak during operation or by
air blown into the fluoride mixture during filling,
an additional series of three loops was operated.
in one experiment, 1 liter of air was slowly bubbled
through the fluoride mixture in the fill pot before
transfer to the loop. In the second experiment,
the loop was airtight, but it was operated with the
helium atmosphere at atmospheric pressure. In the
third, the helium atmosphere was again at atmos-
pheric pressure, and, in addition, a Swagelok
connection above the loop was loosened slightly
so that there was a slight air leak. The data from
these loops are presented in Table 5.9. A fourth,
standard loop was operated as a control with the
normal helium atmosphere at a pressure of 7 psi.

The data indicate that to get increased attack
from contamination during operation would require

both an air leak and a loss of helium pressure,
‘a combination which does not seem likely to occur.
It also appears that the small amount of air that
could be trapped in a transfer line would be enough
to cause difficulty. One other possible source of
the increased attack may be the cleaning cycle.
Therefore, a group of loops cleaned by various
procedures have been operated, but the results
‘are not yet available.

GENERAL CORROSION STUDIES

Metallurgy Division

{ Brazing Alloys. on Type 310 Stainless Steel
; and "A" Nickel in Sodium and in Fuel Mixtures

Brazing alloys submitted by the Wall Colmonoy
Corporation have been tested in both static sodium
and in static NaF- ZrF -UF, '(53.5-40-6.5 mole %).

These tests were conducted in an effort to find
a brazing alloy that has good corrosion resistance
to both mediums.

 

The tests were conducted on type 310 stainless
steel T-joints brazed with the brazing alloys listed
in Table 5.10, which also presents the resuits of
exposure to static sodium at 1500°F for 100 hr.
The brazing alloys are listed in order of decreasing

corrosion resistance. The results for tests of
these alloys in static NaF-ZrF ,-UF, (53.5-40-6.5
mole %) are given in Table 5.11, where, as in
Table 5.10, the brazing alloys are listed in order
of decreasing corrosion resistance.

A comparison of the results in Tables 5.10 and
5.11 indicates that brazing alloy B-13 (9% Si-
2.5% P-88.5% Ni) has the best corrosion re-
sistance to both test mediums. Metallographic
examination showed no attack along the surface
of the braze fillet when tested in sodium (Fig. 5.92).
The cracks shown in Fig. 5.92 are not the results
of corrosion, but rather were caused by the brit-
tleness of the alloy. Similar cracking was ob-
served in many of the brazed T-joints listed in
Tables 5.10 and 5.11. Brazing alloy B-13 is shown
in Fig. 5.95 after being tested in NaF-ZrF,-UF,
(53.5-40-6.5 mole %) for 100 hr at 1500°F. Surface
attack to a depth of 1 mil can be seen along the
entire brazed fillet. No cracks can be observed
in this joint.

Several conclusions can be drawn from a study of
the metallographic notes in Tables 5.10 and 5.11,
Brazing alloys containing relatively high per-
centages of phosphorus appear to be inferior in
sodium. However, additions of silicon tend to
improve the corrosion resistance. On the other
hand, brazing alloys having high percentages of

the 65 wt % Ni~25 wt % Ge~10 wi % Cr alloy. The
Coast Metals No. 52 alloy had good corrosion
resistance to the fluoride mixture in the seesaw
test in contrast to its poor resistance in the static
test. A large degree of porosity was present in
Coast Metals No. 50 alloy that hampered the
evaluation of the corrosion data. These two
brazing alloys will be retested in order to check
the results of these seesaw tests.

Screening Tests of Solid-Phase Bonding

The alloys which have been proposed for use in
the fabrication of the ANP reactor fuel and coolant
lines have a tendency to form a solid-phase bond
at elevated temperatures in liquid metals and in

96

fused fluoride salts. Bonding of this type makes
them unsuitable for use in valves, bearings, and
seals; thus cermets and ceramics that do not form
a solid-phase bond are being investigated. The
cermets (metal-bonded ceramics) appear to be the
more promising because of their high corrosion
resistance and other chemical and physicdl
characteristics.

The test apparatus being used is shown in
Fig. 5.11. This apparatus was adapted from that
designed for lever-arm stress-rupture tests. The
container for the central components, for the test
specimens, and for the liquid metal or fused fluo-
ride salt serves as a housing for the compression

tube and upper platen. By using this arrangement

Corrosion-resistant cermets and hard-facing alloys
have been tested in an apparatus fabricated from
Inconel for solid-phase bonding in NaF-ZrF -UF,
(53.5-40-6.5 mole %) for 100 hr at 1500°F. The
test specimens were dimensionally the same
(£0.0002 in.) and the contacting surfaces had
roughnesses of less than 10 pin. The test was

begun by holding the contacting surfaces of the

test specimens apart while the apparatus was
flushed with NaF-ZrF -UF ; (53.5-40-6.5 mole %)
at 1500°F. This was done to ensure that any
surface films on the specimens would be removed
prior to the application of the compression load.

A fresh ‘charge of NaF-ZtF +UF, (53.5-40-6.5

mole %) at 1500°F was then put into the test

chamber, and the test specimens were pressed
together at the desired contact pressure. At the
conclusion of the 100-hr test period, the NaF-ZrF ,-
UF, was removed, and the system was cooled to
room temperature and disassembled.

The contact surfaces of the test specimens were
examined with a low-power microscope for signs
of solid-phase bonding. The seating was not
perfectly uniform in any of the tests, and therefore
the contact pressures between the test specimens
were probably in excess of the calculated values
in certain areas. Table 5.15 is a summary of the
solid-phase-bonding screening tests made at calcu-
lated contact pressures of 6,600, 10,000, and
50,000 psi. [In the most severe tests, that is,
those in which the calculated contact pressure
was 50,000 psi, no bonding was observed, except

apparent relationship to the occurrence of the

that none of these Kentaniums would form solid-
phase bonds to each other in NaF-ZrF,-UF,
(53.5-40-6.5 mole %) at 1500°F in 100 hr if the
true contact pressure between the cermets did not

did bond is planned that will conclude the screen

Sodium in Inconel

A 1000-hr test was recently completed in which
sodium was circulated in an Inconel thermal-
convection loop. Samples of the sodium used in
this test were analyzed and found to contain
approximately 0.03% oxygen. The oxygen content
was admittedly high and could have been reduced

HOT LEG ( 1500°F)

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1955

by a factor of 10 by adequate cold trapping;
however, this test did show how serious that mass
transfer can be even in a thermal-convection loop
when the oxygen content is high. The hot leg of
the loop was held at a temperature of 1500°F, and
the coldest section of the cold leg was held at
1200°F. The mass transfer that occurred was
concentrated in an area in the cold leg where an
air blast had impinged on the tube wall during the
test, as shown in Fig. 5.12. Very little mass
transfer was detected in other sections of the cold
leg. A similar test will be conducted in which the
oxygen content of the sodium will be held below
0.005% to determine the effect the oxygen content
has on mass transfer in a sodium-Inconel system.

Lithium in Type 347 Stainless Steel

Lithium was circulated in two stainless steel
thermal-convection loops for periods of 1000 and
3000 hr, respectively, The hot- and cold-leg
temperatures were 1000 and 550°F, respectively.

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

The loops operated satisfactorily during the test
periods, and macroscopic examination revealed
no mass-transferred crystals in the loops or in the
lithium drained from the loops.

~The hot zone of the loop that operated for 1000 hr
had subsurface voids and a ferritic surface layer
to a depth of 0.3 to 1.0 mil. Lithium metal had
penefrated to this depth. The weld zone of the
pipe in this area was attacked to a depth of 3 mils.
The cold leg of the loop was unattacked; however,
there were a few small (0.2 mil) crystals attached
to the surface. Similar crystals were previously
identified as carbides.

The attack in the hot leg of the loop that oper-
ated for 3000 hr was similar to that found in the
1000-hr test specimen; however, the spongy ferritic
surface layer was 1.0 fo 1.5 mils thick, as shown
in Fig. 5.13. The attack in the weld zone wos
intergranular and extended to a depth of 4 to 5 mils,
as shown in Fig. 5.14. The preferential attack in

 
 
  

the weld zone is due to attack of the grain boundary
carbides by the molten lithium. A deep groove in
the pipe wall may be seen at the weld zone—parent
metal interface.

The cold-leg section (Fig. 5.13) of this loop was
very similar in appearance to that of the loop oper-
ated for 1000 hr. A few small (0.2 mil) carbide
particles were attached to the wall of the tube.

It is believed that the corrosion resistance of
type 347 stainless steel to lithium in this tempera-
ture range would be improved by lowering the
carbon content of the steel and by using seamless
instead of welded pipe. The austenite-to-ferrite
transformation detected in the hot legs of these
loops is attributed to leaching of nickel from the
type 347 stainless steel by the lithium.

FUNDAMENTAL CORROSION RESEARCH

G. P. Smith

Film Formation on Metals

J. V. Cathcart
Metallurgy Division

Most of the work done in the past on the oxida-
tion of metals has been devoted to a study of the
oxidation characteristics of the ‘‘heavy’’ metals
and alloys such as copper, nickel, iron, aluminum,
the stainless steels, etc. These materials either
were structurally important or their physical proper-

‘ties were such as to make them particularly amen-

able to oxidation studies. Comparable investigations
of the alkali and alkaline-earth metals are almost
entirely lacking.

Rather elaborate oxidation theories have been
devised for the heavier metals, but it has been
assumed, in general, that the alkali and alkaline-
earth metals exhibit a linear oxidation rate, in
accordance with the old crack theory of Pilling and
Bedworth. Their theory was that a metal, for
which the ratio of the density of the oxide to that
of the parent metal is greater than unity, should
obey a linear oxidation law. [t was reasoned that
the oxide film formed would be highly subject to
cracking and that, consequently, there would be a
constant re-exposure of fresh metal surface to
oxygen. Thus the rate of oxidation should be
independent of the thickness of the oxide film, the
quantity of oxide formed being directly proportional
to the time of exposure to oxygen.

In order to test the crack theory of oxidation
directly, as well as to obtain experimental data on

the oxidation of the alkali metals, an investigation
of the oxidation characteristics of sodium ial

ary experiments indicated

oxidation mechanisms of copper, aluminum, and
other structural metals,

On the basis of the results obtained with sodium,
it was concluded that a fundamental error existed
in the currently accepted oxidation concepts for
metals that obey a linear oxidation rate law and
that it was therefore desirable to investigate care-
fully the oxidation of some metal that does exhibit
a linear oxidation rate, Columbium was especially
suitable for this study. Below approximately 400°C,
it obeys a parabolic oxidation rate law, while above
this temperature its oxidation rate is linear. At
400°C the initial stages of oxidation also appear
to follow a parabolic rate, but after several hours

"of oxidation the rate increases and becomes almost

linear.® Thus a careful investigation of the structure
and composition of the oxide films formed at or
near 400°C should provide valuable information as
to the conditions which lead to a linear oxidation
rate.

An added incentive for the study of the oxidation
properties of columbium was that this metal pos-
sesses very desirable high-temperature structural
properties. Its use has been limited largely by its
excessive oxidation at high temperatures. It was
believed that further information concerning its
oxidation mechanism would be helpful in overcoming
this defect.

The experimental procedures used and the results
of the studies of sodium and columbium oxidation
are presented below.

Sodium Oxidation. The oxidation rate of sodium
was followed by measuring the change in pressure
in a closed reaction chamber as the reaction pro-
ceeded. A sensitive, differential manometer in
which Octoil-S diffusion pump oil was used as the
manometric fluid served as the pressure-sensing

“device.

The apparatus used is shown in Fig. 5.17. The

“sodium reservoir consisted of a glass bulb closed
“at one end with a thin-walled breck-off tip. The
" teservoir was filled, under vacuum, through a side
“arm, with sodium that had been purified by repeated
“vacuum distillations at a pressure of 1076 to 0 7
‘mm Hg. After the side arm was removed,
‘reservoir was attached to a tube below the

tion bulb, as shown in Fig. 5.17. A small furnace

was built which could be placed around the entire

dpparatus, with the sodium reservoir and the

manometer protruding from suitable holes. The
entire apparatus could thus be baked-out under
vacuum before any sodium was admitted to the
system. Care was taken to load the manometer by
the vacuum distillation of Octoil-S from a separate
bulb into the manometer arms. This procedure

106

assured that the manometric fluid would not act
as a source of appreciable gas.

After a bake-out period of 16 to 20 hr the system
was allowed to cool to room temperature, dnd the
break-off tip above the sodium reservoir was
crushed, The sodium was then distilled into the

 

 

 
 

H

"

i heights. of the

 

tube below the oxidation bulb, and the sodium
reservoir was removed. Finally, the sodium was
distilled into the oxidation bulb and allowed to
condense on the walls, Both these final distil-
lations were made under a pressure of approxi-
mately 2 x 1077 mm Hg. As the last step before
the admission of oxygen, the tube below the oxida-
tion bulb was sealed off, as were the vacuum leads
to the two reference bulbs,

A 50-cc flask served as an oxygen reservoir.
Prior to being attached to the oxidation apparatus,
it was filled with carefully purified oxygen to a
pressure such that when the gas was allowed to
expand into the reference and oxidation bulbs the
resultant pressure was 200 mm Hg. The purification
of the oxygen was accomplished by passing it over
hot copper oxide (to remove hydrogen) and Ascarite
{to remove carbon dioxide) and finally drying it
over magnesium perchlorate and in a liquid-nitrogen
trap.

The tube leading from the oxygen reservoir to the
break-off tip was made of 2-mm capillary tubing.
By thus minimizing the volume above the reservoir,
it was possible in the low-temperature runs to im-
merse the reservoir in a cold bath to precool the
oxygen to the desired reaction temperature.

When the break-off tip above the oxygen reservoir
was smashed, the oxygen passed through the T
connection above the manometer and simultaneously
filled the reference and oxidation bulbs to identical
pressures. The intersection of the tubes of the T
was then collapsed as quickly as possible with a
hand torch. The three arms of the manometer were
thus separated and any change in pressure in the
oxidation bulb resulting from the reaction of sodium
and oxygen wa: ativ

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1955

shown in Fig. 5.17 was used, except that only one
reference bulb was found to be necessary. For
reasons described below, the second reference
bulb: proved very helpful, however, for experiments
at the two lower temperatures.

For all experiments the oxidation and reference
bulbs were immersed in a constant-temperature bath
contained in a 4-liter Dewar flask, Mineral oil
served as the bath liquid for the three higher
temperatures. At -20°C a saturated sodium
chloride—ice bath proved to be satisfactory, and
at 79°C a slurry consisting of powdered dry ice
and a 50-50 vol % solution of carbon tetrachloride
and chloroform was used to attain the desired
temperature. The densities of the liquid phase and
the dry ice in the latter bath were approximately
equal, and thus a slurry was produced in which
there was little tendency for the segregation of the
dry-ice particles.

At -79°C the sodium oxidized at a very slow
rate. The maximum pressure change which oc-
curred in the system as a result of the oxidation
was 0.2 to 0.3 mm Hg. Therefore it was necessary
to pay particularly careful attention to factors
which could cause spurious pressure readings.
One obvious source of error was a temperature dif-
ference between the reference and oxidation bulbs.
This difficulty was overcome by utilizing a relo-
tively thin slurry in the cold bath and stirring it
very vigorously. A less easily corrected source of
trouble was that, of necessity, the reference and
oxidation bulbs were maintained at dry-ice temper-
ature, whereas the manometer and connecting tubes
were at room temperature, A simple gas law calcu-
lation shows that, in such a system, any change in

cold bath at ~79°C was almost as difficult. The
equilibrium temperature of any dry-ice bath is
determined by the sublimation point of carbon

dioxide; however, the constancy of the sublimation

temperature is dependent upon the constancy of the
partial pressure of carbon dioxide above the bath,
Thus, unless the bath is contained in a closed

"vessel, variations in temperature will occur in the

bath because of changes in the partial pressure of
carbon dioxide above it. In addition, the negative
heat of solution of carbon dioxide in carbon tetra
chloride and chloroform caused the temperature of
the bath to fall below the equilibrium sublimation
temperature when the cold mixture was first pre-
pared. Since the bath was contained in a Dewar
flask, the lowered temperature tended to persist
for long periods of time unless a heater was immersed
in the bath.
It was decided therefore that precise temperature
control of the apparatus at —=79°C was impractical.
However, it was essential that some reference
point be established for the bath so that the ap-
paratus could be brought back to the initial con-
ditions of the experiment after, for example, each
renewal of the dry-ice charge in the bath. The
addition of a second reference bulb proved satis-
factory for this purpose. The two reference bulbs
represented a ‘‘differential gas thermometer.”’ It
was observed that within about 10 min after the
start of an experiment a small difference in the
heights of the oil in the reference arms of the
manometer was usually established, This dif-
ference remained constant as long as the temper-
ature of the bath and the room temperature were
unchanged, When deviations in this difference
were observed, it was possible to make slight
alterations in the bath temperature (for example,
by removing part of the cover of the Dewar flask
and thus decreasing the partial pressure of carbon
dioxide above the bath) and thus re-establish the
desired pressure difference in the reference bulbs.
It was recognized that the constancy of the
pressure difference between the two reference
bulbs did not necessarily indicate a corresponding
constancy in the cold-bath temperature. Frequently,
the adjustments in the bath temperature that were

necessary to maintain the pressure difference

represented a counterbalance to changes in room
temperature. The resultant small changes in the
bath temperature meant, of course, a change in the
temperature at which oxidation occurred; but, since

108

the oxidation rate of sodium is not a sensitive
function of temperature at —79°C, this alteration
of the experimental conditions was not considered
to be significant. In any event, as may be seen in
Fig. 5.18, the use of the technique described above
produced excellent agreement of the data for three
separate experiments at ~79°C,

The experimental data obtained at the five temper-
atures investigated are shown in Fig, 5.18. The
change in pressure in the system, which is ob-
viously a function of the thickness of the oxide
film formed, is plotted against the time of oxidation
on a log-log scale. Each curve represents the
composite of data taken from three or more experi-
ments.

Perhaps the most striking feature of the experi-
ments was the slowness with which oxidation
occurred. Very roughly, one unit on the ordinate
scale in Fig. 5.18 is equal to a film thickness of
10 A. Thus at —79°C after 1000 min of oxidation,
the thickness of the oxide film was only about 30
A, while at 48°C, it was 500 A.

Since the curves, as plotted, were not linear,
there was an indication that the data did not fit
any of the conventional oxidation rate equations of
the form

n

x" = kt , n=1273,

where x is the thickness of the oxide film after
time t, and k is the rate constant. The data were
also tested against the logarithmic rate equation

x = klogt ,

but no fit was obtained,

As may be seen from the curves in Fig. 5.18, the
oxidation rates of sodium at —79 and —-20°C de-
crease very sharply after the first 150 to 200 min
of oxidation. This behavior is qualitatively similar
to that predicted by Cabrera and Mott’ for oxidation
processes leading to the formation of very thin
films. The oxide thickness {30 to 40 A) observed
at ~79°C is very close to the thickness range re-
quired by this theory, The data were checked
against the appropriate rate equation

agreement was found, However, the qualitative
similarity between the observed rate curves and
those predicted by the theory suggests that the
results obtained at —79 and —20°C represent an
oxidation process in which the mechanism proposed
by Cabrera and Mott is competing with some second
mechanism. It is hoped to test this idea by making

oxidation measurements “af temperatures below

-79°C.

The very small amount of oxide which was ; formed
“at all temperatures investigated emphasized the
“highly protective character of sodium oxide films
© in carefully dried oxygen. The frequently accepted -
idea that sodium obeys a linear oxidation rate
must be’ discarded. The results also. suggest that

   
 

mechanism for the heavier metals, such as copper
and aluminum. As further details of the oxidation
characteristics of sodium: and other ‘‘ultra-light”

metals) need not be regarded as s being of a ofire-eath,
~ ized nature but may be very similar to the oxidation

metals become available, it may prove possible to
devise a theory of oxidation which is applicable
to at least the low-temperature oxidation of all
metals.

At the present time the oxidation data obtained
at 25°C are being rechecked, and the time of oxi-
‘dation is being extended. It is felt that these ad-
ditional data are required in order to obtain a
meaningful analytical expression for the rate

curves, The measurements at 48°C will also be
extended in a similar manner,
The completion of these rate studies will mark
the end of what might be termed the ‘‘classical”’
‘phase of the investigation of the oxidation of
"sodium, [It is planned that the future work with
sodium will include a study of the surface topogra-
“phy and” sfructure of the sodium oxide films.

not of uniform thickness and that the major portion
of the oxide is contained in nuclei scattered over
the metal surfaces. These findings emphasize the
necessity of combining rate measurements with a
detailed examination of the oxide films formed in
any complete oxidation study.
. Columbium Oxidation. The work on columbium is
in the preliminary stage. It is planned to measure
the rate of oxidation of columbium at several temper-
atures in the neighborhood of 400°C and then to
‘correlate the oxidation rate and oxide layer thick-
ness with the structure and porosity of the oxide.
In this manner it should be possible to establish
the conditions which exist in the film, both when a
parabolic law is obeyed and when the rgte becomes
linear.

A check has been made on the oxidation rate of
columbium at 400°C in highly purified oxygen.
Qualitative verification was obtained of the phe-

nomenon, reported by Inouye,® of the transition of
the oxidation rate from a parabolic to a linear re-
lationship. The initial stages of oxidation pro-
duced oxide films which exhibited interferences
(colors). As the reaction proceeded, however, the
specimens became coated with a white, opaque
oxide film whose surface was rough. The appear-
ance of the white oxide seemed to coincide ap-
proximately with the transition from the initial
parabolic oxidation rate to a linear rate.

individual tests have been conducted in the ‘‘cold-

these tests are not complete, certain patterns of
hydroxide are being observed.

The cold-finger apparatus, which was described
previously,?¢10 consists of any externally heated
bucket of hydroxide into which dips an air-cooled
cold finger. Both the cold finger and the bucket
are constructed of the metal being tested. Thermal
gradients are observed between the outside of the
bucket and the inside of the cold finger so that
there is never thermocouple metal in the hydroxide
bath, All tests have been run for 100 hr, except
as otherwise noted, at the indicated maximum

minimum of 16 hr at 400°C. In some instances,
previously dehydrated hydroxide is used, in which
case, arapid pumping at 400°C is deemed sufficient.

The metals studied to data have been nickel,
Inconel, and Hastelloy B. Of these, nickel and
Inconel show some promise of being suitable for
use with the hydroxide at temperatures of the order
of 600°C. Hastelloy B is by far the least resistant
of the three to attack by the hydroxide, being badly
corroded at 600°C,

The conditions and visual observations of the
tests on nickel are presented in Table 5.16. In no
case was oxidation corrosion observed. Mass
transfer does occur at 600°C, as shown in Fig.
5.19. The cold fingers seen in Fig. 5.19 are
nickel, with the exception of No. 19, which is
Inconel. Bucket temperatures were 600, 630, 670,

transfer with increasing temperature in the range
600 to 700°C. The mass-transferred deposit at the
liquid line, as shown in Fig. 5.20, indicates the
type of metal crystal growth which occurs. This
specimen is a duplicate of No. 21, for which the
bucket temperature was 700°C and the cold-finger
temperature was 600°C.

Several compounds that were chosen for their
strong reducing properties have been added to the
hydroxide melt. It was hoped that these materials,
together with the hydrogen atmosphere, will lower
the mass transfer rate in nickel. Results of tests
with sodium or sodium hydride added to the sodium

hydroxide are shown in Fig. 5.21. All the nickel

cold fingers shown were held at 600°C, and the
bucket temperatures were 700°C. No addition was
made to the sodium hydroxide to which No. 37 was

 

 

exposed, and Nos. 38 through 41, respectively,
were exposed to sodium hydroxide containing 5%
Na, 10% Na, 5% NaH, and 10% NaH, respectively.
In no case did the addition decrease the mass
transfer, The same was true for the third and last
additive tried, sodium hydrogen phosphite.

In all the tests with additives, there was evi-
dence that some, if not most, of the added material
distilled out of the bucket, These same compounds
might be found to be effective in a more confined
system such as a closed loop. No tests have yet

been run at the temperature at which mass transfer

is first noticed, and it is possible that these ad-
ditives might increase the maximum temperature
that can be attained without mass transfer occurring.

The results of tests on Inconel in sodium hy-
droxide are shown in Table 5.17. The mass trans-
fer of Inconel was significantly less than that of

Specimen No. 19 of Fig. 5.19 is an Inconel cold
finger tested under the same conditions as was the
nickel specimen No, 21. The metal deposit on No.
19 is less than that on No. 21, but the tarnish on
No. 19 indicates that there was some corrosion.
Therefore, in the remaining Inconel tests, the
Inconel bucket (that is, the hot zone) was examined
for corrosion. Inconel buckets that were exposed
to sodium hydroxide at bucket temperatures from 450
to 800°C are shown in Figs. 5.22 through 5.26.
It is most interesting to note the change in type
and extent of attack that occurs between 600 and
650°C. At 600°C and below, 1 to 2 mils of grain-
boundary attack may be seen both on the inside
and outside wall of the bucket, The attack on the
outside wall was caused by hydroxide that crept
out over the bucket lip. Above 600°C, an oxidized
layer formed that was 3 to 15 mils in depth. This
temperature sensitivity is, as yet, unexplained.

Other metals are to be studied in an attempt to
raise the temperature limit at which no mass trans-
fer occurs. It is hoped that questions such as what
causes the change in rate and type of attack in the
600 to 700°C range will also be resolved.

rosion in ftilting-furnace tests. After 100-hr ex-
posutes, metallographic observations of the capsule

firmed these findings. The chromium concentration
was found to be about 250 ppm in the LiF-BeF,

During previous work on the equilibrium hydrogen
pressure of the sodium hydroxide—nickel reaction,
it was found that the reproducibility was somewhat
poor. Similar difficulties were observed during
determinations of the equilibrium solubility of the
metal in molten hydroxide. In studying the possible
reaction

the hydrogen pressure or the nickel concentration
was determined as a function of time and tempera-

the reaction chamber connected to a manometer,
and the nickel concentration was determined by
analyzing the contents of a quartz-jacketed metal
capsule after the desired exposure time. Since
the two sets of data were necessarily determined
on separate systems, there was the possibility of
unknown variables being present, even though
every effort was made to keep the variables
identical.

~ This experimental difficulty has recently been

“counteracted by constructing an apparatus that

makes possible simultaneous determinations of

‘the hydrogen equilibrium pressures and the equi-

fibrium nickel solubility. A charge of purified
sodium hydroxide is loaded into a hydrogen-fired
nickel capsule which is sealed under helium and
then placed in a quartz tube that is evacuated and
sealed. The jacketed capsule is heated to the test
temperature for the desired time period. If the

N16

exposure is sufficiently long, the hydrogen pres-
sure developed should be in equilibrium with the
melt, since it should not diffuse through the quartz.
The pressure should be nearly equal inside and
outside the nickel capsule, because hydrogen
diffuses easily through this metal at the tempera-
tures used. Upon completion of the high-tempera-
ture exposure, the capsule is placed in a flanged
metallic cylinder which, after evacuation, is con-
nected to a mercury manometer. A small metal pin
held near the quartz capsule by a metallic bellows
extending through a lateral hole in the cylinder can
then be tapped to break the quartz jacket. The
pressure established in the system can be read on
the manometer, and a simple calculation will give
the pressure inside the quartz capsule before it
was broken.

Calibration tests with capsules containing
hydrogen at a known pressure showed that the

within 1%. After the pressure measurement the
nickel capsule was opened and the hydroxide was

leached out. with the total alkalinity and the dis-
solved nickel being determined on the same sample.
Some of the quartz- -jacketed nickel “capsules”
«containing sodium hydroxide were kept at 800°C
for various lengths of time in order to ascertain

 

 

the time necessary to reach equilibrium. Runs for
long periods ¢ of time were unsuccessful because

 

 

 

of failure of the nickel capsules. It was found
that the nickel content of the hydroxide remained
nearly constant when the time of exposure was
varied considerably, which would indicate that
equilibrium was reached after a short exposure

“fime. The hydrogen pressures determined by this
‘method did not level off as expected, and the

resulting pressure was found to be greatly in
excess of that to be expected from consideration
of the reaction postulated.

Additional fabrication studies of 'Hastelloy B
have increased the evidence that the poor high-
temperature fabricability is related to the impurity
content from which the strength may be derived.
Several nickel-molybdenum binary and ternary al-
loys were studied in oxidation tests and in room-
and elevated-temperature tensile tests. The ter-
nary alloys all included 20% molybdenum plus
nickel and a third heavy element. The results of

additional stress-rupture and tensile property studies

of the nickel-molybdenum alloys are presented.
For comparison with previously obtained data on
the static oxidation of several brazing alloys,
¢yclic tests were run; the static and cyclic data
were similar for tests at 1500°F. Cyclic tests at
1700°F are under way.

Fabrication was completed of a 20-tube Inconel
fuel -to-NaK heat exchanger, the fuel-to-NaK inter-
mediate heat exchanger No. 2, two 500-kw NaK-to-
air radiators, and a liquid metal -to-air radiator de-
signed by the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory.

Special extrusions were made of three billets of
vanadium and four high-purity molybdenum billets
containing 0.7% titanium, and studies of flow pat-
terns of duplex and three-ply materials during im-
pact extrusion were continued. The fabrication of
clad columbium was investigated, and diffusion
barrier studies were made. Additional information
was obtained on the properties of B 6C-Cu mixtures
and a magnesium- -lithium alloy that” are being con-
sidered as ‘rossible shielding ‘materials.

of sound material. The billets were prepared from
a vacuum-melted ingot of commercial Hastelloy B
and were extruded in the as-cast condition. During
subsequent hot reduction of the extruded rod to
sheet, the material cracked severely, and no usable.
material was obtained.

Two extruded tube blanks that had been shipped
to the Superior Tube Co. for reduction to small-
diameter tubing were processed; one blank was
made from wrought material and the other from cast
material. The tube blank made from a vacuum-
melted cast billet fractured during the first reduc-

billet was successfully processed from 1.5-in.-OD,
0.250-in.-wall to 0.187.in,-0D, 0.017-in.-wall seam-
less tubing. It was found that severe reduction
schedules were permissible and that intermediate
stress-relieving heat treatments were unnecessary.

Previously reported experiments! showed that
higher extrusion ratios were attainable if the
Hastelloy B billet was canned in Inconel. There-
fore wrought Hastelloy B billets with and without
Inconel cans have been prepared for further tube

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

An alloy with the nominal Hastelloy B compo-
sition, 4% Fe-28% Mo—-68% Ni, but without the
tramp elements vanadium, silicon, manganese, co-
balt, chromium, tungsten, and aluminum, was pre-
pared for evaluating the effects of impurities on
the fabrication properties of Hastelloy B. Three-
pound vacuum melted slab ingots 0.500 in. thick
were prepared and rolled at 2100°F to 0.150-in.-
thick sheet, This material showed no tendency to
crack during hot rolling under moderate reduction
schedules. The microstructure of the alloy in the
"as-cast condition showed random distribution of a
second phase, which appeared to be an oxide. The
source of this phase might be traced to the starting
material or the melting practice. It is becoming
increasingly evident that the poor high-temperature
fabricability of Hastelloy B is related to the im-
purity content, However, since the superior strength
of commercial Hastelloy B in comparison with that
of Inconel might be derived from these impurities,
mechanical property tests of the pure 4% Fe—-28%
Mo-68% Ni alloy are under way. The preliminary
room-temperature tensile data, presented in Table
6.1, are encouraging in that they show the tensile
strength and ductility to be comparable to those of
the commercial alloy under these test conditions.
Additional mechanical property tests are under way.

Nickel-Molybdenum Binary Alloys, The previ-
ously reported? work on nickel-molybdenum binary
alloys was extended by a study of an 85% Ni--15%
Mo alloy. The dlloys studied previously were
80% Ni-20% Mo, 76% Ni-24% Mo, and 68% Ni-
32% Mo. An oxidation test of the 85% Ni-15% Mo
alloy at 1500°F in static air indicated a lower rate
of oxidation than that observed for the 80% Ni~
20% Mo alloy, but a higher rate than the rates for
the 76% Ni—-24% Mo and 68% Ni-32% Mo alloys.

Therefore additional oxidation tests are planned to
supplement the present data. The presently avail-
able data appear to indicate that the rate of oxida-
tion of these binary nickel-molybdenum alloys is
not a function of the molybdenum content, Two
thermal-convection loops for circulating fluoride
mixture in the 85% Ni-15% Mo tubing are being
fabricated.

Both room- and elevated-temperature (1100 to
1650°F) tensile tests of this alloy have been com-
pleted. Erratic results were obtained in the room-
temperature tests of specimens aged 284 hr at ele-
vated temperatures (1300 to 1650°F). The tensile
strength was low at all test temperatures, and low
elongations were observed at test temperatures
above 1300°F. The results of these tests are given
in Table 6.2.

Nickel-Molybdenum Ternary Alloys, A screening
program was initiated in orderto observe theeffects
of additions of alloying elements to nickel-molybde-
num alloys. The alloy compositions investigated
have all included 20% molybdenum plus nickel and
a third element. The ternary systems that have
been evaluated are:

2% V-20% Mo-78% Ni
1% Zr-20% Mo-79% Ni
1% Ti-20% Mo~79% Ni

2 to 10% Cb-20% Mo-bal Ni
3 to 10% Cr-20% Mo--bal Ni
2% Al -20% Mo -78% Ni

The physical property data obtained for alloys con-
taining 2 to 10% columbium were reported previ-
ously.* The aluminum-molybdenum-nickel alloys
were investigated because of the exceptional creep
properties reported in the literature for this alloy
system. Hot-forgeability studies were conducted
on 100-g arc melts containing from 2 to 10% alumi-
num, but only the alloys containing less than 5%
aluminum were found to be forgeable at 2100°F.
Further studies will be conducted on this alloy
system. a

Vanadium, zirconium, and titanium additions were
investigated in an effort to improve the elevated-
temperature ductility of the 20% Mo—80% Ni alloy.
No difficulties were experienced in the hot rolling
of these alloys.

Preliminary
data for the alloys containing aluminum, vanadium,
zirconium, and titanium in both the annealed and
aged conditions are presented in Table 6.3. All

Room-temperature tensile strength data for chro-
mium-molybdenume«nickel specimens subjected to
various heat treatments are listed in Table 6.5.
The data reported are the average of the results
of two fo three tests of each alloy. Included in the
tests were alloys that contained additions of 0.5%
columbium or up to 0.25% cerium. The minor ad-
ditions of columbium appeared to increase slightly
the tensile strength and ductility of these alloys,
and an average decrease of 5% in elongation and
a slight increase in tensile strength were noted
for the alloys with small amounts of cerium added.

The elevated-temperature tensile strengths of
chromium-molybdenum-nickel alloy specimens after
various aging treatments are given in Table 6.6.
All the specimens were tested at the aging temper-
atures listed. The results are given for single
tests, The elevated-temperature ductilities of these
alloys are low compared with the ductilities at
room temperature, The minor additions of cerium
apparently aided in obtaining higher elevated-
temperature strengths in these alloys, but more
tests are needed to verify this observation. No
relationship between the physical properties and
the chromium content is readily apparent in either
room- or elevated-temperature tests.

In the temperature range above 1300°F the alloys
containing up to 10% chromium appear to be single-

STRESS-RUPTURE STUDIES OF NICKEL-
MOLYBDENUM ALLOYS

Hastelloy B

A series of creep-rupture tests on Hastelloy B
in the solution-annealed condition has been com-
pleted in an argon atmosphere at 1500 and 1650°F.
The results are summarized in the design curves
presented in Figs, 6.1 and 6.2, A similar series of
tests in fused salts is nearing completion that
provides an interesting comparison with the argon
results,

Stress-rupture plots are presented in Fig. 6.3
for Hastelloy B in the two environments at 1300,
1500, and 1650°F, and it may be noted that at each
temperature the values obtained in fused salts are
actually superior to those obtained in argon. Al-
though no adverse effect on physical properties
was expected, in view of the absence of corrosive
attack of the fused salts on Hastelloy B under
static conditions, the reason for the increase in
rupture strength is not entirely clear at present.

The test chamber must be flushed with a cleaning
charge before the fluoride mixture to be used for
the test is admitted, and therefore the specimens
tested in fused salts were at temperature approxi-

124

mately 5 hr longer before stress was applied than
were the specimens tested in argon. Consequently,
the slightly longer aging of the specimens tested
in the fused salt may account for the improvement
in strength, There are objections to this theory,
however. A specimen aged 70 hr prior to stressing
and testing in argon showed inferior properties
relative to those of a comparable unaged specimen
tested in argon. Also, there is some doubt as to
whether aging can account for the improvement at
1650°F, since the phase diagram, if minor ele-
ments are neglected, indicates a one-phase region
at this temperature. (Photomicrographs, however,
have shown evidence that aging at this temperature
under stress does occur.) Other tests are being
carried out to establish the exact causes for the
apparent anomaly in strengths in the two environ-
ments, Co
Tests in hydrogen and air also have been made
in order to determine the effects of these environ-
ments on the creep-rupture properties of Hastelloy
B at 1500°F. The creep curves obtained at 12,000
psi in hydrogen, argon, air, and fused salt are
shown in Fig. 6.4. In comparison with the effect
of argon, the effect of hydrogen is apparently
negligible, and the effect of air follows closely
the pattern observed for Inconel and *‘A’ nickel
in air, insofar as reduced creep rate and longer
rupture life are concerned. However, the final
elongations of Hastelloy B in air are equivalent
to or lower than those in argon, whereas the elon-
gation of other nickel-base alloys are markedly
greater in air than in argon. A test program simi-
lar to that carried out on solution-annealed Hastel-
loy B has been initiated on solution-annealed
specimens aged 100 hr at 1300°F to determine

over a wide range of Reynold numbers (cf. Sec. 2,
‘Experimental Reactor Engineering’’). The design
of this heat exchanger specified that the 3 % gine -0D,
0.017-in.-wall Inconel tubes were to be oined to a
dished header at the NaK inlet end and to a radial
header at the NaK outlet end. A thick-walled
Inconel pressure shell was to be used to confine
the molten fuel located outside the tubes.

The fabrication techniques used on this heat
exchanger consisted essentially in manual heliarc
welding and subsequent back brazing of the tube-
to-header joints. All welding was performed by
qualified operators’ using specified procedures,
and complete penetration was utilized, except on
the tube-to-header joints. Complete protection of
the roots of the welds by an inert gas was em-
ployed at all times to minimize scaling and oxida-
tion. The tube-to-header joints were back brazed
to eliminate the ‘‘notch effect’’ resulting from
incomplete weld penetration and to ensure against
the development of leaks in the event of corrosion
through an area of shallow weld penetration.

An evaluation of the corrosion resistance of

* brazing alloys had shown that low-melting Nicro-

braz? was compatible with both sodium and the
fused fluoride salts, and therefore this alloy was
used in the back-brazing process, which was per-
formed in a dry-hydrogen atmosphere by using the
conventional ‘*canning’’ procedures. Two brazing
operations were required because the Globar pit
furnace available did not possess a heating zone
of sufficient length to heat both ends of the unit to
the brazing temperature. A *‘window’’ was removed
from the pressure shell to permit preplacement of
the brazing alloy on the NaK inlet end of the tube
bundle, as shown in Fig. 6.8. The window was
welded shut after placement of the alloy, and

helium leak-testing indicated that all ‘welded ‘and

brazed joints were leaktight.

Back Brazing of Tube-to-Header Joints. The
low-melting Nicrobraz alloy was preplaced on the
headers as a dry powder and then secured firmly
in position with a methylacrylate cement. Since
the heating zone of the Globar-heated brazing
furnace was not long enough for a complete tube
bundle, only one end of the tube bundle could be
brazed at a time. As a result, it was necessary
that the complete welding and brazing of one
header on one end of a tube bundle be done prior
to the brazing alloy preplacement dnd header
welding of the other end so as to avoid spalling
of the preplaced brazing alloy from the underside
of the cold header during the brazing of the first
header, It was thought that hot hydrogen gas
might volatilize the binder on the cold header and
leave the brazing alloy insecurely positioned in

along the bundle, with alternate spacers positioned
90 deg to each other. It was required, for the

“whereas on the second bundle they were placed in

a plane at a 30-deg angle to the tubing axis. Both

care also had to be maintained when the holes

Joining of Two Tube Bundles. The two tube

pleted unit is shown in Fig, 6.15, It may be seen
that the joining operation required several manual
heliarc welds to connect the NaK circuits and to

tween the two Inconel sheets acted as a sump to
accommodate any excess brazing alloy.

Assembly of Headers. The original design for
the radiators required that all tubes enter the
cylindrical headers normal to the curvature at the
point of entrance. Sample specimens were prepared
to determine the tube-bending and fitting techniques,
but the complex tube design caused extreme diffi-
culties in placing the headers on the tubes.
Therefore a new design was proposed and accepted
that utilized a split header of 3-in. schedule-40
pipe so that all tubes except the two outside rows
on each radiator half-section entered the headers
without being bent.

Careful hand polishing of each of the tubes was

“required to permit assembly of the split headers
without the use of additional force from a hand
press.” Precision drilling and deburring of the
headers were also employed to prevent bending

~~ and distortion of the thin-walled Inconel tubes.

BR

After assembly of the headers, the tubes were
meticulously hand filed to conform to the exact
curvature of the interior surfaces. Abrasive
grinding or wet milling was avoided because
entrapped abrasive or lubricant would lead to
inconsistencies during tube-to-header welding.

Welding. The tube-to-header joints were manu-
ally heliarc welded, and a helium backup atmos-
phere was maintained on the underside of the joint
throughout welding. The split headers, nozzles,
and end plates were also welded by using manual
heliarc welding techniques. Extreme care was
taken to ensure complete penetration and good
coverage by the backup gas. -

After the manifold welds were completed, the
integrity of the system was determined by helium
leak-testing. Although it was assumed that pin-
hole leaks could be sealed during the subsequent
brazing operation, large leaks were to be avoided.

When questionable welds were found, the headers

cover and inlet tube was designed to permit
relatively even flow throughout the entire frontal
area, and good circulation of hydrogen was ob-
tained around the tube-to-header joints.

The radiator was securely supported on a strong-
back to prevent sagging or distortion during the
high-temperature brazing cycle. The support bars
were made from stainless steel which had been
previously aluminized at 1500°F. This alumi-
nizing prevented the support bars from being brazed
to the radiator, since an aluminum oxide film
prevents wetting by Coast Metals alloy No. 52,

The radiator was placed in the brazing can with
four thermocouples attached in various positions
around the periphery. This temperature measure-
ment around the radiator was desirable from a
contrel standpoint, even though previous experi-
ments had indicated that all parts of a unit of this
size could be held to within 25°C at the brazing
temperature. In the preliminary experiment, 12
thermocouples were attached at various points
over the test specimen. This close control was
necessary because the fiow temperature of the
brazing alloy is 1020°C, and the copper in the
fins melts at 1083°C.

The thermal cycle used in brazing these radiators
is shown in Fig, 6.17. The unit was placed in the
furnace at room temperature to minimize distortion
and was gradually raised to the brazing temper.

Cornell Radiator Ne. 1

The assembly and partial fabrication of a full-
scale liquid metal-to-air radiator designed by the
Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory were described
previously.!® Since the header plates on this heat
exchanger were % in, thick, the brazed tube-to-
header joints cracked easily, Severe stresses re-
sulted from the differences in thermal expansion
coefficients between the stainless steel base metal
and the brazing alloy. However, an investigation
of several high-temperature brazing alloys revealed
that Coast Metals alloy No, 50 possessed suffi-
cient ductility to overcome this cracking upon furs
nace cooling from its brazing temperature of 2050°F,
Other brazing alloys such as Coast Metals alloy
No. 52 and G-E alloy No. 62 cracked to such an
extent that they were not considered satisfactory
for this application,

Since brazing with Coast Metals alloy No. 50,
which is a nickel-silicon-boron-iron alloy, would
necessarily result in the diffusion of boron into
the type 316 stainless steel base metal, an inves.
tigation was conducted to determine the extent of
penetration and the effects on the mechanical prop-
erties of the base metal. Metallographic examina-
tion of typical brazed tube-to-header joints indi-
cated that the diffusion was minor (2 to 3 mils),
even though long-time heating and cooling cycles
were used. Samples examined after subsequent

to the same extent, After 100 hr at 1650°F, the
diffusion had progressed to 4 to 5 mils. Several

a study could be made of the effects of brazing on
the mechanical properties. Tests at room temper-

SPECIAL MATERIALS STUDIES
Special Alloy Extrusions

Three billets of vanadium were extruded at
2000°F. The pressure required for an extrusion
ratio of 9:1 was approximately 45 tsi. The billets
“were canned in mild steel to protect the vanadium
from oxidation during extrusion. The canning
material was removed from the extruded tube
blanks by pickling in hot HCl. The tube blanks
have been shipped to the Superior Tube Co. for
further reduction and cladding on the outside with
“stainless steel. The clad tubing will be used in
corrosion studies.

140 )

 

Four high-purity molybdenum billets containing
0.7% titanium were extruded into rod to be used
for welding studies at Battelle Memorial Institute.
The extrusions were made at 2600°F, and it was
demonstrated that the pressure required could be
reduced by using a salt-type lubricant, These
billets failed to extrude in the first two attempts
when Fiberglas and Necrolene were used as the
lubricating materials. Since the salt lubricant
thermally decomposes at 2600°F, it was swabbed
onto the container walls. The use of salt in the
container reduced the pressure required from 700
to 427 tons on a 3-in. ram for an extrusion ratio

of 4.5:1. Similarly, at an extrusion ratio of 6.25:1,

the pressure required was reduced from 700 to
508 tons.

The studies of flow patterns of duplex and
three-ply materials during impact extrusion were
continued. The flow pattern studies of three-ply
composites have been directed toward the pro-
duction of stainless steel seamless tubular fuel
elements. The experiments on duplex materials
are designed for studying the fabrication problems
involved in the cladding of tube materials. Six
additional extrusions of composite stainless steel~
mild steel billets have been completed.” The
results of the extrusions have not been completely
evaluated, but it appears that material recovery
may be improved by tapering the billet nose to
conform with the cone of the die. ‘

Clad-Columbium Fabrication

J. H. Coobs H. Inouye
Metallurgy Division

M. R. D'Amore, Pratt & Whitney Aircraft

Roll-Cladding Experiments. A series of tests
have been made of various combinations of heat-
resistant alloys roll clad onto columbium. - The
experiments were designed for determining the
lowest temperature at which bonding could be
achieved to minimize intermetallic formation and
contamination (the reactivity of columbium with
gases increases with temperature). In addition,
attempts were made to bond columbium to columbium
in order to develop a method for obtaining large
sheets of the metal. Rolling temperatures of 900,
1050, and 1250°C were investigated. Metallo-
graphic examinations of the columbium to columbium
combinations prepared showed that the interfaces
between the layers were not discernible at high

magnifications after hot rolling at all temperatures
investigated. Separation did not occur upon severe
bending. It, therefore, appears feasible to obtain
large sheets of columbium by this method.

In the investigation of heat-resistant alloys as
roll claddings for columbium, maintaining the
metallurgical bonds necessary for heat transfer
was expected to be difficult because of the differ-
ences in thermal expansion, as shown in the
following:

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1955

It was further expected that brittle intermetallic
compounds would form between nickel and co-
lumbium and between iron and columbium.,

Service tests of columbium clad with these heat-
resistant alloys were made at 815 and 1000°C for
500 hr. The columbium was found to be adequately
protected, and the effects on ductility were slight.
Interface reactions were, however, evident in all
combinations, and there was, as a result, sepa-
ration at the interfaces.

The interface of the Inconel-columbium composite
after rolling at 1050°C is shown in Fig. 6.21. A
discontinuous layer about 0.0001 in. thick is
evident. The reaction layers increased in thick-
ness with the rolling temperature. The same com-
posite is shown in Fig. 6.22 after heating at 815°C

for 500 hr. The reaction layer is only about

0.0005 in. thick, but it is sufficiently thick to
cayse separation upon cooling of the composite
from the test temperature to room temperature.
Voids caused by unequal diffusion rates of the
elements are evident in the Inconel layer.

columbium composites tested at 1000°C for 500 hr
are shown in Figs. 6.23 and 6.24. The reaction
layer in these composites is about 0.0015 in.
thick, and the brittle nature of the reaction layer
is exhibited by the transverse cracks. Similar
results were obtained for other composites of heat-
resistant alloys and columbium.

Diffusion Barrier Studies. The use of a diffusion
barrier for preventing separation at the interface
of the cladding and the columbium was investi-
gated. Copper was selected for this study on the
basis of the results of some brazing work reported
by the Fansteel Metallurgical Corp. A 0.001-in.
layer of copper was roll clad onto columbium at
1000°C from an evacuated capsule. Examination
of specimens tested for 150 hr at 815°C showed

‘two reaction layers totaling about 0.0001 in. in

thickness, and separation at the bonded interface
was slight or nonexistent.

142

If, after additional experimentation, copper is
found to be a suitable barrier for columbium, an
additional barrier for the copper will be necessary
if the external cladding is to be Inconel. Previous
work has shown, however, that iron or the 300
series stainless steels are satisfactory barriers
between copper and Inconel.

Magnesium-Lithium Alloy

D. A. Douglas J. H. DeVan
J. W. Woods

Metallurgy Division

A magnesium-lithium alloy is being considered
as a possible shield material for use in the con-
struction of an aircraft crew compartment. Ad-
ditions of lithium to magnesium reportedly bring
about a reduction in tensile strength while greatly
increasing tensile ductility, particularly in the
case of alloys containing more than 10.3% lithium. 15
Such alloys have a body-centered cubic lattice
structure.

Tensile Properties, In order to evaluate the
properties of alloys containing relatively large
percentages of lithium, a slab ingot having the
composition 80% Mg-20% Li was obtained from
Dow Chemical Company and was rolled at 200°F
to a sheet 0.060 in. in thickness. Specimens
having a Yin. reduced gage section were machined
from the sheet, and tensile and creep tests were
conducted on the alloy in air. Results of tensile
tests completed at room temperature and at 200°F
are listed in Table 6.11. A comparison of these

“values with the room-temperature properties of

pure magnesium, given in Table 6.12, points out
the decrease in strength and the increase in
ductility brought about by the alloy addition.

There is very little capacity for work-hardening
in the alloy, as indicated by the small difference

strengths are quite temperature sensitive, since
at 200°F they have been reduced by a factor of 4
below the strengths at room temperature,

Creep-Rupture Properties. Creep-rupture tests on
the alloy were initiated at room temperature at
7350 and 1500 psi. At the higher stress the test
was discontinued after 7 hr when the presence
of numerous cracks indicated impending failure
to be only a matter of minutes away. Final elonga-
tion for the specimen, measured over a 3-in. gage
length, was 20%. The test of the specimen stressed
at 1500 psi is still in progress after 3200 hr.

Welding of Columbium Thermal-Convection Loops

P. Patriarca G. M. Slaughter
Metallurgy Division

Several type 310 stainless-steel-clad columbium
thermal-convection loops were fabricated for test-
ing to obtain information on resistance to dynamic
corrosion. In preparation for the fabrication of
these loops, test specimens of 0,020-in. columbium
sheet were machine-heliarc-welded with both argon
and helium as the shielding gases. It was found
that when excellent shielding was utilized, welds
made with both gases were ductile. However,
manual welds on the same material were found to
be quite brittle, and thus it appeared that the high
welding speed possible with machine welding was
beneficial, The high rate of travel minimized the
time interval over which the weld metal was molten,

144

with a consequent decrease in the quantity of
atmosphere contamination.

Since most of the welds could not be made by
machine - welding, dry-box manual welding of the
clad-columbium loops was initiated with a helium
atmosphere in the chamber. A loop was fabricated
which was pressure-tight to 35 psi helium; how-
ever, several extremely small pin holes were
found upon leak testing of the loop with a mass-
spectrometer helium leak detector. Since these
pin holes were attributed to the difficulty of torch
manipulation inherent in the use of helium, argon
was used in the dry-box during the fabrication of
four subsequent loops. These were all found to be

leaktight. The welding of the stainless steel
cladding was completed according to normal
practice.

Dimensional Stability Test
on an Inconel Spun Core

P. Patriarca
Metallurgy Division

A proposed design for the core shell of the ART
calls for the yse of a spun Inconel configuration,
and therefore an investigation was conducted to
determine the dimensional stability of a small-
scale specimen (Fig. 6.25) obtained from Pratt &
Whitney Aircraft. The stability of this configura-
tion was tested by measuring the distances be-
tween several reference points both before and
after thermally cycling from 1500°F to ambient

- ‘Brozing of Cermets to Inconel
Pp. Patriarca Ra
TH Metallurgy Division

  

The use of cermet valve seats has been proposed
“for certain high-temperature fused fluoride fuel

applications. Cermets composed of titanium carbide
with a nickel binder (Kentanium type) are among

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1955

those most likely to be used (cf. Sec. 5, ‘‘Cor-
rosion Research’’), If these valve seats are to be
brazed to an Inconel valve body, the brazed joint
must be sufficiently ductile to withstand the stres-
ses created by unequal thermal expansion co-
efficients (10.2 x 107% in./in./°F for Inconel and
4.0 x 107% t0 5.7 x 1078 in./in./°F for the cermets).
In addition the brazed joint must possess adequate
strength and corrosion resistance at temperatures
to 1500°F.

Good wetting of the cermet has been obtained by
using Electroless-plated nickel-phosphorus brazing
alloy. '® Satisfactory joints have been obtained
with a 0.0001-in. layer of nickel-phosphorus followed
with a 0.003- to 0.004-in. layer of electroplated
copper. The addition of a nickel shim between the
plated cermet and the jnconel is desirable, since
it serves as a cushion to dissipate the thermally
induced stresses in the joint. During the brazing
operation, the nickel-phosphorus melts at approxi-
mately 1740°F and wets the Kentanium surface;
continually increasing the temperature then melts
the copper, which alloys with the nickel-phosphorus
to form a ductile joint.

A test sample was prepared that satisfactorily
withstood two air cools from 1700°F. |t was com-
posed of a V x % x 2 in. Kentanium 150A cermet
(90% Tic- 10% Ni) brazed to a Yr in. Inconel plate
along a % x 2 in. face. A ¥ -in. nickel shim was
incorporated in the joint, The specimen was
severely cracked, but, as can be seen in Fig.
6.26, the joint remained sound. Sample joints are
now being prepared for tensile tests.

properties of high density, strength, corrosion

specimens are presented in Table 6.14,

Both Sm,0, and Gd,0, sintered at 1500°C to
form ceramics of good strength, High resistance
to thermal shock would not be expected because
the coefficients of thermal expansion are rather
high. The oxide Gd, 0, sintered at both 1300 and
1500°C was stable in boiling water; however,
Sm,0, sintered at 1500°C was not stable,

A mixture of the oxides (available commercially)
containing 63.8% Sm, 0, and 26.3% Gd 20; (balance,
other rare-earth oxides) was fabricated 3nto cylin-
ders, and these specimens have been tested in the
critical experiment (cf. Sec, 3 “Critical Experi-
ment'’), After heat treatment at 1500°C, the
cylinders had a density of 10.94 and a porosity of
8%, and they were stable in boiling water. They
were machined to the following dimensions: ¥,-in.-
OD, %-in.-ID, 0.8-in.-long hollow cylinders, and
0.45-in.-0D, 3,-in.-long solid cylinders to fit into

UO, Particles Coated with ZrO,

In anticipation of a possible need for protecting
particles of UO, from reaction with molten silicon
in the development of an SiC-Si fuel element, a
technique was developed by Shevlin, at the Chio
State Experiment Station, for coating particles of
UC, (20 to 50 mesh) with a thin layer of ZrO,.
This was done by heating the particles to about
500°F in an open-topped container on a hot plate.
While this container was vibrated mechanically to
agitate the particles, they were sprayed with a
solution of ammonium zirconyl carbonate. Under
these experimental conditions, droplets of the
solution were dried, the salt was decomposed, and
the oxide (ZrO,) product was deposited on the
UO. surface to form a continuous film, which was
difficult to remove by rubbing. It appears possible
to use this process to form diffusion barriers which

‘would prevent UO, from reacting with aluminum and

other metals, Attempts will be made to deposit

ALO, and NiO coatings on UO, by this process,
“and it is planned to heat-treat ZrO, and Al, 0, to
“explore the possibility of consolidating the coat-
“ings. Heat treatment of NiO under reducing con-

ditions will also be investigated to determine the
practicability of producing nickel coatings in this
manner.

A static gas test in which a plate of graphite is

Little, if any, reaction was noted when the graphite

most of the water impurities was blown through the
tube at several hundred feet per second while the
tube was heated to 2300°C. There was no con-
clusive evidence that any significant reaction took
place between hydrogen and graphite in this test;
however, there was evidence of reaction between
water impurity in the gas and graphite.

the ART core for momentary periods of flow
stagnation near the wall. The results of a theo-

6.5 mole %) flowing in an Inconel tube gave results
which were 24% below the general heat transfer
correlation. Two possible explanations for this
discrepancy are that there may have been errors

in temperature measurement or that an additional }
thermal resistance ‘may "have been present at the’
fluid-metal interface. Calibration of the mixing-

chamber a d tube- wall thermocouples revealed no

in Fig. 7.1. The results suggest that two-phase
flow does not occur in this system, because the
friction factor measurements fall near the general
single-phase curve. The influence of a nonwetting
fluoride on forced-convection heat transfer is not
yet known.

The heat transfer characteristics of the mixture
NaF-KF-LiF-UF, (11.2-41-45.3-2.5 mole %) are
currently being investigated. Preliminary results
for an Inconel system, shown in Fig. 7.2, lie 40%
below the general heat transfer correlation. A
fragile green film was found on the inside surface
of the tube. X-ray and petrographic examination
revealed only the constituents of the salt. Further
heat transfer studies are planned, for which a
stainless steel test section will be used. Pressure:
drop measurements are also to be made.

A small-scale loop that is to include a cen-
trifugal sump pump has been designed and is being
fabricated. The proposed system is shown sche-
matically in Fig. 7.3. The fluid flow rate will be
obtained by weighing the salt as it empties into
a weigh tank suspended within a weigh chamber.
The weigh tank will be arranged so that it can be
rapidly emptied. The sump well will be used to
maintain the liquid level in the pump during the
weighing operation.

A full-scale ART fuel-to-NaK heat exchanger tube

“bundle (100 Inconel tubes, 6 ft long, Ye in. OD,

0.017-in. wall thickness) was assembled, instru-
mented, and studied as a water-to-water heat ex-
change “system (Fig. 7.4). Cold water was circu-
lated through the tubes (NaK side) at Reynolds

numbers of sufficient ‘magnitude to produce low and

calculable thermal resistances; hot water was
circulated around the tube bundle in a parallel

“direction (fuel side).” The inlet and outlet tempera-
tures ‘of both streams were measured by two
"thermocouples located in each of the four mixing

chambers. The “‘fuel’’ side was instrumented with
static pressure taps. Both flow rates were measured

a laminar type of flow. No effect of the screens
could be observed with rotational flow.

A two-dimensional diffuser has been designed
which permits a variation of diffuser geometries
and cross-sectional area ratios. The entire diffuser
section is to be made of Plexiglas so that the flow
can be studied by the flow-visualization system.
The assembly is now being fabricated.

A preliminary feasibility study is at present
being made on the control of the boundary layer
in the core for the purpose of preventing separation
of the boundary layer. A boundary layer suction

“technique is being considered.

A plastic 10/44-scale model of the 21-in. core
has been designed and is now being fabricated.
The odd scale was chosen to make the model fit
the available testing facility.

REACTOR CORE HEAT TRANSFER

H. F. Poppendiek N. D. Greene
L. D. Palmer
Reactor Experimental Engineering Division

The hydrodynamic studies being made for the
ART core indicate that when separation regions
exist they are often characterized by repetitive,
short periods of flow stagnation. A study was
made of the temperature and tensile stress fluctu-
ations in the Inconel core wall that result from
these periods of flow stagnation. The following
idealized system depicting the ART core wall
during a short period of flow stagnation was con-
sidered. It was postulated that a layer of fuel
contiguous to the Inconel wall suddenly stagnated
for a period of 0.1 sec under the volume heat flux
condition of 5 kw/cm3. This flux is representative
of the conditions in the ART because of the high
flux peak at the wall. After a 0.1-sec time interval
the fuel and wall temperature would rise about
260°F if no heat transfer were present; transient
heat conduction into the Inconel wall, however,
would reduce this temperature rise. A numerical
composite-slab heat transfer analysis was made
for this problem, and the results indicate that the
Inconel-fuel interface temperature would rise about
60°F in 0.1 sec. This temperature rise would, of
course, be much smaller if the thermal conductivity
of Inconel were not so poor. The corresponding
elastic thermal stress for this temperature fluctu-

~~ ation was found to be about —15,000 psi. These

results suggest that the fluid flow in the core
should not be allowed to fluctuate.

154

All mechanical components, including the power
supply, of the volume heat source experiment for
reactor cores with nonuniform flow cross section
have been constructed and installed. System leak
testing and flow calibration are now being carried
out. An “infinitely’’ adjustable power input (that
is, 15 to 100 kw) to the test section will be pos-
sible by means of several saturable reactors that
have been shown to possess excellent voltage

regulation characteristics under the desired load.

The electrical and power instrumentation is nearing
completion. The temperature structure within an
insulated, divergent test channel will soon be
studied for low power densities.

Several heat transfer analyses that are useful in
predicting the thermal structure within a circulating-
fuel reactor core have been completed. A report
is being prepared which tabulates some of the
detailed temperature profiles derived for the forced-
convection volume-heat-source systems described
previously. 112 These temperature data will make
it possible to determine rapidly the complicated,
radial, fuel-temperature profiles in circulating-fuel
reactors whose pipe or channel ducts are being
cooled at the walls. Also, a transient temperature
solution was derived for the case in which fuel
stagnates momentarily next to the Inconel core
shell. Another analysis was concerned with a
boundary layer temperature solution where a
volumetric heat source exists in the fluid; thermal
and hydrodynamic boundary layers are not presumed
to be equal.

plates system is shown schematically in the upper
inset of Fig. 7.8; it consists of three parallel and
equally spaced vertical copper plates, 8 in. wide
and 36in. high, with a channel width, Xr of 0.5 in.
Plastic bottoms and ends make leakproof containers
of the two free-convection channels, which are
filled with a dilute electrolyte (HC! in H,0).
With the two outer plates grounded and the center
plate maintained at a given a-c voltage, heat is
generated uniformly within the electrolyte. The
heat thus generated is transferred by free con-
vection to the outer walls and then through the
outer walls to the coolant channels in which
cooling water flows vertically upward. Thermo-
couple probe wells were provided so that the
temperature within each wall could be measured
at various vertical levels in the system. The
variables measured were coolant flow rate and
temperature rise, power input to the apparatus,
and the three wall temperatures at various levels.

A theoretical analysis for laminar flow was made
that was based on the postulates that, in the region
awdy from the top or bottom, the velocity profile
becomes fully established and unidimensional and
that the temperature becomes linear with the
vertical coordinate, z, and has the same vertical
gradient, A, as the coolant mixed mean tempera-
ture. Both velocity and temperature solutions
were obtained. The maximum temperature at a
given level occurs at the center wall. The
equation for the dimensionless center wall tempera-

ture, ®(0), follows, and ®(0), N;, and Nj, are

defined on Fig. 7.8:

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1955

Semiquantitative visual observations of the paths
of suspended droplets indicated that the free-
convection circuit existed as one long cell and
that the velocity profile became established in the
middle region and was similar to that predicted by
the theoretical analysis. The onset of turbulence
occurred af a Grashof modulus of 5 x 107, the
same as that for ordinary free convection.

A curve is given in the lower inset of Fig. 7.8
that shows the typical vertical variation of the
experimental ®(0). In comparing the laminar regime
minimum ®(0) data with the theory, it is seen that,
for Ny less than 1300, the data are about 20%
lower than the theory; this is good agreement. For
these data, A was uniform and approximately equal
to A _, the coolant mixed mean temperature gradient.
For the data (not shown here) for which Ny, was
greater than 1300, A was definitely not uniform;
it was as much as ten times greater than A; and
the ®(0) data were 50% lower than the theory.

From the turbulent regime data, it is seen that
free convection can reduce the maximum tempera-
ture difference in such systems to at least one
tenth that which would be present if the heat were
transferred by conduction alone.

Variables not defined on Fig. 7.8 are: %, thermal
conductivity; g, acceleration due to gravity; f3,
temperature - coefficient of expansion; a, thermal
diffusivity; v, kinematic viscosity; and §, volume
heat source term.

The enthalpies and heat capacities of the first

using the Bunsen ice calorimeters. In view of the
present importance of the zirconium fluoride-base
fuels, however, it was felt desirable to determine
these properties with the more precise copper-
block calorimeters.

The heat capacities of liquid fluoride mixtures
may be predicted within about 15% on the basis of
their chemical composition. It has been found that
the product of the heat capacity (cal/g:°C) and

major difficulty in using the apparatus as originally
designed was the lack of sufficient guard heating
to assure pure radial heat flow.

A flat-plate system is now being investigated.
The liquid is contained in cells consisting of two
parallel flat plates of metal joined at the edges
with 10-mil-thick sheet metal. The conductivity
of the liquid in the cell can be calculated by
knowing the area of the plates and the distance
between them and by measuring the amount of heat
passing from one plateto the other and the tempera-
ture differences between them. Some preliminary
data on a ZrF -base fluoride mixture are currently
being obtained that are in agreement with previous
conductivity data obtained with the variable-gap

ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY

Reactor Experimental Engineering Division

Conductivity studies of several aqueous electro-
lytes have indicated the presence of a considerable
amount of polarization within the experimental,
platinum conductivity cell. Accordingly, a second
potential electrode will be installed, which, when
used in conjunction with an electrometer having a
10-megohm input, should reduce the effects of
polarization. Similar conductivity measurements of
some nonaqueous electrolytes (molten salts) will
be made to compare the differences in the degree
of polarization between the two types of electro-
lytes.

Solid State Division

Preliminary results from a series of MTR irradi-
ations of Inconel capsules designed to compare
UF,- and UF ;-base fuels show no corrosion, no
significant uranium segregation, and no changes
in concentrations of impurities in the fluoride
mixture. The loop in which a fuel mixture was
circulated in the LITR has been sectioned, and
preliminary examinations have been made. The
miniature loop designed for operation in a vertical
hole .in the LITR is in the final stages of assembly,
and charcoal traps to delay fission gases in the
event of a rupture have been tested and incorporated
in the cooling-air off-gas line.

A tube-burst stress-corrosion apparatus has been
assembled for insertion in the LITR, and an LITR-
irradiated stress-corrosion rig is ready for exami-
nation. The creep apparatus inserted in the MTR
has completed six weeks of irradiation and is to
be returned to ORNL for measurements. A theo-
retical study has been completed which indicates
that xenon will be sparged from the ART, as
presently designed, in sufficient quantity to
alleviate the control problem.

contained 2 mole % UF, and in the other capsule
the fluoride mixture contained 2 mole % UF ,. A
control capsule for each mixture was also opened
and analyzed. No corrosion could be found in any
of these five capsules. One irradiated capsule
containing UF, that was examined earlier had
shown slight corrosion. The next series of capsules
that will become available for analysis consists
of four capsules that will have been irradiated
three times as long (six weeks) as those analyzed
thus far. The capsules in this series will be more
likely to reveal any difference that might exist
between the two fuel materials.

The starting fuel mixtures were analyzed? for
trivalent uranium, total uranium, iron, chromium,
nickel, sodium, and zirconium. The UF ;-bearing
batch had more than 96% of its uranium in the
trivalent condition, whereas no trivalent uranium
was found in the UF -bearing batch when analyzed
by a method which is sensitive to 0.005% us.
The results of the chemicol analyses for uranium,
iron, chromium, and nickel in the starting mixture,
the control mixtures, and the irradiated mixtures
were averaged, and ratios were computed to deter-
mine whether there were changes in distribution
or composition. The results of these statistical
analyses, which are presented in Table 8.1,
indicate that there was no significant uranium
segregation and that there were no changes in
concentration of uranium, iron, chromium, and
nickel.

Chemical analyses were also obtained of four
additional irradiated Inconel capsules in which the
fluoride fuel mixture initially contained 4 mole %

....UF,. The uranium analyses of inner cores and

outer cores of the samples agreed to within 6%.
The iron, chromium, and nickel concentrations
were between 0.01 and 0.1%. Additional capsules
this type are being prepared for irradiation in

‘MTR at 1500°F, for control runs, and for

thermal cycling tests.

R. M. Carroll W. W. Parkinson

Solid State Division

The operation of the loop for circulating fluoride-
base fuel in the LITR horizontal beam hole to
study the effect of reactor irradiation on corrosion
and fuel stability was described in the previous
report.’ The fuel mixture was composed of 62.5
mole % NaF, 12.5 mole % ZrF ,, and 25 mole % UF,.
The loop was cleaned by running it at 1500°F for
16 hr with a non-uranium-bearing salt. The actual
fuel mixture was circulated in the loop for 645 hr,
including 475 hr during which the LITR was at
full power (3000 kw). The power generated in the
loop swas about 2.8 kw, and the linear flow rate of
the fuel mixfure was 8 to 10 fps, which corresponds

to a Reynolds number of 5000 to 6500. The dis-

assembly of the loop to provide specimens for
metallurgical examination and chemical analysis
and to reduce the loop to pieces of convenient
size for fuel recovery has been completed.

After operation of the loop in the LITR, the
section between the linear seal flange and the

pump was sheared with remotely controlled equip-

ment to permit removal of the pump in its shield.

The loop in its water jacket was then transported
to the hot cells of the Solid State Division for the
remote disassembly operation. The out-of-pile end’

of the jacket was drawn from the withdrawal shield

through a hole in the rear wall of a hot cell equipped

“with the special disassembly apparatus show

insulation, heaters, wires, and graphite shield
blocks. The loop is shown partially stripped in
Fig. 8.3, as photographed through a window of the
hot cell.

Tube sections about 2 in. long were cut from the
fuel tubes for metallographic specimens. These
specimens were taken at about 6-in. intervals from
the part outside the jacket seal flange and at 2-ft
intervals inside the flange, between the heat ex-
changer “and the irradiated section. Additional
specimens were taken from the heat exchanger and
the venturi for examination of a longitudinal
section. The U bend of the irradiated section was
cut into five specimens from Y to 1 in. long, and
additional specimens were cut from the remaining
18 in. of the irradiated section at about 6-in.
intervals. The fuel was removed from these
specimens by melting in an argon atmosphere.
Four 2-in. sections of tube were also taken from
the portion of the loop between the jacket flange
and the pump, and two more were taken 6 in. back
from the ‘irradiated section to furnish samples for
chemical analysis of the fuel.

Disassembly of the pump was complicated by
its size and by the large stainless steel enclosure
around the bowl (Fig. 8.4). A 300-amp, d-¢ welder
equipped with a high-frequency-arc starter was
used to cut the enclosure successfully. It was

. possible to guide the cutting electrode with a
“manipulator while cutting the sheet metal in a

manner that prevented contamination of the fuel
system with nonradioactive material. After the

. pump enclosure was removed, the insulation and
~ the various wires and heaters were taken off to
provide access to the pump bow! and the fuel

tubes, A he fuel tubes were severed and the

of the activity, and, since an analysis of the
condition of bearing and seals was precluded,
this portion of the pump was discarded. The fuel-
containing parts were stored for uranium recovery.

The metallurgical specimens have been prepared
and photomicrographed. A preliminary analysis
indicates that subsurface void formation was
generally uniform throughout the loop to a depth of
0.8 mil. The uniformity of attack possibly resulted
from the lack of a ‘temperature differential in the
loop. The temperature record shows that the fuel
temperature could not have been more than 20°F
lower in the out-of-pile parts of the loop than in
the in-pile parts. Some sections showed grain
growth, which is an indication that some tempera-
tures were higher than those recorded, but even
the areas of grain growth showed no significant

change i in depth of corrosion.

power density of 0.5 to 0.6 kw/em3. The power
density gives a measure of the severity of con-
ditions imposed upon at least one section of the
loop tubing by radiation effects. No difference in
the corrosion could be observed between this
region and other, less severely irradiated, regions.
Also, about the same depth of attack was found in

the venturi section of the loop as was present in

the rest of the loop, even though there was a large
velocity gradient present. No intergranular attack
was noted.

analysis were sampled by a drilling method de-
scribed previously.® After the end of a tube section

the loop. The mockup was designed to duplicate
both the ‘&rrangement of structural materials and
the macroscopic cross section of the fuel so that
effective thermal-neutron flux values could be
measured inside the fuel and then could be used
to calculate the power generated by fissioning.
The results are being compared with the activation
of cobalt monitor foils attached to the loop and
with additional data from the activation of borings

for the sample taken upstream was 5.33, and that
for the sample taken downstream was 8.07. Within

After a delay of 53 days, the two pipe samples
were re-examined to determine the apparent half
lives of the two components of the gamma-ray
spectrum. For the Rul93 peak (0.50 Mev), the
half lives of two samples were 42 and 43 days,
respectively, and amply confirmed the assignment
of that activity. For the Zr95-Nb?5 peak, however,
the results were 40 and 43 days, respectively,
instead of the nearly 65 days expected. The
contribution to this gamma-ray energy (0.78 Mev)
must be largely from 37-day Nb%3, the 65-day Zr%>
being very low in relative amount (a few per cent).
It appears very likely that niobium deposits on the
Inconel pipes along with ruthenium. The deposition
rate for Nb%5 cannot be estimated, at present, since
it is produced very slowly from its Zr?5 parent,
rather than rapidly from fission as is the case
with Ru 103,

Radiochemical analysis of a fuel sample for
Ru'®% indicated that the amount was below the

168

limit of detection by that technique.® This demon-
strates that the efficiency of ruthenium removal
was comparable to that attained in the ARE.” No
direct neutron activation of the elements of Inconel
was observed.

DELAY OF FISSION GASES BY
CHARCOAL TRAPS

D. E. Guss, United States Air Force
-W. R. Willis, Solid State Division

In the event of a leak in the miniature in-pile
loop mentioned above, the fission gases released
into the cooling-air stream must be contained, and
at the same time, the cooling air must continue to
flow until the temperature of the system has fallen
below the control set point. To accomplish this,
two traps, 24 in. long and 10 in. in diameter, filled
with 6-14 mesh activated cocoanut charcoal, have
been incorporated in the cooling-air off-gas line.
These traps, which are connected in series and
operate at room femperature, can be expected to
hold krypton activity in the system at the design
air flow rate of 20 cfm for 30 sec before the release
of appreciable activity. If the cooling air then
continued to flow at the design rate, the krypton
activity, which would be released over a period of
about 5 min, would reach a peak in about 2 min.
However, since the air flow would stop in less
than 1 min after a leak occurred, virtually all the
krypton activity would be contained in the traps
and would trickle out over a long period of time.
Xenon, the other active gas present in quantity,
will be held back for a much longer period of time;
hence, the trap design was based on the krypton
holdup time.

Since the action of the charcoal is to increase
the effective volume of the trap space by a factor
which depends directly upon the amount of charcoal
used, it was possible to estimate “the trap ‘size

CREEP AND STRESS-CORROSION TESTS
W. E. Davis J. C. Wilson

Solid State Division
Heat transfer experiments have shown that heat
dissipation in the longitudinally finned, vertical

cylinders in the water-jacketed, helium-filied
enclosure of the tube-burst, stress-corrosion appa-
ratus, as presently designed, will limit the
fluoride salt power densities to about 500 w/cm®.
Therefore fins have been added between the salt
container and a surrounding water jacket, and the
heat transfer has been increased sufficiently to
permit operation at power densities greater than
1000 w/cm3. The first complete apparatus has
been assembled and awaits filling before irradi-
ation in the LITR. Five more rigs are being
fabricated. - ;
Tests are under way to determine the suitability
of pressure-regulating valves for supplying gas to
stress the tube-burst specimen. Two pressure-
volume transformers with 1:1 and 6:1 ratios were
designed and are being fabricated. These units
are intended to isolate from the remainder of the

assumed to assure thorough mixing within each

experience indicates a value of about 20 min for
that reactor. It is to be expected that the value
for the ART will be considerably smaller.

A study of the poisoning behavior of the ART was
made for two different types of shutdown. In each
case, it was assumed that 7, = 5 min and that
ve = 1000 STP liters/day. At steady state during
full nuclear power operation, the Xe'3® poisoning
would be about 0.40%. If the nuclear power was
reduced to zero but sparging was continued, the
poisoning would not rise by more than 1 or 2% of
the steady-state value before starting to decrease.
If sparging was discontinued, the poisoning would
rise in about 11 hr to a maximum value of about
12%. If at this point sparging was resumed, about
36 min would be required to reduce the poisoning to
below the steady-state value. Intermediate values
of 10, 5, 2, and 1% poisoning would be reached in
times of about 1, 7, 17, and 25 min, respectively.
It appears highly probable that no difficulties will
be encountered from Xe'3® during short shutdowns,
since removal of the xenon to acceptable levels by
sparging can be made within the time necessary to
force the fuel from the dump tanks into the reactor.

A series of calculations has been performed on
the Oracle to study the approach of the Xe!35
poisoning to its steady-state value. In all cases
of practical interest, this approach is controlled
by the rate of 1135 production. In fact, except for
a change in ordinate, the poisoning is found to
follow the iodine growth curve.

It is concluded that the removal of Xe!3% by
sparging with helium (or other inert gas) appears
to be a satisfactory means of controlling poisoning
in the ART. No difficulties seem to exist in
connection with shutdown behavior of the poisoning
at the sparging rates selected for ART operation.

Modifications of the method for the determination
of uranium metal in fluoride-base reactor fuels
were completed. Further studies were made on the
evaluation of the methylene-blue method for the
determination of trivalent uranium in fluoride-base
reactor fuels. Investigations were continued on
methods for the determination of oxygen as metallic
oxides in fluoride salts. An improved separation
method involving anion-exchange resins was de-
veloped for the determination of alkali metals in
fluoride salts. A volumetric method for the deter-
mination of zirconium in fluoride-base fuels was
proposed. oo

collected in the cold trap, and, after the oxygen
has been removed by evacuation, the water is
allowed to expand into a system of known volume.
The pressure of the water vapor is measured on
a closed-end mercury-sealed oil manometer similar
to that described by Naughton and Frodyma.? The
pressure registered on the manometer is related to
the weight of the uranium present in the sample by
empirical calibration of the apparatus.

A preliminary calibration of the apparatus with
BaCl,-2H,0 as. a standard for hydrogen in the form
of water indicated a linear relationship between
scale reading and weight of hydrogen for the range
0.18 to 0.8 mg of hydrogen. This linear relation-
ship does not apply to larger amounts of hydrogen
because the pressure in the system is approxi-
mately equal to the vapor pressure of water,
Results which have been obtained for the cali-
bration of the apparatus with samples of pure
uranium metal are in agreement with the BaCl,-2H,0
calibration, and they indicate that a scale reading
of 1 mm represents 0.36mg of uranium (Fig. 9.2).
The results of the calibration with uranium metal
have a coefficient of variation of 7% for the range
6 to 60 mg of uranium.

successively nearer the wall of the reaction tube.
Samples of UF, and fluoride salt mixtures which
were to be analyzed for uranium metal were ground
in an atmosphere of hydrogen to prevent oxidation
of the uranium metal. The samples, along with the
necessary equipment for grinding, were placed in
a plastic bag, which could be alternately evacu-
ated and filled with hydrogen. The samples were
ground to a particle size that would pass a
standard 325-mesh sieve.

Several samples of UF; which had been produced
by the reduction of UF, with uranium metal have
been analyzed for uranium metal in the new appa-
ratus. The results for the uranium metal content
paralleled those obtained by petrographic analysis
of the material. The standard deviation for dupli-
cate determinations on the samples of UF, was
approximately the same as that obtained for the
calibration of the apparatus with uranium metal.

The difficulties encountered earlier in the decom-
position of the UH, in certain gaseous atmos-
pheres 3 have been completely eliminated in the
present method. The period of several hours which
was required for the decomposition of the hydride
in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide was reduced to
approximately 20 min when the ignition was carried
out in an atmosphere of oxygen. Tests indicate
that no interference is introduced by the presence
of fluoride salts or trivalent uranium in the
samples, and therefore the procedure should be
applicable to analyses of all types of fluoride
fuels. A topical report on this investigation is
being written.

completed. Portions of eutectic mixtures, which
had been pulverized and sampled under inert atmos-
vheres, were analyzed simultaneously by both
methods in an effort to minimize the effects of the
heterogeneity and the instability of such samples.
An evaluation of the results showed that satis-
factory agreement, comparable to that reported
previously? for other eutectic mixtures, was
achieved in the analytical results for samples of
LiF-BeF,, NaF-LiF, and NaF-BeF,. The results
obtained by the methylene-blue method in the
determination of trivalent uranium in KF-UF ,-UF,
eutectics continue to exhibit negative bias when
compared with the results from the hydrogen-
evolution method. No further studies were made of
NaF-ZrF -UF, eutectics. All the mixtures studied
could be dissolved in methylene-blue solutions
that were 1.5 to 6 M in HCI and saturated with
AICI. No hydrogen is evolved during the dis-
solution of the most reactive trivalent uranium
compounds, such as uct, in 1.5 to 3 M HCI
solutions of methylene blue if efficient agitation
is maintained while the solvent is being added
to the flask.

Methylene-blue solutions that are 1.5 to 6 M in
HCl are reduced, during dissolution at room
temperature, to methylene white by finely divided
metallic chromium, nickel, iron, and uranium-nickel
alloy. Zirconium is only very slightly soluble in
such solutions over a 2-hr period. The presence
of metallic impurities in fluoride-base fuels causes
highly erratic results when trivalent uranium is
determined by the methylene-blue method, but such
impurities have an even greater adverse effect on
the hydrogen-evolution method. Dissolution of the
metallic impurities in the hot acid solvent results
in quantitative evolution of hydrogen. A more
comprehensive description of the theoretical and
practical aspects of the methylene-blue method for
determining trivalent uranium will be issued in the
form of a topical report.

Simultaneous Determination of Trivalent Uranium
and Total Uranium

The inherent advantage of the methylene-blue
method over the hydrogen-evolution method, that
is, the possibility of determining trivalent uranium
and total uranium in the same sample, is still being
investigated. The studies have led to the postu-
lation of an interaction species of pentavalent
uranium and methylene white. A detailed study

176

of this postulation has been initiated. The method
of Vosburgh and Cooper® will be applied to es-
tablish the stoichiometry of the complex. Attempts
to prepare standard solutions of methylene white
through the reduction of methylene blue by zinc
amalgam have been unsuccessful because of the
ease with which zinc ions react with both the
oxidized and reduced forms of methylene blue. An

attempt is being made to prepare pure methylene

white through electrolytic reduction of methylene
blue.

DETERMINATION OF LITHIUM IN
LiF-BeF, AND LiF-ZsF -UF

A. S. Meyer, Jr. D. L. Manning
Analytical Chemistry Division

A method for the determination of lithium in
LiF-BeF, and LiF-ZrF ,-UF, has been developed
that is based on a separation of lithium by an
anion-exchange resin, Dowex-1. In this procedure
a sulfate solution of the fluorides that is approxi-
mately 1 N with respect to H,50, is passed
through a column of Dowex-1 in the hydroxide form.
In order to avoid the depletion of the resin in the
column by the H,S0,, the solution is equilibrated
with about 20 ml of a water slurry of the resin in
the hydroxide form in a beaker before being placed
onto the column. Beryllium, uranium, and zirconium
are retained on the column as the beryllate,
zirconate, and diuranate anion, respectively,
while the lithium passes into the effluent as LiOH.
The following equations represent the probable
reactions, where ROH is the hydroxide form of the
anion-exchange resin:

H,SO, + 2ROH  —> R,S0, + 2H,0

Zr(S0,), + 8ROH —> R,Zt0,, + 2R,S0, + 4H,0
BeSO, + 4ROH  —> R,Be0, + R,SO, + 2H,0
200,80, + 6ROH—> R,U,0, + 2R,S0, + 3H,0
Li,50, + 2ROH —> R,SO, + 2LiOH

It may be seen from the equations that LiOH and
water are the only species which are found in the
effluent. The lithium is determined by titrating
the hydroxide with a solution of standard HCI.

if the fluoride mixtures contain sodium fluoride
in addition to lithium fluoride, the sodium will

react in the same manner as the lithium and will

be found in the effluent as NaOH. A subsequent
titration of the effluent with standard HCI will give
the sum of sodium and lithium as the hydroxides.
Lithium is then determined by extracting the LiCl,
after titration with HCI, with 2-ethyl- 1-hexanol and
titrating the chloride ion in the nonaqueous medium
according to the procedure developed by White
and Goldberg.”

If a single alkali metal is present in the fluoride
mixture, it can be determined directly by titration
of the effluent with standard HCI. When more than
one alkali metal is present, the sum of the atkali-
metal hydroxide concentration in the effluent is
obtained by the method just described. Lithium is
then determined by the 2-ethyi- I-hexanol procedure;’
potassium, by the tetraphenyl boron gravimetric
method;® and sodium, by the difference.

Williams and Vaughan (cf. *‘ANP Service Labo-
ratory’’) have utilized a two-stage anion-exchange
resin column for the determination of the alkali
metal fluorides in the presence of beryllium,
zirconium, and uranium fluorides. The first column
contains the anion-exchange resin, Dowex-1, in
the citrate form, whereas the second column
contains the resin in the hydroxide form. Beryl-
ium, zirconium, and uranium remain in the citrate
column as the anionic citrate complexes, and the
alkali metals pass into the effluent as the alkali
metal hydroxides. The alkali metal concentration
is then determined by titrating the effluent with
standard HCI.

In the method described above, a single column
of anion-exchange resin in the hydroxide form is
used, and thus the need for the citrate form of the

"anion-exchange resin is completely eliminated.
~The method has. been tested in the aboratory and

complex with zirconium in acidic solutions. The
excess EDTA is then back-titrated with bismuth
nitrate; thiourea is used as the indicator. The end
point is noted by the formation of the yellow
bismuth-thiourea complex. An advantage of this
method in comparison with previous methods for
using EDTA in the determination of zirconium is
that anions which form complexes with zirconium,
such as fluoride, sulfate, phosphate, thiocyanate,
and tartrate, do not interfere,

This volumetric method for the zirconium determi-
nation appeared to have several advantages over
the gravimetric mandelic acid method now being
used, but it was found that the yellow thiourea end
point was obscure, especially in the presence of
hexavalent uranium, which is also yellow. The
precision was consequently poor.

The possibility of modifying the method by back-
titrating the excess EDTA with a solution of
iron{l11}, with disodium- 1, 2-dihydroxybenzene-3, 5-di-
sulfonate (Tiron) as the indicator, is now being
investigated. This reagent forms an intensely
purple complex with iron(It}) in an acetate-buffered
solution having a pH of about 5.0. Two moles of
Tiron combine with 1 mole of iron under these
conditions. This complex, which has a pK of about
10, is relatively stable.

The pK of the iron-EDTA complex’ is about 25,
which is approximately the same as that of the
zirconium-EDTA complex. It is possible, therefore,
to add a solution of iron{lll} to a solution of EDTA
and Tiron at a pH of 5,0 so that when the EDTA is
completely complexed the color of the solution will
change from yellow to purple. Qualitative, pre-
liminary tests revealed this change in color at the

“end point to be well defined. The end point was
“very sharp when a solution of 0.05 M EDTA
“containing about 50 mg of Tiron was titrated with a
“solution of 0.05 M iron(lli}. The end point corre-

DETERMINATION OF OXYGEN IN
FLUORIDE FUELS

A. S. Meyer, Jr. J. M. Peele
Analytical Chemistry Division

Further tests were carried out on the determi-
nation of oxygen as oxide in fluoride fuels! by
electrolysis of solutions of the samples in fused
KHF,. Quantities of oxygen in excess of 90% of
the theoretical value were recovered when known
amounts of oxygen were introduced as water by the
addition of samples of Na,CO,, which react with
the fused bifluoride i in accordance with the following
equation:

Na,CO, + 2KHF ,—> 2NaF + 2KF + H,0 + CO,

The yields were not quantitative, because the rate
of oxygen evolution decreased as the concentration
of water in the electrolyte was reduced. Since
traces of hydrogen were detected in the insoluble
gases, even though a high concentration of AgF
was added to the electrolyte, methods were adapted
for the direct determination of oxygen in the
effluent gases.

For samples containing large quantities of
oxygen the Orsat'? method for the determination
of oxygen in gases was applied by passing the
insoluble gas, which was collected over KOH,
into a solution of alkaline pyrogallate and meas-
uring the decrease in volume of the gas.

A modification of the Winkler method 3 for the
determination of oxygen in water was adapted for
samples which contained smaller concentrations
of oxygen. The apparatus was modified by con-
verting the sweep gas to purified helium and
bubbling the effluent cell gases directly into an
alkaline solution which contained Kl and a sus-
pension of Mn(OH), in which the oxygen was

absorbed according to the reaction
4Mn(OH), + O, + 2H,0—> 4Mn(OH),

The absorbed oxygen was determined by acidi-
fying the absorber solution and thus liberating an
equivalent quantity of iodine, which was then
titrated with standard Na,S,0, solution. If only
microgram quantities of oxygen are present, the
iodine is measured by extracting it into orthoxylene
and determining the concentration of iodine in the
organic phase spectrophotometrically according to
the procedure of Silverman, Bradshaw, and Taylor. 14
Experiments are now being carried out in an attempt
to reduce the time required for the quantitative
evolution of oxygen. No significant increase in
the rate of oxygen generation was obtained by
carrying out the electrolysis at a temperature of
250°C rather than at 100°C. The effect of the
design and current density of the anode on the
efficiency of the generation of oxygen is now being
studied. It has been found that the use of a
mercury cathode, which is introduced by placing
a Teflon cup in the electrolytic cell, simplifies
the electrolysis. Fluctuations of the current are
decreased, and the evolution of fluorine is greatly
reduced. By introducing the sweep gas below the
surface of the mercury, the problem of slugging of
the entrance line is eliminated. Since AgF is
incompatible with mercury under these conditions,
it cannot be used to reduce the rate of generation
of hydrogen.

Extension of the method of Codell and Norwitz '®
for the determination of oxygen in titanium to the
determination in fluoride-base fuels was continued
during this period. Several modifications of the

addition, an ice-salt trap was placed between the
ignition tube and the first dry-ice~alcohol trap to

remove more completely the excess bromine vapor.
It was found that if the flow rate of the mixture of
helium ond bromine vapor were too rapid, the
second dry-ice—alcohol trap became plugged with
solid bromine during the course of a determination.

In the previous application of the bromination
method to the determination of oxygen in BeO,
considerable oxide contamination was found in the
NaF- FeF; flux that was used. A small quantity of
the impure flux was therefore treated with bromine
vapor at 750°C, and then the pretreated flux was
used in the determination. Essentially complete

bromine vapor at 950°C. )

Several samples of Cr, were analyzed for oxide
contamination, and reasonable values were found
when the samples were treated with bromine vapor
at 950°C. The accuracy and optimum conditions
for this determination will be investigated with
known mixtures of CrF, and Cr,0O

Also, several samples of Na, ZF were analyzed
for oxide contamination. The bromination was
performed at 950°C, and reasonable values of
oxygen contamination were found. During the
analysis of two samples of Li ZrF,, a precipitate
formed on the surface of the Ba(OH),, bubbler and
caused inefficient flow of gas through the appa-
ratus. It is believed that the occurrence of this
precipitate was due to a reaction involving the
hydrogen fluoride or fluorine which was present or
was formed in the samples being analyzed. A trap
of NaF and KBr is being prepared for removal of
these gases. The accuracy and optimum conditions
for the determination of oxygen contamination in
ZF, will then be investigated.

It was impossible to secure reasonable blanks in
the absence of BeO, and furthermore, when BeO
was present, no evidence of stoichiometry was
found. In these attempts, samples of BeO and
BeF,-BeO were placed in contact with solutions
of KF, as concentrated as 20% (W/V), at tempera-
tures of 80°C. The concentration of hydroxyl ions
presumed to have been formed during the dissolution
of the sample was then determined by titration with
standard acid. Values from 7.5 to 9.0 pH units
were chosen as arbitrary end points for these
titrations. Dissolution of either BeO or BeF, (with
oxide contamination) was more rapid in higher
concentrations of KF and at pH values of 7.5. A
fine crystalline precipitate was formed during the
dissolution of all samples containing BeF,. From
the results of x-ray diffraction analysis, it was
found that this precipitate contained K,BeF ,.

DETERMINATION OF TRACE AMOUNTS OF
NICKEL IN FLUORIDE FUELS WITH
SODIUM DIETHYLDITHIOCARBAMATE

J. P. Young M. A. Marler
Analytical Chemistry Division

The use of sodium diethyldithiocarbamate in the
colorimetric determination of nickel in trace
amounts was investigated. The work of Chilton'’
served as a basis for these studies.

Sodium diethyldithiocarbamate is a very sensitive
colorimetric reagent for nickel; however, this re-
agent forms colored complexes with a wide variety
of cations. Many of the metal complexes of sodium
diethyldithiocarbamate are extractible into organic
solvents.

-With the addition of the complexing agents de-
scribed by Chilton, it was found that the inter-
“ference of uranium was still present, although
somewhat decreased. Of the other ions present in
fluoride-base fuels, chromium and the alkali ions
presented no interference, and evidence indicates
that zirconium does not interfere.  Absorbancy

ANP SERVICE LABORATORY

W. F. Vaughan C. R. Williams
Analytical Chemistry Division

The number of determinations of the oxygen
content of metallic sodium increased sharply during
the quarter. Efforts are being made to increase
the accuracy of this determination, and two steps
have been taken to achieve this goal. More ef-
ficient removal of the thin film of adsorbed moisture
on the outer surface of the glass bulbs used for
the determination is being achieved by immersing
the bulbs in acetone and then quickly rinsing them
in dry ether before placing them in the hexane-butyl
bromide mixture. Also, the reagents, both hexane
and butyl bromide, are being desiccated over
phosphorus pentoxide so that the water content is
less than 5 ppm.

The major portion of the work in the service
laboratory continued to be the analysis of fluoride
salts, with the emphasis being on the determination

180

of the following components: Na, Zr, Li, K, F,
us, total U, Ni, Cr, Fe, and Mo. A new procedure
for the determination of lithium was proposed and
tested in which lithium and other alkali metals
are first separated from zirconium, beryllium,
uranium, and sulfate ions by means of two anion-
exchange resin columns in series. The first column
is prepared in the citrate form and the second in
the hydroxide form, The effluent from the second
column is a solution of lithium or alkali metal
hydroxides, the concentration of which is deter-
mined by titration with standard acid. Work by
Manning (cf. “‘Determination of Lithium in LiF-
BeF, and LiF-ZrF,-UF,”) has subsequently
shown that only the hydroxide form of the anion
resin is required for the separation.

A total of 1673 samples was analyzed, on which
8678 determinations were made. The backlog
consists of 151 samples. A breakdown of the work
is given in Table 9.1.

PILOT PLANT DESIGN

The design of the pilot plant for recovering ANP
fuel by a fused salt—fluoride volatility process
is expected to be completed by August 15. The
engineering flowsheet is 85% complete. Of the
29 pieces of process equipment now contemplated,
10 are completely designed or specified and on
order; 2 of the 10 have been received. The
scheduled construction completion date is still
December 31, 1955.

The plant will be located in cells 1 and 2 of
Building 3019. Equipment for highly radioactive
materials — the fluorinator, the ARE fuel dump
tank, and the vessel for melting other salts to be
processed (for example, salts from the in-pile
loops) — will be in cell 1. Equipment for less
radicactive materials will be in cell 2, The
remainder of the equipment will be in the operating
gallery and on the roof above cells 1 and 2.

The present plan of operation is to lower the
ARE dump tank into the cell, melt the contents,
and pass the molten salt into the fluorinator by
means of nitrogen pressure. The process differs
from that ‘previously described! in the following

Two refrigeration units, each consisting of a
Freon F-22 and F-13 cascade system, will be used
to chill Freon F-11 to —40 and -62°C for recircu-
lation through the cold traps.

PROCESS DEVELOPMENT

In further studies on an absorption bed for

removing volatile radioactive material from the

UF -F, gas stream of the fused salt-volatility
process, sodium fluoride was found to be much
more effective than calcium fluoride.  Decon-
tamination was poor in second runs with the same
absorbent bed. It is believed that the temperature
of the bed is important, but control of the bed
temperature was difficult.

The absorbent beds were 1-in,-dia tubes that
contained 90 g of either calcium fluoride or sodium
fluoride in a 9-in. length or 180 g in an 18-in.
length. The CaF, used was made by fluorinating
CaSO,. Both the CaF, and the NaF were 12 to
40 mesh. The gas from a fluorinator was passed
directly into the absorbent bed. The flucrination

‘reaction was carried out with 365-g charges of the

ARE-type fuel NaF-ZrF, UF, (53.5-43.0-3.5

mole %) containing 30 g of uranium, Previous

“work? had been done with similar material on a

scale of a 67-g charge of fuel.
“ The NaF was ten times as effective as reported

‘previously. The amount of fluorine used for the
fluorination ‘was much

Calcium fluoride at either 200 or 650°C was
about one-third as effective as NaF in removing
volatile ruthenium and niobium fluoride from the
UF -F, gas stream. Tests were made with both
9- and 18-in.-long beds (Tables 10.1, 10.2, and
10.3).

Good decontamination was obtained with NaF
in either a 9- or an 18-in.-long bed at 650°C when
the NaF/U weight ratio was 3/1 (Table 10.1, runs
1, 2, 3) or 6/1 (Table 10.2, runs 5 and 7). When
the 9-in.-long bed was re-used (run 4, Table 10.1),
so that the over-all NaF /U weight ratio was 1.5/1
for the two runs, decontamination factors for gross
beta, gross gamma, and ruthenium beta decreased
sharply. With the 18-in.-long bed the same effect
was observed, although here the over-all NaF/U
weight ratio for the two runs was 3/1 (Table 10.2,
runs 6 and 8).

difficult to maintain at 650°C. The temperature
profile over the 18-in.-long bed varied 90°C. The
data in Table 10.2 were obtained with the hottest
point at 670°C; this temperature may be a little
high for efficient operation, but operation at a
lower temperature would probably result in too
much uranium retention in the cooler section,

CORROSION STUDIES

in 20 laboratory-scale fluorination runs at 650°C,
corrosion of nickel test coupons and of the nickel
reaction vessel was fairly low. Since conditions
changed continually during the runs and since the
various components of the vessel were attacked
to different degrees, a calculated over-all cor-
rosion rate would have no significance, However,
it appears that a large number of ARE fuel fluori-
nation runs can be made in one reaction vessel

The temperature of the NaF absorbent bed was before corrosion interferes with the process.

A calculational method has been developed for
tracing all the gamma radiation born within a
circulating-fuel reactor; for this calculation it is
assumed that the reactor is spherically symmetric
and that all regions are homogeneous. In addition,
the codings of two Monte Carlo problems — the
calculation of the heat generation resulting from
the absorption of gamma radiation in laminated
shields and the calculation of the energy and
angular distribution of air-scattered neutrons from
a monoenergetic source - are nearing completion.
The analysis of the constant-velocity transport
equation has also been extended.

GAMMA-RAY DISTRIBUTION IN A
CIRCULATING-FUEL REACTOR AND SHIELD

C. D. Zerby M. D. Pearson’

A semianalytical Monte Carlo calculation has
been initiated to determine the history of all
gamma radiation born within a circulating-fuel
reactor of the ART type. The calculation is a
joint effort of the Boeing Airplane Company and
ORNL and will be coded for the IBM 701 automatic

digital computer. The problems of interest will

be computed at Boeing. ~ The calculation will be

simplified by the” assumptions that the reactor has

spherically symmetric geometry and that the
regions without homogeneity (for example, “the
heat exchanger) are homogeneous. However, these
will be the only simplifications, and all shells of

the core, reflector, ‘and shield, including the

Inconel container shells, will be taken ‘ into

. account, Ce vr

of all gamma radiation born within any one

The

absorption resulting from the transport of the
gamma radiation, These data will be presented as
a function of radius. The results will also include
determinations of the energy spectrum and angular
distribution of the gamma radiation penetrating
the shield. The data obtained will be normalized
per watt of power generated in the core.

The sources of gamma radiation within the core
will be determined from neutron flux distribution
data obtained from one of the existing multigroup
neutron diffusion calculations. The power of the
reactor will be determined from these same data.

The energy and density normalization of the
total prompt-fission .and fission-product decay
gamma rays born in the active fuel region of the
core will be obtained from the relationship

(nn N(E) = 13.7 ¢=1-08E |
where
N(E) = total photons /fission/Mev,

i

E = energy (Mev).
The components of this total are given by the
following equations:

(2) NE) = 7.7 em 1.02E |
BC Ny(E) = 6 e~1-2E |
where -
N,(E) = prompt photons /fission/Mev,

i

N,(E) = decay photons /fission/Mev.
Equation 2 is an empirical fit to published data, ?
while Eq. 3 is a best guess inferred from some

experimental data.® Equation 1 is the sum of

Eqs. 2 and 3. Better data will be used as they
become available.
In the heat exchanger region, only the fission-

product decay gamma rays will be considered,

since the thermal-neutron flux, and thus the
fissioning, is depressed by the boron curtains,
It will be assumed that these decay gamma rays
will be uniformly distributed in the heat exchanger.
The energy and density normalization of this

"radiation will be obtained from Eq. 3. In all

other regions of the core the energy and density
of the capture gamma rays will be determined from
published data.4

The capture gamma-ray sources in the shield
will be included when data on the neutron flux in
this region become available. It is hoped that the
numerical integration of the transport equation for
spherical shields will be completed so that the
results will be available to complete this problem.

A neglected source of radiation is that resulting
from inelastic neutron scattering. However, this
radiation can be included without modification of
the code when the information becomes available.

It is intended that each region of the assembly
be treated separately, and the results will be
added to complete the treatment of the reactor as
a whole. By treating each region separately, it
will be possible to make parameter studies to
determine optimum configurations to shield
against radiation from any particular region.

For this calculation it was necessary to deviate
from the straightforward Monte Carlo methods
because of the many mean free paths of material
to be penetrated by the core-region gamma rays;
for example, there are approximately 16 mean free
paths from the center of the core to the outside of
the shield for 3-Mev gamma rays in a typical
300-Mw design. Many mean free paths of at-
tenuation for radiation usually result in poor
statistics in the solution when the problem is
treated by Monte Carlo methods. It was therefore
necessary to use a semianalytical method, which
is a considerable improvement over the straight-
forward procedure. The procedure is to generate
the spatial energy and angular collision density
of gamma rays born in any one region by standard
Monte Carlo techniques and from this to calculate
analytically the energy spectrum and angular
distribution of the penetrating radiation. The
data on heating are obtained in a similar manner.$
In practice the analytical and Monte Carlo parts of
the problem are carried on simultaneously, each
modifying the other.

ENERGY ABSORPTION RESULTING FROM
GAMMA RADIATION INCIDENT ON A
MULTIREGION SHIELD WITH SLAB GEOMETRY

C. D. Zerby S. Auslender

The coding of a Monte Carlo calculation of heat
generation resulting from the transport gamma
radiation through shields with ' laminated-slab
geometry is nearing completion.” The data re-
sulting from the calculation will include the
energy absorption as a function of depth, as well
as the energy reflected and penetrating the slab.

A revised code makes it possible to consider
the gamma-ray heating in a circulating-fuel reactor
when it is idealized to slab geometry (see pre-
ceding paper). As coded, 1000 histories can be
calculated by the Oracle with standard Monte Carlo
methods in approximately 5 min. This number of
histories should be sufficient to provide good
statistics for gamma rays incident on a shield
with a thickness of approximately seven mean free
paths, The code should be applicable to other
programs as cases of interest arise.

ENERGY AND ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF
AIR-SCATTERED NEUTRONS FROM A
MONOENERGETIC SOURCE

C.D. Zerby

A general description of a Monte Carlo calcu.
lation of the energy and angular distribution of
air-scattered neutrons from a monoenergetic source
was given in a previous report, Coding of the
problem for the Oracle is continuing, and slight
modifications in the original problem have been
made for greater utility. The program now makes
possible a determination of the energy and angular
distribution of air-scattered neutrons from a unit
surface source on the surface of a sphere,

The sphere on which the source is located will be
treated as a black body to radiation returning to
the sphere.

With these modifications it is possible to calcu-
late the answers for several sources having
different powers of the cosine distribution and
then to combine them to duplicate the distribution
from the surface of a circulating-fuel reactor.
Detailed information about the neutron radiation
reaching the crew compartment shield can thus be
obtained.

A study of the effect of neutrons originally
emitted in the half space to the rear of the aircraft
on the total flux at the crew compartment shield
can also be made with these modifications.
Economical shaping of the reactor shield is
dependent on a thorough knowledge of behavior of
this radiation,

ANALYSIS OF THE CONSTANT-VELOCITY
TRANSPORT EQUATION

F. H. Murray

The analysis of the constant-velocity transport
equation previously developed®’'® has been
extended.!! The inversion of the Fourier trans-
forms computed in the first paper may be avoided
by the use of eigenfunctions for all the separate
strata or shells of a stratified medium. The
course of the calculations is the same as for a
system of nonhomogeneous differential equations,
To any solution of the nonhomogeneous equation
is added the sum of all eigenfunctions, each
multiplied by a constant factor, and these factors
are determined by the conditions at the boundaries
between different media. In this case the con-
ditions are that the product (n,0)/(S,v) be con-
tinuous at each surface and that the flux vanish
at infinity for finite sources. The eigenfunctions
for cylindrical and spherical source distributions
may be calculated from those for plane source
distributions with the aid of matrix representations
of rotations in three-dimensional space. The
solution of the transport equation with finite
sources but for unbounded space represents the
solution of the nonhomogeneous equation.

The second series of experiments with mockups
of the circulating-fuel reflector-moderated reactor

(RMR) and shield have been continued at the Lid

"Tank Shielding Facility (LTSF). This series con-

sists of two sets of tests: the static source tests
and the dynamic source tests. The measurements
taken to date have been concerned with the static
source tests. ’

REFLECTOR. MODERATED REACTOR AND
SHIELD MOCKUP TESTS

G. T. Chapman J. B. Dee
: oH. C. Woodsum

Many of the measurements in the static source

 

‘tests of the reflector-moderated reactor and shield

mockup experiment at the LTSF have been com-
pleted. As reported previously, ! these tests were
designed to determine the primary and secondary
sources of radiation that reach the outside of the
shield. The tests completed to date have included
(1) gamma-ray dose rate measurements behind
various configurations of the mockup (the standard
configuration is shown in Fig. 12.1), (2) thermal-
neutron flux distribution measurements within the
beryllium reflector, (3) neutron measurements be-
hind the mockups as a function of the thickness of
the lead gamma-ray shield region, and {4) sodium
activation measurements within the heat exchanger.

Before any mockup tests were performed, a series
of gamma-ray dose rate, fast-neutron dose rate, and
thermal-neutron flux measurements were made both
in plain water and in borated water contained in the
iron tank that holds all the components of the
mockup in the experiment. These measurements
were ‘made in order to determine the effect of the
borated water in which all the mockup measure-
ments are made. The mockup tank, which is placed
against the source plate, has a % in.-thick alumi-
num window onthe source side. Radiation measure-
ments were also made in the plain water of the

LTSF (that is, no mockup tank used).

beryllium and the heat exchanger showed that, for
thicknesses of boral greater than % in., there was
no change in the resulting gamma-ray dose rate
(Fig. 12.4). This simply means that gamma rays
resulting from epithermal neutron capture in the
heat exchanger are not an important contribution
to the total gamma-ray dose rate (see further
discussion on the sodium activation below).
Figure 12.5 shows a decrease in total gamma-ray
dose rate with an increase in heat exchanger
thickness. This decrease was investigated and
was found to be just an attenuation of the primary

flector region. The foils were placed on the faces
of each beryllium slab from 5 in. above the source
center line in intervals of 4 in. to the top of the
beryllium. Plots of the results as a function of
the beryllium thickness (Fig. 12.10) are uniform

Neutron measurements (Fig. 12.12) were also

a function of the boral curtain thickness and the

figurations tested (Fig. 12.13), 12 in. of beryllium
preceded the first boral slab. The last boral slab
behind the heat exchanger region was followed by

pellets of sodium fluoride (p = 2.1 g/cm) in the
center of each heat exchanger tank at the source

the BSR, which was modified with GE-type tran-
sition sections.

One objective of the experiment was to deter.
mine the optimum spacing, if such existed, between
the reactor face and the inlet air duct. Another
objective was to obtain information about the
angular distribution of radiation, particularly fast
neutrons, leaving the reactor shield. The latter
data were needed in order to calculate the scattered
radiation dose arriving at the crew compartment.

The extensive data obtained from the measure-
ments, which included more than 80 traverses, have
not been completely analyzed by ORNL, and it is
contemplated that the remaining work will be done
by the GE group at Lockland. A description of
the experiment and some tentative conclusions are
presented here.

The fuel loading of the BSR was arranged to
correspond as closely as possible to that of the
GE-ANP aircraft reactor. This necessitated the
use of a long, narrow reactor (Fig. 13.1). Tran-
sition sections were mounted on either side of the
reactor (Fig. 13.2) to simulate the two transition
sections of the GE-ANP aircraft engine. The two

duct mockups, labeled ‘‘inlet’”’ and ‘‘outlet,”’ are
shown outside the transition sections. The ducts
were mounted on a large plate (Fig. 13.3), and the
entire assembly was arranged as a‘‘package shield
mockup,’’ the package being lowered as a unit into
the reactor pool, This method was employed be-

“cause the BSF reactor pool is now filled with de-

mineralized water, and refilling the pool after
draining to assemble equipment in it would be very
time-consuming. All materials of construction were
corrosion resistant, being either aluminum or stain-
less steel. The duct mockups were essentially
two-dimensional analogs of the actual three-
dimensional annular ducts. In order to determine
the optimum position of the inlet air duct, the

in this summary in order to provide an illustration
of the data. The first traverse (Fig. 13.4) shows
what happens to the leakage out the end of the large
inlet duct as its position is varied. The detectors
were actually placed on the end of the duct. This
plot shows the counting rates for each of the three
detectors as a function of separation distance bes
tween the inlet and outlet ducts. Since there is
simply a smooth decrease in counting rate as the
separation is increased, there is no evidence of
streaming down the entire length of the duct.
Figure 13.5 shows traverses lengthwise behind
the large air duct as a function of the reactor-duct
spacing. The fast-neutron traverse was made, in
each case, at the same location; only the inter-
vening inlet air duct was moved. For the spacings
shown, there is little difference in the fast-neutron
dose rate along the traverse behind the duct. It
appears that as far as fast neutrons are concerned
the duct simply reduces the density of the shield,

emitters are entrained in the fuel mixture and reach
the heat exchanger very shortly after the corre-
sponding fissions have occurred. The energy
spectrum of these short-lived fission-product gamma

rays has not been measured, and, since most of the
‘gamma-ray energy is given off with short periods,

a complete lack of knowledge of this important
spectrum now exists. All estimates? which have

"been mode of the spectral shape must be con-
sidered tobe quite unreliable, and even the average
‘gamma-ray energy release is in some doubt. lt is

felt that this lack of spectral information for decay
gamma rays could cause an error of a few thousand
pounds in the supposedly optimized shield weight,

three experiments will make use of the multiple-
crystal gamma-ray spectrometer, which allows

‘measurements of continuous gamma-ray spectra to
“be analyzed with reasonable certainty.

LTSF and will make use of the RMR mockup (see

Sec. 12). In this test the circulating-fuel belt will

be placed near the LTSF source plate, and the
spectrometer will be exposed to gamma radiation
from the belt. Thus the spectrometer will measure
the gamma-ray spectrum that would be encountered
from a heat exchanger operating with the same type
of circulating-fuel parameters. These results should
shed some light upon the accuracy of the more
general experiments described below.

The other two experiments will be based upon
the brief bombardment of small samples of enriched
U238 jn the interior of the ORNL Graphite Reactor,
These samples will be handled with the aid of the
fast pneumatic probe assembly available there.
One experiment will involve the measurement of
the disintegration rate of the sample for only a few
energy groups. In this case many points in time
will be studied for each energy group. The other
experiment will be similar except that many energy
groups will be studied for only a few different times
after bombardment. lt should be possible to analyze
the results of these latter experiments in such a
way that the observed spectrum from the heat ex
changer of an aircraft reactor could be derived for
any set of circulation parameters. Times after
fission as short as a few tenths of a second will be
studied in the above experiments. Preliminary re-
sults should be available during the next quarter.

A major portion of the experimental results
necessary for the optimization of the neutron
shielding in a divided shield has been obtained at

~ the Tower Shielding Facility (TSF). These results

concern the fast-neutron dose rate distribution in
the detector tank and in a crew shield mockup as a
function of a variation in the reactor shield geometry
and are identified as Phase | of the differential
experiment. A technique has been devised for pre-
dicting the dose in an arbitrary shield design from
the differential experiment information as the first
sfep in obtaining a procedure for optimizing a
shield design. The technique has been applied to
previous mockup experiments, and the results agree
to within experimental error.

THE DIFFERENTIAL SHIELDING
EXPERIMENTS AT THE TSF: PHASE I

F. N. Watson

The optimization -of the neutron shielding
necessary in a nuclear-powered aircraft depends
primarily upon the variation of the fast-neutron
dose rate in the crew compartment with changes in
such variables as reactor shield thickness, angle
of radiation emission, and thickness of crew com-
ents of the fast-

A complete de n of the TSF detector tank and

to study the penetration to be expected in the side
of a crew shield as related to the angle of neutron
emission from the reactor tank (Figs. 14.2, 14.3,
and 14.4). As a cross check, the fast-neutron dose
rates were measured with the detector held station-
ary successively at the right side, left side, and
bottom of the tank and with the angle of radiation
emission, 6, being changed in steps from 360 to

© 180 deg (Fig. 14.5).

Studies were also made of the penetration into
the front and rear of the detector tank for various
values of @ (Figs. 14.6 and 14,7). Figure 14.8
shows a cross check measured directly as a
function of 6,

Measurements were made of the direct beam
reaching the rear of the detector tank for three
values of reactor shield thickness, p. When these
measurements were plotted as functions of the
total water thickness, that is, y plus p, it was

"found that the flux was a unique function of this

sum. This indicates that the boration of the water
made no difference in the dose for this configuration

(Fig. 14.9).

Measurements in the GE-ANP Crew Compartment

The fast-neutron dose rate distribution within the
crew compartment (Fig. 14.10) of the GE-ANP

* divided shield was also determined. The crew
“¢ormpartment shielding consisted primarily of water
“containing approximately 0.65 wt % boron and lead,

The dose rate measurements, along the y axis

(fore and aft) of the crew compartment (Fig. 14.11)

to the ‘total dose inside the shield, For 0 =270 and

_ quite small.

 
 

 

Measurements from “the lef to the right of the

dose rate is symmetrical for 6 = 0 = 360 deg. The
curve for § = 270 deg shows the effect of most of
the neutrons entering the right side. Because of

a low counting rate, only one point was obtained
for 0 = 180 deg.

The dose rates at the center of the crew com-
partment were measured as a function of 6 for two

‘thicknesses (p) of water shielding the reactor. The

shapes of the two curves, p = 17 and 45 cm, are
roughly the same (Fig. 14,13).

The dose rate at the center of the crew com-
partment as a function of p was also investigated
for various values of @ (Fig. 14.14). By observing
that the relaxation lengths of the curves are slowly
varying, it can be seen that either the angular dis-
tribution of the flux from the reactor tank or its
spectrum is changing.

ANALYSIS OF THE DIFFERENTIAL
SHIELDING EXPERIMENTS

M. F. Valerino

An idealized configuration of an aircraft divided
shield is illustrated in Fig. 14,15. The fast-neutron
dose rate in the crew compartment can be considered
to be a weighted integration of the dose rate radiated
into the air from the primary reactor shield surface.
The weighting factors for this integration must
account for the probability of the air scattering of
the neutrons into the various sides of the crew
shield and for the probability of neutron penetration
through the crew shield into the crew compartment.

The primary purpose of the fast-neutron differential
shielding experiments (reported above) was to ob-
tain these weighting factors as a function of the
angle 6 which a fast-neutron beam from the reactor
shield surface makes with respect to the axis
joining the reactor and crew compartment. In the
experiment the fast-neutrons from the reactor were
filtered through 45 cm of water prior to beaming
into the air. Some data were also obtained for
neutrons filtered through only 15 cm of water; for
this case, the energy spectrum and the angular
distribution? are somewhat different than those for
the 45-cm case, and therefore comparison of the
results for these two cases provides an indication
of the effect of a change in neutron energy spectrum
on the integration weighting factors. All the data
were obtained at a constant separation distance,
1, of 64 ft.

be obtained from the differential experiments, For
this purpose, the reactor shield surface source can
be replaced by a point source because the reactor
shield dimensions are small compared with the
separation distance. The strength of the equivalent
point source per unit solid angle in a given direction
must then equal the integral over the reactor shield
surface of the surface source strength per unit
area per unit solid angle in the same direction.

Definition of Dose Scattering Probability

The probability of the dose from a line beam of
fast neutrons scattering into the sides of a cylinder
is defined in Fig. 14.16, The radiation intensity
in direction (a,¢,) is conveniently given by the
dose rate on the surface of a unit sphere at co-
ordinates (a,¢,). This dose isdenotedby D (a,é,).
Consider the radiation passing through the ele-
mental area 4() about the point (c,,) on the unit
“sphere. [f all this radiation uniformly intercepted
. the unit area at coordinate ¢, on the side of the
“cylinder, the dose rate of coordinate ¢, would

208

equal D (a, ,)dQ. The dose scattering probability
for a line beam is defined as the ratio of the actual
dose at ¢, due to the emission from dQ} to the dose
rate which would have been obtained if all the
radiation from dQ had arrived at the unit area about
coordinate ¢_. The dose scattering probability for
a line beam is denoted as PS(a,¢, - Bo)

By symmetry, the line-beam dose scattering
probability is a function of the difference in the
azimuthal angles (¢, ~ $5). Assume that P5(a,s,
~¢,) is known. Let the angular distribution of the
dose rate on the surface of the unit sphere about
the point source § be given by D(a,,). Then the
dose rate at coordinate ¢,, on the side of the cylin-
der is given by the integral shown in Fig. 14.16.
This integral weights the differential dose con-
tribution over the unit sphere by its proper scattering
probability.

In general, primary reactor shield configurations
are symmetric about the axis joining the reactor
and crew compartment, and so the radiation from
the primary shield is also symmetric about this

shell is a. For this symmetrical case, the dose
rate on the unit sphere is independent of the
azimuthal angle ¢,. Correspondingly, the dose

pendent of the azimuthal angle ¢,. The dose scat-
tering probability P®(a) for a conical shell beam
is defined by the integral over the azimuthal angle
¢, of the dose scattering probability for a line
beam. Assume P®(a) is known. Let the angular
distribution of dose rate on the unit sphere be
D (a). Then, on the basis of the definition of
P>(a), the dose rate at the side of the cylinder is
given by the integration shown in Fig. 14.17.

This integral weights the differential dose rate
contribution over the unit sphere by the dose
scattering probability for a conical beam. The
integration is taken with respect to the cosine of
the angle o that each conical shell in the beam
makes with the reactor crew compartment axis
(denoted by symbol ; on Fig. 14.17).

~ Evaluation of Probability from
TSF Experiments
Figure 14.18 shows how the dose scattering
probability is obtainable from the TSF differential
shielding experiments. The experimental fast-
neutron beam has an angular spread about its axis
of symmetry, as indicated in the figure. Hence,
there is obtained from the experiments the line-
beam dose scattering probability averaged in some
way over the given experimental beam, For the
present purpose the TSF beam geometry can best
be characterized by the polar angle @ measured
between the reactor crew compartment axis and the

Pa, = ,) Dola,$,) dQ

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1955

line of symmetry of the beam and by the azimuthal
angle ¢ which the axis of symmetry of the beam
makes with the horizontal plane. By definition,
the line-beam dose scattering probability averaged
over the experimental beam, denoted by Ps(6,y ~ b,)
is simply the dose scattering probability weighted
over the dose rate contribution of each differential
element of the beam divided by the integrated
dose over the experimental beam. The numerator
is simply the measured scattered dose rate at the
side of the cylinder; this rate is a function of the
beam angle 8 and also of the difference between
the azimuthal angles of the beam and of the unit
area under consideration at the side of the cylinder,
that is, of (y ~ ¢,). This is converted to the
average dose scattering probability for a conical
shell beam by integrating over the azimuthal angle
Y of the beam, Because the dose scattering
probability is a function of the difference in angles
(1/2 bo) this is equivalent to integrating over
angle ¢, for a fixed angle i. Substitution for

PS(6,yy ~ ¢,) of the equation at the top of Fig.
14.18 results in the final relation for obtaining,
from the experiments, the average dose scattering
probability PS() for a conical shell beam. The
numerator in this relation is the integral of the

* scattered dose, around the side of the cylinder,
_ with respect to angle ¢,» The denominator is the

integral of the direct-beam dose rate emitted from
the equivalent point source.
This relationship for conversion of the experi-

mental dose rate measurements to a fundamentally

basic probability function is general. It applies
not only to the scattered dose rate at the outside
surface of the cylinder but also to the dose rate at
various depths into the cylinder. In this case the
probability function is also a function of the shield-
ing thickness. This relationship is also applicable
for the scattered dose rate at the front or rear face
of the cylinder or for the scattered dose rate within

“the crew compartment cavity, The method of

evaluation of the scattered dose integral [numerator

‘in the PS(6) relationship] from the detector tank

measurements is presented in the following paper.
The method of evaluation from the experimental
results of the direct-beam dose rate integral
[denominator in the PS(6) relationship] is given
below.

Evaluation of Direct-Beam Integral

A plot of the relaxation length of the direct-beam
fast-neutron dose rate vs total water thickness be-
tween reactor face and detector is given in Fig.
14.19. Because of the large separation distance
between the dosimeter and the reactor face in the
TSF experiment, the relaxation lengths measured
correspond to the point attenuation kernel for the
fast-neutron dose rate, For comparison, relaxation
lengths obtained from BSF data and corrected for
geometry to correspond to a point attenuation kernel
are also plotted in Fig. 14.19, The TSF and cor-
rected BSF data agree well in the overlapping
region, both as to magnitude and to trend.

The variation of the dose rate measured at the
rear of the detector tank as a function of beam
angle § is shown in Fig. 14,20. The ordinate is
the ratio of the dose rate for beam angle 6 to the

- dose rate for 6 = 0 deg, that is, when the reactor
is pointed directly at the detector tank, For a given
““’dngle 0, the dosimeter in the detector tank reads
the direct-beam dose rate coming off at angle 6

plus an air-scattered dose rate from the other por-

tions of the beam. At § = 0 deg the direct-beam
dose rate is large, and therefore the scattered dose
rate is negligible. As 6 increases, the direct-beam
dose rate decreases rapidly, owing to the beam
collimation, and the scattered dose rate becomes
proportionately larger. In order to evaluate the
direct-beam dose rate integral, it is necessary to
subtract out the scattered dose rate. The method
used was, briefly, the following: The neutron
angular emission from the faces of the reactor was
assumed to have a cosine distribution. The direct
beam from the reactor faces was attenuated along a
straight-line path by using the relaxation lengths
shown in Fig. 14.19. The results of this procedure
for the various angles 0 are shown in Fig. 14.20.
The calculated direct-beam curve and the measured
direct- plus scattered-beam curve agree well for 9
below about 45 deg, where it is to be expected that
the scattering contribution will be relatively small.
For 0 greater than about 45 deg the calculated
direct-beam dose rate drops rapidly, and, at 90 deg,
the direct-beam dose rate is down by a factor of
103. As expected from the geometry, the dose rate
measured at § = 90 deg is an almost totally scattered
dose rate. The scattered dose rates measured at
the side of the detector tank for 8 = 90 and 135 deg
are also given in Fig, 14.20. The ratio of rear- to
side-scattered dose rates for these two angles is
about 1.6. If this ratio is assumed to be valid to
6 = 60 deg, an estimate of the rear-scattered dose
rate based on the measured scattered dose rate
at the side can be made for 6 = 60 deg. If this
is done and the estimated rear-scattered dose
rate at @ = 60 deg is added to the calculated direct-

“beam dose rate, the result: s that given by ‘the

Calculation of Scattered Dose

Figure 14.21 presents a typical plot of £2p (8)
vs the angle 0 of the conical shell beam. Note
that the ordinate is the product of the square of
the separation distance by the dose scattering
probability for a conical shell beam for this sepa-
ration distance. The dose scattering probability
presented in Fig. 14.21 is for a water thickness

distance fof 64 ft. The functional dependence of
PS(6) on p, t, and { should be accounted for in

scattered dose rate calculations. In the present

experiments a range of values of ¢ is covered for a

“single separation distance {and for a single valve
of p; however, some data were obtained with p

changed from 45 to 15 cm, and the effect of this

‘change on the dose scattering probability is dis-
cussed later. To illustrate the use of the dose

scattering probability for a conical shell beam in
the prediction of scattered dose rate, assume that

‘the angular distribution of the dose rate emission

from a primary reactor shield is obtained by dose
rate measurements at a distance d from the reactor.
This dose rate distribution obtained at distance d
is denoted as D(6,d). Then D6,d)d? is the dose
rate which would be obtained on the surface of a

“unit sphere drawn about the equivalent point source.
: The scattered dose rate is obtained by weighting
- D7(6,d)d? by the scattering probability P(6) de-

termined from the differential experiments and
integrating with respect to y = cos 4 (first integral
in Fig. 14.21). The second integral in Fig. 14.21,
which is equivalent to the first, is in terms of the
£2pS(8) used in the plots.

Effects of Direct-Beam Collimation

Figure 14.22 shows the effect of beam collimation
on the dose scattering probability averaged over
the beam. These results were obtained from single
air-scattering calculations. The beam in the TSF
experiments had approximately a cos4 distribution,
The cos® and cos'® distributions represent an
increasing degree of collimation of the beam. It
must be remembered that in the interpretation of
the TSF experiments the assumption was made that
the dose scattering probability averaged over the
TSF experimental beam was equal to the dose
scattering probability for a differential beam having

- an angle 6 equal to the angle of the axis of symme-

try of the experimental beam. These results indi-

-cate that this assumption is valid within 10 to 15%

for beam angles greater than 30 deg. For beam
angles between 0 to 30 deg the averaging of the
dose scattering probability is quite sensitive to
beam collimation, and therefore the experimental

results obtained are not valid if any sharp well-
“defined beams are emitted from the reactor shield
_in this range of beam angles. Consideration of
~~ multiply scattered neutrons in the calculations
~~ would have tended to reduce the effect of beam

collimation shown on this figure because the
sources of multiply scattered neutrons are of
necessity more diffuse than the sources of singly
scattered neutrons.

Effect of Neutron Energy Spectrum

A small amount of data was also obtained for a
water thickness of 15 cm at the reactor to obtain
an indication of the effect of change in neutron
spectrum on the dose scattering probability.
Figure 14.23 presents the angular distribution of
the dose rate at the rear of the detector tank for
p = 15 cm of water. Again, to obtain the direct
beam dose rate, it is necessary to subtract out the
scattered dose rate, The procedure described for
the p = 45 cm case was used, but the results are
not nearly so satisfying, The calculated direct-
beam dose rate has a flatter distribution than the
measured direct plus scattered dose rate in the
region of 0 = 0 to 45 deg, where the scattered dose
rate should be a relatively small contribution.
For all the data obtained at p = 45 cm, both for the
direct-beam and scattered dose rates, a plot of the
dose rate vs the beam angle always showed a
slight dip in the curve in the region of 6 = 30 deg.

   

This dip has been attributed to an out-of-roundness

of the uncertainties in arriving at this percentage
difference adds up to the order of 20%. Hence, at
least a 20% figure should be placed alongside the

The plot shows that the relaxation length of the

serves as a basis for a prediction of the results of
future mockup experiments. It is the purpose of
this paper to correlate the results, to date, of the 4 )
mockup experiment and the differential experiments
and to outline the procedures for future predictions.

In the mockup experiment the reactor was encased
in the R-1 shield (Fig. 14,25), and measurements
were made with a fast-neutron dosimeter along the
x axis in the detector tank. The experimental
values obtained in that experiment are compared
with values predicted by applying the data differ-
ential and the procedures given in the two preceding
papers.

Since the differential experiment includes x
traverses across the detector tank and z traverses
up and down in the tank, the extrapolation of the
dose rate measurements to the surface of the four
faces of the tank would give dose rates (Fig.
14.18) from a line beam? emitted at a given @ as a
function of the angle ¢, (Fig. 14.26). The integra-
tion of the area under the curve in Fig. 14.26
would then be equivalent to the dose rate at a
point on the surface of the cylindrical crew com-
partment from a conical shell beam at the same
value of 6. A plot of a series of these integrated
dose rates as a function of water thickness of a 0

‘rate as a function of @ can be read from Fig. 14.27.
- These points — an example for a given water thick-
ness is shown in Fig. 14.29 — are plotted, and a

smooth curve is drawn between the points. This

shows the dose rate to be expected at agiven water

Rate at 64 ft from Reactor Encased in R-1 Mockup
as a Function of Reactor Angle 6.

thickness from a conical shell beam at any angle 6.
This distribution is weighted by the angular dis-
tribution of the mockup and integrated to determine
the total dose rate to be expected at a given water
thickness in from the side of a detector tank, A
plot of the total dose rate at a given water thick-
ness as a function of 9 for the R-1 mockup is given
in Fig. 14.30. This process was repeated for
several different water thicknesses at the detector
tank, and the results, along with the experimentally
measured values, are shown in Fig. 14.31. In
general, the agreement is good. The apparent dis-
agreement can be attributed to three factors, the
first of which is the uncertainty of the angular
distribution of the fast-neutron dose rate emitted
from the R-1 mockup. This uncertainty, possibly
the largest contributor to the disagreement, will be
cleared up by future experimentation, The second
factor contributing to the disagreement is the low
count rate encountered in the ‘actual R-1 experi-
ment, The third factor is the lack of complete

collimation of the direct or unscattered beam in the

differential experiment, as pointed out in ‘the
preceding paper.

angular distribution of the neutrons leaving the
inside surface of the crew compartment can be
assumed to be the cos? of the angle measured from
the normal to the surface. This picture, along with
Faulkner's work,® neglects any neutrons that
might go across the cavity and be reflected back
into it, This should be a small contribution to the
source strength, on the order of 10%, if an albedo of
Yo is assumed.

The dose rate at the center of the cavity of the

‘cylindrical crew compartment with the reactor en-

cased in the R-1 shield mockup can now be pre-
dicted. The source strength at the surface of the
cavity is found by making a calculation as out-
lined above except that a water thickness equal to
the side shielding of the crew compartment mockup
is chosen. This source strength is integrated
(multiplied by a factor of 5.1) to give the con-
tribution to the dose rate at the center of the crew

compartment mockup from neutrons scattered through
the side of the compartment.

The dose rate contribution at the center of the
cavity resulting from neutrons entering the rear
and the front of the crew compartment can also be
found from the differential data by using the y
traverses for a line beam at a given @ (Figs. 14.3
and 14.4). This is converted to data for a conical
shell beam by multiplying by 27. This gives the
dose rate at a given water thickness in the front or
the rear of the crew compartment as a function of
the angle 6. Again, by weighting these distribu-
tions by the angular distribution of the R-1 mockup,
the source strength at the inner surface at the
front and rear of the crew compartment can be
found, An angular distribution of emission from
the inner surface must be assumed and an integra-
tion performed to find the dose rate at the center
of the cavity, A good approximation is to again
use a cos? distribution for the front of the crew
compartment, but for the rear the distribution will
be closer to a cosine distribution because of the
existence of thick lead. The three component
parts of the dose rate at the center of the cavity
(the neutrons scattered in the side, the rear, and
the front) are then added. This prediction will be
completed when a more exact measurement of the
angular distribution of neutrons leaving the R-1
mockup has been made.
