Abstract

A rough survey of the nuclear characteristics of graphite-moderated
molten-salt reactors utilizing an initial complement of low enrichment
uranium fuel has been made. Reactors can be constructed with initial
enrichments as low as 1.25% U-235; initial conversion ratios of as high
as 0.8 can be obtained with enrichment of less than 2%. Highly enriched
uranium would be added as make-up fuel, and such reactors could probably
be operated for burnups as high as 60,000 Mwd/ton before buildup of fis-
sion products would make replacement of the fuel desirable. A typical
circulating fuel reactor of this class might contain an initial inventory
of 3600 tons of 1.8% enriched uranium, operated at 640 Mw (thermal), and
generate a net of 260 Mw (electrical). The total fuel cycle cost would
be approximately 1.3 mills/kwhr, of which 1.0 mill is burnup of enriched U-235.

SURVEY OF IOW ENRICHMENT MOLTEN-SALT REACTORS
To survey the field of low enrichment graphite-moderated reactors

a number of calculations have been made with the four-factor formula k ,= nepf.

The following fuel salt was considered:

mole %

UR, 20
11 TF . 70
Ber, 10

This salt has a melting point of about 900°F. It is probably more corrosive
than one mole % fuel, but is probably satisfactory for use with INOR-8. The
atomic concentrations were as follows at 600 - 650°F, per L. A. Mann:
20
Ii - 175.7 x 10° atoms/cc
Be ~ 25.12 x 10% atoms/cc

U =~ 50.22 x 102° atoms/cc
F 426.8 x 1070 atoms/ce

¢

The slowing down power of the salt is 0.0228 — composed of contribution

as follows: =

Fluorine .01k9
Ii 0051
Be 0028

The concentration of UF, 1s 2.62 g/cc; that of uranium is 1.98 g/cc. Graphite
was assumed to be of density 1.7, with 8.5L x 102° atoms/cc, and a ‘slowing down

~1
power of 0.0631 ecm ~. The graphite was assumed to have a o, = 0.0045 barns.

In the four-factor formula, n is taken for convenience to be that
for U-235, while the thermal utilization factor f is defined as the propor-
tion of thermal absorption in U-235. Thus, using cross sections derived
from Fig. 2.3, page 2.20, of ORNL-2500, Part 2, n for U-235 is taken as
2.47 x gat or n = 2.00. Effective thermal fisslon cross sections and absorp-
tion cross sections are assumed to be 528 barns and 650 barns, respectively,
corresponding to neutron temperatures of 600°¢.

The fast fission factor was assumed to be 1.02, since the values
calculated for graphite lattices vary from 1.02 to 1.04. This assumption
is sufficiently accurate for survey purposes.

For the calculation of the resonance escape probability, the reson-

ance integral was calculated from,
0.42

z
In this formula, = is the scattering cross section in barns per uranium
0

atom within the fuel channel, and = is the surface area of the fuel channel
per gram of U-238 in the channel. The first term is the same as the reson-
ance integral for an infinite medium of the fuel salt composition. This
formula, involving the first power of ° instead of EF was used because

it 1s more logleally extrapolated to the case of dilution of uranium with

fuel salt. For uranium metal this reduces to the familiar o. = 9.25 x 24.7 : .

In the fuel considered here, “5 = 43.3 , and o_ = 18.5 + 2h.7 - .

A series of reactors having tubular fuel channels on a square
array 1s considered. The spacing of these channels was arbitrarily taken
as 8 in. center to center, and the calculations are made for various volume
fractions of fuel in the graphite from 0.05 to 0.25. The following table
gives the fuel channel diameter, the value of S » the value of Tp and the
value of the resonance escape probability p for the different volume frac-
tions. Pp is calculated from p = eA where A 1s glven by,

where N_ 1s the U-238 atom density in the fuel channel and F is the volume

where e is the enrichment, a." is the effective absorption cross section for
U-235, and 7 1s the thermal flux disadvantage factor. For this survey, 7 is
assumed to be 2.0, which seems a reasonable value based on ORNL-2500. This
simplifying assumption was made to avoid calculating the flux distribution,
and probably 1s the roughest approximation made in this survey. Numerically

the above equation reduces to,

3.22 F e

f= 3.22 F e + 0.0137 F + 0.0028 F + 0.000768 (1 - F)

From B® the dimensiorms of a minimum volume cylindrical core were cal-
culated using a reflector savings of 2 ft. This is less than used in ORNL-2500,
but may still be optimistic because some fuel must be used in the reflector to
cool it.

Table IT gives the results of calculations for six values of the
volume fraction of fuel in the core and for two values of k,. The volume of
fuel in the core should be evaluated in terms of the external volume for a
circulating fuel reactor, which is about 0.56 cu ft per thermal megawatt, or
360 cu ft for a 260 Mw (electrical) plant. It is evident that one must pay
for conversion ratios above 0.8 with enrichments of over 2%.

The selection of an economically optimum reactor of this type
requires a knowledge of the method of chemical reprocessing and its cost,
and a way of calculating the effect of poisoning by buildup of fission pro-
ducts. The latter problem was looked at briefly, using as a basis the calcu-
lations of Blomeke and Todd (ORNL-2127), and assuming a buildup of Pu sub
infinity as defined in the Brookhaven Geneva Paper 461. For the very long
exposures it is Probable that the one~group calculations can not give a
good answer because of the large buildup of absorbing Pu isotopes. However,

it might be possible to operate a reactor such as Case 8 of Table II for as
3

~T-
long as 30 years at 640 Mv (thermal) without a need for the U-235 inventory
to increase by more than a factor of two, and with a breeding ratio averaging
greater than 50%, without any reprocessing.

For purposes of estimating the fuel cycle cost, a life of 10 years
without reprocessing was assumed. For this period, the U-23%5 concentration
would probably not have to be increased over its initial value, and the breed-
ing ratio should average at least 60%. |

Applying the formula of ORNL~-2500, but using the thermal cycle of the
reference design molten-salt reactor {CF-58-5-3), the chemical reprocessing
charges and fuel inventory charges are 0.034 mill/kwhr and 0.14 mill/kwhr,
respectively. Ten-year depreciation and capital charges on the base salt
amount to 0.093 mill/kwhr. Burnup of U-235 would be a1.0 mill/kwhr at a
conversion ratio of 0.6. Thus, total fuel eycle costs would be approximately
1.3 mills/kwhr.

This reactor was based on Case 8 of Table IT, using a total fuel

volume of 600 £0

and an inventory of 36 tons of uranium of 1.8% enrichment.
The ten-year reprocessing cycle represents a fuel life of approximately
60,000 Mwd/ton.

More accurate calculations are needed to confirm the gbove conclusions.
