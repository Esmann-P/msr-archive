576 Mwt Natural Convection
Molten Salt Reactor Study

: Introduction

(1, 2) of molten salt natural convection reactors

Studies héve been made
of 5. Mv and 60 Mir thermal output. The following study of a 576 natural
convection reactor was made to compare with the family of" large molten salt,
reactors being presently studied. Co .

The chief purpose of this study isto determine the approximate size
of the components and fuel volume of the fuel circuit of a 576 Mw natural

convection molten salt reactor.

Riser Calculations

For the purpose of this study a rather simple configuration of reactor,
heat exchanger, and piping was chosen as shown in Fig. I. ALL calculations
vere done on the basis of one. heat exchanger and one: :set of risers and down-
comers . Since. the frictional losses in the piping are determined: Primarily
by the expangion and contraction losses. and are insentitive to wall friction,
the si ingle riser can be replaced by a: “number of risers having the same height
and total cross sections. Likewise, the heat exchanger can be replaced by. a
number of heat éxchangers having the same length of tubes and total number of
tubes.

The following. expression was derived for the height of the riser (see
Appendix A).

Heat Exchanger Calculations:

On the basis that the heat exchanger is of the counterflow tube and shell

From this we can calculate L, N, and heat exchanger volume against heat
exchanger pressure drop for different At's. The temperatures used were:
fuel entering the heat exchanger at 1210%F and leaving at 960°F to 10%5°F.
The wall temperature was taken as going from 850° to 1050° , giving the
following temperature conditions:

The total volune of the system is equal: to the volime of the piping plus

the volume of the heat exchanger plus 300 £2

Discussion

On the basis of this preliminary investigation; Large natural convec-
tion reactors do not seem to be very attractive. The ‘elimination of fuel
pumps seems to be more than palanced by the increase in fuel volume, and
number of heat exchanger tubes although it is possible that the large number
of heat exchanger tubes can be reduced by using fuel outside of firmed tubes.
An investigation into the cost of various molten salt reactor typest™®) shows
the cost of a natural convection resttor to be higher than comparable forced
fuel circulation systems.
