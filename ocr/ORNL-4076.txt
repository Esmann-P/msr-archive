The concept that chemisorbed water decreases the pore volume is not adequate to explain the observed
decreases in nitrogen and water surface areas of nonporous thoria, nor is the smaller size of the water

THE EQUILIBRIUM PHASE DIAGRAM FOR
THE SYSTEM LiF-BeF,-ZrF,

R. E. Thoma H. A. Friedman
H. Insley?

Mixtures of "LiF, Bel ,, and ZrF, are of especial
interest in this Laboratory because such mixtures
serve as the solvent for ?*SUF, in the Molten-
Salt Reactor Experiment, Phase behavior of this
ternary system and of its constituent binary sub-
systems has, accordingly, been examined in some
detail. The binary systems LiF-BeF,*'% and LiF-
ZF * have been carefully investigated here and
elsewhere and have been described in available
literature. Study of the BeF,-ZtF, and the LiF-
Bel -ZrF, systems was completed during the past
year,

Most of the data for these systems were obtained
by the technique of thermal gradient quenching
followed by careful examination of the products
by optical microscopy,’ though the older technique
of thermal analysis was of value in some regions.
The regions of liquid-liquid immiscibility in these
systems were defined with the help of high-temper-
ature centrifugation® and careful examination of
the separated products.

The combined data were used in construction of
the phase diagrams shown as Figs. 1.1 and 1.2.

Invariant equilibria in these systems were found
to occur at the composition-temperature locations
listed in Table 1.1.

As Fig. 1.1 indicates, the binary system BeF
ZF, exhibits relatively simple phase behavior,
A single eutectic occurs at a relatively low ZrF,

concentration, and the system is free from binary

compounds. Two immiscible liquids occur in
mixtures containing 14 to 25 mole % ZF, ; the
upper consolute temperature is near 740°C,

The LiF-BeF ,-ZrF, system (Fig. 1.2) is, so far
as we are aware, the only ternary fluoride system
vet shown to include immiscible liquids. As the
temperature is increased above the liquidus, the
composition interval showing two liquid phases
steadily diminishes; it disappears at an upper
consolute point at 25 mole % LiF and 55 mole %
Bel, at 955°C.

This occurrence of two liquid phases in the
system at high concentrations of BeF, does not
prejudice use of materials in the composition region
near 65 mole % LiF and 30 mole % Bel, as fuel
solvents for molten-salt reactors.

PRELIMINARY STUDY OF THE SYSTEM
LiF-ThF -PaF

C. J. Barton H. H. Stone
G. D. Brunton

In the protactinium recovery studies described
in Chap. 3 of this report it has been generally
assumed that protactinium is present in the LiF-
ThE, (73 mole % LiF) melts as PaF,.
sumption has seemed plausible since the melts
have, in every case, received a treatment with H,
at temperatures near 650°C, and since H, is known
to reduce pure PaF_ to PaF, at much lower temper-
atures. (The Pa't state seems to be the lowest
known in fluoride systems.) We have, however,
conducted a few preliminary experiments to test

This as-

this assumption and to see if the phase behavior
of PaF, is similar to that of Th¥F, in mixtures
with LiF.

About 100 mg of ?*!'PaF, was prepared by
evaporating a measured portion of purified stock
solution (9 M in HF) to dryness in platinum and
heating the residue to 600°C in flowing HF-H, mix-
ture. Conversion to PaF, was confirmed by weight
and by the brown color of the material. A portion of
this material was mixed with LiF-ThF, (73 mole
% LiF) to yield a mix with 68 mole % LiF and 32
mole % (Th,Pa)F,. Another portion was mixed
with LiF and the LiF-ThF, mixture to yield a
mix with 73 mole % LiF and 27 mole % (Th,Pa)F,.
Both mixtures were admixed with ammonium bi-
fluoride (whose decomposition products on heat-
ing help to minimize possible hydrolysis), heated
to 650°C, and cooled slowly.

Examination of the slowly cooled melts showed
that segregation of PaF,-rich phases from the
bulk of the LiF-ThF, material occurred in both
cases. Material from the mixture with 68 mole %
LiF is believed to be a solid solution of LiPaF,
in LiThF,. One of the phases from the sample
with 73 mole % LiF is believed, because of its
similarity to the analogous uranium compound, to
be Li PaF,. The PaF, does not appear iso-
morphous with ThE; the LiF-PaF system may,
in fact, be more like the LiF-UF, than the LiF-
ThF, system. It is obvious that study of the binary
LiF-PaF, system is needed before attempting
further deductions concerming phase relations in
the ternary system LiF-ThF -PaF .

A portion of the LiF-ThF -PaF, mixture with
73 mole % LiF was transferred to a small thorium

crucible and heated to 650°C in a helium atmos-
phere. Examination of the material with the polar-
izing microscope revealed some Li ThE,, but a
large part of the mixture was in the form of opaque
angular fragments, which are probably protactinium
metal. X-ray examination will be required to con-
firm this conclusion.

APPARATUS FOR AUTOMATIC DIFFERENTIAL

Fluoborate mixtures containing high concentra-

ants in molten-salt breeder reactors.’

Since such

niques of thermal analysis and thermal gradient
quenching are applicable only with difficulty to
these materials. We have, accordingly, developed
(with help from the ORNL Instrumentation and
Controls Division) a sensitive automatic differ-
ential thermal analysis apparatus for study of the
fluoborates.

This equipment, similar to that used by Holm,®
consists of a series of components assembled as
illustrated in Fig. 1.3. Specimens are contained
in sealed thin-walled nickel tubing, having outer
dimensions ¥% x 2.5 in. Temperatures are monitored
by armored 40-mil thermocouples which are posi-
tioned from below in reentrant chambers. Specimen
containers and thermocouple assemblies were de-
signed for minimal heat capacity, The specimen
thermocouple supplies a signal in opposition to
that from a matched cell containing fired Al,O,
as a comparison standard. Both cells are mounted
in a massive nickel block and out of direct thermal
contact with the block by means of ceramic sup-
ports. An independent thermocouple embedded
in the block provides a signal which programs
the temperature and heating rate of the system as
a whole. Differential temperatures are recorded
as a function of time on a model 7002AMR Moseley

Previous studies'® '? have shown that phase
relationships in the LiF-CeF, and NaF-Cel,
systems are very similar to those for their LiF-
PuF, and NaF-PuF, counterparts. A brief ex-
amination of the KF-CeF , system has, accordingly,
been conducted to show probable behavior for
KF-PuF,. Woik will begin on KF-PuF, as soon
ag differential thermal analysis equipment becomes
available to provide adequate sensitivity with
small amounts of materials.

We obtained thermal analysis data from cooling
curves obtained with a bare platinum—platinum~
rhodium thermocouple immersed in the melt con-
tained in a small (5 ml) platinum crucible. The
calculated weights of KF and CeF, (to give 3 to
4 g total) were placed in a crucible along with
several grams of ammonium bifluoride, and the
mixture was heated in a flowing stream of helium,
slowly at first until the ammonium bifluoride :de-

Gradient quenches were performed with portions
and the resulting
samples were examined by use of a polarizing

complete investigation are as follows: There is
one eutectic composition at about 19 mole % CeF,,
melting at 625 + 5°C, and two incongruently melt-
ing compounds, 3KF.CeF, and KF. CeF,. The
former melts at 675 + 5°C to give KF.CeF, and

analysis did not indicate the upper and lower sta-

It was interesting to compare the data obtained
for this system with the proposed diagram for the
system KF-NdF, recently reported by Schmutz, 12

melts it’ seems probable that the system is mare
complex than shown by Schmutz’ diagram. We
plan to perform further thermal analysis and quench-
ing studies to better define the composition of the
high-temperature cubic phase mentioned above.

site at (0.275, 0.275, 0.275), and a second fraction-
ally occupied fluorine site at (4, x, x). For
51.2% LuF,, x = 0.114, and for 56.6% LuF,, x =
0.061. The corresponding R factors are 4.6 and
3.8% respectively.

Fluorine-fluorine distances are impossibly short
and would seem to be unacceptable even if x = 0.
The model is unrealistic also in the constraints
necessarily imposed upon thermal parameters in
order to assure convergence: the isotropic thermal
motion parameters of the two types of fluorine
were constrained to be equal.

We conclude that the anion interstitial model is
tenable only if the static fluorine displacements
from %, Y %) and (%, 0, 0) are fictitious and
that anharmonic thermal

THE CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF ,-CsBeF,

H. Steinfink!? G. D. Brunton

The gamma (low-temperature) form of the com-
pound CsBeF, crystallizes in space group Pama
with a = 4.828 A, b, = 6.004 A, and c - 12.794 A.
The x-ray density is 3,56 g/cc, and Z = 4. Nine
positional parameters and 16 anisotropic tempera-
ture factors {Table 1.3) were determined from re-
flections measured on a Norelco PAILRED auto-
matic crystal data collector. The parameters were
refined by least squares to an R of 0.11,

Each Cs¥ ion is surrounded by eight F7 nearest
neighbors with bond distances of 3.02 to 3.92 A
(Fig. 1.5). The Be?" jons have four nearest
neighbor F7 ions at the corners of a tetrahedron,
The Be?*-F™ distances are 1.47 to 1.62 A. The
structure of this compound is similar to that of
the high-temperature form of BaGeO,.'® The re-
pulsion of the doubly charged Be” * jons increases
the Be-F distances where the FF ions are shared
between two tetrahedra. This accounts for the un~
usually long (1.62 A) Be?*-F~ distances.

CENTRAL CATION DISPLACEMENTS IN THE
“TRIPYRAMIDAL" COORDINATION

D. R. Sears

All cations in NaNdF 2° and KLaF, (preceding
section) are located in ““tripyramidal’’ coordination
environments. Both sodium and potassium exhibit
targe displacements from their ideal positions,
although it has been assumed?! generally that the
cation should lie on the polyhedron medial plane.
Seeking an explanation of these data, we have cal-
culated potential energy sums? of the “‘exponential-
six’’ form:

tion. We used values of 0 and s from 7 through 12
and incremenied the central cation position along
the polyhedron figure axis from the medial plane

hedron were ignored, the anion framework was
assumed to be rigid, and r, was taken to be the
sum of Pauling radii,

For the examples studied so far (Na, Nd, and
mixed Na + Nd in NaNdF and K, La, and mixed
K + La in 8 -KLaF ) the Coulombic term varied
less than 0.1 to 1% for a 1-A displacement. By
contrast, relatively larger variations in the ex-
ponential-six and Lennard-Jones functions were
found. Results were nearly independent of choice
of function and choice of s or 0, insofar as the
qualitative conclusions are concerned, and ac-
cordingly the results are presented here only for

We conclude that the cation displacements can
be rationalized in terms of the relative insensitivity
of the Coulombic interactions to cation location
in these structures and that displaced potential
minima, or very shallow minima, in the remaining
potential contributions will suggest which anion
configurations will favor or permit cation dis-
placements.

Calculations are being extended to include other
framework structures containing tripyramidal co-
ordination polyhedra.

PREPARATION OF FLUORIDE SINGLE
CRYSTALS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES

R. E. Thoma R. G. Ross
H. A. Friedman

Our efforts to develop techniques for the produc-
tion of large (350 g), pure single crystals of LiF
with selected isotopic ratios?® have succeeded in
the production by Stockbarger-Bridgman methods
of crystals of as high chemical purity as can be
obtained with Czochralski techniques. Concentra-
tion of heavy-metal impurities in crystals produced
this year was found to be less than 2 ppb from
activation analysis and thermal conductivity data.
Thermal conductivity of these crystals, as meas-
ured by investigators at Cornell University, was
found to be virtually identical through the tempera-
ture range 2 to 50°K with the best “Lif crystals

By
programming the reduction of annealing tempera-
tures at a slow steady rate after crystal growth,
in one experiment at 2.5°C/hr in the temperature
range from 840°C to room temperature, the popula-
tion of crystal dislocations in LiF crystals has
been reduced significantly. Preliminary indica-
tion of the effectiveness of such programmed an-
nealing was obtained by neutron diffraction ex-
amination of ORNL-14,%% a 550-g crystal of lithium
fluoride of 99.993 at. % ’Li, which showed a major
volume of the crystal to be essentially free of
disorder.

Part of the effort to synthesize fluoride single
crystals was devoted to the preparation of crystals
for use in x-ray and neutron diffraction experiments,
For such purposes, neither size nor purity stand-
ards are as demanding as those imposed for LiF
preparation. Single crystals (approximately 1 cm
maximum dimension) of each of the three com-
pounds Li, Bel, Na, Zr F. |, and "Li,NaTh,F,
were grown by the Stockbarger-Bridgman method.
For other structural investigations?® which employ
even smaller crystals, suitable single crystals
of B-CsBeF, and Li UF, were grown by high-
temperature anneal-quench experiments.

the number of bridging ¥~ icons increases by 4a — b

representing the free energy increase associated
with the formations of 1 mole of bridging F™ bonds
from 2 moles of terminal F~ bonds. The develop-
ment of the model from this approximation is sum-
marized in Table 2.1, and equation numbers given
below are from that table. In the equilibrium con-

represented by adaptations (Eqs. 5-7) of Flory's

PHASE EQUILIBRIUM STUDIES
IN THE UO,-Z(0, SYSTEM

K. A. Romberger C. F. Baes, Jr.
H. H. Stone

The previously described study of the Uo ,-Zx0,
system in which a molten-galt flux was used to
achieve equilibrium between the oxide phases has
been completed during the past year. The com-
position assigned to the tetragonal solid solutions
at the eutectoid temperature (1110°C) has been

17

increased from the value 1 mole % uo, reported
previously to 2.7 mole % on the basis of recent
measurements which indicate that the previous
result had not corresponded to equilibrium. In
addition, analyses have been obtained on a mix-
ture of cubic UO, and monoclinic ZrO, which had
been equilibrated with a molten salt at ~ 600°C
for 60 days® giving ~0.3 mole % ZrO, in UQ,
and ~0.07 mole % UO, in ZrO,. These results
indicate a lower rate of exsolution of the two
phases with decreasing temperature than previously
estimated.

The revised phase boundaries in Fig. 2.1 reflect
these changes. In addition, the boundaries below
1150°C reflect the distribution behavior expected
for dilute solid solutions in the three two-phase
regions C = M, M = T, and C = T. In partic-
ular, it was assumed that the distribution coeffi-
cient (D, a ratio of mole fractions) for one com-
ponent between two solid solutions at equilibrium
would obey the relationship

log D=a+ b/7T. a7)

In the case of the M = T equilibrium, the esti-
mated dependence of X 7:0 ,(T)/Xz:0,(M) on tem-
perature indicates the enthalpy of the M + T transi-
tion in pure ZrO, (1170°C) to be 1.7 + 1 kcal/mole.
This compares favorably with a measured value
of ~1.4 kcal.” Just above 1150°C (the upper
limit of the present measurements) it is clear that
values of D must deviate markedly from those
predicted by Eq. (17) (corresponding to the sharply
bending dashed curves in Fig. 2.1) if the C = T
phase boundaries are to be consistent with the
published higher temperature data. Such pro-
nounced deviations from ideal behavior in solid
solutions that are still quite dilute seem unusual.
Consequently, additional measurements between
1150 and 1500°C by the methods used here would
be of considerable interest.

The precipitation of protactinium and uranium
from LiF-BeF -ThF, mixtures by addition either
of BeO or ThO_ was demonstrated several years
ago by Shaffer et al.8 1! as a possible method
for processing an MSBR blanket salt. The purpose
of the present investigation is (1) to verify that
the oxide solid phase formed at equilibrium with
UF ,-ThF ,-containing melts is the expected solid

the distribution behavior of Th** and U** between
the oxide and the fluoride solutions,

U*M(f) + Th*'(0) = U**(0) + Th*'(f) (18)
(here f and o denote the fluoride and the oxide
phases).

The experimental technique is similar to that
used in the U0,-Z:0, phase study (see preceding
section); Tho, and UO, were contacted with 2LiF-
Bel, containing UF, and ThF, within nickel
capsules under a hydrogen atmosphere in a rocking
fumace. The equilibrated oxide solids were al-
lowed to settle before the samples were frozen,
Good phase separation was obtained provided suf-
ficient quantity of the fluoride phase had been
added originally.

A (U-Th)o, solid solution has been found in
every sample examined thus far; the lattice param-
eter determined by x-ray diffraction’ was con-
sistent with the composition calculated for such
an oxide phase. The equilibrium quotient for the
metathesis reaction shown above was determined
by analysis of the fluoride phase for the small
amount of uranium which it contained. The results
obtained thus far give

at 600°C. The mole fraction of uranium in the
oxide phase, Xioy was varied from 0.2 to 0.9
while the mole fraction of thorium in the fluoride
phase was varied from 0.01 to 0.07.

It thus appears that the ut? present is strongly
extracted from the fluoride phase by the oxide
solid solution formed at equilibrium. This con-
firms the effective precipitation of U*" by oxide
first reported by Shaffer et al.® In addition, the
formation of a single oxide solution phase offers
a much more flexible and effective oxide separation
method for breeder blankets than would be the
case if only the separate oxides ThO, and UO,
were formed.

Morhese x-ray examinations were performed by G. D.
Brunton and D. R. Sears of Reactor Chemistry Division,
The mole fraction of ThO, in the oxide solid solutions
was calculated from the lattice parameter using the
equation given by L. O. Gilpatrick and C. H. Secoy,

to extend the range of oxide composition and ThF
concentration in the melts and to determine the
temperature coefficient of the distribution quotient.

Measurements of the solubility of BeO in LiF-
Bel , melts and of Z1O, in 2LiF-BeF + ZtF | melts
(simulating mixtures of MSRE flush salt and fuel
salt) have been completed. As described previ-
ously,??'13 the procedure consisted in withdrawing
from an oxide-saturated melt a filtered sample
which was then sparged with an HF-H, mixture
to remove the dissolved oxide as water. The total
amount of water liberated was determined by Karl
Fischer titration. The principal difficulty en-
countered with the method was in filtering the
samples. Particularly in the case of BeO-saturated
melts, the oxide crystals evidently were sometimes
small enough to pass through or to plug the filter.
The BeO solubility measurements were found to
be reproducible only after sevefal days of equili-
bration at temperatures above 600°C. Considerably
less difficulty was encountered with melts satu-
rated with Z:0,-

The results of these measurements are repre-
sented adequately (~ 120%) by the following ex-
pressions; the concentration unit employed is the

log a= ~1.530 — 2970/T ,

log b= 1.195 — 2055/T .

The results are reasonably consistent with pre-
vious, less direct estimates !* based upon measure-
ments of the following equilibria:

H,0(8) + 2F(d) = 0°7(d) + 2HF(g) , (23)
H,0(g) + BeF (d) = BeO(s) + 2HF(g) , (24)
20,008) + ZF (d) = Z10 (s) + 4HF(g). (25)

The tolerance of MSRE flush salt for oxide should
be determined by the solubility of BeO (Fig. 2.2).
When the flush salt becomes contaminated with
enough fuel salt (~1.6% by weight) to produce a
Z1F , concentration of ~ 0.0008 mole fraction, ZrO,
should appear as the least soluble oxide. The
oxide tolerance should then decrease with increas-
ing fuel salt content because of the mass action
effect of the increasing concentration of ZF ,.
This oxide tolerance should pass through a mini-
mum at X zp, 0.01 (Fig. 2.2), and then it should
increase because of the effect of the medium upon
Z10, solubility. The oxide tolerance of such fuel-
salt—flush-salt mixtures is given by

The solubility of ZrO, was also measured in a
salt mixture whose composition (65.5% LiF-29.4%
BeF ,—5.1% ZtF ) simulated more closely the
MSRE fuel composition than did the 2LiF-BeF, +
ZF, mixtures. The results (Fig. 2.2) differ little
from the values given by the equation immediately
above for the case where X, 44 = 0.05.

The effect of salt composition on the 210, solu-
bility product may be caused, at least in part, by
specific chemical effects, that is, complex forma-
tion. For example, the form of the expression for
the variation in the ZrO, solubility product is
consistent with — though it does not prove the
existence of - the following complex-forming
reaction,

to ionic motions. In this study, C was calcu-
lated from the relationship

C

_ p
Cy 1+ (au’MT/C) ’ (28)
where C_ is the heat capacity at constant pressure
of 1 gram-formula weight, a is the volume expan-
sivity, po is the velocity of sound in the molten
salt, M is the gram-formula weight, and T is the
absolute temperature. The volume expansivity is

obtained from density-temperature data by

1 (2)
p \OT p

where p is density and p is pressure.

For systematic study, it is necessary to compare
C, of the salts at corresponding temperatures.
An obvious corresponding temperature is the melt-

a =

ing point. Other corresponding temperatures were

defined empirically by the equation

T=T, + AT, -T,), (29)
where T, and T are the normal melting and boil-
ing points respectively, and is a constant that
may vary between 0 and 1.

Values of C at Tr, and at some other corre-
sponding temperature are given in Tables 2.2 and
2.3. An obvious limitation of this treatment is
that, since virtually all available data were ob-
tained at atmospheric pressure, the values cal-
culated for a single salt at the various tempera-
tures (as in Table 2.2) do not refer to precisely
the same volume. A method for calculating the
effect of temperature on a truly constant-volume
heat capacity is described briefly in the following
section.

The ‘“‘experimental” C ’s listed in Tables 2.2
and 2.3 exceed in almost all cases thosze calcu-
lated on the basis of contributions due to (1)
harmonic oscillation, (2) molecular rotation, (3)
intraionic vibrations. For the halides, it may be
shown that for contributions 1 through 3, the
highest calculated C would be based on the as-
sumption that each ion executes harmonic oscil-
lations in three coordinates. For instance, for
an alkaline-earth halide, if we assume only har-
monic oscillation, then C_ for 1 gram-formula weight

would be 9R cal/deg. If we assume a model for

C, would be less than 9R; for the example chosen,
assuming that the vibration of the ion [MX]' is
fully excited, C_ equals 8R. Since experimental
C's for mercuric salts are less than 9R, it is
quite probable the same associated species exist
in these salts.

Experimental C's of nitrates and sulfates are
especially interesting because these salts con-
tain bona-fide complex ions, that is, nitrate or

assumed as YR. Contributions due to harmonic
oscillation for the nitrates were assumed equal
to 6R, and for the sulfates, 9R. Note in Table 2.3
that the experimental C_ for these salts always
exceeded the value calculated based on the con-
tributions just noted.

Two general patterns are clear from this study:
(1) experimental C, exceeds that calculated on
the basis of simple classical and/or quantum con-
tributions; (2) C, decreases with increasing vol-

ion that is associated with harmonic motion (see
following section); this excess cannot presently
be calculated with very much accuracy. Pattem 2
probably reflects the decrease in average potential
energy per ion that occurs when the volume of the
liquid increases. In other words, the liquid ex-
hibits more gaslike behavior as volume increases;
the kinetic energy contribution per ion probably
remains at 7,kT, but the potential energy contri-
bution slowly decreases with volume.

TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT OF C
FOR MOLTEN SALTS

Stanley Cantor

As noted in the previous section, experimental
values of C, for molten salts exceeded values
calculated from the expected contributions (i.e.,
degrees of freedom). To determine how the inter-
nal energy is changing with temperature alone,
it is necessary to evaluate C maintaining the
volume constant with changing temperature. The
method of evaluation used here is similar to that
published by Harrison and Moelwyn-Hughes. 7”

For all salts, C increased with temperature when
compression was necessary to maintain constant
volume. When pressure was decreased, C_ de-
creased with temperature. Some typical results are
shown in Tables 2.4 and 2.5. :

These increases of C, may be correlated with a
decrease in the elastic forces holding the ions
together. Such a decrease in elastic forces for
the crystalline state usually means that the aver-
age potential energy exceeds the average kinetic
energy.2! Because the temperature range examined

The temperature variation of isothermal com-

equation (see previous section)

Individual values of BY. at temperature T were ob-
tained from the expression

reflect the observation that sonic velocity in this
medium does not vary with temperature; this ob-
servation is most likely erroneous,

Since the constants A and b are rather restricted
in magnitude, it is an easy matter to empirically
estimate B. for salts as yet unmeasured. For
instance, one might predict, by a rough interpola-
tion between KCI and CsCl, that for RbCl, 4 =
65x10 2 and b=1.77 x 10°.

correlates BY with T are not as yet known. The

narrow ranges for A and b are perhaps more under-
standable. Compressibility at low pressure most
likely represents squeezing against the volume not
occupied by the ions, that is, the “free” volume.
Since the forces exerted by the jons on this free
volume should be virtually independent of the kind
of ions, it fellows that increases in free volume
which occur with temperature should be roughly
the same for all ionic liquids; hence the tempera-
ture dependence of squeezing against the free
volume would also be essentially independent of
the ions involved.

VISCOSITY AND DENSITY IN THE LiF-BeF
SYSTEM

C. T. Moynihan 22 Stanley Cantor

Dengities and viscosities of selected composi-
tions in the LiF-BeF , system were measured to
determine if temperature coefficients of viscosity
are correlated with coefficients of volume expan-
sion.

The viscosity of pure BeF , was measured over
the temperature range 573 to 985°C, using Brook-
field LVT and HBF 5X viscometers. In this range
the viscosity, 7, varied from 10 to 10° poises and
was about 10% greater than previously reported. #®
The plot of log n ve 1/T(°K) showed only slight
curvature. A least-squares fit of the data to an
equation quadratic in 1/7 yielded

(standard error in log 5 = 0.013). This equation
yields an activation energy for viscous flow of
57.3 kcal/mole at 985°C and 59.6 kcal/mole at
575°C. These are relatively small activation en-
ergy changes; thus the temperature dependence
of viscosity for BeF, is basically Arrhenius over
the range covered in this investigation (10 to 10°
poises).

our density results yielded a value of 1.96 +£0.01

1.968 g/cm® measured for the BeF glass at room

Transpiration Studies in Support of the
Veocuum Distillation Process

To determine the equilibrium vapor separation of
rare-earth fission products from MSR carrier salts,
a series of vapor pressures have been measured
by the transpiration (i.e., gas-entrainment) method.
The melts were composed of 87.5-11.9-0.6 mole %
LiF-BeF -LaF .. The concentrations of LiF and
BeF , are approximately those expected in the still
pot of the vacuum distillation process. The lan-
thanum concentration is many times greater than
what would be permitted as total rare-earth concen-
tration in the still; this high concentration of lan-
thanum in the melt was required in order to give
lanthanum concentrations in the vapor that were
high enough to analyze.

Measurements were carried out in the temperature
interval 1000 to 1062°C; dry argon, the entraining
gas, flowed over each melt at the rate of about
30 em3/min. Salt vapor, condensing in a nickel
tube, was analyzed by spectrochemical and neutron
activation methods. The latter method gave higher,
more consistent, and probably more reliable lan-
thanum analyses. The most consistent results have
been obtained at the two temperatures shown below.

Vapor Pressures of 73-27 Mole % LiF-UF

The manometric pressure of this mixture, which
is the composition of the MSRE fuel concentrate,
was measured by the Rodebush-Dixon method?” in
the temperature range 1090 to 1291°C. The results
fit the equation

log p(mm) = 7.744 — 10,040/T(°K) . (41)

Transpiration studies have also been carried out
to determine thie composition of the vapor. The
results to date indicate that at 1050°C, the mole
ratio of LiF to UF, in the vapor equals 3.3.

an H_HE/F~ electrode and a Be?/Be?! electrode

Presently investigations are being made of nio-

measure the voltage of the cell

Be’|BeF ,,LiF||BeF ,LiF,NbF  [Nb® (42)
(in which the electrode compartments were of
graphite and, later, copper) have been only par-
tially successful because the voltage of this cell
invariably decreased with time, It is inferred, but
has not yet been proved, that the cell voltage
decreased because a small amount of beryllium
metal dissolved in the 2LiF:BeF solvent and
intemally shorted the cell. However, before these
decreases became marked, reasonably stable
voltages were observed, in one case for as long
as three days.

Measurements of the cell voltage were made as a
function of increasing NbF , concentration. (NbF
was added to the melt by anodic dissolution of nio-
bium metal.) The voltage first increased and then
remained constant, an indication that the melt
had become saturated with NbF ,. Based upon the
number of faradays which were required to reach
saturation and the amount of melt within the nio-
bium compartment, it is estimated that at 597°C
the solubility was ~3 x 107? equivalent of the
niobium salt per kilogram of. solvent. The cell
voltage al saturation was 0.96 £0.04 v. This value
can be combined with the free energy of formation
of dissolved BeF, (-214.6 keal /mole)3? to yield

The beryllium electrode has now been replaced
by an H,,HEF/F™ half-cell. The latter, while less
convenient to use than the Be”/Be?" half-cell, is
expected to yield voltages which are more stable
and reproducible. No results are yet available from
this new cell.

The value of X, that is, the oxidation state of
the niobium in the presence of the metal and the
fluoride salt, appears to be +2. This is a tentative
conclusion based upon the results of a transpira-
tion experiment in which a known amount of pas-
eous HF was used to partially oxidize niobium
metal in contact with the melt. The value of the
oxidation number was then determined from the
amount of metal which was consumed. No apparent
evolution of NbF occurred, which is consistent
with a stable lower valence state.

which is emphasized here.

The study of sublimation heats with a mass
spectrometer requires either a knowledge of frag-
meintation patterns of polymeric vapor molecules
or the assumption that a given ion, for example,
Li* or LiF", has only one neutral precursor.
This assumption, called the specificity rule, has
been found not to apply to lithium halides.®® The
fragmentation patterns of (LiF), have been the
subject of study.33/3* In addition,

The ionization efficiency ([.LE.} curves obtained
in this study possess structure to an unexpected
degree {considering that the vapor density for some
of the species corresponded to less than 107%
tori). Selected LE. curves are shown in Fig. 2.3.

The data were obtained using the retarding po-
tential difference method and a Bendix time-of-
flight mass spectrometer. Simultaneous determina-
tions were made for a reference gas with appropriate
appearance potentials and for twe salt ions. The
reference gas was admitted (at a pressure of 1 x

as to detect possible instrumental vagaries. The

As has often been observed for other gases, a
current of singly charged ions appears at some
onset potential and then increases linearly with
electron energy until a subsequent appearance

generation. These AP’s for fragment ions may

arise in several ways: ion pair formation, ioi-

which is in agreement with the literature value

acterized by formation of Li* and FO ia ground

successively greater values of the bond strengths,
D(Li F —F) and Di F, —F). This belief is cor-

timates of some other bond strengths and electron
affinities for some of the pertinent species may

be made. These include:

D(LiF , — Li) 8.0
D(LiF —F) 1.6
E (LiF — LiF) 3.35
EAL) 0.29
EAA F) 0.25

The value for EA(Li F) indicates the general de-
gree of uncertainty in these values.

With the derived value of D(LiF —Li) = 8.00 ev,
one would anticipate the possibility of producing
Lit from the dimer at an AP of 8.00 + 5.36 =
13.36 v. Our value of AP (Li*) = 13.6 + 0.3 indi-
cates that this process is responsible for AP (Li* ).
The second appearance potential, AP (Li%), is,
if real, not readily explainable since the lowest
excitation level for FP? is 14.4 ev and for Lit,
much more. Invoking possible precursor excitation
is not a happy explanation in view of the 0.5v
difference between AP (Li) and AP (Li) and the
agreement of our value of D(LiF) with the literature.

The onset potential for the mixed species LiBBeF *
can be used to estimate a D(LiBeF —F) =7.9v,
which is near D(BeF) = 8.02.%% This indicates that
the fluoride atoms are all associated with the
beryllium in the vapor species LiBeF . Consid-
eration of the energies and bond strengths and the
fear agreement between AP (Li F*) from LiF with

that from Li BeF, make it seem unlikely that
Li BeF , is a precursor of Li F*.

For Bel N an additional set of possibilities mus:
be considered as causes of structure in the LE.
curve. These include autoionization and meta-
stable ion formation. Since all of the ions except
possibly Li" present marked similarity of structure,
it seems most plausible that even for the species
from Li ,BeF the structure observed is attributable
to ionic excitation, either vibrational or electronic.

The energies determined can be used to predict
possible appearance potentials beyond the limited
range used in these studies. For examples,

The ion Li Ber was also observed but in too
small amounts for AP determinations. During the
melting of one sample of Li BeF many bursts
of Co, were observed; these bursts total about
2 x 107% atm cc g—?%, but we believe this did not
cause any irregularity in the Knudsen cell opera-
tion.

Some initial determinations were made of slopes
of log (I'T) vs 1/T for LiF species in order to
provide some comparison with the literature values
before undertaking the more difficult task of study-
ing the LiF-BeF system vaporization. The results
of numerous determinations are shown in Table 2.9

REMOVAL OF IODIDE FROM LiF-BeF MELTS

C. E. L. Bamberger  C. F. Baes, Jr.
The removal of iodide from LiF-BeF mixtures
by HF sparging, presumably by the reaction

HF(g) + 1" (d) «= F~(d) + HI(g) , 1)

was previously described!’? as a promising method
for removing 6.7-hr 3%] from an MSBR fuel at a
rate greater than the rate of decay of this nuclide
to 13%Xe.

One difficulty with the results reported pre-
viously was that poor recoveries (typically 80%)
of iodide were obtained by HI® sparging. Ia con-
tinued studies the cause of this has been traced
to small particles of salt entrained in the gaseous
mixture of HF, HI, and H, emerging froin the re-
action vessel. Evidently these particles caused
condensation of the HF and HI with water vapor
in the NaOH bubbler used to trap the HI. The
condensed droplets of acidic solution, readily
visible as a fog in the gas phase of the trap,
evidently did not react completely with the NaOH
solution, thus causing low recoveries. Introduc-
tion of a filter of sintered Teflon or gold in the
effluent gas stream ahead of the trap has resulted
in iodide recoveries greater than 95%.

It was found previously that the fraction of
iodide remaining in the melt ([I7]/[I7]% de-
creased logarithmically with the number of moles
of HF passed per kilogram of melt (a, /w),

This interpretation of the previous data was sup-
ported by the observation that, within the scatter
of the measurements, Q was independent of the
flow rate and the partial pressure of HF. In the
subsequent measurements, however, a fuller study
of the effect of the HF pressure at different tem-
peratures and as a function of melt composition
has shown a pronounced effect. It has been
found (Fig. 3.1) that Q varies approximately in-

versely with P as follows:

Variation of Q for lodide Removal (Eq. 2)
While the cause of this effect is still being in-
vestigated, it may be noted that if, in addition
to reaction (1), there is an appreciable solu-
bility of HI in the melt,

HI(g) = HI(d); ©, = [HIV/P, , “)

the above expression can be accounted for with
a «= 1/9, and 0 = Q,. Sparging with HI as well
as HF is presently being used to determine
whether or not equilibrium conditions are being
attained during the measurements and to determine
the solubility or other possible reactions of HI
in these melts.

Whether the dependence of Q on P is due to
a rate effect or to the occurrence of other equi-
libria in addition to reaction (1), it seems evident
that, in the application of this treatment to the
processing of an MSBR fuel, better HF utilization
(higher Q values) will be obtained at lower HF

REMOVAL OF RARE EARTHS FROM MOLTEN
FLUORIDES BY SIMULTANEGUS
PRECIPITATION WITH UF,

F. A. Doss  H. F. McDuffie J. H. Shaffer
The relatively low solubility of UF in fluoride
mixtures of interest to the MSR program® and the
known similarities of the crystal structure of rare~
earth trifluorides with UF, * ptovide a basis for
studies of the precipitation of solid solutions of
fluoride melts. Since
represent a major

these compounds from
fission product rare earths
portion of the poison fraction in the fuel of a
molten-salt nuclear reactor, this study may be
applicable toward the development of suitable
reprocessing methods for rare-earth removal.
Initial experiments conducted in this program con-
sidered the reduction of UF, contained in a re-
actor fuel mixture to UF, and the simultaneous
precipitation of rare-earth trifluorides with UF,
as the temperature of the fuel mixture was re-
duced. A second series of experiments is in
progress to examine the precipitation of rare
earths from a simulated fuel solvent upon addi-
tion of solid UF ,.

If all UF, contained in the current MSRE fuel
mixture, LiF-BeF ,-ZtF ,-UF (65.0-29.1-5.0-0.9
mole % respectively), were reduced to UF, the
solution would be saturated with UF, at approxi-
mately 725°C. By lowering the melt temperature
to 550°C, approximately 83.5% of the uranium
would be precipitated from solution. Results of
preliminary experiments designed to investigate
this reprocessing method demonstrated that LaF,
CeF,, and NdF, could be precipitated with UF ,.
Europium and samarium were probably reduced to
their divalent states by the in situ reduction of
uranium with added zirconium metal and showed
little or no loss from solution during the pre-
cipitation of UF,. Subsequent experiments with
excess reducing agent showed that cerium removal
could be related to the U®" concentration in solu-
tion by the equation

illustrated by Fig. 3.3, a value of about 0.55
was obtained for k in Eq. (5) for the simultaneous
precipitation of CeF,. Further
would be needed to verify this experimental re-
lationship for other rare earths of interest to the
program.

A more recent experimental program has been
concerned with the retention of
fluorides on a bed of solid UF,
reprocessing technique.
UF, was added in 30-g increments to approxi-
mately 2.2 kg of LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) that
initially contained 10~* mole fraction of CeF |
with about 1 mc of '#%Ce as a radiotracer. Fil-
tered samples of the salt mixture were taken
approximately 48 hr after each addition of UF,
and analyzed radiochemically for cerium. The
results illustrated a somewhat linear decrease
in cerium concentration as UF, was added and
corresponded to a solid phase which contained
about 1 mole % CeF,. Similar results were ob-
tained in a separate experiment with NdF ,
except that the solid phase corresponded to about
0.2 mole % NdF, in UF ,.

EXTRACTION OF RARE EARTHS
FROM MOLTEN FLUORIDES
INTO MOLTEN METALS

J. H. Shaffer F. F. Blankenship
W. P. Teichert W. K. R. Finnell
D. M. Moulton W. R. Grimes

This experimental program has been oriented
toward the development of a liquid-liquid ex-

34

traction process for removing rare-earth fission
products from the fuel of a two-region molten-salt
breeder reactor. In processing schemes proposed
for the reference design MSBR, uranium will be
removed by fluorination. Thus, for purposes of
this investigation, the barren fuel solvent has
been simulated by dissolving selected rare-earth
fluorides into a mixture containing 66 mole %
LiF and 34 mole % Bel ,. When this mixture is
contacted with a molten bismuthelithium mixture,
rare earths are reduced to the metallic state and
dissolved in the molten metal phase. The program
further envisions a similar back-extraction process
for concentrating rare-earth fission products in a
second salt mixture for disposal or further utili-
zation. Experiments conducted thus far have
examined the distribution of rare earths between
the two liquid phases as functions of the lithium
concentration in the metal phase. Studies of the
equilibrium

2Li°% + BeF w= 2LiF + Be? 6)

in the extraction system are currently in progress
to ascertain activity coefficients of lithium and
rare earths in bismuth and to study effects of salt
composition on rare-earth distribution coefficients,

Fluoride starting materials were prepared in
nickel equipment by treatment with HEF-H, mix-
tures at 600°C to remove oxide impurities and at
700°C with H, alone to reduce concentrations of
structural metal difluorides in the fluoride melts.
Selected rare-earth fluorides were added prior to
this treatment in quantities sufficient to attain
concentrations of about 10~* mole fraction in the
salt mixture. Bismuth was further purified by
treatment with H, at 600°C in the 304L stainless
steel, low-carbon-steel-lined extraction vessel.
Following this treatment the prepared salt mixture
was transferred as a liquid to the extraction
vessel. Each experiment typically contained
2.35 kg of bismuth and about 2 kg of the salt
mixture. Lithium, for incremental additions to
the experiment, was freshly cut and tared under
mineral oil, affixed to a small-diameter steel rod,
rinsed in benzene, and dried in the flowing inert
atmosphere of the loading post prior to its in-
sertion into the molten bismuth. This loading port
extended near the bottom of the extraction vessel
to avoid contact of lithium with the salt phase
prior to its dissolution into the molten metal
phase. Filtered samples of each phase were taken
under assumed equilibrium conditions after each
addition of lithium. Radiochemical analyses of
each phase for rare-earth gamma activity and
spectrographic analyses of the metal phase for
rare-earth and lithium concentrations provided
data for calculating the distribution of rare earth
in the system and its dependence on the lithium
concentration of the metal phase. A summary of
these results, illustrated in Fig. 3.4, shows that
a mixture containing 0.02 mole fraction of lithium
metal sufficed for removing essentially all cerium,
lanthanum, and neodymium and substantial quan-
tities of samarium and europium from the barren
fuel solvent under separate but comparative con-
ditions. In all experiments rare earths that were
reduced from solution in the salt phase were
found as dissolved components of the metal
phase.

The reduction of rare-earth fluorides by lithium
is expected to proceed by the reaction

mLi® + (RE)™* == (RE)? + mLi"*, va)

where m is the effective valence of the rare-earth
cation. If unit activities prevail for all metal
species in the salt phase and for all ionic species
in the metal phase, then the activity of lithium
dissolved in the metal phase can be expressed

In the beryllium-addition experiments at 600°C
a limiting mole fraction of lithium in bismuth was
reached. As this was well below the solubility,
it was assumed that the lithium was in equilibrium
with metallic beryllium. From this it was possible
to calculate an activity ceefficient for lithium of
9.8 x 107% to 1.3 x 10~* (two experiments) for
the mole fraction of lithium referred to a standard
state of unit activity (i.e., pure lithium). A sim-

the precipitated protactinium had deposited on the
vessel walls that were in contact with the salt

from nonwetting characteristics of the two liquid
phases, an experiment was conducted to examine
the absorption of ?33Pa on iron surfaces in the
absence of a molten metal phase. As a result of
adding thorium metal, 233Pa was found uniformly

distributed on steel wool that had been immersed
in a blanket salt mixture. When this salt mixture
was drained from the vessel and filtered through
sintered nickel, essentially no 23°Pa activity
could be found in the salt mixture or on the filter.

In other experiments in which no salt phase was
used, solutions of 23°Pa in molten lead or bis-
muth, obtained by the addition of irradiated
thorium metal, were not stable in either metal
solvent. However, a much larger fraction of
233pg activity was retained in bismuth than in
lead during 48-hr contact periods. Subsequent
examination of the low-carbon-steel vessels used
in these experiments showed a distribution of
?33pa on the container walls which resembled
sedimentary deposition of insoluble materials
rather than surface absorption. In view of earlier
results, tentative conclusions assumed that 233Pa
was preferentially absorbed on insoluble par-
ticles that were initially present in the molten
metals or formed by reactions with added thorium.

Since the anticipated function of the molten
metal phase in the extraction process is that of
an intermediate carrier for protactinium, the rate
at which ?32Pa can be extracted from the blanket
salt and concentrated in a second salt mixture by
back extraction with HF need only depend on the
mass transfer rate of protactinium dissolved in a
recirculating molten metal stream. Thus a pump-
loop experiment, shown schematically in Fig. 3.6,
was tried in an endeavor to achieve the transport
of 233Pa in bismuth while maintaining its con-
centration or that of its carrier at relatively low
values. Thorium was introduced into the system
by contacting the liquid metal with thorium chips
just prior to its reentry into the extraction vessel.
At low bismuth flow rates protactinium could be
reduced at the surfaces of free-falling droplets.
For simplicity the recirculating molten metal
stream was pumped through a bed of steel wool
to provide for the collection of protactinium, pre-
sumably by absorption, and to provide coarse fil~
tration of the bismuth in the event that ??°Pa
was being carried by suspended solid particles.
Surface areas of steel wool columns used in the
experiment were at least tenfold greater than
those of other iron surfaces exposed to the molten
metal elsewhere in the loop. The extraction
vessel was also provided with a niobium sleeve
to isolate the salt phase from the iron surfaces
of the loop.

37

The pump-loop experiment was operated dis-
continuously for approximately 60 hr over a period
of about six weeks and was terminated because
of pump failure. Material balance calculations on
the system at the conclusion of the experiment
showed that approximately 96% of the 23*Pa had
been removed from the salt mixture. At least
43% of the ?33Pa originally in the system had
been pumped as a solution or a suspension with
molten bismuth and deposited on rather small
volumes of steel wool. Since only 4% of the
233pa remained in solution in the bismuth, ap-
proximately 49% of the 233Pa was lost as solids
in the system. The collection of 2*3Pa on the
columns was, in fact, better identified with a
filtration process even though some surface ab-
sorption was apparent. Spectrographic analyses
of high-melting metallic plugs taken from the
system associated relatively high concentrations
of thorium with iron and chromium. These ob-
servations suggest that a more inert containment
material will be needed before a satisfactory

with helium at a rate of about 1 liter/min during
24-hr equilibration periods. Filtered samples of
the salt mixture were taken after each equilibra-
tion period and analyzed radiochemically for
233pa by counting its 310-kv photopeak on a
single-channel gamma spectrometer. At the con-
clusion of the experiment the mixtute was hydro-
fluorinated to convert added ZrO_ to its fluoride
salt and to restore 233Pa activity in the molten-
salt phase. This experimental procedure was
repeated with the same salt mixture for all three
lots of Zr0,.

In each experiment the addition of ZrO, to the
fluoride mixture resulted in the loss of protace
tinium from solution. However, as shown by Fig.
3.7, a plot of the reciprocal fraction of 23%pa
in solution vs ZrO _ added, yielded, according to
Eq. (12), distribution coefficients for ?*3Pa be-
tween the two phases which varied continuously
as the precipitation reaction approached comple-
tion. Although these experimental results are
contrary to those obtained previously, with re-
spect to the constancy of the 233Pa distribution
coefficients, they indicate that 23%Pa removal
from the salt mixture is probably not singularly
dependent on the surface area of the added oxide
particles nor on solid solution formation.

PROTACTINIUM STUDIES IN THE HIGH-ALPHA
MOLTEN-SALT LABORATORY

C.J. Barton ~~ H. H. Stone

The High-Alpha Molten-Salt Laboratory was
briefly described in the previous report,” and
results of the first experiments performed in this
facility were given. Attention has been focused
on development of methods of removing protac~
tinium at realistic concentrations (25 ppm) from
breeder blankets, but a few experiments have been
performed in an effort to obtain a better under-
standing of the chemistry of protactinium in
molten fluoride systems. Because of the variety
of experimental methods that have been applied
to the protactinium removal problem, only a brief
summary is presented here, with emphasis on the
experiments that gave the most promising results.
Some information from these experiments has been

previously reported. *®—12

Protactinium Recovery Experiments

We found that protactinium dissolved to the ex-
tent of 20 to 30 ppm in molten LiF-ThF , (73-27
mole %) could be readily reduced by solid thorium
or by thorium dissolved in lead. In the latter
case, only a small fraction of the reduced protac-
tinium was found in the molten metal phase. Re-
duction experiments with solid thorium in three
different container materials (nickel, copper, and
graphite) showed that more than half the reduced
protactinium remained suspended in the molten
fluoride mixture. We believe that the reduced prot-
actinium is attached to small particles of a struc
tural metal such as iron or nickel which are large
enough to be removed by the sintered copper filter
material through which the samples are drawn
but small enough

Partial reduction of protactinium was effected by
electrolysis with various electrode arrangements,
but very little protactinium was found in the
bismuth layer that underlay the molten-salt mixture
in most of the electrolysis experiments.

length of time in the high-density

The aim
of these experiments, to transfer protactinium
from the fluoride mixture to bismuth or to some
other electrode material that could be readily
separated from the salt mixture, was not realized.

Efforts to collect tracer quantities of reduced
233pa on steel wool have been reported.!® A
series of three experiments of this type were re-
cently performed with ??!'Pa concentrations in
an LiF-ThF , (73-27 mole %) mixture in the range
24 to 81 ppm. The principal variable was the
ratio of milligrams of 23!'Pa to grams of steel
wool. These ratios were 1.1, 3.1, and 6.5 for the
three experiments. Detailed results are given
only for one experiment (**'Pa to Fe ratio 6.5),
but conclusions are based on findings of all
three experiments, which gave similar results.

A weighed quantity of LiF-ThF, previously
purified, was placed in a welded nickel reaction

The data in Table 3.1 show that 99% of the
protactinium was precipitated in a form that
would not pass through a sintered copper filter
after a fairly short exposure to solid thorium, bat
nearly 7% was in the unfiltered salt that was
transferred back to the nickel vessel after ex-
posure to thorium. About 692 g of salt was associ-
ated with the steel wool in the steel liner in the
form of a hard ball. Partial separation of the salt
from steel wool was effected by use of a magnet
after crushing the ball, and the iron-rich fraction
had the higher protactinium concentration. The
small amount of protactinium found on the vessel
wall is especially notable. The last column in
Table 3.1 shows that a reduction in the iron cone
centration occurred concurrently with the reduction
in protactinium concentration. It may be signifi-
cant that the ratio of precipitated iron to precipi-
smaller in this

GRAPHITE-MOLTEN-SALT IRRADIATION

Irradiation of the first molten-salt convection

up to 105 w per cubic centimeter of salt were
attained in the fuel channels of the core of MSRE-
grade graphite.

Successful operation of the major heating,
cooling, temperature-control, and sampling sys-
tems was demonstrated; however, leaks developed
in two of the four cooling systems. The experi-
ment was terminated after radioactivity, resulting
from fuel leakage from a break in the sample line
near the loop, was detected in the secondary
containment.

Irradiation of a second loop, modified to elimi-
nate causes of failures encountered in the first,
will begin in January 1967. Operation at an
average core fuel power density of 200 w/cm?
for a period of the order of a year will be sought.

Objectives and Description

The loop is designed to irradiate a representa-
tive molten-salt fuel circulating at typical tem-
perature differences in contact with graphite and
Hastelloy N at desired core power densities of
200 w/cm?®, with provisions for gas removal and
salt sampling. In particular, it is desired to

41

study the interaction of fission products with
graphite, metal, fuel, and gas phases and the
stability of the fuel salt at high levels of burn
up. 14-17

The core of the first loop consisted of a 2-in.-
diam by 6-in.-long cylinder of graphite obtained
from MSRE stock. Through the core, eight vertical
Yin. holes for salt flow were bored, arranged
octagonally with centers % in. from the graphite
center line. A horizontal gas separation tank
connected the top of the core to a return line to
the core bottom, completing the loop. The tank,
lines, and the core shell were fabricated of Has-
telloy N. The heaters and the cooling tubes in the
core and return line were embedded in sprayed-on
nickel, as was the 12-ft sample tube leading from
the loop to the sample station in the external
equipment chamber.

Operations. — The loop was operated with MSRE
solvent salt for 187 hr at V-12, and several salt
samples were taken. It was inserted in beam
hole HN-1 of the ORR on June 9, 1966, and
operated 1100 hr with solvent salt; during this
period calibration and testing of equipment and
performance were conducted. The loop was in-
serted to the position nearest the reactor lattice
on July 21, and water injection into the air
streams to the tubular core coolers and the jacket
around the gas separation tank was tested. One
of the two core coolers leaked and was plugged
off. Water injection was discontinued until after
uranium addition.

On July 27, after sampling, eutectic "LiF-UF
(93% enriched) fuel salt was added to develop a
uranium inventory concentration of 1.36 mole %.
At this time a capillary tube in the sample re-
moval system broke, precluding further sampling.
An associated inleakage of air impelled solvent
salt to a cold spot in the gas sample line, thereby
plugging it.

During subsequent operation fission heat was
determined. During this period water was re-
leased into the loop container from what proved

Corrosion. — The level of corrosion products,

increased ia the successive samples. This was
possibly due to uptake of moisture by the solvent

salt prior to loading, with consequent corrosion
of the Hastelloy N. This appears to have occurred
in the addition tank, since a sample taken directly
from the addition tank without entering the loop
showed similar levels of corrosion products.

Fission Products. — Fission products were
counted in a fuel sample after 110 days’ cooling;
concentrations are given below as a percentage
of the amount produced, calculated on the basis
of observed fission heat (4.8 x 10!7 fissions/g).

Cerium-144 and -141 (77, 64%) and zirconium-89
(65%) were somewhat below the calculated pro-
duction. Cesium=137 (41%) and strontium-89 (42%),
with noble-gas precursors of ~3 min half-life,
could have thereby been lost to the gas space
or graphite voids. Tellurium-127 (10%) was
largely removed from the salt. Ruthenium-103
and -106, which were expected to deposit on
Hastelloy N surfaces, were not detected (<0.03%)
in the salt.

Nuclear Heat and Meutron Flux. — Nuclear heat
was measured at various loop insertion positions
by comparing electrical heat requirements under
similar conditions with the reactor at zero and
full power. Reactor gamma heat fully inserted
was 2900 w (with unfueled salt). With fuel con-
taining 1.36 mole % uranium (93% enriched),
fission heat in the fully inserted position was

5800 w.

The corresponding overall average fis-

42

sion heat density was 80 w per cubic centimeter
of salt at 650°C, and in the graphite core the
average fission heat deasity was 105 w per
cubic centimeter of fuel salt.

The overall effective thermal-neutron flux in the
salt was estimated independently from nuclear
heat, from activation of solvent salt zirconium,
from cobalt monitors in the loop exterior, and by

was found to have broken entirely loose without
ductility at its outlet end as it left the core near
a tack weld to the core shell. Intergranular cracks
originated on the outer circumference of the coiled
tube.

The cooling jacket on the gas separation tank
leaked at a weld. The fuel leak resulted from
a nonductile break in the Hastelloy N sample line
tubing near the attachment to the core bottom.
The sprayed nickel was also cracked in this
region.

Fuel salt in the form of a scale a few mils
thick was found on the interior of the core shell,
between it and the closely fitting graphite core.
The analysis shown in Table 3.2 appears to be a
mixture of fuel salt and Hastelloy N (probably
metal debris from cutup operation).

Hot-cell metallurgical examination of the in-
terior surfaces of the Hastelloy N comprising the
core bottom and core shell wall showed no evi-
dence of any interaction with salt or carbon, or
other change.

Temperature Control. — The response of the
heating and cooling systems to rapid changes in
the nuclear heat could only be tested under full
fission conditions in pile. Since this was re-
garded as important, reactor setback tests were
conducted. Temperature-control system response
was adequate to maintain the salt molten during
a reactor setback with resultant loss of 8.8 kw
of nuclear heat, and to return the loop to normal
operating condition during a rapid (11-min) return
to full power.

Sampling and Addition. -- Sampling and addition
systems and procedures were adequate to permit
addition and removal of molten salt while operating
the loop in pile and to transport shielded samples
under an inert-gas atmosphere to the analytical
laboratory. A broken capillary connecting tube
prevented additional sampling.

Salt Circulation. —- Convective salt circulation,
at rates of 5 to 10 cm®/min, was achieved by
causing the return line to operate at temperatures
below the core temperature. Flow stoppages

bility of argon cover gas at the varied tempera-
tures around the loop. Salt flow was reestablished
by evacuation and readdition of cover gas. Loss
of flow had no adverse effect on loop operation.

Second In-Pile Irradiation Assembly. — A second
in-pile molten-salt convection loop, essentially
identical to the first convection loop experi-
ment, !® has been constructed, and it is antici-
pated that in-pile irradiation will begin eatly in
1967. Problems encountered in the first con-
vection Joop experiment and subsequent post-
irradiation hot-cell examination, described above,
have led to modifications to the second loop
which are designed to eliminate these problems.

The coolant tubes, embedded in nickel spray
around the core section, are now of Y-in.-0D x
0.035-in.~wall Inconel tubing instead of the ein.
OD x 0.035-in.-wall 304 stainless steel used on

44

the first loop. The stainless steel tubing should
have been entirely adequate for the service, but
Inconel is the preferred material for exposure to
the high-temperature steam (~400°C) generated
when air-water mixtures are used as coolant.
Since the rupture of one of the core coolant
tubes occurred adjacent to a point where the
tube was tack welded to the core wall, the tack
eliminated in favor of a mechanical

weld was

strap attachment. An expansion loop to relieve
stresses has been included in each of the coolant
outlet lines. A mockup of the modified cooling
coil was operated at temperature with air-water
mixtures for more than 400 hr, including 120
thermal shock cycles (600 - 350°C), with no
sign of difficulty. Thermal cycling occurs during
a reactor setback and startup, and it is estimated
that no more than about 20 such thermal cycles
will occur during a year of operation.

The two failures which occurred in the capillary
tubing (0.100 in. OD x 0.050 in. ID) used in the
salt transfer system appear to have resulted from
excessive mechanical stress. Consequently, the
wall thickness of this line has been increased to
0.050 in., and additional mechanical support has
been added such that there is now no part of the
salt sample line which is unsupported — as was
the case in the first loop assembly.

The Y s-in.-thick stainless steel cooling jacket
surrounding the reservoir tank has been replaced
by an Incoae! tube wrapped around the outside
of the tank and attached by means of sprayed-on
nickel metal, as is done on the core section and
cold leg. Also, provisions for use of an air-water
mixture as coolant have been added, since it was
found that air alone did not provide sufficient
cooling in the first experiment.

Continuous salt circulation by
vection was not maintained in the first experi-
ment. It was concluded that loss of circulation

thermal coin-

was caused by gas accumulation in the top of
the core section. Accordingly, the salt flow
channels at the top and bottom of the eight «in.
holes for salt flow in the graphite core were re-
designed to provide better flow conditions!” at
the inlets and exits of the vertical holes. Fur-
ther, the top and bottom of the core section,
horizontally oriented on the first loop, were in-
clined at 5° to minimize trapping of gas.

EXTENT OF UF, REDUCTION DURING
MSRE FUEL PREPARATION

B. F. Hitch C. F. Baes, Jr.
Uranium was added to the barren fuel salt of
the MSRE as a binary mixture of 27 mole % UF,
in "LiF. This fuel concentrate had first been
purified by the usual sparging with an HF-H,
mixture to remove oxide, followed by sparging with
hydrogen alone to complete the reduction of struc-
tural metal fluorides such as NiF, and FeF,. !'?
During this final reduction step, a small portion
of the UF, should also have been reduced, the
amount depending upon the duration of the treat-
ment and the equilibrium constant for the reaction

UF (d) + KH, (¢) = UF (d)+ HF(g) .

The exact amount of UF ; thus introduced into the
MSRE fuel has become a matter of special interest
with continued operation of the MSRE, owing to
evidence that significant amounts of some fis-
sion products are far more oxidized (see following
section) than would seem compatible with the
presence of significant amounts of UF, in the
MSRE fuel. Consequently, the data collected by
Shaffer et al. ® during the purification of the fuel
salt concentrate at the production facility recently
have been examined in detail in an attempt to de-
termine the equilibrium quotient for the above re-
action,

the amount of reduced uranium present initially
in the MSRE fuel, an 11.4-kg portion of unused
fuel concentrate was studied further in the lab-
oratory. Hydrogen sparging was initiated at 510°C.
At this relatively low temperature, no significant
reduction of U*? to U3? should occur; however,
HF evolution was detected immediately and con-
tinued at a significant level until 250 liters of H,
had been passed and 0.0019 mole of HE per mole
of uranium had been evolved. This indicated that
inadvertent exposure of the salt to oxidizing im-
purities such as water or oxygen had occurred
during prior storage, during transfer of the sam-
ple to the reaction vessel, or in later handling.
Since the HF at this temperature in the amounts
seen should have quickly oxidized the UF; pres-
ent, it was not possible to confirm the amount
of UF, initially present in the fuel concentrate.
In two subsequent H, sparging runs at 700°C,

however, data were obtained which permitted im-

During periods of reactor operation, samples of

analyzed for major constituents, corrosion products,
and (less frequently) oxide contamination. Stand-
ard samples of fuel are drawn three times per

two weeks.

Current chemical analyses suggest no percep-

months ago. ¢

able scatter in these analyses, there seems to
be no indication of corrosion of the Hastelloy N
by the salt.

The fuel mixture in the MSRE contained (see
preceding section) considerably less UF, than
the quantity intended; 1.5% of the added uranium
was to he as U3*. Furthermore, the fission proc-
ess should prove oxidizing to UF, in the melt”?
(or to chromium in the Hastelloy N). The extent
to which the fission process should prove oxi-
dizing depends on several variables including (1)
the extent to which Kr and Xe are swept from the
reactor, (2) the redox potential of the fuel-metal
system, and (3) the extent to which evolution of
“unstable” species (such as MoF ( or RuF,) oc-
curs through nonequilibrium behavior. It
very likely, however, that fission of about 0.3 kg
of uranium (perhaps aided by a small amount of
inadvertent oxidation within the MSRE) can have
used up most of the UF, added. An attempt to
determine UF; concentration in the MSRE after
about 11,000 Mwhr of operation (by H,-HF equi-
librium, a method similar to that employed in the
preceding section) showed less than 0.10% of the
uranium to be in the trivalent state. ?

Accordingly, the lack of corrosion in the MSRE
seems to be somewhat surprising. It can be ra-
tionalized by the assumption (1) that the Hastelloy
N has been depleted in Cr (and Fe) at the surface
so that Mo and Ni only are under attack, with Cr
(and Fe) reacting only at the slow rate at which
it is furnished to the surface by diffusion, or (2)
that the noble-metal fission products (see section
on Fission Products on Metal and Graphite from
MSRE Core) are forming an adherent and protective
plate on the reactor metal.

Though neither of the analyses nor the reactor
behavior suggests appreciable corrosion, plans are
under way, and techniques are being studied, for
reducing about 1% of the MSRE UF, to UF; within
the reactor. Such a reduction (which would surely
take the MSRE fuel to near its intended UF, con-
centration) should remove all apprehension about
possible corrosion and should, we believe, allevi-
ate some of the problems of volatile fission product
fluorides (see subsequent sections).

Routine determinations of oxide (by study of
salt—H O-HF equilibria) continue to show low
values (about 50 ppm) for 02~. There is no reason
to believe that contamination of the fuel has been
significant in operations to the present.

MSRFE maintenance operations have necessitated
flushing the interior of the drained reactor circuit
on four occasions. The salt used for this oper-
ation consisted originally of an "LiF -BeF , (66.0-
34.0 mole %) mixture. Analysis of this salt before
and after each use shows that 215 ppm of uranium
is added to the flush salt in each flushing oper-
ation, corresponding to the removal of 22.7 kg of
fuel-salt residue (about 0.5% of the charge) from
the reactor circuit.

the reactor for approximately 6400 hr. Current
analysis of this salt indicates no corrosion or
leakage in the coolant salt circuit. On one oc-

by the radiator either as the salt froze or thawed.
It is believed that the remarkably low volume
change which the coolant salt undergoes in freeze-
thaw cycles (less than 5%) is a consequence of
the large free space found in the Li BeF, crystal
structure. °

Typical results obtained for these materials are
shown in the table.

The strontium and cerium isotopes are of special
interest as fission monitors since they have con-
venient half-lives and stable, nonvolatile fluorides
which would be expected to remain almost com-
pletely in the circulating fuel. The concentration
of these monitors, however, is in only fair agree-
ment with calculations based on power level of
the reactor from heat balance; fission power based
on °!Sr is 75% of nominal power, while that based
on '*3Ce shows 88% of normal reactor power.

Molybdenum and ruthenium are typical of a class
of metals expected to deposit, at least in part,
as elements. These analyses of the salt show
that these materials are present in less than the
expected concentration; if calculations of total
yield are based on °'Sr, about 60% of the ?*Mo
and about 30% of the !°%Ru are accounted for in
the salt. It is not possible to decide whether
these isotopes are present as colloidal particles
or are soluble chemical species.

Isotopes of tellurium and iodine are of interest
as xenon precursors and as elements which might
show appreciable volatility from the melt. Only
about 30% of the '3?Te appears in the salt, but
the expected quantities (90 to 100%) of the iodine
isotopes were found in the salt samples.

Analyses of the MSRE fuel samples do not,
therefore, seem surprising except for the low con-
centration of 132Te. Examination of graphite and
metal samples and, especially, of specimens from
the vapor phase as described in subsequent sec-
tions do show several surprises.

FISSION PRODUCTS IN MSRE EXIT GAS

Equilibrium Pressures of Noble-Metal Fluorides
Under MSRE Conditions

C. F. Baes, Jr.

As the following sections of this document de-
scribe in brief, volatile species of Mo, Te, Ru,
and (probably) Nb have been found in the helium
cover gas of the MSRE. In addition, sizable
fractions of these elements appear (presumably
as metal) on the metallic surfaces of the reactor.
Their unexpected behavior prompted a review of
the thermodynamic data on the volatile fluorides
of these elements and an assessment of their

equilibrium pressures under
MSRE conditions.

The formation free energies for NbF, MoF ,
and UF, may be calculated with relatively good
accuracy because of recent measurements at Ar-
gonne of the heats of formation of these com-
pounds by fluotine bomb calorimetry. ?—*% The
entropies and heat capacity data also are avail-
able. 3 While the people at Argonne have meas-
ured Ruf, '* no entropy or heat capacity data

Analysis for Fission Products in MSRE Exit Gas

S. S. Kirslis FI. F. Blankenship

The only gas-liquid interface in the MSRE (ex-
cept for the contact between liquid and the gas-
filled pores of the moderator graphite) exists in
the pump bowl. There a salt flow of about 60 gpm
(5% of the total system flow) contacts a helium
cover gas which flows through the bowl at 4
liters /min. Provisions for direct sampling of this
exit gas are planned but have not yet been in-
stalled in the MSRE.

Samples of the liquid fuel are obtained by low-
ering a sampler, on a stainless steel cable, through
this cover gas and into the liquid. It has been
possible, accordingly, to detect chemically active
fission product species in this cover gas by ra-
diochemical analysis of the stainless steel cable
and its accessories which contact only the gas
phase and by analysis of special getter materials
which are attached to the cable. Coils of silver
wire and specimens of Hastelloy N have generally
been used as getters for this puipose.

No quantitative measure of the isotopes present
in the gas phase is possible, since no good es-
timate can be made of the gas volume sampled.
The quantity of material deposited on the wire
specimen does not correlate” well with contact
time (in the range 1 to 10 min) or with the getter
materials studied.

The quantity of material deposited, however,
is relatively large. Table 4.3 indicates relative

Volatile species
of Mo, Te, and Ru must certainly be presumed
to exist in the gas phase. The iodine isotopes
show perceptibly different behavior. Iodine-135,
whose tellurium precursor has a short half-life,
does not appear, while '3! and 123, both of
which have tellurium precursors of appreciable
half-life, are found. These findings — along with
the fact that these iodine isotopes are present
in the salt at near their expected concentration —
suggest that any iodine in the vapor phase comes
as a result of volatilization of the tellurium pre-

Cursors.

Attempts to detect deposition of uranium (from
evolution of UF») on the wites have so far been
This fact ~ along with the failure
to find many of the fission products which have
no volatile compounds — rules out the possibility
that salt spray is responsible for these obser-

vations.

It seems most unlikely that these data can be
reconciled as equilibrium behavior of the volatile
It is possible that the MSRE metal is
plated with a noble-metal alloy whose thickness
is several hundred angstroms, and it is conceiv-
able that the UF ,/UF, ratio is near 10*. The

could show an appreciable pressure under these

UF ,/UF, ratios, and it seems most unlikely that
any single redox potential can yield the relative
abundance observed for these isotopes.

The following speculation may be relevant: As
the fission products, which originate in highly
electron-deficient states, thermalize and acquire
electrons in the melt, they pass through these
“unstable” but volatile valence conditions. If
the plated reactor metal is sufficiently unreactive
and if (as it seems to be at present) the MSRE
fuel is quite deficient in UF ,, it is conceivable
that some fraction of these materials might ap-
pear in the gas phase and enter the MSRE graphite
or leave the system in the exit gas. If this is
true, then a considerable increase in UF, con-
centration in MSRE fuel might well markedly de-
crease the fraction in the vapor phase. It is
clear that additional study will be required before
the situation becomes clear.

FISSION PRODUCTS ON METAL
AND GRAPHITE FROM MSRE CORE

S. S. Kirslis F. F. Blankenship

An assembly of MSRE graphite and Hastelloy N
specimens was exposed on the central stringer
within the MSRE core during its initial operation.
This assembly was removed during the July 17
shutdown after 7800 Mwhr of reactor operation,
and many specimens have been carefully examined.

No evidence of alteration of the graphite was
found under examination by visual, x-radiographic,
and metallographic examination. Autoradiographs
showed that penetration of radioactive materials
into the graphite was not uniform and disclosed
a thin (perhaps 1- to 2-mil) layer of highly radio-
active materials on or near the exposed graphite
surfaces. Examination of the metal specimen
showed no evidence of corrosion or other danger.

Rectangular bars of graphite from the top (out-
let), middle, and bottom (inlet) region of this
central stringer were milled in the hot cell to
remove six successive layers from each surface.
The removed layers were then analyzed for sev-
eral fission product isotopes. 17

The results of analysis of the outer layer from
the graphite specimen are shown in Table 4.4.

phe initial sampling was carried out by J. G. Morgan,
M. F. Osbome, and H. E. Robertson. Their help and
that of the Hot-Cell Operation Group is gratefully ac-
knowledged.

It is clear that, with the assumption of uniform
deposition on or in all the moderator graphite,
appreciable fractions of Mo, Te, and Ru and a
large fraction of the Nb are associated with the

be sufficient to exert significant poisoning in a

sors, can be accounted for in terms of laws of dif-

stantial fraction of the ruthenium seem to be so

carried into the specimen as its tellurium pre-

high, since those for the '*!Ce and !*%Ce with

xenon diffusion and the behavior of daughter ce-
sium born in the moderator graphite of an MSBR
operating under such conditions. A one-dimen-
sional steady-state diffusion model was assumed
in which the moderator was represented as a slab
of graphite infinite in two dimensions, with a
thickness of 1 cm, immersed ian the fuel salt.
It was further assumed that all cesium born in
the graphite was in the elemental (gaseous) form.
The parameters varied were: (1) the diffusion
coefficients I of xenon and cesium in the graphite
(assumed to be =qual), (2) the film coefficient H
associated with the salt-graphite interface, and
(3) the rate at which gas is stripped from the
fuel, Ag pr

Over the range chosen for these parameters,
the rate step in the diffusion of xenon into the
graphite was found to be at the salt-graphite in-
terface and was dependent on the value of H
(Fig. 4.4). As a consequence, a decrease in D
did not materially decrease the inward diffusion
of xenon; however, it did decrease the rate at
esium diffused to the graphite

Thus, somewhat paradoxically, the maximum par-
tial pressure of Cs? (at the center of the slab)
was found to increase as D was decreased.

Under all combinations of H, D, and Agr values
chosen, the calculated cesium partial pressure
at steady state was high enough to cause the
formation of lamellar cesium carbides (Fig. 4.4):

Cs %g) + nC(s) = CsC (5).

However, the calculated accumulation rate of Cs
was so low that the amounts of CsC_ which could
be formed did not appear to be significant.

Finally, these calculations indicate that in the
absence of iodine removal (i.e., 6.7-hr 35D), Xe
poisoning in a full-scale MSBR will be controlled
primarily by the film coefficient H (Fig. 4.4) and
will be difficult to reduce to an acceptable value
by gas stripping alone. It could be reduced more
effectively either by iodine removal or by some
means which effectively reduces the film coef-
ficient.

current (7) for anodic film growth on zirconium in
oxygenated, dilute H,30, at temperatures from
174 to 284°C is an exponential function of the
field strength, v,/X, across the oxide film. This

the need for two additional modifications to the

deviations from expected behavior at large film

Use of an additional constant in Eqs. (2) and

of the relation for anodic film growth, Equation
(2) was derived on the assumption that the fraction
of the total potential difference, from metal to

stant and independent of i.

In a more general
we take into account the possibility
that charge transport across each interface may
also affect the potential distribution. We have
therefore extended the formalism of the so-called
dual-barrier model? 7%? to a triple-barrier problem

and derived the rate expression of Eq. (4):

In Eq. (4), V=V, + V, + V, is the total potential
difference hetween metal and solution phases; it
equals the sum of V, (potential difference between
metal and oxide phases), v, (potential difference
across oxide layer), and V, (potential difference
between oxide and solution phases). The param-

eters k,, k,, and k, are the corresponding rate

AC IMPEDANCE OF OXIDE FILMS IN AQUEOUS
SOLUTIONS AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES

G. H. Jenks R. J. Davis
A. L. Bacarella H. S. Gadiyar'®

We are in the process of developing equipment,
methods, and techniques which will permit us to
measure the ac impedance of corrosion films on
zirconium and its alloys in aqueous solutions
at elevated temperatures. The immediate objec-
tive of these measurements is to determine whether
pores or fissures which admit aqueous solutions
occur in these films during corrosion at tempera-
tures up to about 300°C. If these determinations
can be made satisfactorily, we will then attempt
to conduct similar experiments in-pile. It is ex-
pected that valuable information on the electrical
properties of the high-temperature corrosion films
will be obtained also during the course of the
measurements.

In the method employed, the specimen is im-
mersed in an electrolyte which, together with the
metal container, comprises one electrode for im~
pedance measurements of the oxide film on the
specimen. The metal of the specimen is the second
electrode.
tance and resistance of the oxide over a range of

Measurements are made of the capaci-

frequencies and at two or more electrolyte concen-
trations. The results are examined for behavior
expected to result from penetration of the electro-
lyte into fissures within the oxide.

The principles upon which this method of pore
detection is based were discussed by Young.?®
Wanklyn and co-workers?®?7 have used ac im-
pedance measurements at room temperature in
studies of the protective and electrical properties
of oxide films formed on zirconium alloys during
high-temperature corrosion.

Our measurements to date have covered a tem-
perature range of 25 to 200°C and have been made
on a single zirconium specimen bearing a 1500-A
film formed anodically (0.0 v vs Pt at 55°C) in
oxygenated 0.05 m H,SO, at 220 to 230°C in the

measurements was oxygenated 0.05 m H,SO,.
For a subsequent series {25, 50, 100, and 150°C),
the electrolyte was oxygenated 0.05 m X,SO,.

The impedance cell was made up of a small
Zircaloy-2 autoclave containing an insulated gold
cup 7 in. in inside diameter x Y in. long, which
held the electrolyte. The 0.2-cm rod-shaped speci-
men was positioned slong the axis of the cup and
protruded into the gas-steam phase. The bottom
end of the specimen was covered and sealed with
Teflon, so that only the axial surfaces were in
with the electrolyte. Electrical leads
from the specimen, gold cup, and from a small
platinum reference electrode which dipped into the
electrolyte were passed the gas-steam

contact

through
phase and out of the autoclave through a Teflon
seal. In operation, gas (O,-He) pressurization
was used to prevent gas-bubble formation within
the electrolyte of the gold cup. This was ac-
complished by adjusting the pressure upward as
the temperature was raised, so that the pressure
of dissolved gas never exceeded the overpressure.
A General Radio 1615-A bridge with three terminal
connections was employed in impedance measure-
ments.

The results of series capacitance measurements
on the single specimen over a range of tempera-
tures and frequencies are illustrated in Fig. 5.3.
The slopes of these straight lines are listed in
Table 5.1. The results of the corresponding
series resistance measurements for the film fell
near straight lines in plots of R_ vs 1/f. These
lines passed through the origin after correction
for the electrolyte The slopes of
the lines in these data plots are also listed in
Table 5.1.

Young derived these equations by employing a
mode! in which the resistivity, p, varies exponen-
tially with distance through the oxide. The re-
sistivities at the opposite surfaces of the oxide
of thickness d are p(0) and p(d) respectively; ¢ is
the dielectric constant and A is the area. These
equations reproduced Young’s experimental re-
sults for anodic films on Nb with respect to straight-
line formation in plots of 1/C_ vs log f and of R
vs 1/f and with respect to the relationship between
the slopes of the 1/C_ and Rg plots.?® The fre-
quency dependencies of C_ and R_ observed by
others for anodic and corrosion films on Zr have
been ascribed to conductivity gradients through
the oxide. ?”

are given below. Results concerning the corrosion
of the aluminum-clad HFIR fuel elements have
been reported previously’! and are not included
here.

The HFIR, which is presently operating at the
design power of 100 Mw, uses water adjusted to a
pH of 5.0 with nitric acid as coolant; all tests
were conducted in this environment at 100°C.
Aluminum alloys (6061, 1100, and X-8001) cor-
roded at rates of 0.2 mil/year or less at all flow
rates up to 81 fps. Contacting aluminum with
aluminum, beryllium, nickel, or stainless steel
resulted in pitting of the aluminum in contact
areas only. The pits were of appreciable depth,
but they were randomly spread and should not be
of major consequence in the HFIR system. At
velocities of 13 to 81 fps, beryllium corroded at
a constant rate of 2 mils/year and showed only a
slight tendency to pit. Corrosion damage to the
beryllium reflector in the HFIR should be negligibly
small. Both nickel and electroless nickel de-
posits corroded excessively in the acidified water
and are not usable in the HFIR. ¥lectrolyzed
coatings (a proprietary process for coating ma-
terials with chromium) on stainless steel exhibited
excellent corrosion resistance and good adherence
to stainless steel. Similar deposits flaked and
peeled from aluminum surfaces. Hardened types
416 and 420 stainless steel were shown to be un-
suitable; the former alloy blistered, and the latter
underwent stress-corrosion cracking.

The primary areas of concern in the AARR were
the beryllium reflector, the 6061-T6 aluminum

that the corrosion rate of the beryllium reflector
in the AARR will be between 1 and 3 mils/year
with a minimum of localized attack.

The coriosion of 6061-T6
results in the formation of an insulating layer of

There is relatively little information available
on the properties of aqueous electrolyte solutions
at supercritical temperatures and pressures. The
simplest and most direct method for obtaining

NaCl appears to be independent of temperature
(at constant density), Although the values at
800°C are slightly below the 400 to 700°C values,
this difference is mostly a consequence of in-
creasing jon-pair formation at higher temperatures,
As NaCl becomes a weaker electrolyte, the extrap-
olated limiting equivalent conductances become
somewhat uncertain and tend to fall below their
true values, These solutions showed this behavior
at densities below 0.4 g/cm® and at temperatures
above 700°C, Dissociation constants for ion-pair
formation in NaCl solutions were calculated from
the Shedlovsky equation® at densities from 0.3
to 0.75 g/cm® and temperatures from 400 to 800°C.

Figure 6.2 shows the dependence of the logarithm
of these dissociation constants on the logarithm
of the density of the solution at the several
temperatures.

An extensive series of measurements were made
using 0.01 demal (0.01 mole per 1000 g of solution)
KCl solutions. As was mentioned previously, a
KCl solution of this concentration appears to be
the logical choice as a reference for conductance
measurements at elevated temperatures and pres-
sures, since it is used as a standard solution for
cell constant determinations at 25°C. Accordingly,
many measurements have been made in this Lab-
oratory over a period of several years on 0.01
demal KCl solutions. Some of the results are
shovm in Fig. 6.3, where the specific conductances
are plotted as a function of temperature at a con-
stant pressure of 4000 bars. This graph represents
the results of 50 separate runs, using three con-
ductance cells and seven different inner electrode
assemblies.

A comprehensive investigation of the electrical
conductances of alkali metal halide solutions and
solutions of related compounds was initiated and
is presently nearing completion. Measurements
have been completed from 0 to 800°C and to 4000
bars on 0.01 m solutions of the following electro-
lytes: NaCl, NaBr, Nal, KCI, KBr, KI, RbF, RbCl,
RbBr, Rbl, CsCl, CsBr, CsI, NH Br, (CH) NBr,

ber at 25°C. In this Division, values above 100°C
have been obtained from conductance® and sol-
ubility measurements.” Any contribution to the
equilibrium behavior of electrolytes at high tem-
perature, especially the behavior of 2-2 electro-
Iytes, is of very much fundamental and applied
interest. The equilibrium of considerable interest
to the high-temperature behavior of seawater and
other saline waters is the dissociation equilibrium

calcium sulfate (or its hydrates) in seawater con-

sodium chloride solutions, and with the assumption
that this increase is due predominantly to the
formation of the magnesium sulfate complex, dis-

DISSOCIATION CONSTANT OF CALCIUM
SULFATE TO 350°C OBTAINED FROM
SOLUBILITY BEHAVIOR IN MIXED
ELECTROLYTES?

L. B. Yeatts W. L. Marshall

The dissociation quotients, Q , for Caso? were
determined from extensive solubility measurements
of calcium sulfate (or the dihydrate at 25°) in an
aqueous system of mixed electrolytes, varying from
pure NaNO, to pure Na SO, when possible. Mea-
surements were made at several constant ionic
strengths from 0.25 to 6 m at 25, 150, 250, and
350°C.

When solid calcium sulfate dissolves in aqueous
solutions, it may be assumed that an equilibrium
is reached with undissociated molecules:

CaSO (s)&==>CaS0,%aq) 9)
which at saturation can be expressed by
Q, = [CasS0,°] (molal units) . (10)
69

The neutral species can be considered also to
undergo partial dissociation:

CaSO, (ag) ==Ca’" (aq) + SO,’ (aq) , (11)

in which case the equilibrium quotient expression
is
Q, = [ca®1[s0,~1/[Cas0,’] (molal units) . (12)

The solubility product quotient in this study was
then defined as

= [Cn 2t 2-7
Q,, = [Ca™](s0,*71- 0,0, . (13)
With these assumptions, the molal solubility of
calcium sulfate, s, at various ionic strengths and
temperatures can be expressed by

s = [Cas0, 1+ [ca™]. (14)
Since
[ca®'] = 0, /150,%"] (15)
and
[S0,27) = total sulfate — {CaSO ,°]
=[s0,],, ~ [cas0,%, (16)
then
s=1[Cas0,°1+ Q_ /([s0,] , ~[CasO.%). (17)

A plot of values of s vs 1/180, — [caso,’]),
with the assumption of constancy (or near con-
stancy) of activity coefficients at constant ionic
strength, should yield a straight line of slope Qg
and intercept (Cas0,°l. The results obtained at
25°C at constant ionic strengths of 0.25, 0.5, 1,
2, and 6 m, at 150°C at 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 6 m, at
250°C at 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 6 m, and at 350°C at 1
and 6 m were treated by a method of least squares
to yield values for Qu Ospr and [Cas0,%] for each
set of measurements, As examples, data at 25°C,
and a representative series at I = 1 from 150 to
350°C, so treated are shown in Figs. 6.6 and 6.7;
the solubilities are observed to be a linear function
of 1/80 14, — [Cas0,%D within the precision of
the measurements.

In order to determine whether the above linear
relationships were an artifact of Harned’s rule,
values of the logarithm of the analytical solubility
product, m(total calcium) «m(total sulfate), were
plotted against the molality of added sulfate at
constant ionic strength. Harned’s rule would be
expected to yield a linear relationship if the plot
were made at constant molality (which for 1-1
electrolyte would be

strength). The plots were not linear nor were they

mixtures constant ionic
linear by estimating the nature of the plots at
constant molality.

The values of Q4 Usp and Q obtained at the
several constant ionic strengths and temperatures
were extrapolated to zero ionic strengths to yield
dissociation constants for Caso”, values for
solubility product constants, and K?. When the
previously obtained !® values of K? were corrected
for neutral Caso,” relatively good

agreement (within ~10%) between the two sets of

previously reported 2? have been extended in tem-

The method used was essentially the same as
before. An HCI solution in a reservoir of Pyrex
glass was equilibrated at room temperature with

H, at a pressure of 1.0 atm. Then it was pumped

through a pressurized heated column of the spe-
cially prepared Fe O,. The equilibrated solution
was cooled and then passed through a cation ex-
changer to strip out the dissolved iron. The iron
was later eluted and analyzed spectrochemically
by means of o-phenanthroline.

After obtaining most of the data reported here,
we modified the system for eventual use of alkaline
solutions. A copper reservoir was substituted for
the glass one, and provision was made for injecting
an HCI solution into the stream of hot equilibrated
solution to prevent precipitation of dissolved iron
on cooling.

The data are shown in Fig. 6.8, where the log-
arithm of the iron concentration is plotted against
the C17 concentration obtained from the electrolytic
conductivity of the makeup solution. The lines on
the graph have been calculated on the basis of
iron being in solution as the two ions, Fe?" and

Using trial values of these products at each tem-

point, and the known ionization constant of H,0, 21
we calculated the H' concentration that gave a
charge neutrality for the ionic species at the ex-
periment temperature. The logarithm of the corre-
sponding concentration of iron was then compared
with the experimental value. After treating all the
data this way, a least-squares procedure was used
to adjust the solubility products to values that
minimized the differences between calculated and
observed iron concentrations. These constants,
which include the effective H, pressure as cal-
culated from the solubility data of Gilpatrick and

Stone, 22 are given below:

These calculated solubility products indicate that
the fraction of iron in the Fe?" form was 100% at
200° 15% or less at 260° and 55 to 85% at 300°
The apparent change in the signs of the tempera-
ture coefficients of the solubility products over
this temperature range is of interest, as this is
in the same temperature range where the dissocia-
tion constant of water goes through a maximum.

HYDROLYSIS OF BERYLLIUM ION IN 1.0 4
CHLORIDE AT 25°C

R. E. Mesmer C. F. Baes, Jr.

The aqueous chemistry of Be(Il) solutions is not
yet satisfactorily defined. There have been a
great number of studies on the hydrolysis of beryl-
lium beginning with the work of Prytz?3 in 1929.
Probably the most authorative studies are those
coming from Sillén’s school in Stockholm since
1956. 2427 These workers favor a scheme of three
species to explain potentiometric data below 1 ¥
beryllium concentration in acidic perchlorate
media, that is, Be (OH)**, Be ,(OH),*", and
Be(OH) ,. many other
schemes have been proposed which were not sup-
ported by the work of Sillén and his co-workers.

The neutral species Be(OH), is the least accept-
able of those in the above scheme. The existence

of such a species implies a lower limit for the

A
cursory examination of the data in ref. 24 indicates
that comparable or better fits to the data are ob-
tained with the scheme Be (OH),*", Be (OM) **,
and Be (OH), >" as well as other schemes con-
taining Be ,(OH),*". The logarithm for the sta-

region 2 to 7 and at beryllium concentrations be-
tween 0.001 and 0.05 m using quinhydrone and
calomel electrodes. The factors limiting the pl or
hydroxide-to-metal concentration ratios which can
be attained are the equilibration rate and the
solubility. equilibrium

Generally, ratios up to

about 1.1 were achieved without precipitation
within 1 hr.

Analysis of our data at 25° indicates that no
pair of species with up to five metal ions or hy-
droxide ions per species is sufficient to explain
the data within experimental error. Least-squares
calculations for 33 pairs led to this conclusion.
The schemes involving three or more species have
not yet been examined in detail. However, pre-
liminary results indicate that a polynuclear species
is more suitable than Be(OH),.

As Kakihana and S$illén** have pointed out, the
presence of the species Be(CH), leads to an inter-
section of all mn vs pH curves at A of 1.0 and
pH ca. 5.5. Clearly such an intersection is absent
in the data shown in Fig. 6.9. This observation
is consistent with data reported in 1965 by Bertin
et al.,?® although these investigators also chose
to interpret their data in terms of Be(OH), as
suggested earlier by Sillén.

In order to better define the most representative
hydrolysis scheme, similar studies are being con-

ducted at higher temperatures.

these parameters for outgassing temperatures rang-
ing from 25 to 500°C. The samples were main-
tained at a pressure less than 107° torr for 24 hr
at each temperature, prior to sealing under vacuum.
Each point represents the mean of at least lwo
experimental determinations. The calorimetric and
associated techniques have been described previ-
ously. ?

As observed earlier,? the materials from the
lower-temperature calcination liberated a portion
of the heat slowly after an initial instantaneous
burst of heat. The slow heat effects for the
650 and 800°C calcined thoria are best character-
ized as two concurrent first-order processes: a
slow heat effect with a half-life of ca. 4 min and
a very slow heat with a half-life of ca. 40 min.
The 1000°C calcined thoria exhibited only one
slow process (half-life of ca. 12 min) in addition
to the instantaneous process. The higher cal-
cination temperatures (1200 to 1600°C) produce
materials which release all the immersional heat
instantaneously, with no detectable slow processes
present.

The heat of immersion at any given outgassing
temperature shows an increase with increasing
crystallite size (decreasing specific surface area)
for the lowest-fired materials, followed by a de-
crease to an essentially constant value for the
larger crystallites. The variation of the heats of
immersion with respect to crystallite size is not
well understood and has been the object of inves-
tigations with other oxides, as reviewed recently
by Zettlemoyer.® The invariance of the immer-
sional heat per unit area for our larger crystallites
suggests that these values may be tly repre-
sentative of an ‘‘ideal”’ thoria surface, with some
sort of perturbations present for the smaller crys-
tallites.
cation from other techniques that will allow con-
struction of a creditable model. The inversion
of the data for the 300°C-outgassed, 1000°C-
calcined material is probably due to experimental
error, with the heat of immersion being 850 + 20
ergs/em? for 300 to 500°C outgassing of this
material.

In an attempt to see if the aforementioned be-
havior is the result of the oxalate preparation of

prepared by the steam denitration of thorium nitrate.
The low-fired, high-surface-area materials also

the higher-fired materials.

Adsorption of Water and Nitrogen on Porous
and Nonporous Theria

H. F. Holmes ££. L. Fuller, Jr.

Previous calorimetric>'* and gravimetric® inves-
tigations of the interaction of water with the sur-
face of thoria have revealed the very complex
nature of this process. Material used in the pre-
vious work consisted entirely of porous thoria
derived from the oxalate. Two samples of compa-
rable surface area were used in the present work.
Sample C is a typical oxalate material, while
sample S was prepared in an attempt to minimize
the intemal surface, that is,
rosity. ®7

The porous and nonporous character of samples
C and S, respectively, are clearly revealed from
the typical adsorption isotherms shown in Figs.
7.2 and 7.3. Inflections in the desorption branch
for sample C at a relative pressure of about 0.35
indicate pore sizes ranging down to about 10 A in
radius. ‘The nonporous character of sample S is
further confirmed by the fact that the x-ray crys-
tallite size is compatible with the nitrogen suc-
face area. However, both samples exhibited the
low-pressure hysteresis and irreversible retention
of water discussed previously.’ The quantities
of irreversibly adsorbed water listed in Table 7.1
are much greater than would be required to form
a single layer of surface hydroxyl groups. On the
basis of the present results, it is concluded that
the irreversible retention of water in such large

decrease the po-

quantities is not a unique property of porous mate-
rial. The phenomenon has been described’ as an
immobile association adsorption to give the surface
analog of a hydrated bulk hydroxide.

Application of the BET theory to the water iso-
therms yields interesting information concerning
the apparent surface areas. The data for sample C
indicate that the effective surface area decreases
with increasing amounts of irreversibly adsorbed
water. Ultimately the effective surface area de-
creased to about 75% of the area determined by
nitrogen after outgassing at 500°C. This is not
unexpected, since chemisorbed water should de-
crease the total pore volume, in the
case of the nonporous sample §S, the effective
surface area decreased to about 40% of the original

of water adsorbed at the higher relative pressures
indicated an effective surface area roughly equal
to the original nitrogen surface area. Surfac:
areas were calculated from the water data on the
assumption of a liquid-like monolayer, that is,
each molecule occupies 10.6 AZ Tentatively,
the anomaly with sample S can be explained by
assuming that each water molecule in the first
physically adsorbed layer is hydrogen bonded to
two underlying chemisorbed water molecules. Cal-
culations based on this assumption give surface
areas which are much more compatible with the
nitrogen surface areas.

Results from the nitrogen adsorption experiments
are summarized in Table 7.1, which gives the
BET parameters obtained from the isotherms. It
is evident that increasing amounts of irreversibly
adsorbed water decrease both the measured nitro-
gen surface area and the BET C constant. A
decreasing value of C implies a smaller average
heat of adsorption in the first monolayer, a less
sharp ‘‘knee’’ of the isotherm, and that higher
pressures are required to fill the first statistical
monolayer. Decreasing nitrogen surface areas
for sample C, like those obtained from the water,
can perhaps be explained on the basis of the chem-
isorbed water decreasing the pore volume. This
concept cannot, however, explain the decreasing
nitrogen surface areas observed with sample S.
Explanations for the effect of chemisorbed water
on the nitrogen surface areas of sample S are, at
best, tentative. The effect of the magnitude of
the BET C constant and of the substrate lattice
on the area occupied by a nitrogen molecule is
currently being investigated.

Infrared Spectra of Adsorbed Species on Thoria

C. S. Shoup, Jr.

Infrared spectral studies of adsorbed species on
thorium oxide have continued with higher outgas-
sing temperatures than were previously attainable. ®
Initial room-temperature outgassing of a pressed
disk of ThO, which had been calcined in air at
650° (see Fig. 7.1) produced a prominent absorp-
tion band at 3740 cm™!, attributed to unperturbed
surface hydroxyl groups, and a band at 3660 cm ™!.
In addition, a dramatic reduction in the intensity
and increase in the frequency at maximum absorb-
ance of a broad band due to the stretching mode
of hydrogen-bonded OH groups occurred. In con-
trast to most other oxides, 7' 1? however, increasing
the outgassing temperature above 100° reduced
the intensity of the band at 3740 cm™'. After
outgassing at 500° this band had virtually dis-

appeared, leaving a doublet at 3645 to 3660 cm™!

and a weaker band at 3520 cm™! superimposed
on a weak, broad contour, indicating some residual
polymeric hydrogen bonding.

Although this thoria had previously been calcined
in air at only 650° the sample was nevertheless
outgassed at increasingly higher temperatures,
thus producing some sintering action. !? Outgas-
sing at 650° left only weak bands in the OH stretch-
ing region at 3656 and 3503 cm™!. No surface
hydroxyl groups were spectroscopically evident
after outgassing at 800° but other bands in the
1200 to 1700 em! region were present. These
latter bands disappeared after outgassing at 950°,
However, bands at 1040 and about 730 em™! were
very little affected by the outgassing treatment,
and their intensities were hardly reduced after
in vacuo sintering at 950° Examination of other
samples of ThO, indicated that these bands were
properties of the total mass, either as thorium
oxide or bulk impurities.

The discoloration of Tho, which has been ob-
served often after outgassing at 500° % has been
shown to be due to the presence of a small amount
of carbon residue from organic contamination de-
posited ducing the initial outgassing steps (indi-
cated by the presence of carbon-hydrogen stretch-
ing bands in the 2850 to 3000 cn! region). This
carbon residue can be removed by oxidation at
400°, with an accompanying weight loss, or by
volatilization at 900 to 1000°° [an the absence
of prior organic contamination, heating to 500° in
vacuo produced no discoloration. The fact that
the infrared spectra and the energetics of water
adsorption? were independent of color and oxygen
treatment (in contrast to rutile?) indicates that
oxygen defects, as proposed elsewhere, '? do not
play an important role in the discoloration of thoria.

In the presence of pure water vapor at a relative
humidity of 60%, the H-O-H deformation mode of
physically adsorbed H,O at 1630 em! was the
only absorption band to appear (except in the OH
stretching region) that was not present after out-
gassing at 950° After room-temperature evacu-
ation, a brief exposure of the thoria to the labora-
tory atmosphere at 40% relative humidity produced

"After 24 hr each at 650, 800, and 950° in vacuo, the
specific surface area was reduced to 12.3 m2/g and the
average crystallite size was increased to 319 A.

in addition to those present before the ThO, was

this that atmospheric catbon dioxide is rapidly and
strongly adsorbed on thoria, at least in the pres-
ence of water vapor.

BEHAVIOR OF GASES WITH SOL.GEL
URANIUM. THORIUM OXIDE FUELS

D. N. Hess

C. F. Weaver

Sol-gel microspheres of ThO, or UO, have been
found to evolve gases when heated, as did the
thoria—3% UO, sol-gel materials previously re-

d. 131% Efforts have been made to remove

porte
these gases, as well as the carbon, which are
generated by interaction and pyrolysis of the water,
nitrates, organic solvents, and surfactants included
in the sol-gel materials during their preparation.
Such removal is considered desirahle because ex-
cess gas pressure or reactions between the gas
and metal might occur in sealed fuel elements,
causing rupture during reactor operation.

The air-dried ThO, microspheres yielded CO,,
CO, H,, NO, N,, and organics upon heating in

vacuum. The first three were dominant. ‘The

largest amount of gas evolution occurred at the
following centigrade temperature intervals: 240
to 260, 400 to 460, and 700 to 760. Above 760°C,
only a negligible amount of gas remained.

The wet UO, microspheres yielded CO,, CO,
H,, N,, 0, NO, and organics when heated with
steam and evacuated. The temperature intervals
of maximum gas evolution appear to be 150 to
250°C and 400 to 650°C. The principal gas
evolved (primarily in the 300 to 350° range) was
CH,. This is in direct contrast with the production
of higher-molecular-weight organic products previ-
ously noted in the case of the ThO, microspheres.

A possible explanation? for the difference is
that in dry ThO, catalytic cracking of the included
organics occurs, while in the wet Uo, matrix
thermal cracking is dominant. The latter case is
expected to produce lower-molecular-weight prod-
ucts.

A conditioning scheme, successful with respect
to producing a low carbon content, a low O:U
ratio, and high density, is shown in detail in Table
7.2. The flow of water vapor was necessary for
the removal of carbonaceous material and, thus,
for production of a low final concentration of car-
bon in the UO, microspheres. The water vapor
also seems to prevent fragmentation of the spheres.

The mixture of CO, and H,0 was superior to
either compound separately for increasing the rate
of sintering. It was of prime importance that the
carbon removal be complete before the mixture of
Co, and H,0 was added, since the densification
step trapped any remaining carbonaceous material.
The final use of pure H, to counter the oxidizing

TRANSPORT PROPERTIES OF GASES

Gaseous Diffusion Studies in Noble-Gas Systems

A. P. Malinauskas

Gaseous diffusion experiments have been con-
ducted with the gas pairs He-Kr, Ar-Kr, and Kr-Xe
over the temperature range 0 to 120°C to provide
additional data for use in an investigation of the in-
teraction characteristics of noble-gas molecules.
This work represents the second phase of a sys-
tematic study of the binary diffusion process in
systems involving all possible combinations of
the noble gases. ? The third part of this research,
involving the systems He-Ne, Ne-Ar, Ne-Kr, and
Ne-Xe, is in progress.

All the diffusion data available concerning the
systems He-Kr, Ar-Kr, and Kr-Xe are graphically
summarized in Figs. 8.1 to 8.3, where the dif-
fusion coefficient D. ., at 1 atm pressure, is
plotted as a function of the absolute temperature
T. The solid lines in the figures have been con-
structed using the usual Chapman-Enskog ex-
pression for the diffusion coefficient,3 in which
the Lennard-Jones (12-6) potential energy pa-
rameters presented in Table 8.1 have been em-
ployed. These parameters yield the best repre-
sentation of the experimental data; they likewise
give favorable agreement with diffusion coefficient
values deduced from measurements of the com-
position dependence of the viscosities of the cor-

Gaseous Diffusion in Porous Media

A. P. Malinauskas R. B. Evans III
E. A. Mason ®

A generalized treatment of gas transport in porous
media has been realized; as a result, it is now
possible to account for a variety of phenomena
involving gas transport from a single viewpoint
having a sound theoretical foundation. 7

The treatment has been developed on the basis
of the ‘‘dusty-gas’® model, a model in which a
porous septum is described as consisting of uni-
formly distributed giant molecules (dust) held
Although this description
is not as palatable as the more common ‘‘bundle
of capillaries’ concept, it does possess two dis-
tinct advantages from a mathematical standpoint.
First, the geometrical part of the problem neatly
separates from that part which deals with the
dynamics of the gas transport. Second, the im-

portance of gas-surface
gas-gas ianteractions is
In other words, it is unnecessary to postulate
one mechanism for free-molecule conditions and
another for hydrodynamic transport and then at-
tempt to reconcile the two in the transition region;
the validity of the dusty-gas model applies through-
out. Moreover, the results are likewise applicable
to describe gas transport through capillaries simply
by a suitable substitution for geometric parameters.

The following brief summary indicates the num-
ber of phenomena which have been described as
special forms of the general case (some of these
have been presented previously). ®

Binary Gaseous Diffusion at Uniform Temper
ature ond Pressure. — This phenomenon is treated
as three-component diffusion in terms of the dusty-
gas model; the most notable result is a theoretical
formulation for the observation that the ratio of
the fluxes of the two diffusing pases is approxi-
mately inversely proportional to the square roots
of their molecular weights, not only under con-
ditions of free-molecule transport but in the region

of hydrodynamic transport as well. Parenthetically,
this observation appears to have been made first
by Graham in 1833, but has either become for-
gotton or confused with his work on effusion
(transport into a vacuum), which was done about
13 years later.

Isothermal Transport in the Presence of a Pres-
sure Gradient. — When only a single gas is con-
sidered, the mathematical expression which results
from an application of the model represents an
analogous form of Poiseuille’s flow equation with
viscous slip. However, the viscous part arises
from Stokes’ law, whereas the slip term is de-
veloped from a consideration of pure gas diffusion
in a static dust environment. Moreover, the
Knudsen minimum, which has yet to be rigorously
described utilizing the capillary concept, is sat-
isfactorily taken into account by considering the
next-higher to the diffusion co-
efficient.

approximation

Whether a pure gas or a binary gas mixture is
considered, it turns out that it is possible to
separate (mentally) the viscous flow contribution
from that due lo diffusive transport; but in the
latter case the equations remain coupled through
the composition dependence of the characteristic
transport coefficients. Consequently, few sit-
uations can be conveniently handled without re-
course to numerical methods. One of these is
known as the Kramer-Kistemaker effect, wherein
a pressure gradient develops in a closed system
because of diffusion. In this instance the equation
derived from the dusty-gas concept appears to
be the first description of the phenomenon that
is applicable at all pressures.

Pure Gas Transport Under the Combined influ-
ence of Gradients of Pressure and Temperature. —
This phenomenon is known as thermal transpi-
ration or the thermomolecular pressure difference.
Prior to the application of the dusty-gas model,
the effect was primarily investigated only be-
causa of its influence on accurate pressure meas-
urement. As stated in the section ‘Thermal
Transpiration,” the phenomenon now appears to
provide a particularly simple approach to an in-
vestigation of inelastic collisions.

Binary Gas Transport Under MNonuniform Tem-
perature and Pressure Conditions. — All the pre-
vious items represent special cases of this rather
complex situation, and only two aspects of the
problem have been considered in detail. The
first of these is the presswe difference, at steady-
state conditions, which is produced in a binary
gas mixture under the influence of a temperature
gradient, without regard for variations in com-
position; the resultant expression describes thermal
transpiration in a binary gas mixture.

The second case also concerns a steady-state
solution; the problem considered is the relative
separation produced in a binary gas mixture as
the result of a temperature gradient, without re-
gard for pressure variations. The expression
derived for this case describes the variation of
the thermal diffusion factor with pressure, as one
proceeds from the free-molecule
region of hydrodynamic transport.

It is interesting to note that in neither of these
last two cases does there appear to be any ex-
perimental data with which the theoretical re-

region to the

lationships may be verified.

Gas Transport Studies Related to Vented
Fue! Elements for Fast Gas-Cooled Reactors

R. B. Evans III D. E. Bruins®

Tentative reference designs for a 2500-Mw (ther-
mal) fast-flux helium-cooled reactor call for utili-
zation of fuel pins comprising (U,Pu)O, bushings
stacked in free-standing stainless steel cladding.
Requirements for high power densities demand
very high fuel temperatures, close pin spacing,
and minimum cladding wall thickness. One might
envision 0.38-in.-OD claddings (0.010-in. walls)
containing 6-ft sections of 80% effective density
Cladding temperature will be 815°C at
steady-state conditions; helium coolant pressure
will be about 1000 psi.

If, for any reason, the coolant pressure exceeds
the internal pin pressure by 200 psi at 815°C,

the claddings might collapse. A means for pres-
sure equalization is clearly needed. In the present
investigation the possibility of using direct vent-
ing devices!® to ensure pressure equalization
is being examined under the realization that direct
vents pose special problems regarding fission

product release and coolant contamination.

We have elected to initiate our work by giving
first consideration to the release problems and
means for their mitigation. This approach was
adopted to take advantage of the only established
criterion available for studies of this type, namely,
the maximum allowable release-to-birth ratio, R/B,
of fission products as legislated in the PBRE!!
fuel specifications, modified to account for zero
retention by fuel! at fast flux reactor tempera-
tures. '? The reference criterion turns out to be
a constant R/B of 1.8 x 10~2 for all fission prod-
ucts.

Venting efficiencies have been left as somewhat
of a dependent variable because, once a suitable
venting device has been contrived, dimensioned,
and evaluated, venting capabilities as well as
inherent limitations can be determined. Under
this approach we need not be concerned (for the
time being) with rather nebulous considerations
that might govern venting criteria in the future,
for example, *‘maximum credible’’ coolant pressure
and/or fuel-temperature excursions.

In summary, we seek selective venting devices,
materials, or configurations that can discriminate
gradients in total pressure and partial pressures;
thus forced-coolant flow admittances will be high
when Ap # 0, and diffusive-flow admittances will
be low when Ap = 0. Both laboratory and desk
studies have been initiated to obtain the ob-
jectives cited above.

satisfy the condition dn,/dR = 0, and n, must be
the same for all beams. Along these lines we

This factor is required to

Therefore
the experimental plot of Fig. 8.4 is also a plot
of the distribution as it would occur in a coating,
diffusion and densification neglected.

For the case of porous carbons and graphites,
we find that Fg. (6) does not give a good fit of
experimental data plots. Obviously, the normal
r-space distribution does not hold, because well-
collimated beams would ‘‘see’’ density variations
in porous targets. The probability for stopping
f(r) dr about a mean R would not be symmetrical,
as it is for a normal distribution. In terms of
bulk volume most of the matrices of our porous
targets are composed of solids (open porosities
range from 10 to 20 vol %), and the most probable
range r, should correspond to a ‘‘low’’ value
which might be predicted using a ‘“‘high’’ porosity-
corrected density. Thus, on the rspace distri-
bution, r_ should reside to the left of the average
{r) or R, while portions of the curve to the right
of R should ‘‘tail out’”’ slowly to account for
fragments that encountered nonstopping regions

(pores).

Several skewed distribution functions were tested
for applicability to this problem; the most suc-
cessful candidate appears to be that shown in
Fig. 8.4 for porous targets. This function is
simply Maxwell's speed distribution for gases with
v/v replaced by r/r_..

When the Maxwellian distribution is subjected
to the same manipulations employed to develop
Eq. (6), one finds that

exactly. As before, the F.R. function also rep-

resents the f(z) distribution in coatings. Typical
porous target data are shown on the right side
of Fig. 85. The solid line represents a plot of
Eq. (7), and the dotted line represents a plot of
Eq. (6), which clearly does not apply.

Average range values for porous targets appear
in Table 8.2. Values for two of the porous ma-
terials show good agreement with ideal values.
Range values for the very porous graphite are
somewhat high; however, a large fraction of the
pores in this material were several times greater
than R. Our original intentions were to use these
data to establish an upper limit on pore sizes,
and in this respect the experiments failed because
Eq. (7) was followed (except at large z/R) and
the ranges were only slightly greater than the
ideal values.

In summary, we have found that effects of po-
rosity and variations in n, can be taken into ac-
count through a proper selection of the primitive
r-space distribution function. When this is ac-

91

complished, the mean range for porous targets
should be approximately the same as those ob-
served or predicted for homogeneous (ideal) ma-
terials. Specific details concerning porosity char-
acteristics are of little importance, if the pores
are not too large or well connected, because the
range correlation depends only on the bulk den-
sity and/or total porosity. Finally, we note that
straggling factors, as given by the theory, are of
little consequence with respect to the present
investigation.

OXIDATION OF GRAPHITE SLEEVES BY STEAM

C. M. Blood G. M. Hebert

Leakage of steam into the coolant circuit of
an HTGR having coated fuel particles and graphite
structural elements in the core could result in
damage to the fuel coatings and graphite com-
ponents due to extensive oxidation if appreciable
partial pressures of steam were present during
the period in which the core components were at
high temperatures. At this time, such parameters
as partial pressure of steam and temperature of
the various core components under accident condi-
tions cannot be precisely defined. Consequently

the steam-graphite reaction must be examined
experimentally using fairly wide ranges of tem-
peratures and parfial pressures of steam in an
attempt to cover the abnormal conditions which
may prevail. Some fission products catalyze the
oxidation of graphite, and if such products have
moved from the fuel particle to the adjacent
graphite abnormal reaction rates may be expected.
The
trolled at very high reaction rates resulting from

excessively high temperatures or strong catalysis

reaction also may be mass transport con-

at lower temperatures.

The oxidation of AT] graphite spheres by steam
was studied previously.! More recently, AT]J
graphite sleeves have been oxidized at 1000°C
using a helium-steam mixture having a partial
pressure of ~250 torrs and a total pressure of
1 atm. Mullite reaction tubes and quartz deposition
tubes used in these studies have been replaced
recently with alumina tubes, and studies now are
being performed in the temperature range of 1100

to 1500°C. Graphite sleeves (1%, -in.-OD, Ye

These dimensions approximated those of graphite

Graphite sleeves (2 in. long) were impregnated
with barium using 13°BaCl, and Ba(OH), solution,
drying the impregnated specimen at ~125°C, and
finally heat-treating in diy helium at 800 or 1000°C
for various periods of time. Sectioning and count-
ing of impregnated specimens are incomplete, but
preliminary measurements suggest that the treated
specimens contained ~0.1 wt % of barium and that
the barium was not uniformly distributed through
the graphite. One specimen of graphite previously
irradiated in loop 1, experiment 14 (ref. 2) was
oxidized and examined for transport of fission
products.

resolve this question.

The studies are continuing with emphasis being
placed on the effect of higher temperatures (1100
to 1500°C) on the steam-graphite system.

TRANSPORT OF FISSION PRODUCTS
C. M. Blood

Quartz deposition tubes were used in the runs
in which the barium-impregnated and the previously

irradiated graphite sleeves were oxidized by
steam, as well as during the prior heat treatment
of the impregnated sleeves in dry helinm. These
tubes were utilized to determine any movement
of barium downstream from the impregnated spec-
imens in wet or dry helium and (in the case of
previously irradiated graphite specimens) to cap-
ture any fission products transported by wet
helium. A number of the deposition tubes have
been sectioned by cutting into 1.5-cm lengths,
and the gamma activity due to '*°Ba has been
measured in each section.

Studies using graphite sleeves impregnated with
13385 and subsequently heat-treated at 800 or
1000°C employing a flow of 330 cm?®/min (STP)
of dry helium showed that very small quantities

94

of 13°Ba deposited on the deposition tubes. Even
smaller quantities of transported '*°Ba were found
on the deposition tubes from runs in which heat-
treated impregnated graphite specimens were
oxidized by steam-helium mixtures [900 cm? /min
(STP) of helium] at 1000°C. The data suggest that
barium is less readily transported by wet helium
The fact that all the impreg-
nated graphite specimens had received a heat

cates the comparison, however, because there is
evidence that barium is fixed in graphite to some
extent by the prior heat treatment. The flow rate
of the dry helium during the heat treatment at
1000°C appears to have had an important effect

on the movement of barium. The one run made at
975°C using a flow rate of 930 cm®/min (STP)
of dry helium showed a much larger transport of
1338a than those runs made at the lower flow rate
of 330 em¥/min (STP). Counting data obtained
from the sectioned deposition tube used in the
run at the higher flow rate of dry helium are given
in Fig. 9.1. The marked temperature dependence
of the 1??Ba deposition suggests that condensation
of some species occurred over a relatively short
length of the deposition tube. At this stage, how-
ever, the transported species has not been identi-
fied, and the available data do not permit an
accurate determination of the condensation tem-
perature or heat of sublimation. A gamma scan
of the tube did not provide a better profile than
that obtained by sectioning. A smaller temperature
gradient and improved sectioning or scanning
techniques are required to provide the more precise
data needed for further study of the transported
material.

Sectioning and counting of the deposition tube
used in the run in which irradiated graphite from

95

loop 1, experiment 14 was oxidized by steam
(Table 9.1) revealed that appreciable activity had
been transported downstream by the wet helium.
The deposition profile is given in Fig. 9.2, in
which the total gamma activity is shown as a
function of distance (temperature) along the dep-
osition tube. The two maxima indicate that at
least two radioactive species had been transported
by the wet helium. Further examination of the
sections by means of a gamma spectrometer gave
the data included in Fig. 9.3. It was possible to
separate the activities due to !!'%Ag, 1%%Cs, and
137¢s.  Silver-110 was produced from structural
materials which were used in the irradiation ex-
periment and which subsequently migrated to the
graphite. Low levels of activity from other nu-
clides are probably masked by silver and cesium.
Experimental difficulties similar to those indicated
for 133Ba transport preclude any rigorous analyses
of data obtained for *!%aAg, 134cg, and Cs
transport at this time.

OXIDATION OF COATED FUEL PARTICLES
BY WATER YAPCR

J. E. Baker

The pyrolytic-carbon coating on the fuel particle
is expected to retain gaseous fission products
until the coating fails; nonvolatile fission products
may diffuse slowly into the coating during pro-

longed use at high temperatures. If leakage of
water vapor into the reactor occurs, subsequent
oxidation of the coating on the fuel particle may
cause failure of the coating and release of gaseous
fission products. The nonvolatile fission products
may be transported by the coolant and deposited
on various surfaces within the reactor following
failure of the coating.
97

Earlier studies® * of the oxidation of pyrolytic-
carbon-coated fuel particles by water vapor were
performed at temperatures of 1000°C or less and
utilized partial pressures of water vapor ranging
from 4.5 to 560 tors. The effects of higher tem-
peratures and lower concentrations of water vapor
have been examined in more recent studies.’
Rates of reaction of pyrolytic-carbon coatings
present on unirradiated fuel particles were deter-
mined at temperatures of 1100 to 1400°C. Helium
waler-vapor mixtures containing 500 to 1000 ppm
(parts per million by volume) of water vapor and

having a total pressure of 1 atm were used in a
single-pass system. Reaction rates were obtained
from weight changes given by a continuously re-

determined by microscopic examination and acid
leach of the oxidized coated fuel particles.

Experiments performed in mullite reaction tubes
during the early part of these studies gave results
which were sc erratic that it was impossible to
determine the effect of temperature and water vapor
concentration on the reaction rates. In virtually
all cases, the observed reaction rates decreased
with time, and in some instances the final rates
were an order of magnitude lower than the initial
rates, Consistent data obtained after replacing
the mullite tube with an alumina tube indicate that
mullite was responsible for the erratic results.
Gearey and Littlewood ® also observed a decrease
in reaction rate with time and attributed it to
catalysis of the steam-graphite reaction by silica
from the mullite tube.

Reaction rates obtained for various batches of
coated fuel particles using an alumina reaction
tube are given in Table 9.2. The most interesting
feature of these data is the large variation in

reaction rates found for the different batches.

Isotropic VI and VII particles, for example, were
less reactive than Isotropic V particles. The
lower coating density (1.55 compared to 2.00
g/cm? for Isotropic VI) of Isotropic V particles
may be responsible for the higher reaction rates.
Some of the YZ and OR batches of particles,
however, have properties (including density) very
similar to those of Isotropic VI particles but were
considerably more reactive.
The long exposure times combined with rel-
atively high reaction rates resulted in oxidation
of a large portion of the coatings present on a
number of batches of particles. In view of this,
it is not surprising that severe damage and high
percentages of failures occurred. Microscopic ex-
amination suggests that a pitting attack followed
by cracking of the coatings occurred at all tem-
peratures. Conditions were mote favorable for
Isotropic VI particles because of lower reaction
rates and less burnoff of the coatings. These and
other data indicate that ~10 wt % of the coatings
may be removed before failure occurs with Iso-
tropic VI particles. Subsequent studies, in which
failures will be detected by bursts of activity
from irradiated materials, will utilize higher partial
pressures of water vapor to reduce failure time,

IRRADIATION EFFECTS ON PYROLYTIC-

P. E. Reagan J. G. Morgan J. W. Gooch

We are studying the irradiation effects on coated
fuel particles by measuring the fission-gas release
rates during irradiation at high temperatures, and
by postirradiation examination to determine what
damage was done. These studies are being per~
formed in cooperation with the groups who are
developing the coatings for fuel particles at
ORNL, General Atomic, and the Carbon Products
Division of Union Carbide Corporation. The in-
tegrity of production-run coated particles for the
AVR reactor was studied during a long-term test.
The effectiveness of silicon carbide barrier to
solid fission product release is being studied,
of a gas gap in retarding
release is also being in-

Pyrolytic-carbon-coated

fuel elements for the pebble-bed gas~cooled
German AVR reactor, were irradiated to 10 at. %
heavy-metal burnup at 1300°C.! These were a
blend of several batches of duplex-coated par-
ticles that were representative of the production-
mun coated particles.? The fractional fission-gas
release for 38Kr was 5 x 1079 at the beginning of
the test and increased with burnup to 4 x 1073.
No bursts of fission gas were released during the
test, and no broken coatings were found on post-
irradiation examination.3 Metallographic exami-
nation revealed some damage to the inner coating,
but nothing that indicated potential failure of the
coated particles.

Pyrolytic carbon coatings on fuel particles will
contain essentially all of the fission gases, but
at elevated temperatures some of the solid fission
products (notably Str, Ba, and Cs) will diffuse
through the coating. To reduce the migration of
fission solids, a silicon carbide barrier layer
may be deposited between layers of pyrolytic
carbon. One experiment (capsule A97) contain-
ing thorium-uranium carbide—coated particles of
this type (batch GA-327) was irradiated at 1300°C
for 1800 hr. The fission-gas release was low

but the decay time was too long for conclusive
results. No appreciable fractions (<1073) of the
zirconium and cerium were found outside the fuel.
About 5% of the cesium had escaped from the fuel
and graphite holder and had condensed on the
relatively cold metal surfaces of the capsule.
Strontium appeared to be considerably more mobile;
more than 50% of the ®°Sr had escaped the fuel
and was found in significant fractions (>1%) in
the graphite holder and shell and on the metal
capsule. With the exception of some 2% of the
137Cs found the lead tube,
fractions of any of the fission products were found
outside the irradiation capsule. This is the first
of a series of experiments to study the release of

IN-PILE TESTS OF A MODEL TO PREDICT
THE PERFORMANCE OF COATED
FUEL PARTICLES

P. E. Reagan

A mathematical model that will predict the
conditions under which a pyrolytic-carbon-coated
particle will fail has been formulated by Prados
and Scott.* This model takes into consideration
the combined effects of fuel swelling and fission-
gas pressure from fuel bumup, and fast neutron
damage to the coating. To test the model, we
irradiated a capsule containing about 4000 coated
particles with structural characteristics for which
the model was readily applicable. These were
sol-gel uo, particles, coated with a high-density
inner

laminar pyrolytic carbon

high-density isotropic carbon outer coating.

The
average fuel particle diameter was 202 pu, and the
average coating thickness was 123 uy. These pat-
ticles (designated OR-YZ66) were irradiated at
1400°C in the B9 facility. After 1209 hr (15 at. %
uranium burnup), the particles began to release
bursts of fission gas at irregular intervals. The
bursts continued, and at the end of the test (23%
burnup) we had observed 197 bursts. Postirradia-
tion examination of the coated particles showed
that about 5 to 10% of the coatings had indeed
broken and in many cases were completely sep-
arated from the uranium oxide particles, as shown
in Fig. 10.2. Metallographic examinations are in
progress, and postirradiation burnup determina-
tions are being made to check the values ob-
tained by argon activation during irradiation.

The mathematical model had predicted coating
failure at 14.2 at. % burnup.® Since the first
failure occurred at 15% burnup and a rather small
fraction of the coated particles had failed even
at 23% burnup, it appears that the calculation gave

thickness.® The coated-particle dimensions are
given in Table 10.1. These coated particles were
irradiated in capsule B9-30 at 1400°C for 159 hr
(1.9 at. % uranium burnup). At the beginning of
the test, the fractional release of ®2Kr was in the
10~7 range, but it increased suddenly to the
10~* range near the end of the test when particles
from batch OR-494 (which had the largest ratio of
porous coating to pyrolytic coating) began: to
rupture. None of the 15 lowe and intermediate-
ratio particles (batches OR-491 and -493) failed;
in both cases about half of the thickness of the
porous carbon coating had been consumed during
irradiation; but there was no evidence of uranium
carbide formation. Most of the high-ratio particles
(batch OR-494) either failed or were damaged
almost to the point of failure. Failure was by
unilateral movement of the uo, through both
layers of the coating. The fuel in these particles
appears to have operated at a higher temperature
than particles with the porous carbon
coating. Crystals of UC, were found at the fuel
surface of the totally failed particles.

When the experiment was designed, it was as-
sumed that the five coated particles with the
thinnest porous carbon layer would fail first,
because there is little room for expansion of the
fuel and accumulation of fission gas. The coated
particles with thick layers of porous carbon were
not supposed to fail. The burnup was too low
to cause failure in any of these particles. We
have observed, however, that a very thick buffer
layer of porous carbon will insulate the fuel

thinner

particle and may cause failure because of ex~
cessively high temperature in the fuel.

POSTIRRADIATION TESTING OF COATED
FUEL PARTICLES

To aid in the development of better coatings for
coated fuel particles, a series of postirradiation
anneals have been made on four types of pyrolytic
carbon coatings applied to UC, and UO, fuel
particles. Fuel migration studies by metallography

and microradiography have been made, and fission
products released during anneals are being ana-
lyzed. Anisotropy, density, and crystallite size
were the variables in the four types of outer
coatings, the details of which are given in Figs.
10.3 and 10.4. These coatings were applied over
identical inner coatings. The coated particles
were all irradiated in the same capsule at the
same temperature (1400°C) and to the same burnup
(14.5% of the heavy metal). Samples of ten
coated particles from each batch were annealed at
1700°C, and duplicate samples were annealed at
2000°C for a total of 19% hr for each sample in
steps of 6%, hr.7-8

Evaluation of Fuel Migration by Msta!lography
and Microradiography

Microradiographs and metallographic photomi-
crographs were made on each of the eight batches
of coated particles as coated, on the irradiated
coated particles before heating, aod on the ir-
radiated coated particles after the 1700 and
2000°C anneals. The photomicrographs are shown
in Figs. 10.3 and 10.4. The microradiographs are
not shown, but the outer diameter of the dense
areas in the radiographs corresponds to that of
the shaded or spotted areas of the coatings in the
photomicrographs, indicating uranium diffusion
into these areas.

Reaction areas in the coated Uo, particles
were restricted to the inner coating. Spearhead-
type attack occurred during irradiation in coated
particles with low-temperature outer coatings, and
the UO, seemed to expand to fill the void areas.
In the coated uo, particles with outer coatings
deposited at 2000°C, spearhead attack is not
evident, and penetration of the inner coating is
slight; this is probably a result of the 2000°C
heat treatment received during the deposition of

the outer coatings. The uo, particles lost

carbide formation was evident.

The UC, fuel showed no apparent fine porosity
after irradiation. Heat treatment at 2000°C seemed
to have consolidated the fine porosity into larger
pores or voids. Some graphite flakes were seen
around the periphery of the fuel particles. The
particle-coating reaction areas in the coated
carbide particles were not as local as the spear-
head attack in the coated oxide particles and
were associated with a progressive, more ex-
tensive diffusion of fuel into the coating. The
microradiographs of the unirradiated carbide par-
ticles indicated that fuel diffusion into the inner
coatings started during the manufacture of the
particles. Penetration of the inner coatings was
complete in all coated carbide particles after
irradiation, as indicated by the spotted areas in
the micrographs. Diffusion of fuel deep into the
low-density outer coating in the
irradiated YZ-13 coated particles. Large voids
and separation of the inner coating from the outer
coating were apparent in the YZ-15 and YZ-19

was evident

Coating Stability

No coating failures were observed in the eight
groups during irradiation at 1400°C. Coatings of
the UC, particles failed during the postirradiation
tests at both 1700 and 2000°C, but no failures
occurred with the UO, particles. Based on 8°Kr
release, approximately 30% of the YZ-4 sample
and 25% of the YZ-13 sample failed at 1700°C.
At 2000°C, 80% of the YZ-4, 70% of the YZ-13,
and 45% of the YZ-19 samples failed. Failures all
occurred during heatup or within a few minutes
after the annealing temperature was reached.

The two samples of coated uc, particles which
did not fail at 1700°C (one of which also survived
the 2000°C anneal) had undergone the heat treat-
ment during fabrication. We think that the migra-
tion of fuel into the coatings of UC, particles
weakened the coating and caused the high per-
centage of failures.

IRRADIATION EFFECTS ON COMPATIBILITY
OF FUEL OXIDES AND BERYLLIUM
OXIDE WITH GRAPHITE

D. R. Cuneo
C. A. Brandon?

H. E. Robertson
E. L. Long, jr.'°

The compatibility of (U, Th)0, with graphite and
the compatibility of beryllium oxide with graphite
were studied in separate experiments in the ORR.

(U, Th)O ,-Graphite Experiment

The objectives of this experiment were to study,
at a fuel center temperature of 1650°C and a sur-
face temperature of 1370°C, irradiation effects on
chemical compatibility of (U,Th)O, with graphite
and fission-gas release, and to determine possible
fuel swelling and its effects on the graphite.

The assembly was swept with helium containing
250 ppm of CO to suppress the reaction of the
fuel oxides with graphite. The fuel loading and
operating conditions are given in Table 10.2.

During the last six weeks of irradiation, the
133% release rate increased from 1.5 to 18%;
the temperature drop from fuel center to surface

increased from 315 to 390°C. The gamma scan of
the capsule after irradiation and before disassembly
showed about 12 individual peaks of activity for
the space occupied by eight hollow pellets in the
upper fuel region. This indicated that the pellets
were broken and pieces had separated; this was
verified upon disassembly. The seven solid
pellets in the upper region showed general de-
terioration of their outer surfaces. The 12 pellets
in the lower region appeared intact; however,
attempts to determine dimensions caused one of
them to powder.

Metallography revealed that because of densi-
fication there was much less porosity in ‘the
irradiated sample (compared to an unirradiated
control), and shrinkage cracks were apparent. In
spite of this shrinkage, the diameters of two pel-
lets which we were able to measure did not
change. Weight and dimensional changes of the
graphite disks and spacers were negligible.

We conclude that no carbide formation occurred

BeO-Graphite Experiment

The BeO-graphite test was designed to study
irradiation effects at 1500°C on the chemical
compatibility of graphite with BeO, to investigate
the distribution of °Li formed in the Be, and to
determine weight, dimensional, and structural
changes in the graphite and BeQ. A BeO ring and
a graphite ring were in close contact on flat suf
faces and were nested over a solid BeO core
within a graphite sleeve.

The experiment was not fueled. The desired
temperature was achieved for about four months
by gamma heating. During the last five months
of irradiation, the temperature gradually fell to
ahout 1280°C, probably because of formation of
soot (CO » CO, + C), resulting in loss in effec-
tiveness of reflective insulation in the capsule.
The total irradiation dose was 1.0 x 102%! neu-
trons/cm? (E > 0.18 Mev).

There was no physical damage to the BeO or
graphite during irradiation. Metallographic exami~-
nation of selected surfaces showed no reaction
products, and x-ray diffraction of the BeO ring
showed no Be C. There was a deposit of Mo, C
on the graphite sleeve adjacent to several large
holes which appeared molybdenum heat
shield,

Examination of the irradiated graphite showed

no microstructural changes. Examination of the
irradiated BeOQ showed that the grain size doubled,
and each grain was outlined by gas bubbles, as
seen in Fig. 10.5. Analyses of experimental com-
ponents for Li concentrations showed that the
major portion of the °Li stayed in the BeO core
where it was formed. A surface-to-volume rela.
tionship for ®°Li retention was found by comparing
the Bel) ring with the BeO core. This is in
agreement with work by Stieglitz and Zumwalt.!?

Weight and dimensional changes for the BeO and
graphite showed about 1% shrinkage for the
graphite and 0.5% expansion for the BeO.

FAST GAS-COCLED REACTOR DEVELOPMENT

E. L. Long, Jr.*°
j- A. Conlin”

D. R. Cuneo
tI. E. Robertson

During the past year we have begun postirra-
diation evaluations of experimental assemblies
related to fuel elements for fast gas-cooled re-
actors. This is a cooperative program with
General Atomic Division (GA) of General Dy-
namics Corporation. Details of test conditions
and procedures were determined by the ORNL
Reactor Division in cooperation with GA, and the
fuel specimens were supplied by GA. The present
series of tests is designed to investigate the
effects of irradiation, thermal cycling, external
pressure, and fuel-cladding interactions on the
integrity and behavior of metal-clad UO, fuel
elements having design features that approximate
those for the General Afomic fast gas-cooled ree
actor design. Design and operation of these ex-
perimental assemblies and details of postirradia-
tion findings have been reported elsewhere, !?~15

Two types of elements are being studied in the
first group of tests: the fuel-supported type, in
which the cladding is designed to collapse onto
the fuel pellets at the outset of pressure and
temperature application, and the free-standing fuel
ot ““flexcan’’ type. ‘The latter has a deformed
section of cladding above the fueled region that
is capable of flexing with pressure changes, and
the internal void is filled with sodium.

We have completed examinations of four as-
semblies (lacking metallography for the fourth)
which contained six of the fuel-supported elements
and two of the sodium-filled flexcan types. All
elements were fueled with uo, pellets.

Operating data and metallographic findings are
given in Table 10.3, while the appearance of two
of the test elements is shown in Fig. 10.6.

To summarize the postirradiation findings:

In all cases the cladding showed no indica-
tions of failure, despite the fact that element
GA1 was badly deformed and GAZ was deformed
to a lesser extent. (Some more recent elements
have been prepressurized to avoid large pres-
sure differences across the cladding.)

There was no evidence of incompatibility be-
tween the cladding and the fuel in the ele-
ments tested, except for subsurface voids (to
a depth of about 10% of the wall thickness)
noted in the inner surface regions of GAl
(Hastelloy X).

There was no evidence of fuel melting in any

experiments simulating specific reactor operating
conditions. We are seeking a general solution
to this problem by studying the behavior of
fission-gas release under well-controlled condi-
tions in an attempt to understand the basic mech-

anisms of fission-gas release.!9721

Defect-Trap Model

As a result of these studies, we believe that

the fission gas is released by a combination
trapping and diffusion process, where the trapping
is the dominant factor determining the time for the
gas to escape. We have formed a defect-trap
theory which postulates that defects in the uo,
crystal structure will trap migrating xenon and
krypton atoms.?? Some defects, such as grain
boundaries and closed pores, are naturally present
in the uo, and others can be formed by irradia-
tion. The irradiation-formed defects start as
point defects which may be destroyed by annealing
but may cluster to form larger defects that will
require longer times to anneal. Experiments have

shown that the model has the correct general

characteristics ?® and that grain boundaries will
trap fission gas.?* This model predicts that
higher fission rates, which will produce more

fission gas, will also produce more traps; there-
fore, the fission-gas release rate will not change

much with a change in fission rate.

Fission-gas release measurements have been
made during fission-rate and temperature oscil-
lations. These data are being fitted into a com-
puter code to determine the parameters of the
defect-trap model. One complication was caused
by the mixing of the fission gas with the flowing
helium sweep gas. We developed an apparatus to
measure the amount of mixing, using argon to
simulate the fission gas and a thermal conduc-
tivity cell to measure argon concentration in the

sweep gas. The mixing transfer function has now

fission-gas release transfer function for the in-

Fission fragments which recoil free of the speci-
men surface will knock out UO, molecules along
with any fission gas in the immediate vicinity.
The knockout release depends on the fission rate,
the total surface area of the specimen, and pos-
sibly the condition of the surface. In order to
study the effects of surface condition on fission-
gas release, the gas release rates from UO, single-
crystal specimens with highly polished surfaces

reduction in area.

temperature dependence. The rougher surfaced
polycrystalline specimen shows greater knockout
release (both specimens are the same size). At
temperatures above 700°C the gas release is from
point-defect traps for both specimens. At 950

to form clusters, slow down the gas

crystal specimen. The point defects are trapped
by grain boundaries in the polycrystalline speci-
men before they can cluster, and therefore the
step is absent. At higher temperatures, the
clusters in the single-crystal specimen may an-
neal and migrate, and once again the release rate
has an exponential temperature dependence, but

show that irradiation at a low (100°C) tempera-

definite trends:

These changes of thermal conductivity with tem-
perature, while fissioning, are consistent with
the concept that disorder lowers the thermal con-
ductivity. When the temperature of the specimen
is changed (for example from 600 to 700°C) while
at a constant fission rate, two different processes
are in competition which affect the thermal con-
ductivity: (1) the conductivity of the undamaged
matriz tends to decrease as the temperature is
increased, and (2) the increased temperature would
increase the conductivity by annealing the accu-
mulated radiation damage. When the temperature
is increased from 600 to 700°C, the themmal con-
ductivity increases because annealing the radi-
ation damage is the dominant process. At tem-
peratures higher than about 900°C, the equilibrium
amount of damage is small enough so that the
change in conductivity caused by the increase in
temperature will result in a net lowering of the
conductivity.

The specimen is moved sinusoidally in the reac-
tor neutron flux. The fission rate and, thus, the
heat production within the specimen respond in-
stantaneously to the change in neutron flux, but
the temperature does not. If the oscillations are
so rapid that the temperature does not have a

During the past year we have initiated an in-
of the irradiation behavior of
commercially available translucent aluminum

possible insulator in thermionic emitters. The
objectives were (1) to establish its limits of
stability toward fast neutrons and (2) to determine
whether grain boundary separation would occur at
very high doses, as it does in BeO at doses well
below 1 x 102! neutrons/cm?. The experimental

Gross Damage

At low irradiation doses, translucent ALO, is
much more resistant to fracturing than sintered
ALO. Below 3 x 10%! neutrons/em? (> 1 Mev),
there was virtually no fracturing of translucent
Al O,, but severe fracturing along intergranular
paths occurred at higher doses.

Metallographic Exeminations

Grain boundary separation begins to appear at
a dose of 2.3 x 10%! neutrons/cm? (>1 Mev).
This separation is very extensive al a dose of
4.7 x 1021. (>1 Mev). The same degree of grain
boundary separation occurs in BeO at doses
smaller by a factor of 5 to 10. Grain boundary
separation in translucent AlLO, is probably the

predecessor of gross fracturing.

Grain boundary separation in BeQ compacts
irradiated at low temperatures is generally
believed to result from anisotropic lattice

parameter expansion. In the case of ALO, how-
ever, the lattice parameter expansion in itself
probably does not produce the grain boundary
separation, which is observed in increasing degree
as the neutron dose is increased from 2.3 to 4.7 x
102! neutrons/cm? (>1 Mev). The lattice parameter
expansion in ALO, is small and does not increase
with increasing neutron dose over this range. It is
possible, however, that defect agglomerates too
large to affect the lattice parameters cause an

the gross volume expansions.

approximately the same as that of the corresponding
carbides fabricated by the other methods,

The following conclusions were drawn from the
results of the low-temperature (300 to 700°C)

irradiations.

1. The gross volume expansion is the sum of
the lattice parameter expansion and agglomer-
ates of defects too large to affect measured
values of the lattice parameters.

2. A collapse of the large agglomerates as the
neutron dose is increased from 1 to 5 x 102!
. neutrons/cm? (>1 Mev) is the principal cause
of the shrinkage in gross volume over this
dose range.

3. The leveling effect on gross damage to the
five carbides when explosion-pressed samples
were irradiated indicates that the nickel
additive is primarily responsible for the in-
creased fracturing observed.

4. Hot~pressed and slip-cast—sintered tungsten
carbide and titanium carbide prepared without
additives are more resistant to fast-neutron
irradiation at low temperatures (<700°C) than
any of the other types of carbide specimens

SOLUBILITY OF CALCIUM SULFATE

IN SEA SALT SOLUTIONS TO 200°C;

TEMPERATURE-SOLUBILITY LIMITS
FOR SALINE WATERS!

W. L. Marshall Ruth Slusher

In a previous study? the extensive solubility
measurements of calcium sulfate and its hydrates
in sodium chloride solutions” were used to estimate
solubility limits for these species in saline waters
in general, since such estimates are of great value
to those concerned with distillation of saline
waters. The effect of divalent ions (magnesium
in particular), which can partially complex the
sulfate ion and thereby increase the solubility of
calcium sulfate over that ‘“‘normally’’ expected,
could not be taken into account in these estimates.
We have, therefore, measured the solubility of
calcium sulfate (or of the dihydrate at temperatures
below 100°C) in sea salt solutions (aqueous solu-
tions containing the salt composition of seawater
bul with varying degrees of concentration or dilu-
tion) at temperatures from 30 to 200°C and at ionic
strengths to 6 m, and have compared the results
with those obtained in sodium chloride solutions.
Figure 12.1 shows all solubility values obtained
experimentally; in this figure the logarithm of the
solubility product, K[ , is plotted against a func-
tion of the formal ionic strength, /. The tem Kp
is defined as the molal solubility of calcium sulfate
times the molality of total sulfate. The analogous,

Crevice Attack

Titanium has excellent resistance to saline waters,
but at temperatures of 150°C and higher it is subject
to severe corrosion damage in crevices.® Studies
to determine the cause and to find ways to mitigate
such attack are in progress.

Electrochemical polarization studies at tempera-
tures up to 150°C showed that it was not possible
to produce corrosion of the ‘same magnitude as
observed in crevices when the pH of 1 # NaCl
solutions was 3 or higher; this suggests that the

small volume of solution in the crevice becomes
appreciably acid (more than 107? M) before crevice
corrosion can occur.® To determine the approxi-
mate pH of the solution in a corroding crevice,
specimens were prepared in which the tip of a fine
titanium capillary extended into the crevice. The
capillary tubing passed through the head of an
autoclave, and with appropriate valving a small
volume of the solution from the crevice region
could be sampled while the specimen was at 150°C.
The pH of single small drops of solution was about
1 in those cases where crevice corrosion was
observed and 4 to 5 when significant corrosion
was absent. The pH of the bulk solution was 6
to 7.

Figure 12.3 shows a series of partial anodic
polarization curves obtained potentiostatically in
a solution containing 0.1 # HCI and 0.9 M NaCl
The curves originate at the corrosion potential,
and the potential was changed in a noble direction
at 3-min intervals. In the active region the current
density achieved a steady-state value in less than
3 min, whereas in the passive region the current
density decreased slowly for long periods. Although
not shown, the passive region extends up to the
pitting potential, which is higher the lower the

The preceding results imply that a titanium alloy
resistant to dilute acid solutions at 100°C may be
immune to crevice corrosion at higher temperatures;
conversely, an alloy showing active corrosion in
dilute acid solutions at lower temperatures probably
will be susceptible to crevice attack at high tem-
peratures. It was of interest, therefore, to deter~
mine the anodic polarization characteristics of a
number of commercially available titanium alloys
and of alloys prepared in small quantities by the
Metals and Ceramics Division. The nominal com-
positions of the commercial alloys tested were:
0.15% Pd; 4% Mn—4% Al, 5% Cr—3% Al; 4% V—-6%
Al; 14% V-11% Cr—4% Al, 2.5% Sn-5% Al, 2%

Cu; 1% Sn; 1% Al; 2% Ni; and 1% Ni-1% Mo.
Potentiostatic anodic polarization curves were
obtained for each alloy in a solution containing
0.1 M HCl and 0.9 ¥ NaCl at the atmospheric
boiling temperature. Of all the alloys tested, only
the 0.15% Pd alloy, those containing 5% or more

Mo, and both alloys containing nickel showed

no active region. Open-circuit potentials of freshly
abraded or pickled surfaces for the latter group
of alloys were greater than the active potential
(more than ~0.4 v vs S5.C.E.), whereas all the
other alloys had polarization curves similar to that
observed with commercial purity titanium, The
critical current density for passivation, however,
varied somewhat from alloy to alloy.

Additional anodic polarization curves were ob-
tained in boiling 1 # HCl with those alloys ex-
hibiting passivity in the 0.1.4 HCI1-0.9 #f NaCl
solution. In this environment only the alloys
containing 20 and 30% Mo and the 0.15% Pd alloy
did not develop a potential characteristic of actively
corroding titanium. The 2% Ni alloy was passive
initially, but after exposure to the 1 M HCI for
several days or after cathodic polarization, the
alloy developed an active potential and corroded
at about the same rate as pure titanium. The 1%
Ni-1% Mo alloy exhibited borderline passivity.
Most of the time the potential of the alloy was
about —0.3 v vs S.C.E., but periodically it de-
creased to —0.47, at which potential the alloy
After a few
minutes at the latter value, the potential returned
to ~ 0.30 v vs S.C.E. The time between periods
of active corrosion was 20 to 30 min.

On the basis that crevice corrosion occurs be-
cause of the production and maintenance of an
acid solution in the crevice, the alloys which
would tend to resist such attack are 2% Ni, 5% Mo,
1% Ni + 1% Mo, 10% Mo, 0.15% Pd, 20% Mo, and
30% Mo, with the last being the most resistant.
Observations on a large number of specimens
exposed in high-temperature (150 to 200°C) loop
experiments are qualitatively consistent with this

ranking, but a satisfactory quantitative means of
assessing and demonstrating susceptibility has not
been devised.

Pitting

Titanium, in common with many other metallic
materials of construction, owes its immunity to
corrosion to the existence of a passive oxide
layer at the metal-solution interface. Except in
strongly acidic solutions under reducing condi-
tions, titanium normally corrodes spontaneously
at a very low rate in the passive state, and the
current density of the anodic process (formation of
a TiO, passive layer) is independent of the value
of the electrode potential over a wide potential

123

range. However, in solutions containing a suf-
ficient concentration of chloride ions (also bromide
or iodide ions), localized breakdown of the passive
layer occurs, and titanium exhibits a pitting poten-
tial similar to that observed for aluminum, iron,
stainless steel, and other metals and alloys which
are capable of existing in both active and passive
states,

Electrochemical studies of titanium alloys in
saline waters have shown a sharp inverse dependence
of the pitting potential on temperature. Thus,
whereas most such alloys require anodic potentials
of the order of 10 v or higher to initiate breakdown
of the protective oxide and consequent pitting
attack at approximately 25°C, we have found that
the potential required is only 0.5 10 2.0 v at elevated
temperatures. Details of the variation of the pitting
potential with temperature are dependent on alloy
and solution composition but have been shown to
be quite reproducible under a given set of conditions.

The effect of temperature on the pitting potentials
of a number of titanium alloys is shown in Fig.
12.4. These data were obtained by variation of the
temperature of the 1 # NaCl solution while the
titanium electrodes were polarized to their pitting

potentials by passage of a constant high anodic
current. Commercially pure Ti alloys and the 0.15%
Pd alloy, with small amounts of added elements,
show high pitting potentials (9 to 11 v) in the
vicinity of room temperature. With increasing
temperature the pitting potentials of these materials
decrease more or less uniformly to values of the
order of +1 to 2 v at 175 to 200°C. A relatively
sudden change (—2 v) in the pitting potential of
the 0.15% Pd alloy occurs in the vicinity of 125°C.
The type 150 A alloy (28% Cr, 0.3% Fe) shows a
similar sharp drop in the value of its pitting poten-
tial in the vicinity of 70°C; the pitting potential
changes about 2.5 v over a temperature range of
only a few degrees. Pitting potentials of the type
110-AT alloy (5.5% Al, 2.5% Sn) are generally low
and attain values of only about +0.4 v at 190°C.

Qualitatively, the curves of Fig. 12.4 show that
in general the addition of alloying elements de-
creases the value of the pitting potential of tita-
nium. This is consistent with observations of
Fischer”? on effects of various surface treatments
and of intentionally added impurities on the initia-
tion of titanium pitting corrosion. One way to
rationalize these differences in pitting potentials
of titanium alloys is to suppose that the presence
of alloying elements affects the ionic as well as
the electronic conductivity of the protective oxide
layer. It is known that the presence of certain
impurities or lattice defects considerably enhances
the electronic conductivity of rutile (Tio) crys-

tals. 1°~13 Analogous effects on the kinetics of

124

the anodic process have been observed as a result
of incorporation of alloying elements into the TiO

lattice.'4:15 In addition to direct effects on
anodic reaction mechanisms, the presence of
additional electronic energy levels in a semi-

conductor of the type in question and the resulting
enhanced electronic conductivity imply a simul-
taneous increase in hole concentration in the
valence band (weakened bonds), so that a further
increase in the mobility of ionic charge carriers
can be expected.

An analysis based on a simple resistance analogy
suggests that differences in the mobility of ionic
charge carriers, which affect the kinetics of the
anodic processes occurring in the passive oxide
filin, can account for observed variation in values
of pitting potentials as a function of alloy com-
position.

EFFECTS OF RADIATION ON POLYMERS

W. W. Parkinson W. K. Kirkland

Radiation~induced processes in polybutadiene
are significant because the polymer has a simple
hydrocarbon structure related to natural and many
of the synthetic rubbers and because the olefin
groups of this polymer undergo rapid changes
upon irradiation. Furthermore, types of poly~
butadiene are obtainable having a high fraction of
the olefin groups in any one of the three possible
isomeric forms. These forms are cis, trans, and
side vinyl, as shown:

studied were high cis (92%), high trans (95%),
and two mixed polymers, one 73% trans and the
other 71% side vinyl.

To derive actual concentrations of the olefin
groups {rom the spectral measurements, it proved
necessary to use the unirradiated specimens
themselves as calibration standards. Calibration
curves developed from liquid olefins proved
inapplicable. However, they were adequate to
determine the small content of cis groups in the
two mixed polymers. Since the total unsaturation
was known, this permitted the solution of simulta-
neous equations relating the concentration of
trans and side vinyl groups to the optical
densities at 967 and 910 cm™!. The absormptivities
thus calculated, coupled with the accepted value
for the total unsaturation in high-cis polybutadiene,
enabled us to determine the cis concentration in
the polymer of this type from its spectrum. The
integrated band area at 740 em™*, calculated from
theoretical band shapes,®:? was required for the
calibration and concentration determination of the
cis group because of the dependence of the simple
absorptivity on groups adjacent to the cis species
in the molecule.

From this treatment of the infrared spectra, the
concentrations of olefin groups were obtained for
specimens irradiated under various conditions.
The changes in these groups for high-cis poly-
butadiene are plotted vs dose in Fig. 13.1. The
decrease in cis groups at the lower doses appears
to be independent of their concentration (zero-
order), whereas the decrease in trans and side
vinyl groups in the other types of polybutadiene
followed first-order kinetics. In addition, the high-

crease in concentration of one of the olefin iso-
meric forms. In this polymer there was a conver-

The activation energies were calculated from
radiation yields at room temperature and at 110°C.
They are similar to activation energies in other
radiation-induced reactions and indicate that low-

rate constants, and activation energies

energy processes such as the addition of radicals
and the diffusion of relatively small species are
the rate-controlling steps.

The high yields and high rate constants indicate
efficient transfer of radiation energy from the
points of absorption to reactive sites, either
through charge or excitation transfer. It is also
possible that the high rate constants observed for
the side vinyl groups result from short chain
reactions.

The products resulting from these reactions are
unidentified as yet. Because the cross-link yields
are far too low to account for the loss in olefin
groups, it has been speculated that intramolecular

RADIATION-INDUCED REACTIONS
OF HYDROCARBONS

R. M. Keyser W. K. Kirkland

The irradiation of coal together with a condensed-
phase source of hydrogen atoms and alkyl free
radicals offers the possibility of the synthesis of
useful hydrocarbon chemicals from inexpensive
raw materials in a chemonuclear reactor. Initial
irradiations have been confined to a model system
for experimental convenience: n-hexane (simulating
liquefied petroleum gases) the condensed source
of hydrogen and radicals, with naphthalene simu-
lating coal. It is expected that the overall course
of the reaction, the addition of radiation-generated
hydrogen atoms and alkyl free radicals to aromatic
rings,® will be similar in both the model and coal

Samples irradiated with %°Co gamma radiation
have been analyzed by gas chromatography on a
5-m column containing Apiezon L as the separating
medium. The results of a typical run are shown in
Fig. 13.2, from which it is apparent that irradiation
of naphthalene-hexane solutions yields a quite
complex array of products. Efforts to date have
been directed toward identification of the com-
pounds responsible for the peaks in Fig. 13.2.

The six dimers of hexane, the peaks labeled
4,5-diethylectane through n-dodecane in Fig. 13.2,
have been identified by using chromatographic
retention times to obtain estimates of the boiling
points of the compounds in question and comparing
these with literature values. Apiezon L, a nonpo-
lar liquid, separates saturated hydrocarbons es-
sentially on the basis of their boiling points. It

in this way agreed within 1 to 2° of the literature
values for the hexane dimers.

The identification of one of the radiation products
as n-dodecane was further confirmed by the coin-
cidence of its retention time with that of a standard
sample of n-dodecane. This same technique was
also used to tentatively identify the peak preceding
naphthalene as 1,2-dihydronaphthalene.

Compounds corresponding to peaks 1 to 8 in the
chromatogram of Fig. 13.2 have been individually
trapped in glass capillaries at liquid-nitrogen tem-
perature upon elution from the chromatograph.
These collected fractions were used to obtain
ultraviolet absorption spectra in cyclohexane solu-
tion of compounds 1 through 8. Some typical
results are shown in Fig. 13.3 for the 240- to 330-
my region. Differences in overall intensities are

The uv spectrum of ao-methylnaphthalene, in-
cluded in Fig. 13.3 for comparison, exhibits absorp-
tion bands in these same regions also, and the
comparison strongly suggests that compounds 1,
2, 3,4,6, and 8 are a-substituted alkylnaphthalenes.
Since the chromatographic retention time of «-
methylnaphthalene is less than that of compound
1, the alkyl substituents must be larger than methyl.
The uv spectra of compounds 5 and 7 indicate
that these compounds are f-substituted alkyl-
naphthalenes.

Additional amounts of these compounds are being
trapped from the chromatograph effluent, and it is
planned to use these to obtain mass, infrared, and
nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, which, in
conjunction with the uv data, should enable us to
make a positive identification of the unknowns.

ADDITION REACTIONS
OF FURAN DERIVATIVES

C. D. Ropp W. W. Parkinson

The radiation-induced addition of saturated furan
derivatives to olefinic groups is being studied to
develop high-yield reactions which could utilize
radioisotopes in chemical syathesis. An earlier
survey ® covered chiefly monoolefinic and saturated
furan derivatives and cyclohexene. The results
wete promising in that the array of products was
limited; there were only three or four major products,
consisting of dimers, 1:1 adducts, and a non-
volatile residue probably comprising trimers and
higher adducts. Furthermore, the yield of major
products was enhanced by irradiation at higher
temperatures, while the yield of minor products
was reduced. On the other hand, none of the
mixtures containing saturated furan compounds
gave the high yields characteristic of chain reac-
tions.

The system cyclohexene-tetrahydrofuran has
been investigated in detail, since the radiation-
induced reactions of cyclohexene are better known
then those of the other reagents. Solutions of
cyclohexene in tetrahydrofuran in concentrations
of 1:3 and 1:7 were irradiated at room tempera-

ture, and solutions of 1:3 concentration wete
irradiated at 150 and 300°C. The irradiated mix-
tures wete subjected to chromatographic analysis
on a butanediol succinate polar column and on a
silicone rubber nonpolar column. At room tempera-
ture there were four products in the range of dimers
and 1:1 adducts, plus the nonvolatile residue.
At the higher temperatures one of the products
disappeared.

To identify the radiation products observed by
chromatographic analysis, cempounds which were
probable products were synthesized by conven-
tional chemical methods. The chromatographic
retention times of the synthesized compounds were
then matched with those of the radiation products
on columns of at least two types.

The methods used for preparation of the dimeric
compounds were Wurtz-type condensations of or-
ganic halides with active zinc-copper and con-
densations with CH Mgl. For adducts the syn-
thetic method was the Grignard reaction, condensing
the cyclohexenyl or furanyl magnesium halide with
the proper halide. The halides in all these reac-
tions were prepared by accepted methods. For
example, 2-chlorotetrahydrofuran was obtained by
direct chlorination of tetrahydrofuran at —50°C;
allyl-type bromides, such as 3-bromocyclohexene
and 2-bromo-2,5-dihydrofuran, were obtained by
bromination with a suspension of N-bromosuc-
cinimide in carbon tetrachloride. By these methods

dimers and 1:1 adducts of cyclohexane, cyclo-
hexene,
prepared.

By comparing retention times of these synthetic
products with those of the irradiated mixture, the
compounds listed in Table 13.2 were tentatively
identified as the major radiation products. The
identification remains tentative because of the
presence of the products of side reactions in the
synthesized compounds. The synthesized com-
pounds are now being isolated, by distillation
and extraction, for infrared spectra to eliminate
uncertainties. Chromatographic fractions are also
being collected from the radiation products for

tetrahydrofuran, and dihydrofuran were

similar examination to confirm our identifications.

The tabulated product yields were obtained from
chromatographic peak areas utilizing dodecane as
an internal standard. Evaporation of the irradiated
mixture indicated that the yield of polymeric non-
volatile residue was greater than G = 6, probably
exceeding the combined yields of dimers and 1:1

DEVELOPMENT OF RADIATIOR-RESISTANT
INSULATORS

W. W. Parkinson 8. J. Sturm

A program has been initiated under the sponsor-
ship of the Office of Civil Defense to develop
radiation-resistant insulators for personnel dosim-
eters. Since the dosimeters are small fiber elec-
trometers, the electrical resistance of the construc-
tion materials must be very high, both before and
after irradiation.

A copolymer of styrene and a-methylstyrene with
a moderate impurity content has been found to have
high resistance before irradiation and extremely
low postirradiation conductivity. Objectives of the
program, then, are to correlate the electrical con-
ductivity of plastics with the molecular structure

of the base polymers and also with the chemical
nature of the impurities, since these are known to
affect the conductivity prior to irradiation and
appear to play a part in reducing the postirradiation
conduction.

The correlations should permit the selection of
materials andthe development of fabrication methods
suitable for both the bulk insulators and the capac-
itor dielectric in the dosimeters. We also hope to
identify the mechanism of the impurity effects; it
could be a surface process or a process in the bulk
of the polymer involving supplying and trapping
charge carriers.

Analytical work on styrene-base plastics has
indicated that the content of unpolymerized styrene
varies widely in these materials. The copolymer
of low conductivity showed a monomer content of
~0.1%. The solvent-cast film (the form for capac-
itor dielectric and specimen material for resistance
measurement) showed less than 0.01% monomer.
Since the unsaturated nature of styrene monomer
makes it chemically different from the polymer,
the role of the monomer in electrical processes
in the plastic will be investigated early in the
program.

A vibrating-reed electrometer has been modified
slightly to permit electrical measurements in the
Tests have indicated
that its minimum sensitivity is of the order of

tion measurements and at least some of the pre-

required low-current range.

The procurement of sample materials has been
confined to simple polymers, either hydrocarbons
or polymers of carbon, hydrogen, and either oxygen
or nitrogen, and to materials of relatively high

Common commercial additives, for ex-
ultraviolet stabilizers and antioxidants,
have also been obtained.

Measurements and irradiations will be made first

INTERPRETATION OF DCX-2 MASS SPECTRA

Twenty DCX-2 mass spectra obtained during a
single day were subjected to detailed examination.
Four types of impurity gases (viz., not hydrogen)
were distinguished by peak height comparisons.
These four types were:

1. those species generated or evolved near the
spectrometer,

2. the so-called base pressure gases,

3. impurity gases introduced with intentionally
admitted gas,

4, impurity gases generated during beam injection.

As noted earlier,! the spectrometer species de-
cayed rapidly for 30 to 50 min after the spectrom-
eter filament was turned on. Those species,
primarily organic, apparently have no significant
relation to gases impinging on the DCX-2 plasma.
Quantitative interpretation of the mass spectra is
complicated by their presence.

Of far more significance is the behavior of the
Air
leaks have been only occasionally responsible for
a significant part of the background gases. Water
vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane were the prin-
cipal identifiable species in the background gas
on the day of the study (August 11, 1966). Water
vapor constituted about three-quarters of the im-
purity background gases. Although the water par-
tial pressure increased during admission of hydro-
gen, it was possible to notice the variation of
this component of the background during the day.

This variation is shown in Fig. 14.1. This domi-

base-pressure species other than hydrogen.

nant change, except during a period of probe
adjustment at noon, indicates that the water off-
gassing rate increased during the morming and
presumably was a thermal effect. Because of
the dominance of water vapor and its slow removal
from unbaked vacuum systems, some of the param-
eters affecting water behavior (in unbaked stain-
less steel systems) have been separately studied. ?
The partial pressure of carbon dioxide has been
generally observed to follow that of water vapor.
The average catbon dioxide partial pressure ap-
peared to be about 15% of the water vapor pressure
during the day. Methane (present during the tita-
nium evaporation) was about 5% of the water par-
tial pressure. Other organic species and carbon
monoxide comprised the balance of the base-pres-
sure gases, but were not studied.

Of the gases which are introduced along with
intentionally admitted gas, water vapor and air
have been observed. Air from leaks in the gas
manifold is present in amounts which depend upon
the length of time subsequent to manifold evacu-
ation, as well as the leak rate, Water vapor is
usually the dominant manifold impurity and was
so for this study. The water partial pressure
variation with jon-gage reading for a hydrogen leak
is shown in Fig. 14.2. The linearity of the data
points and the times involved in the exposure in-
dicated that this increase was not an artifact of
the spectrometer but was a net increase of water
partial pressure admitted with or due to admission
of the hydrogen. The water pressure was observed
to vary only slightly during beam injection. It
was therefore concluded not to be a gas of the
fourth type (gases produced during beam injection).

parison. The variation of mass 28 (primarily from
ethane, ethylene, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide,
and nitrogen) after adjusting for CO, and ethane
appeared, from consideration of fragmentation pat-
tems, to be primarily carbon monoxide and ethylene
in about equal amounts. The variation of mass
28 so adjusted contributed slightly less to the
total pressure than did methane. A fractional
abundance of 0.003 to 0.004 for each of these
gases relative to hydrogen was indicated. This
behavior appeared to be typical for the mode of
DCX-2 operation at the time this work was done.

The principal organic species identified as being
produced during beam injection are methane, ethyl-
ene, acetylene, and ethane. The partial pressure
of these gases was found for one day to be about
2.5% of the indicated pressure.

For many plasma experiments in DCX-2, it has
not been as necessary to maintain a high-purity
environment as to have some knowledge of the
purity level. A purity index can be defined as

obtained over a period of several hours in the

creasing as discussed above. The points at
indicated pressures of 1.0 and 1.3 x 107° torr,
which were obtained later, were, accordingly, some-
what lower than the values interpolated from the

culated values of P.I, with those shown in Fig.

present in significant amounts,

Residual gas analysis strongly depends on the
useful mass range of the spectrometer, the exist-
ence of identifiable parent mass peaks, and a
knowledge of fragmentation pattems. We have
little knowledge of species with molecular weights
higher than 44 u for the DCX-2 spectrometer, or
higher than about 92 u for the instrument used in
the calibration and chemistry studies. A spectrom-
eter design study has begun with the goal of im-
proving the analytical capability in the ORNL
mirror machines.

MASS SPECTROMETER CALIBRATION STUDIES

Dispersion of mass spectrometer ion beams af-
fects both the cracking pattems and the relative
partial pressure sensitivities for different gases.
Calibration studies carried out using the type of
mass spectrometer used on DCX-2 (Veeco model
No. RGA-3) showed that the instrument has a sig-
nificant degree of mass dispersion. This dis-
persion is attributable to space-charge effects and
to thermal velocities in the direction parallel to
the magnetic field during the ion’s life.
Space-charge effects at higher pressures were
observed as a diminution of ion intensities upon
increasing the hydrogen pressure. As expected,
this effect is most pronounced for gases of higher
molecular weight (e.g., argon and krypton). Hydro-
gen pressures of as much as 2 to 3 x 1075 torr
were needed before a significant decrease of the
28 and 18 mass peaks occurred.

At lower pressures the mass discrimination can
be attributed principally to thermal drift in the
direction of the magnetic field during the flight
time of ions to the collector. Estimation of this
effect for the analyzer
parameters the flight path (23 cm), the ion velocity
derived from the ion energy meter, the average
thermal velocity (at 100°C), and relative spectrom-
eter slit lengths, leads to the estimated transmis-

sions listed in Table 14.1 along with the trans-

region only, using as

mission as determined from experimental data
described below. The observed transmission frac-
tions were uniformly lower than those estimated.
This is presumably due to mass discrimination in
the source. For this 60° spectrometer (supplied
with almost equal source and collector slit lengths),
it should be possible to decrease the mass dis-

crimination of the analyzer region by perhaps 60%,

but probably with little overall improvement of this
parameter because of the source contribution.

The method used to experimentally determine the
extent of mass discrimination was simply to meas-
ure the peak height ratios for argon (+1, +2, and
+3) and compare these with the literature values. 3
(The electron energy for the RGA-3 is 145 + 4 v.)
The same technique applied to the spectrometer
on DCX-2 yielded similar results. The data shown
in Table 14.1 were estimated using a smooth curve
drawn through the points at M/e = 13.3, 20, and
40,
an ion gage for nitrogen and water vapor yielded
additional points within 15 and 5%, respectively,
of the derived argon transmission curve. The ion-
gage sensitivity factor for water vapor was inci-
dentally determined from measured flow

water vapor was found to be 0.9 + 0.03 that of
nitrogen.

These data were used in the measurement of con-
taminant levels in the DCX-2 work described above.
These results should not be indiscriminately ap-
plied to other similar analyzers, because the extent
of mass discrimination is strongly affected by
operating parameters such as repeller potential.
In order to avoid overly harsh evaluation two things
should be noted. The first is that residual gas
analyzers are designed primarily for qualitative
assessment of vacuum conditions and that their
application to quantitative work is usually re-
stricted to individual mass peaks or simple ratios.
The second is that the analytical capability is
restricted generally to masses less than 44 u.

WATER VAFOR CHEMISORPTION
ON STAINLESS STEEL

low partial pressures. The results of the study

 

Low masses are obtained by shunting the magnet,

showed distinctly that chemisorption occurred in
the experimental vacuum system. The experiments
were conducted in a manner to give assurance
that the observed chemisorption occurred primarily
Thus, since a large
body of information on chemisorption exists, the
description of water vapor behavior in vacuum
systems can be greatly simplified. Specifically,
a selection from empirical relations between the
extent of sorption and time, exposure, pressure,
or temperature which are observed for other chemi-
sorption reactions may be applied to studies of
water vapor.

Chemisorption may be distinguished from physi-
cal adsorption using several criteria, including the
following:

on stainless steel surfaces.

1. Chemisorption requires an appreciable (>0.1
ev) heat of activation.

2. It usually involves sorption heat values greater
than about 0.5 to 1.0 ev, whereas physical
adsorption is usually associated with smaller
values.

3. Chemisorption or chemidesorption is (as a con-
sequence of criterion 1) a slow process.

4. The quantity of substance chemisorbed often is
related to time by the empirical relation:

— = ge” 1

a and a are constant during any single experiment

literature on water sorption kinetics at low pres-
sures (<107* torr) or on metals.

The technique used in this study was to observe
the pressure fall after water vapor exposures at
different pressures and durations in a dynamically
pumped vacuum system (Fig. 14.5). The apparatus
was designed to have two regions (4 and B) which
could be separately heated, To minimize tempera-
ture nonuniformity, region 4, a steel tube with
1.1 x 10* cm? area, was baked by resistance
heaters strapped to the outside of an aluminum
pipe which fitted concentrically around the steel
tube with a uniform %,-in. gap. Insulation material
and aluminum foil were applied around the alumi-
num pipe. A copper tubing cooling circuit was
strapped to the steel tube in order to achieve a
rapid cooling capability. Region 8, down to below
the conductance-limiting baffle, was heated using
strapped-on and serpentine heaters, and a hot air
assembly to heat the trap. The mass spectrometer
(Veeco RGA-3) was heated with tape heaters.
Glass jon gages (used only for early experiments)
were heated by heat lamps. Only metal seals
were used.

The water was admitted through a valve from a
regulated pressure of 1 or 2 torrs, The gas line
was periodically baked and operated with cold
water cooling to minimize organic contamination.

For the hot-system, short-exposure cases, the
slope of log Pr ,0 VS t (the usual exhaust relation)
initially corresponded to a value of 540 liters/sec +
10% except when the initial pressure exceeded
1 x 1075 significantly, for which cases the mass
18 spectrometer peak was not exactly proportional
to pressure.

Four typical log Pu,0 VS log t plots are shown
in Fig. 14.6 for the cases of hot and cold region A
and for 0.5-sec and 10-min exposures. The expo-
sure pressures, p_ , were all within 20% except
for case II, where Pep Was about a factor of 5
lower. Exponential exhaust, indicated for water
by curve V, was observed for N, over almost four
orders of magnitude of pressure.

We observed that the log pu,o vs log t plot of
our data closely approximated straight lines of
reproducible slopes, which, of course, varied with
exposure conditions.!! Integration of each curve
from the extrapolated limit of 0.1 sec to 1000 sec
and multiplying the result by our measured H,0
pumping speed (590 liters/sec + 3%) yielded the
quantity desorbed isothermally following the expo-
sure. The value of ¢ (quantity absorbed) is he-
lieved to be within 20% of the measured quantity
desorbed.

The Elovich plots [Eq. (1)] from our data for two
temperatures and normalized to the same exposure
pressure (assuming variation of ¢ with the first
power of p___) are shown in Fig. 14.7. The ex-

The only study found in the literature of the pres-

reported an exponent of 1.2 with thoria at, of
course, higher water vapor pressures. The value
of 1.2 introduces an error band of somewhat less
than 15% to our data. The quantities observed
correspond to about 0.1 monolayer at rcom tem-
perature following a 10-min exposure and about
0.15 monolayer after 30 min. Dust or other im-
purities could be responsible for some or even all
of the observed sorption. We believe, however,
that the method is reliable and that sufficient care

was exercised to be able to attribute the observed
chemisorption to the steel surface,

Some effect on water chemisorption kinetics by
ion or electron bombardment is to be anticipated
by analogy to other chemisorption phenomena.
Neither the magnitude nor the direction of change
seems to be presently predictable. Water sorption
by unbaked and baked stainless steel during a
pressure excursion to atmosphere of different hu-
midities has been observed and is reported in the
literature but with inadequate reported data to
permit scaling the parameters studied here over
the required five to six orders of magnitude.
Samples with different specific surface areas may
be expected to show different sorption capabilities.

The conclusion that chemisorption phenomena
exist leads to possible practical application in

since chemisorption occurs at even very low pres-
sures and is a strong function of exposure time,
maintenance of very low partial pressures of water
by liquid-nitrogen cooling of appreciable areas in
the system, followed by intermittent warming of
the cooled areas, desorption, and rapid exhaust,
should result in a lower water impurity level than
the same period of pumping would produce. Another
consequence of the observations reported here is
that even small water impurity levels introduced
from gas manifolds are expected to result in sig-

W. E. Browning, Jr.

The Nuclear Safety Technical Staff, comprised
of three persons, was formed early this year to
aid in planning, coordinating, and directing the
research and development activities within the
Nuclear Safety Program.

One of the first activities of the technical staff
was to survey work being done in the Nuclear
Safety Program on the development of analytical
models for fission product behavior in various
stages of reactor accidents and to recommend the
initiation of additional theoretical and experi-
mental activities which were needed, preferably in
existing groups outside the technical staff.

In a new activity, theoretical treatment of the
chemical behavior of gas-bome fission products
at high temperatures is combined with a labora-
tory investigation. There are separate studies
of dynamic transport phenomena (continuing) and
of surface phenomena (new) of fission product
deposition at high temperatures. Models are
being developed for the transport and deposition
of fission products in containment vessels and for
the convective circulation of gases. Other theo-
retical work covers the behavior of aerosols. A
new program on behavior of fission products in
gas-liquid systems was started with studies on
the fission product removal by sprays at ORNL
and by suppression pools at General Electric,
San Jose, under subcontract. Another subcontract,
with Battelle Memorial Institute, supports work
on the theoretical chemical yield of methyl iodide.

A continuing program has been maintained for
computing thermochemical equilibria of fission
product fuel mixtures at high temperatures and
for predicting vapor pressures in the gas phase
above a condensed-phase solution. A multi-
component equilibrium program has been obtained
and debugged, and thermochemical data tapes
have been made for U, Sr, 5:0, UO, uo, and

mental program to check theoretical calculations

An experi-

by mass spectrometric measurements has been
initiated, and preliminary shakedown runs have
been made.

One member has assisted in the development of
a theoretical model describing fission product
behavior in containment vessels and in planning
an experimental program of scaling, flow visual-
ization, and pilot-plant experiments to test the
model, At the invitation of the AEC, the staff
has participated in the management of an AEC
contract with Professor N. C. Ozisik at North
Carolina State University, who is working on the
theory of diffusional transport as it applies to
containment vessels,

One member has been assigned full-time to the
program on spray effectiveness (Sect. 18) during
its formative stages. A study undertaken by the
Chemical Technology Division at the instigation
of the technical staff has led to a report on the
theory of foam decontamination as it might be
applied to a reactor containment vessel. !

Recently, one man has spent half time on the
special core melt-thtough problem assisting the
task force directed by W. K. Ergen. The work
involved estimating amounts of fission products

16. Correlations of Fission Product Behavior

THE LIGHT BULB MODEL FOR RELEASE
OF FISSION PRODUCTS

C. E. Miller, Jr.

Experiments in various laboratories and in rte-
actors have accumulated much data on release of
fission products under conditions which simulate
reactor accidents. The effects of important vari-
ables on fission product behavior have generally
been recognized, but interpretations of the data
have been at best empirical. The “light bulb”
model of fission product release presented below
seems to explain in a simple fashion most, if not
all, of the available release data,

Fonda, in studies of the incandescent lamp,
observed that tungsten filaments lost weight (at
a given temperature} more tapidly in a vacuum
than in the presence of a nonreactive gas. He
related this to Langmuir’s? theory that heat loss
from incandescent wires in gases is controlled by
conduction of heat through a stationary gas film
around the wire, Fonda proposed that evaporation
of material from the filament in a ncareactive gas
is controlled by diffusion through a similar station-
ary gas layer. If it is assumed that a heated speci-
men of reactor fuel has such a nonreactive gaseous
boundary layer and that diffusion (by Fick’s law)
through this layer controls the rate of release of
fission products, then the theories of Langmuir
and of Fonda may be applied in a straightforward
manner.

If the rate of evaporation of species 4 is con-
trolled by Fick’s law diffusion of A through a
boundary layer of species B,

EFFECT OF CONTAINMENT SYSTEM SIZE
ON FISSION PRODUCT BEHAVIOR

Simple mathematical models to aid in the de-
termination of effect of containment size on rate
and extent of deposition of iodine from the gaseous
phase have been postulated.
of systems (those with and without condensing
steam) have been considered.

In the absence of steam the principal assump-
tions made were: (1) homogeneous mixing within
the gas, (2) boundary gas layer enveloping. all
surfaces, (3) diffusion through this boundary layer
as the rate-limiting process, and (4) iodine present
in the molecular form with combined forms such as
methyl iodide absent. Mathematical relations in
terms of mass transfer coefficients, surface-to-
volume ratios of containers, and surface-character-
ization parameters were developed for cases with
and without desorption from partially covered sur-
faces.

In the presence of condensing steam, there is
bulk flow of steam toward the walls. In such
cases, it has been assumed that the iodine flux,

Two general classes

which consists of diffusive and bulk flow com-
ponents, may be approximated by the bulk flow
component alone. Furthermore, it has been as-
sumed that the solubility of iodine in steam con-
densate is high enough to permit the iodine and
the steam to condense together with the same
composition as the gas phase. As a result of
these assumptions, mathematical relations have
been derived for the concentration of iodine as a
function of time in terms of the surface-to-volume
ratios, condensing steam fluxes, and steam con-
centrations.

The case of molecular iodine—methyl iodide~
condensing steam has been considered. It was
assumed that the deposition of methyl iodide is
limited by its smaller solubility in steam con-
densate.

Development of the model for predicting mass
transfer coefficients using film theory and boundary
layer analysis for cases in which no steam was
present was based on rough approximations con~
cerning the flow velocity structure within the
containment shell; flows were assumed to be in-

predicted if the temperature differences causing
the flow are very small (0.001°K). Both the
velocities and the temperature differences are too
small to be observed using currently available
instrumentation. The model also predicts size- and
pressure-scaling effects which appear to be sub-
stantiated by limited available data.

Some correlations of the mathematical expres-
sions with experimental data have been performed.
Results of iodine-air experiments in the CMF,
CRI, and NSPP have been compared with the simple
theoretical expressions with moderate success.
The results of the correlations of experiments
with dry atmospheres are shown elsewhere.’ The
values of the mass transfer coefficient and of the
asymptotic concentration were obtained empirically
for the Nuclear Safety Pilot Plant (NSPP) from
results of experiments with iodine in dry air.

Corresponding values for the Containment Mockup
Facility (CMF) and for the Containment Research
Installation (CRI) were obtained by scaling with
size and pressure the NSPP parameters in a man-
ner prescribed by relationships obtained from the
model, For the asymptotic concentrations, the
surface-chemistry effects were assumed equal in
all three systems.

An example of the correlation of data obtained
in the absence of steam in the NSPP and in the
CMF is shown in Fig. 16.1. We can conclude from
the results’ that the model predicts the general
behavior of the concentration-time curve in the
absence of steam. It appears quite successful
in the extrapolation of mass transfer coefficients
as indicated by the agreement between the pre
dicted and experimental initial slopes. The neces-
sity for additional research on the surface chem-
istry of containment materials is apparent from
the relatively poor agreement of the asymptotic
concentrations using the simple assumption of
equal surface behavior in all three facilities.

The simple assumptions of the condensing steam
model have been tested using the experimental
data on an NSPP experiment which provides infor-
mation on both iodine and water condensate col-
lection as well as system pressure and tempera-
ture as a function of time. Figure 16.2 shows a
comparison of the calculated and experimental
values of the iodine collected. The agreement
appears to be quite satisfactory.

Based on a very limited number of tests, it
appears that the behavior of iodine in containment
systems differing in size by two orders of magni-
tude may be correlated with moderate success
utilizing simple mathematical relationships.

CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM STUDIES OF

The presence of CH,I in nuclear reactor environ-
ments poses a potential hazard because of the dif-
ficulties involved in removing this compound from
gases using conventional trapping techniques.
To gain insight into the chemical processes lead-
ing to CH,I formation, a study was performed of
calculated equilibrium concentrations of CH,I
and other important species for a range of condi-
tions typical of reactor-accident systems. A
report of this work has been issued.”

The results of this study indicated that chemi-

be expected to generate CH, L Such materials are

THE ADEQUACY OF SCALEUP IN
EXPERIMENTS OM FISSION PRODUCT
BEHAVIOR IN REACTOR ACCIDENTS

C. E. Miller, Jr. W. E. Browning, Jr.

We concluded in a previous report? that scaling
of egperiments on fission product release and
transport in the U.S, Nuclear Safety Program does
not seem adequate; a very large extrapolation
will be necessary to compare presently available
data to that obtained from the projected Loss-of-
Fluid Test (LOFT).'! In a subsequent report'?
we propose experiments at 1 and 10% of the size
of LOFT (based on the mass of fuel) in order to
fill the gap in scaling.

Intermediate-scale experiments to study fission
product release and transport should be designed
so that they (1) generate fission products with
maximum practical realism as a function of various
simulated loss-of-coolant accident environments
and heatup rates and (2) simulate core geometry
sufficiently to achieve proper temperature profiles
and heatup rates, to allow natural movement of
core components during the heatup cycle, and to
provide a realistic escape path for fission products
through remaining core materials.

The characteristics
capabilities should be incorporated into the experi-

following general and

ments:

1. The experiments should be performed in-pile
on multipin fuel subassemblies to give maximum
realism to the time-temperature-position pro-
files.

2. Where possible the experiments should be de-
signed to accommodate water, liquid metal,
and gas-cooled fuel systems.

3. The released fission products should be trans-
ported through a representative primary system
in which the transport rates result from realis-
tic thermal gradients and natural steam flow.

The proposed experiments on the release and

scribed in some detail elsewhere.!? They are

The fuel in these experiments is to be
melted by nuclear self-heating in a reactor facility
using a driver core. The suggested facilities are
the Power Burst Facility'® for the 1% scale ex-
periment using approximately one LOFT fuel ele-
ment, and the LOFT itself for the 10% scale ex-
using approximately five LOFT fuel

core,

periment
elements,

Alternative experiments at the same scale using
a nonnuclear method of heating are proposed to
fill the gap in scaling if for reasons of expense or
scheduling the nuclear experiments cannot be
performed. The 1% scale experiment is proposed
for the Containment Research Installation,!* and
the 10% scale experiment is proposed for the
Containment Systems Experiment.!® An electrical
method of heating the fuel is proposed, which is
presently under development in an AEC-sponsored
program. 2

The capability of performing any of the proposed
experiments appears to be near at hand. All four
facilities are under construction, and the capability

151

of electrical heating is being developed. How-
ever, three of the four possible experiments involve
facilities which are already scheduled for experi-
mental programs. These are the LOFT, CSE, and
CRI facilities. The addition of these proposed
experiments would cause delays in programs which
are very much needed in other phases of nuclear
safety work. The remaining facility, the Power
Burst Facility, which is still io be constructed,
seems the most promising,

With the addition of these experiments to the
AEC Nuclear Safety Program, the comparison of
size of planned nuclear safety experiments will
be as shown in Fig, 16.4. The accomplishment
of these experiments will produce a scaling range
which should cover all possible mechanisms of
fission product behavior and make extrapolation
of data from one experiment to the other more
reliable,

FISSION PRODUCTS FROM FUELS UNDER
REACTOR- TRANSIENT CONDITIONS

G. W. Parker R. A. Lorenz
J. G. Wilhelm !

ORNL fission product release experiments are per-
formed in the TREAT reactor to study the release
and transport of fission products from fuel during re-
actor transients in which fuel is heated and melts
rapidly. In the current series of experiments, vari-
ous components of the equipment are designed to
simulate the core, pressure vessel, containment ves-
sel, and the filter and charcoal cleanup system of a
typical large pressurized- or boiling-water power
reactor. Experiments 9, 10Z, 11Z, and 12Z were
recently completed and reported in detail else-
where, 2 making a total of six experiments in which
stainless-steel- or Zircaloy-2-clad UO, fuel spec-
imens were melted underwater by transient heating.
The letter Z indicates experiments in which
Zircaloy-2 cladding was used. Each of these ex-

loaded papers into a gas collection tank. In sim-
ulation of accident after-heat, the fuel autoclave
was then heated electrically to about 300°C for
1 hr to boil out any remaining water.

We wished to determine the maximum fission
product release; so in addition to using the two
different cladding materials, the rate of steam
release from the melting region was varied. In
experiments 7 and 87,3 only about 5% of the water
surrounding the fuel specimen boiled out of the
fuel autoclaves in the first minute following the
transient. In experiments 9 and 10Z, approximately
75% of the water boiled out in the first minute,
and essentially all of the water boiled out of the
11Z and 12% fuel autoclaves in 1 min. These two
latest experiments also explored the effect of
pressure during melting by enclosing the fuel and
water in sealed primary vessels. Experiment 11Z
used a 300-psi rupture disk to release the steam,
and experiment 12Z used a 2500-psi rupture disk
along with 500 psi of helium as preliminary pres-
surization. Examination of these two experiments
is in progress.

The fuel and cladding melted completely in
experiments 7, 8Z, 9, and 10Z, except for portions
of the metal end caps. The melted residue from
experiments 7 and 9, which used stainless steel
cladding, appeared to be foamy and more porous
than the residue from experiments 8Z and 10Z.
In Fig. 17.1 the front half of the crucible in ex-
periment 10Z has been removed to reveal some

experiments 7 and 9. Forty-one and forty-nine
percent of the Zircaloy-2 cladding reacted in ex-
periments 87 and 10Z. These results all agree
well with those found by workers at Argonne
National Laboratory in metal-water reaction studies
in TREAT.*

Fission product release and transport was sim-
ilar in all four experiments except that transport
of the volatile elements tellurium, cesium, and
iodine out of the fuel autoclave in experiments
9 and 10Z (6 to 19%) was about twice that in
experiments 7 and 8Z (2 to 7%). The larger release

in 9 and 10Z is attributed to the faster steam
release. About 1% of the barium and strontium,
0.3% of the ruthenium, and less than 0.1% of the
cerium, zirconium, and Uo, were carried out of
the fuel autoclave with the released steam in each
of the four experiments. The condensation process
was highly efficient in trapping fission products
and Uo, in these experiments; a decontamination
factor of about 10% for nonvolatile materials was
observed. No significant effect of cladding ma-
terial was evident.

In experiments 9 and 10Z, distilled-water rinses
of the fuel autoclave walls contained 33 to 44%
of the total cesium and iodine; this behavior sug-
gested rapid formation of nonvolatile water-soluble
compounds, possibly cesium hydroxide and various
metal iodides.

The amount of unreactive or penetrating iodine
was only a small fraction of the total in all four
experiments. Sixty to eighty percent of the total
131] was released from the melted fuel specimens,
but only 0.0006 to 0.005% was found on the char-
coal-loaded papers and in the gas collection tank.
This iodine was characterized as unreactive or
penetrating, based on its poor sorbability in the
bed of 27 charcoal-loaded papers.

The simulated loss-of-coolant experiments, con-
ducted in previously described facilities’ at the
ORR, are designed to provide information on re-
lease and transport of fission products in reactor
accidents. It is intended that the information ob-
tained can be used to predict fission product be-
havior under conditions beyond those tested so
that hypothetical accidents can be more realis-
tically evaluated.

The interpretation of data from previous experi-
ments on fission product release and behavior has

constuction work has been under way on the re-
actor facility.

A major construction program has been carried
on during the past year involving the reactor fa-
cility in which the in-pile fission product release
experiments are performed. The modifications are
in line with the emphasis on fission product trans-
port. They include the construction and instal-
lation of a simulated reactor containment vessel,
the installation of on-line analyzers for the de-
termination of water, hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon
oxides in the sweep gas, and of increased capa-
bility for temperature measurement and control in
the experiment system. A schematic diagram of
the new system is shown in Fig. 17.2. The avail-
ability of this modified facility will allow the
complete study of realistic fission product release,
transport, and behavior in a vessel.

The considerable literature has been examined
in a study of the extent and the rate of sorption
of iodine on a variety of surfaces and possible

components of reactor systems. The practical re-

sults of this study, from nuclear safety consider-
ations, are as follows:

1. Sorption of iodine on several materials (no-
tably clean steel, clean stainless steel, and soiled
steel with oxide coatings) can be interpreted very
well by mechanisms involving monolayer adsorp-
tion with dissociation.

2. Absorption of iodine in water or in agueous
solutions can be treated by use of models involv-
ing diffusion through boundary layers. Such mech-
anisms for iodine deposition will be important
when surfaces are covered with water films during
steam condensation within a containment vessel.

3. Sorption of iodine on stainless steel and
some other metals covered with an oxide layer
(e.g., as-received stainless steel) seems to in-
volve complicated mechanisms and to follow rel-
atively complex kinetics. Since stainless steel
is likely to be an abundant material in containment
systems, it will be necessary to study the sorp-
tion-desorption process as a function of oxide
thickness and temperature.

IGNITION OF CHARCOAL ADSORBERS

C. E. Miller, Jr. R. P. Shields

Charcoal adsorbers are used in many present and
proposed reactor safety systems to remove iodine
from the containment system atmosphere. The High
Flux Isotope Reactor uses such a safety system.
Such charcoal adsorbers will ignite and burn if
temperatures and air flows are sufficiently high.
Reactor accidents would discharge large quan-
tities of fission products whose radioactive decay
could produce serious overheating (especially in
local hot spots) of the adsorber beds. Such ac-
cidents might also permit air to enter the contain-
ment system and the adsorber bed. Accordingly,
we have initiated a program of tests both in the
laboratory and in-pile to establish the effect of
fission products and of irradiation on the ignition
temperature of charcoal adsorbers.

Laboratory studies have been conducted primar-
ily with Barnebey-Cheney type KE (BC-KE) and
Mine Safety Appliances (MSA) No. 85851 char-
coals, both of which have been widely used in
adsorbers. The data from small-scale investiga-
tions of these materials show that ignition tem-
peratures vary somewhat for various lots of the
same charcoal; initial ignition temperatures dif-
fered by 30°C for two lots of MSA chatcoal, while
subsequent ignition temperatures differed by 15
to 20°C. Ignition temperatures seem independent
of apparatus material (glass or metals such as
stainless steel) and of tubing size over the small
range (0.5 and 0.7 in. in diameter) studied. Initial
ignition temperature was unaffected by change in
air flow rate from 20 to 40 fpm, but subsequent
ignition occurred at temperatures 10 to 15°C lower
at the higher flow rates. Ignition temperatures
were lowered measurably (about 6°C) when moist
air was substituted for dry air at the same veloc-
ity. The ignition temperatures for the BC-KE
charcoals were increased by addition of iodine.

A most important finding in this study is that
charcoal from adsotbers which had been in service
for one year on the NS ‘“Savannah’’ showed igni-
tion temperatures 150 to 200°C lower than unex-
posed samples of the same charcoal. The reason
for this difference is not yet known.

155

In-pile tests have been conducted in an experi-
mental unit (see Fig. 17.3) designed for use in
the fuel melting facility in the ORR. This facility
and the first in-pile ignition test of this series
were described in a previous report.’ A total of
100 ignitions have been performed with ten ignition
cycles per position. Control of the position of the
UO, cylinder (from which fission products were
emitted to the charcoal adsorber) permitted study
at three levels of fission product concentration in
the charcoal; iodine concentrations corresponded
to 4.3, 5.0, and 7.0 w per square inch of charcoal
surface. These energy release rates are greater
by a factor of 8 than those expected in HFIR,
LOFT, or NPR adsotbers.

Ignition temperatures for the in-pile experiments
differed in several regards from those observed
in the laboratory experiments. Typical experiments
with a BC-KE charcoal showed that initial igni-
tion, which took place after the iodines were at
equilibrium, occurred at 336°C; this value is not
significantly different from the value 341°C which
is the average of ten fast ignitions in the same
apparatus ouf-of-pile. However, subsequent igni-
tions in the in-pile assembly occurred at tempera-
tures up to 40°C higher. This increase in ignition
temperature (which is quite unlike the laboratory
behavior) persisted even after the unit was re-
tracted to stop fission product (and iodine) gen-
When an in-pile ignition experiment was
resumed (in the retracted position) after a 45-day
lapse following an equipment malfunction, the
ignition temperature remained at some 20°C above
its laboratory value, even though virtually all
iodine activity had decayed. Some factor in addi-

eration.

tion to iodine and the short-lived fission products
seems responsible for a part of this temperature
increase.

Future in-pile experiments will be performed to
study the ignition temperature behavior of high-
ignition charcoals and impregnated charcoals. In
these experiments a controller will be used to
reproducibly control the heating rate of the ad-
sorber. Future out-of-pile experiments will include
the further development of a standard ignition ap-
paratus and the study of ignition characteristics of
various charcoals.

The previous report® gave results of an experi-
ment performed in the Containment Mockup Facility
(CMF) with stainless-steel-clad UO, irradiated to
a burnup of 1000 Mwd/ton. Data obtained in a
similar expetiment (run 4-11) with Zircaloy-clad
UC, irradiated to a burnup of 7000 Mwd/ton are
reported below.

The conditions used in this experiment were
quite close to those prevailing in the previous
high-burnup experiment.® The total pressure in
the CMF, furnished by a mixture of air and steam,
was about 29 psig before heating the fuel. Heating
of the fuel was started with a mixture of steam
and air flowing through the pressurized furnace
tube, but steam flow was discontinued before the
fuel temperature reached an estimated 2200°C be-
cause of steam condensation in the furnace tube.
Dry air flow continued during the balance of the
heating period (10 min total) and for 20 min there-
after. During most of the 20-min cooling period,
burning of the specimen was observed at irregular
intervals; such behavior has been observed with
previous Zircaloy-clad UO, specimens that had
been melted and then cooled in air.

The distribution of iodine observed in this ex-
periment is compared in Table 17.1 with the data
obtained with the 1000 Mwd/ton burnup fuel® (run
10-29). The distribution of four other important
fission products is similarly compared in Table
17.2. In both tables the observed differences are
not large enough to be considered significant
without further, confirmatory, data. The high trans-
port of iodine observed in the 7000 Mwd/ton experi-
ment (21.6% as compared with 9% for the 1000
Mwd/ton experiment and 6 to 10% in simulant ex-
periments} was an unexpectedly large difference.
The difference in iodine collection on plateout
samples is due, at least in part, to a larger number
of painted carbon-steel samples in run 4-11 as
compared with run 10-29. There appears to be no
obvious explanation for the smaller fraction of
in the condensate in the 7000 Mwd/ton
experiment.

ference in airborne I, Cs, Mo, and Ru. The air-
borne tellurium values are lower for the 7000

of the zirconium cladding, while the barium. and

BEHAVIOR OF i AND Hi IN THE CONTAINMENT

The Containment Research Installation (CRI)
has been constructed at Qak Ridge National Lab-
oratory for the investigation of fission product
release, transport, and plateout as a function of
burnup, fue! and containment temperature, time
at temperature, and atmospheric and containment
surface composition.

The primary objective of the initial experiments
in the CRI was to compare the deposition behavior
of molecular iodine (run 100) and HI (run 101) in
a stainless steel system under ambient conditions
of temperature and humidity and an internal air
pressure of 30 psig.

In run 100 an initial concentration of 2 mg/m

duced into the CRI containment vessel by com-
pressing a thin-wall stainless steel tube which
contained an iodine-filled glass ampule. An air

to transport iodine to the containment vessel.

with time, while the fractions which passed such

This program is intended to advance the tech-

colloidal dispersions by adsorption and filtration
techniques in order to increase the confidence
in the reliability of the effectiveness of various
air cleaning systems unader accident conditions.
As this confidence is achieved, a wider acceptance
of air cleaning systems as engineered safeguards
will be accomplished.

Results of these studies are repoited in detail

The test aerosol is prepared by striking an elec-

Prior experiments at room temperature have shown
that a moist atmosphere may reduce the efficiency
of the same filter medium toward the same test
aerosol to as low as 93% under ~95% relative
humidity.

The effect of moisture had not been anticipated
by reactor designers, and, because of its impli-
cations in case of reactor accidents, recent re-
search efforts have been directed toward defining
the mechanism of moisture in reducing filtration
efficiency. The effect of moisture may be due
to changes in the properties of the aerosol, changes
in the filter media, or both.

A difference has been noted in the physical
characteristics of aerosols produced under humid
and under diy conditions. Electron photomicro-
graphs of an aerosol produced under high relative
humidity reveal that the particles aie covered with
a thin film of unknown composition and that ag-
glomerates are in the form of chains (Fig. 18.1)
rather than clusters as observed under diy con-
ditions. Evidently the stability and filtration char-
acteristics of these two types of aerosols differ
in some respects.

Tests have established that activity profiles
obtained by filtration of moist and diy aerosols
through fibrous-filter analyzers ate quite different.
In a div atmosphere as much as 90% of the aerosol
passed through the fibrous-filter analyzer is re-
tained on the first fiber mat, whereas under high
humidity conditions a flat activity profile is ob-
tained as a result of more even distribution of
particles on the successive fiber mats. Inter-
pretation of results under wet conditions can be
taken to mean that the fibrous filter mat efficien-
cies are being reduced, or moisture is affecting
the aerosol in some way, making it more difficult
to filter, or both. Ia any case, a flat distribution
of particles through the filter pack would result.

To resolve the anomalous filtration behavior

in the presence of moisture, a series of experi-

ments was made in which an aerosol generated
in a high-humidity air atmosphere was sampled
by two filter packs. One pack was held at room
temperature, and the fibers were saturated with
water vapor from the high-humidity carrier gas.
To reduce the moisture content of the fibers, the
other pack was heated to 100°C under similar
conditions. In another set of experiments the
acrosol was generated in a dry air atmosphere and
once more sampled with two packs. One pack
was dry, and the other was wetted by pretreating
it with 20% relative humidity air immediately prior
to its use in an experiment. The conclusion
drawn from these experiments was that moisture
does not affect the efficiency of a fibrous filter
but that it influences the physical properties of
the aerosol, making it more difficult to filter.
However, not all the iesults from these experi-
ments were equally unambiguous. At aerosol con-
centrations estimated to be at the level of 10°
nuclei/cm?, the activity profile obtained in the
presence of a wet atmosphere was not character-
istically flat. It is probable that at these higher
concentrations, agglomeration will occur regardless
of the presence of moisture. Study of the effects
of moisture is continuing.

Construction of a recirculating aerosol facility
for laboratory aerosol studies has been proceeding
parallel to the moisture effects study just de-
scribed. This recirculating facility consists of
a 100-liter stainless steel vessel with associated
piping which will allow the behavior of an aerosol,
to be
studied under a variety of accident conditions
ranging from temperatures of 25 to 120°C and

EXAMINATION OF PARTICULATE AEROSOLS
WITH THE FIBROUS-FIL TER ANALYZER

The fibrous-filter analyzer (FFA) is being de-
veloped for measuring the characteristics of ra-
dioactive aerosols in terms of their response to
filtration processes by determining their distri-
bution vs depth in a filter under carefully con-

trolled conditions. Moisture does not significantly

162

affect the performance of the FFA, although the
test aerosol itself was affected. The filtration
efficiency data agreed well with the theoretical
treatment of filtration developed by Torgeson. The
analyzer was calibrated against particles 150 to
1500 A in diameter, measured by electron micros-
copy.

A summary report on this project has been com-
pleted, ® and only a brief review of the subject
material will be presented here.

The FFA is an ““in situ’’ analytical device
which characterizes radioactive aerosols dynam-
ically by particle response to the major processes
of filtration: diffusion, interception, and inertial
impaction. The concept of the FFA originated
from a note by Sisefsky,® who determined the
penetration of ‘‘fallout’’ material in a commercial
filter by radioassay by peeling off layers of the
filters with pressure-sensitive cellophane tape.
By contrast, the fibrous-filter analyzer is made
from uniform-diameter Dacron fiber (which is formed
into a uniform web by a carding machine) into a
layered structure to facilitate separation of the
fiber bed into discrete layers for radioassay. The
test aerosol containing ®°Zn was produced by
using a Tesla coil to generate a spark between
two preirradiated zinc electrodes. A stream of
air passing over the electrodes carried the aerosol
through the system containing the filters. Elec-
tron micrographs of samples of the aerosol col-
lected on carbon-covered Millipore membrane filters
yielded information regarding the size of the par-
ticles. Depending on the experimental conditions,
aerosols have been prepared over the size range
50 to 10,000 A (0.05 to 1 wu).

The data were analyzed graphically by means
of the Chen equation’ to estimate single-fiber
efficiencies. These were compared with theoretical
fiber efficiencies calculated according to Torge-
who used an adaptation of Davies’®

son, ® inter

ception and impaction theory combined with a new

theory was selected by Whitby? as that which
agreed most closely with experimental data ac-
cumulated in numerous researches. A computer
program developed specifically for these FFA
calculations is given in Appendix II of the sum-
mary report. >

Calibration of the FFA was performed by com-
paring particle sizes estimated from electron pho-
tomicrographs of the inlet and outlet aerosols with
those calculated according to the Torgeson treat-
ment. The best correlations were observed in
dry experiments and at low velocities. Additional
calibrations will be performed at the University
of Minnesota under a subcontract.

DISTINGUISHING IODINE FORMS
AT HIGH TEMPERATURES AND HUMIDITIES

R. E. Adams
Zell Combs

R. L.. Bennett
W. H. Hinds

In the event of a nuclear accident, radioiodine
is the most hazardous fission product which may
be released. Iodine may exist in elemental or in
chemically combined species in molecular form
or as aerosols dispersed on particulate material
from the fuel or structural members of the reactor
core. The various species exhibit different be-
havior toward removal, and information is needed
on their behavior in order to design adequate gas
cleaning systems. A program is in progress to
develop tools for distinguishing the various vapor
forms of iodine which occur in the laboratory and
in larger-scale experiments. The identifying de-
vices should be capable of remote operation and
preferably should keep their effectiveness under
extreme conditions of temperature and humidity
that may occur in a reactor accident.

The analytical devices most commonly used for
radioiodine studies are composite diffusion tubes
and May packs. The adverse effects of high
humidity on the response of diffusion tubes and
the application of selective desiccants and im-
pregnated charcoal linings in improving their per-
formance have been reported.'!''? Extensive
tests of May packs under elevated temperatures
and high-humidity conditions, such as those ex-
pected in the LOFT experiments, are in progress.

10% T. Whitby, ASHRAE J. 7(9), 56-65 (1965).

The May pack is an assembly of filter materials
and adsorbent beds intended to separate iodine
forms of different reactivity or adsorption tend-
ency. Since high specificity is difficult to ob-
tain for wide ranges of temperature and humidity,
considerable testing is needed to establish the
range of reliability of the optimum components
of the pack. Initial emphasis has been placed
on a configuration suggested for the LOFT pro-
gram. This arrangement consists of a sequence
of three high-efficiency filters, eight silver screens,
five charcoal-impregnated filters, two ¥,-in. char-
coal beds, and finally one more high-efficiency
filter section. The initial filter section is in-
tended to remove particulate forms of iodine, the
silver screens remove elemental iodine, and the
charcoal filters retain the iodine species which
are not removed by the silver screens but which
are easily adsorbed by charcoal-impregnated filter
papers. The more penetrating forms, such as
methyl iodide, are adsorbed in the charcoal beds.
The last high-efficiency filter section is designed
to trap any charcoal particles which might be
dislodged from the beds.

Duplicate May packs were usually tested with
two associated diffusion tube assemblies, one
at room temperature under dry conditions and the
other at the same conditions as the May packs.
The tests were made at 90°C with a superficial
face velocity of 10 fpm. Dry or 90% relative-
humidity air streams were used in tests with
elemental iodine and methyl iodide.

Results and discussion of 2 large number of
these tests have been reported. !?

Briefly, the effect of moisture on penetration
of methyl iodide into the pack is illustrated in
Fig. 18.2. Under diy conditions the CH,I was
about evenly distributed between the charcoal-
loaded filters and the first charcoal bed, while
at 90% relative humidity most of the CH,I was
swept into the beds. The sharp separation of a

REACTIONS OF IODINE VAPOR
WITH ORGANIC MATERIALS

R. E. Adams

R. L. Bennett

When radioiodine is released into & closed en-
vironment, such as in a containment test facility,
it has been noted that a genemlly small, but pos-
sibly significant, fraction may appear in the form
of methyl iodide and other alkyl iodides.!* In
an accident situation, methyl iodide may be formed
in the containment atmosphere by gas-phase re-
actions with organic contaminants, or on the var-
ious types of surfaces within the containment
vessel with subsequent desorption into the gas
phase. This investigation, which is an extension
of some earlier efforts, '®'!'% is concerned with
the methods of formation of methyl iodides to
avoid, if possible, conditions or materials con-
ducive to its formation in a reactor system.

Possible reactions between painted surfaces and
elemental iodine to produce methyl iodide have
been investigated.

Preliminary work has been done using gas chro-
matography, with electron capture detectors for
analysis of the reaction products. Calibration
of methyl iodide response has been made with
samples in the gas and in the liquid phase (cy-
clohexane).

The first experiments were performed using a
reaction vessel painted with two coats of Amercoat
64 primer and fwo coats of Amercoat 66 seal coat

chromatograms with about six major peaks, none
of which fell near the methyl iodide peak. About
1 mg of elemental iodine was placed in another
painted vessel and heated at 100°C. Chroma-
tographic analysis indicated the presence of methyl!
iodide, with a total mass in the vapor phase of
about 1075 mg. Additional studies will be made
with coating formulations of interest in the LOFT
program. When a dual detection chromatograph
which is on order becomes available, it will be
used fo examine the paint and reaction product
vapors in more detail. These techniques will
also be employed to investigate the reaction of
iodine with trace organic components in the gas
phase.

BEHAVIOR OF FISSION PRODUCTS
IN GAS-LIQUID SYSTEMS

R. E. Adams B. A. Soldano
Ww. T. Ward

Removal of fission product dispersions from
containment atmospheres by application of liguid
systems has been proposed as an engineered safe-
guard. Examples of these systems are pressure
suppression pools and coatainment sprays. An
experimental program has been initiated to study
both the chemical and physical aspects of such
gas-liquid systems. A study of the adsorption
of gases, or particles in gases, by a liquid in a
spray system involves a situation wherein there
exists a large amount of gas and a relatively small
amount of liquid under highly dynamic conditions.
On the other hand, a study of fission product
trapping in a pressure suppression pool represents
a situation in which there is a very large amount
of water under relatively static conditions in con-
tact with a small amount of gas.
systems

Since the two
involve the two extremes of the gas-
liquid spectrum, the study has been divided into
two parts. This dualistic approach will hopefully
permit extrapolation of information to intermediate
conditions and will allow one to fix experimental
conditions such that a chemical-physical descrip-
tion of our experiments becomes feasible.

An experimental study of the efficacy of water
sprays in the removal of released fission products
in reactor containment vessels requires a knowl-
edge of the hydrodynamics of these systems as
well as an understanding of their kinematic be-
havior. Since single liquid drops under highly
dynamic conditions constitute a primary element
of the spray itself, we propose to study the be-
havior of liquid drops suspended in a low-velocity
wind 1.17 Such a tunnel! can be used to
simulate the gas-liquid environment accompanying
a fission release accident. Some of the pertinent
variables are drop size, height of fall, time of
contact, composition of both gas and liquid phases,

tunne

pressure, temperature, and the volume of tunnel
gases.

The advantages of a wind tunnel in such dy-
namic studies are, in part, as follows:

1. The time of contact of each drop with the gas

stream can be widely varied.

Drops suspended by the gas stream in the tun-
nel can be directly observed and photographed
so that shape and oscillation factors can be
properly accounted for.

Random convection effects are eliminated.

Close temperature control can be achieved in
the working area.

Homogeneity of the gas mixtures and therefore
reproducibility of results is, in principle, at-
tainable with such a probe.

The second part of this program involves a study
of the behavior of fission products in a pressure

sion pools during and subsequent to a reactor
accident. Negotiations are under way with General
Electric, San Jose, for a subcontract under which
they would perform theoretical and laboratory in-
vestigations of the effectiveness of pressure sup-
pression pools for fission product trapping.

At present, engineering designs have been com-
pleted on both the wind tunnel and the supporting
drop collection equipment. It is estimated that
approximately 75% of the parts have been fabri-
cated.

Prior to initiation of the wind tunnel investi-
gation, studies were undertaken to determine the
efficiency of various solutions in removing methyl
iodide from air. The experimental procedure con-

through a 1 Y -in.-diam glass column containing 800
ml of the solution at approximately 25°C (depth
of solution = 28 in.) for approximately 2 hr, fol-
lowed by a “‘clean’ air sparge of from 16 to 20 hr.
The air entering the bottom of the column is
dispersed through a porous glass disk. The air
leaving the column is passed through two or three
beds of iodine-impregnated activated charcoal to

e

remove the methyl iodide that is not captured by
the solution. Jodine-131 tracer is used; the ra-
dioactivity of the charcoal and solution indicates
the iodine distribution. All the activity on the
charcoal was found to be in the first bed.

A comparison of the efficiencies of the various
solutions tested to date is given in Table 18.1.
Tests of other solutions are planned, as well as
tests to determine the effect of increasing the
temperature.

HIGH-TEMPERATURE BEHAVIOR
OF GAS-BORNE FISSION PRODUCTS.
TELLURIUM DIOXIDE

M. D. Silverman A. P. Malinauskas

Recent experimental studies? indicate an en-

hanced volatility of a rather broad class of metal
oxides in the presence of water vapor. This en-
hancement is believed to be the result of the
generalized reaction

oxide(s) + H,0(g) = hydroxide(g) , €9)

in which the hydroxide so formed is stable only
at high temperatures. The present investigations
are directed toward a study of this reaction.

The research has been initiated using tellurium
dicxide, Ted, as the compound under investi-
gation. Although reaction (1) has yet to be un-
equivocally established in this case, the increase
in the apparent vapor pressure, due to water vapor,
has been experimentally demonstrated over the
temperature range 600 to 700°C. *%*® Our imme-
diate objective is to verify these data and to
extend the temperature range.

The transport method (also called the **transfec”’
or ‘transpiration’ method) has been chosen for
use in the current research. In brief, the pro-
cedure involves saturating a suitable carrier gas
with the material under study in one section of
the apparatus and allowing this substance to be
transported and collected in another region. A
detailed description of the experimental and the-
oretical aspects can be found elsewhere, '8~40

Since the program has only recently been ini-
tiated, much of the work has been concerned thus
far with the design, construction, and testing of
the apparatus itself. Data obtained from two of
the preliminary runs, however, rather dramatically
demonstrate the effect of water vapor on the vol-
atility of TeO,. These data ace presented in

THE CASCADE IMPACTOR AS A TOOL
FOR THE STUDY OF SIZE DISTRIBUTION
OF FISSION PRODUCT AEROSOLS

G. W. Parker H. Buchholz???

Cascade impactors?? are instruments used to

separate aerosols into fractions of a discrete range
of particle size. They are frequently used for
analyzing radioactive aerosols to collect a range
of size groups which may later be examined for
their radioactivity. Several theoretical and ex-
perimental studies of cascade impactors have been
reported. 23727 Jmpactors are limited to relatively
large particles, usually above 0.5 pu, and, in order
to make this instrument genuinely useful in nu-
clear safety research, it is necessary to extend
their range to particles below 0.1 i. The basic
theory of these devices is quite simple. When
a gas jet carrying particles is directed toward a
surface, all particles having sufficient inertia in
the first stage will leave their stream lines and
settle on the surface. Smaller particles will re-

main within the jet stream. In the next stage the

accelerated to a higher velocity. The probability
of smaller particles settling is thus increased.

If the pressure within the cascade impactor is
lowered until the particle diameter is comparable
to the mean free path of the gas molecules, there
are fewer collisions between particles and gas

slip effect, described by the Cunningham correction,
the cascade impactor becomes more efficient for
separating smaller particles. Using an equation
based on May’s theory, ?? we calculated the size
of particles that have a 50% probability of de-

positing on each stage of the Andersen sampler.

REACTION OF MOLECULAR IODINE
AND OF METHYL IODIDE
WITH SODIUM THIOSULFATE SPRAYS

G. W. Parker
W. J. Martin

G. E. Creek
N. R. Horton

Addition of chemicals to water used in reactor
containment misting sprays to aid in the rapid
scavenging of radioiodine from steam-filled reactor
containment shells has been proposed in many
recent applications for power reactor construction
permits presented to the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion. Pure water sprays do .not provide the de-
sired iodine removal rate.

The removal of heat in most large reactor de-
signs is effected primarily by air-recirculation
cooling units, and the removal of inorganic vapor
forms of iodine (I, and HI) is the major require-
ment of the sprays. Griffiths 28 described a method
for predicting the rate of iodine removal from
gases by sprays and presented most of the pa-
rameters for making such calculations in a com-
prehensive report which was summarized in Nuclear
Safety.?® The most useful experimental exami-
nation of Griffiths’ theory was performed by Tay-
tor,®® using glass columns in which he varied
both the liquid flow rate and the gas velocity.
From these experiments the mass transfer process

liquid drop containing reducing material, is chemi-
cally altered to the form of iodide by the reducing
agent. Thus, there is a sharp reduction in the
vapor pressure of iodine near the liquid surface,
and, since the total quantity of iodine available
from a reactor is almost negligible (by comparison
with the quantity of reducing agent in the spray),
there is essentially no change in efficiency as
the drop continues to fall. The iodine present
as HI is even more soluble in the droplet, and
it should be removed at a faster rate than I,

In order to test the spray removal concept undet
conditions used in fission product transport studies
and in order to be able to assess the limitations
of the process for the nonreactive forms of iodine,
we decided to carry out spray experiments in the
Containment Mockup Facility (CMF) with charac
teristic forms of radioiodine. The design of the
spray system allowed very small quantities of
liquid to be used, and therefore the liquid-to-gas
ratio could be adjusted to teactor containment pro-
portions.

The spray system chosen for test contained six
atomizing nozzles, each of which delivered 0.1
liter/min at 80 psig. Since the test containment
was small (180 liters), the sprays were generally
operated for only 15 to 30 sec. Operation for
30 sec produced a liquid volume of 0.3 liter or
1/600 of the containment tank volume. A con-
centration of Na,§,0, of 0.1 mole/liter (1.6%)
was used in these tests.

Test with Molecular lodine (1,)

The conditions selected for the molecular io-
dine test were typical of those used in previous
CMF steam-air runs. The initial pressure was
about 35 psig, of which about 20 psig was due
to steam. The tank atmosphere temperature’ was
about 130°C at the injection time, and the cooling
rate without sprays was about 30°hr. Since the
natural removal rate for molecular iodine in the
CMF (ty, = 30 min) was fairly well known, the
effect of thiosulfate sprays on the removal rate
could be readily calculated. We found that ad-
dition of sodium thiosulfate spray at a rate of
1/300 of the containment tank volume per minute
decreased the half-life of disappearance of I, from
the tank atmosphere to 3.9 sec. This value agreed
quite well with the calculated value of 2.6 sec
for the half-time of removal of I, by 200-x droplets
of 0.1 mNa,S,0,.
Tests with Methyl lodide (CHI)

In two experiments conducted in a similar man-
ner to the molecular iodine experiment described
above, methyl iodide injected at similar concen-
trations (2 mg/m?) was first exposed to steam
and to the condensation process and then to
sodium thiosulfate spray. The results were en-
couraging, but the rate of removal of CH,I is
only a fraction of the corresponding iodine rate.
However, the CH,I removal rate is of sufficient
magnitude to warrant its consideration in safety
analysis calculations. The calculated half-times
for depletion of CH ,I were approximately 2 hr in
one run and 4 hr in the other.

Conclusions

A model for removing reactive iodine by thio-
sulfate sprays was tested in the stainless steel
CME tank.
culated and the experimental iodine removal rates

Excellent agreement between the cal-

was found.

Tests of methyl iodide removal with Na,S,0,
sprays gave encouraging results but showed much
slower removal rates than the corresponding io-
dine rates. More efficient scavenging agents will

be required for methyl iodide removal.

STUDIES OF CSE-TYPE FISSION
PRODUCT SIMULATION

Fission product aerosols will be simulated in
experiments to be performed in the Containment
Systems Experiment (CSE) at Hanford using a dif-
ferent technique from that used at ORNL. Rogers 3!
pointed out that, in the 30,000-ft® CSE contain-
ment tank, use of irradiated fuel to furnish real-
istic fission product levels is impractical. Neither
is it feasible to use simulated high-burnup fuel
pellets of the type used in the CMF3? and in

the NSPP.33 The simulation technique devised
for the CSE experiments, described by Hilliard
and McCormack,3* involves vaporization of suit-
able quantities of fission product elements con-
taining radioactive tracers and passing the vapor
over molten unirradiated UO, before it enters the
containment vessel. In order to determine how
well the aerosols produced by this techaique imi-

tate those produced by overheated high-burnup

fuel, it will be necessary to make direct com-
parisons under similar conditions. We plan to
do this in the CMF, where experiments with

high-burnup fuel have already been performed, and
perhaps later in the Containment Research Instal-
lation (CRI).

We have completed the design, construction, and
preliminary testing of equipment for performing
CSE-type simulation experiments either in the CMF
or the CRI (the fuel-melting cans of these sys-
tems are interchangeable).
modify

It was necessary to
the experimental arrangement described
by Hilliard and McCormack3* rather extensively
in order to adapt it to the CMF-CRI fuel meltdown
arrangement, but the differences relate mainly to
methods of getting the vaporized materials into
the pressurized meltdown furnace. In addition,
we chose to provide a steam-air environment in
the vicinity of the molten UO, and in the con-
tainment tank, both at 30 1b total pressure, rather
than air, because our recent experiments with
high-burnup fuel were all carried out using a steam-
air atmosphere.

As shown by Fig. 18.5, two ribbon heating units
are inserted through the glass envelope, which
is fitted to the end of the quartz meltdown tube
by means of a tapered joint. A platinum ribbon
which can be operated at a temperature between
1400 and 1600°C in the furnace tube atmosphere
will be used to vaporize tellurium (in the form
of TeO,), cesium (introduced as Cs ,CO,), and
ruthenium metal. Cesium will probably be vapor-
ized as the metal but will quickly be reoxidized
in the furnace atmosphere. Ruthenium metal will
undoubtedly be converted to a volatile oxide, RuO

ribbon (% in. wide and Y in. long, V shaped),
operates in a helium atmosphere in a small glass
envelope having a Y ¢-in.-diam hole through which
helium carrying the vaporized material flows into
the furnace tube. A mixture of BaCO, and finely
divided zirconium metal is placed on the tantalum
ribbon to increase the volatility of barium by re-
ducing the oxide to the more volatile metal.

Iodine in the form of I, is introduced through
a side arm attached to the outside pressurized
tube extension. A glass capsule containing the
I, is inserted in a Teflon-lined side arm, and it
is crushed while a stream of air flows through
the tube to carry the iodine into the inner (fur-
nace) tube.

Finally, steam is introduced through a ball joint
at the end of the glass envelope. Water supplied
under pressure at a carefully controlled rate is
converted to steam by a miniature water vaporizer
located in the outer pressurized shell, quite close
to the ball-joint entrance to the furnace tube.

Preliminary testing has centered on achieving
satisfactory volatilization of barium, the least
volatile species expected to be used in these ex-
periments. We found that a temperature of 1800°C
was needed to volatize half the barium activity
from a BaCO ,-Zr mixture in a flowing helium at-
mosphere.

RETENTION OF RADIOACTIVE METHYL
IODIDE BY IMPREGNATED CHARCOALS

R. E. Adams J. D. Dake??®
R. D. Ackley J. M. Gimbel 3°
F. V. Hensley

Methyl iodide, which is more difficult to trap
than elemental iodine, may be generated in re-
actor accidents. It readily penetrates beds of
the common types of activated charcoal at ambient
temperatures except when the relative humidity
is low. However, certain specially impregnated
(iodized) charcoals have been observed to have the
capability of effectively trapping radioactive methyl
iodide from air streams of fairly high relative hu-
midity at temperatures as high as 115°F.37:38
These charcoals, which are impregnated with one

or more iodine-containing substances, appear to
possess this unusual capability as the result of
an isotopic exchange mechanism. To obtain in-
formation pertaining to the applicability of im-
pregnated charcoals under various reactor accident
situations is the objective of this work, which
has been reported in more detail elsewhere. 32:40

A
various laboratory-impregnated charcoals and on
various types of commercially impregnated char-
coal were performed. The manner of conducting
these tests is illustrated in Fig. 18.6. The tests
are made at ambient temperature and pressure
and usually at around 70% relative humidity. Four
commercial products were observed to be effective
for CH, trapping. They are BC-727 (from
Barnebey-Cheney), MSA-85851 and MSA-24207 (from
Mine Safety Appliances Company), and G601 (from
North American Caibon, Inc.). Results from these
room-temperature tests for the four commercial
charcoals are given in Table 18.3. A number of
laboratory-impregnated charcoals also gave prom-
ising results, although at present none of them
are regarded to have any especial advantage over
the commercial charcoals mentioned.

The conditions corresponding to the earlier
tests *® and those discussed above are less severe
than the conditions which have been postulated
for the atmosphere in a reactor containment ves-

sel in which steam is released, causing consider-
able elevation of temperature, pressure, and hu-
midity. Consequently, tests have also been made
under the more severe conditions characteristic
of steam-air systems. Methyl iodide labeled with
CH, is employed. Typical results are shown
in Fig. 18.7, wheie the deleterious effect of very
high relative humidity is displayed. The use of
charcoal laboratory impregnated with triethylene-
diamine was prompted by results of United King-
dom researchers. *? To the extent they have been
tested, the other commercial charcoals identified
