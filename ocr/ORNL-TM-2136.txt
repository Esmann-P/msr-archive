ABSTRACT

Graphite behavior under Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor
(MSBR) conditions is reviewed and its influence on MSBR
performance estimated. Based on the irradiation behavior
of small-sized graphite specimens, a permissible reactor
exposure for MSER graphite is about 3 x 1022 neutrons/cm
(E > 50 kev). The stresses generated in the graphite due
to differential growth and thermal gradients are relieved
by radiation-induced creep, such that the maximum stress
during reactor exposure is less than 1000 psi for reactor
designs having a peak core power density of about 100
kw/liter and reactor exposures less than about 2-1/2 years.
The corresponding power costs for single-fluid MSBR's :
would be about 3.1 mills/kwhr(e) based on a capital charge
rate of 12% per year and an 80% load factor. Experimental
data on graphite behavior also indicate that graphites
with improved dimensional stebility under irradietion cen
be developed, which would lead to improved reactor per-
formance.

2

The deposition of fission products on graphite does
not appear to be large (10 to 35% of the "noble-metal
fission products based on MSRE experience); taking into
account graphite replacement every two years, fission -
product deposition reduces the MSER breeding ratio by
ebout 0.002. Also, it appears that xenon poisoning can
be kept at a 0.5% fraction poisoning level by using pyro-
lytic carbon as & pore impregnant which seals the surface
of MSBR graphite and/or by efficient gas stripping of the
fuel salt fluid by injection end removal of helium gas
bubbles. : : oo

It is concluded that good MSER performance can be
obtained by using graphite having combined properties
presently demonstrated by small-size samples, and that
development of MSBR graphite having such properties is
feasible.
 

 

1. INTRODUCTION

Recent experimental results concerning the physical behavior of
graphite during reactor irradiations have indicated that significant
dimensional changes can take place at exposures of interest in Molten-
Salt Breeder (MSBR) systems. These results indicate the need to evaluate
graphite behavior under MSBR conditions, to estimate what constitutes a
permissible reactor exposure for the graphite, to determine the influence
of core power density and graphite replacement costs on MSBR performance,
and to initiate an experimental program for the purpose of developing
improved graphite. Also, in assessing overall reactor performance, a
nurber of other interrelated problems are involved. For example, the
deposition of fission products on graphite has an adverse effect on reac-
tor performance, and this deposition behavior in an MSBR environment
needs to be determined. Thus, the purpose of this study is to summarize
"and ‘'evaluate presently available information concerning graphite behavior
and properties as they relate to MSER operation. Further, investigations
are proposed which may lead to development of improved graphites. Topics
specifically treated in this report include the behavior of graphite
under reactor radiation conditions; the evaluation of irradiation dats;
the stresses generated in graphite under MSBR conditions; the penetration
of graphite by gases and salts; the sealing of graphite pores; the depo-
sition of fission products on graphite; the effects of gas stripping and
of graphite permesbility on 135%e neutron poisoning; the influence of
graphite dimensional changes on MSBR fuel cycle performance, mechanical
design, and power costs; the effect on MSER Puel cycle performance of
fission product deposition on graphite; .and a proposed program for devel-
oping improved graphites which includes physical, mechanical, chemical,
fabrication, and irradiation studies.

As mentioned &bove, the effect of graphite behavior on reactor per-
formance influences reactor design. Until recently, the term MSBR was
applied to a two-fluid concept, in which fuel salt containing fissile
material was kept separate from fertile-containing fluid by means of
graphite plumbing. Such a concept is given in reference 1,which presents

design information on a 1000-Mw(e) plant employing four reactor modules,
each module generating the equivalent of 250.Mw(e). The core of each’
reactor uses graphite fuel cells in the form of reentrant tubes brazed
to metal pipes. The pipes are welded into fuel-supply and discharge
plenums in the bottom of the reactor vessel. The fertile salt fills the
interstices between fuel cells as well as a blanket region around the
core. Such a reactor is termed a’ two-fluid MSER.

Also considered here is a single-fluid MSBR, in which the fissile
and fertile salts are mixed together in carrier salt but which is other-
wise similar to the two-fluid MSBR. Such a concept does not require
graphite to serve as fuel plumbing, which is desirable from the viewpoint
of reactor operation. However, in order to operate as a breeder, a fuel
processing scheme is required that can rapidly and economically retain
233pgy outside the core region. Recent chemical developments indicate?
the feasibility of such a process. Thus, both the two-fluid and single-
fluid MSBR's are referred to in the following sections. However, no
differentiation is made to items which apply equally well to both reactor

concepts.

2. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

When graphite is exposed to fast neutron doses, it tends to contract
initially, with the rate of contraction decreasing with exposure until a
minimum volume is attained; further exposure tends to cause volume expan-
sion, with the rate of expansion increasing rapidly at neutron doses gbove
gbout 3 x 1022 neutrons/em® (E > 50 kev) in graphite tested to date. This
behavior is due to atomic displacements which take place when graphite is
exposed to fast neutrons, and is dependent upon the source and fabrication
history of the material and also the exposure temperature. Irradiation
results for different grades of graphite have shown that gross volume
changes are a function of crystallite arrangement as well as size of the

individual crystallites. The initial decrease in graphite volume with

reactor exposure is attributed to the closing of voids which were gener-
ated in the graphite during fsbrication. These voids (as microcracks)

 

2MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Feb. 29, 1968, ORNL-425k.

 
 

afford accommodation of the internal shearing strains without causing
gross volume growth which would otherwise take place due to the differ-
ential growth rates of coke particles. Once the original microcracks

are closed, however, this accommodation no longer exists, and macroscopic
growth occurs with increasing exposure.

“The rapid volume expansion of graphite observed at very high reactor
exposures indicates that for these conditions the intermal straining is
not accommodated by particle deformation, but by cracking. Examinations
show that this cracking generally takes place in the interparticle, or
binder region. Thus, it appears that the binder region has little capaclty
‘to accommodate or control particle strain and thus fractures because of
buildup of mechanical stresses. This indicates that graphites with im-
proved radiation resistance might be obtained by developing graphites
having little or no binder content, and there are experimental results
which appear to encourage such development. Experimental data also indi-
cate that improved radiation resistence is associated with isotropic
graphites made up of large crystallites. Consequently, a research and
development program aimed at producing improved graphite would emphasize
development of graphite having large crystallite sizes and little or no
binder content. Such a program would involve physical, chemical, mechan-
ical, fabrication, and irradiation studies, end could be expected to
develop graphites with permissible fast neutron exposures of 5 to
10 x 1022 neutrons/cn® (E > 50 kev).

Volume changes in graphite during irradiation can influence reactor
performance characteristics and thus affect MSBR design specifications.
Consistent with the desire to maintain low permeability of the graphite
to gases, obtain high nuclear performance during MSBR operation, and to
simplify core design features, the maximum permissible graphite exposure
~ was limited to that which causes the graphite to expand back to its original
volume. . On this basis, and considering results obtained to date with
present-day graphites, the permissible exposure under MSBR conditions is
estimated to be about 3 x 102 nvt (E > 50 kev) at an effective tempera~
ture of T00°C. More specifically, at a peak core power density of 100
kw/liter under MSBR operating temperatures, return of the graphite to its
original volume corresponds to about 2.5 years of reactor operation at
90% load factor. | |

Neutron flux gradients in the MSER will lead to differential volume
changes in graphite components, and if the graphite is restrained from
free growth, stresses are generated. The magnitude of the stress depends
on the fast neutron flux distribution and also on the radiation-induced
creep of the graphite. Based on a single-fluid MSER design in which the
peak power density is 100 kw/liter and where the graphite shape is repre-
sented by an annular graphite cylinder having an external radius of 5 cm
and an internal radius of. 1.5 cm, the maximm calculated stress in the
graphite during a.2.5-year reactor exposure was less than T00 pel due to
spatially symmetric neutron flux variations, and less than 240 psi due to
asymmetric flux variations (£lux variations around the tube periphery).
Since MSBER graphite is estimated to have a tensile strength of about 5000
psi, the sbove stresses due to changes in graphite dimensions do not
appear to be excessive. For, the above conditions, the net change (decrease)
in the length of the graphite cylinder is estimated to be about 1.66, an
amount which does not appear to introduce significant core design diffi-
culties. -

Graphite for an MSBR should have low penetration by both gas and salt,
in order that performance characteristics of the system remain high. If
neutron poisoning due to 185%¥e 1s to be limited to 0.5% fraction poisons
by diffusional resistance of the graphite alone, a materiel is needed in
which the xenon diffusion coefficient is about 10 2 £t2/hr. The most
promising of several epproaches for producing such a graphite is that of
sealing the surface pores with pyrolytic carbon or graphite. Experi-
mental results indicete that graphite sealed in this manner has a dif-
fusion coefficient of about 10° ££2/nr (associated with the surface seal),
and that this seal can be maintained even though some thermal cycling
occurs. Alternatively, neutron poisoning could be maintained at low
levels by efficlent stripping of fission gases from the fuel salt with
helium, and if this is accomplished, an increase in graphite permeebility
during reactor exposure may be permissible. . Due to the nonwetting
characteristics of molten fluoride salts, penetration of graphite by

salts does not appear to be a problem.

Fission products other than gases also have access to the graphite.
Retention by the graphite of fission products could significantly reduce
 

 

the nuclear performance of MSER systems. However, tests conducted in the
Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) have demonstrated that only & small
fraction of the total fission products generated accumulate on the graph-
ite. The primary interaction between MSRE graphite and fissioning fuel
salt is the partiel deposition (about 10-35%) of fission products that
form relatively unstable fluorides. Of the "noble-metal" fission products
which deposited, over 99% of the associated activity was within 5 mils of
the graphite surface. In no case was there permestion of fuel salt into
the graphite or chemical damage to the graphite. Test results can be
interpreted such that the percentage of the noble metals deposited on
graphite depends on the ratio of graphite surface to metal surface in the
fuel system, with deposition on graphite decreasing with decreasing ratio
of graphite-to-metal surface. Finally, the MSRE results indicate that
significant fractions of the noble-metal fission products appear in the
ges phase in the fuel pump bowl. If these fission products can be re-
moved ‘from MSBR's by gas stripping, such a process would provide a con-
venient means for their removal.

Based on the results obtained in the MSRE and taking into account
the higher metal/graphite surface area in an MSBR relative to the MSRE,
it is estimated that deposition of fission products on the graphite in
an MSER would reduce the breeding ratio by ebout 0.002 on the average if
graphite were replaced every two years, and about 0.004 if replaced every
four years. Thus, although complete retention of the noble-metal fission
products on core graphite would lead to a significant reduction in MSER
breeding ratio, the deposition behavior inferred from MSRE results corre-
sponds to only a small reduction in MSBR performance.

Graphite dimensional changes due to exposure in an MSBR can alter
the relative volume fractions of moderator, fuel salt, and fertile salt
in the reactor. Such changes influence the design of a two-fluid MSER
more than a single-fluid reactor, since in the latter the fertile and
fissile materials are mixed together and their ratio does not change
when the graphite volume changes. By constructing a two-fluid reactor

such that the fissile and fertile materials are confined to channels
within the graphite assemblies and the spaces between graphite assemblies
are filled with helium, changes in graphite volume fraction lead largely

T

to relative volume change in the helium space. Such volume changes have
only a small effect on fuel cycle performance and on power distribution.
In a single-fluid MSBR, graphite dimensional changes would have little
effect on nuclear performance since the fissile and fertile salt volumes
are equally affected. Also, the ability to independently adjust fissile
and fertile material concentrations in both two-fluid and single-fluid
MSBER's permits adjustment in reactor performance as changes in graphite
volume occur. Thus, little change in nuclear performance is expected
because of radiation damage to graphite, so long as the graphite volume
does. not increase much beyond its initiasl value and the graphite diffusion
coefficient to gases remains low during reactor exposure (the latter con-
dition neglects the possibility of removing xenon efficiently by gas
stripping).

A limit on the permissible exposure of the graphite can have a sig-
nificant influence on reactor power costs. If there were no exposure
limit, the average core power density corresponding to the minimum cost
would be in excess of 80 kw/liter. However, if a limit exists, high
power density can lead to high cost because of graphite replacement cost.
At the same time, decreasing the core power density leads to an increase
in capital cost and fuel cycle cost. Thus, a limit on permissible graph-
ite exposure generally requires a compromise between various cost items,
with core power density chosen on the basis of power cost. The optimum
power density also varies with MSER concept, since only graphite requires
replacement in a single-fluid MSER, while both the reactor vessel and
graphite appear to require replacement in a two-fluid MSER because of the
complexity of constructing the latter core. Further, reactor pover out-
age due solely to graphite replacement requirements can be a significant
cost factor. However, if graphite were replaced at time intervals no
less than two years, it appears feasible to do the replacement operation
during normal turbine maintenance periods, such that no effective down-
time is assigned to graphite replacement. A two-year time interval is
associated with an average power density in the power-producing "core"
of ebout ko kw/liter. For the sbove "reference" conditions, the single-
fluid MSER has power costs about 0.35 mill/kvhr(e) lower than the two-
fluid MSBR. Doubling the permissible graphite exposure [To a value of
6 x 1022 nvt (E >.50 kev)/ would be more important to the two-fluid
 

 

8

concept and would reduce power costs by sbout 0.15 mill/kwhr(e); the
corresponding change for the single-fluid MSBR would decrease power costs
by about 0.07 mill/kwhr(e). If a two-week effective reactor downtime
were essigned solely to graphite replacement operations, the associated
power cost penalty would be about 0.05 mill/kwhr(e) for either concept.
Conclusions of these studies are:
1, Satisfactory MSBR performance can be obtained using graphite having
| the combined properties presently demonstrated by small-sized samples,
~ with single-fluid MSBR's appearing economically superior to two-fluld
MSBR's,

2. The development of MSBR graphite having desired properties is feasible.
(It appears that at least two vendors could produce a material satis-
factory for initial MSBR use, based on present industrial capability
for graphite production.)

3. 'The radiation behavior of small-sized graphite specimens indicates
a permissible reactor exposure in excess of 2 years for a peak MSER
power density of 100 kw/liter, based on a zero net volumetric growth
for graphite exposed to the peak pover density. The maximum stress
generated in the graphite under these conditions due to dimensional
changes and thermal effects is estimated to be a factor of 5 less
than the expected tensile strength of MSBR graphite. |

Lt, The deposition of fission products on/in graphite does not appear
to influence nuclear performance significantly. Deposition of
noble-metal fission products appears to reduce the breeding ratio
about 0.002 every 2 years of graphite exposure. Also, it appears
feasible that xenon concentrations can be kept at a 0.5% fraction

"poison level by surface sealing of the graphite with pyrolytic
carbon; further, gas stripping provides a means of keeping xenon

poisoning at a low level.

5. The design and operation of MSBR's appear sufficiently flexible
that a high nuclear performance can be maintained even though

graphite undergoes dimensional changes during reactor operation.

3. GRAPHITE BEHAVIOR
~ H. E, McCoy

Although the dimensional instability of graphite under neutron irradi-
ation has been known for some time, volume changes associated with very
high reactor exposure appear to be greater then originally anticipated.
Until recently, graphite had been exposed to’ fast neutron doses of only
gbout 1 x 10%2 neutrons/cm®. Isotropic graphite was noted to contract,
with the rate of contraction. continuously decreasing. It appeared that
the contraction would cease and that the dimensions would begin to expand
slightly as defects were produced by irradiation. However, graphite has
now been irradiated to higher doses, ‘and a very rapid rete of expansion
is noted after the initial contraction. A large and rapid physical expan-

- sion is undesirable from the viewpoint of reactor performance; also, if

the penetration of xenon into graphite vere to increase markedly as the
graphite density decreases, the nuclear performance would be adversely
affected. Based on present information, a reasonable core design life
appears to be that which permits the graphite to return to its original
volume. :
The initial graphite contraction with exposure would lead to &n
increase in the volume fraction of salt within the core region of the
reactor. Since the contraction would take place slowly with time, the
nuclear performance of the system could remain relatively constant by
adjusting the fuel concentration, and if the graphite volume fraction
did not increase mich ebove its initidl value. Expansion of the graphite
would lead to a decrease in the salt volume in the core, and eventually
lead to a decrease in nuclear performance of the system. However, if
the core graphite were replaced before it expanded much beyond its
original volume, the effect of moderator dimensional changes on nuclear
performance would be small.

Graphite for MSER’ use should nave low penetration by both gas and

© salt so/that the nuclear performance will remain kigh. Since salt nor-

mally does not vet graphite, there 1s Little tendency for the salt to
penetrate ‘the graphite unless high pressures are applied or. vetting con-
ditions arise, and these latter conditions would normally not exist.

 
 

 

10

Gaseous penetration is controlled by the diffusion coefficient of the gas
in the graphite and by gas stripping with helium bubbles. The most sig-
nificant of the fission product gases is 135Xe. Even though xenon can
be removed by stripping the salt with helium bubbles, it is desirsble
that the graphite have and retain a very low permeability so as to main-
tain xenon retention in the core at a lov level. Ways for developing
such a graphite are listed below, with method three the preferred one
at present.

- 1. Development of a monolithic graphite having the desired

characteristics.
2. Tmpregnation of the graphite with pitch.
3. Deposition of pyrolytic carbon within graphite by
decomposition of hydrocarbon. gases.

kk, Deposition of metal on the graphite surface. -

An important consideration is the sbility of the MSBR graphite to
retain low values of the gaseous diffusion coefficient throughout the
reactor exposure period.

As indicated above, the proposed use of graphite in molten-salt
breeder reactors poses some rather stringent requirements upon this mate-
rial. Tt must have excellent chemical purity in order to have the desired
nuclear properties. It should be impermeable to molten salts and have a
diffusion coefficient (to gaseous fission products) of about 10” £t2/nr.
Also, the graphite must have reasonable dimensional stability to fast
neutron doses in the range of 1022 to 102° neutrons/cm® (E > 50 kev).

In the next sections a critical assessment is made ‘of the status of
graphite development for molten-salt breeder reactors.

3.1 Irradiation Behavior of Graphite
C. R. Kennedy

Graphite undergoes displacement demage under neutron irradiation,

resulting in anisotropic crystallite growth rates. The crystal expands

in the c-axis direction end experiences an a-axis contraction. Irradi-
ation studies® on isotropic large-crystallite pyrographite have shown

that the overall growth rates correspond to a very small volumetric
expansion. The volume expansion is attributed to minor adjustments in
lattice parameters to accommodate the vacancy and interstitial atom con-
centrations. However, the linear growth rates in highly orientated pyro-
graphite are extremely large and represent the growth rates of individual

crystallites of the filler coke particles in reactor-grade graphite.

Also, the irradiation behavior of graphite is dependent upon its fabri-
cation history.

A comparison of graphite irradiation behavior obtained at different
laboratories is made difficult by the various exposure scales used by
the different experimenters. Perry* hag examined this problem and con-
cluded that an exposure scale based upon neutrons with energies greater
than 50 kev can be used to compare results obtained from widely different |
reactors. This exposure scale will be used in our enalysis of the

| existing data.

Neutron irradiation causes various grades of graphite to undergo an
initial decrease in volume rather than the expansion observed in pyro-
graphite having an equivalent crystallite size. -Irradistion resultsS’®
are glven in Figs. 3.1 and 3.2 for an isotropic and an anisotropic grade
(AGOT), respectively. The actual changes in linear dimensions are, of
course, different from grade to grade, and depend largely on the degree
of anisotropy present in the graphite. The initial decrease in volume
is attributed to the closing of voids generated by thermal strains
during cooling in the fabrication process. The closing of the void volume
is accompanied by c-axis growth and a-axis shrinkage. The orientation of
the crack or void structure, due to the thermal strain origin, allows the
c-axis growth to be accommodated internally; the changes in crystallite
dimensions do not contribute to the overall changes in macroscopic

dimensions wntil the cracks are closed.

The original graphite void volume also affords a degree of accommo-
dation of the internal shearing strains that would otherwise be produced
by the differential growth rates of graphitized coke particles. However,
once the cracks are closed, this accommodation no longer exists, and the
macroscopic dimensional changes should then reflect the c-axis growth.

If the shear strains are accommodated as in isotropic pyrolytic

carbon,’ large internal shear strains resulting from more than 160%

differential growth of the crystallites can be accommodated by plastic
deformation without internal fracturing of the graphite and with very
small gross volumetric -expansions. However, as shown in Figs. 3.1 and
3.2, experimental results show that, for samples tested, the graphite
generally contracts to a minimum volume and then expands very rapidly.
The ‘very rapid rate of volume expansion indicates that the expansion in
all directions 15 dominated by c-axis growth. This is difficult to
explain unless continuity in the direction of the a-axis has been lost,
since there are two a-axes in the crystal and only one c-axis. It, there-
fore, appears that continuity has been lost between the ad jecent grains
and -that overall the a-axis contraction cannot restrain the c-axis growth.

The above explanation for the changes taking place inside the
graphite implies that the internal straining due to differential growth
is accommodated primarily by cracking and not by deformation. To date,
the highly exposed graphites have been subjected to casual, low-magnifi-
cation surface examinations. These. reveal, as expected, that the general
region of fallure has been in the interparticle or binder region. Only
one isolated case has been found of a crack running across the layer
planes of a particle. These results indicate that the binder region
has little capacity to accommodate the shear strain and as & result it
fractures,

If the graphite-volume decrease (during irradiation) is & result of
closing the volds generated by thermal strains (introduced during febri-
‘cation), the minimum decrease in volume and the exposure required to

achieve the minimum volume should be temperature dependent; i.e., there
would be partial closure of the void volume simply by the thermal expansion
accompanying heating. Therefore, increasing the irradiation temperature
should decrease the irradiation growth required to close the cracks and
achieve the minimum volume. Thus, unless the irradiation growth rates in
the c-axis and e-axes vary appreciably with temperature, the time to con-
tract and then to expand to a specified volume should decrease with in-
creasing temperature. This behavior has been observed as shown on Figs.
3.3, 3.4, and 3.5 using the results of Henson et al.” and Helm.® Figure
3.3 gives the maximum volume contraction as a function of temperature.

total exposure required to achieve maximum graphite volume contraction

and that required for the graphite to expand back to its original volume.

It should be recognized that these data were obtained from GETR and
DFR experiments; the neutron energy spectra associated with these reactors
‘differ significantly, and the fast flux differs by almost an order of
magnitude. The data, however, correlate well and if a dose-rate effect
exists, it appears to be very small over the temperature range studied.

In estimating the useful lifetime of the graphite for the MSHR, the
present information on tested grades has been used. Some speculation is
required since there is little information concerning the effects of
volume expansion on pore spectrum, gas-penetration characteristics, end
strength of the graphite. It appears probable that contraction followed
by expansion back to the initial graphite volume does not create a
structure less sound than the original unirradiated material. On this
basis, the useful life of the graphite would correspond to the exposure
required for the graphite to return to its original volume. Therefore,
based upon grades of graphite that have been tested end the results
shown in Fig. 3.5, the lifetime expectancy of graphite at T00°C would
be about 3 x 1022 neutrons/cm?® (E > 50 kev).

The graphite temperature in an MSBR varies with core design and
pover density and also with spatial position within the reactor. For
an MSBR operating at an average power density of 80 kw/liter, peak .
graphite temperatures would be in excess of 750°C. However, peak tempera-
ture is probably not the proper criterion; rather, the volume-averaged
graphite temperature in the vicinity of the highest fast neutron flux
would be more appropriate. The peak volume-averaged temperature would
tend to decrease with increasing number of fuel flow channels, with de-
creasing power density, and upon changing from two-fluid to single-fluid
type MSBR's. A value of T00°C is representative of the effective volume-
averaged temperature to be used in estimating permissible graphite
exposure for MSBR's operating at an average core power density of sbout
40 kw/liter; a more detailed analysis of graphite growth, temperature,
and associated stresses is given in Section 3.2 vhich verifies the above.

The effect of graphite size on dimensional stability during reactor

exposure has been reported by Nightingale and Woodruff .® Large blocks

have shown a transverse shrinkege rate of up to twice that of subsize
specimens. Although the rationale for such behavior is very vague, this
"size effect" has occurred. Unpublished dete® from BNWL indicate that,
although the volumetric contraction in the transverse direction with large-
size graphite specimens is possibly greater by about 1% than that obtained
with small-size samples, the exposure required to obtain minimum volume
and reversal in volume growth has not been reduced. Further, published
deta from BWL® of a very preliminary nature indicate that extruded pipe
specimens of approximately 3 in. OD and 2 in. ID with about 0.2 in.
machined from each surface had the same growth rate as small-size speci-
mens. The "size effect" would, at the most, only require an allowance
for this increase in transverse shrinkage in the design. The above would
neither increase nor decrease the lifetime expectancy of the graphite.

3.2 Stresses Generated in Graphite During Irradiation

W. P. Eatherly and C. R. Kennedy

The above discussions concerned the limitations on graphite lifetime
due to 1rradiation-induced dimensional changes, for the case of graphite
in a stress-free condition. In actual fact, temperature and flux gradients
in the core will tend to produce differential distortions within the
graphite, thus generating internal stresses. In examining these effects,
a single-fluid reactor will be considered in which the core is constructed
of cylindrical prisms of graphite (1.e., tubes) running axially through
the core. The stresses will arise from two distinct causes. Within each
prism there will be symmetric neutron flux end temperature gradients due

‘to flux distributions in a reactor "cell." In addition, ecross the prisms

there will be superimposed asymmetric gradients due to the gross radial
flux and temperature distributions within the core. The symmetric gradi-
ents will be maximum in the central region of the core vhere the power
density is high; the asymetric gradients will be maximum in the outer
regions of the core where the "blanket" region causes a rapid decrease in

power density with increasing core radius. The symmetric gradients will

be considered first.

In examining stresses it is necessary to relate the dimensional be-
havior of the graphite to the three ‘independent varisbles of temperature,
flux, end time. In the temperature range of interest (550 to 750°C), the
dimensional behavior for isotropic graphite is approximated by

This function is plotted in Fig. 3.6 as a function of fluence with
temperature as a parameter; as shown, 24/2 £ is a strong function of the
irradiation temperature. .

The maximum internal symmetric flux gradients occur in the central
region of the core; at this position the salt-to-graphite volume ratio
will be about 20%. An appropriate graphite ‘cylinder size is one having
an internal radius, a, of 1.5 cm and an external radius, b, ‘of 5 cm; it
is assumed that surface temperatures will be the seme on both surfaces.
The fuel salt enters the reactor at a temperature of 550°C and exits at
700°C. Also, the neutron flux causing fissions, 9, 1s considered to

The internal heating within the graphite will be due to energy depo-~ .
sition by both prompt and delayed y rays. For the assumed pegk power
density of 100 kw/liter, this energy deposition amounts to about 8 w/cc ’

prompt and 2 w/ce delayed. Thus, the internal energy generation rate,
4g, is approximately given by

a=8sin224 2vwlce .

Tr

This expression combined with the graphite geometry and dimension gives
Q, the heat transfer rate per unit length of graphite between the graph-
ite and the fuel salt. Since the radial temperature gradients are much
greater than the axial gradients, all the energy generated in the graph-
ite is considered to flow in the radial direction.

The heat genération in the flowing fuel salt will be nearly pro-
portional to the flux 0, and thus the temperature in the flowing salt
will have a cosine dependence on z. Further, the temperature drop, AT,
from the flowing salt to the graphite—salt interface can be calculated

This yields the surface temperature of the graphite. The internal graph-
ite temperatures follow immediately from the equations of heat flow in a
hollow cylinder with a uniformly distributed heat source. The calculated
salt, surface, and central graphite temperatures along the central axis
of the core are shown in Fig. 3.7.

‘Based on the above, the flux and temperature conditions in the graph-
ite tube are specified as a function of z and r, and thus, through Eq.
(3.1), so is the local radiation-induced distortion. Thus, the induced
stresses can be obtained by solving the stress-strain equations. Before
doing this, it is helpful to review briefly the creep behavior of a uni-
axially loaded graphite bar under irradiation, and define terms used to
describe this behavior. Figure 3.8 illustrates the type of relation be-
tween strain and fluence for a constant applied stress, 0. The material
responds immediately in an elastic mode,* then proceeds to undergo a satu-
‘rating primary creep superimposed on. a linear secondary creep. The primary
creep is essentially = constant volume creep and appears to be reversible.
Since it saturates at fluences small compared to those of interest here,
it is valid to treat it as a non-time-dependent elastic strain. With this

In its bowed condition the tube is essentially in a stress-free condition.
If it 1s constrained from bowing by adjacent tubes, then these adjacent
tubes must produce distributed external stresses Just sufficient to
straighten out the bowed tube. Thus, the problem reduces to a beam under
distributed external loading but undergoing creep, with the maximum
stresses being produced in the extreme radial fibers. Let ay be the

3.3 Penetration of Graphite by Gases and Salts

W. H. Cook

3.3.1 Penetration by Gases

Numerous gaseous fission products will be produced in molten-salt
breeder reactors,! the worst being °5Xe from the viewpoint of neutron
absorptions, Ideally, the graphite should be completely impermeable to
135ye, However, reasonably low values of the xenon fraction poisoning
(about 0.5%) can be obtained by stripping the xenon with helium bubbles
and/or by using a graphite in which the diffusion rate of xenon is very
low.

Two parameters are very important in controlling the quantity of
xenon residing in the graphite at a given time. The first is the void
volume, since the amount of gas present is controlled by the space in
which it can be accommodated. This void volume can be made low by |
multiple impregnations of the graphite during processing. The second
factor is the rate at which xenon can diffuse into the graphite, which
is controlled by the xenon concentration gradient and the properties
of the graphite. The accessible void volume is measured by use of
helium or kerosene, and the diffusion coefficient is obtained from
permeability measurements with helium. Examination of gas transport
phenomena reveals that in graphite having very low penetration character-
istics, the permeability and diffusion coefficients* are numerically
equal. This condition exists when the mean free path of the gaseous
molecules is greater than the diameter of the pores in the graphite,
corresponding to the Knudsen flow conditions. The value of the diffusion

magnitude. Also, the Knudsen diffusion coefficient for xenon at 650°C
expressed in ft 2/nr is approximately equal mumericelly ! to that for helium
at 25°C expressed in cm®/sec.

under a differential pressure. The term B,p,/ represents the viscous
coefficient and is a function of the average pressure and the gas vis-
cosity (laminar flow); the second term is the Knudsen diffusion coeffi-

cient, 18214

Having determined Dye for a given set of experimental conditions,
extrapolation to other conditions of interest can be made since the
Knudsen flow coefficient, Ko» is a function only of the porous medium.
Thus, through permeability measurements of helium in graphite, the
diffusion coefficient of xenon in graphite can be calculated.

Methods for reducing void volumes and diffusion coefficients for
gases in graphite, as well as values associated with these parameters,

are given in subsequent sections of this chapter.

3.3.2 Penetration by Salts

The efforts being made to obtain graphite with a low gas permeability
should yield a materiel with high resistance to penetration by salts.
The resistance to salt penetration into the graphite pores results from
the relatively high surface tensions of the molten salts such that they
do not wet graphite. The molten fluoride salts at 700°C have surface
tensions &bout 230 dynes/cm and a contact angle with graphitel® of
approximately 150°. It is inherent that massive polycrystalline graphite
will have some accessible porosity, but the pore entrance diameters can
be held reasonebly small, < 1 p. Therefore, if there is no pressure
differential between the helium-filled pores and the salts, the salts
should not intrude into the accessible pores since they obey the Washburn

relation® given by

Several observations support the applicability of this equation to
fluoride salt systems. Calculations indicate that a pressure difference
of approximately 300 psia would be required to start the intrusion of
fuel salt into the larger pore entrances (approximately 0.4 p) of the
grade CGB graphite used in the MSRE. In out-of-pile standard salt-
screening tests in which a 165-psia pressure differential was epplied to
a salt-CGB graphite system, the salt was limited to small penetrations
of the surface and to cracks which intersected exterior surfaces. In
the latter, the salt was confined to the crack and did not penetrate the
matrix.” In-pile tests1® and the experience to date with the MSRE®"~ 21
suggest that radiation does not alter the nonwetting characteristics of
the fuel salt to the graphite. Finally, the effects of compositional
differences in the fuel and blanket fluoride salts, of metal fission-
product deposition on the graphite, of fission product fluorides or
minor contamination of the salt do not appear to make important changes
in the nonwetting characteristic.22

The pressure difference appears to be the controlling factor for
salt penetration as long as the wetting characteristics ere not altered.
The maximum anticipated operating pressure of the fuel salt in the MSER
will be ebout 50 psig. The helium cover-gas pressure prior to filling
the reactor with fuel will be approximately 20 psisa. Consequently, the
pressure will not be able to force salt into graphite pores having
openings of 1 pu. Steps being taken to reduce the gas permesbility will
probebly reduce the entrance diemeters of the accessible pores to con-
siderably less than 1 u.

There are no date at this time which suggest that the salt will
ever wet the graphite. However, if for some reeson wetting occurred,
some data suggest thet penetration by a semiwetting or wetting liquid
would be limited by frictional effects and/or by the pore structure
of the graphite involved. This should be particularly true for the type
of graphite sought for MSBR's because it should have very small pore
entrances, The friction concept has been referred to by Eatherly.2
This effect was illustrated by tests with molten sulfur, which wets
graphite. The sulfur penetrated only to an average depth of approxi-
mately 0.25 in. in a previously evacuated block of grade CGB graphite.2?*

3.3.3 Pore Volume Sealing Techniques

A graphite which prevents salt and fission products from entering
is desired for improved neutron economy, as indicated previously.
Several techniques show promise for producing such a graphite. These
involve treatment of base-stock graphite by (1) impregnating with carbon-
aceous liquids that are carbonized and graphitized, (2) impregnating
with salts, (3) sealing with pyrolytic carbon or graphite, and (4) seal-
ing with a chemical-vapor-deposited metal. All should be of some value
in limiting gaseous end liquid transport into the graphite; the latter
two appear the most promising for MSER application.

The base stock for all processes should have a narrow range of pore
entrance diemeters < 1 p. This pore structure is finer than that found
in most high-density grades of graphite. However, with proper grain
sizing, this type of base stock has already been fabricated by graphite

manufacturers.

Liguid Impregnations

Hydrocarbons. The classical approach for reducing the porosity
and increasing the density of graphite has been to impregnate the base
stock with coal tar pitches that are subsequently carbonized and grephi-
tized.2® Recent work has used a variety of carbonaceous materials such
as thermosetting resins. During the pyrolysis of the impregnants, a
variety of gases, primarily hydrocarbons, are driven off. The pore spaces
created by these escaping gases will also be available to fission gases.
Also, these impregnants usually decrease appreciably in volume during
pyrolysis and slightly during carbonizetion; so, the finel volume of the
impregnant does not completely fill or block voids. Since a graphite is
desired in which the gas flow is controlled by diffusion (Knudsen flow),
the hydrocarbon gases formed during pyrolysis must escape by the same
mechanism. Consequently, the carbonization cycle has to be long and
carefully controlled. Spalling and cracking are common fabrication
problems of such high-quality graphite. For example, the grade CGB
grephite with a nominal permeability of 3 x 1074 em®/sec developed tight
cracks during its final stages of fabrication because of the quality of
the sealing. Graham and Price reported only a 38.3% yield of fuel element
graphite for the flrst charge of the Dragon reactor, 26 even though a fine
carbon black, an amorphous carbon, was used in the fabrication of their
base stock to give them a starting fine-pore structure. We are not con-
gidering the use of amorphous carbon in the graphite for MSBR'e until we
evaluate its dimensional stability under irradiation.

Liquid impregnation has been used to produce pieces of graphite
having very low permesbilities;26727 permeability values reported have
been < 10°¢ em®/sec.

At this time, a permeability of about 10 > cm®/sec appears to be
readily obtaineble in fine-grained, high-density anisotropic or isotropic
graphite. As indicated above, decreasing this permesbility by hydrocarbon
impregnation techniques becomes increasingly difficult as permeability is
decreased. The low permeabilities given above were for anisotropic grades
of graphite, but a large part of the associated technology should be use-
ful for the fabrication of low-permesbility isotropic graphite. It would
be desirable to produce a structure which is uniform throughout; however,
it may be satisfactory to have a shallow surface impregnation plus
graphitizing treatment.

Metals and Salts. Previously we emphasized the need for a premium
grade of base stock. If metals or salts are used as impregnants, however,
the restrictions on the fine-pore-diameter spectrum of the base stock
could be relaxed. However, the impregnation of the pore volume with metals
is not being seriously considered for the MSBR because it might introduce
intolerable quantities of nuclear poisons. At the same time, impregnating
graphite with salts such as LiF, CaFp, or LigBeFs is & possibility. Such
salts would not constitute intolerable nuclear poisons. The first two
would be solids, and the third would bé liquid at the reactor operating
temperatures. Although not measured, it is probsble thet the diffusion
rate of urenium, other fuel-salt and bleanket-8alt components, and fission
products into the impregnant would be quite low.28

A small of work was done some years ago in which CeFz was used as an
impregnent. However, attendant experimental problems are difficult,
since the fluoride salts are hygroscople, and a graphite impregnated with

such salts would have to be protected from the atmosphere until installed
in the core and the core sealed.

Finally, there is the possibility of using counter diffusion of gases--
a concepted worked on for some time by the British. A counter flow of
helium cover gas from the graphite to the salt could help block diffusion
of 135Xe and other gases into graphite. This method would also supply
helium buhbles to the core region to help remove *35Xe from the fuel salt.
However, such &n approach requires speclal core designs and gas flow

through the graphite, and appears less desirable than the development of

improved graphite.

3.3. 4 Surface Coatings and Seals

In addition to using liquid hydrocarbon {mpregnants for obtaining
improved graphites, a promising method involves sealing the graphite
surface by deposition of pyrolytic carbon (or graphite) or ‘pure metals.

" Such & sealing method has been applied successfully to graphite to give

an improved oxidation resistance. Much of this work has been associated
with rockets and missile applications. The approach has been to apply =
coating on a massive substrate of porous graphite. Similar work has been
done on nuclear reactor _graphite, to decrease helium rermeability from |
3.7 x 10"2 to less than 10~7 cm®/sec.2® Coatings of carbides, oxides,
silicldes, pure metals, pyrocarbon, and pyrogrephite have been investi-
gated. Not all were applied by the pyrolytic technique. The usual
problems=° vere cracking of the coating or loss of the coatings because
of differences in rates of thermal expansion. In some instances the

graphite substrate was manufactured specifically to match the thermal

expansion of a particular coating.
A low-permeability pyrocarbon-graphite material has been reported.
by Bochirol®l in which graphite was sealed with pyrolytic carbon formed

from methene or a sulfur-free naturel gas at 900°C. Such material, even
if heat treated to 3000°C, may not be stable enough to radiation damage
for MSBR application because the crystallites are small, approximately
100 A. However, it does suggest that pyrocarbon cen be deposited into
graphite substrate to a significant depth. The gross permesbilities
approached 10~7 cm®/sec as deposited, but were increased to 10° cm®/sec
by 8 graphitizing heat treatment. Since the reduction in permeability of
the sample was obtained by sealing the surface, the gas diffusion coeffi-
cient associated with the surface seal was much lower than the gross
permeability coefficient, by the ratio of seal depth to sample thickness.
As indicated ebove, coatings or surface sealing can be employed.
Surface sealing, which injects the sealant a short distance into the pore
structure of the graphite, appears preferable to minimize the effects of
radiation damage on the seal effectiveness. This type of sealant would
be more adherent than a simple surface layer. BN
The surface sealant approach using pyrolytic carbon is in early
stages of study at ORNL.32 Pyrolytic carbon is deposited from propylene,
CsHg, on graphite specimens in fluidized beds at approximately 1100°C.
In one test the helium permeability of a graphite having two peaks in the
pore spectrum was decreased from approximately 1072 to about 2 x 1077
cm®/sec. This was the average permeability obtained by considering the
graphite to be homogeneous; the permeability of the material near the
surface was estimated to be about 10° cm®/sec. The carbon penetrated

the pores as well as forming a surface layer approximately 15 u thick.

‘The low permegbility was maintained when the sample was heated to 3000°C

and cooled to room temperature. Additional work on surface sealing is in
progress using an isotropic graphite that has a narrow range of pore
sizes with entrance diemeters near 1 pu. Specimens of this material have
been sealed and irradiated to high reactor exposures in the High Flux
Isotope Reactor (&bout 1022 nvt), but the results have not yet been
evaluated.

The metallic surface sealing studies carried out at ORNL involve
use of molybdenum or niobium.32 The metal is deposited on a heated graph-
ite substrate by reducing the metal halide with hydrogen. Initial re-
sulte have shown that a molybdenum coating approximately 0.05-mil thick
decreased the permeability ‘of a porous, molded graphite semple from
approximately 10 to 1076 cn?/sec ; the permeability of the coating
itself would be much lower. The coating maintained its integrity during
thermal cycling, and more extensive testing 1s planned. :

3.4 Near-Term Industrial Production Capability

W. P. Eatherly

Discussions have been held with several vendors on the possibility
of producing from Gilso-carbon flour an isotropic graphite meeting the

- initial MSER requirements end having the radiation-behavior character-

istics of the British graphite. Two ‘vendors have made Gilso-base material
into large blocks having the above radiation characteristics; 5 the blocks,

‘however, have a coarse-grained structure which would not meet the perme-

ability requirements of the MSER. Both vendors also have active programs
aimed at .producing fine-grained materials , and one vendor has made a
production run on tubing approximately 1 in. OD.

Production equipment was exhibited by one vendor which is capable
of producing tubing up to 15 ft in length, with processing parameters
appropriate to Gilso-carbon flours, flaw-free structure ’ and low perme-

ability. Several vendors have expressed their confidence in being sble

to produce the required material on a firm price basis in from 18 to 2h

months. .

It appears that at least two vendors would be able to > produce a
material vhich would be useable in an MSER. Producing this material re-
quires little extension of existing technology, and the uncertainties lay
mostly in the region of processing yields and cycle times rather than in
basic product formlation or process.

Thus, an isotropic graphite capable of operating up to an MSBR
dose of about 3 x 1022 neutrons/em® (E > 50 kev) appears available with
moderate extensions of existing technology. The base material would
probably have a helium permeability of sbout 10° cm®/sec, and it appears
that pyrolytic carbon can be used to seal the surface. Present work
indicates that the surface of graphite can be sealed to obtain a surface
permeability of about 10™° cm®/sec; the techniques presently being used
can be scaled up to seal MSBR-size tubes. However, additional work may
be required in order to develop a seal which is resistant to radiation
damage.

4. FISSION PRODUCT BEHAVIOR IN MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR SYSTEMS
oo © 8. 8. Kirslis

The removal of fission products from the reactor core is required in
MSBR systems in order to attain good fuel utilization performance. The
ability to continuously remove such nuclides is dependent upon their be-
havior in reactor environments and, in particular, upon the retention
characteristics of graphite for fission products. In this chapter the
behavior of important fission products in molten-salt~graphite-metal
systems is considered; fission gases such as 1®5Xe, however, are treated
‘more specifically in Chapter 5.

In order to use unclad graphite in direct contact with fissioning
molten fluorides, some rather stringent chemical compatibility require-
ments must be met. First, there must be no destructive chemical reaction
between graphite and the fuel salt with its contained fission products.
Second, the fuel must not wet the graphite surface since this would lead
to permeation of the graphite pores by bulk fuel end also fission products.
Third, individual fission products of appreciable cross section must not
leave the salt phase and accumlate on the graphite surface or penetrate
into the graphite interior to a degree which significantly affects the
neutron economy of a breeder reactor. This chapter summarizes recent

experimental information on fission product behavior in MSR systems.

4,1 1In-Pile Capsule Tests

 

In-pile capsule tests carried out early in the MSRE program showed
that there was no significant chemical damage to graphite in contact with
fissioning molten salt under reactor operating conditions. There were
compatibility problems only when the molten fuel was allowed to freeze
and cool below 100°C during the course of the experimental measurements.
Under these conditions the solid fuel was radiolyzed by the fission
product radiations, yielding elemental fluorine and reduced species in
the salt. A final in-pile capsule test (ORNL-MTR-47-6) showed no graphite

damage and no uranium deposition when the fuel was not allowed to freeze.

Cover-gas samples taken during this test showed no Fg or CFs generation

from the irradiated capsules. There was also no permeation of fuel salt
into the graphite in the final test nor even in the previous tests where
some fuel radiolysis occurred. ar

No detailed observations on fission product behavior were made in

‘these early tests. However, there were indications that 1°3Ru and 196Ru

deposited on the submerged metal and graphite surfaces and some evidence
that *°1I and 2°Te deposited on the capsule walls above the liquid level

and on the walls of the cover-gas lines.

k,2 Exposure Tests in the MSRE Core

More detailed studies of the interaction of graphite with fissioning
molten salt were carried out in the MSRE reactor environment. A 5-ft-long
test assembly of graphite and Hastelloy N specimens, shown in Fig. b.1,
was exposed to circulating fuel salt in a central position of the reactor
core for T7800 Mwhr of reactor operation. A second similar assembly was
exposed subsequently for 24,000 Mwhr of reactor operation. These assemblies
were removed from the reactor, dismantled in a hot cell, and the specimens
subjected to a series of examinations and analyses.

Three rectangular graphite bars were selected from each assembly for
examination, these bars being taken from the top, middle, and bottom parts
of the core. Adjacent Hastelloy N specimens were cut from the perforated
metal basket surrounding each specimen assembly. Visually, the graphite
specimens appeared undamaged except for occasional bruises incurred

during the dismantling. Metallographic examination showed no radiation

‘or chemical demage to the graphite structure and no evidence of surface

films. X-yradiogrephy of. thin transverse slices showed occasional salt
penetration into previously existing cracks which extended into the speci-
men surface. This penetration probebly accounted for the slight gein in
weight (~13 mg out of about 30 g). Similer penetration was observed in
the control specimens vhich were exposed to molten salt in the &bsence

of radistion. No new cracks were caused by the exposure to radiestion. -

A suggestion of a very thin layer of denser materiel on the graphite
surface exposed to salt was visible In the x-radiographs of the irradi-
ated and the control specimens. X-ray diffraction analyses of the graphite
surface exposed to fuel showed a normal graphite pattern, with a very
slightly expanded lattice spacing. A few very weak foreign lines, probably
due to fuel salt, vere observed. Autoradiography of the graphite specimens
showed a high concentration of activity within 10 mils of the surface,

with diffuse irregular penetrations to the center of the specimens (the
resolution of these measurements was sbout 10 mils). An electron probe
examination of the graphite specimens (carried out et Argonne Nationsl
Laboratory) detected no impurities in the graphite at or near the surface
exposed to fuel, with detection limits of 0.0k wt 4 for fission products
and 0.02 wt % for uranium. These series of observations, based on samples
having T900- and 2L,000-Mwhr reactor exposures, indicated satisfactory
compatibility of graphite with fissioning molten salt relative to damage
by chemical reaction and to permeation of bulk fuel into graphite.

The three rectangular graphite bers from each of the two MSRE runs
vere also used to study fission product deposition on graphite in more
detail. Thin layers of graphite, 1 to 10 mile thick, were milled from
the flat surfaces of the bars to a final depth of gbout 50 mils. These

samples were dissolved and analyzed rediochemicelly. The predominant

activities found deposited on and in the graphite were the isotopes of

- molybdenum, tellurium, ruthenium, end niobium. These elements may be

classed as noble metals since thelr fluorides are relatively unstable.
Their deposition on graphite is of practical concern since several -iso-
topes in this class (in particular, ®SMo, ®7Mo, .®9Tc, and 91Ru) have
relatively high neutron cross sections; if the total fission yields of
these fission products were retained in the graphite core, the long-term
active isotope of the same element or that of a radioactive noble-metal

 

46

neutron economy of an MSER would be adversely affected. It is difficult
to analyze directly for these stable or long-lived species; it was assumed
that their deposition behavior was indicated either by that of a radio-
presursor of apprecisble half-life. ‘
“Analyses of the milled graphite samples showed that over 9% of the
deposited noble-metal activities were concentrated within 5 mils of the
graphite surfaces. Conversely, the daughters of the kryptons and xenons
were more uniformly distributed throughout the graphite specimens with
shorter lived rare gases having. steeper concentration gradients through
the graphite (as expected). Elements with stable fluorides and no gaseous

precursors (Zr, rare earths) showed low surface concentrations and were

gbsent from the interior ‘of the graphite.

‘Relatively heavy deposits of noble-metal fission products were ob-
served on the Hastelloy N specimens adjacent to the graphite samples.
The deposits of other fission products on Hastelloy N were relatively
light. The deposition of noble metal fission products on Hastelloy N

‘and graphite can be quantitatively described .in terms of the fraction of

the total fission products produced during reactor operation which was
deposited. It was assumed that deposition on the specimens is repre-
sentative of deposition on all the reactor graphite end Hastelloy N
surfaces in the MSRE system. On this basis, 14% of the “Mo, 13% of

the 1327e, 9b of the 103gy, and 45% of the Shp produced during the first
T7800 Mwhr of MSRE operation deposited on the graphite core. During the
same period, 4TH of the ®Mo, nearly all the 1°2Te, and 23% of the 1°3Ru
produced deposited on the metal surfaces.

The deposition of fission products on graphite and metal after about
32,000 Mvhr of MSRE operation is shown in Teble 4.1 as percentages of the
total of each species generated in the reactor system. The results are
agaln based on the assumption that deposition on specimens is represen-
tative of all surface deposits. The relative activities of Mo, 1%2Te,
and 1°3Ru found on the graphite and metal specimens were bout the same
as those found after the first T7800 Mwhr; however, the relative activity
of °°Nb was distinctly higher after the second exposure. Also, after
the 2k,000-Mwhr exposure, the ratio of ®SNb deposited per emf on metal

was 8 for ®°Mo, 1k for 1321¢, and 4 for 193%Ru--esch somevhat higher than
for the 7800-Mwhr exposure. Tt had been expected that the ratio would
fall toward unity as both graphite and metal became coated with noble
metals, but this apparently did not occur. In the present MSBR designs
the ratio of metal surface to graphite surface is about 1.5 to 1, rather
than 1 to 2 as in the MSRE. Thus, based on these test results, only a
small percentage of the noble metal fission products should deposit on
the graphite in the MSBR core.

addition, metal and graphite specimens were exposed to the fuel salt and
to the cover gas. .

Early fuel-salt samples, taken in open copper ladles, were found to
be highly contaminated with noble-metal activities because the open
sampling ladles passed through the cover-gas region. Contamination was
avoided in later fuel samples by sampling into an evacuated capsule pro-
vided with & freeze valve which melted when the capsule was lowered into
the molten salt. The later results showed that less then 1% of the noble-
metel nuclides produced remain in the fuel-salt phase; species with stable
fluorides (zr, elkaline earths, rare certhe), however, remained predomi-
nately in the fuel.

It was further found that high concentrations of noble-metel fission
products existed in the MSRE cover-ges volume. The metal specimens ex-
posed to the cover gas picked up activities associated with noble metals
several times that contained in & gram of fuel salt. The ‘fundamentals of
why these materials transfer snd remain in the gas phase are not fully
understood; however, inert gas flow may prove to be an effective way to
remove significant fractions of fission products, and this action may
account for the relative decrease in fission product deposition on graph-
ite with time, which is discussed below.

In another test, sets of graphite and Hastelloy specimens in the pump
bowl were exposed to the gas phase and to the fuel phase for 8 hr during
full power reactor operation. Within a factor of ten, the same amount of

each nuclide deposited on all the specimens independent of location.
The deposition of noble metals on Hastelloy N in this test appeared to

proceed at the same constant rate in the 8-hr run as in the 24,000-Mwhr
(3340-hr) exposure in the MSRE core. However, the average deposition
rates of noble metals on graphite were sbout a factor of ten lower in the
3340-hr exposure then in the 8-hr test, except for ®“Nb, where the factor
vas ebout 1.5. This could indicate that the deposition rate of noble .
metals (except 5Nb) on graphite decreases with exposure time, which is
an advantage from the viewpoint of neutron economy. However, results to
date should be treated &s preliminary, and further investigations are
needed. Samples of the gas from the MSRE pump bowl indicated that the
helium cover gas contained about 5 ppm by mole of °°Mo (i.e., 5 moles

 
 

 

 

 

50

of °°Mo per 10° moles of helium) and 1-2 ppm each of *32re, 10%Ry, 1%Ry,
and ®°Nb. If these concentrations are present in the gas leaving the
pump bowl and are multiplied by the flow of helium through the pump bowl
(6000 liters/day), the losses of ®°Mo and *®2re to the cover gas are those
given in Table 4.1. As shown, these calculated losses are appreciable
fractions of the generation rate of these species in the MSRE.

L.4 Chemical State of Noble-Metal Fission Products

The results ebove indicate that the noble-metal fission products
rapidly leave the fuel-salt phase by depositing on solid surfaces and by
entering the cover-gas volume. In order to help determine the mechanisms
of volatilization, two hot-cell tests were carried out. These tests
involved passing helium or & helium-hydrogen mixture either over or
through a fuel sample from the MSRE. It was found that passage of hydro-
gen gas had no effect on fission product volatilization, which indicates
that the volatile species of the noble metals were not high-valent gaseous
fluorides. Some salt mist was swept from the sample, but the concentrations
of noble metals volatilized were one to three orders of their concentration
(if uniform) in the salt. Further, significant amounts of noble-metal
fission products were swept from the fuel sample by gas passage either
over or through the molten sample. The amounts of activity were the
same whether or not the gas contained hydrogen, indicating that these
"noble" fission products were present in metallic form. It was also
found that about 20% of the volatile noble metals passed through a filter
which held back all particles larger than 4 microns. These results suggest
that noble-metal fission products are injected into the ges phase as tiny
metal particles and form stable gaseous suspensions.

 

‘4,5 Results from ORR Loop Experiments

In addition to the study of fission product behavior in the MSRE,
fuel-salt-material tests have also been carried out with thermal con-
vection loops containing fuel salt and graphite. These loops were operated
in the Oak Ridge Research Reactor (ORR) to investigate fuel behavior at
high power densities. The first loop experiment was terminated after
generation of 1.1 x 108 fissions/cc (0.27% 235U burnup) because of

a break in a sample line. A second loop operated at an average fuel power
density of 165 w/ce until a line leading from the "core" cracked; a fuel
dose of approximately 8 x 10'® fissions/cm® was achieved. The test arrange-
ment employed in these runs is indicated in Fig. 4.3. The "core" in these
loop tests consisted of a 2-in.~-diam by 6-in.-long cylinder of graphite
(from MSRE stock). Vertical holes were bored through the graphite for
salt flow. A horizontal gas separation tank connected the top of the

core to a return line (cold leg) which, in turn, vas connected to the
bottom of the core, completing the loop. A fluid flow rate of 30 to 50
ce/min (a2 min circuit time) was maintained at a "core" temperature of
about 650°C.

The surfaces in the second ‘1oop were analyzed thoroughly to determine
the deposition of fission products. This layers were machined from the
core graphite surfaces, and these layers were analyzed to determine .the
concentration profile of the fission products within the graphite. The
results obtained for noble-metal fission products resembled very closely
those given gbove for the MSRE surveillance specimens. For reasons that
are not clear, the salt seemed to have wet the graphite and penetrated
to a distance of a few mils. This epparently was caused by the presence
of a small smount of vater vapor. No such wetting behavior has been
observed during MSRE operations.

4.6 Evaluation of Results

A principal interaction between graphite and fissioning molten salt
appears to be the partial deposition of noble metals on graphite. We
infer from the results that the percentage of noble-metal fission pro-
ducts deposited on graphite depends on the ratio of graphite surface to
metal surface, with deposition decreasing with decreasing ratio of
graphite-to-metal surface. Finally, test results indicate that signifi-

cant fractions of noble-metal fission products can be present in the gas

phase. Such behavior could provide a convenient means for their rapid
removal from MSBR systems. . Experimental studies are continuing in order
to verify the present indications.

5. NOBLE-GAS BEHAVIOR IN THE MSBR
R. J. Kedl Dunlap Scott
As pointed out previously, the graphite in the MSBR core is unclad

and in intimate contact with fuel salt. Thus, noble gases generated by
fission end any other gaseous compounds may diffuse into its porous struc

 

ture vhere they can act as heat sources and neutron poisons. Although
fission products other than xenon are involved, the greatest gain can be
made by removing *35Xe, and later discussions refer primarily to *>5Xe
poisoning.

In order to estimate neutron poisoning effects, a steady-state
analytical model was developed to estimate the transfer of noble gases
in the MSER to the graphite. The various factors considered included

decay, burnup, migration into graphite, and migration to circulating ges

bubbles. Gas generation direct from fission and generation from decay
of gas precursors were considered as source terms. The model utilizes
conventional mass transfer concepts and is used to compute nuclide con-
centrations and *35Xe poison fractions. The steady-state model for the
MSRE ig developed in reference 3k, vhile the time-dependent model is
given in references 35-38. When applied to very short-lived noble gases,

‘the model has given calculated results in agreement with MSRE velues®®

measured under reactor operating conditions.

Using & model similar to that indicated above, steady-state 1%°Xe
poisoning calculations were made for a modular two-fluid MSER [556 Mu(t)/
to show the influence of several design parameters on xenon poisoning.

The reactor design concept considered here is essentially that described
in reference 40; design parameters pertinent to Xe poisoning are given in
Table 5.1. Xenon stripping from the fuel salt is accomplished by ecircu-
lating helium bubbles with the salt; the bubbles are injected near the
pump at the inlet to the heat exchanger. Xenon-135 is considered to
migrate to the bubbles by mass transfer, with the mass transfer coefficient
controlling the rate of migration. The circulating bubbles are then
stripped from the salt by a pipeline gas separator located near the heat
exchanger outlet. |

. With regard to mass transfer of xenon to the grephite, the principal
parameters considered were the diffusion coefficient of xenon in graphite,
the mass transfer coefficients and areas assoclated with the circulating
bubbles, the time that bubbles are in contact with the salt, and the surf-
ace area of graphite exposed to salt in the core.

In Fig. 5.1 the diffusion coefficient of xenon in graphite at 1200°F
(650°C) is given in units of £t2/hr. As mentioned in Chapter 3, the _
numerical value of this coefficient in £t2/hr is about equal to the
more commonly quoted permeability of He in graphite at room temperature
with units of cm®/sec, if Knudsen flow prevails. Knudsen flow should
dominate for permesbilities < 10 * cm®/sec.

The gas bubbles circulating through the fuel system were considered
to be made up of two groups of bubbles. The first group, referred to as
the "once-through" bubbles, were injected at the bubble generator and
removed with 100% efficiency by the gas separator. The second group,
referred to as the "recirculated" bubbles, were also injected at the
bubble generator but completely bypassed the gas separator on their
first pass; it was assumed that bubbles in the second group were removed
with 100% efficiency on their second pass through the gas separator. .
The particular parameter used to indicate the amount of circulating
bubbles was the bubble surface area; for orientation purposes, note -

that 3000 £t2 of bubble surface area corresponds to an average void
fraction of 1% in the stripper region of the fuel loop with bubbles
0.020 in. in diameter, when the gas flow rate is about 40 scfm.

Figure 5.1 shows the xenon-135 poison fraction as a function of
the diffusion coefficient in graphite with other parameters having the
valueg specified. The top curve in the figure is for no circulating
bubbles. The other curves consider that about 10% of the bubbles re-

"circulate. From Fig. 5.1 it appears that the xenon poison fraction is

not a strong ‘function of the diffusion coefficient when it ranges from
107° to 107© £t2/hr. Thus, for these values of the diffusion coefficient,
the mass transfer coefficient from salt to graphite is the controlling
resistance for migration of 185Xe into the graphite, The mass transfer
coefficients from salt to graphite were computed from the Dittus-Boelter
equation. as modified by the heat-mass-transfer analogy. Since 135Xe

in the graphite is the greatest contributor to the total neutron poison
fraction, the parameters that control xenon migretion will, in tum,
control the poison fraction. For diffusion coefficients less than 10 ©
£t%/nr, the resistance to xenon diffusion in graphite starts becoming
gignificant,

Figure 5.2 shows the effect on poison fraction of the xenon mass
transfer coefficient from salt to helium bubbles. This mass transfer
coefficient is one of the least well known parameters and can be a most
significant factor. Available information indicates its value to lie
between 0.7 and 6 f£t/hr, vith a value of 2-4 ft/hr appearing reasonable
to expect. Values of about 0.7 — 0.8 £t/hr were estimated, assuming that
the bubbles behave as solid spheres having a fluld dynamic boundary
layer. Values of about 3. 5 £t/hr were estimated on the basis that the
interface of bubbles is continually being replaced by fresh fluid
(penetration theory). Both of these cases consider a bubble rising at
its terminal velocity in a stagnant fluid. There is very little infor-
mation in the literature concerning the effect of fluid turbulence on
the bubble mass transfer coefficient, but from turbulence theory it
hes been postulated that, under MSER conditions, mass trensfer coefficients
of 6 £t/hr or more could be realized. The analyses that lead to such
values are generelly optimistic in their assumptions. Figure 5.2 also

indicates that a small amount of recirculating bubbles is as effective
as & large smount of once-through bubbles in reducing xenon poisoning;
this result is due to the increased contact time for "pecirculating"”
bubbles relative to "once-through” bubbles.

Another variable that will strongly affect the xenon poison fraction
is the graphite surface area in the core. Calculations indicate that if
the graphite surface area were doubled, all other parameters remaining
constant, the poison fraction would increase by 50-=T0%.

The target poison fraction for the MSER is 0.5%. Referring to Fig.
5.2, if the bubble mass transfer coefficient were 4-6 ft/hr, gas removal
in itself appears to be a feasible method for attaining low xenon poison
fractions. If, however, the bubble mass transfer coefficient were 2-3
£t/hr or less, it appears that the target poison fraction is not attain
able under the specified conditions. Under the latter case, alternative
methods for reducing xenon poleoning are to develop graphite having a
very low gaseous diffusion coefficient (Fig. 5.1 indicates a value of
1078 £t2/hr would be satisfactory), or to coat the bulk graphite with e
thin layer of graphite having a very low permeability.

) Calculations were performed to determine the effectiveness of low-
permeability graphite coatings on xenon poisoning; Fig. 5.3 gives the
results obtained along with the parameter values used in the computations.
It. was assumed that for a coating of the indicated thickness, the specified
diffusivity and availeble void would apply to all graphite surfaces
exposed to fuel salt. The various xenon migration parameters were chosen
to yield a 335Xe poison fraction of 2.25% with no coating, so that Fig.
5.3 indicates the effect of coating parameters relative to this poison
fraction. It was assumed that the availsble void fraction in the graphite
coating decreased by one order of magnitude when the diffusion coefficient
decreased by two orders of magnitude, vhich ie a conservative assumption
relative to experimental results. As shown in Fig. 5.3, it eppears that
a coating 10 mils thick and having a diffusivity of sbout 1078 £t2/hr
and an available void of epproximately 0.3% would bring the *3SXe poison
fraction down to the target value. A diffusion coefficient of 10™° £t2/hr
would require a coating thickness of only one mil. As stated in Chapter 3,
graphite coatings having the above characteristics have been produced, and

6. INFLUENCE OF GRAPHITE BEHAVIOR ON MSBR PERFORMANCE AND DESIGN

6.1 Effect of Core Power Density on MSER Performance

A. M. Perry

Limitations on core power density due to graphite radiation damage
will influence reactor performance. The performance of an MSBR may be
Judged both in terms of the estimated power cost and also in terms of the
annual rate of net fissionsble materiel production (the annual fuel yield)
and the fuel specific power. The fuel yield depends not only on the
breeding gain (breeding ratio minus one) but also on the specific power;
that 1s, on the thermal power of the reactor per unit mass of fissionable
material chargeable to the plant (including material in the core, heat
exchangers and piping, and in the chemical processing plant). All three
factors of cost, breeding gain, and epecific power depend on the power
density in the core, but the dependence in each case 1s not unique.

That is, the extent to which each factor varies with power density depends
on other reactor parameters such as the fuel-salt and fertile-salt volume
fractions in the core, the concentration of fissioneble material in the
fuel salt, chemical processing rates, etc. An evaluation of the effect

of power density on MSER performance must therefore be based on a sedrch
for the optimum combinations of all of these veriasbles for each fixed value
of the average power density. The optimum combination is defined here in
terms of a composite figure of merit, F, such that

F=Y4+100 (C+X)* ,

vhere Y is the annual fuel yield (the annual percentage increase in fuel
inventory due to breeding), C is the sum of all elements of the power
cost which depend on the parameters being varied, and X is an adjustable
parameter whose value determines the relative sensitivity of F to Y end
to C. Thus, F increases with increasing yield and increases with de-
creasing cost, and may be made to depend almost entirely on one or the

 
 

 

 

62

other. An optimum configuration is considered here to be one which maxi-
mizes F, and by repeating the search procedure with different values of X,
curves may be generated showing the minimum cost corresponding to each
(attainable) value of the annual yield. In practice, the variation in
cost is dominated by the changes in fuel-cycle cost (raw material plus
inventory plus processing costs less production credits), and the curves
derived from our calculations have therefore been plotted as fuel-cycle
cost versus annual fuel yield. Such curves are shown in Fig. 6.1 for
average core power densities of 80, 40, 20, and 10 w/cu®. These results
apply to & two-region, two-fluid MSBER such as given in ORNL-3996. However,
preliminary results obtained for single-fluid MSBR's (considering direct
protactinium removal and fission product discard using liquid bismuth
extraction processes) indicate that comparable performance is feasible
for such systems also. For convenience in relating the annual fuel yield
to the potential power doubling time, Fig. 6.1 elso indicates the compound-
interest doubling time as a function of yield.

It is apparent from Fig. 6.1 that there is an incentive to keep the
power density as high as possible. However, if the useful 1ife of the
graphite is limited to a fixed fast neutron dose, it is desirable also to
avoid the necessity for too frequent replacement of the graphite. The
influence of graphite replacement on plant availability and on power cost
and the technical problems associated with this operation are discussed
in Section 6.3. |

 

6.2 Effect of Graphite Dimensional Changes on MSBER Performance
A. M. Perry

During reactor exposure the graphite moderator in the MSBR is expected
to experience dimensional changes approximately like those shown in Fig.
3.1, i.e., a period of shrinkage followed by increasingly rapid growth.
These dimensional changes must, of course, be allowed for in the mechani-
cal design of the core. In addition, the dimensional changes of the graph-
ite will alter the volume fractions of the three core constituents--
moderator, fuel salt, and fertile salt--and these changes, even though
accompanied by changes in uranium and thorium concentrations, may have

an adverse effect on reactor performance. There are two such effects

which especially require attention. First, changes in graphite dimensions
will cause a departure of reactor parameters from the optimum combination
required to minimize costs and maximize fuel yield. Second, the spatial
distribution of neutron productions and absorptions, which governs the
power density distribution, may be appreciably altered because of changing
graphite volume fractions, making it difficult to maintain as flat a

power distribution as would be possible with a dimensionally stable moder-~
ator. These are both rather complex questions, and the extent to which
the MSBR performance might be compromised, when averaged over & period of
years, has not been fully analyzed. However, the results obtained to date
are sufficient to indicate approximately the effects to be expected.

With fertile salt filling the spaces between the graphite "fuel
elements" (two-fluid MSBR), it is clear that a 5% reduction in graphite
cross sectional area gives rise to & large fractional increase in the |
fertile-salt volume fraction in the core--from an initial value of 0.06,
for example, to a maximum value of 0.11. Such a large volume fraction of
fertile salt is not optimum and, if uniform throughout the core, would
occasion a loss in annual fuel yield of bout 0.01 snd an increase in
fuel-cycle cost of approximately 0.1 mill/kwhr(e). The actual penalties
would not be this large, because the dimensional changes in graphite
would not occur uniformly throughout the core and because the time-averaged
volume change would be not much more than half the maximum change. The
average loss in performance, therefore, does not appear excessive if
graphite dimensional changes are no more than 5 vol %.

A potentially more serious difficulty arises in connection with the
pover density distribution in the core, which should be maintained as flat
as possible throughout the core life to increase the time interval between
graphite replacement. Calculations show that the spatial power distri-
bution is very sensitive to details of core composition, and that the
distributions of fertile and fissile materials in the core must be quite
closely controlled in relation to each other. In the presence of large,
spatially dependent changes in fertile-salt volume fraction, adjustments

in uranium and thorium concentrations in the two salt streams do not

appear sufficient to maintain both criticality end a flat power distribution.

As. a consequence of the above considerations, the original concept
of the two-fluid MSBR*© was revised so that the fertile salt stream, &s -
well as the fuel stream, flows in annular passages defined by the spacing
between concentric graphite pipes. The interstitial spaces between graph-
ite assemblies would be filled with helium. For such a design, the relative

-volume fractions of the important core constituents--the solid moderator

and the two salt streams--then remain nearly constant, while the variation
in helium volume has little influence on reactor performance. This
approach largely eliminates penalties in breeding performance in power
flattening that might otherwise result from dimensional changes in the
graphite.

Alternatively, use of & single-fluid MSBR would alleviate the in-
fluence of graphite volume changes on reactor performance. The single-fluid
reactor contains fissile and fertile materials in the same salt stream,
and so changes in graphite dimensions influence both fissile and fertile
concentrations in the reactor equally. At the same time, fissile and
fertile concentrations can be controlled independently due to use of on-

-stream processing. These conditions permit considerable flexibility

with regard to material concentrations, such that there is little change
in nuclear performance with expected graphite dimensional changes, based
on equilibrium physice — fuel-cycle calculations.

6.3 Mechanical Design Factors and Cost Considerstions

CE. 5. Bettis Bh Roy c. Robertson

~~ As shown in Chapter 3, when graphite is exposed to a high neutron
flux it first undergoes a period of shrinkage followed by swelling at an
ever-increasing rate. These effects occur both with and across the grain
structure of the graphite, although not necessarily at the same rate in

each direction, and are related to the energy of the neutrons and to the

total accumulated dose. Such dimensional changes in MSBER graphite impose
mechanical and nuclear design problems; for example, it is necessary to
prevent overstressing of the core graphite. Also, particularly, for the
tvo-fluid design, the volumetric ratios of fuel-to-graphite need to be
maintained within limits in order to obtain good nuclear and economic

performance. Thus, the useful life of the MSBR core graphite and the
associated power production costs can be significantly influenced by the
neutron-radiation-induced damage to the graphite. The influence that
graphite volume changes and a finite permissible exposure have on reactor

. design features and performance are discussed below with respect to the

two-fluid and also the single-fluid MSBR concepts. The maximum permissible
radiation exposure to MSBR .graphite, based on presently tested grades,
appears to be about 3 x 1022 neutrons/cm® (neutron energies > 50 kev).

This exposure corresponds to a final graphite volume about equal to its
initial volume (see Chapter 3). .

The two-fluid MSER core?® is designed with re-entrant type fuel
channels in order to minimize the likelihood of mechanical failure of the
graphite. Each fuel channel consists of concentric graphite pipes such
that the fuel salt flows upward through the center pipe and downward
through the annular passage; the outer pipe is closed at the top. At
the bottom of the core, the graphite pipes are brazed to Hastelloy N
nipples, with the other ends of the nipples being welded to the fuel
plena at the bottom head of the reactor vessel. Each fuel channel is
thus free to expand and contract in the axial (vertical) direction to
accommodate the dimensional changes in the graphite caused by thermal
effects and radiation-induced damage.

In order to accommodate dimensional changes in the core radial
direction, it is necessary to locate the fuel channels with sufficient
clearance to prevent interference when the graphite expands. Thus, the
top ends of all the graphite elements in the core are mechanically inter-
locked to assure that they will maintain the same position relative to
each other while at the same time not restricting the axial movement.
There are no unattached graphite elements or filler pieces in the core.
Also, in order to decrease the influence of graphite dimensional changes
on reactor performance, the two-fluld design was modified so that fertile
and fissile streams are contained in separate annular flow regions |
defined by the spacing between concentric graphite pipes. Helium was
used to fill the interstitial spaces between graphite assemblies, so
that changes in graphite volume have only a small effect on reactor
performance (see Section 6.2).

“As pointed out previously, MSBR!'s can also operate as single-fluid
reactors, with features analogous to those of the MSRE. The performance
of single-fluid MSBR's can be as good as that of the two-fluid concept
so long as the fuel stream is processed on gbout & 5-day cycle to remove
protactinium, and fission products are removed on ebout & 50-day cycle.
Recent chemical discoveries suggest that processing methods which perform
the above functions are feasible, and indicate thet such fuel processing
can be performed economically at a rapid rate. These methods utilize
liquid bismuth to selectively extract uranium, protactinium, and fission
products from fuel salt, and depend upon the relative nobilities of the

. various metals involved. Present information on relative nobilities

indicates that reductive extraction processing effecting the desired
separations is possible, and thet the equipment involved is small in

- size. Since protectinium is of intermediate nobility to thorium and

uranium, reductive extraction effectively holds Pa out of the reactor
until it decays to uranium, after which it returns to the fuel system. -
Fission products are removed by concentration in a salt stream followed
by salt discard; alternative methods are also available for fission
product removal from the fuel circuit.

In the single-fluid concept, the fuel salt flows into the bottom
of the reactor and out the top in a once-through errangement that permits
use of graphite having simple geometry. One of the present design con-

“cepts places the graphite elements on a supporting grid at the bottom of

the reactor; these elements are supported by this grid when’ there is no
salt in the reactor. Also, a metal grid is used at the top of the
reactor to maintain proper spacing and alignment of the graphite elements;
a strengthened top plenum ies used to react to the buoyant force of the
graphite when the reesctor is filled with salt and operating. The top of
the reactor vessel and/or portions of it are removable so that graphite
can be withdrawn vertically and replaced as needed. : Changes in the graph-
ite dimensions in the axial (vertical) direction ere essily accommodated
since the graphite is not restreined. The graphite elements are long
enough so that 1f axial shrinkage occurs, the graphite to fuel ratio in
the active portion of the core due to this effect remains essentially
unchanged. Changes in nuclear performance due to radisl shrinkage or

 
 

 

 

68

expansion of the graphite can be accommodated by changes in the fuel-
salt composition.

After the MSER graphite has received the maximum permissible exposure,
it must be taken out of service and replaced. In the two-fluid concept,
it appears that this would be done by replacing the entire reactor vessel
and core. In the single-fluid concept the graphite itself would be re-
placed, with the reactor vessel remaining in place throughout the life of
the plant. The time required for this replacement, the replacement cost,
and the time between replacements all influence the power cost penalty
associated with graphite replacement. Also, for a given permissible
exposure, the time between graphite replacements can be increased by
lowering the reactor power density. The influence of these factors on
reactor power costs 1s discussed below.

Lowering the core power density to increase the useful life of the
graphite requires that the reactor be made larger, thus increasing the
cost of the initial reactor as well as that for replacement equipment.

For the two-fluld MSBR, the cost of replacing a spent reactor with a

new one gppears to be a strong function of the reactor vessel size end
weight. Also, all the graphite is replaced in the operation. For the
single-fluid concept, the reactor vessel would not be replaced and only

a part of the total graphite would be removed during one replacement
operation. For both concepts, increasing the reactor vessel size leads
to higher fissile inventories and larger fuel-storage tanks, which increase
fuel and capital costs. At the same time, lowering the core power density
leads to longer graphite life and reduces the number of times the graphite
must be replaced over the useful life of the power station. As a result,
there is a minimm in the curve of power cost versus core power density
for a specified maximum permissible exposure of the graphite.

The effective cost of graphite replacement is also influenced by
plent downtime requirements associated with the replacement operation.
Since the MSBR would be fueled on & continuous or semi-continuous basis,
this concept has a potentially high load factor. Thus, if graphite re-
placement can be scheduled at times of regular turbine plant mzintenance,
total reactor downtime should be no greater than normally expected in a
base-load power plant. This appears to be the case so long as graphite

 

 
 

 

69

replacement does not occur at intervals shorter than 2 to 2.5 years.
However, in order to determine the effect on costs of losing power pro-
duction due to grephite replacement, the term "effective downtime" was
treated as a parameter, where effective downtime is the time during which
pover production is lost due solely to graphite replacement requirements.
During the "effective downtime", it was considered that power would be
bought, at 4 mills/kwhr(e) from an outside source. Values of zero, 1/2
and 1 month were used for the effective downtime. This nonproductive
time does not include plant downtime required for normal maintenance
operations, which time could also be used for replacement operations.
Labor costs associated with replacing the graphite were those for 18

men working in three shifts for two months at a cost of $10/nr, including
overhead, etc.; these costs amounted to $259,200 per replacement.

Tables 6.1 and 6.2 summarize power costs calculated for two-fluid and
single-fluld MSBER's, respectively, as a function of average core power
density, on the bases given above; effective downtime for replacing graph-
ite was considered to be 1/2 month in these cases. The results in Table
6.1 consider replacement of the entire reactor vessel and its contents
when the graphite exposure has reached a maximum value of 3 x 1022 nvt
(E > 50 kev); Table 6.2 considers a single-fluid MSER with replacement
of graphite alone. ©Since costs and revenues occur at different times,

a "levelized" cost calculation was performed, using a 6% per year
discount factor. The fuel cycle performance for the two MSER concepts
appear to be comparable, and so the same fuel cycle cost was used for
. each concept for & given average core power density.

The capital cost data shown in Tebles 6.1 and 6.2 were based on cost
estimates made for a two-fluid, 80-kw/liter, 1000-Mw(e) MSBR station.
Rather broad adjustments. vere made to these base costs in estimating
costs associated with other core power densities and with the single-
fluid concept. While there is considersble uncertainty associated with
_ the ebsolute costs given, the relative costs for the two concepts as 8
function of core pover density appear to be significant.

Cost estimates were also made on the basis that the effective plant
downtime associated with graphite replacement was elther one month or
zero. (The latter assumes that graphite replacement is performed during

normal plant maintenance operations, and this is considered to be the
reference condition. Graphite replacement can be considered equivalent
to refueling operations in other reactor types, and so there should be
no net load-factor penalty applied to MSBR's relative to other systems.)
Further, the influence of graphite permissible exposure on power costs
was determined by considering the permissible exposure to be either

6 x 1022 nvt (E > 50 kev) or 30 years (versus 3 x 1022 nvt for reference
case). In these latter studies no effective downtime was associated
vith graphite replacement. The results obtained, including those given
in Tebles 6.1 and 6.2, are summarized in Fig. 6.2.

The overall results given in Fig. 6.2 indicate that there is an eco-
nomic acvantage in developing an improved radilation-resistant graphite and
that, for a given exposure lifetime, maintenance concepts and methods that.
reduce effective graphite replacement costs and replacement downtime are
economically desirsble. In utilizing these results, it should be remem-
bered that a maximum core power density of 100 kw/liter for 2 to 2.5 years
corresponds to a zero net change in graphite volume and to an nvt (E > 50
kev) for graphite of about 3 x 1022: neutrons/cn®. For the two-fluid con:
cept, if graphite had a permissible exposure lifetime of 30 years at an .
average core power density of 80 kw/liter, the minimum power generation
cost would be about 3.03 mil1s/kvhr(e); the minimum cost would be about
3.41 mills/kwhr(e) based on a permissible graphite exposure of 3 x 1022
nvt and zero effective downtime. ‘The difference between 3.03 and 3.41
mills/kwhr(e) power cost amounts to about $80 million of revenue over.
the 30-year life of a single 1000-Mw(e) power station. If the electric
utility industry were to employ 100 such molten-salt breeder reactors at
a given time, about $265 million per year would be‘associated with re-
moving exposure limitations on the graphite. Doubling the graphite life
from 3 x 1022 to 6 x 1022 in the two-fluid reactor would reduce power
costs by about 0.2 mill/kwhr and be worth about $125 million per year for
one hundred 1000-Mw(e) MSBR's. For the single-fluid reactor, the comparable .
incentives would be about $28 million per year for doubling the graphite
life, and about $90 million per year for removing restrictions on graphite
life. Thus, even considering a reasonable discount factor, a significant o

‘effort for graphite improvement can be economically justified if such work

leads to a graphite with improved irradiation characteristics.

The power cost results given in Fig, 6.2, for which effective down-
time was treated as a parameter, show that, for the cited conditions,
lower effective downtime for graphite replacement leeds to lower power
costs. ‘Increasing the effective downtime from zero to one month in-
creased minimum power costs by 0.08 to 0.15 mill/kvhr for permissible
graphite exposures of 3 x 1022 nvt (E > 50 kev).

The ebove results indicate that exposure limitations for MSER  graph-
ite lead to less economic penalty to the single-fluid MSER than to the
two-fluid concept. Nevertheless, an improvement in graphite behavior is
desirable for both concepts. Le

6.4 The Influence on MSBR Performance of
Noble-Metal Deposition on Graphite

A. M. Perry

It has been recognized for several years that uncertainty in the
chemical behavior of certain of the fission products--notably niobium,
molybdenum, technetium, and to a lesser extent ruthenium and tellurium--
constitutes one of the principal uncertainties in estimates of the
breeding capabilities of molten-salt reactors. The Molten-Salt Reactor
Experiment is belng used to reduce or remove this uncertainty, and it
has already yielded much encouraging information of value in this regard.

The essential question is whether these fission products will remain
in the core, or whether, as we have assumed in our MSBR performance
estimates, they will be removed from the melt during fuel processing, or
perhaps be deposited as metals on the Hastelloy N surfaces outside the
core. Experience in the MSRE indicates that most of the noble-metal
fission products appear in the gas phase of the pump bowl.

Should they all remain in the core of an MSBR, they would signifi-
cantly reduce the breeding ratio. While the cross sections of these
isotopes are not especially large, their combined fission yields account
for nearly a quarter of the total yield of fission products, and the
cross sections of the stable isotopes in the group are, in several instances, -
sufficient to allow saturation to occur in a few years. At saturation, /
the rate of production by the fission of uranium equals the rate of removal
 

 

™

by neutron capture, end the total quantity of the material in the core
becomes constant. The neutron loss--and hence the reduction in breeding
retio--than depends only on ‘the fission product yield, not on the cross
section. The neutron poisoning, Py, at any time t after startup, due to
a particular stable isotope designated by subscript i, is expressed
approximately by

6.1)
- + i (1-e ) ’ (6.
where yy 1s the fission yield of nuclide i, oy is its effective spectrum-

averaged cross section, 9 is the flux in the reactor core, @ is the
cepture-to-fission ratio for the fuel, and £, is the fraction of this -
fission-product specles that is deposited from the fuel salt and remains
in the core. The value of Py gives directly the loss in breeding ratio
associated with this fission product.

Estimates of the amount of poisoning that could result from depo-
sition of these fission products in the core have been made from time to
time during the evolution of the MSBR design. While the fully saturated
poisoning depends very little on details of the reactor design, the rate
of approach to saturation does depend on detailed design paremeters, and
this accounts for some differences in the estimates that have appeared.

Teble 6. 3 gives the maximum reduction in breeding ratio associated
with the stable and very long-lived isotopes of Mo, Te, Ru, Rh, Pd, and
Te, as a function of time after reactor startup or after the instellation
of fresh core graphite. These numbers correspond to complete deposition
on the graphite of the entire yield of each of these isotopes. In some
cases the probability of deposition of the stable poison is assumed to
be associated with the chemical behavior of its precursor. For this
reason, niobium deposition behavior, as well as that of molybdenum, is
importent. The quantity (o®) “1 in Table 6.3 is the time required for a
nuclide to reach sbout 70% of its saturation value. These time constants
are computed for noble metal fission products in the core region of a
single-fluid MSBR, considering a 90% ‘plant factor and a fuel specific
pover in the "core" of 10.7 Mw(t)/kg fissile. The total poisoning in
Table 6.3 is the loss in breeding ratio at the given time after startup;

Results obtained from graphite samples exposed in the MSRE regerding
the behavior of these fission products are discussed in Section 4.2. From
Teble 4.1 it is noted that, on the assumption that the graphite samples
are typlecel of all graphite surfaces exposed to the salt, approximately
10.9% of the ®Mo produced in the MSRE was retained on the graphite as
well as 10.0% of the ¥33re, 6.6% of the °3Ru, and 36.4% of the "Nb. In
using these results to estimate the fraction of the stable fission product
poisons retained on the graphite surfaces in an MSBR, account is teken of
the difference in the ratio of graphite-to-metal area in the two reactors.
In the MSRE, the graphite comprises 63% of the area exposed to salt, where-
as in the single-fluid MSER, the "core" graphite represents about 40%. In
addition, the MSRE results indicate a considerably greater affinity of the
noble metals (except for Nb) for the metal surface than for the graphite
surface. Thus, it is expected that the percentage deposition of noble
metal fission products on graphite in the MSER would be less than in the
MSRE, with the ratio dependent upon the kinetics of the deposition process.
On the basis that fission products have access to all surfaces equally,
their relative deposition on MSBER graphite would be less than one-third
that observed in the MSRE; hovever, since many of the fission products
are generated in the core region, the factor 1s probably sbout one-half.
Thus, in this analysis, the percentage of noble metals retained on ‘the -
MSER graphite is considered to be 5% for Mo, 1328re, and 1°3Ru, and
20% for ®SNb. It is further postulated in view of the small fraction of
these nuclides found in the salt (see Table 4.1) that the deposition is
relatively rapid compared to the decay rate of radioactive precursors
of the steble noble metal poisons; consequently, the deposition fractions
of the stable poisons ere those of their precursors vhere the fission.
yield is zero. Thus, ®5Mo is assumed to be deposited in accordance with
ite precursor SSFb, while the other Mo isotopes and Tc are assumed to

 
 

 

78

behave like ®Mo. Similarly, the behavior of 1°%Rn is assumed to be
governed by that of its precursor 103gy; Pd is elso assumed to behave
like Ru, although its contribution is very small. Finally, in view of

- the marked difference in neutron flux intensities (about tenfold) in

the "core" zone and in the "blanket" zone of the single-fluid reactor,
the expression for saturation of the deposited fission products was modi-
fied by including a separate term for each of the two zones. For the
combined poisoning of all the noble metal fission products listed in
Teble 6.3, the above conditions give the results shown in Table 6.L,

with P(t) and P(t) defined as before.

It EY be seen from Table 6.4 that for exposures of up to 10 years!
duration the degradation in breeding ratio due to deposition of noble-
metal fission products is expected to remain less than 0.01, and the
cumulative average will be smaller still. Inasmuch as the graphite will
probably be replaced because of radiation damage considerations at inter-
vels shorter than 10 years, it appears that the average loss in breeding
ratio will be in the range of 0.002 to 0.005 due to fission product
deposition on the graphite.

Thus, although complete retention of the noble-metal fission pro-
ducts on core graphite leads to a significant reduction in MSER breeding
ratio, the deposition behavior inferred by MSRE results gives only &
small reduction in MSER performance. Additional experimental results
are needed to confirm these preliminary indications.

6.5 Conclusions

Grephite dimensional changes due to exposure in an MSER can alter
the relative volume fractions of moderator, fuel salt, and fertile salt
in the reactor. Such changes influence the design of & two-fluid MSER
more than a single-fluid reactor, since in the latter the fertile and
fissile materiale are mixed together and their ratio does not change
when the graphite volume changes. By constructing a two-fluid reactor
such that the fissile and fertile materials are confined to channels
within the graphite assemblies and the spaces between graphite assemblies
ere filled with helium, changes in graphite volume fraction lead largely
to relative volume change in the helium space. Such volume changes have
only a small effect on fuel cycle performance and on power distribution.
In a single-fluid MSBR, graphite dimensional changes would have little
effect on nuclear performance since the fissile and fertile salt volumes
are equally effected. Also, the ability to independently adjust fissile
end fertile materiel concentrations in both two-fluid end single-fluid
MSER's permits adjustment in reactor performance as changes in graphite
volume occur. Thus, little change in nuclear performance is expected
because of radiation damage to graphite so long as the graphite volume
does not increase much beyond its initisl value and the graphite diffusion
coefficient to gases remains low during reactor exposure (the latter con-
dition neglects the possibility of removing xenon efficlently by gas
stripping).

© A limit on the permissible exposure of the graphite can have a sig-
nificant influence on reactor design conditions. If there vere no ex-
posure limit, the average core power density corresponding to the minimum
power cost would be in excess of 80 kw/liter. However, if a limit exists,
high power density can lead to high cost because of graphite replacement
cost. At the same time, decreasing the core power density leade to an
increase in capital cost and fuel cycle cost. Thus, a limit on permissible

graphite exposure generally requires a compromise between various cost

items, with core power density chosen on the basis of power cost. The
optimum power density also varies with MSBR concept, since only graphite
requires replacement in a single-fluid MSBR, while both the reactor vessel
and graphite appear to require replacement in a two-fluid MSBR because of

 
 

 

 

80

the complexity of constructing the latter core. Further, reactor power
outage due solely to graphite replacement requirements can be a signifi-
cant cost factor. However, if graphite were replaced at time intervals
no less than two years, 1t appears feasible to do the replacement operation
during normal turbine maintenance periods, such that no effective down-
time is assigned to graphite replacement. A two-year time intervel is
associated with an average power density in the power-producing "core"
of sbout 40 kw/liter and a graphite exposure of sbout 3 x 1022 nvt
(E> 50 kev). For the gbove "reference" conditions, the single-fluid
MSER has power costs about 0.35 mill/kvhr(e) lower then the two-fluid
MSER. Doubling the permissible graphite exposure [Fo a value of sbout
6 x 10%2 nvt (E > 50 kev)/ would be more importent to the two-fluid con-
cept and would reduce power costs by about 0.15 mill/kwhr(e); the corre-
sponding change for the single-fluid MSBR would decrease power costs
by ebout 0.07 mill/kwhr(e). If a two-week effective reactor downtime
were assigned solely to graphite replacement operations, the associated
power cost penalty would be about 0.07 mill/kwhr(e) for either concept.
Deposition of noble-metal fission products in the core graphite of
en MSER would tend to lower the nuclear performance of an MSBR. Based on
the results obtained in the MSRE and taking into account the higher
metal/graphite surface area in an MSBER relative to the MSRE, it is esti-
mated that deposition of fission products on the graphite in an MSBER
‘would reduce the breeding ratio by ebout 0.002 on the average if graphite
vere replaced every two years, and about 0.004 if replaced every four
years. Thus, although complete retention of the noble-metal fission
products on core graphite would lead to a significant reduction in MSER
breeding ratio, the deposition behavior inferred from MSRE results corre-
sponds to only & small reduction in MSBR performance.

T. PROGRAM TO DEVELOP IMPROVED GRAPHITE FOR MSBR'S

W. P. Eatherly C. R. Kennedy
D. K. Holmes R. A. Strehlow
Recent work on graphite implies that materials can be developed in
the near future having improved properties for reactor application. The
evallable information supports the hypothesis that resistance to radiation

 

 
 

or

[ C3

81

damage is strongly connected to large crystallite sizes and to minimal
binder content. Since the binder phase is, in general, dominated by
small and highly disoriented crystal structures, these two bases may

‘indeed by synonymous.

In connection with the graphite problem, representatives of ORNL
have visited all U.S. centers where active research on graphite is being
undertaken and all vendors who heave expressed interest in the molten-
salt reactor program. As a result of these visits and our own analyses
of the problem, we have concluded that a graphite research and develop-

‘ment program conducted largely (but not exclusively) at Oak Ridge

National Laboratory is desirable and essential to furtherance of the
molten-salt reactor concept. For convenience the program is divided
into five areas: (1) Fundamental Physical Studies, (2) Fundamental
Chemical Studies, (3) Fabrication Studies, (4) Engineering Properties,
(5) Irradiation Program. . This program is aimed not only at the devel-
opment of a suitable type of graphite, but also et establishing an
improved model for radiation damage which will aid in guiding graphite

| development.

At the present time 1t appears that a radiation damage model can
probably be esteblished vhich will possess predictive capacity and define
the limits of material capsbility in withstanding irradiation. Such a.
model is desirable not only in guiding the development of superior
materials, but also to define the ultimate material limitations on the
reactor concept and design. Our confidence in the establishment of such
a model rests on the emergence of recent techniques offering increased:
control over graphite microstructure, on the continuing development of
new diagnostic techniques which enable one to obtain both quantitative
and qualitative information on microstructures, and on the present indi-
cation that radiation damage at elevated temperatures may be more tract-
gble to analysis. . |
As indicated above, the attainment of improved graphite for molten

salt reactors (viz., lifetimes of 5 to 10 x 10?2 neutrons/cm®) appears
~ possible to enhancement of crystallinity end by minimization of binder

content. These postulates rest primarily on British theories based on
single-crystal experiments, work on pyrolytic graphites at Gulf General

 
 

82

Atomic end irradiation data on certain relatively binder-free graphites.
The most promising routes of attack appear to be catalysis and pressure
carbonization, methods not largely explored by the graphite industry,
particularly with regard to radiation damage.

The development program is summarized in more detail below.

7.1 Fundamental Physicel Studies

The ultimate solution to the problem of increasing the resistance
of graphite to radiation damage may depend upon a fundamental under-
standing of the defect processes underlying the observed property changes.
A coordinated effort should be planned for esteblishing the basic mechan-
isms of radiation demage. Damage models studied to date do not seem to -
offer a completely acceptable explanation of all aspects of the damage
observed at high doses and relatively high temperatures; héwever, such
models do indicate general directions for further investigation.

The crystalline composition of a given graphite seems to play an
important role in the final results of the damage; thus, 1t appears
important to study single crystals, polycrystalline semples, and pyro-
lytics (as transition materiels) in order to better understand this
crystallite~size effect. Because of the high exposures required, it

also seems important to utilize charged particle bombardment (along with

fast neutron irradistions in high flux reactors) in order to permit the
accumulation of irradiation data in & reasonsble time. This, of course,

necessitates the use of thin specimens which may require careful devel-

opment in some cases. :

Various property changes (with irradiation) can be studied in each
graphite material as deemed expedient for best identification of basic
defect structures. Among the most important are dimensional changes,

| lattice spacing changes, and changes in thermal expansion coefficients

and elastic moduli. Obtaining these properties (and others) may require
supplemental work in developing techniques ‘and establishing the precise
property values of material in the unirradiated condition. In particular,
use of electron microscopy in investigating defect clusters and their
growth has already been shown to be of great value and would be of
immediate utility, especially in association with single-crystal

 
 

 

os

.

83

irradiaetions. Additional valusble techniques which have not yet been
exploited edequately are x-ray line shape analyses, optical transmission
and decoration.

Theoretical support of the experimental work is required at three
levels. Any realistic damage model must first involve a set of complex
rate equations which would best be solved by automated analysis. Secondly,
the basic defect energetics and interactions employed in the rate equations
must be studied from the viewpoint of solid state theory. Finally, the
entire model must be related to the directly observable parameters char-
acterizing polycrystalline graphite.

T.2 Fundamental Chemical Studies

Recognition of the experimentally observed relationship between
radiation-induced growth rate and crystallite size give reasonable assur-
ance that an improved graphite cen be developed. Crystallinity is strongly
influenced by chemical changes occurring throughout the graphite manu-
facturing process. Three chemical epproaches to the tailoring of the
crystallite size distribution are: (1) alteration of carbonization con-
ditions for filler-residual binder systems (e.g., carbonization pressure);
(2) elimination of residual binder; and (3) modification of the graphite
by catalytic recrystallization.

Residual binders (those yielding part of the carbon in a graphite
body) carbonize and begin to develop their crystalline habit primarily by

free radical mechanisms with evolution of the gases Hg0, CO, Hp, etc.

This habit of texture persists throughout the graphitizetion process.
Changes in the crystallinity of the final product may be accomplished
by chemical alteration of the binder material and by application ¢ of
pressure during the critical baking operation.

In order to eliminate the residual binder one can utilize fugitive
binders during green article fabrication which can evolve before sub-
stantial hardening of the article occurs. The use of raw or semicalcined
cokes presents a promising course of action because of the inherent
chemical activity of those material. The study of solvent action on
these filler materials is a necessary first step.

 
 

 

8k

Cetalytic modification of grephite has heen demonstrated to yield
en increased crystallite size. Either of two rather distinct mechanisms
may be involved. The first is via a solid-state diffusional path.
Thorium, uranium, end titanium carbides, for example, in the presence of
excess carbon have been observed to improve the graphite crystallinity.

"A second mechanism eppears to be operative for carbides at temperatures

above the eutectic (or peritectic) temperature where a& solution-reprecipi-
tation process can be readily driven by the free-energy differences between

large and small crystallites.

The free-energy differences can also be expected to result in reaction
rate differences; measurements of those rates could augment x-ray studies
of the crystallite size. In view of the difficulty of obtaining crystal-
lite-size distribution data from x-ray analysis, some effort In the field
of chemical kinetics is desirable. Studies of gas evolution and catalyst
removal from carbons at temperatures above 1500°C are expected to assist
further in improvement of process control as well as to provide fundemental
information.

T.3 Fabrication Studies

The fabrication of graphite samples for irradiation and physical
property evaluation is aimed in two complementary directions: first,
to provide the more fundamental programs with controlled test materiels,
and second, to take quick advantage of any information developed by these
programs. It would also include the development of suitable graphite-
joining techniques and pyrolytic-carbon surface impregnation techniques
for control of gas penetration into the graphite. It is envisioned that
the scope of graphite fabrication would not proceed beyond sample prepa-
ration, with scaleup being left to commercial vendors.

The highly specialized nature of graphites suitable for molten-salt
applications required advanced fabrication techniques and strains the
limits of current graphite technology. For these reasons, it has been
our experience that vendor participation can be successfully secured
only if their claims to protection of proprietary information are
respected. On this basis two companies are actively scaling up processes
to supply a graphite epplicable to first cores in an experimental MSER,

 
 

 

 

[2

“©

85

two other companies are actively supplying samples of more advenced
materials, end several others have expressed an interest in subsequent
participation.

Under these circumstances, an in-house capability of supplying
materials for irradietion becomes essential. Only on this basis do
materials become available of known character and controlled variability.
Conversely, as long as vendor interest remains active and substantive,
the difficult problems of process scaleup and control ‘can remain with
commercial suppliers. It is obvious that this approach to the graphite
problem will require close and continued cooperation between ORNL end
commercial suppliers.

T.4 Engineering Properties

Candidate graphite materials must be evaluated and engineering data
generated to obtain the data required for proper design of an MSER core.
This will require that sufficient property values be determined within
reasongble confidence intervals for specifying the design parameters.

The bulk physical properties of the materials must be determined with
particular emphasis on any effects that surface coatings may have. The
mechanical and thermal properties must be critically evaluated with respect
to possible anisotropic behavior. Sensitive properties determining the
compatibility of the graphite with the MSBR environment, such as entrance
pore diameter, accessible pore volume , and penetration characteristics,
must be examined very carefully. Also, the effects of irradiation of
these properties mst be studied carefully, }

Sound methods of quality control must be developed to ensure the
soundness of all material to be used in an MSER core. Techniques devel-
oped to ensure the integrity and effectiveness of coatings and of metal
and/or graphite joints must have a high degree of reliebility. There
must also be development of nondestructive testing techniques and property
interrelstionships to reduce the emount of destructive testing required to
ensure total integrity of the fabricated parts.

 
 

 

 

86

T.5 Irradlstion Program

Initially the irradiation program will be directed to provide eriticel
information assisting both the fundamental and developmental programs.
Eventually the program will be devoted to evaluating candidate materials
and to generating necessary engineering data. These studies require
graphite irradiation exposures to a level where failure occurs or which
exceeds the lifetime requirements of an MSER. This necessitates that
irradiation be done in reactors having high flux levels. Preliminary
experiments In target rod positions in the core of the HFIR have already
been performed and demonstrate the ability to maintain an irradiation
temperature between 690 and T30°C over prolonged periods. This facility
has the capability of accumulating & meximum of 4 x 1022 neutrons/cm®
(E > 50 kev) per year; even with recycling losses, the exposures will be
gbout 3.5 x 1022 neutrons/cm? (E > 50 kev) per year.

The main disadvantages of the HFIR irradiation facility is the small
size which limits the experiments to a 1/2-in.-OD tube. Therefore, it
will be necessary to consider the use of other irradiation facilities for
studies requiring larger samples. These studies will be designed to
determine the combined effects of stress and irradiation on the properties
of graphite and to investigate the possibility of size effect on dimen-
sional stability.

Ion-bonbardment testing is also planned as a means of screening
graphite samples. This treatment would be used either as an adjunct or
as a substitute for high-flux neutron irradiations of graphite. It is
proposed that the feasibility of ion-bombardment testing be examined
thoroughly to determine whether such studies can feed back information
to both fundamental and developmental studies.

T.6 Conclusions

Irradiation results for different grades of graphite have shown that
gross volume changes are a function of crystallite arrangement as well as
size of the individual crystallites. Also, in graphites containing binder
materials, it appears that the binder region has little capacity to
accommodate or control particle strain and thus fractures because of
buildup of mechanical stresses. This indicates that graphites with

improved redistion resistence might be obtained by developing graphites
having little or no binder content. Further, improved radiation resistance
appears to. be associated with isotropic graphites made up of large crystal-
lites. Consequently, a research and development program aimed et producing
improved graphite would emphasize development of graphite having lerge
crystallite sizes and little or no binder content. Such a progrem would
involve physical, chemical, mechanical, febrication, and irradiation
studies, and could lead possibly to graphites with permissible fast neutron
exposures of 5 to 10 x 1022 neutrons/cn® (E > 50 kev).

APPENDIX

Graphite Exposure Measurements and Their Relationships
to Exposures in an MSER

A. M. Perry

Irradiations of near-isotropic graphites have been carried out in
the Dounreay Fast Reactor (DFR), providing information on dimensional
changes as a function of fast neutron dose in the temperature range and
at the high neutron doses of interest in the MSBR. The DFR irradiations
are reported In terms of an Equivalent Pluto Dose (EPD), which investi-
gators in the United Kingdom employ as & standard dose unit in order to
express results of experiments carried out in several different facilities
in directly comparable terms. In order to apply the results of the DFR
irradistions to the MSBR, we must establish.a connection between the
Equivalent Pluto Dose and the irradiation conditions to be expected in
the MSER.

Rather than computing an Equivalent Pluto Dose (EPD) for the MSER,
which would require detailed information on the reference spectrum in
Pluto, it is convenient to establish a correlation between neutron-

induced damage and the integrated neutron flux sbove some standard refer-
ence energy. Such a correlation is extremely useful if it can be shown
that there exists an energy E, such that the ratio of observed damage rate
to the flux above energy E, is essentially the same for all reactor spectra
in which graphite damage is measured or needs to be known. Mathematically
this can be written as,

@

 

[ ® (E) D (E) aE
R(E,) = 0 = (A.1)
fe (E) aE
Eo

where D(E) is a "damage cross section” giving the relative graphite damage
per unit fast neutron flux as a function of neutron energy, ®(E) is the
fast flux per unit of energy, E is neutron energy, and R(E,) is relative

 

 
 

 

od

damage to the graphite. Figure A.l shows the value of D(E) as a function
of energy, based on the carbon scattering cross section, the energy dis-
tribution of primary-carbon-recoil atoms following a neutron collision,
and on the number of carbon atoms displaced from thelr normal lattice
positions by a primary carbon recoil atom as a function of the recoil-
atom energy. This lest function has ‘been calculated by Thompson and
Wright, and predictions based upon it have compared well with experimental
observations.

Figure A.2 shows neutron spectra produced by a fission source in
four widely different neutron moderating materials, these materials being
H20, D0, C, and a mixture of equal volumes of sodium end uranium
(enriched to 20% in the 235U isotope). The last composition is intended
to be representative of a fast reactor core. In Fig. A.3 the function
R(E;) is shown as a function of E, for each of these four spectra.
Since all four curves across within a 4% band at 50 kev, it appears that
the desired correlation exists.

In order to utilize Eq. (A.l) we need the neutron flux exposure above
50 kev corresponding to the EPD in DFR. The total neutron dose in DFR
exceeds the EPD by a factor of 2.16. This is just the reciprocal of the
factor that was used to infer the EFD from the total dose in the first
place. 2 In addition, it is estimated that approximately olf of the
neutron flux in DFR is sbove 50 kev; while this fraction is not accurately
known to us at present, the uncertainty involved is believed to be small.
Thus, the exposure in the DFR to neutrons above 50 kev is (2.16)(0.94) x
(EFD) = 2.0 x (EPD). That is, the EFD scale on the damage curves obtained
from Harwell is converted to dose (based on E> 50 kev) by multiplying
by 2. :

Results of graphite damage experiments in the GETR have been reported
in terms of the dose &bove 180 kev, The spectrum in these experiments was

such thet the dose (E > 50 kev) 1s 1.18 x dose (E > 180 kev).® Thus,
results of the several experiments can be placed on the same dose scale,
for which equal dose should imply equal damage (other factors aleo being
equal) even for widely different spectra such as those in the DFR and in
the GEIR.

Based on the above analysis, the permissible dose (E > 50 kev) for
the MSBR spectrum is equel to twice the Equivalent Pluto Dose. Thus ,
an EPD of 1.5 x 10° nvt in DFR, associated with what appears to be
permissible graphite dimensional changes, corresponds to a permissible
MSER dose (E > 50 kev) of 3 x 102, The flux ebove 50 kev at any point
in an MSER core is very nearly proportional to the power density per unit
of core volume in the vicinity of that point. For an MSER with a central
power density of 100 w/ cc, the assoclated flux sbove 50 kev is about
4.5 x 10** neutrons/cm®-sec, which would produce a dose (E > 50 kev) of
sbout 1.1 x 1022 in one year at 80% plant load factor. Thus, if the
permissible dose (E > 50 kev) is 3 x 102, and if the maximum power
density is 100 w/cm®, then replacement of at least a portion of the
graphite would be required at approximately 2.T7-year intervals. Alter-
natively, if the average "core" power density is 80 w/cc and the power
peaking factor is 2, the time between graphite replacements would be
ebout 1.7 years.
