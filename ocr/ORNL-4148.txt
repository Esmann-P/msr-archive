GAS TRANSPORT IN MSRE MODERATOR GRAPHITE.
I. REVIEW OF THEORY AND COUNTERDIFFUSION EXPERIMENTS

A. P, Malinauskas' J. L. Rutherford R. B. Evans III

ABSTRACT

The authors develop equations describing gas transport in porous media. Since the
“ . i report is directed chiefly to those with little familiarity with gas transport, many simplify-
bY ing assumptions are made in deriving the formulas. Development of the theory proceeds
logically from gas transport of a pure gas in a single capillary, to transport of a binary gas
mixture in a single capillary, to gas flow through a bundle of capillaries, and, finally, to
gas flow through a porous medium. Equations are given for each type of transport. Practi-

Hy

a)

cal applications of the’ theoretical concepts are also shown for a moderator graphite of the
type used in the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE).

The experimental findings are limited but significant. Under MSRE conditions it appears
quite justifiable to ignore normal diffusion effects in gas transport computations. This
means that all the gaseous diffusion information necessary to correlate fission product
migration data may be gained through simple permeability measurements; the more complex
interdiffusion experiments are not required. Thus a complete flowproperty survey of all
MSRE moderator materials can be performed with a minimum expenditure of time and effort.

EE | ~~ 1 INTRODUCTION

~

<0 Much has been written on the subject of gas transport in porous media; hence one is somewhat
apprehensive in writing another report on the subject, lest he add to the extant confusion rather

than clarify some of the concepts which have become confused. Nonetheless, we have encountered

 

sufficient misinterpretations or misapplications of derived expressions to warrant an additional work
"as desirable, particularly for those with little or no familiarity with gas transpott.
| Furthermore, the complications introduced by the presence of a porous medium have spawned
numerous models, most of which do little more than add computational complexity or can easily
| "mislead the uninitiated into making totally incorrect correlations among geometric parameters. This
| report has therefore been written with two primary putposes in mind: first, we seek to ‘convey to
| the reader an appreciation of the concepts associated with gas transport in general, and second, we
| \. attempt to demonstrate how the geometric aspects of the problem which are introduced in dealing

with porous septa may be handled efficiently.

 
 

 

Since. our principal audience is intended to be those wishing to become familiar with the sub-
ject, rather than co-workers in the field, we have striven to keep the theoretical treatment as simple
as possible. Thus, for example, only isothermal transport is considered. Similarly, in some in-
stances mathematical rigor has been compromised for clarity in presentation, although the rigorously

derived expressions are likewise given and noted accordingly. Bibliographical references have

“also been omitted; all too frequently these prove to be bothersome interruptions. For those wishing

a more detailed treatment, we strongly recommend the treatises listed in the Appendix.
We shall begin our discussion by introducing the various definitions of velocity and flux which
will be encountered throughout this work, and then turn our attention to the actual task at hand,
namely, the presentation of the concepts associated with gas transport. This will be done by con- .

sidering several types of gas transport. The simplest of these, hence the first to be treated, in-

volves pure gas flow in a single capillary as the result of an applied pressure drop. Next, trans- 5
~ port in a binary gas mixture will be considered; here pressure- and concentration-induced transport Co &
will be treated, but we shall still limit the discussion to only a single capillary. This limitation . Co.

will then be removed by first allowing the gas to be transported through a bundle of identical capi!-
laries, in order to gain some familiarity with the geometrical aspects of the problem, and then we
shall proceed to the case involving a porous medium.
The theoretical portion will be essentially completed with the latter problem, but to conclude
here would probably be an injustice to those seeking practical applications of the theory. Accord- .

ingly, we have included a second section; this part is experimental in scope. In order to demon-

- strate the application of the theoretical concepts and to present a reasonably detailed description

of the experimental aspects, the gas transport characteristics of a particular graphite specimen are
determined by way of example. Although any porous medium would have sufficed, the experimental

data which are presented have been determined for a graphite of the type employed in the Molten-

Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE). The data thus serve an additional purpose; they may be used at Y
least as an estimate of the extent of gaseous fission product migration in the MSRE graphite. <

lil. THEORY OF GAS FLOW IN POROUS MEDIA
Velocity and Flux Definitions

The molecules which comprise an ordinary gas mixture do not possess a single, common

velocity but exhibit a broad range of values. Thus, in describing the motion of a gas in terms of

the motions of the individual molecules, one utilizes a statistical approach. It is convenient there-

fore to define a “velocity distribution function’ f(v) which represents the number of molecules per
unit volume whose velocities lie within the rangé dv about v (where v is a volume vector in velocity
space). In a gas mixture, one such distribution function fv) is defined for each component. If

n, is the total number of molecules of type 7 per unit volume, then
= ftvpdv,, | 6H!
. /

where the integration is carried out over a velocity volume containing all possible values of v,.

The average value @; of any quantity which is a function of v, is given by

thus, as an example, the average velocity of component i in a gas mixture is

of v, when only the magnitude, but not the direction, is considered.

 
 

 

 

We are concerned in most laboratory experiments with the number of i molecules which traverse
a given cross section during a specified period of time, and for this purpose we introduce the flux

which is defined as the rate of transport of the i-type molecules per unit area. The total flux of .

the gas is obtained simply by adding up the fluxes of the individual components, so for a »-com-

ponent mixture,

Alternatively, we could write an expression for J which is similar in appearance to Eq. (5), thus:
. J=mnu, | SM

in which n= 3, i; represents the molecular density of the gas as a whole. If we compare Egs. ©

and (7), we see that the equations are consistent provided

i=1
thus u turns out to be just the number-average velocity of the gas mixture.” Note, however, that a
gas mixture at rest (u = 0) does not necessarily imply that transport within the mixture is absent.
Similarly, when momentum transport is of interest, it is convenient to employ a ‘‘mass-average
velocity” v, such that one can describe the momentum of the gas per unit volume as if all of the

molecules possess the same velocity. This quantity is defined by the relation

v
Vo = 1/p) y nmv, , © .
i=1 TN
where p = z n,m, is the mass density’ of the gas. Finally, it is often advantageous to employ what -

is described as the * ‘peculiar velocity” Vv, which is defined by the relation

V,=%,-v,. : | Qo)

The peculiar velocity thus represents the average velocity of the i-type molecules measured with

respect to the mass-average velocity of the gas as a whole. In other words, we allow our co-
ordinate system itself to move with the velocity v v,- From Egs. (9) and (10) we therefore obtain

the relation

Unfortunately, v, is also referred to as the “diffusion velocity’’; as a consequence, nV, is : -
often misinterpreted as the diffusive flux of component i, and Eq. (11) misapplied to yield er- :

roneous results. Later on in this report we shall have occasion to define a diffusive velocity,
and we caution the reader that Eq. (10) is not to be equated with this quantity. Accordingly, we
will differentiate between the velocities by referring to v, as the peculiar velocity, and will
introduce another symbol for the diffusion velocity.

Thus far we have accepted the fact that either the gas as a whole or several of the com-
ponents which comprise it are in motion, and we have formulated various definitions to aid us
in describing the motion. In order to introduce additional, equally useful quantities, we now
consider the mechanisms of gas transport. Under isothermal conditions, these modes of trans-
port fall into two distinct categories: ) forced or viscous flows, which result from gradients
of the total pressure, and (2) diffusive flows, in which gradients of partial pressure provide the
driving force. We now associate with each of these types of flow a Corresponding flux, so that
J iv is interpreted as the flux of component i due to viscous transport, and J, represents the
flux resulting from diffusive transport. Each of these fluxes is associated with a corresponding

velocity. Thus the viscous velocity of component i may be defined as
Uy = Jiv/ny , } ! 12)
and the diffusive velocity by the expression
\ Yin =Jin/n; . (13)

Now consider the flow of a binary gas mixture, of components 1 and 2, in a capillary. If the

flux of component 1 is J . , and that for component 2 is J 9» We can immediately write

Ji=Tiy+ lips CL (142)

Limba, 148)
The total flux J, on the other hand, may be written either in the form ' oo

I=1,41, LE asa)
or |

I=l, +1. DE oo asp

The problem now is to ensure that there is no external coupling between the J 1} and the J in
in other words, we must define the fluxes (or the velocities) in such a manner that viscous
terms do not appear in the expression for J ip» NOT that diffusive terms appear in the formula for
J; It tums out that this can be done very easily provided we account for surface effects in
terms of a diffusive mechanism. To be sure, the equations ate still coupled, but this coupling
is indirect; it occurs through the boundary conditions and the composition dependence of the
transport coefficients associated with the two modes of transport. ‘As a result, it is usually
necessary to solve the viscous flow equation and the diffusive flow equation simultaneously,

and this can become quite complicated.

 
 

 

 

The viscous part, when defined as outlined above, is nonseparative; this permits us to ap- --
portion the total viscous flux to the individual components in accordance with their mole frac-

tions, thus:
Jiw=xJ, | ~ - (164)
. Jav =x,J. . i (165)

In terms of velocity, this implies that the viscous velocity associated with J, is common to all’

of the components in the mixture. That is, in the case in question,

Uv = Uv *

’ Unfortunately, a similar apportionment for the diffusive part is not possible. The r reason for
this stems primarily from the two different viewpoints which are used to describe the mechanisms; iB
in treating viscous transport, we can look upon the gas as a continuum, but in dealing with dif-
/fusive flow (including surface effects) one must differentiate among the types of encounters >’
which the individual gas molecules undergo. -
The solution to a given problem can therefore be reduced to obtaining expressions for the

relations
J Tip +5, ,
J, yA +x,0,

J=J, +1],

\

in terms of the driving forces and the characteristics of the gas and porous septum. Although
the most general case would involve a multicomponent mixture with an unspecified number of
components, the most complicated case considered to date has been that for which only two
components are involved. This presents no difficulty in applying the equations to multicom- - : %
ponent systems in which all but one of the components are present in trace quantities, however, 4
because under this condition all other trace components can be safely ignored when considering
the transport of any one.
It is now instructive to take up the problem of the flow of a pure gas through a single straight
capillary, since this provides the simplest illustration of the concepts and definitions which have
been presented above. In this case the problem degenerates to writing a solution only for the

~ equation

gradient. If we do not allow turbulence and confine the treatment to the hydrodynamic region,

then the equation of motion of the gas is given by

(dp/dz) = (1/£X3/30) lnedv, 136), oo an

- in which (dp/dz) represents the pressure gradient, r is the radial distance parameter, and 7g

denotes the viscosity coefficient of the gas. Integration of this equation over the limits r= 0

andr=r yields, after some manipulation,
me? dp = 271r dz) (nv, / an), : (18)

which is simply the force balance expression for a cylinder of fluid of cross-sectional area mre?

and length dz. The left-hand side denotes the applied force on the fluid, whereas the right-hand -

side represents the shear force (tangential stress). If the fluid is not accelerated, then these

forces are, of course, equal.
An expression for the mass-average velocity v, can now be obtained by integrating Eq. (18)

over the limits r=rand r = Tos where 1, is the radius of the capillary. Thus
vo(0) = [2 — r2)/4n)(-dp/dz) + uy, . 19)

in which uj =v o(fo ). We therefore see that under conditions of laminar flow, the mass-average
velocity profile is parabolic.

© So far we have found it convenient to describe the gas transport i in terms of the mass-average

“velocity, but in the laboratory we are concerned instead with the number-average velocity. At

this point it is therefore advantageous to seek out a relation between these two average quan-
tities. In the case of a pure gas no difficulty is encountered; as can be readily seen from Eqs.

(8) and (9), the two velocities turn out to be identical, and we can immediately write
oe) = vo) = (2 = VAR (dp/d) + uy. Qo

All that remains to be done now is to average u(r) over the (assumed uniform) cross section of

-the capillary. The result is given by

a= (2/8 dp/dD) + ug RE @1)
The flux of molecules which pass through any given cross section of the tube is then ob-
tained from the relation ) ln
J=nu. Co oy
Thus, by ‘substituting for n the well-known formula -
n= p/kT ; |

we derive an expression which relates the measured flux to the viscosity of the gas, the geom-

etry of the capillary, and the pressure gradient which causes the gas to flow; this is given by

J = (2/8nXo/kTX~ dp/dz) + nu, . (22)

 
 

 

thus the individual diffusive fluxes, J ip’ are given by

10

Nothing has been said about the extra term, nu , which appears in Eq. (22). We shall main-
tain this silence for a little while longer, except to point out that it appears as the result of a
boundary condition.

If we retrace the derivation ‘of Yo , this time for a gas mixture, we again find that the mass-

average velocity averaged over the cross section of the capillary is given by

Vo = (2/81)~ dp/ds) + + ug ,

where 7 now refers to the viscosity of the mixture. One can therefore always write

0, = Vy = tg = (2/81X~dp/d2) , Ce

®

J, =nu = : /80Xp/kTX— dp/d2) . Lo Co : 24)

This'is the definition of the viscous flux which we had mentioned earlier. In order to obtain an”

expression for the diffusive flux, we manipulate Eq. ® into the form

u= a/m Ein, ruy=—v) ru,

Jip =04p = nV, + uy — vo) = nV, + up). (25)

The comesponding diffusive velocities therefore represent the average velocities of the molecules
measured with respect to a hypothetical mass-average velocity which is derived from the equation
of motion under the assumption v(r,) = 0 [see Eq. (19)].

By means of these definitions we have’ solved the viscous or forced-flow part for all of the

cases in which it arises; the answer is

J, = (c2/8n)p/kTX—dp/dz) ; (26) Ca

o
we shall now turn our attention to ‘the diffusive part of the problem.

Slip Flow in Capillaries. — Equation (26) turns out to be a rather good approximation at high

. pressurés for flow through large tubes, but at low pressures and for small-diameter tubes, the

“slip flow’’ contribution, nu, can become quite significant. We must therefore express nu in

,
terms of those quantities which are amenable to measurement in the laboratory. To 'do this, we
shall take advantage of the separability of the viscous and diffusive parts of the problem. Con-
ceptually, then, in the case of a pure gas, we are considering the transport of n molecules per
unit volume which have a drift velocity u, and are under the influence of a pressure gradient.
Now considera volume element —7rl dz within the capillary. ‘The molecules will receive a net

forward momentum per unit time equal to —7rr2(dp/ dz) dz. If the gas is not to be accelerated,

. this momentum per unit time must be lost to the capillary walls. ] CO)

Of the nme dz molecules, let the fraction (1 — f) collide with the wall in a specular manner;
in this type of collision the angle of incidence equals the angle of rebound, and there is no

change in the z component of the velocity (in this case u,, on the average). For these colli-

0’
sions there is no net transport of momentum; thus they can be ignored in the rate-of-momentum-
transfer balance. On the other hand, let the remaining fraction f be collisions in which the mole-
cules rebound from the wall in a completely random manner (diffuse scattering). For these
collisions, on the average, the z component of the momentum which is transferred in the direc-
tion from the wall to the gas is zero, so that the net rate at which the momentum is lost to the
wall is simply the rate at which it is transferred in the direction from the gas to the wall. ‘The
rate at which the molecules strike the surface is (1/4)nc (27, dz), and of these collisions, per
unit time, (f/4)nC(277r, dz) actually transfer momentum to the wall. In each case, on the average,

the momentum mu, is transferred, so the momentum balance is given by

Although the derivation just presented is by no means rigorous, it is correct in spirit and
is consistent conceptually with a similar type of derivation which will be given later in connec-
tion with binary gaseous diffusion. Another derivation, which likewise is lacking in mathematical

rigor, yields (2 — f)/f in place of the factor 2/f. Since f appears to be very nearly equal to

unity, the two expressions differ by about a factor of 2. Equation (27) does in fact overestimate

the effect of slip flow, primarily because of simplifications in. the derivation, so we shall-adopt

the commonly quoted result,
ng = (r,/m&) (2 — a dp/dz) (28)
The diffusive flux J, is therefore given by | |
Jy =nug = (ey aD [2 ~ 0/1) (— dpa), (29)
and the total flux is obtained by adding Eqs. (26) and (29) to yield |
| J=J,+Jp = {(e/8nXo/KT) + (7/8) (egS/KT) (2-0/0 (~dp/dz). (30)

This expression is usually presented in the form

and then attempted to express the “Knudsen diffusion coefficient,” D_, in terms of the charac-

K

teristics of the capillary and the gas. By comparing the slip term in Eq. (31) with Eq. (33), we"

see that the result should be equivalent to

Dy =5EK,, : oo | 34)

and we shall accept this result without further justification.
This completes the discussion of pure gas transport; we now turn our attention to the trans-

port characteristics of binary gas mixtures. Since the viscous part of the problem has already

been worked out, we need only consider the diffusive aspects. We shall therefore begin by a

ignoring viscous flow completely.

Binary Gas Mixture Transport

Counterdiffusion in Capillaries. — A typical experimental setup for investigating diffusion
processes in capillaries or porous media is sketched in Fig. 1. The septum (either a single
capillary, an array of parallel capillaries, or a porous medium) is sealed into a container so that
its ends may be swept with two initially pure component gases. The extent of the counterdiffu-
sion through the barrier is then determined from measurements of the degree of contamination of
the two sweep streams. C0 |

To simplify the sign convention, we shall choose the positive z direction as the direction of
transport of the lighter component; this component will always be designated as component 1.
We now seek to describe the transport, in particular the diffusive transport, in terms of the
characteristics of the two components and the geometry of the septum (in this case a single
capillary). To accomplish this end, we again consider the rate of transport of momentum under x
steady-state conditions.

Within the volume element me) "dz in the capillary, the molecules of component 1 will receive

wy

a net forward momentum per unit time which is equal to — —7t2(dp,/ dz) dz.. This is the same ex-
pression written down earlier, except that we now employ a gradient of partial pressure. How-
ever, it is now possible for the component 1 molecules to lose this momentum in two ways: (1)
to the capillary walls, as-in the previous case, and (2) to component 2 molecules.

Note that there can be no transfer of momentum due to collisions among molecules of the
same component. This is readily demonstrated by considering a head-on collision (partly for
simplicity) between two molecules which are identical in every respect except velocity. Let .
molecule A, with velocity v,» collide head-on with molecule B, whose velocity is v,. As a

_ result of the conservation of momentum, the velocity of molecule A will be vy after the colli-
sion, whereas that of molecule B will be v,. But since the molecules are identical, we can OU
* interchange even our designations A and B after the collision. In other words, to an observer

by considering the average number of collisions which the molecules make with the walls in

Although we have ‘written three equations to describe binary gas transport through capillaries,
namely, Eqs. (41), (43), and (44), only two of these are independent; any one can be derived by

suitably combining the other two. The limiting forms of these relations in the free-molecule

be

region (p»0) and the hydrodynamic region (p + =) can be readily obtained by inserting the
values presented in Table 1 for the various diffusion parameters.

A very important result is obtained from Eq. (44) for diffusion under conditions of uniform :

as Graham's law of effusion. Equation (45) has been derived under no special conditions rela-

* free-molecule region. Although this relation was also stated quite explicitly by Graham, in fact

several years prior to his effusion studies, it apparently was either forgotten or misinterpreted.

Nonetheless, this is Graham’s law of diffusion, and has been experimentally verified by many

investigators. Note also that it is impossible to obtain zero net flow (J = 0) under uniform

pressure conditions unless D, =D, .

Thus far we have restricted the treatment to transport through a single capillaty; in the next
section we extend this treatment first to a bundle of parallel capillaries and then to porous media.
Pore Geometry and Overall Coefficients. — Consider a cylindrical solid with a bulk volume

given by 7r’L which contains N identical capillaries, each of volume ral. If the axes of the
individual capillaries do not coincide with the axis of the cylinder, then the length I will be
greater than L; therefore let g!/2 = I/L. The porosity or relative void volume € of the cylinder
is given by h

Need
€= .
mr’L

 

If we insert the definition of the tortuosity gq into the above expression and rearrange, we find

_that the number of identical capillaries in the cylinder can be described by the relation

N € (=) :
ia) BE

The total flow of molecules measured relative to the geometry of the solid is J(rr?); this
must be numerically equivalent to N J (713), where J denotes the flux of molecules through

any one of the N identical pores. Hence

However, the flux J is expressed as the product of two quantities, the gradient of some parameter

which is causing the flux and a proportionality constant. In general, then,

“Two of the coefficients of interest incorporate 1, to some power; thus it is advantageous to

account for this fact by writing c, = cori, so that Eq. (46) may be rewritten in the form

In the case of normal diffusion, co = D,, and (j - 2) = 0, but for Knudsen diffusion,

m_
Co =3 Ci le- - p/1f]

and the exponent (j — 2) is unity, whereas for viscous transport, co = p/8n and G- 2-= 2.

The situation involving a bundle of uniform identical capillaries is highly idealized; although
we can consider many other geometrical models which are more complex but still tractable math-
ematically, their exposition will provide little insight conceming the geometrical characteristics

of a typical porous medium. In the language of the pore or capillary concept, such septa must
be regarded as consisting of amyriad of nonuniform interconnected capillaries of widely varying
lengths. One i is therefore faced not only with averaging the pore radius r,, over the number of
capillaries (from m = _Otom= N), but also over the individual lengths 1, of the capillaries.
Moreover, all of the void volume € need not contribute to flow (blind pores, for example), and we:
shall denote this fact by using the symbol €” to signify that part of € which is s actually involved
in gas transport. - -

It is therefore quite obvious that the specification of the geometry of a porous medium re- .
quires such fine detail that a complete solution of the problem will almost certainly never be
obtained. Nonetheless, we can set up the gas transport equations in a formal manner and thereby
reduce the problem to obtaining only a few parameters’ experimentally.

We start by defining the effective porosity €” in the following way:

"tacitly assumed that such factors as cross-linking, nonuniformity down the length of a given pore,

and shape have already been taken into account.

Fortunately for everyone ’s sanity, permeability measurements are not too difficult to perform,
so we let nature do the averaging processes for us. Except for the factor fin K, which is
independent of the gas to a good approximation anyway, both By, and K, depend only upon the
geometry of the medium. Under steady-state conditions, then, we can integrate Eq. (52) to yield

two faces of the porous medium, and JkT is the flow, in pressure-volume units per unit time, per
unit cross section of the medium. Hence B and K, can be obtained from the slope and inter-
cept, respectively, of a plot of the left-hand side of Eq. (54) vs ( p>. Once determined, these
parameters are invariant to the choice of gas and appear to remain reasonably constant with
respect to temperature and time. |

In concluding this section, we should like at least to partially dispel the impression which

the reader may have received from our discussion with regard to the utility of porosity and pore- -

size distribution data, It is quite true that if one is interested in small differences in the trans-

" port characteristics of two septa, for example, any inferences which are drawn from the pore-size

* distributions of the two samples and later verified by experiment are unquestionably fortuitous.

As a rule of thumb, however, one can state that the permeability generally increases with in-
creasing porosity and that of two specimens having approximately the same porosity, the one
with the larger pores will give the higher permeability values. Moreover, one can make inferences
from pore-size distribution data if large differences are involved, but even these should be
verified by experiment. |

Gas Transport in a Static Dust Environment. — In our derivations of the diffusive part of the
gas transport problem, we nonchalantly made a number of assumptions in order to keep the presen-
tation and the mathematics as simple as possible. For example, we assumed that the average
rate of momentum transfer was equal to the average number of collisions times the average
momentum transferred per collision. The average of a product, in general, only approximates the
product of the averages. In fact, such approximations led to overestimates of the rate of mo- -
mentum transfer in the simplified treatments, but it was a relatively simple matter to ‘‘properly”
adjust the co.{"i~iente because we knew what the answer was beforehand. The correct expres-
sions were no. ubtai... <1 an application of the capillary flow concept, but rather from a —

The physical description is as follows: Suppose we have an agglomerate of giant gas mole-
cules (dust) which are uniformly distributed and fixed in space. For simplicity, let all of these
molecules be of exactly the same size. If two gases are allowed to interdiffuse through the ag-
glomerate, the process can be described as diffusion of a ternary gas mixture, that is, a mixture
of gases 1 and 2 and the dust d.

The diffusive flux relationships for such systems under isothermal conditions are ‘obtained

from the Stefan-Maxwell diffusion equations:

where d; repiesents a combination of driving forces. The primed quantities indicate that the
dust is to be included in the counting process; thus n” =n, + n, + n, = n + n,, where the un-
primed quantities refer only to the gas. This poses no problems, since nD ij = nD; and dn’/dz =
dn/dz, the latter by virtue of the postulated uniform density of the dust (dn J dz = o

For the ternary mixture considered here, we have three equations of the form given above -
one each for j= 1, 2, and d ~ but only two of these are independent. Also note that although the
gases are not acted upon by an external force, there is an external force F ; which acts upon the
dust, namely, that clamping force which keeps the dust particles stationary. The clamping force

viously, except that one now takes some suitably averaged value of the dust radii. The trans-
port coefficient ‘expressions for gas flow in porous media which are obtained from the capillary

Summary

In the preceding sections of this report we have attempted to present, in as simple a manner
as possible, the various flow equations which are encountered in dealing with isothermal trans-
port in porous media. We can best summarize this portion by pointing out that any isothermal
gas transport problem involving a porous septum is completely specified by Eqs. (41) and (44),

provided the coefficients D D,,, and B, are modified to take into account the nuances of

iK’
pore geometry. -
Unfortunately, an a priori method for evaluating the suitably modified coefficients is unlikely
to be had; recourse must therefore be made to experiment. However, the only measurements
required are a few permeability determinations with a single gas and a few counterdiffusion ex-
periments with a single gas pair. This is relatively easy to accomplish. Once this is done,
the septum is completely ‘characterized; that is, the transport behavior of any gas under a given
set of conditions may be predicted with confidence. |
In the experimental portion of this work we shall demonstrate: (1) how the geometry of the

. septum is characterized through permeability and counterdiffusion experiments, and (2) how the

results may be applied to gases and conditions other than those employed in the experiments.

Appropriately, we have chosen to use a graphite specimen of the MSRE type.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL
Description of MSRE Graphite and the Experimental Specimen

Little will be gained at this time if we consider details of the manufacture of the MSRE
graphite. To be sure, the fabrication procedures significantly affect the transport characteristics
of the finished material and become quite important if property variations within the specimen
or an intercomparison of various types of graphite are of interest. However, in the present
case we concern ourselves only with a single type of graphite and moreover concentrate on the

transport characteristics of the material as a whole. A detailed consideration of its manufacture

"thus becomes academic, so only those aspects which are pertinent to this limited objective are
. . . ~ So '

presented.

-In the original design concepts of the molten-salt reactor, intrusion of the salt into the
graphite was regarded as an intolerable contingency. As a result, a material of low permeability
was demanded. Such low-permeability graphite is usually obtained by applying additional,
special treatments, beginning with a modified porous nuclear-grade graphite. These treatments

involve injecting a suitable impregnant into the base stock which, upon undergoing heat treat-

ment, deposits a char within the pores of the graphite.

As is illustrated by the photomicrograph comp arison of NC-CGB-BS (base stock) and NC- +
CGB (impregnated stock) in Fig. 2, impregnation treatments considerably lessen the pore space
within the graphite. This difference in pore size likewise accounts for the observed difference

in the penetrability of the two graphites by molten salt, which is also shown in Fig. 2.

exposure to malten salt at 704°C and 11 atm pressure. =

One might logically expect that, as a result of impregnation treatments, the end product
would exhibit property variations along directions normal to the impregnation surfaces, particularly
near the surfaces of the graphite, where impregnation should be especially effective, Insofar as
MSRE graphite is concerned, the nonhomogeneity is probably mitigated somewhat by subsequent
machining operations which are required to produce the final dimensions of the material, and we.
shall explore this facet in a later report. For the present, however, we choose to concentrate -
on the material as a whole,
The MSRE utilizes the graphite in the form of 6-ft-long bars which have a cross section of
3.08 in.2. All four sides of each bar are slotted along the entire 6-ft length; these slots provide \C’

the flow channels for the molten salt.” The flow specimen was machined from one of these bars.

Our choice of sample geometry and location in the MSRE graphite bar was governed by the
following objective, namely, to obtain information regarding the relative contributions of Knudsen
and hydrodynamic transport to the overall flow pattern. This requires both permeability and
counterdiffusion experiments, and these, in turn, require samples which have a large surface-
area-to-thickness ratio, as well as a reasonable degree of uniformity. Since the bar was expected
to exhibit considerable nonuniformity and a high Knudsen contribution in the regions near its
surfaces, we decided to obtain the flow specimen from its center. .This position is defined in
Fig. 3; in this location uniformity, normal diffusion effects, and porosity may be considered

maximal.

cylinder whose axis coincided with the extrusion axis of the bar, For this geometry, the area-

to-length ratio A/L is obtained from the radial steady-state flow relationship for a uniform

material,

characterized by the following geometrical parameters:

Gas Transport Characterization of the Diffusion Septum

Apparatus and Procedure. — Mutual diffusion coefficient determinations involving binary gas
mixtures are generally made under transient conditions in an apparatus whose geometry is well
defined and known. Moreover, the system is closed throughout the course of the experiment,
thereby forcing the diffusion rates of the two components to be equal. In the present work,
however, we employed a steady-state method, and this required that the system be open.

The approach used by us was originally developed by Wicke for his investigations of ad-
sorbed CO, surface diffusion in porous media; a CO,-N, mixture was swept across one face of
a porous septum, whereas the opppsite face was swept with a stream of pure N, in such a manner
that no pressure gradient was imposed across the septum. Although the CO, diffusion rate was

determined in his studies, Wicke unfortunately ignored the N, diffusion rate. Somewhat later,

~ Hoogschagen adopted the Wicke procedure and added one important modification; he monitored

the degree of contamination of both sweep streams, This led to the rediscovery of Graham’s

law of diffusion. (Ironically, Hoogschagen's rediscovery of Graham’s law and Soret’s earlier

use of this law to verify the formula O, for ozone were also confused by workers in the field!)
Figure 4 is a photograph of the diffusion cell assembly which was used in this work; the

components, from left to right in the figure, are: Ar sweep-gas outlet tube and thermocouple;

septum container; diffusion septum, container cap, and fittings; and the He sweep-gas flow guide

ahd septum end cap. The end caps were attached to the graphite cylinder with epoxy resin to ef- -

fect a gas-tight seal and to define the surface of the septum available to gaseous diffusion.

The counterdiffusion experiments were performed by sweeping the inner surface of the diffusion

septum with He and the outer surface with Ar and analyzing the effluent streams for the corre-

sponding contaminant. Pure helium was introduced into the upper T-joint which is shown in Fig.
4 and made to flow down the annulus formed by the A and Y%-in. tubing. The gas then entered
the inner section of the septum in the region of the upper end cap and was withdrawn at the
base of the flow guide through the %-in. tubing. In a similar manner, pure argon was admitted
to the outer surface of the specimen through the T-joint adjacent to the container cap and with-
“drawn at the base of the container through the %-in. outlet tube.
A drawing of the entire flow system is shown in Fig. 5. Uniform pressure conditions were’

obtained by adjusting the control valves'R , R,, R,, and R, until the pressure drop Ap across

- the sample (as determined with a mercury differential manometer) was zero. After sweeping its

respective side of the porous medium, each effluent stream was passed through one of a pair of
thermostated thermal conductivity cells (T) for gas composition analysis. Continuous compari-

son with streams of the corresponding pure gases under identical flow conditions was accom-

plished by adjusting the control valves Ry and R, until the rotameter pairs (F) indicated equal

flow rates. Back-diffusion of air into these reference streams was minimized by venting the
gases through 12 ft of coiled Yin. copper tubing, whereas the sweep streams were passed
-hrough dibutyl phthalate bubblers (B) before being admitted into the calibrated wet-test meters
(S). In about half the experiments the gas composition analyses were obtained with a mass

spectrometer. For these runs the samples were withdrawn from sampling ports located at T,

Previously calibrated Bourdon gages (G) provided measurements’ of the pressures at which the

experiments were performed.

The permeal _lity data were likewise obtained with this apparatus. This was accomplished
by closing one of the inlet valves and the outlet valve of the opposite flow stream (e.g., R, and
R). oT :

All of the gases employed in this work were found to be at least 99.9% pure. Analyses of
the helium and argon supplies indicated a free oxygen content in the range between 1 and 4 ppm
and water contents from 10 to 15 ppm. Thus, no further attempts at purification were undertaken.

Permeability Results. — Since the techniques usually employed to obtain permeability data
appear in abundance in the open literature, a detailed discussion on our part is unwarranted.

We therefore merely outline the calculational procedure in this section.
The integrated steady-state equation that applies to the diffusion septum permeability meas-

urements is given by

p,0, =K(A/L) Ap,

where the permeability coefficient of component i is

K, = (B,/1,)¢ pr) + Dy . (56)

In our experiments, the effluent volumetric flow rate Q o is determined at the barometric
pressure p, by means of the calibrated wet-test meters; the pressure drop Ap.= p(0) — p(L)
across the septum is measured with the mercury differential pressure manometer which is shown
in Fig. 5; and, finally, the arithmetic mean pressure (p) = Y%[p(0) + p(L)] is determined from
readings of the barometric pressure and the calibrated Bourdon gages.

‘Diffusion septum permeability coefficients were determined at 22.5°C for three gases: hydro-
gen, helium, and argon. The resultant experimental data are presented in Table 3 and are
graphically displayed in Fig. 6 as a function of the mean pressure ( p) . In accord with the
linear relation, Eq. (56), these data have been smoothed using a linear least-squares procedure;
the solid lines which appear in Fig. 6 thus represent the smoothed data and form the basis for
the determination of the permeability parameters which are tabulated in Table 4.

Although the quantity Vi, D,, and the viscous-flow coefficient B should depend only upon

the graphite structure and therefore be independent of the gas, some variation in these values

‘has been noted. These discrepancies are. probably indicative of the experimental errors in-

volved; hence an average of the values for VI, D, and B which were obtained from the helium
and the : argon data has been taken to be representative of these quantities when we consider the
He-Ar counterdiffusion data. o

Helium-Argon Counterdiffusion Results. — All of the counterdiffusion experiments were con-
ducted under conditions of uniform pressure; hence the data were correlated in accordance with

the constant-pressure form of Eq. (41),

For this case D,_ and Oye are constant over the length z= 0toz = L, and Eq. (57) can be

integrated and rearranged to yield an expression for the effective diffusion coefficient Dye, in

The importance of obtaining values'of the Knudsen coefficient D before performing dif-
fusion experiments is readily realized by noting its appearance in Eq. (59). Furthermore, as a

result of this auxiliary equation the expression for D Eq. (58), is a transcendental rela-

HeAr’
tion. Accordingly, it must be solved by an iterative technique. The number of iterations re-
quired of course depends upon the value that is chosen as a first approximation to D,_, , and
if one makes a poor choice the convergence can be painfully slow. It is therefore desirable to
obtain as good a first approximation as possible. If several diffusion experiments are performed
at different pressures, the most convenient method is as follows: For each experiment one cal-
He a, fom Eq. (58) by taking Oyo =1. If the reciprocals of

the values so obtained are then plotted against 1/p, the intercept corresponds to the “true”

culates an ‘““apparent’’ value of nD

value of nD, aA. Since, as we have remarked earlier, > 1 as 1/p » 0. Moreover, the plots fre-
quently appear to be almost linear, so that the required extrapolation is generally straightfor-
ward. - )

The He-Ar counterdiffusion data which were obtained with the diffusion septum are presented

in Table 5. Two series of experiments were performed: in the first, the extent of contamination
of the two sweep streams was adjusted to be about 1 mole % and the analyses were performed

with a mass spectrometer; in the second series, the degree of contamination was held at about

~ 0.2 mole %, and thermal conductivity cells were employed in the sweep-stream analyses. The

diffusion coefficients which are tabulated have been computed in accordance with Eq. (58),
where the value of D,__ has been taken to be 4.69 x 10~* cm?/sec, as discussed previously.
The first approximation to nD, _, , as determined by the intercept method described above, was
2.85 x 108 mole cm™! sec™?; the rapid convergence which was obtained by this method is
readily seen by comparing this value with the “final’’ results in the table.

Except for the geometric factor (¢’/q”), the diffusion coefficient D,, Ac is given by Eq. (40);
thus the values presented in Table 5 should vary linearly with reciprocal pressure. This de- .
pendence is illustrated in Fig. 7.

Parameters for Fission Product Diffusion in MSRE Graphites. — We are now in a position to
apply the information which has been obtained thus. far to cases of interest to the Molten-Salt
Reactor Experiment. Typical of these is the migration of xenon and krypton against a helium
atmosphere in the graphite. . However, we shall not work out the problem in detail, nor shall we
even write down the flux expressions; instead, we confine ourselves only to a discussion of the
flow parameters.

We begin this section by once more emphasizing that if all but one e of the components of a
gas mixture are present only in trace quantities, one can safely ignore all other trace components
in describing the diffusion characteristics of any one component. For example, if we wish to
characterize the transport of trace amounts of xenon and krypton in a helium atmosphere, it is
unnecessary to consider the effect of xenon on the transport of krypton and vice versa. Our

object here, therefore, is simply to obtain values for the quantities D ix and D,. i where i

_ represents either krypton or xenon, which may be applied to the MSRE conditions. These two

parameters are sufficient to completely describe the migration of the two fission products.

We have selected Kr and Xe for present considerations because the properties of these gases

are, to a close approximation, representative of the average values for the volatile species in

the so-called light and heavy fractions of the total products formed by fission.

First, however, it is necessary for us to ‘make a few assumptions. The most obvious of these

is that all of the MSRE graphite bars do not significantly deviate from the diffusion septum with

respect to internal geometry. In other words, (e”/ q’) is about the same throughout, Further,

we shall assume that (¢’/q“) is reasonably independent of temperature, so that the only tempera-

ture dependence which is exhibited by the gas transport is due to the gases themselves, Finally,

we shall choose’ T= 936°K and p= 2. 36 atm (20 psig) as the conditions characteristic of gas
transport in the MSRE.

These coefficients for Kr and Xe diffusion are also listed in Table’ 6. The important thing to
" note is that D, and the corresponding D; differ by only about 10%; in other words, normal dif-
fusion associated with the coefficient D;, does not contribute significantly to overall trans-
port in the diffusion septum. Moreover, this septum was sectioned from the MSRE graphite in
that region where normal diffusion can reasonably be assumed to be maximal. It therefore ap-
pears quite justifiable to ignore normal diffusion effects in considering gas transport in' MSRE

graphite.

Summary

7

In the experimental section of this report our primary concern was the determination of the

parameters D, , B,, and D , (or €/q") for a given septum. We have demonstrated that the
former two coefficients can be evaluated on the basis of the pressure dependence of the per-
meability coefficient, whereas D, , is conveniently determined from diffusion experiments which
are performed under conditions of constant total pressure.

The importance of these parameters lies in the fact that they specify completely the char-
acteristics of the medium geometry; once evaluated, these quantities may then be manipulated
so as to describe gas transport under a variety of conditions. In other words, additional experi-
ments need not be performed if gases other than those employed in the “calibration’’ of the
medium are of interest, or if the pressure and/or temperature conditions are varied.

Perhaps the most significant feature with regard to MSRE application is that the Knudsen
mechanism predominates in describing gaseous diffusion through this type of graphite. This
finding provides a most welcome simplification to analyses of fission product migration.

Although the data presented here for the MSRE graphite may be employed to obtain rough
estimates of its gas transport characteristics, we wish to caution the reader of the possibility °
that the sample used in this work may or may not be typical of all of the MSRE material. Our
specimen was machined from Bar # 23 [ORNL lot # 1, NCC lot # 12 (of 14)]. Provided the fab-
rication of this bar has been reasonably duplicated in the manufacture of the remainder of the
material, the flow parameters may be adopted with a fair degree of confidence. Otherwise, how-
ever, the results presented here can be least typical of MSRE graphites.

In conclusion, we also wish to emphasize that impregnation treatments frequently impart
nonhomogeneity in the structure of the finished graphite material. This can lead to rather dif-
ferent results regarding fission product transport and retention, particularly since radioactive

"decay must be taken into account. We shall consider this problem for the case of MSRE graphites

in a later report.
