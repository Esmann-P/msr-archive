SUBJECT: Thorium Breeder Reactor Evaluation. Part I. Fuel Yields and
Fuel Cycle Costs of a Two-Region, Molten Salt Breeder Reactor

TO: Distribution
FROM:  W. L. Carter end L. G. Alexander

ABSTRACT

The MSER (1000 Mwe station) is capsble of giving fuel yields of about T%/yr
(doubling time = 1k years) st & fuel cycle cost of approximately 1.5 mills/kvhr.
At fuel yields of 1 to 29/yr (DT = 100 to 50 years), the fuel cycle cost extrap-
olates to 0.65 mills/kwhr; at 44/yr (DT = 25 years), the fuel cycle cost is about

= 0.85 mills/kwhr, All systems were optimized with respect to fuel cycle proc-
Cw essing times. : SEER

ox, The effects on breeding performance of uncertainties in the epithermal value
/ : of 1-233, uncerteinty in velue of the resonance integral of Pa-233, variable

thorium inventory in fertile streem and inclusion of ZrF. in reactor fuel were
evaluated. These effects may be summarized as follows:

1. A 10% variation in the epithermsl value of 7-233 from "recommended"
_ value causes a 32.5 to 3%/yr variation in fuel yield but only a 0.06 mills/kwhr
veriation in fuel cycle cost. :

2. Using 900 barns instead of 1200 barns for Pa-233 resonsnce integral has:
only & small effect on breeding performance; the lower value increases fuel yield
ebout 0.25%/yr and lowers fuel cycle cost ebout 0.01 mills/kvhr.

3. Doubling the thorium inventory adds about 1.9%/yr to fuel yield and
0.2 mills/kwhr to fuel cycle cost. :

k, Five mole % ZrFq in LiF-BeFp-UF4 fuel salt decreases fuel yield about
'0.5#/yr, but fuel cycle cost is negligibly affected.

A trro-region, molten salt breeder reactor (esER) having core dimensions epproxie .

mately TT ft dleameter by 1 ft high and surrounded on “the ends end &ldes by. & 3-ft-
thick blanket was studied for determination of its breeding performance end fuel cycle
cost. The core composition wag approximately 16 vol % fuel -bearing salt, 6.7 vol %
fertile stream and T7.3 vol Pl graphite; side blanket ‘composition was 90 val % fertile
stream end’ 10 val % graphite, Basic criteria of the study were ‘that the reactor com=-
plex be capable of producing pover at & rate of 1000 Myre and that chemical processing
be carried out on site. Two reactors were required, Producing stean at 1800 psie and,
1050°F.

. The fuel ‘salt passed through the core and upper end blenket in ‘some 90 two-pass,
bayonet tubes made of impermesble ‘graphite which are inserted in openings in the
graphite ‘moderator, The region between the core and reactor vessel and the anmili
between the fuel tubes ‘and moderator are filled with fertile material. To minimize
inventory the fuel. stream pump and heat exchanger. are mounted directly above the

reactor core. a oo .

The fuel salt was a 63-37 mole . 4 mixture of LiF-BeFa containing at equilibrium
ebout 25 gm U per kg salt, of which ebout 18 gm was U-233 and the remainder was higher
isotopes. The fertile salt vas a 67-18-15 mole % mixture of LiF-BeFo-ThFy. At equi-
librium the fertile stream conteined from T70 to 24:00 gm U=233 plus U-235 per tonne
salt. The fuel salt was processed for fission product removed by the fluoride vola-
tility process and the HF dissolution process. A portion of the fuel salt was die=-

carded during each processing cycle for removal of fission products not removed by

HF dissolution. The fertile stream wae processed by fluoride volatility only;
fission product accumlsation in the fertile stream was maintained at a tolerable
level by discarding the fertile salt inventory on & 20-year cycle. In this reactor
only 1.3 = 6.6% of the fissions occurred in the fertile stream.

Nuclear calculations were performed using the 3k-group, multiregion GNU progremd
for the IBM-TO4 and the Cornpone program’ for the ORACLE. After attaining criticality
in these calculations, further computations were made using the ERC-5 program0 for

the IEM-TO4 to determine the equilibrium condition. It is the equilibrium results

~ that are veporied here.

The MSER is capeble of breeding over a wide renge: ‘of operating conditions
giving fuel yields” as high as about T#/yeex for a doubling time of ebout 11. 5
full~power years. At this high yield, however, & premium fuel cycle cost of ep-
proximately 1.5 mills/kwhr is incurred principally beceuse of high fuel stream
processing ‘charges. The fuel cycle cost vas optimized by determining for each
fuel yield the most economic combination of fuel stream processing cycle time and
fuel salt discard cycle time. The fuel yleld vas made to vary by assuming several
valueé of the fuel stream poison fraction end the fertile stream cycle time.

“In the realm of more economicel operation, fuel cycle costs as low as 0.65

 mills/kvhr ere predicted et fuel yields of 1 to 2%/year. ‘When the fuel yield is

Lg/year, the fuel cycle cost is approximately 0.85 mills/kwhr. ‘At this latter
condition, - “the income from sale of fertile materiel Just c offsets the snmiel ine
ventory charge. : Te : : Co
Calculations for -e representative set of operating conditions were made to
evaluate ‘MSER performance in the 1ight of uncertainties in nuclear data (value of
1-233 and the resonance integral of Pa-233), variable thorium inventory end ed-
dition of ZrF4 ac & stabilizing agent for the reactor fuel. Ete values at epi-
thermal energies within 10% of the values recommended for this study were employed
in nuclear calculations giving & $2.5 to #3%/year variation in fubl yield; corre-
sponding fuel cycle costs were negligibly affected (%0.06 mi11s/kvhr). Reactor
performance using & resonance integral of 1200 barns for Pa-233, used for this
study, was compared with that for a 900-barn value; fuel yield was improved ebout
0.25%/year with & negligible lowering of the fuel cycle cost. A lower thorium
inventory (140 tonnes vs 270 tonnes) decreased the fuel yield about 2%/yeer with

- & corresponding decrease of 0.2 mills/kvhr in fuel cycle cost. A representative

calculation in which 5'mole % ZrF¢ was added to the fuel salt indicated that the
fuel yield would be lowered by ebout 0.5%/year and that the fuel cycle cost would
be negligibly affected as ‘compared to & similar case containing no zirconium.

11.0 INTRODUCTION

-The work on the Molten galt Breeder Reactor (5) reported in this memo-
rendum is a portion of ‘a more complete study on thermal breeder reactors, which
includes the Aqueous Homogeneous Breeder Reactor (AHBR), the Liquid Bismith oe
Breeder Reactor (LBER), the Gas-Cooled Graphite-Moderated Breeder Reactor (GGER),
‘and the Deuterium-Moderated Gas-Cooled Breeder Reactor (DGER). The important
results of the complete study on all five reactors is reported in ORNL CF-61-3-9 oo
by Alexsnder™ et al; it is the purpose of this memorandum to present more detailed
data and calculations on the MSER than those included in the reference memorandum.
It is advisable forthe reader to examine ORNL CF-61-3~9 in conjunction with this
memorandum in order to make & comparison of the several thermal breeders end to
obtain information on the MSER that may not be repeated herein.

The MSER was examined with the viewpoint of obtaining a relationship between

breeding potential and economic performance. Breeding potential is related directly

to neutron economy and is therefore associated with the composition and design of
the reactor. Economic performance is determined by the annual charge on such
items as the capital investment in the reactor installation, capital investment.
in chemical processing plants, operation of these plants, inventory of valueble
materials (e.g., uranium, thorium, fuel carrier salt and fertile carrier salt),
use of these materials, end waste disposal. On the other hand, income from bred,
fissionable material in excess of that required to refuel the reactor is credited
to the economic performance. Two of the ebove charges have not been included in
this cost enalysis because no reliable cost data are available; these are the
capitel investment in the reactor installation and waste disposal charges. In
defense of omitting waste disposal charges, it might be said that since ell
wastes ere solids the disposal charges will be & very emall fraction of the

total charges. It is observed that the remaining charges are concerned with the
reactor fuel cycle and henceforth are referred to as fuel cycle costs.

In order to make a breeding system of the MSBR, it is necessary to exercise
control over those neutron poisons that are ameneble to control; some poisons,
such as reactor structursl materials, are fixed by design requirements. A |
significant advantege in neutron economy is realized by controlling poisoning
from fission products by chemically processing fuel and fertile streams for

oO
 

ww

wl}

their removal. It is epparent that the system in equilibrium may be operated
et any desired poison level ‘between thet corresponding to some practical minimm
end that of complete burnout of fission products. It is customary to identify
fission product poison level in & reactor as the poison fraction, which is de-
£ined as the ratio of neutrons absorbed in fission products to neutrons ab-
sorbed in fuel.

There is en inverse relstionship of poison fraction to breeding and" economic
performance. In order to maintain high breeding performance, ,. it is necessary to

chemically process fuel and fertile sireams on a relatively frequent schedule at

the expense of high fuel cycle cost. On the other hend, less frequent processing
Lovers the fuel cycle costs but has an adverse effect on breeding performance.
The fuel cycle cost associated with each poison fraction can be optimized by the
proper choice of fuel stream cycle time and fuel salt discard time. (See Section
2.3 for a discussion ‘of the chemical processing system.) In this study ‘ell fuel

cycle costs have been optimized with respect to fuel stream processing conditions

but not with respect to fertile stream processing conditions. The fertile stream
conditions were included as & parameter study 4n which e series of fertile stream
cycle times in the range 35-200 days vere studied for each value of fuel stream
poison fraction in the ‘range 0.011 - 0.065. The pertinent results are exhibited
as plots of fuel cycle cost (mi1e/iotr) versus fuel yield (#/yeer) and poison
fraction.

2.0 DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM ~~

2.1 Poysical Systen oe oo

The molten salt breeder reactor examined in this study is based upon the
design of MacPherson nt3 and is pictured schematically in Fig. 2.1. The reactor
is cylindrical with & core 7.66 ft in diameter and 7.66 £t high. The core is
surrounded on the ‘sides. and ‘ends by a 3-ft-thick blanket. A 1-ft-thick graphite
reflector surrounds the blenket. on the sides ‘and the ends. The reactor » heat
exchanger end circulating pump are arranged in a compact, vertical configuration
to minimize the fuel volume. Surge volume for the system is > provided in the
chamber housing the pump impeller. 5

Reactor Core. The reactor core is made entirely ¢ of graphite formed by
assembling 8=in. square prisms. The corners of adjacent prisms are machined to
form verticel passages of circular cross section gbout 5 in. in diameter. The
fuel salt passes through the core in tubes of bayonet construction which are
inserted into these machined vertical passages; the fuel tubes are made of im=~
permeable graphite. The outer tubes (see Fig. 2.1) have inside diameters of
3.75 in. and walls 0.75 in. thick. They are joined to an INOR-8 metsl header
by means of flanges, frozen-plug seals, brezing, or transition welds. . These ..
Joints are presumed to be substentially leakproof. The inner tubes have inside
diameters of 2.4 in, and walls 0.25 in. thick. They are joined to the inner
plenum of the metal header by slip Joints; these Joints need not be leakproof
since some bypass leekage at this roint cen be tolerated. The reactor contains

approximately 90 bayonet tubes. oo
Sufficient clearance between the fuel tubes and graphite moderator is
provided to allow for differential expansion between the moderator and the
metallic fuel plenum. Fuel selt enters at 1125°F, passes down through the
ennulue in the bayonet tube, rises through the inner tube at 20 ft/sec, and
exits at 1300°F. It is collected in the plenum and passes up through a duct
to the impeller of the pump from which it is forced through the tubes of the
heat exchenger. After leaving the heat exchanger, the cycle for the salt is
repeated. The salt circulates at approximately 50,000 gpm, removing 1070 Mv

of heat. The heat exchanger contains approximately 8100 tubes (INOR-8) vhich —

are 0.375 in. in outside diameter and have 0.028 in. walls. The shell side of &
the heat exchanger contains molten sodium. |

Reactor Blanket. The major portion of the fertile salt circulates through
the side and end ‘blenkets; however, a small portion bypasses through the core

in the passages between the fuel tubes and the graphite moderator. In its

\

passage through the reactor the fertile salt temperature rises from 1150°F to
1300°F; this sensible heat 1s then removed in & sodium-cooled heat exchanger.
The salt circulates at epproximately 3900 gpm end removes about 112 Mw of heat.
This is about 10% of the total reactor energy; however, only sbout 1.3 - 6.6% of
the reactor energy originates from fisslons in the fertile stream. The heat
exchanger contains epproximately 1000 tubes (xog-8) which are 0.375 in. in

- diameter and have O. 028 in. valls.

Reactor Composition. The approximate volumetric composition of the reactor

core is as follows: 16% fuel stream, 6.7% fertile stream, and T7-3% graphite.

The volumetric composition of the side blanket is 90% fertile stream and 10%

graphite. ~ The top end blanket contains both fuel and fertile stream; the volu-

metric composition is 16% fuel stream, Ti% fertile stream, and 10% graphite.
Additional date on the reactor and heat removal system are given in

Table 2.1.

2.2 Selt Composition
The fuel salt consists of a mixture of 63 mole % LiF end 37 mole $ BeF,

containing sufficient UF), (equilibrium mixture of uranium isotopes) to make “the

system critical - sbout 0. 35 mole %.

The fertile stream has a basic composition of 67-18-15 mole % LiF-BeF,-ThF), .

The equilibrium mixture of course contains Pa-233 » uranium isotopes and a small
concentration of fission products. The uranium content of the fertile stream is
naintained at a quite low level by the efficient fluoride volatility processing
method (see below); therefore, it is not extremely important that the fertile-
stream volume be kept low. In fact, in some cases it 1e desirable to have a

large excess fertile-stream volume to decrease ‘neutron losses by protactinium

capture through the dilution effect.
The distribution of fuel- and fertile-strean volumes inside and outside the

SER 1s tebulated in Teble 2.2.

2.3 Chemical Reprocessing Systen

: A flow diegram of the chemical reprocessing systen is shown in Fig. 2.2.
The processing operation consists of three parts: fuel salt purificetion,
uranium recovery from the fertile stream, end helium sperging to remove fission
geses from the fuel salt.

Fuel Selt Purification. The fuel salt is purified in the fluoride volatility-
HF dissolution process “by pumping a side-stream of the circulating molten salt
through the processing plent in & specified cycle time. The cycle time is &
function of the poison fraction. at which the Feactor is permitted to operate,
vhich in this investigation is a perameter. Co

The first step in purification is to fluorinate the molten salt with ele-
mental fluorine to volatilize UF. This uranium hexafluoride is then burned in
hydrogen to produce UF), which is recycled to the reactor after dissolution in
the recovered ‘carrier salt. Ureniun-free salt, containing fission products,
flows from the fluorinator to the HF dissolution step. Here a separation is
made between the salt and the bulk of the fission products. The carrier salt
is dissolved 1n a 90% HF-10% H0 solution leaving fission products, principally
rare earths, as insoluble material. The carrier salt is recrystallized, fortified
vith recovered UF), end recycled to the reactor. In order to purge those fission
products which are not removed in the HF dissolution step, portions of the fuel
salt are periodically removed end fresh make=up selt is added. The fission
products purged in this manner include mainly the alkali metals and elkaline
earths such. as Cs, Ro, sr, Ba, Te, Se, Nb, Cd, Ag, Tc, ete.

The fuel salt replacement cycle time depends upon the fuel stream cycle
time end the ‘poison fraction. It is possible to achieve &’ ‘Epecified poison
fraction with several ‘combinations of fuel stream cycle time end fuel salt re-
placement cycle time as is shown in Figs. 5.1 and 5. 2. The proper replacement
cycle is determined by optimizing the fuel cycle’ cost with respect to several
eorbinations ‘of the two cycle times. To

Fertile Stream Processing. The fertile stream is processed in the fluoride

‘volatility step only. The salt is circulated at a specified rate through &
fluorinator where contact with fluorine gas volatilizes UFg. The salt then
returns directly to the blanket without additional treatment. The UFg from the

fluorinator is reduced with H, to UF, which is blended vith UF, recovered from

the fuel salt for recycle to the reactor. Excess production is sold.

In the MSER at fertile stream cycle times less than 100 deys such & small
fraction of fissions (<6.6%) occurs in the fertile stream that it is not neces-
sery to purify the salt in e HF dissolution step. The fission-product build-up

is slow enough that their level can be conveniently controlled by replacing the

salt on & relatively long cycle. A 20-year cycle has been specified in this
study.
It will be observed thet protactintun is not removed. from the. fertile salt
in this process. FProtactinium builds up in the salt until its decay rate is
Just equal to the U-233 production. rete, The effect of Pa~233 on the neutron

~ economy is controlled by edjusting the volume of the fertile stream, Larger

volumes giving fewer neutron losses to protactinium,

Fission Gas Removal. Fission gases are removed from the fuel and fertile
streams by sparging with helium. Xenon, krypton end the halogens are expected
to be removed in this way, The off-gas ie passed through charcoal beds where
the fission gases are ebsorbed. Helium is recovered for reuse.

2.4 Power Generation Cycle :

The steam cycle of the TVA John Sevier } pover plant vas used es & model for
the MSER concept» 15 Steam conditions ere taken as 1800 psia end 1050°F; the

3.0 DESIGN BASES AND COMPUTATIONAL METHODS

3.1 - Plant Sige

Based on a study by Robertson,> it was sssumed thet future power stations
in the United States would have a capacity of the order of 1000 Mwe. Consequently,
' this size was chosen for this study. Also it was assumed thet anyone ‘building a
plant of this size would be unwilling to install the entire Toad in a single re-
actor; therefore, at least two reactors are specified for each station. oo

3.2 On-Site Processing. |

On-site chemical reprocessing was chosen for the station. This method lends
itself to better control and definition of in-process inventory. _Reasonebly ~
relisble cost estimates are available on fluoride volatility plants for proc-

essing core and fertile streams.

3.3 Operating Conditions

All calculations vere made for continuous 3 steady-state operation of the a
reactor complex. To avoid complicated calculations of startup and shutdown, it
was assumed’ that the reactors would be contimously fueled end processed, and Cw

that the operation had been going on sufficiently long for all fission products
and heavy isotopes to be in equilibrium. ’

3.4 Product Composition

The product composition may vary between the limits of almost pure U-233 to
spent fuel.- However, in a meny-reactor system complex, the fuel yleld (or doubling
time) is unambiguously defined only when the product has the same composition as
the average composition of the entire system; i.e., reactor plus chemical proc-
essing systems. Celculeted portions of the recovered spent fuel and of the bred
material are removed as product at the UF g-UF), reduction step. The product is
an equilibrium mixture of uranium isotopes; viz., U-233, U-234, U=-235, and U-236.

»

3.5 System Inventory

In order to be consistent and unambiguous in the definition of fuel yield,
the inventory should include all fissioneble and potentially fissionsble atoms
(U-233, U-235, and Pa-233) in the entire system. Included in the inventory is
any fuel that is reserved to allow reactor operation during shutdown of the
chemical processing plant. In this study a 30-day fuel reserve was chosen.

3.6 Neutron losses

Fisston-product poisoning’ in ‘this reactor was based on a study by Burch,
Campbell, and Weeren, 3 vho made a study of the cumlative effect of 4h isotopes
divided into four groups. This phenomenon is discussed more completely in
Section 5.0. ew

Xenon Poisoning. It was assumed thet xenon could be continuously removed
from the circulating fuel by gas ‘sparging end maintained et a level such that
the neutron loss to xenon is 0 -005 neutrons per fuel sbsorption. Since there
are so few fissions (<6. 6%) in the fertile stream of the MSER, ell xenon losses
were aselgned to the fuel ‘stream. Lo

- In choosing & value for xenon losses, it was assumed that (a) neither xenon
nor iodine is ebsorbed by the graphite moderator or otherwise collects at the
interface between salt and graphite phases; or (b) if the pores and vacancies
in the graphite are accessible to xenon and iodine, the rates at which they
diffuse into the pores are very much slower then the rates at which hey ere
stripped from the circulating stream by the sparge ges.

Other Fission Product ‘Poisoning. Concerning ‘the effect of the uy fission-
product isotopes studied by Campbell, Burch, en and Weeren,’ four groups vere dis-
cerned and treated separately. The first comprised noble metals vhich vere
assumed to plate out on the cold zones of the eirculeting system; the second
comprised halogens which vere assumed to volatilize during the fluorination
step. A third group ‘which 1s soluble in HF end therefore ‘not removed in the
dissolution step comprised the alkali metals (notably Rb and Cs ), ‘the ‘elkeline
earths (Sr, Ba, etc.) and a miscellaneous group (Te, Se, Ib, ca, Ag; Tc, ete.).
This soluble group. is removed by replacement of the fuel salt on some specified
cycle. ‘The final group is the rare earths vhich are removed by precipitation .

during the hii diseolution step. ~The poison fraction is thus not a simple function

of the ‘processing rate and is computed as described in Section 5.0 below.

Fission products in the fertile stream ere controlled entirely by the
20-year throwaway cycle of the thorium carrier since this stream is not chemi -
cally Processed for fission product removal.
 

Fuel Processing Losses. Fuel processing losses are based upon laboratory
end pilot plant data, which have indicated essentially quantitative removal of
uranium from the salt by the fluoride volatility. process. Consequently, losses
that occur. will be almost ‘entirely in the UFg-> UF), reduction step. It is be-
lieved thet on large-scale operation these losses can be made quite small =e=
of the order of O. 01% of throughput.

Carrier and Moderator Losses. Neutron losses to the carrier salts are
based upon the use of a feed salt in which the lithium component is present as
99.99 at. %. Lil and 0.01 at. 4 148. A salt having a lover 118 concentration
would be desirable; however, it is questionable whether or not the Premium price
for such a salt is justified by the increased neutron economy.

In this ‘study the mono-energetic capture cross section of graphite was teken

to be 4.2 mb at 0. 025. ev and was assumed to vary inversely with the velocity of

the neutrons.
3.7 Nuclear Date

Nuclear cross sections for this study were compiled by Nestor." Following

the recommendations of Fluherty and Evens ,? a value of 2.28 was assigned to ete

of U-233 et thernal energies. The resonance integral of Pa-233 was assumed to
be 1200 barns. Allowance for resonance saturation (self-shielding) vas made
only in the case of thorium, end here Doppler broadening was also taken into
account. Epithermal cross sections of other isotopes of interest were adjusted
to agree with the resonance integrals tabulated by Stoughton and Halperin.

The composite 2200-meter cross section of fission products (exclusive of Xe,
Sm-151, end Sn-149) wes teken as 50 barns per fission and assigned to an
artificial ‘element celled "fissium." A resonance integral of 170 barns per
fission was assigned to fissium as suggested by the work of Nephew.! However,
in the computation of poison fraction, resonance integrals had to be assigned

to each individual fission product. Available values were teken from ‘Nephew; Co

1f no value was reported, it was calculated from aveileble data.

Fuel Carrier and Blanket Carrier Cross Sections. The fuel carrier, which
is composed of a ‘mixture of 147, 11°, Be, and F atoms, is treated as & single,
pseudo fuel-salt atom in the nuclear calculations. It is convenient to do this

because the GNU code is limited in the number of elements for which absorptions

o

<)
 

a)

I]

ul)

-23

can be calculated; consequently, lumping these elements saved space on the tape
for needed calculations. A pseudo crose section for the fuel salt was obtained
by normalizing the cross section to the basis of one atom of 117 and summing the
results. In the normalization the cross section of each atom was multiplied by
the atomic ratio of that particular atom to al. The atomic concentration of -
the salt is then expressed as the atomic concentration of 117 in the salt. The
lithium component of the salt was assumed to ‘be 99. 99 at. 9 11’,

The fertile-stream carrier was treated in a similar manner with the cross
sections of each component etom normalized to the basis of an atom of thorium.
The fertile-stream carrier contains 117, 145, Be, F, end Th atoms. The atomic
concentration of the carrier is then expressed es the atomic concentration of
thorium in the salt. The 117 purity is the same as ‘used in the fuel carrier.

3 8 Nuclear Calculations

Kuclear calculations on the MSER vere performed using two different reactor
codes: the 3h-group GNU coded for the IEM-T04 and the Cornpone coded for the
ORACLE. The use of the two codes expedited the calculations. The reactor was
first treated in sphericel geometry es & homogenized system using GNU, and a
criticality search was made to determine the critical concentration of thorium
and protactinium in the core. The diameter of the equivalent sphere vas taken

.&8 1,09 times the cylinder diameter. - This information. was then used in Cornpone.

calculations, also in spherical geometry, to determine the thorium concentration
in the core of the critical heterogeneous reactor. The heterogeneity of the
MSER could be studied on Cornpone through the use of "disadvantage factors"
disadvantege factors could not be applied to GNU. . Since all parameter studies
vere to be made on the equilibrium reactor, the critical reactor concentrations
from the Cornpone calculation were used &s’ input. information for en equilibrium
reactor calculation using the ERC-5 cotel® for the. IEM-TOk. This calculation :
determined the concentrations end elemental Rewtron ebeorptions in the critical,
equilibrium reactor.

A more detailed ‘scuesion of the nuclear calculations appears in Section 3. 2
of Ref. 1. :

The aisedventege factors mentioned above 3 vere used to relate the concen~
trations of the homogenized reactor to those of the heterogeneous reactor. These

factors were determined in a lattice-cell calculation by means of the Cornpone

3.9 Costs of Materials and Facilities and Interest Charges

The basic cost data ‘employed in this study to calculate fuel eyele costs
ere given in Table 3.1. These data are believed to be representative of the
costs of MSER materiels and emortization charges.

Fuel Stream Processing. The cepitel cost of the fuel stream processing
Plent ves based upon & cost study by Weinrich,lt who estimated the capital
charges for a plant to process continuously about 20 £t3/day of fuel salt. A
plent of this capacity is within the region of interest of this study. Weinrich's
date were reviewed by Chemical Technology Division personnel” ‘for comparison with
more recent cost date and cost estimating practices at Oak Ridge National Labora=-
tory and, as e result, his date were adjusted upward. These data and the ORNL
revised figures are presented in Teble 3.2. The ORNL estimate is ‘approximately
tvice that of Weinrich. These estimates were made from functional flowsheets
representing the best aveilable design information on the fluoride volatility
and HF dissolution processes.

In optimizing MSER systems to obtain the most economic combination of
fuel processing plant cost end fuel salt replacement cost, it vas necessary
to extrapolate the ORNL cost estimate in Teble 3.2 to both smaller and larger

There is a limit, however, to the extrapolation in the region of low proc-
essing rates because at some low rate, vhich may not be well defined, it is
economic to change from continuous to batch processing methods. In this study
it was assumed that the lower limit of continuous ‘processing would occur around
T £t3/any, vhich corresponds to e fuel cycle time of T5 days. (The fuel stream
volume was constant at 530 £t3. ) When the fuel cycle time is 75 days, the ex-
trepoleted cost curve (Fig. 3.1) indicates that the cepitel investment is ebout

$5 million. Furthermore, it was felt that the investment in & batch plant would
not be sensitive to further increases in the cycle time; consequently, the $5
million value was assumed to apply to all plants having cycle times greater than
T5 days. A batch processing plant was estimated by Weinrich to cost $3.4 million;
the ebove figure allows & premium of $1.6 million over Weinrich's estimate.

Fertile Stream Processing. The fertile streem is processed only in a
fluoride volatility step and, therefore, requires imch less equipment than the
accompanying fuel stream processing plant. Weinricht included the fertile
stream plant as an integral part of his fuel stream plant design end did not
make a complete separate breakdown of the two costs. However, it was possible
to prepare a cost estimate for the fertile stream plent by extracting specific
items from Weinrich's estimate and including ellocations for instruments, build-
ings, etc. ORNL pricing procedures were applied to prepare the estimate given
in Teble 3.3.

This tabulation presents velues that are applicable to a plant processing
fertile stream at & rate of 20 £3 /aay, the same basis upon which the fuel
stream processing plant was designed. For this rate it was estimated that the
capitel investment would be ebout $1.8 million dollars. These values were plotted
in Fig. 3.2; the remainder of the graph was obtained by assuming the cost was
proportional to the 0.6 power of the processing rate. ‘

4.0 REACTOR CALCULATIONS

ba Reactor Size

For engineering reasons 1b vas decided that the MSER would be ea cylinder
having a height equal to the diameter.

Core Size. In determining the core size of the MSER 1t was necessery to
fix certain reactor properties. In this study the thermal power, fuel stream
velocity in the core, and the temperature rise of the fuel in its passage through
the core vere arbitrarily chosen. The ‘diameter of the core is related to these
quentities by Eq. 2.

When the appropriate numbers are substituted in this equation, a core

eter was ‘one-half of the. total core power for the. station, giving two reactors
for the instellation. This agrees with the decision that the total station:
load would not be committed to a: single reactor. Co

Flenket Thickness. The cylindrical core of the MSER is surrounded by a -
blanket on the sides and on each end. Based on previous studies, 13 the thickness
of the blanket was fixed at 3 £% on both ends ‘and on the side. This thickness vag

sufficient to reduce neutron leakage to & tolersble level. As given in Table 2d, :

the side blanket is 90 vol % fertile stream and 10 vol ¢ graphite.

Refléctor Thickness. ‘The reflector vas chosen to bee  1-ft=thick block of
graphite ‘surrounding the side and end blankets. The over-all reactor dimensions s
excluding the reflector, ere 13.66 ft diemeter by 13.66 ft high.

h.2 GNU Calculations

The calculations for the MSER were made as indicated in the flow diegram of
Fig. 4.1. The basic nuclear calculations were performed on the miltiregion, one-

dimensional, 34-group GNU progremnd for the IBM-TOk. The equilateral » cylindrical :

reactor was treated as an equivelent sphere having e ‘diameter 9% greater than the
cylinder; the 34% groups of cross sections consisted of 32 fast groups, an epi-
thermal group for the energy range 5.5 kT-0.6 ev, ‘and a thermal group.

Input De Date. Input deta for a consisted of specifications of reactor
geometry, dimensions y &nd the homogenized atomic densities of the several ele-
“ments in the system. The concentration of each element was homogenized over the
region in vhich it appeared. Since a small fraction of the fertile stream passes
through the core of the MSER, the core concentrations included the sum of fuel
. stream and that portion of the fertile stream concentrations. The initial values
of fuel, moderator, and fission product concentrations used in the GNU calcu-
letions were based upon concentrations previously developed for the experimental
ges-cooled reactor (EGCR) and from previous molten salt reactor studies. The
elements considered in these calculations are given in Table kl.

Output Date. The GNU program provides e criticality search by vhich either
a dimension or one © or more concentrations are varied until the miltiplication
constant differs from unity by less then some small specified amount. In these
calculations the reactor was made critical by varylng the concentrations of

protactinium and thorium in the core. Since the thorium density in the fertile~

stream carrier 1s fixed by the selt composition, this ls equivalent to varying
the volume fraction of fertile stream in the core. Additional useful output

date were the fractions of neutrons involved in sbsorption and fission reactions

for each nuclear species in each region of the reactor.

4.3 Cornpone Unit Cell Celewlation

The second step in the nuclear calculations was to determine the atomic
concentrations of the heterogeneous reactor. (The GNU program could treat only
a homogenized system.) The core of the MSER was visualized as being composed
of & number of cylindrical, unit cells like the one diagrammed in Fig. 4.2. The
unit cell contained six regions (see Fig. 2.1): inner fuel zone ’ graphite tube,
annular fuel zone, graphite tube, fertile stream passage, » and graphite moderator.

The cell was examined using the Cornpone code’ for the ORACLE to develop a set of
34=-group disadvantage factors for each region of the unit cell, These disadvantage.
factors, defined in Section 3. 8, vere then used in subsequent Cornpone calculations
to determine ‘the concentrations for the critical, ’ heterogeneous reactor.

The Cornpone code treated the unit cell as an infinite cylinder having zero
net current at the outer boundary. Input information for the calculation was
the streem concentration in each region and the thickness of each region. The
stream concentrations used vere those developed in the preliminary GNU celeu-
lation. In eddition to the disadvantage factors, the ‘code calculated ‘the mlti-
plication constant of the cell.

kh Cornpone Finite Reactor Calculation

The disadvantage factors were used in a finite reactor -calculation using
the Cornpone program to determine the critical concentrations of the heterogeneous
reactor. As in the GNU calculation the reactor vas calculated in equivalent
spherical geometry.

Input Data. The calculations were made on & 3-region model - core, blenket, \
end reflector. The concentration of each nuclear species, vhich were obtained :
from the GNU calculation, was homogenized over a region according to its volume
fraction in the region. The set (or sets) of disadvantage factors to be used
with each concentration was specified as well as the dimensions of the region.

The machine calculation multiplies each homogenized concentration by the appro-
priate disadvantage facter so that all properties that are dependent on the atomic
density of that element are veighted by the relative flux to which the muclei are
exposed. The concentrations are thus “disadvantaged” to reflect the heterogeneity
of the system. For example, the absorptions in the i-th element in the j-th stream
in the k-th region is computed by the double summation

where g, (tu) is the group-mean flux in the homogenized increment of volume

AV. D, ,3,k is the disadvantage factor, K 1,3,k is the homogenized atomic con-
s J

centration, end O 7 (au) is the absorption cross section.

It should be pointed out that disadvantage factors were applied only to
element events (absorptions and fisslons) occurring in the core. In the blenket
and reflector, element events were calculated as though the disadvantage factors
were unity for all lethargy groups.

Output Data. The Cornpone program determines the fractions of absorptions
and fissions of each atomic species in each region and the multiplication con-
stent of the reactor. The code does ‘not meke a "search" on eny of the input
information; hence it 1s necessary to rerun the problem vith adjusted input if
the miltiplication constant differs from unity by more than a prescribed small
amount. In these calculetions criticality was achieved by varying the thorium.

concentration in the core.

Reaction Rate Coefficients. Element absorptions in each region of the
reactor were used to compute sets of reaction rates coefficlents, Cy 3 x? Vaich

The coefficiénts are properly disadvantaged’ through the use of Dy 4.x 3,k
reflect the heterogeneity of the system. These integrals have the useful property
that, when maltiplied by the stream atomic concentration and the volume fraction
af the stream in the considered region, ‘they give the fraction of neutrons in-
volved in absorption interactions with the i-th element in the J-th stream in
the k-th region. Furthermore, if this fraction is miltiplied by the totel number
of neutrons ‘born per unit time in the reactor, ‘the product is the absorption rate
by element 1 in stream J in region k. This letter quantity is very useful in
caleuleting the equilibrium state of the reactor as discussed below.

In e calculetion eimiler to thet described by Eg. k, sete of fission rate
coefficients were developed for elements that hed & fission cross section. These
fission coefficients were used in an entirely analogous manner to the sbsorption
coefficients to describe element fission events in the streams and regions of the

reactor. : All comments about the use of ‘the ebsorption coefficients apply to the

fiesion coefficient.
4.5 Equilibrium Reactor Celeulstions (ERC-3)

Equilibrium Reactor Calculations vere next performed on ‘the critical Cornpone
reactor by means of the ERC~5 coder? for the IEM-TO4. This program integrated
the reactor with the fuel and fertile stream chemical processing systems and com-

puted pertinent equilibrium properties of the system.

Inpu t Data. The equilibrium calculations required the following input in-
formation: fuel and fertile stream volumes, volume fractions, process cycle
times, process holdup times, and critical concentrations; reactor power, poison
fraction override, fuel reserve time, and recovery efficiencies associated with

fuel end fertile stream processing. The ERC-5 code solved a system of equations

based upon conservation of mass, criticality, and conservation of neutrons; these
equations used the sbsorption and fission reaction rete coefficients calculated
from the Cornpone data. All neutrons were accounted for, including those absorbed
in fertile materials, moderator, carriers, etc., and those leaking out of the

‘blanket or lost as delayed neutrons.
 

- ko -

Output Data. -The program celculates the ‘equilibrium stream concentrations.
and neutron ebsorptions in both fuel and fertile streams for the elements listed

in Teble 4.1. Also the inventories and mass processing rates are computed for

all uranium isotopes, thorium and protactinium, Since the sales philosophy is

to sell & product that hes the same composition as the system mixture, the
fractions of recovered fuel and fertile streams that are directed to sales are
calculated. Additional values calculated by ERC=-5 code are the fraction of
fissions in the fertile stream and the inventory of fissionsble material reserved
for a possible 30-day shutdown of the processing facilities.

The program offers the option of atteining criticality by adjusting the U-233
and U-235 concentrations in the fuel stream or by adjusting the volume fraction of
thorium in the core. In these calculations the second option was employed. Slight
adjustments in the amount of thorium in the core had & negligible effect on the

carbon-to-uranium ratio and hence on the neutron spectrum.

- In some instances it was desirable to specify the fraction of neutrons that
would be allowed for losses in xenon, fuel fission products, and leskege. This
condition could easily be treated on the ERC-5 code by specifying a fictitious
atomic concentration and absorption rate coefficient that gave the desired ab-
sorptions. Xenon and fuel stream fission products were treated this way beceuse
their amounts are controlled by predetermined processing : rates. Leakage is con-
trolled by the reflector design. oo

5.2 Solution of Polson Fraction Equation

~The total fission product potson fraction was conveniently calculated using
PF-8 and PF-9 codes for the ORACLE which solved Eq. T. Detailed knowledge of
cross sections as a function of energy for the ‘individual fission products was
not evaileble; however, reasonably relisble thermal cross sections are known.
It was necessary therefore to relate fission product absorptions to ebsorptions
in another element for which more extensive cross section data ere available.
Carbon was chosen for the reference element.

In Eq. 7 ell of the terms are , mown except the term ¢C. From previous GNU
or Cornpone celculations a reaction rate coefficient ’ Ce » for carbon can be com~
puted as the quotient of total carbon absorptions at all energies in a region
end the homogenized concentration of carbon atoms (see ‘Section 4.4). Using this

5. 3 Fission Products Included in Poison Fraction Calouletion

The fission products used in the poison fraction celculations were those
recommended by Burch, Campbell, and Weeren.3 -Forty-four nuclides that would make
en epprecieable contribution to the poisoning were chosen; these are listed in
Teble 5. 1. The isotopes of xenon are not included in this tabulation because the
poisoning from xenon (primarily Xe-135) is so large that it 1s treated separately,
end a special processing method (gas sparging) mist be employed to bring this velue
vithin tolerable limits. Hence the poison fraction calculated by Eg. 7 for the
fission products in Table 5.1 excludes any xenon contribution.

The Li fission products are divided into ‘three groups which classify the
elements more or less according to their chemical behavior in the system. The
first group contains the metals that ‘are noble relative to nickel ‘and might be
expected to be reduced and plate out on the valle of the system. Also included :
in this group ere the iodines and bromine that ere probably removeble by gas
‘sparging end hence may behave like xenon. The noble metals and the halogens are
treated as if they are removed from the fuel eolution on & very fast cycle end
thus contribute little to ‘the poison fraction. :

The ‘second group contains the rare “earths that are removed by precipitation
in the: ‘HF-dissolution process and are thereby controlled &y. the fuel stream cycle

The third group contains the alkali and elkalipe earth metals thet are soluble

ORACLE to establish the poison fractions associated. with e large number of

combinstions of fuel stream cycle time, ESE end fuel salt discard time, Tar
The initial calculations were performed considering the fission products to be

A second set of curves, Fig. 5.2, was constructed from the solutions of
Egs. T, 11, and 12 to reflect the influence of fission product resonance &b-
sorptions on the poison fraction. Resonance integrals of the individual fission

products given in Teble 5.1 were used. At the same velues of T, end T, a the

effect of including the resonance absorptions is to eppreciably increase the
Poison fraction over its value when the fission products were considered to be

cycle times the inclusion of resonance absorptions increases the polson fraction
by & factor of 2. 5- 3.

Velues along the abscissa of Fig. 5.2 have also been divided by eta in
order to express the poison fraction on & "per neutron born" basis.

Figures 5.1 and 5.2 were used in optimizing the fuel cycle cost at a chosen
poison fraction. Along & line of constant poison fraction in these figures
several compatible values of T, end T, gq vere chosen, and the total fuel cycle
cost was calculated for each pair of values, The cycle time, I influences the
fuel cycle cost through the capital investment in the processing plant; the fuel

The calculated fuel cycle costs were plotted as a function of the fuel salt dis
card cycle time, Lar (Section 6. 2.1) and the optimm cost and corresponding

6.0 PARAMETER STUDIES AND RESULTS

The equilibrium reactor was ‘studied to determine the effects of variations

in certain reactor characteristics on the nuclear performance and economics of

the system. The investigated parameters were:

1. poison fraction in fuel stream

2. fertile stream cycle time

3. fertile stream volume

hk, value of resonance integral of Pa=233

5. value of epithermal fission cross section of U=233
6. eddition of ZrF, to stebilize fuel salt

The last three items perheps are not rightly classified es peremeters since they
are not independent characteristics. However in the cases of the resonance in-
tegral end the epithermal fission cross section, the renges of uncertainty. in
measured values ere sufficiently broad to have significant effects on reactor
performance. Item 6 was introduced because recent fuel salt studies have in-
dicated a need for ZrF), to inhibit oxide precipitation of fuel atoms.

The two major parameters in this study were the fuel stream poison fraction

‘and the fertile stream cycle time. The remaining four items were examined for

variations in these two major parameters. The studies were made on the equilib-
rium state of the reactor described in Section 2.0 using the ERC=5 coae™® for
the IBM-TO4. However, in making the calculations for several values of epithermal

fission cross sections of U-233 (Item 5), it vas necessary to establish new

critical conditions for the reactor using the GNU coded before the 'ERC-5 calecu~

lations could be made.

Reactor properties that were held constant during the parametric study
were the fuel stream volume (530.2 £t3) and station power (2364 Mwt). The
effective carbon-to-urenium ratio was calculated for each equilibrium reactor
and varied only slightly from case to case because of slightly different equi-
librium conditions. ‘The range of C:U ratios for all of the calculations was

- 5020 to 5230. These values are the actual C:U ratio divided by the thermal

energy disadventege factor (0.879) for carbon in the core. The variation from
case to case was caused by small changes in the volume fraction of fertile stream
in the core for changes in fuel stream poison fraction and fertile stream cycle
time.

a

\o/
 

In the equilibrium calculations it was assumed that the absorption and
fission rate coefficients. were not appreciably affected by small changes in con-
centrations (~ 10%) in importent elements such as U-233, U-235 and fissium, and
by much larger changes (~ 1000%) in minor elements such as U-234, Pa-233, Xe,
etc. In ceses in which the equilibrium calculations significantly changed the
concentration to the extent that the reaction rate coefficients might no longer
epply, it was necessary to repeat the Cornpone unit cell and finite reactor calcu-
lations with new concentrations to develop nev sets of reaction rate coefficients
(see: Fig. 4.1).

Several items in the neutron balence were specified for all of the parametric
studies. These were the neutron losses to corrosion products,” delayed neutrons,
leakage and fuel processing. The values adopted for these quantities were re-
spectively O. 0003, 0.0043, 0. 0, end’ o. 0022 neutrons lost per neutron absorbed
in fuel. RE

Corrosion product losses were estimated from the equilibrium concentration
of corrosion products of INOR-8. Delayed neutrons were calculated by the method
of Velker 18 Leakage losses were estimated from design considerations; it was
felt thet this number would be small becsuse of the small emount of fissioning

in the blanket. Fuel processing losses vere discussed ebove in Section 3.6.
6.1 . Results of Equilibrium Reactor Calculations

Pertinent characteristics of the MSER on  vhich equilibrium caleuletions
were made ere listed in Table 6.1.

-- Representative results of the equilibrium reactor calculations are given
in Tebles 6.2 and 6.3 in the Appendix. These results include the equilibrium
atomic’ concentrations of- major isotopes in the fuel end fertile’ streams, a
neutron balance for ‘the system, ‘the contribution of individuel items to the
fuel cycle cost, ; the’ volume fraction of fertile stream in the core for the
Just: critical reactor, and seversl items of less significance such as the’ frac-
tions of each stream sold as product end the fraction of totel fissions occurring
in the fertile stream. :

The option used to achieve criticality in the ERC-5 calculations was the
variation of the volume fraction of fertile stream in the core. Since the
volume fraction of fuel stream was fixed st 0.16, the eddition or subtraction
of fertile stream was made at the expense of removing or adding moderator.
Consequently the c:u retio in the core varied slightly from case to case. How-
ever these small variations in C:u ratio did not significantly affect the neutron
spectrum.

6.1.1 Fael Cycle Time

The fuel stream cycle times reparied in Tebles 6.2 end 6. 3 are the. optimized
cycle times. . Each time has been so chosen that it.reflects the most economic
rate for the chemical processing for the chosen values of poison fraction and.
fertile stream eyele 1 time. The fuel salt discard cycle time has also been
optimized. ’

In these two tebles the results are for reactor systems in which the fission
product resonance absorptions were included in the poison fraction celculation.
Results of celeculations in which fission products were assumed to be 1/v absorbers
are not included because these are just optimistic special cases of the resonance
ww 50 -

elisorption calculations. For the resonance absorption cases the fuel stream
cycle time and fuel salt discard times are respectively in the ranges 12-84 days
end 145-1550 days for ‘poison fractions from 0.02 = 0.065 neutrons absorbed in
fission products per neutron ebsorbed in fuel. For the 1/v sbsorption cases,
the corresponding cycle times are in the ranges 12.5-735 days and 400-8100 days
for poison fractions from 0.011 = 0.065.

The procedure for determining the optimum fuel cycle times was referred to
ebove in Section 5.7 and 1s discussed further in Section 6. 2.

6.1.2 Neutron Balence

Resonance Absorption Cases. A portion of each of Tables 6.2 end 6.3 shows
the distribution of neutron absorptions in the reactor. Examining the neutron
balance of Table 6.2 for increasing poison fraction, one finds that losses to
 protactinium fall about 10% partly because the Pa-233 concentration decreases

sbout 7% due to decreasing breeding ratio. The decrease in losses to Pa ie also
partly due to & decrease in the volume’ fraction: of fertile stream in the core by
‘ebout T%. This is significant because ebout 60% of the captures in Fa-233 occurs
in the core. A similer effect 1s observed for the tabulations of Table 6.3 for
- other fertile stream cycle times.

Concurrently neutron losses to ‘samarium and other fission products increase

by sbout 0.045 peutrons. This is more than half of the breeding gein end results
in more than one-half the production of excess fuel... The longer cycle times at
the higher poison fractions effect less purging of higher uranium isotopes . The
consequent build-up of U-235 causes a decrease in the mean 7 of the system by
ebout 0.00%. ‘Neutron losses to U-236 and Kp-237 increase’ ‘&bout 1. 5-fold end
10-fold; respectively, or by ebout 0. 006 end 0.002 neutrons. -

1/v Absorption Ceses. The neutron balences for these calculations are not
presented in this memorandum because they are of limited interest. Since ‘the
range of poison fractions (0.011 = 0.065) is greater than that covered in the
resonance ebsorption cases, more varletions might be expected in the elementel
absorptions. The explanation of the trends, however, is the same &s given ebove.
For example, ~Pa=233 absorptions decrease ebout 1k¢ over the range of poison
fractions because its concentration decreases about 7%, and the volume fraction
of fertile stream in the core decreases ebout 13%.
 

Losses to samarium and other fission products increases by 0.054% neutrons
consuming about T0% of the breeding gain. Higher isotopes of uranium build up
because of slower processing rates at the higher poison fractions with the ac-
companying decrease (~ 0.005) in the mean value of 1. Neutron absorptions by
U-236 and Np-237 increase by ebout 0.004 and 0.005. BE i

6.1.3 System Eaventory

The inventory of fissionable materials ’ vhich includes U-233, U-235, and
Pg-233, for the equilibrium reactors is presented in Fig. 6.1; a detailed break-
down of the inventory is given in Tables 6.2 - 6.3. For both resonance ebsorption
and 1/v absorption cases the inventory does not .change very fast with poison
fraction over most of the renge of poison fractions. However, at low velues of
the poison fraction a sharp upturn in the inventory is observed. This occurs
because of the increased holdup in the chemical processing plant at these fast

processing rates. The proccessing rate for the resonance absorption cases. et
8 poison fraction of 0.02 is about equal to the rate for the 1/v sbsorption cases
at a poison fraction of 0.011.

The largest effect on J— inventory is observed for the variation in -
fertile stream cycle time. As the fertile stream cycle ‘time increases from 35-200
days, the totel fissionable inventory increases about 50%, or from around 860 to

1240 kg. ‘The increase is attributed almost entirely to increase of U=-233 inventory

in the fertile stream which rises over 5-fold.. Urenium-233 inventory in the fuel
stream decreases about 6%; concurrently the U-235 inventory increases about 1%.

Increased fissioning in the blanket at the longer cycle times causes the critical .
mass of U-233 in the core to decrease. However since the breeding gain also de-

creases for increasing fertile stream cycle time at constant polson fraction, - Co
the purge rete of U-235 becomes smaller because less U=-235 is routed to sales; 3
hence the U-235 inventory in the core builds up. Coe

The thorium inventory for this series of caleulations was maintained constent
at 270 tonnes.

-‘Protactinium~233 inventory is not very sensitive to changes in poison fraction
or fertile stream cycle time. Since Pa-233 is not removed from the system in the
fluoride volatility process, it builds up until its decay rate is exactly equal to
the U-233 production rate, Therefore the Pa-233 ‘inventory will change in direct
proportion to the breeding ratio. For this system the inventory is in the range
100-110 kg. | |

6. 1. uy Fuel cyte Cost

A breakdown of the fuel cycle costs for representative cases 1s given in
Tebles 6.2 and 6.3. These costs were calculated using the basic cost data given
in Teble 3.1.

The largest single contribution to the fuel cycle cost is ‘the charge for
the fuel processing plant which contributes up to 40% of the total cost. At
the faster blanket processing rates, the fertile stream processing plant. cost
also becomes 8 significant part of the total cost; at a 35-day blanket cycle
“time about 30% of the cost may derive from fertile stream processing.

Total inventory charges on fissionable materials, thorium, fuel carrier and
thorium carrier account for 40 ~ 55% of the fuel cycle cost. Individually, the
thorium carrier (~ 200 tonnes) contributes most to the inventory charges, from
15 - 20% of the fuel cycle cost; fissionable inventory contributes about 7 =~ 13%; .
- thorium inventory contributes 12 - 16%; and fuel carrier inventory contributes
the least, only from 1.5 = 2.5%. |

Thorium emortization and thorium carrier replacement charges, vhich are
‘amortized at 2. 6%, are not en appreciable portion of the fuel cycle cost, being
only 2 - 49 of the total. On the other hand, fuel carrier replacement charges

become a significant factor especially at the lower values of poison fraction
because of the high salt discard rate. At very high poison fractions (0. 065),
this contribution is only about 4% of the total fuel cycle cost; vhereas, at low
poison fractions es much as 25% of the cost is due to salt discard.

Breeding credit is an item of the fuel cycle cost that is directly proportional
to the breeding gain and fissionable inventory. The high fuel yield reactors

(6. 8¢/yesr) have breeding credits of about 0.13 mills ivi; in the very highly |
Poisoned reactors (fuel yield & 19/year), the breeding credit is only about

0.04 mills /kvhr. Although allowing the fertile stream cycle: time to increase
from 35 to 200 days lowers the breeding credit through increasing ‘the fissionable
inventory, the effect is not so pronounced as that caused by ‘allowing the poison
fraction to increase.

per neutron ebsorbed in fuel. This range of poison fractions was epplied to
fertile streem cycle time parameters of 35, 50, 75, 100, 150 and 200 days. The

range of poison frections was established after a few preliminary calculations

to: include reactors with quite favorable breeding potential as well as those

that ere ‘approximately "hold-your-own" systems. Poison fractions lower then

0.02 vere not. considered because the required fast processing rates result in

high fuel cycle costs without epprecieble increase in breeding gain. At a poison
fraction of O. 065, ‘the MSER shows & small y positive breeding gein; at higher
poison fractions it is doubtful if the system will breed.

These two parameters could very conveniently be treated in the ERC=5 code
since they are items of input data. The poison fraction as such does not appear
in ERC=5 input; however, the desired poisoning effect ‘can be obtained by using
- fictitious fission product concentrations end fictitious reaction rate coefficients.
The net effect of additional ‘poisons is to decrease the breeding gein and corr-
sponding breeding credit. For each combination of poison fraction and fertile

Fuel Salt Discard Time as a Function of Fuel Cycle Cost. As discussed
in Section 5.0, each value of the fuel stream poison fraction can be attained
by operating the reactor at several values of fuel stream cycle time and fuel
sélt discard cycle time, and there is some combination of these times for which
the fuel cycle cost is & minimum. For each selected value of the ‘fuel stream

‘poison fraction, several pairs of compatible values of these two cycle times

vere chosen from Fig. 5.2, and the total fuel cycle cost was calculsted for each :
peir of values. The fuel cycle time determined the capital investment in the
processing plent; the fuel salt discerd cycle time determined the replacement
charges for the fuel salt. A plot of fuel salt discard cycle time versus fuel
cycle cost at constant poison fraction gave the curves exhibited in Fig. 6.3.

The minimum of each curve represents the point of most economic operation; the
corresponding fuel cycle cost end fuel galt discard cycle time are reed directly.
When the optimum fuel salt discard cycle time is entered into Fig. 5.2, the
optimum fuel stream cycle time. is found.

Optimum values of the fuel. cycle cost, fuel strean cycle time and fuel salt
discard cycle time are given in Tables 6.2 end 6. 5:3:

6. 2.2 Economic Performance

The optimized fuel cycle costs ‘obtained by ‘the above procedure have been
plotted as & function of the fuel yield in Fig. 6.4. The curves have been calcu-
lated for a plant operating 80% of the time. The most favorable fuel ylelds are
obtained et the shortest fertile stream cycle time; however, the corresponding
fuel eycle costs are. high. Likewise ‘the fuel stream must be processed at a
relatively fast rate. as indicated by the lover values of the ‘poison fraction.
Fuel ylelds of the order of T THT « can be attained at a fuel cycle cost of around

1.7 mills/kvhr. =

In the lover renge of fuel yields it ‘appears that fuel cycle costs of O. 75
to 0.80 mills/kvhr can be attained at fuel yields of 1 to 24/yr. These conditions
require fertile stream cycle times of 150 = 200 days. The curves could have been
extended in the lover regions of fuel yields by. performing calculations at higher
values of the poison fraction; however, uncerteinties in ‘basic data, e.g., cross
sections and resonance integrels, would lend doubt as to vhether such a system |
would have a positive breeding gein,

In this series of calculations fuel stream cycle times. ranged from 12 - 8h
days, and fuel salt discard cycle times ranged from 145 - 1550 days. for the case
‘thet fall on the envelope of the curves. EE

The dashed envelope curve has been drawn to indicate the estimated maximum
performance of this reactor. It might be possible to extend the envelope of the
) family of curves out this far by modifications in the C:U ratio in the core and

by optimizing the fertile stream cycle time. These refinements to the calculations

were not made in this study; nevertheless, it is believed that the chosen C:U ratio
is near the optimum.

Along a line of constant fertile stream cycle time, the fuel cycle cost drops
rather sharply from its maximum value principally because of decreased charges on
the fuel stream processing plant at the longer fuel stream cycle times and lower:

fuel salt replacement: charges for the longer salt discard cycle time. During this

initial drop in fuel cycle cost, the breeding credit is also decreasing, but the
initiel loss of breeding credit is far overridden by the savings on the processing

plant and fuel salt replacement mentioned above. Consequently the initial drop in

fuel yield is not as fast as for the fuel cycle cost. Eventually, though, as the

3 processing time becomes long (increasing poison fraction) the savings on the proc-
essing plant and fuel salt discard are not so effective in lowering the fuel cycle

‘cost and the rate of decline decreases. Meanwhile decreasing breeding gain ec
celerates the loss in fuel yield. Ultimately et higher poison fractions then
shown on the graph, a complete loss of breeding gain would necessitate rising
fuel cycle cost because fuel would have to be purchesed.

Along a ine of constant poison fraction in Fig. 6.4, the fuel cycle cost

is affected principally by changes in capital charges on the fertile stream proc-
essing plant and in fissionsble inventory in the fertile stream. ‘The contribution
of the fertile stream processing plent to the fuel cycle cost decreases vith in- -
creasing cycle time while the inventory charges increase. Initially the savings
on ‘the processing plant overveigh the increased inventory charges resulting in
& net lowering of the total fuel cycle cost. At the long cycle times, however,
: the inventory charges overbalance the lower plant costs and ‘the fuel cycle cost
: reaches a - minimum and begins to rise.

The decrease in fuel yield along a line of constant poison fraction is not:
lerge and is due primerily to increasing inventory of fissionable material in the
systen. ‘There 1s also the adverse effect that > higher u-235 c concentrations at the

longer fertile stream cycle times have on the mean velue of 1 - an effect that
lowers the fuel yield through lover breeding gein.

A series of equilibrium reactor calculations was made for & renge of fuel
stream poison fractions from 0.011 ~ 0.065 neutrons ebsorbed in fission products
per neutron absorbed in fuel. This range of poison fractions was applied to
fertile stream cycle time parameters of 35, 50, 75, 100, 150, end 200 days and
is broader than that considered in Section 6.2 for the resonance absorption cases.
When fission products are treated as 1/v gbsorbers, the poisoning effect is not
‘as great as when the resonance gbsorptions are included, end it is therefore
poseible to extend the range of celculetions to lower poison frections before
intolerably short fuel stream cycle times are reached.

The equilibrium celculetions vere made using the ERC-5 code for the IBM-TOk
by verying the fertile stream cycle time end by using fictitious fissium concen-
trations and reaction rate coefficients es mentioned in Section 6.2. These calcu~-
lations were performed et the beginning of this thorium breeder study before a
compilation of resonance integral: dete beceme available ’ end it appeared that
treating the fission products es 1/v absorbers was the best approach to the
problem. Therefore » the results reported below should be considered as an
optimistic upper limit to the ‘fuel yield end an optimistic lower limit to the
fuel cycle cost.

6.31 Ecanomic Performance | : BE - oe

The optimized fuel cycle costs obtained by the above procedure are plotted
‘as a function of the fuel yield in Fig. 6. Se These fuel cycle costs and fuel
yields should be regarded as ‘rether optimistic ‘values since considerable neutron BE
economy resulted from the assumption that the fission products behaved as 1/v
absorbers. Consequently it is believed that ‘these curves represent - e lower
bound to the MSER fuel cycle costs; more realistic performance is that repre-
sented by Fig. 6.4 in which ‘the best evaileble resonance - absorption data vere
included.

For the conditions of Fig. 6.5, fuel yields as high as about 8%/yr at a
“fuel cycle cost of about 1.3 mi11s/kvhr vere obtained; e minimum fuel cycle

6.4 Effect on Reactor Performance of Varying Thor un Inventory

In order to study the breeding performance of the MSER over a wide range of
operating conditions y the “thorium inventory was varied in the range 100 - 400 tonnes

in & few representative. calculations. for vhich the fertile Stream cycle time was

rm.

35 days, the fuel ‘stream cycle time was 20 days, and the fuel salt discard time

was 1000 days. The thorium inventory was varied by. adjusting the fertile stream
volume in the range 2000: - 9000 £t3 per: station. This particular series of calcu-
lations was. made at en early stage of the study, and the combination of cycle times
is not optimum with respect to fuel cycle costs at the verious fuel ylelds. How- °
ever, ‘the dependency of fuel yield and cost’ on: thorium inventory is only weakly
affected, 1f at all, ’ “by choice of cycle times. Therefore the behavior exhibited
by the selected cases 1s ‘typical end may be used as a guide in selecting thorium
inventories. The important results of these calculations are given in Table 6.4.

As the thorium inventory. increases, losses to Pa-233 decrease, and there
are gains in respect to mean eta and U-236 absorptions. Breeding gain increases,
but at a decreasing rate. Meanwhile fuel inventory in the fertile stream rises.
As & result, fuel yield rises rapidly at first, and then more slowly as the in-
fluence of increasing inventory overrides that of breeding gain. The cost in-
creases steadily, hovever, being driven upward by increased charges for thorium
and uranium. The fuel yield reaches & point of negligible improvement at 270 .
tonnes of thorium, and this thorium inventory was used for further studies re-
ported above in Sections 6.1 = 6.3. . oo

One hundred tonnes of thorium is not sufficient to fill the blanket of the
‘reactor used in this study when the blanket thickness is 3 ft. ‘In the corre-
sponding calculations, no adjustment was made for the greater leakage that would
result from a thinner blanket. Thus for the case in the ebove tebulation, the
fuel yield should be less and the fuel cycle cost higher than ‘calculated. "Ac-
cordingly the 140-tonne case was  eisctsd as a representative Lov-thoriun | case
for further study. TL

For the 140-tonne ‘thorium fertile strean, a series of calculations | was made
to optimize ‘the fuel cycle cost. end the fuel yield at a representative fertile
stream cycle time (s0 days). A comparison between these results and those of
the corresponding 270-tonne thorium case are presented in Teble 6. 5.

The results of Table 6. 5 were obtained for optimized fuel stream cycle
times and fuel salt discard tines, and in ll celculetions the resonance ab- .
sorptions of fission ‘products were included in the poison fraction calculations.
The two cycle times are longest for the low fuel ylelds and shortest for the
high yield cases. Although some slight trend with fuel stream cycle time is
observed, ‘the rule can be formulated that doubling the thorium inventory adds
about 1.9%/yr to the fuel yield and about O. 2 mills/kvhr to ‘the fuel" cycle cost
regardless of the fuel stream cycle times.

The performance of the MSBER containing 140 tonnes and 270 tonnes of thorium
is graphed in Fig. 6.6. The solid curve which is drawn through the calculated
points is the envelope curve of Fig. 6.4. The dashed curve is an estimated curve,
based on the few 140-tonne thorium cases, for. the maximum performance of the MSBR ..
at this low thorium inventory. The solid outer curve was then drawn to indicate the

improvement in the reactor cen be found by & slight varietion in the C:U ratio.
The C:U ratio (~ 5000) in this reactor was not optinized, but thie value is be-
lieved to be near the optimum.

The 140-tonne thorium case is also plotted in Figs. 6.7 and 6.8 for optimized
fuel cycle times end for a range ‘of poison fractions from 0.011 = 0.065.

6:5 Effect of Value of 7-233 on MSER Performance

Uncertainty in the measured values of the epithermal fission cross sections
. of U=~233 can cause considerable variation in the calculated performance of the
MSER, depending on the set of cross section values that is used. This is the
case because approximately 30% of total fissions occurs at epithermal energies.
Reported epithermal values of 3-233 apparently agree within ebout % t 10% of an
‘average or "recommended" set of values.

Several calculations for & representative operating condition were made
using the GNU. and ERC-5 programs for the IBM~TOk to determine the effect of
these 1 variations. The plots of Figs. 6.7 and 6.8 show the effect for cases
in which fission product resonsnce absorptions were included - and for cases con-
sidering fission products to be 1/v sbsorbers. ‘There 1s considerable variation
in the fuel yield, as measured by the horizontal distance between corresponding
points on the curves, between the ‘recommended curve and the high and low epi-
thermal eta curves. The deviation from the recommended value is £ 2.5 to

% 3%/yr in fuel yield. In fact, using the more pessimistic velues of 7 makes
it difficult to attain fuel yields of as mach | as s hifyr even at fuel cycle costs
ae high as 1.6 mills/kvhr.

On the other hand the choice of high or low epithermal 1-233 does not have
& strong influence on the fuel cycle cost. This effect is measured by the verti-
cel difference between corresponding points on the three curves. This difference
is approximately ¥ 0.06 mills/kwhr from the recommended curve.

The various values of 1-233 are tabulated in Table 6.6... The column headed
7 (MIR) contains values from experiments performed at the Materials Testing Reactor
end are the values recommended by Nestor for use in this study. The coluims
headed n(+ 10%) and n(- 10%) contain the extreme values used to obtain the two
curves of Figs. 6. T end 6.8 for comparison with the recommended values. Values
in all energy groups differ by 10% from the MIR values except in group 31 where !
the difference is only 5% end in groups 32 through 34 where the values were not
changed. The other values headed n(RFI) ere presented for comparison since these
are recent data from a study by Yester.'? The RPI set of values are not thought
to be more relieble than the MIR values; however, ‘in the energy range 30 ev =~
1 kev the RPI dste represent the only measurements that have been made.

6.6 Effect of Velue of ‘Pa=233 Resonance Integrel on MSER Performence

‘A second nuclear constant that is perhaps not known very eccurately is the
velue of the resonance integral of Pa-233. Figures of 600, 900, end 1200 ‘barns
have been mentioned for the’ value of this integral. As mentioned in Section 3.7,
& velue of 1200 barns was chosen for this study. However, in order to determine
vhet effect a lover value of the resonance integral would have on reactor per=
formance, — calculations ‘were made at representative operating conditions
using & 900-barn resonance integral for comparison vith the 1200-barn cases. The
resulting curves for the reactor performance are plotted in Fig. 6.7 end 6.8.

The improvement that the lower value of the resonance integral makes in.
the MSER performance is hardly eppreciable. The fuel yield, measured by the
horizontal difference between corresponding points, is increased by perhaps
0. 25%/year; the fuel cycle cost ’ measured by the vertical difference, is lowered
by ebout 0. 01 mills /kvhr. The small effect on performance is understendsble
when it is considered that losses to Pa-233 account for only about 0. 5% of the

neutrons born per fuel absorption using the 1200-barn resonance integral. How=-

ever of all the neutron ebsorptions in Pe-233, spproximately 80% occur at epi-
thermal energies.

The comparative 900-barn resonance integrel calculations were performed
using the ERC-5 code with adjusted values of the reaction rate coefficients,
vhich are defined above in Section 4.h. The adjustment was made using output -
data from a Cornpone finite reactor calculation giving the ebsorptions. in Pa-233
es a function of energy. The reaction rate coefficients were calculated sepa-
rately for the thermal absorptions end the epithermal absorptions s the epithermal
value being decreased by the ratio of the resonance integrals, i.e. ’ 900:1200,
The two values for the coefficients were summed to ‘obtain the total reaction rate

6.7 Effect on MSER Performance of Adding ZrF to Fuel Salt

Recent developments in fuel technology for the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment
(MSRE) have indicated that fuel stability is enhanced by the addition of nominal
amounts of ZrFq to the fuel salt. Zirconium acts es & "getter" for oxygen
 

 

-80 =

preventing the union of oxygen and urenium which results ‘in the precipitation
of uranium oxides. The inclusion of zirconium, however, adds an additional

neutron poison to the | system.

‘The effect on breeding ratio and fuel yield of adding 5 mole % ZrF, to the
fuel salt was calculated for the ranges of values representative of the MSER. |
The results are plotted in Fig. 6.9. The curves show the per cent decrease in
breeding ratio and fuel yleld resulting from the addition of 2rFs es a function
of these quantities for a reactor containing no ZrFe. As might be expected,
the detrimentel effect of the ZrF4 is more pronounced for the reactors that have
initially poor breeding performance. In fact the steepness of the fuel yield ’
curve at fuel yields of the order of 2-3%/yr ‘suggests that adding ZrFg¢ to a low
performance reactor can just sbout destroy its breeding potential.

The Zr-containing salt used in the calculations had the composition of fuel
solution proposed for the MSRE: T70-23=5-1~1 mole % LiF-BeFz-ZrF4~ThF¢~UFq.

In order to determine the effect of 5 mole % ZrFq on & representative per-
formance curve, the results of Fig. 6.9 were applied to equilibrium reactor cal-
culations for a fertile stream cycle time of 50 deys. The results were optimized

according to fuel stream cycle time and fuel salt discard time. The horizontal

difference between corresponding points in Fig. 6.10 shows that Zr decreases the
fuel yield about 0.5%/yr; whereas, the fuel cycle cost, measured by the vertical
difference, is almost negligibly affected. The effect on fuel cycle cost is
small because the effect shows up through the loss in breeding credit which is
not a large portion of the total fuel cycle cost.

7.0 CONCLUSIONS

‘The molten salt reactor offers considerable promise as a breeder in the
Th~U cycle, The principal advantage of this system over other breeding systems,
which use thorium in the form of the oxide or metal, is in the simplified chemical
processing method. The molten salt systen is able to use the relatively simple
fluoride volatility process plus the HF dissolution process for uranium recovery
end decontemination; whereas, breeders which employ ThOz or thorium metal are,
in the light of current technology, resigned to the more complicated and €Xe-
pensive Thorex process. ’

‘The MSER is capable of excess fuel yields up to T%/year when operating 80%
of the time. At this high yield, the fuel cycle cost 1s about 1.65 mills /kvhr.
At lower fuel yields the fuel cycle cost is considerably improved, dropping to
perheps 0.65 mills/kvhr for fuel yields of 1-2¢/year. However, yields as low

‘as this constitute marginal operation beceuse uncerteinties in nuclear data

introduce uncertainties of about & per cent in fuel yield into the calculetions.
At & fuel yield of 4%/yesr, the point at which the income from sales just balances.
the snmial charge on fisslonsble inventory, the fuel cycle cost 16 epproximately
0.9 mills/kvhr.

The largest contribution to the fuel eyele cost is made by the fuel stream
processing plant which accounts for ebout 119 of the cost at the high processing
rates (high fuel yield) and ebout 30% of the cost at the low processing rates.
Another item that makes & major contribution to the cost at the high processing
rates 1s the fuel salt discard, accounting for slightly more than 204 of the
total; however - at the low processing rates, ’ salt discard accounts for only about
be, | | | a i oo

The fertile stream processing plant cost emounte to only 12-15% of the total.
Thorium inventory for the 6000 £3 fertile stream amounts to 8-17% of the cost.
Since the thorium inventory is constant (270 tonnes ), its cost is a larger por=
tion of the cost for those cases that have the most fevorsble fuel cycle costs.
The same is true for the thorium carrier which accounts for 10-22% of the fuel
cycle cost over the range of fuel yields from T%/yr to 1%/yr.
 

 

Co .8h

Fissionable inventory (including Pa-233) is only slightly affected by the \~/
processing rate of the fuel stream over most of the range of poison fractions
studied. However, at the fast fuel stream cycle times. the holdup in the chemical
processing plant begins to contribute importantly to the inventory. The principal
factor increasing the inventory 1s the fertile stream cycle time. In going from
~& fertile stream cycle time of 35 days to 200 days, the fissionable inventory
increases from about 840 to 1280 kg. At the seme time, fertile stream fissions
increase from 1.3% to 6.6% of the total fissions. The fissionable inventory:
accounts for about 15% of the fuel cycle cost at a fuel yield of 1. SH and for
about 4% et a yield of T4/yr. :

The breeding performance of the molten: salt reactor is especially sensitive
to the value assigned to the epithermal fission cross section of U-233 since"
ebout 30% of the fissions occurs at epithermal energies o Equilibrium reactor
calculations for a representative set ‘of operating conditions indicate that the
fuel yield may vary as much as ¥ 2.5 to '3¢/yr for variations of * 10% in the
value of the epithermal cross sections of U-233 from the set used in these
calculations.

The inclusion of 5 mole 9 ZrF¢ in the fuel salt to ‘enhence stability den |
creases the fuel yield about 0.5%/year; however, the concurrent fuel cycle cost
is negligibly increased. The MSER already suffers from having relatively high
neutron absorbers in the molten salt carriers s 85 compared with graphite and
heavy water in other breeder reactors, and the sddition of any other atom with
appreciable cross section can only lower the breeding performance. I

There are two ways of improving the breeding performance of the MSER. These
are (1) determining the optimum C:U ratio and (2) increasing the thorium inventory
in the blanket. In regard to the C:U ratio, it is believed that the value of
approximately 5100 used in these calculations is near the optimum and that only
a very slight improvement might be expected by changing the reactor composition. -
The most significant improvement in the MSER breeding performance can be made
by increasing the thorium inventory in the fertile stream. In the blanket,
Pa~-233 competes with thorium for neutrons; hence the losses to Pa-233 are in- = =~
versely proportional to the thorium concentration. However this improved breed-
ing performance comes at the expense of additional charges for thorium and fertile <

salt inventory, and the net effect on the fuel cycle cost will be an increase.
Above & 270-tonne thorium inventory, which was used in this study, the increased
breeding credit is insufficient to offset increased thorium end fertile salt

“inventory charges.

The molten salt reactor conceived for this study necessarily includes
some elements of design which are perhaps beyond current technology, e.g. leak=
proof graphite-to-metal joints end impervious graphite that permits minimum xenon *
ebsorption. "In chemical processing, further demonstration of the fluoride vola-
tility process end the HF dissolution process is necessary to supply edequate
design information. Co Co Co

Footnotes for Tables 6.2 and 6.3

The element fissium is & conglomeration of fission products. A
fictitious reaction rate coefficient and concentration were ase

signed to fuel stream fissium es explained above in Section 4.5
to echieve the desired poison fraction. The concentration of
- fertile stream fissium was calculated by ERC=5 using reection

rate coefficients ‘developed from GNU end Cornpone output.

All Xe-135 1s assigned to the fuel stream. It hes been: assumed -
that a gas purge of fuel and blanket solutions will maintain Xe-135
absorptions at 0.005 neutrons per neutron absorbed in fuel. :

Based on 11-7 etons.

The ebsorption cross section of the fertile stream carrier was

horpalized to the basis of one thorium atom.
U-235 in fertile stream is negligible.

Includes thorium burned up in breeding plus thorium ¢ discarded on

20-year cycle.

Fertile salt is discarded on a 20-year cycle to matntain blanket
fission products at a tolerable level.

The concentrations ere written with the letter ng used to denote

the exponent, e.g., read 0.8892E-} as 0.8892 x 10-4.

Replacement salt for fuel and fertile stream carrier is assumed

to contein Li that is 0.01 atom % Li-6. Absorptions. are based on

equilibrium 1i-6 concentration for thls feed. =
